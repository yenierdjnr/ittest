00:00:19.180\nalready produced.\n\n6\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.370\nKeep in mind that we're gonna talk a\nlittle bit about what is the 220-902 exam?\n\n7\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.450\nWhat is this course or\nwho is this course for?\n\n8\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.740\nWhat will be covered?\n\n9\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.680\nAs well as what are gonna be\nsome of the exam details?\n\n10\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.420\nSo that you can have a little bit\nbetter understanding of what you\n\n11\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320\nmight face when you decide to\ntake the certification exam.\n\n12\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.920\nNow when it comes to the CompTIA\n220-902 exam, please keep in mind\n\n13\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.459\nto become A+ certified you have to\nhave already passed the 901 exam.\n\n14\n00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.838\nNow you can take these in any order,\nwe do want you to understand that,\n\n15\n00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:53.332\nthat you can take 902 and you can pass\nthat, and then you can go back and\n\n16\n00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.760\nyou can take the 901 exam, likewise.\n\n17\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.900\nBut in order to become A+ certified,\n\n18\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.030\nyou do have to have both 901 and\n902 passing scores under your belt.\n\n19\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.820\nThis is a vendor neutral certification.\n\n20\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.590\nIt's also a worldwide accreditation.\n\n21\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.860\nOne of the things that CompTIA strives\nto do is not be focused, really,\n\n22\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.630\non any one individual vendor, but\nunderstanding a broad range of concepts.\n\n23\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.880\nSo that you can take these skills and\nyou can apply them to a lot\n\n24\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.720\nof different pieces of software and\na lot of different operating systems too.\n\n25\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.495\nAs well as,

Defense and that is 8140 or 8570.01-m.\n\n32\n00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.707\nSo it does fall in those compliance\nif that is what you are seeking.\n\n33\n00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660\nNow who is this

follows a lot of the same format\n\n58\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.170\nof the first 220-901 exam and\nthe fact that it has 90 questions and\n\n59\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.820\nit's gonna be 90 minutes.\n\n60\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.770\nYou will have questions\nthat are multiple choice.\n\n61\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.160\nYou will have some questions\nthat require multiple answers,\n\n62\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.040\nwhich means that you will be required to\nhave more than one answer to represent\n\n63\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.850\na complete solution to\nget the question right.\n\n64\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.200\nUnderstand as well you will also have\nthings like simulations on the exam too.\n\n65\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.550\nWhere you're gonna have to have a\npractical application of the concepts that\n\n66\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.340\nyou're learning throughout the 902 series.\n\n67\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.520\nAs well as performance based\nquestions that do things like for\n\n68\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.610\ninstance drag and drop.\n\n69\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.870\nSo where they ask you and they give\nyou a list of potential answers and\n\n70\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.680\nyou have to drag and\ndrop them in the right order\n\n71\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.780\nto complete whatever the scenario\nis requiring you to accomplish.\n\n72\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.705\nNow the passing score is a little\nbit more than the 901, 901 was 675,\n\n73\n00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.040\nin this one we're gonna be looking at 700.\n\n74\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.380\n700 is the minimum passing score and\nthat is a range from 100 to 900.\n\n75\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.248\nAt the time of this recording,\nthe CompTIA A+ 220-902 exam,\n\n76\n00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:31.957\nrequired here in the US,\nthe US dollars, $205 US.\n\n77\n00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:35.030\nNow the recommended experience,\nunderstand that it is recommended but\n\n78\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.760\nit is not required and there's no prior\ncertification requirements if you will,\n\n79\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.600\nin order to sit and take the 902 exam.\n\n80\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.440\nBut it is recommended that you have\n6 to 12 months on hands on labs\n\n81\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.660\nwithin any kind of software virtualization\nenvironment where you have hands on lab.\n\n82\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.580\nWhere you're again learning\nthe technologies and\n\n83\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580\nhaving some kind of practical application.\n\n84\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.764\nOr it's also recommended that\nyou have anywhere from 6\n\n85\n00:05:00.764 --> 00:05:05.449\nto 12 months field experience that helps\nyou to be better prepared for the exam.\n\n86\n00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.542\nIf these seem like something that you,\nas a candidate, potential candidate for\n\n87\n00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:17.382\nthe CompTIA A+ 220-902 exam will\nrequire and this series is for you.\n\n88\n00:05:19.972 --> 00:05:24.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
