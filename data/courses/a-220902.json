in\n\n3\n00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.624\nthe CompTIA's 220-902 course.\n\n4\n00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:17.201\nThis is gonna be a follow up to\nthe 220-901 series that we've\n\n5\n00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:19.180\nalready produced.\n\n6\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.370\nKeep in mind that we're gonna talk a\nlittle bit about what is the 220-902 exam?\n\n7\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.450\nWhat is this course or\nwho is this course for?\n\n8\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.740\nWhat will be covered?\n\n9\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.680\nAs well as what are gonna be\nsome of the exam details?\n\n10\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.420\nSo that you can have a little bit\nbetter understanding of what you\n\n11\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320\nmight face when you decide to\ntake the certification exam.\n\n12\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.920\nNow when it comes to the CompTIA\n220-902 exam, please keep in mind\n\n13\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.459\nto become A+ certified you have to\nhave already passed the 901 exam.\n\n14\n00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.838\nNow you can take these in any order,\nwe do want you to understand that,\n\n15\n00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:53.332\nthat you can take 902 and you can pass\nthat, and then you can go back and\n\n16\n00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.760\nyou can take the 901 exam, likewise.\n\n17\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.900\nBut in order to become A+ certified,\n\n18\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.030\nyou do have to have both 901 and\n902 passing scores under your belt.\n\n19\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.820\nThis is a vendor neutral certification.\n\n20\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.590\nIt's also a worldwide accreditation.\n\n21\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.860\nOne of the things that CompTIA strives\nto do is not be focused, really,\n\n22\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.630\non any one individual vendor, but\nunderstanding a broad range of concepts.\n\n23\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.880\nSo that you can take these skills and\nyou can apply them to a lot\n\n24\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.720\nof different pieces of software and\na lot of different operating systems too.\n\n25\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.495\nAs well as, when you do get certified\ndoesn't matter if you're here in\n\n26\n00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:32.965\nthe United States, where we're filming\nthis episode, or if you're in Barcelona,\n\n27\n00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.805\nSpain, or\nmay be you're in Australia as well,\n\n28\n00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.455\nthat you're certifications\nare gonna be just as valid.\n\n29\n00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:39.715\nNow if you are here in the States,\n\n30\n00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:45.507\nunderstand that this is also endorsed with\na compliance standard for the Department\n\n31\n00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:50.087\nof Defense and that is 8140 or 8570.01-m.\n\n32\n00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.707\nSo it does fall in those compliance\nif that is what you are seeking.\n\n33\n00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660\nNow who is this course for?\n\n34\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.220\nPlease understand that this course is for\n\n35\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.480\nany candidate that requires\na validation of the common software

of corporate networks, too.\n\n38\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.770\nCandidates will need,\nif you need an understanding of\n\n39\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.630\nthe Windows Operating System then\nthis course is definitely for you.\n\n40\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.600\nAny candidate that needs to be able\nto perform trouble shooting on\n\n41\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.500\nWindows Operating Systems or other\noperating system technologies and some of\n\n42\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000\nthe utilities and tools that you will see\ninside of those various operating systems.\n\n43\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.130\nCandidates who are preparing\nto take the 220-902 exam,\n\n44\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.570\nshould definitely have this\ncourse under their belt.\n\n45\n00:02:37.070 -->

00:02:48.860\nWell, the objectives for\nexam code, A+ 220-902.\n\n48\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.300\nFundamental Windows Operating Systems and\nthe tools and\n\n49\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.740\nutilities that you see within\ninside those operating systems.\n\n50\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.145\nBasic professionalism and\n\n51\n00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:01.290\ncommunication skills and the different\ntechniques that you can implement.\n\n52\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.610\nFundamental operational procedures and\nsafety procedures as well.\n\n53\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.280\nAs well as,\n\n54\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.610\nthe fundamentals of troubleshooting\nthe Windows Operating System.\n\n55\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.350\nLast but not least,\nwhat are some of the exam details?\n\n56\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.070\nWhat can you expect when you\ndo decide to take this exam?\n\n57\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.200\nWell, we want you to understand that the\n220-902 follows a lot of the same format\n\n58\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.170\nof the first 220-901 exam and\nthe fact that it has 90 questions and\n\n59\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.820\nit's gonna be 90 minutes.\n\n60\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.770\nYou will have questions\nthat are multiple choice.\n\n61\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.160\nYou will have some questions\nthat require multiple answers,\n\n62\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.040\nwhich means that you will be required to\nhave more than one answer to represent\n\n63\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.850\na complete solution to\nget the question right.\n\n64\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.200\nUnderstand as well you will also have\nthings like simulations on the exam too.\n\n65\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.550\nWhere you're gonna have to have a\npractical application of the concepts that\n\n66\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.340\nyou're learning throughout the 902 series.\n\n67\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.520\nAs well as performance based\nquestions that do things like for\n\n68\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.610\ninstance drag and drop.\n\n69\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.870\nSo where they ask you and they give\nyou a list of potential answers and\n\n70\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.680\nyou have to drag and\ndrop them in the right order\n\n71\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.780\nto complete whatever the scenario\nis requiring you to accomplish.\n\n72\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.705\nNow the passing score is a little\nbit more than the 901, 901 was 675,\n\n73\n00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.040\nin this one we're gonna be looking at 700.\n\n74\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.380\n700 is the minimum passing score and\nthat is a range from 100 to 900.\n\n75\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.248\nAt the time of this recording,\nthe CompTIA A+ 220-902 exam,\n\n76\n00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:31.957\nrequired here in the US,\nthe US dollars, $205 US.\n\n77\n00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:35.030\nNow the recommended experience,\nunderstand that it is recommended but\n\n78\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.760\nit is not required and there's no prior\ncertification requirements if you will,\n\n79\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.600\nin order to sit and take the 902 exam.\n\n80\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.440\nBut it is recommended that you have\n6 to 12 months on hands on labs\n\n81\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.660\nwithin any kind of software virtualization\nenvironment where you have hands on lab.\n\n82\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.580\nWhere you're again learning\nthe technologies and\n\n83\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580\nhaving some kind of practical application.\n\n84\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.764\nOr it's also recommended that\nyou have anywhere from 6\n\n85\n00:05:00.764 --> 00:05:05.449\nto 12 months field experience that helps\nyou to be better prepared for the exam.\n\n86\n00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.542\nIf these seem like something that you,\nas a candidate, potential candidate for\n\n87\n00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:17.382\nthe CompTIA A+ 220-902 exam will\nrequire and this series is for you.\n\n88\n00:05:19.972 --> 00:05:24.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:12.346\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:17.300\nAll right greetings everyone and welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.720\nI'm your hose Daniel Lowrie and in todays\nepisode we are kicking off our second half\n\n6\n00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.160\nof the A + series 22902 for\nthose of you keeping score.\n\n7\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.680\nWe're moving into more software\nbased things than hardware.\n\n8\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.470\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun to take\nthis journey when joining us to help\n\n9\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.040\nguide our way, our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.500\nWes, we're glad to have you back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.025\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:39.840\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.700\nLooking forward to, like you said,\nthis journey that we are kicking off here.\n\n14\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.782\nYou know, I was placing bets,\nI was like he was going to say 22901 and\n\n15\n00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:46.645\nyou let me down man.\n\n16\n00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.829\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.-\n\n17\n00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:49.708\n&gt;&gt; I lost a little money on\n\n18\n00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:50.217\nthat one.-\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n19\n00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:51.390\n&gt;&gt; That's right so, we are,\n\n20\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.450\nas Dan said we are going to be focusing\non a lot more on the software side.\n\n21\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.430\nNow keep in mind that in the 901\nwe talked about hardware.\n\n22\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.890\nAnd we'll kind of do some recaps as\nwe go through talking about some of\n\n23\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.620\nthe software.\n\n24\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.650\nAnd the pieces of software\nthat you'll use to well,\n\n25\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350\nto troubleshoot some of\nthe hardware as well.\n\n26\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.550\nBecause, we have all kinds\nof different utilities, and\n\n27\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.480\none of the great things is, we're not\nonly gonna be focused on Windows.\n\n28\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.950\nOne of the things you have to know, and\n\n29\n00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.270\nI really really enjoy the fact that\nComp Tia, especially in the 900 series.\n\n30\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.742\nIs focused in on talking a little bit more\nabout Linux, a little bit more about Mac.\n\n31\n00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:27.969\nWhere in the earlier days\nit's faced I've been teaching\n\n32\n00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.600\nA + since gosh I wanna say sounds\nlike the fibre one exam objectives.\n\n33\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.620\nAnd here we have four\ndifferent series later, 901.\n\n34\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.385\nAnd in the earlier days Dan all you\nhad to do was be able to spell Linux,-\n\n35\n00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:39.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] Yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Be able to spell Unix.\n\n37\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.680\nYou didn't have to do\nanything with Mac at all.\n\n38\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.270\nAnd you're going to see that as we\nmove into the software we're going\n\n39\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.820\nto be talking about some of the components\nthat you can find in those other\n\n40\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.780\noperating systems.\n\n41\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.000\nAnd that really for me,\nI don't know, and I know Dan,\n\n42\n00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.050\nI know your a Linux guy and\nthoroughly enjoy Linux.\n\n43\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.830\nFor me, it's exciting, it's\nchallenging because I really have been\n\n44\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.360\njust stuck inside of\nthe Windows environment.\n\n45\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.040\nSo, it forces me to branch out as well.\n\n46\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.636\nAs I've been teaching 901 and\n\n47\n00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.944\neven learned some of the basics\nbehind the other operating systems.\n\n48\n00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:13.215\nBecause let's face it,\n\n49\n00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:17.270\nif you're going to be a well rounded A+\ntechnician of some sort, chances are,\n\n50\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.398\nthere'll be times that you're gonna be\nworking with other operating systems.\n\n51\n00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:24.924\nAnd especially if you talk about working\non a tech bench, it's not gonna be for\n\n52\n00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:28.800\ninstance everything that comes through\nis just going to be a Windows machine.\n\n53\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.180\nWe're seeing more and more that people\nlove, well they love their Macs.\n\n54\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.437\nThere's reasons Mac are around.\n\n55\n00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:36.218\nNow, that doesn't mean you're not gonna\nsee Linux environment don't get me wrong.\n\n56\n00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:38.540\nBut you have to understand that and\n\n57\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.730\nI certainly don't mean this as\na bombastic or talking down to anybody.\n\n58\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.980\nBut with Linux, Linux does require\na little bit more of a power user.\n\n59\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.110\nAnd a lot of times when you have\npeople that are running Linux,\n\n60\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.090\nthey really already know\ntheir operating system.\n\n61\n00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.570\nAnd again, that's not set in stone.\n\n62\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.040\nWe have things like\nUbuntu out there as well\n\n63\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.380\nthat it's an operating system that has\na lot of the similarities, if you will,\n\n64\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.360\nof Windows and the characteristics\nthat allow you to do basic computing.\n\n65\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.800\nHowever, people that\nare using Linux again,\n\n66\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.160\nthey didn't get into those command lines,\nand get into that operating system for\n\n67\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.410\na lack of knowledge or\naround that operating system.\n\n68\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.090\nBut we're gonna start out inside\nof this very first like we said,\n\n69\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.780\nwe're kicking this off and\nwe're gonna be talking about Windows.\n\n70\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.740\nNow, I am going to take a little\nbit of time here guys to explain\n\n71\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.920\nsome of the basic\nfunctionalities in Windows.\n\n72\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.030\nWhen we talk about features there\nare a lot of features that are inside\n\n73\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.920\nthe operating system that you\nreally have to know about.\n\n74\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.440\nBut I really just want to\nstart out with the basics.\n\n75\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.740\nWhen we talk about Windows,\nwell what is Windows?\n\n76\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.954\nWell Windows is the Microsoft\noperating system and\n\n77\n00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.110\nits one of the most\npopular operating systems.\n\n78\n00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.260\nIt's been around.\n\n79\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.820\nGoing all the way back to the days of Dos.\n\n80\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.380\nRight?\nMs Dos was one.\n\n81\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.470\nWe really could if we take a trip\nback in time, we could really\n\n82\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.010\nbe talking about a completely\ndifferent operating system today.\n\n83\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.880\nHad it not been for\nthings like the tenacity of Bill Gates,\n\n84\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.520\nin the earlier days working with IBM.\n\n85\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.180\nAnd Gary Kildall, he's the inventor of\nBIOS, really, I mean the inventor of BIOS.\n\n86\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.230\nWe could be looking at things like CPM,\n\n87\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.100\ncomputer programming for\nmicroprocessor, operating system.\n\n88\n00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.970\nBut the way history kinda works,\nBill Gates was right there with IBM, and\n\n89\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.150\nhe said, hey, we'll give you\nan operating system that you need.\n\n90\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.550\nAnd we'll do whatever you want, and\nsure enough we come out with PC DOS.\n\n91\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.610\nAnd then here's the thing, back in those\nearlier days with all the operating\n\n92\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.760\nsystems, the operating system was really\nnothing more than a text based editor.\n\n93\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.050\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.195\nI'm gonna drop down we're gonna talk\nabout some of these concepts here.\n\n95\n00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.985\nIf we can take a look at my computer.\n\n96\n00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:42.095\nIn the early days when you were\nworking with operating systems,\n\n97\n00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:43.185\nthis is really all you would get.\n\n98\n00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:46.945\nYou would get this text based interface\nand if you didn't know the commands,\n\n99\n00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:48.727\nyou wouldn't work with\nthe operating system.\n\n100\n00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:49.877\nAt all.\n\n101\n00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:53.407\nWell, a lot of the major manufacturers got\nout there and what they did is they gave\n\n102\n00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:56.157\nus more of what's known as a GUI,\na graphical user interface.\n\n103\n00:04:56.157 --> 00:05:00.177\nAnd the graphical user interface allows\nus to perform what's known as point and\n\n104\n00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:01.567\nclick technology.\n\n105\n00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.648\nNow this isn't something\nthat's specific to Microsoft,\n\n106\n00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:08.166\nthey just happened to corner\nthe market in it and revolutionize it.\n\n107\n00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:12.623\nBut honestly, Steve Jobs and Wozniak,\nthey talked about if you go back and\n\n108\n00:05:12.623 --> 00:05:15.965\nyou look at the founder and\nco-founder of Apple there.\n\n109\n00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.832\nThey were talking back in\nthe days of going to Berkeley and\n\n110\n00:05:19.832 --> 00:05:24.506\nfinding Unix systems that had wrapped\nthis graphical user interface\n\n111\n00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:28.830\naround these text based\nprompts that you would see.\n\n112\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.920\nAnd that's really one of the reasons\nWindows, these systems have become\n\n113\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.670\nreally one of the most popular\ninside of the work environments and\n\n114\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.790\ncorporate environments today\nbecause of the ease of use, right?\n\n115\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.005\nWe have what's known as\nthe Graphical User Interface.\n\n116\n00:05:43.005 --> 00:05:47.025\nAnd again you can see the Graphical User\nInterface gives me a series of icons and\n\n117\n00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:48.605\na cursor here that.\n\n118\n00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:52.091\nAnd Bill Gates coined this phrase,\nI remember learning this very early on,\n\n119\n00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:53.675\nthis Point and Click technology.\n\n120\n00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:57.037\nAnd in fact you can see the Mac Toolbar\nkinda coming up in the background.\n\n121\n00:05:57.037 --> 00:06:01.262\nSo it gives you the ability that I can\ninteract with the operating system,\n\n122\n00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:05.980\nwhich really, don't know to much about it\nright, to be able to interact with it.\n\n123\n00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.730\nSo I wanna go ahead, I just just wanna\nkinda separate one of the main features of\n\n124\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.840\nWindows here is that we're really\ngraphically user interface base,\n\n125\n00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.540\ngooey based if you will.\n\n126\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.690\nVerses something like a command line\ninterface which is really akin to\n\n127\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.040\na terminal.\n\n128\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.450\nYou might hear it called a terminal,\n\n129\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.270\nyou might hear it called\na command line interpreter.\n\n130\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.805\nAnd a command line interpreter\nthis is all you get.\n\n131\n00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:34.355\nYou enter text based commands and\nguess what you get text based output.\n\n132\n00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:37.635\nSo, know that that's one of the things\nthat kinda set Windows apart.\n\n133\n00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:38.445\nNow it doesn't today.\n\n134\n00:06:38.445 --> 00:06:43.095\nIt's not unique to Windows today cuz\nthere's tons of options out there\n\n135\n00:06:43.095 --> 00:06:44.615\nacross the board.\n\n136\n00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:49.449\nSo let's go ahead and let's move into\nsome of the features of Windows that they\n\n137\n00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.952\ncall out more specifically on the exam.\n\n138\n00:06:51.952 --> 00:06:55.948\nWhat they call out is something\nknown as 32-bit and 64-bit.\n\n139\n00:06:55.948 --> 00:07:00.540\nAnd you have to understand that\nit's not just the architecture.\n\n140\n00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.370\nAs far as the hardware,\nit's also the operating system in general.\n\n141\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.570\nNow they're both closely tied together.\n\n142\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.920\nWhen we talk about\na 32-bit operating system,\n\n143\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.720\nwhat we're talking about is basically,\nhow much memory can we address?\n\n144\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.810\nNow, if we had a 32-bit hardware platform\nwith a 3- bit operating system on it.\n\n145\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.380\nRemember that everything in our operating,\neverything in computing really,\n\n146\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.310\nis based on binary.\n\n147\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.980\nAnd usually we can kind of figure\nout calculations if you will and\n\n148\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.520\nthe amounts and quantities and\ndata measurement by binary calculations.\n\n149\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.170\nSo it's an exponential value.\n\n150\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.632\nAnd if we look at two to the power of 32.\n\n151\n00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:42.390\nA 32-bit operating system does have\na limitation in the fact that you can only\n\n152\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.490\nsee essentially four gigs of RAM.\n\n153\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.870\nNow 64-bit operating systems.\n\n154\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.088\nWhen we talk about 64-bit, as they mention\nhere in your exam objectives, 64-bit,\n\n155\n00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:56.426\nif we say two to the power of 64,\nI think it´s something outrageous.\n\n156\n00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:58.703\nIt´s like 16 egzabytes.\n\n157\n00:07:58.703 --> 00:07:59.415\n&gt;&gt; That´s a lot.\n\n158\n00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.390\n&gt;&gt; It really is, Dan.\n\n159\n00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.793\nAnd so to give you an idea about\negzabytes In one day the entirety\n\n160\n00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:07.950\nof the world wide Internet,\nWorld Wide Web,\n\n161\n00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.570\nmoves around eight exabytes of\ninformation in a single day.\n\n162\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.145\nEvery single computer,\ndevice that's connected to the Internet.\n\n163\n00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:18.535\nAnd we're talking twice\nthat amount of information.\n\n164\n00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:22.555\nNow, that being said,\nwe don't have systems out there\n\n165\n00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:27.125\nthat really support that amount of\ntheoretical addressable memory, right?\n\n166\n00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.145\nThat's more theory than it is anything.\n\n167\n00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:31.195\nIt isn't practical by any means.\n\n168\n00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:34.970\nSo that being said,\nwe wanna tell you that,\n\n169\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.130\nwhen you talk about 64-bit they\nsay unlimited memory, right.\n\n170\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.300\nAgain, theoretically.\n\n171\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.040\nBecause you do have certain limitations\ninside of your operating systems where\n\n172\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.380\nthe programmers say hey,\nif you wanna address a lot of memory,\n\n173\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.987\nyou're gonna pay for a more expensive\nversion of the operating system, right?\n\n174\n00:08:50.987 --> 00:08:53.660\nThe same thing goes with\nthe hardware manufacturers.\n\n175\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.800\nAgain, these are tied together,\nthey're in the same boat,\n\n176\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.520\nrowing down down the same stream.\n\n177\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.510\nYour hardware also has a limitation.\n\n178\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.280\nJust because you have a 64-bit hardware\nplatform, your motherboard and\n\n179\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.340\nRAM, doesn't necessarily mean\nthat the motherboard, itself,\n\n180\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.700\ncan address some ungodly amount\nof memory capacities, right?\n\n181\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.930\nWe've seen like for instance,\nlet's take our Mac Books,\n\n182\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.810\neven though this is more\nof a Windows episode.\n\n183\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.230\nOur Mac Books can only support\n16 gigs of RAM, right?\n\n184\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:28.006\nThat's not a limitation of the 64-bit\narchitecture, that's what Apple decided in\n\n185\n00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:31.373\nthis version of their hardware\nthey were going to limit it to.\n\n186\n00:09:31.373 --> 00:09:34.570\nAnd if you want more you essentially\npay for a bigger platform.\n\n187\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.010\nWell Windows does the same thing.\n\n188\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.862\nInside of Windows you'll\nsee that you have like for\n\n189\n00:09:38.862 --> 00:09:41.925\ninstance in Windows 7 you\nhave Home Premium edition.\n\n190\n00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:46.511\nAnd Home Premium edition could be\na 64-bit implementation of Windows,\n\n191\n00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:52.070\nwhich means that you could potentially see\nsome things like 64 gigs of RAM, right?\n\n192\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.710\nBut you're not really gonna get more,\n\n193\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.480\nyou're not gonna get the higher amounts,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.590\nIf you get Ultimate,\nI think the Ultimate's 128 gigs of RAM.\n\n195\n00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.580\nBut there again, 128 gigs of RAM,\n\n196\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.990\nif you pay attention to 901 in our\nhardware section, we don't have a lot of\n\n197\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.330\nmotherboards out there right now that\nare really supporting that level of RAM.\n\n198\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.741\nThey are there, but\nthey're very, very expensive.\n\n199\n00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:12.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n200\n00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:16.567\nWe're talking server level hardware\nusually when you're jumping up into that\n\n201\n00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:18.320\nhigh of the spectrum.\n\n202\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and you might say,\n\n203\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.765\nat the very best, high-end CAD-based\nworkstations or 3D rendering.\n\n204\n00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:28.680\n&gt;&gt; Cuz what needs 128 gigs of RAM?\n\n205\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.950\nThat's a lot, it's not practical for\nmost home users.\n\n206\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.820\nIt would be way too cost prohibitive,\nand just unnecessary.\n\n207\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.100\n&gt;&gt; And honestly, at this point Dan,\nI'd be picking semantics on you,\n\n208\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.670\ncuz the boards essentially could\nrun server based platforms.\n\n209\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they could.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they have multiple\n\n210\n00:10:42.948 --> 00:10:43.770\nprocessors in them.\n\n211\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.630\nSo yeah,\nyou're just not really seeing that.\n\n212\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.081\nLet me show you,\nas we get into our operating systems,\n\n213\n00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:55.743\nwhere could I even see in Windows what\nthe current platform is that I have?\n\n214\n00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:57.973\nAll right,\nnow I actually have a Vista machine here.\n\n215\n00:10:57.973 --> 00:11:01.823\nAnd we're gonna show you some of\nthe different operating systems when it\n\n216\n00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:04.172\ncomes to the flavors of\nWindows if you will.\n\n217\n00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:06.339\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a trip down memory lane.\n\n218\n00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:07.356\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And start,\n\n219\n00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:10.930\nwell remember this Windows when you\nwere Vista and nobody liked you at all?\n\n220\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n221\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.582\nWe heard a lot of people say\nthat's the modern ME, right?\n\n222\n00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:17.289\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Windows Mistake Edition.\n\n223\n00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:21.100\nAnd the reason we're gonna show you\ndifferent editions of Windows or\n\n224\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.922\ndifferent flavors of Windows,\nis cuz they might ask you on the exam.\n\n225\n00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:27.280\nAnd yes we gonna get specific here.\n\n226\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.410\nSo when you see me throwing you these\npatterns on how to get to different\n\n227\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.865\nlocations, I want you to memorize them.\n\n228\n00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:37.844\nWe want you to memorize them here,\nbecause you might have a text-based answer\n\n229\n00:11:37.844 --> 00:11:40.570\nthat says, how do I see where the RAM is,\nthe amount?\n\n230\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.220\nOr how do I see the architecture in Vista?\n\n231\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.190\nAnd they're gonna want\nyou to know that yeah,\n\n232\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.990\nyou might be able to right-click on\nyour Start button and choose Properties.\n\n233\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.535\nOr, you might have to do\nsomething like the Start button,\n\n234\n00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:56.720\nright-click on Computer and\nchoose Properties, right?\n\n235\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.180\nThose might be two answers, but\nI want you to notice something.\n\n236\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.850\nIf I right-click on the Start menu,\nor Start button, excuse me.\n\n237\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:09.420\nAnd I choose Properties,\nI don't see where I need to be, right?\n\n238\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.050\nAnd I do that for for the purposes of\nshowing you that answers do matter,\n\n239\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.560\nobviously, to getting these questions\nright and they might be very,\n\n240\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.390\nvery specific.\n\n241\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.368\nBecause if you are gonna\nprove that you're a tech,\n\n242\n00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:21.538\nthey want to know have you\never pushed the Start button?\n\n243\n00:12:21.538 --> 00:12:26.453\nHave you ever right-clicked on Computer\nand brought up the system properties to\n\n244\n00:12:26.453 --> 00:12:31.453\nwhere you can zoom in and see that the\nsystem type is a 32-bit operating system.\n\n245\n00:12:31.453 --> 00:12:33.298\nSo you have to be specific.\n\n246\n00:12:33.298 --> 00:12:36.424\nBut you also have to know things like for\ninstance,\n\n247\n00:12:36.424 --> 00:12:41.075\nthat hey yeah I could right-click on\nComputer inside of the Start menu, but\n\n248\n00:12:41.075 --> 00:12:43.120\nguess what else I could do?\n\n249\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.810\nI could also go to Control Panel,\nI could go to System and\n\n250\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.160\nMaintenance, and I could choose System.\n\n251\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.480\nAnd I see the same screen, right?\n\n252\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.280\nNow again you might say well Wes,\nyou're really nitpicking here.\n\n253\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.780\nYes, I am, yes we are.\n\n254\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.030\nWe are doing that because they very well\ncould nitpick you on this exam as well.\n\n255\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.960\nSo understand that that is important.\n\n256\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.213\n&gt;&gt; It's very frustrating that they do\nthat, but you gotta be prepared for it.\n\n257\n00:13:09.213 --> 00:13:13.170\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nit is a frustration, right?\n\n258\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.950\nBecause again you have to understand\nthey want you to prove that you\n\n259\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.940\nhave somewhere around 6 to 12\nmonths of either lab experience or\n\n260\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.680\nhands on experience in the field.\n\n261\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.040\nIt's recommended but not required.\n\n262\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.270\nBut keep in mind the recommendations mean\nthat's what you're going to be expected,\n\n263\n00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:36.120\nthat's the information that you're gonna\nbe expected to know inside of this exam.\n\n264\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.990\nNow notice as I'm zooming in here and\nout here, right, System Properties,\n\n265\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.120\nagain I can see that the System type\nis a 32-bit operating system, right?\n\n266\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.870\nWell when I said 2 to the power of 32,\n\n267\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.650\nthat actually limits you to 4 gigs of RAM,\nI have 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n268\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.400\nNow also understand something too,\nwhen we talk about hardware, and\n\n269\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.640\nwhen we talk about Windows,\n\n270\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.710\nthat includes your shared memory, or\nI'm sorry, shared video RAM, right?\n\n271\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.800\nSo some people say, installed RAM.\n\n272\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.350\nI've got three gigs of installed RAM.\n\n273\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.150\nI could probably upgrade a little bit,\nmaybe put another gig in there.\n\n274\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.540\nBut that might not be the case,\n\n275\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.660\nbecause it also includes any kind of RAM\nthat you using shared for video as well.\n\n276\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.748\nSo do keep that in mind too.\n\n277\n00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:20.188\nNow I also want you to know\nthat if we were to sit here and\n\n278\n00:14:20.188 --> 00:14:23.490\nwe were to switch over to something\nlike our Windows 7 box here.\n\n279\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.173\nWell guess what?\n\n280\n00:14:24.173 --> 00:14:27.501\nI can push Start and\nnotice the similarities.\n\n281\n00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:30.331\nNow this is the good thing,\neven though they're nitpicking.\n\n282\n00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.181\nNotice that I push the Start button,\nI right-click Computer, and\n\n283\n00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:34.635\nthere's the Properties option.\n\n284\n00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:39.920\nAnd for the most part, it doesn't really\nchange how you get there and I love that.\n\n285\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.960\nAnytime you can memorize one path and\nit applies across two\n\n286\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.720\ndifferent operating systems, you're making\nit a little bit easier for yourself.\n\n287\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.250\nNow, notice here, all right,\nnotice something, right?\n\n288\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.170\nNotice that it says the system\ntype is a 64-bit operating system.\n\n289\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.150\nWhat might they throw you on the exam?\n\n290\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.193\nThey might throw you an exhibit that says,\n\n291\n00:14:59.193 --> 00:15:01.994\nwe've got the 4 gigs in\nthe 32-bit operating system.\n\n292\n00:15:01.994 --> 00:15:05.899\nWe've got the 64-bit, gi-, or\n64-bit operating system with 2 gigs.\n\n293\n00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.310\nHow can you improve the performance,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.230\nWell you can see here that if\nthe motherboard supports it,\n\n295\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.680\nI could bump up the RAM right?\n\n296\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.950\nAnd potentially get a better performance,\nright?\n\n297\n00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.720\nRemember what memory is, temporary\nworkbench for your working with your data.\n\n298\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.292\nThe bigger the workbench,\nthe more data, or\n\n299\n00:15:23.292 --> 00:15:25.830\nthe more work can be\ndone at a single time.\n\n300\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.870\nSo it is important.\n\n301\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.350\nNow that, and unfortunately,\nisn't the only place that we can go.\n\n302\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.560\nWe can also, believe it or not,\ngo to Windows Explorer, all right.\n\n303\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.590\nIf I launch up Windows Explorer,\nand notice that we\n\n304\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:43.950\nhave Computer here on the side of Windows\nExplorer in the folder hierarchy, right.\n\n305\n00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.170\nWell, notice this little Properties\noption right here as well.\n\n306\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.382\nWell guess what, six one half dozen or\nthe other, I'm at the same location.\n\n307\n00:15:51.382 --> 00:15:55.718\nAll right, and the great thing is\nif we bump over to Windows 8.1, and\n\n308\n00:15:55.718 --> 00:15:57.899\nI went ahead went with 8.1 here.\n\n309\n00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:00.660\n8's on the exam too, but they're so\n\n310\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.243\nsimilar there we went ahead and\nJust we're using 8.1 here.\n\n311\n00:16:05.243 --> 00:16:09.365\nAnd I honestly didn't have\na problem with Windows 8.1,\n\n312\n00:16:09.365 --> 00:16:12.990\nit really does kinda run\na very smaller footprint.\n\n313\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.790\nWell look here, understand that yes,\nI could so the same thing,\n\n314\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.970\nbut notice there's a little\nbit of a difference here.\n\n315\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.320\nIf I do a little hover to discover, let's\nsee if I can get that to come back up\n\n316\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.190\nnotice it says, File Explorer, well maybe.\n\n317\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.474\n&gt;&gt; Eventually.\n\n318\n00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:29.570\n&gt;&gt; Eventually it'll say [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n319\n00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.490\n&gt;&gt; Notice it says File Explorer,\nit doesn't say Windows Explorer.\n\n320\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.360\nWes you're really picking semantics.\n\n321\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.577\nAnswers count on the exam, all right?\n\n322\n00:16:36.577 --> 00:16:41.040\nSo in Windows 8.1 you wouldn't right click\nwhat is known as the task bar down here\n\n323\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.800\nand choose Windows Explorer,\nyou would choose File Explorer, right?\n\n324\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.740\nBut that same thing applies.\n\n325\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.320\nBut notice it no longer says\ncomputer here, it says, This PC.\n\n326\n00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.330\nAgain, we're getting a little bit\nmore specific, but we have to.\n\n327\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.800\nAnd if we right-click here,\nnotice that, if I scroll down so\n\n328\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.310\nyou guys can actually see it,\nI have a Properties option here as well.\n\n329\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:07.010\nNow the great thing is, the interface\ndoesn't really change much, right?\n\n330\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.282\nIt's gotta new coat of paint on it, right\nand Microsoft does that from time to time,\n\n331\n00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:14.411\nwhere though give a new coat of\npaint over an old technology and\n\n332\n00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:18.350\nrename it right completely, but\nit's essentially the same thing, right?\n\n333\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.240\nNow I've said that a lot in 901,\nbut now you\n\n334\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.520\ncan actually see it here in the software\nand the same thing applies, all right?\n\n335\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.750\nNow I know that we spend a lot of\ntime in just that one concept.\n\n336\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.910\nBut we want you to know\nthat there are multiple\n\n337\n00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.520\nways to get to the different\nfeatures in Windows.\n\n338\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.010\nSo, when Dan and\nI are explaining this throughout\n\n339\n00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:45.830\nthese features of Windows mini series\nprobably we're gonna end up having.\n\n340\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.880\nNote that there is more than one way And\nknow that you\n\n341\n00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.100\ncould be responsible on the a plus\nexam for those multiple paths, right?\n\n342\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.310\nAnd we say that because we\nwant you to be prepared.\n\n343\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.820\nWe want you to be successful.\n\n344\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.732\nWe don't want you to go in there and\nI'll hope I pass.\n\n345\n00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:05.060\nYou're gonna be nervous but we want you\nto knock it out of the ballpark, right?\n\n346\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.530\nWe want you to hit the out of the stadium,\nbreak somebody's window,\n\n347\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.320\nno just kidding, don't actually do that.\n\n348\n00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.730\nBut figuratively speaking, we want you to\nbe as prepared as you can for this exam.\n\n349\n00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.880\nSo as much I can, time permitted,\n\n350\n00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.310\nif there are multiple ways to get the\ndifferent locations, I'll mention them.\n\n351\n00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.433\nNow we might not demonstrate every one,\nbecause as you can see we've really spent\n\n352\n00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:30.074\n20 minutes just talking\nabout RAM architecture.\n\n353\n00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:32.745\nAnd how you could see that\nwithin the operating system and\n\n354\n00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:35.350\nthree different operating systems.\n\n355\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.615\nWe don't want our a plus 902 series\nhere to be 400 hours, right?\n\n356\n00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:44.270\nIt's not gonna benefit you and it's\ncertainly isn't gonna expedite about your\n\n357\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.640\ntraining, but you do have to\nknow that going out the gate.\n\n358\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.910\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n359\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.480\nwe're gonna move in to the next feature\nthat you see inside of Windows.\n\n360\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.865\nNow, moving out of XP, right?\n\n361\n00:18:55.865 --> 00:18:58.645\nAnd the good thing is xp,\ngreat operating system,\n\n362\n00:18:58.645 --> 00:19:02.805\nlost its shelf life or lifecycle as\nthey call it, I say shelf life, right?\n\n363\n00:19:02.805 --> 00:19:05.222\nIt expired back in 2014, right?\n\n364\n00:19:05.222 --> 00:19:09.015\nIt's 2017 at the time of this recording.\n\n365\n00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:13.730\nWell, when we moved away from XP and\ninto Vista,\n\n366\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.985\nVista brought a new\nflashy type of interface\n\n367\n00:19:17.985 --> 00:19:22.937\nsometing known as the Aero interface,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:19:22.937 --> 00:19:27.921\nNow the Aero interface was the one\nthat would have transparency,\n\n369\n00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:32.552\ntranslucency, and\ncould take advantage of 32 bit color.\n\n370\n00:19:32.552 --> 00:19:33.311\nAt which really,\n\n371\n00:19:33.311 --> 00:19:36.760\nif you look at it, 32 bit color, not too\nget back too much on the hardware side.\n\n372\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.770\n32 bit color, is actually 24 bit color\nwith what they call 8 alpha channels.\n\n373\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.250\nAnd the 8 alpha channels allow you to do\ntranslucencies and glossy effects as well.\n\n374\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.970\nBut Aero interface is a theme that you\ncould configure inside of Windows.\n\n375\n00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.560\nLet me go ahead and\n\n376\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.610\nshow you inside of Windows here where\nyou could get to the Aero theme.\n\n377\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.390\nNow, it's a little bit different inside\nof our virtual machines here, because of\n\n378\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.000\nthe fact that well, let me go ahead and\nbring up something like Windows Explorer.\n\n379\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.991\nIf you have the Aero interface on,\nyou can usually see these clear\n\n380\n00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:11.730\ntranslucencies around the outside\nof your Windows, right?\n\n381\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.355\nIt is something that works really well,\none of the ways that,\n\n382\n00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:17.700\nI might be able to show that to you.\n\n383\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.350\nSee, it's not working on this one.\n\n384\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.518\nIs one of the ways that you can\ndo it is just bring up a Windows.\n\n385\n00:20:23.518 --> 00:20:26.050\nAnd the Windows,\nif you can see transparent\n\n386\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.190\nif you will through to the desktop of any\nWindows that are open on your machine,\n\n387\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.680\nyou can see that you have\nthe Aero interface enabled.\n\n388\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.220\nSo inside of Windows Vista and Windows 7,\n\n389\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.450\nspecifically here in Windows 7, if I\nwas to right click here on the desktop,\n\n390\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.739\nwhat I would do is I would be\nable to go to personalize.\n\n391\n00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.820\nAnd then you can see the various Aero\nthemes that can be set here right.\n\n392\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.561\nYou have what we would see\nback in things like XP.\n\n393\n00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:55.940\nIf I scroll down you would see things\nlike the classic theme, right?\n\n394\n00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.600\nNotice the very basic theme and\n\n395\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.920\nWindows Basic itself doesn't give\nyou those transparencies, right?\n\n396\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.600\nBecause Aero- does have some requirements.\n\n397\n00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.950\nIf you're gonna support\nthe Aero interface,\n\n398\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:12.684\nthen you have to make sure that the system\nhas a minimum of a 1 gigahertz,\n\n399\n00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:16.820\n32-bit processor, or for\na 64--bit processor as well.\n\n400\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.740\nBut that's relatively low-end\nby today's market, if you will.\n\n401\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.440\nIt would have to have 1\nGigabyte of system memory,\n\n402\n00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.100\na graphics controller that had 128\nMegabytes of dedicated graphics memory.\n\n403\n00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.810\nIt also needs to support\nsomething known as the WWDM.\n\n404\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.184\nThat's the Windows Display Driver Module.\n\n405\n00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:41.190\nAnd that's one of the big changes from XP\nto Vista, and it continued in Windows 7.\n\n406\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.817\nIn the XP days,\nwe had what was known as the XPDM,\n\n407\n00:21:44.817 --> 00:21:48.281\nand that was the XP display or\nXP driver model.\n\n408\n00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:51.100\nAnd the problem was back in those\ndays those driver models and\n\n409\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.857\nDan I'm sure you're familiar with this\nworking in the industry, when you would\n\n410\n00:21:54.857 --> 00:21:58.961\ninstall a driver it would completely crash\nthe kernel it would cause problems, right?\n\n411\n00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:04.043\nThe driver video drivers in Windows could\ncause some serious problems in XP and\n\n412\n00:22:04.043 --> 00:22:06.739\nprior back in the Windows 2000 days.\n\n413\n00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:09.131\nSo when they moved into Vista and\nthen followed in Windows 7,\n\n414\n00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:11.810\nthey said all right we're gonna go\nwith the Windows display driver.\n\n415\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.620\nYeah, Display Driver Model, and\n\n416\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.440\nwhat that means is it keeps those\ndisplay's drivers out of the kernel mode.\n\n417\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.325\nThis is something you learn a lot\nmore inside of Linux and stuff.\n\n418\n00:22:22.325 --> 00:22:23.910\nUuser mode vs kernel mode.\n\n419\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.906\nSo essentially, if the driver would cause\nproblems it wouldn't blue screen and\n\n420\n00:22:27.906 --> 00:22:29.681\nrestart the whole entire machine.\n\n421\n00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:33.103\nYou might see it wig out a little bit\nin the user session, but it would\n\n422\n00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:37.210\nonly really affect the user itself more\nthan that would the low level the kernel.\n\n423\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.380\nSo understand the Windows\ndisplay driver model.\n\n424\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:47.180\nYou'll also, to support these Windows Aero\ninterfaces you would have to have\n\n425\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.530\nwhat is known as support for\npixel shader 2.0,\n\n426\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.230\nin the hardware,\nas well as 32 bit per pixel color.\n\n427\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.311\nAgain, they call it 32 bit color,\nbut it's kind of a misnomer,\n\n428\n00:22:58.311 --> 00:22:59.810\nit's actually 24 bit color.\n\n429\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.031\nAnd again, you have 8 extra bits for\nyour alpha channels-\n\n430\n00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:04.890\n&gt;&gt; But 32 sounds so much better.\n\n431\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.689\n&gt;&gt; That's right-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:06.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly,\n\n433\n00:23:06.378 --> 00:23:09.093\nI got 32 have to have more bits per-\n&gt;&gt; Thats how numbers work, right?\n\n434\n00:23:09.093 --> 00:23:10.746\nMore better, right?\n\n435\n00:23:10.746 --> 00:23:14.746\n&gt;&gt; And we talked about how a hardware,\nit's marketing tear but\n\n436\n00:23:14.746 --> 00:23:16.870\nI definitely worry about that.\n\n437\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.293\nSo that's a little bit about the Aero\ninterface again, I showed you how you can\n\n438\n00:23:21.293 --> 00:23:25.597\nright click on the desktop right, and\nyou could use Personalized, right?\n\n439\n00:23:25.597 --> 00:23:28.410\nYou can also do this in\ncontrol panel by push Start.\n\n440\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:33.180\nI go to control panel, notice that there's\nAppearance and Personalization right here.\n\n441\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.070\nI could do the same thing and\nwe could go to Personalization.\n\n442\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.580\nWe go to personalization and\nvoila, we're in the same location.\n\n443\n00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.650\nSo just another example of where you\n\n444\n00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.040\ncan use multiple ways to\nget to different things.\n\n445\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.670\nI will take a second here and show you\nthe difference in the control panels.\n\n446\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.890\nHere's another thing that they might\ncall semantics out on the exam.\n\n447\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:01.362\nNotice that the Control Panel says, for\ninstance, System and Security here.\n\n448\n00:24:01.362 --> 00:24:03.058\nThis is an exam tip, all right?\n\n449\n00:24:03.058 --> 00:24:05.299\nIf I can help you out with\nany kind of big exam tip,\n\n450\n00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:08.692\nI want you to notice that it's\ndifferent in Vista, and it's different,\n\n451\n00:24:08.692 --> 00:24:12.002\nI believe it's different in Windows 8.1,\ndon't quote me on that.\n\n452\n00:24:12.002 --> 00:24:15.972\nBut if I go to the Control Panel\ninside of Vista, this one I do know.\n\n453\n00:24:15.972 --> 00:24:18.084\nNotice it says System and Maintenance?\n\n454\n00:24:18.084 --> 00:24:22.590\nBut if I scroll over to the Control Panel\nin Windows 7, it says System and Security?\n\n455\n00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.501\nAgain, it's one of those\nthings where you're like,\n\n456\n00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:27.360\nman you guys are really picking\non some semantics here.\n\n457\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.520\nBut if they say in Windows 7, they say you\nneed to get to your system properties.\n\n458\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.543\nAnd they say, push Start,\npush Control Panel,\n\n459\n00:24:35.543 --> 00:24:40.286\ngo to System and Maintenance,\ngo to System, that's not the right answer.\n\n460\n00:24:40.286 --> 00:24:44.995\nThat's how you get there in Vista, not how\nyou get there in Windows 7, and I'll quit\n\n461\n00:24:44.995 --> 00:24:49.264\nwith the needing some motion sickness\npills here just to watch this episode.\n\n462\n00:24:49.264 --> 00:24:52.884\nSo again, do keep that in mind, all right?\n\n463\n00:24:52.884 --> 00:24:55.674\nAll right, so\nI know we're kind of coming up on time,\n\n464\n00:24:55.674 --> 00:24:58.841\none last thing that I'll kind\nof talk about here is gadgets.\n\n465\n00:24:58.841 --> 00:25:01.880\nAnd gadgets are an interesting\nfunctionality,\n\n466\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.332\nthese actually started in Windows 7.\n\n467\n00:25:04.332 --> 00:25:06.290\nAnd I'm gonna kind of lump these in here.\n\n468\n00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:09.470\nDan it's kind of interesting, this will\ncome up down in the objectives here but\n\n469\n00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.360\nthey really should be lumped together.\n\n470\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.347\nInside of Windows Vista, one of\nthe things that they introduced, and\n\n471\n00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:16.889\nif we could check out my screen here,\nI can kind of show you.\n\n472\n00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:20.091\nThey introduced what was known as, and\nmy head's kind of covering it up, but\n\n473\n00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:22.227\nwhat's known as the Windows Sidebar,\nall right?\n\n474\n00:25:22.227 --> 00:25:23.975\nAnd inside of the Windows Sidebar,\n\n475\n00:25:23.975 --> 00:25:27.189\nthey had these small mini\napplications called Gadgets, right?\n\n476\n00:25:27.189 --> 00:25:30.954\nAnd you would have the ability if you\nwanted to detach these from the sidebar\n\n477\n00:25:30.954 --> 00:25:34.860\nand essentially you could put these\nlittle gadgets where you wanted.\n\n478\n00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.910\nAnd then depending on which ones you have,\n\n479\n00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.220\nsometimes you could do some slight\nmodifications there, right?\n\n480\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.612\nI can name the clock, I could change it.\n\n481\n00:25:42.612 --> 00:25:45.747\nI wonder if they still have the neon one,\nyeah this is the one I loved and\n\n482\n00:25:45.747 --> 00:25:47.033\nshows the geek I am, right?\n\n483\n00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:48.781\nBut you could change it a little bit.\n\n484\n00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:53.500\nBut this sidebar, man, that thing\ncosts you a little bit of performance.\n\n485\n00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.640\nAnd in fact,\nI wonder if we could kind of see it?\n\n486\n00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.560\nLet me see if I can show you guys,\n\n487\n00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.320\nwhen I say it costs a little\nbit in your performance here.\n\n488\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.040\nYeah sidebar.\n\n489\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.869\nDan you see how much memory\n[LAUGH] that thing is using?\n\n490\n00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:09.851\nThat's a lot, right-\n&gt;&gt; Definitely one of the heavier hitters\n\n491\n00:26:09.851 --> 00:26:10.557\non the list.\n\n492\n00:26:10.557 --> 00:26:14.505\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely And what's\ninteresting is, I didn't need it either.\n\n493\n00:26:14.505 --> 00:26:15.560\nI can undock it.\n\n494\n00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.560\nSo in Windows 7, the sidebar is gone,\nand I want you to know that.\n\n495\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.883\nBut if I right-click on the desktop, let\nme clean this desktop up a little bit here\n\n496\n00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:27.214\nguys and gals out there, sorry about that.\n\n497\n00:26:27.214 --> 00:26:30.203\nNotice that I still have\nthe option to get to gadgets.\n\n498\n00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:33.910\nAnd well, there's my clock, right?\n\n499\n00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.260\nI still have access to the clock.\n\n500\n00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.680\nAnd I could do the exact same thing.\n\n501\n00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.499\nIs I mean, you notice,\nladies and gentlemen,\n\n502\n00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:42.280\nI'm gonna probably pick\nthe same clock here.\n\n503\n00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.408\n&gt;&gt; It's the first thing Wes does when\nhe gets a new Windows Operating System,\n\n504\n00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:46.859\nyou see this cool blue neon clock.\n\n505\n00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:47.501\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n506\n00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:48.038\n&gt;&gt; Fine tuning\n\n507\n00:26:48.038 --> 00:26:49.950\nthe operating system, right?\n\n508\n00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.680\nSo those are the gadgets, and\n\n509\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.740\nagain they're just kind of\nlike mini applications, but\n\n510\n00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.270\nI wanted to lump sidebar in here,\nbecause sidebar really came in in Vista.\n\n511\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:02.050\nYou see how much memory its running inside\nof Vista, its not running here at all,\n\n512\n00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.690\nit was discontinued.\n\n513\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.380\nSo we really don't have any gadgets,\nor we don't have any sidebar.\n\n514\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.970\nNow that being said, if we switch over\nto Windows 8.1 and I right-click.\n\n515\n00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.680\nNotice what's missing from the list?\n\n516\n00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.430\nWell, gadgets right?\n\n517\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.043\n&gt;&gt; Gadgets are gone.\n\n518\n00:27:19.043 --> 00:27:20.738\n&gt;&gt; And that's right and\nlet me show you why, right?\n\n519\n00:27:20.738 --> 00:27:25.931\nWe had what's known as the Modern UI,\nand we'll talk about that.\n\n520\n00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:28.332\nEverything's a gadget in Windows 8.1.\n\n521\n00:27:28.332 --> 00:27:31.427\nSo they were discontinued\nafter Window's 7 and\n\n522\n00:27:31.427 --> 00:27:34.075\nthey also posed some security risks too.\n\n523\n00:27:34.075 --> 00:27:37.647\nSo Microsoft made the wise choose of,\nhey, we're just gonna discontinue them,\n\n524\n00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:39.425\nwe don't need the added security risk.\n\n525\n00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:42.891\nBut do want you to know that there there,\nonce you know how to get to them, right?\n\n526\n00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:47.375\nAnd know the difference between the fact\nthat the sidebar is in Vista, but\n\n527\n00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:48.906\nit's not in Windows 7.\n\n528\n00:27:48.906 --> 00:27:53.427\nAnd then also know that Gadgets are in\nboth of those operating system versions,\n\n529\n00:27:53.427 --> 00:27:55.798\nbut they're not here in Windows 8.1.\n\n530\n00:27:55.798 --> 00:27:59.608\nAll right Dan, well it's kind of\ninteresting, I got through three?\n\n531\n00:27:59.608 --> 00:28:01.225\n[CROSSTALK] three topics, right?\n\n532\n00:28:01.225 --> 00:28:03.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we've got a lot more to go, but\n\n533\n00:28:03.535 --> 00:28:06.231\nDan's letting me know,\nI don't think we have enough time.\n\n534\n00:28:06.231 --> 00:28:09.518\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ntime is fleeting here in this episode, but\n\n535\n00:28:09.518 --> 00:28:14.684\nas we kind of expected that so we're\ngonna have multiple parts to this little,\n\n536\n00:28:14.684 --> 00:28:19.080\nlike you said miniseries getting\nus dived into or diving into.\n\n537\n00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.405\nI can't think of the right word.\n\n538\n00:28:20.405 --> 00:28:22.200\n[LAUGH] It's one of those things, right?\n\n539\n00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.780\nYou know what I mean.\n\n540\n00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.870\nInto the Windows Operating System.\n\n541\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.509\nWes, thanks for getting us this far.\n\n542\n00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:29.955\nWe look forward to\ncontinuing that journey.\n\n543\n00:28:29.955 --> 00:28:33.211\nBut as for this episode goes we're\nneeding to sign off for ITProTV,\n\n544\n00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.110\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n545\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brighton.\n\n546\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.760\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n547\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:44.427\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:28:44.427 --> 00:28:46.670\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro.\n\n",

00:00:17.065\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:19.205\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:22.295\nwell I hope you're as excited as I am,\nbecause it's going to be a lot of fun.\n\n9\n00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:25.911\nWe're continuing on in\nour A+ 220-902 series,\n\n10\n00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:30.580\ngetting that kicked off, and joining\nus back in the studio to continue our\n\n11\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.195\nconversation about Windows features\nis our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:37.230\nWes, we're glad to have you back,\nand how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.986\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great and why do\nyou say I'm excited to be here too and\n\n14\n00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:41.076\nmoving on with this train.\n\n15\n00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:45.006\nThat's right, we are going to\ncontinue along just like Dan said,\n\n16\n00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:49.075\nsome of the features that you could\nexpect to see inside of Windows and\n\n17\n00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:52.680\non the A+ exam as well,\nespecially, well the 902 exam.\n\n18\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.190\nWell, let's go ahead and let's kick\noff the excitement to basically start\n\n19\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.960\ntalking about something that brought a lot\nof excitement to admins everywhere and\n\n20\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.535\nusers within Windows when Vista came out.\n\n21\n00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:08.510\nYeah, that´s something called\nthe user account control.\n\n22\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.755\n&gt;&gt; It excited people on that.\n\n23\n00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:10.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely did.\n\n24\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.621\n&gt;&gt; They loved it.\n\n25\n00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:12.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n26\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.450\nit excited the blood pressure, brought\nthe cholesterol up a little bit, right?\n\n27\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.080\nWe're just kidding.\n\n28\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.950\n&gt;&gt; It was interesting, though, because\nit was a bit of a two-part excitement.\n\n29\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.740\nBad excitement on the user end, but\ngood excitement on the administrative end.\n\n30\n00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.700\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\n\n31\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.270\nwhat happened was we moved from\nXP's nonstandard user model, right?\n\n32\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.530\nLet's talk about XP.\n\n33\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.470\nXP wasn't following a lot of\nthe security architecture that\n\n34\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.570\nother operating systems have been\ndoing for a long time, right?\n\n35\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.940\nYou might have heard of root user before,\nin maybe the Unix based systems.\n\n36\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.140\nAnd if you haven't well let's\njust talk about it, right?\n\n37\n00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140\nRoot User, Inside of Linux, and Unix,\n\n38\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.900\nif you will,\nis the most privileged account, right?\n\n39\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.770\nIt's an account that you have\nto keep protected, right, why?\n\n40\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.700\nBecause the root user has privileged\naccess to some locations that could cause\n\n41\n00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.340\nvery, very bad problems if\nthe system is compromised, right?\n\n42\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Not only that, but\n\n43\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.340\nthe system will not stop the root user\nfrom doing anything that it wants to do.\n\n44\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay so yes.\n\n45\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.090\nSo if you're in root,\nyou do whatever you want, right?\n\n46\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.080\nWell, Windows dint really\nfollow this model in the fact\n\n47\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.260\nthat you know in the next base systems you\nhad to pseudo yourselves super user do.\n\n48\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.770\nYou had to elevate your privileges, right?\n\n49\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.640\nYou would run as a more of like\na standard user, a non root user, right?\n\n50\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.570\nWe call it in Windows,\nwe call it the administrative user.\n\n51\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.700\nWell, in the XP and prior days when you\nwould install the operating system, you\n\n52\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.070\nwould configure the first user, they would\nessentially be the administrator, right?\n\n53\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.680\nIt would be like you being\nthe root all the time.\n\n54\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.400\nWell the problem is when you\nwould install applications,\n\n55\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.840\nprograms, heck, a normal user\ncould even install drivers right?\n\n56\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.390\nThis could cause some very,\nvery bad problems with the stability of\n\n57\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.520\nthe operating system, and more\nimportantly, if you're, like Dan said,\n\n58\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.870\nthe administrative side,\nsecurity compromises.\n\n59\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.320\nSo when Vista came out, they said,\n\n60\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.070\nwe're going to start to follow some\nof the other architectures out there.\n\n61\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.880\nWe're going to come out with what's\nknown as SUA, they called it.\n\n62\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150\nStandard user architecture, right?\n\n63\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.200\nIt's just a fancy term for saying, hey,\nnow we're going to jump on board and\n\n64\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.690\ndo what some of the other operating\nsystems are going to do, and\n\n65\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.210\nwe're going to protect\nthe administrative account.\n\n66\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.370\nAgain, akin to what\nthe root user would be.\n\n67\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.956\nWe're going to protect the administrative\naccount, and we're going to run everybody,\n\n68\n00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:32.540\nincluding administrators,\nin what's known as a standard user model.\n\n69\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.670\nNow what does that mean?\n\n70\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.820\nThe standard user model mean we\nreduce your functionality, or\n\n71\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.660\nyour privilege level I should say,\ndown to a none administrative user and\n\n72\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.160\nwhy would they do that?\n\n73\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.500\nWell, you get a lot of feedback in these\noperating systems where you can send\n\n74\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.650\nfeedback in Microsoft.\n\n75\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.090\nThey analyze it, they do surveys,\nthey research the information.\n\n76\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.310\nAnd they found that most\nusers could do almost\n\n77\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.070\nevery bit of their day\nto day operations and\n\n78\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.090\ncomputing tasks without needing a single\nbit of administrative level privileges.\n\n79\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.380\nSo if you don't need those privileges,\nthen why should you be able to run them?\n\n80\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.920\nSo how did they enforce that?\n\n81\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.740\nWell, they enforced that\n\n82\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.580\nwith something known as\nthe User Account Control, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.910\nSo let's go ahead and break that down.\n\n84\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.390\nUser Account.\n\n85\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.360\nThere's two types of user accounts\nunder the standard user architecture.\n\n86\n00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.910\nThere's the Windows Administrator, right?\n\n87\n00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.540\nThat is kind of like a root user,\nthat's always been around in Windows.\n\n88\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.830\nBut now you have this new type of\naccount that's called a standard user.\n\n89\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.780\nIn your standard user,\nis a non-privileged account.\n\n90\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.200\nNow what do we mean by non-privileges?\n\n91\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.710\nCan't make core functionality changes,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.960\nCan't make core changes to\nthe operating system, cannot modify\n\n93\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.380\nessentially key security settings,\ncan't do writes to the registry, right?\n\n94\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.490\nRegistry is the database\nright inside of Windows.\n\n95\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.170\nReally holds all the configurations,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.800\nIn the XP days, if you would install\nan application as a Windows Administrator,\n\n97\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.740\nyou wouldn't even know it, it's making\nmodifications to the registry, and\n\n98\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.010\nif you would install a virus, guess what?\n\n99\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.140\nIt's also running in the context of\nyour administrative account, making its\n\n100\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.349\nmodifications behind the scenes to\nthe registry, causing all kinds of havoc.\n\n101\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.730\nSo insert the UAC.\n\n102\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.179\nNow the problem when we joke around about\nit from the user standpoint is every time\n\n103\n00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.318\nthe UAC triggers and says,\nwell, wait a second.\n\n104\n00:05:15.318 --> 00:05:18.957\nHold on, you're about to do something\nthat again, step back here,\n\n105\n00:05:18.957 --> 00:05:21.868\nis going to make a core change\nto the operating system.\n\n106\n00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:26.506\nWhether it's installing a driver or\nwhether it's modifying the registry,\n\n107\n00:05:26.506 --> 00:05:30.275\nmodifying a security setting,\ndid you do this?\n\n108\n00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:33.250\nBecause if you did and you're\nan administrator, we'll go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.450\nlet you press yes to continue.\n\n110\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.350\nIf you didn't, then you should press no\nand we'll protect the operating system,\n\n111\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.240\nand we'll protect the registry, and\nwe'll protect those security settings so\n\n112\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.620\nthat it doesn't make malicious changes.\n\n113\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.210\nNow if you're not a Windows administrator,\nwhat would happen?\n\n114\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.800\nWell you'd get\nan authentication dialog box\n\n115\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.210\njust like when you're\nlogging into the machine.\n\n116\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.880\nAnd what you would be\nrequired to do is login or\n\n117\n00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.569\nto elevate the user account control\nwith administrative level privileges.\n\n118\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.930\nAll right, now,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n119\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.840\nOn our Windows Vista machine, right,\n\n120\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.610\nif I was to do pretty much just\nabout any type of installation here.\n\n121\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.220\nI don't know if I still got this\ninstalled here, but let's see here.\n\n122\n00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.260\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nforce this thing to work.\n\n123\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.510\nHopefully we don't crash\nthe computer here.\n\n124\n00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.580\nAll right, notice that it's\ntelling me that it's saying,\n\n125\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.560\nhey, you want to install this software.\n\n126\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.471\nNow I want you to see what happens, right?\n\n127\n00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:35.382\nWhen I go to run this software what we\n\n128\n00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:39.340\nshould see is that it locks\nthe machine up on me.\n\n129\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.900\nNow hopefully it doesn't lock\nthe machine up on me and crash it here.\n\n130\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.356\nBut what we should see is that it's going\nto trigger something known as the user\n\n131\n00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:47.446\naccount control.\n\n132\n00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:51.060\nAnd I might be able to actually\njust go ahead and open this up.\n\n133\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.040\nNotice we have this little\nshield here where it says setup.\n\n134\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.920\nThat's a tell tale sign that\nthis is going to require\n\n135\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.140\nsome kind of administrative\nlevel privilege.\n\n136\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.050\nAnd that more specifically it should\ntrigger the user account control.\n\n137\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.690\nAnd here we can see it, right?\n\n138\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.420\nThis is your, another acronym here for\nyou A+ students out there, the UAC.\n\n139\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.920\nAnd it's letting me know that\nif I look at the details,\n\n140\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.930\nthat this software is about to run.\n\n141\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.914\nNow, since I'm an administrative user, I\ncould press Continue and I could run this,\n\n142\n00:07:21.914 --> 00:07:25.200\nnd I'm not going to,\nI'm going to press Cancel.\n\n143\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.590\nHowever, if I wasn't an administrator,\n\n144\n00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.860\nif my account wasn't recognized as\nan administrator and just a standard user,\n\n145\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.580\nI would get an authentication dialog box\nhere that would remind, will require me to\n\n146\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.090\ntype in an administrative user name and\nadministrator password.\n\n147\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.850\nAnd then it would continue the operation,\nall right?\n\n148\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.958\nNow, here's one of our things\nthat we joke around and\n\n149\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:52.600\nDan kind of joked around there that it\nwas really bugging a lot of users, right?\n\n150\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.240\nUsers they say hey, I just bought the\ncomputer and I can't do anything with it.\n\n151\n00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.157\nEvery time I go to do something,\nit's causing me this problem, right?\n\n152\n00:08:00.157 --> 00:08:03.007\nWell that's because when Vista came out,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:05.570\nlook at the user account control\nsettings by pushing Start.\n\n154\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.530\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel and\nthis is kinda interesting but\n\n155\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.440\nit's User Account and Family Safety.\n\n156\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.430\nAnd one of the great things\nis you're gonna see, and\n\n157\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.969\nwe'll bump over to Windows 7,\nit's the same thing in Windows 7.\n\n158\n00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.430\nAnd notice that I'm gonna\ngo to User Accounts.\n\n159\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.690\nAnd then if I scroll down\nhere we've got this option\n\n160\n00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.860\ncalled turn off the User Account Control\nor turn it on and off, right?\n\n161\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.860\nEverywhere I see a shield\nit's gonna require me to have\n\n162\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.830\nan administrative account in order to\nperform this function or prompt me\n\n163\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.050\nwith an authentication dialog box in which\nI'll have to enter those credentials.\n\n164\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.230\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay continue to this.\n\n165\n00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.920\nAll right, and\nI want you to notice that it says\n\n166\n00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.830\nuse the User Account Control\nto help protect your computer.\n\n167\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.940\nAnd I can turn it off.\n\n168\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.180\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.940\nNow I'm not gonna restart cuz I'm\nactually gonna cancel out of this, right?\n\n170\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.770\nLet me go ahead and what I'm gonna\ndo is we're gonna go back there, and\n\n171\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.640\nI am gonna turn this back on, all right.\n\n172\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.120\nWhy am I gonna turn this back on?\n\n173\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.670\nDan was just saying as the users,\n\n174\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.139\nwe're getting really offended and\nbugged by this.\n\n175\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.679\nIf you've ever disabled the user\naccount control, right,\n\n176\n00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:22.107\nbecause you got a little bit tired of\nall these prompts, it is more of a pain.\n\n177\n00:09:22.107 --> 00:09:27.003\nEspecially if you have to reinstall your\noperating system, reconfigure everything\n\n178\n00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:30.947\nfrom scratch, reinstall all\nthe applications and configure them,\n\n179\n00:09:30.947 --> 00:09:34.897\njust because you got bugged a little\nbit by the User Account Control.\n\n180\n00:09:34.897 --> 00:09:39.750\n&gt;&gt; What's so interesting was this came out\nof users backlash about the insecurity of\n\n181\n00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.660\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n182\n00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.760\nThey complained,\nmy system is very insecure.\n\n183\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.210\nRight?\nI'm getting viruses and malware and\n\n184\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.720\nall these things are happening and\nI don't know how it's occurring.\n\n185\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.800\nSo Microsoft, I hear my user,\nI want to help them with this.\n\n186\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.590\nWe'll create a security measure that\nwill stop those things from happening.\n\n187\n00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.350\nWhere you have to approve\nthings before they happen.\n\n188\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.980\nAnd so you get rid of this drive by\ndownloading and malware installation\n\n189\n00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.390\nbecause you're running as\na system privileged user, right?\n\n190\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.830\nSo UAC, here it comes.\n\n191\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.514\nSo what do they do?\nThey turn around and complain that they\n\n192\n00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:18.565\nhave to click on things and\nI give it permission and it was security.\n\n193\n00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.887\nYou gotta remember when\nit comes to security and\n\n194\n00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:23.395\nease of usability it's\na sliding scale all right?\n\n195\n00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:26.940\nIf you increase one, the other is\ngonna down so if it's high security,\n\n196\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.772\nyou're gonna have a low usability,\n\n197\n00:10:28.772 --> 00:10:32.340\npeople are gonna have a harder\ntime using the operating system.\n\n198\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.310\nBut if you have really easily used\noperating systems typically security\n\n199\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.020\nsuffers for that because it's trying\nto make every accommodation for\n\n200\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.900\nthe end user to be able\nto easily work with it.\n\n201\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.670\nSo it's a hard thing to find that middle\nground, which they continue to work on and\n\n202\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.120\ncontinue to try to do,\n\n203\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.325\nand they get closer to that goal every\nday to find that just right spot.\n\n204\n00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:54.725\nBut with Vista, it was a real hard sell.\n\n205\n00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:56.155\nI mean a lot of people didn't like it.\n\n206\n00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:59.155\n&gt;&gt; And I like that term that you say\nyou've put out there, drive by downloads.\n\n207\n00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:02.185\nBecause in the XP days,\nif you were an administrative user and\n\n208\n00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:03.095\nit happened, right.\n\n209\n00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:07.035\nYou hit a website that automatically\nstarted downloading software.\n\n210\n00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:07.975\nYou weren't aware of it.\n\n211\n00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:10.673\nAnd you wouldn't be aware of those\nregistry modifications that were happening\n\n212\n00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:11.915\nin the background.\n\n213\n00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:15.265\nNow I also want to expand a little\nbit more on what Dan's saying,\n\n214\n00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:18.040\nright, they were trying to do both, right?\n\n215\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.266\nThey were trying to find the balance.\n\n216\n00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:23.251\nCuz the problem is the User Account\nControl in Vista was so sensitive, if you\n\n217\n00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:27.318\nsneezed wrong, the User Account Control\nwould say, did you mean to do that?\n\n218\n00:11:27.318 --> 00:11:28.197\nIf you did, press continue to go on.\n\n219\n00:11:28.197 --> 00:11:29.670\n&gt;&gt; But you gotta start somewhere.\n\n220\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.498\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And they had to just figure well we're\n\n221\n00:11:31.498 --> 00:11:34.897\ngonna go with more security, the people\nwant security let's just give them that.\n\n222\n00:11:34.897 --> 00:11:35.535\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:11:35.535 --> 00:11:38.627\n&gt;&gt; So when windows 7 come out they\ndid a couple of things right?\n\n224\n00:11:38.627 --> 00:11:41.995\nIn fact let me show you here on a Windows\n7 box you're gonna notice that it's\n\n225\n00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:42.925\nthe same location right?\n\n226\n00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:47.125\nI'm just pressing Start on the task bar\ndown here on the desktop, control panel\n\n227\n00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:50.255\nand again thank goodness this is makes it\na little bit easier to remember right.\n\n228\n00:11:50.255 --> 00:11:52.880\nUser Accounts and\nFamily Safety, same thing.\n\n229\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.160\nThat we seen in Vista, and\nwe go to User accounts, and\n\n230\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.010\nnotice it says, Change User\nAccount Control settings, right?\n\n231\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.340\nAnd when I click on this,\nI want you to notice something.\n\n232\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.750\nThere's a sliding scale.\n\n233\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.370\nNow I also want you to notice something\nthat didn't happen here in Windows 7.\n\n234\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.927\nRight?\n\n235\n00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:15.487\nIn Windows Vista when I went ahead and\nif you if you remember I went to\n\n236\n00:12:15.487 --> 00:12:20.386\nchange that right let's get on\nthe right side of the river there Wes.\n\n237\n00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:24.346\nStart and Control Panel, User Accounts and\n\n238\n00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:29.385\nFamily Safety, User Accounts and\nturn this on and off.\n\n239\n00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:34.000\nNotice that the User Account Control it's\nfiring off and saying you want to do this?\n\n240\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.480\nBut notice Windows 7 didn't do that.\n\n241\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.890\nHere's one of the things that\nthey did kinda listen, right?\n\n242\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.834\nDan's talking about start somewhere,\nhave a baseline, we'll kind of peek and\n\n243\n00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:44.280\ntweak it later and try to give you\na little bit better of a balance.\n\n244\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.110\nFirst of all, they said well in\nWindows 7 our architecture will\n\n245\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.960\nlessen some of the requirements that\nwe see so we won't be so intrusive.\n\n246\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.180\nRight, and\nthat's why it is less intrusive.\n\n247\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.610\nNotice that it says, Default- Notify me\n\n248\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.550\nonly when computer programs try\nto make changes to my computer.\n\n249\n00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.660\nI'm an administrator here, all right?\n\n250\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.110\nIt knows that I'm an administrator and\nI haven't modified any settings yet.\n\n251\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.050\nRight?\nSo it's not giving me a hard time.\n\n252\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.254\nIn the days of Vista,\nthis would have been it, right?\n\n253\n00:13:19.254 --> 00:13:20.518\nAnd then rip the slider bar off, right?\n\n254\n00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:24.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Always notify me, all right.\n\n255\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.710\nNow you can modify this and\n\n256\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.589\nI wanna talk really briefly about this\ndo not dim my desktop, all right.\n\n257\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.315\nThat functionality is built into\nthe User Account Control and it doesn't\n\n258\n00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:39.620\nmatter which version of the operating\nsystem or edition you have, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.120\nWhy?\n\n260\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.260\nWhy do they dim the desktop?\n\n261\n00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.585\nThat's called secure desktop and\nwhat that does is it puts your computer in\n\n262\n00:13:45.585 --> 00:13:48.766\nan instant safe mode and protects\n[SOUND] the registry and locks it down.\n\n263\n00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:53.200\nAnd the only thing you can interact\nwith on top of the secure desktop is\n\n264\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.030\nthe User Account Control.\n\n265\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.740\nJust like what's happening here.\n\n266\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.160\nNotice that in the background,\nI can't interact with anything.\n\n267\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.407\nAnd why is this a good thing?\n\n268\n00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:06.295\nWell if I don't dim the desktop, what's to\ntell me that this isn't some kind of third\n\n269\n00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:08.893\nparty software that's placing\na pop-up in my desktop?\n\n270\n00:14:08.893 --> 00:14:13.284\nAnd when it says put in your username and\npassword to elevate your privileges,\n\n271\n00:14:13.284 --> 00:14:15.556\nit's actually some kind of key logger.\n\n272\n00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:16.911\nAnd it sends it out over\na network connection,\n\n273\n00:14:16.911 --> 00:14:18.915\nit says now I've got your username and\npassword I can [CROSSTALK]\n\n274\n00:14:18.915 --> 00:14:19.842\n&gt;&gt; Those rascals.\n\n275\n00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:20.435\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n276\n00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:23.678\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's what you have to be careful.\n\n277\n00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:27.348\nDo not dim the desktop, essentially is\nturning off the functionality that 's\n\n278\n00:14:27.348 --> 00:14:29.305\nknown as secure desktop, so be careful.\n\n279\n00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:32.470\n&gt;&gt; Plus just a nice visual cue that\nsomething is actually happening, right?\n\n280\n00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.070\nThat I need to interact with this box.\n\n281\n00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.885\nSo if you were,\nmaybe perusing the Internet, and\n\n282\n00:14:37.885 --> 00:14:41.840\nall of a sudden your desktop dimmed,\nyou would think something is happening.\n\n283\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.430\nIt´s kind of giving you that\nagain that visual cue that\n\n284\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.040\nyour system is trying to do something.\n\n285\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.860\nAnd if you´re not actively trying to do\nsomething to your system to install or\n\n286\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.550\nmake a system change,\nthen that should be a warning for\n\n287\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.970\nyou that hey something is\ngoing on [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n288\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.898\nin the background that I\nneeded to pay attention to.\n\n289\n00:15:00.898 --> 00:15:01.700\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n290\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.580\nSo what's the first\npart of accountability?\n\n291\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.102\nAwareness.\n\n292\n00:15:04.102 --> 00:15:07.458\nAnd [LAUGH] you're going to be\naware if you can't do anything else\n\n293\n00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:08.648\non the desktop right?\n\n294\n00:15:08.648 --> 00:15:11.043\nAnd it helps to kinda hold these, not so\n\n295\n00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:13.061\nmuch you being accountable-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:15.010\n&gt;&gt; But\nhold the application accountable for\n\n297\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.700\nany modifications that it's gonna try and\nmake to your computer, all right?\n\n298\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.150\nSo that's a little bit about your UAC,\nas it's sometimes called,\n\n299\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.120\nUser Account Control.\n\n300\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.450\nNotice it started in Vista and\n\n301\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.070\nwe have it in every edition of\nWindows after the fact, right?\n\n302\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.650\nI do not recommend in any\nway turning that off,\n\n303\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.030\nbecause yes I understand ladies and\ngentlemen that it can be a pain.\n\n304\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.260\nWhen you're like, I know what I wanna do.\n\n305\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.220\nBut when you start to get\ninto the tech field, and\n\n306\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.920\nyou have seven computers on your desk or\nyour tech bench,\n\n307\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.500\nthat all have to have malware run,\nand they've got terabyte drives.\n\n308\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.955\nAnd you just spent seven hours on a single\nmachine running a malware scan through it\n\n309\n00:15:51.955 --> 00:15:56.232\none time, only to learn that you have\nto restore the entire operating system.\n\n310\n00:15:56.232 --> 00:15:58.595\nYou'll start thinking twice\nabout that user account control.\n\n311\n00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:02.483\nAnd again it is something that\nI really agree with Windows,\n\n312\n00:16:02.483 --> 00:16:07.475\nand I'm glad that they have introduced\nit and it's been around for a while.\n\n313\n00:16:07.475 --> 00:16:10.940\nAll right, so moving on to the next thing,\nwhich is also kind of security,\n\n314\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.590\nis something known as BitLocker.\n\n315\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.728\nAll right, BitLocker was something\nthat was introduced in Windows Vista.\n\n316\n00:16:15.728 --> 00:16:17.630\nContinued in Windows 7,\nwe still have it today, and\n\n317\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.690\nunderstand that it's gone\nthrough some major revisions.\n\n318\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.960\nNow, I don't think,\nin being in a non-Windows exam,\n\n319\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.590\nthat they're gonna get so\ncrazy on the specifics, okay?\n\n320\n00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.740\nLet's go ahead and show you a little\nbit about what I'm talking about.\n\n321\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.760\nSo if I was to, let's say,\ngo to this machine, and I was going,\n\n322\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.280\nI'll just go ahead and\nfire up Windows Explorer, all right?\n\n323\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.670\nAnd then I go over here to Computer.\n\n324\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.570\nNotice that if I right\nclick on my hard drive,\n\n325\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.400\nI have a potential to turn on BitLocker.\n\n326\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.430\nAll right, BitLocker is what's known\nas a drive encryption technology.\n\n327\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:56.590\nAnd what it does, is it prevents\nyour data from being compromised\n\n328\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.690\nthrough off line attacks, okay.\n\n329\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.630\nI say that, prefaced, because some people\nsay well BitLocker I can get around that.\n\n330\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.030\nWell, if you're logged into the machine,\nyou bet.\n\n331\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.120\nBitLocker was never meant to protect\nyour computer by encrypting or\n\n332\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.366\nscrambling the information,\nwhile the computer is online, right?\n\n333\n00:17:15.366 --> 00:17:19.311\nIt is to prevent somebody from taking\nthe hard drive out of your machine,\n\n334\n00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:20.928\nslaving it into another one,\n\n335\n00:17:20.928 --> 00:17:25.630\nor essentially connecting it to another\nmachine, and reading that information.\n\n336\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.580\nIt's an offline attack.\n\n337\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.680\nIf I'm logged into the machine,\nguess what, the functionality that secures\n\n338\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.890\nBitLocker is stored in RAM and\npeople that are in the know\n\n339\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.250\ncan pull that information right out of\nRAM and it doesn't do you any benefit.\n\n340\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.720\nIt's not what BitLocker was for.\n\n341\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.180\n&gt;&gt; We see this mostly with mobile devices,\nright?\n\n342\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.490\nLaptops, and things of that nature,\nsurface tablets,\n\n343\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.480\nvery very helpful there because\nwhat happens, you have your tablet,\n\n344\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.170\nyou have your laptop, you're sitting\nin the cafe, then someone runs by and\n\n345\n00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.700\nsnatches your computer,\ncloses the lid, and runs off with it.\n\n346\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.430\nWell, you know, it's gonna lock.\n\n347\n00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.110\nOr you walked away and\nsomeone picked it up and stole it.\n\n348\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.240\nWe see this with our government a lot.\n\n349\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.640\nThey happen to leave\nlaptops in a cab somewhere.\n\n350\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.530\nNo what do we do?\n\n351\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.390\nWell, good thing is they're\nprobably not logged in.\n\n352\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.732\nSo anybody that grabs that drive,\n\n353\n00:18:06.732 --> 00:18:09.335\nthey're not gonna be able to log\nin using a user name and password.\n\n354\n00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:10.382\nThey don't know that.\n\n355\n00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.400\nThey could try to brute force.\n\n356\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.040\nIt could take forever.\n\n357\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.000\nWho knows?\n\n358\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.280\nBut if they, like Wes said,\ntake that drive out.\n\n359\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.110\nI'll just slave this drive.\n\n360\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.200\nWell, it's completely encrypted.\n\n361\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.790\nYou'd have to have the decryption key,\nwhich they don't have.\n\n362\n00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.420\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and that's what it does,\nt does full drive encryption.\n\n363\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.850\nSo there are some of the specifics\nthat I want you be aware of BitLocker.\n\n364\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.610\nFirst of all, know where to turn it on.\n\n365\n00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.350\nNow, I just showed you, you can open\nFile Explorer, Windows Explorer,\n\n366\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.670\ndepending on which\noperating system you're in.\n\n367\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.380\nSelect the drive, and then you could\nright-click and turn on BitLocker.\n\n368\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.460\nUnderstand that you can also get to\nit by pushing Start &gt; Control Panel,\n\n369\n00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.970\nremember System and Security, all right?\n\n370\n00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.930\nAnd then we have down here at the bottom,\nwe have BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n371\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:54.890\nAnd be able to identify\nthis type of interface.\n\n372\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.640\nNow I do wanna make mention of\nsomething that is the requirements.\n\n373\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.690\nNow you'll notice that there's this term\ndown here that says TPM Administration.\n\n374\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.150\nI'm not so much worried about the\nadministration part for the APLS level.\n\n375\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.710\nIf you're gonna go on and you're gonna\ngo do like Windows client exams,\n\n376\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.260\nyou're gonna have to know\na little bit more about this.\n\n377\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.660\nBut I wanna talk about\nthis term right here, TPM.\n\n378\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.160\nThat is a requirement of BitLocker.\n\n379\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.820\nBitLocker requires what's known\nas a Trusted Platform Module.\n\n380\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:21.560\nA Trusted Platform Module is\na fancy way of saying a processor\n\n381\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.410\nchip that's on the motherboard that\nholds security information, all right.\n\n382\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.640\nThat's what a TPM is,\nTrusted Platform Module.\n\n383\n00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.530\nI want you to know what the acronym is,\nand I want you to know what it does.\n\n384\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.210\nThey call it a cryptographic processor.\n\n385\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.880\nIt's essentially a chip that sits on the\nmotherboard, stores security information.\n\n386\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.150\nNow when BitLocker is initialized\nit looks for that TPM.\n\n387\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.720\nAnd that's the other thing.\n\n388\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.040\nWe've been talking about taking the drive\nout, putting it in another device.\n\n389\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.230\nWell, when BitLocker goes to initiate and\n\n390\n00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.030\nit's an encrypted drive it's gonna\nlook for that hardware based chip.\n\n391\n00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.950\nAnd guess what?\n\n392\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.710\nIf it doesn't find it and\nit can't communicate through a BIOS\n\n393\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:04.650\nthat's TPM enabled, it says,\nthis isn't the same system I was in and\n\n394\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.760\ninstantly gets thrown into\nwhat's known as recovery mode.\n\n395\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760\nAnd now,\n\n396\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.880\nthe recovery mode requires a 48 character\npassword to be able to get in to.\n\n397\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.610\nI mean it really goes in lockdown.\n\n398\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.760\nSo here's some of the specifics I\nwant you to know about the TPM right?\n\n399\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:26.190\nTrusted Platform Module has to be\nTPM version 1.2 atleast, alright.\n\n400\n00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.970\nThe BIOS itself has to be compliant with\nthe TPM that's over seen by a company or\n\n401\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:35.110\na consortium called TCG,\nit's the Trusted Computing Group.\n\n402\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.445\nThe other ones that make the standard for\nTPMs, cuz TPMs understand aren't just used\n\n403\n00:20:39.445 --> 00:20:42.850\nfor BitLocker,\nthey're used all kinds of things, right.\n\n404\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.480\nAll kinds of security related\ntechnologies and computing.\n\n405\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.270\nThe trusted computing group is\nthe one that overseas that.\n\n406\n00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:54.260\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that\nthe BIOS itself, or UEFI based system,\n\n407\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:21:00.890\nmust support USB mass\nstorage class devices.\n\n408\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:06.610\nWhy, because when you configure\nBitLocker I can put your bit locker key on\n\n409\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.390\nthe USB device and I can walk over to the\nsystem that's been unable would BitLocker.\n\n410\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:16.380\nPlug the USB device in, and then require\nyou a PIN to unlock the drive, right?\n\n411\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.230\nWe call that two factor authentication,\n\n412\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.820\nwhich we'll talk about in\nthe security coming up.\n\n413\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.540\nBut you understand that.\n\n414\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.770\nYou also have to have two drives\nthat are formatted with NTFS,\n\n415\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.500\nwe'll talk about the file\nsystems coming up here soon.\n\n416\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.680\nAll right, so\ntwo drives must be NTFS-supported.\n\n417\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:39.790\nThe system drive has to\nbe at least 1.5 gigabyte.\n\n418\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:44.305\nSo just some small little details\nabout it that I want you to\n\n419\n00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:47.390\nknow because essentially that's\nthe requirement to having BitLocker.\n\n420\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.200\nFor now, understand that BitLocker is\na drive encryption technology that\n\n421\n00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.050\nhelps us secure our machines.\n\n422\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.390\nNow, some of the other\nthings they talk about,\n\n423\n00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.350\nthey talk about something\nknown as Shadow Copy,\n\n424\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.560\nShadow Copy is on your exam as well,\nall right?\n\n425\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.270\nNow, Shadow Copy has a few\ndifferent names out there.\n\n426\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.790\nShadow Copy is what they call it out on\nthe objectives, but it's also called VSS,\n\n427\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.350\nVolume Shadow Copy.\n\n428\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.430\nSometimes it´s called\nVolume Shadow Copy Service.\n\n429\n00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.900\nAll right, so\nwhat is volume shadow copy service?\n\n430\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.802\nAnd in fact, if we look at our Windows\n7 machine here, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n431\n00:22:19.802 --> 00:22:23.580\nwhat I'll do is I'll type in\nto the little search field.\n\n432\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.020\nWe´ll find the service.\n\n433\n00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.530\nI´m gonna type services.\n\n434\n00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.470\nIf I can spell services.msc, that'll\n\n435\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.970\nlaunch up the Services Microsoft\nManagement Console, all right.\n\n436\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.380\nAnd if we kinda get a zoom in here,\n\n437\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.550\nI'm gonna do an alphabetical\nsorting here of services.\n\n438\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:50.100\nServices are background processes that\nI don't necessarily launch myself.\n\n439\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.560\nUnlike an application that\nyou're using on your desktop,\n\n440\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.580\nwhich typically requires the user to\nstart it up so you can work with it.\n\n441\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.410\nBut you'll notice here that we have,\nsomewhere on the list.\n\n442\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.811\nYeah, the first one on the list,\nthat makes it easy.\n\n443\n00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:04.093\n[LAUGH] Notice we have volume shadow copy.\n\n444\n00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:05.661\nNow what is volume shadow copy?\n\n445\n00:23:05.661 --> 00:23:11.010\nAlright, volume shadow copy is typically\nused by the Windows backup system,\n\n446\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.850\nright, to backup your\nimportant information.\n\n447\n00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.160\nTo keep a copy and archive it if you will.\n\n448\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.010\nIt's also used by another concept that\nis actually in the list here Dan.\n\n449\n00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:24.070\nSo I'll include it right here with\nShadow Copy as system restore.\n\n450\n00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:29.036\nSystem Restore is a utility that\nallows you to essentially keep point\n\n451\n00:23:29.036 --> 00:23:33.757\nin time snapshots of the configuration\ndata within the machine.\n\n452\n00:23:33.757 --> 00:23:37.910\nNow there's a reason I stress\nconfiguration data, right?\n\n453\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:43.267\nBecause a Windows backup will\narchive not only configuration data,\n\n454\n00:23:43.267 --> 00:23:46.694\nbut it can also back up the user files,\ntoo.\n\n455\n00:23:46.694 --> 00:23:49.790\nSystem Restore isn't meant for user files.\n\n456\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.445\nIt is meant to keep configuration data.\n\n457\n00:23:53.445 --> 00:23:57.126\nSo to give you a situation where\nVolume Shadow Copy service, and\n\n458\n00:23:57.126 --> 00:23:59.730\nSystem Restore would come in handy.\n\n459\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.946\nI'm gonna install a new driver\ninside of my operating system.\n\n460\n00:24:02.946 --> 00:24:06.604\nWell, this service right here,\nif I got System Restore turned on,\n\n461\n00:24:06.604 --> 00:24:10.006\nwhich we'll look at coming up here next,\nwe'll make sure that\n\n462\n00:24:10.006 --> 00:24:14.400\nbefore I install that driver,\nit takes all the configuration data.\n\n463\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.220\nVolume Shadow Copy puts this file,\nor this hard drive,\n\n464\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.660\nin a read only state,\nmakes a copy of it, and archives it.\n\n465\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.452\nSo now I install a driver,\nthe driver causes a problem.\n\n466\n00:24:25.452 --> 00:24:30.301\nI can use that archived copy that System\nRestore made, called a restore point, and\n\n467\n00:24:30.301 --> 00:24:35.008\nI can restore it back to an earlier point\nin time, helping to repair the problem,\n\n468\n00:24:35.008 --> 00:24:37.340\nif the driver causes an issue.\n\n469\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.990\nWell, Volume Shadow Copy service is\nsomething that allows me to do that.\n\n470\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.850\n&gt;&gt; I love Volume Shadow Copy service, man.\n\n471\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.370\nWhen I found out about this is I\ngot into the field, as it were, and\n\n472\n00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.172\npeople would call you in a panic.\n\n473\n00:24:48.172 --> 00:24:53.141\nGoing no, I deleted this whole entire\nfolder, and I need all those files,\n\n474\n00:24:53.141 --> 00:24:58.053\nI'm ready to commit harakiri because\nI gotta have this for a presentation.\n\n475\n00:24:58.053 --> 00:25:00.160\nLet me check the Volume Shadow Copy.\n\n476\n00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.840\nLook, there it is right there.\n\n477\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.530\nAnd it's restored, enjoy.\n\n478\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.000\nAnd of course,\nalso the System Restore point.\n\n479\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.906\nLearn how to use it, learn to love it,\n\n480\n00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:11.475\nbecause it can bring\ncomputers back from the dead.\n\n481\n00:25:11.475 --> 00:25:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It is awesome.\n\n482\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.013\n&gt;&gt; And let me go ahead and\n\n483\n00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:18.925\nI did say that, cuz you're talking\nabout bringing files back, too.\n\n484\n00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:22.955\nIn Windows 8 and 8.1, they brought\nin what's known as File History.\n\n485\n00:25:22.955 --> 00:25:24.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And File History works kind of\n\n486\n00:25:24.835 --> 00:25:27.146\nlike System Restore does for your files.\n\n487\n00:25:27.146 --> 00:25:27.880\n&gt;&gt; For your files.\n\n488\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right, so the Volume Shadow Copy\nservice, I do wanna kind of relate that to\n\n489\n00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:36.226\nWindows 8 and 8.1, cuz they brought in\nthe new technology called file history.\n\n490\n00:25:36.226 --> 00:25:39.670\nAnd file history will keep\nthese previous versions\n\n491\n00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.286\nof your files at certain\npoints through out the time.\n\n492\n00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:45.070\nYou can schedule it to run.\n\n493\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.780\nSo that if you make changes, you delete\na file, you can, in file history,\n\n494\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.700\nyou can restore it.\n\n495\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.731\nPrior to file history being released,\nthey would call it previous versions.\n\n496\n00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:58.813\nLike Dan was kind of alluding there to,\nthat you could bring,\n\n497\n00:25:58.813 --> 00:26:02.268\nif you made unnecessary\nmodifications to a file, or\n\n498\n00:26:02.268 --> 00:26:05.789\nyou happened to delete half\nof a file you're like.\n\n499\n00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:07.935\nMy gosh this project is due at noon, and\n\n500\n00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:12.634\nI made a change to it at 11 o'clock that\ncorrupted it, or now I'm having problems.\n\n501\n00:26:12.634 --> 00:26:15.608\nYou can go back and\nstep back earlier in a point in time.\n\n502\n00:26:15.608 --> 00:26:20.165\nSo keep that in mind, the Windows backup\nsubsystem uses this to essentially\n\n503\n00:26:20.165 --> 00:26:24.290\nput the file system in a read only state,\nso it can make a copy of it, so\n\n504\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.900\nno changes are made while\nit's trying to make its copy.\n\n505\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.310\nSystem Restore uses it.\n\n506\n00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.780\nPrevious versions use it.\n\n507\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.100\nAnd the newer technology called\nFile History uses it as well.\n\n508\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.665\nNow, I mentioned System Restore.\n\n509\n00:26:35.665 --> 00:26:36.621\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n510\n00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:40.100\nlet's go ahead and dive in here, and we\nhaven't really done much in Windows 8.1.\n\n511\n00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.660\nLet's go and show you the Windows\n8.1 interface here, and\n\n512\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.250\nwe're gonna get to the desktop here.\n\n513\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.870\nAnd we will get to our System Restore.\n\n514\n00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.454\nFew different ways that you can do\nthis here inside of Windows 8.1,\n\n515\n00:26:50.454 --> 00:26:54.359\nkeep in mind that the start button will\nwork in Vista, as well as Windows 7.\n\n516\n00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:58.690\nWe have a start tile, if you will,\nin the Windows 8.1 interface, and\n\n517\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.036\nI could right-click on this and\nI could choose System.\n\n518\n00:27:02.036 --> 00:27:05.432\nAnd this is a kit in the system properties\nthat we've see here, so I won't bore\n\n519\n00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:08.622\nyou guys by going back, and showing\nyou how to get the System Properties,\n\n520\n00:27:08.622 --> 00:27:12.200\nwhere we were looking at what the\narchitecture was to the operating system.\n\n521\n00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:18.110\nYou can also get to the same location here\nin Windows 8.1, just by typing in Control,\n\n522\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:22.250\nand notice that you have this search\nfunctionality and Control Panel comes up.\n\n523\n00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.230\nSame thing works here as well, ladies and\ngentlemen, and I go to System and\n\n524\n00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.480\nSecurity.\n\n525\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.410\nThen we can go to System, and\nlike you'll see, essentially these\n\n526\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.230\nare the same system properties\nthat you were looking at earlier.\n\n527\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.400\nNow I want you to notice that if I\nlook over here on the right hand side,\n\n528\n00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.730\na lot of excuse me, left hand side,\n\n529\n00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.960\nI will see that there are a lot of\nthese what are known as task links.\n\n530\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.780\nAnd they're kinda like a hyper link\nthat takes you to a different location\n\n531\n00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.480\nwithin the operating system.\n\n532\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.690\nAnd what we want are advanced\nsystem settings, right?\n\n533\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.000\nAnd if we look at advanced system\nresettings, you're gonna see what we've\n\n534\n00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.410\ngot all these different types of tabs here\nacross the top within System Properties.\n\n535\n00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.620\nI will tell you just to\nkinda do this again.\n\n536\n00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:10.180\nNotice that these jump links,\nif I go to Remote settings,\n\n537\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.640\nwe'll notice here it's just taking me to\nthe same location, but in a different tab.\n\n538\n00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.260\nAnd the one that I really wanna\nlook at is System protection.\n\n539\n00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.760\nThis is where System Restore actually is.\n\n540\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.860\nAnd if I go to System Protection,\nyou'll notice that we have System Restore.\n\n541\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.540\nSystem Restore, right there.\n\n542\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:32.650\nAnd if I was to press System Restore,\nit'll start the system restore process.\n\n543\n00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:37.750\nNow, understand that System Restore\nworks on restore points.\n\n544\n00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.520\nKeep in mind that if you don't\nhave any restore points created,\n\n545\n00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.517\nthen you're not gonna be\nable to use this technology.\n\n546\n00:28:45.517 --> 00:28:46.310\n&gt;&gt; So that makes sense.\n\n547\n00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.943\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let me go ahead and\n\n548\n00:28:47.943 --> 00:28:51.389\nshut this down, and show you where\nyou can create a restore point.\n\n549\n00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:56.346\nIf you notice right here,\nit talks about Configure restore settings,\n\n550\n00:28:56.346 --> 00:28:57.760\nManage disk space.\n\n551\n00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.370\nLet me go ahead and\njust real quick show you something.\n\n552\n00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.150\nNotice, I need to configure\nSystem Protection.\n\n553\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:08.480\nIf, for any reason, you see this disabled,\nSystem Restore does not work.\n\n554\n00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.200\nIf I was to disable this,\nit deletes all restore points.\n\n555\n00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.009\nSo that's a little example\n&gt;&gt; That's sweet of them.\n\n556\n00:29:14.009 --> 00:29:16.503\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly,\nto keep in mind on the exam.\n\n557\n00:29:16.503 --> 00:29:18.922\nSo if for any reason this is disabled,\n\n558\n00:29:18.922 --> 00:29:23.240\nthe following steps that I'm gonna\nshow you will not work, right.\n\n559\n00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.520\nAnd it's kinda easy to tell right away,\nis when you look at the available drives,\n\n560\n00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.520\nif it says off, that's easy enough.\n\n561\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.920\nJust come in, configure it.\n\n562\n00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.839\nSelect the appropriate drive,\nconfigure, then turn it back on.\n\n563\n00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:38.520\nAnd then, once that's done,\nyou can create a System Restore point.\n\n564\n00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.580\nAnd we can do that,\ncreate a restore point.\n\n565\n00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:47.940\nWe'll just call this, I'm not too creative\nhere today, let's call this 22902 Demo.\n\n566\n00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.550\nAnd we'll choose Create.\n\n567\n00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.950\nNow, understand that's a manually\ncreated restore point.\n\n568\n00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.014\nThere are a couple of things that\ntrigger automatic restore points.\n\n569\n00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:57.107\nWhen you first install\nyour operating system,\n\n570\n00:29:57.107 --> 00:30:00.520\nyou have what's called an initial system\ncheckpoint, I think they call it.\n\n571\n00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.061\nAt certain points throughout the day,\nif you leave your operating system on for\n\n572\n00:30:05.061 --> 00:30:06.775\n24 hours, it creates one.\n\n573\n00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:08.416\nIf you install an application,\n\n574\n00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:12.930\nit creates one, so that if the application\nbecomes problematic, you can roll it back.\n\n575\n00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.963\nIf, what else?\n\n576\n00:30:14.963 --> 00:30:19.717\nInstalling drivers will create\na System Restore point.\n\n577\n00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.914\nAnd this is taking a bit here,\nhopefully this works.\n\n578\n00:30:21.914 --> 00:30:23.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n579\n00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:24.340\n&gt;&gt; That would be great, right?\n\n580\n00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.337\nAnd again,\nonce it recreates the restore point,\n\n581\n00:30:28.337 --> 00:30:32.822\nif you do have some kind of\nproblematic functionality.\n\n582\n00:30:32.822 --> 00:30:36.341\nWhether it's after you've installed\na driver, whether it's after you've\n\n583\n00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:39.375\ninstalled an application,\nall you have to do is come up here to, and\n\n584\n00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:42.063\nit's gonna take a second here-\n&gt;&gt; Do updates do it as well?\n\n585\n00:30:42.063 --> 00:30:43.420\nI think updates-\n&gt;&gt; I think updates,\n\n586\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.783\nI think you're right as well, because\nupdates do make some major configuration\n\n587\n00:30:46.783 --> 00:30:48.280\nchanges to your operating system.\n\n588\n00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.904\nDan, I'm glad you brought that one up,\nbecause I do believe that's what happens.\n\n589\n00:30:51.904 --> 00:30:53.940\nAnd I'm kinda limited here on memory, so\n\n590\n00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.150\nthat might be one of the reasons\nthis is kinda taking a little bit.\n\n591\n00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.471\nBut we'll see here.\n\n592\n00:30:58.471 --> 00:31:02.834\nEventually it'll finish, and then I'll\nshow you a little bit more about how you\n\n593\n00:31:02.834 --> 00:31:05.740\nwould essentially roll back\nyour operating system.\n\n594\n00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.280\nAnd I wanna, I don't wanna get too\nmuch into troubleshooting right now,\n\n595\n00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.730\ncuz we'll talk about this.\n\n596\n00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.791\nAnd, in fact, we'll go ahead.\n\n597\n00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:13.770\nAnd I'll tell you what, we'll save this\nfor more of the troubleshooting episode.\n\n598\n00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.390\nBut that's essentially how you\nwould create a restore point, and\n\n599\n00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.910\nwhere you would find System Restore,\nif they ask you on the exam.\n\n600\n00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.574\nNow, I will tell you that we've made it\na little bit farther in our list, but\n\n601\n00:31:24.574 --> 00:31:26.192\nwe've got a lot [LAUGH] more to go.\n\n602\n00:31:26.192 --> 00:31:27.810\nAnd Dan's looking at me again.\n\n603\n00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.437\nI think we might have to put\na comma in this episode [LAUGH].\n\n604\n00:31:30.437 --> 00:31:32.403\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely have to do that.\n\n605\n00:31:32.403 --> 00:31:35.965\nWe basically have chipped away\na pebble off of a boulder,\n\n606\n00:31:35.965 --> 00:31:39.140\ncuz we´ve got a lot of information to\ncover with the Windows operating system.\n\n607\n00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.347\nIt´s a very full featured thing and\nwe have to know a lot about it, so\n\n608\n00:31:42.347 --> 00:31:44.168\nwe´ll just continue down that road.\n\n609\n00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:45.390\nHopefully you´ll join us.\n\n610\n00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.170\nWith that,\nwe´re going to move into a part three.\n\n611\n00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.163\nAs for our lovely part two here,\nwe do hope you´ve enjoyed it, but\n\n612\n00:31:51.163 --> 00:31:54.165\nsigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI´ve been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n613\n00:31:54.165 --> 00:31:55.117\n&gt;&gt; And I´m Wes Bryan.\n\n614\n00:31:55.117 --> 00:31:57.454\n&gt;&gt; And we´ll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:31:57.454 --> 00:32:03.372\n[MUSIC]\n\n616\n00:32:03.372 --> 00:32:06.748\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.994\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:14.022\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.142\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.984\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:25.172\nit is more in our A + series\nthe 229 02 exam for this one.\n\n8\n00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:26.739\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.440\nagain to lend his expertise on that\ntopic our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.380\nWes glad to have you back man,\nhow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.512\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great,\nlooking forward to finishing up\n\n12\n00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:40.173\nsome of the Windows features in this last\npart here, Like Dan has been talking, and\n\n13\n00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:43.657\nwe've both been saying,\nthis is gonna be a trilogy for sure.\n\n14\n00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:47.073\nWe're gonna see if we can keep it\nunder 17 episodes here, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.073 --> 00:00:50.412\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we're gonna go ahead,\n\n16\n00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:55.340\nthere are a few things that we kinda have\nto round off with this objective here.\n\n17\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.930\nAs we move through some of\nthe different features that\n\n18\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.340\nyou can see inside of Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300\nKeep in mind as you can see we're\nalready into our third part\n\n20\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.470\nwe've already covered\na lot of ground already.\n\n21\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.780\nBut there's a little bit of\nsidewalk left to travel there.\n\n22\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.380\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive right in and\n\n23\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.580\nwe're gonna talk about\nsomething known as Ready Boost.\n\n24\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.050\nWhen it comes to the different\nfeatures of Windows.\n\n25\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.020\nNow [LAUGH] So what is Ready Boost?\n\n26\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.020\nWell, Ready Boost,\nthis really came out in the days of Vista.\n\n27\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.150\nAnd it is something that you could\nsee inside of Windows Vista,\n\n28\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.350\nyou could see it inside\nof Windows 7 as well.\n\n29\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.720\nReady Boost is essentially a way that you\ncan take an external USB flash drive and\n\n30\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.530\nyou could use it as your system memory.\n\n31\n00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.110\nWhen Vista first came out it was\nvery very resource intensive.\n\n32\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.730\nIt still is resource intensive for\nthat matter.\n\n33\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.400\nAnd one of the things that they\nknew is that in the days of XP,\n\n34\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.700\nyou still had a lot of laptops around\nthat might only have 512 MB of RAM.\n\n35\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.960\nNow we don't think about that today.\n\n36\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.900\nIn fact most of us probably have four\ntimes that in our phones alone and\n\n37\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.198\nin our mobile devices.\n\n38\n00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:08.510\nEssentially, Ready Boost is a technology\nthat allows you to take flash memory and\n\n39\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.670\nuse it as though it's your\nsystem memory to try for\n\n40\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.750\nthe purposes of speeding up,\nif you will your machine.\n\n41\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.070\nNow when we talk about Ready Boost,\n\n42\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.200\nthere are some things that we want to be\naware of when it comes to Ready Boost.\n\n43\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.600\nReady Boost, you have to understand\nis that capacity of the USB\n\n44\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.210\nflashdrive that you are gonna\nuse has to be at least 256 MB.\n\n45\n00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.140\nAnd again by today's standards,\nas of 2017 a lot of us don't even\n\n46\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.570\nhave USB thumb drives that\nare really that small.\n\n47\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.070\nIf we do, they are in a box\nsomewhere collecting dust.\n\n48\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.650\nSo, very basically, again we can\nextend that functionality into the USB\n\n49\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.370\nthumb drive, using it as an additional\namount of your system memory.\n\n50\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.770\nAll right some of the other things too,\nto keep in mind is that\n\n51\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.740\nwith the Ready Boost requirements.\n\n52\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.840\nThe thumb drive had to support\n2.5 MB transfers per second and\n\n53\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.239\nthroughput, and support for\n4K random read.\n\n54\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.838\nNow it also had to have 1.75 MB per second\nthrough put for 1 MB random rate as well.\n\n55\n00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:24.215\nSo you did have some specifications\nthat you needed to be able to,\n\n56\n00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:27.980\nwere required for the USB flash drive.\n\n57\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.900\nSo, that's a little bit about Ready Boost.\n\n58\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.934\nAnd again it's not really so necessary\ntoday when we have solid state drives\n\n59\n00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:39.985\ninside of our systems today that\nare really, really ultra fast if you will.\n\n60\n00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:44.887\nIt was beneficial more so for\nolder systems especially coming out of\n\n61\n00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:49.789\nXP because XP didn't require a lot\nof the resources that Vista did,\n\n62\n00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.143\nwhen you can see systems\nwith 512 MB of RAM.\n\n63\n00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:56.354\nSo some of the other things that we\nhave to talk about is something called\n\n64\n00:03:56.354 --> 00:03:57.380\ncompatibility mode.\n\n65\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.670\nCompatibility mode is\na good feature because,\n\n66\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.415\nwell, as we've talked about in other\nparts here in the Windows features,\n\n67\n00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:07.010\nwe've mentioned something known\nas the User Account Control.\n\n68\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.990\nAnd the User Account Control\nbrought in a completely new,\n\n69\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.980\nunderlying security architecture.\n\n70\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.586\nAnd the problem with that is\nsome of the applications,\n\n71\n00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:19.031\nwhen we talk about compatibility going\nfrom XP we still had line of business\n\n72\n00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:21.509\napplications that well\npeople didn't wanna let go.\n\n73\n00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.972\nIf you think about spending a couple\nhundred dollars out of your own pocket for\n\n74\n00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:28.702\nan application that you're going to use\nin the home environment you probably say,\n\n75\n00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:32.027\nwell that's a good bit of money that\nyou're spending on an application.\n\n76\n00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:37.256\nSo you really want to get as much of the\nlifetime you can out of that application\n\n77\n00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:42.727\nwithout having to upgrade to spending\nanother couple hundred to support Vista,\n\n78\n00:04:42.727 --> 00:04:45.730\nWindows 7, if you will, Windows 8.1.\n\n79\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.620\nEven more so if you had a line of business\napplication within your company that\n\n80\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.700\ncould probably cost you\nthousands of dollars.\n\n81\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands even, yeah.\n\n82\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.640\n&gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands, right.\n\n83\n00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.290\nSo businesses want it in a way that they\ncan continue using the functionality those\n\n84\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.900\nwhat are called LOB applications,\nLine Of Business applications.\n\n85\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.480\nSo Windows brings in something\nknown as compatibility mode.\n\n86\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.584\nNow compatibility mode, honestly guys,\nto make it really easy.\n\n87\n00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:11.644\nIt just allows you to run your\napplication in the context of an earlier\n\n88\n00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.558\noperating system.\n\n89\n00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:17.708\nTo try to mimic the architecture that\na operating system was running [CROSSTALK]\n\n90\n00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Is this an emulation?\n\n91\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.600\nHow do they accomplish that,\nis that what they did?\n\n92\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.962\n&gt;&gt; Underneath the hardware,\nI am really not sure [CROSSTALK]\n\n93\n00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:25.807\n&gt;&gt; I never heard either.\n\n94\n00:05:25.807 --> 00:05:28.255\n&gt;&gt; I think, cuz we have certain-\n&gt;&gt; There's your homework.\n\n95\n00:05:28.255 --> 00:05:29.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n96\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.570\nWe have different folder structures,\nif you will.\n\n97\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.260\nAnd that was one of the things like,\nso for\n\n98\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.100\ninstance, when we talk about file\npaths and folder structures.\n\n99\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.371\nIn the days of XP, your user profile\nwould be in SQL and /documents and\n\n100\n00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:45.370\nsettings, / the user profile,\nthe user name.\n\n101\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.790\nWell in Vista, or Windows 7,\nthey're both the same,\n\n102\n00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.390\nin fact from Vista on, the folder\nstructure was completely different.\n\n103\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.660\nIn fact if I show you my\nWindows 7 machine here, and\n\n104\n00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.970\nwe open up our Windows Explorer,\nwe get into computer local disk C.\n\n105\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.190\nYou'll see that we have here,\nin fact let me change this a little bit.\n\n106\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.960\nNotice we have C: and\nthat is the root of the drive here, Users.\n\n107\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.819\nAnd let me go ahead and dive down in here.\n\n108\n00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.393\nAnd these are where the user profiles\nwere in the days of XP again it would\n\n109\n00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:22.290\nhave SQL and /documents and setting and\nthen / whatever the user name was.\n\n110\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.350\nSo it's a completely\ndifferent file structure.\n\n111\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.520\nAnd you're probably right in the fact\nthat it's doing some kind of emulation\n\n112\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.560\nas well as in the background\nfolder redirection.\n\n113\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.660\nWhere it makes it appear to be\napplication as those folder paths and\n\n114\n00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.440\nstructures are the same.\n\n115\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.980\nSo how would I use if I was gonna use a\ncompatibility mode, how would I use that?\n\n116\n00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.524\nWell I've actually got\nan application here,\n\n117\n00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:43.880\nI think this is\na Solar Winds product here.\n\n118\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.940\nManage Engine Windows Health Monitor.\n\n119\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.420\nAnd if I right click on this\napplication and I chose properties.\n\n120\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.100\nYou'll see that in the properties\nof this application I\n\n121\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.210\nhave what's known as\nthe compatibility tab.\n\n122\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.030\nYou have a few different tabs here.\n\n123\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.680\nYou have the security tab which\nshows you permissions if you will,\n\n124\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.500\nthe general details of\nthe application itself.\n\n125\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.550\nDigital Signatures which is just\na security stamp on it that says, hey,\n\n126\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.150\nwe can verify that in this case,\nthis came from ZOHO Corporation.\n\n127\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.610\nSo it's a little security information\nproving that the identity\n\n128\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.360\nof who the manufacture\nis of this application.\n\n129\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.470\nPrevious versions this\nis where we talked about\n\n130\n00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.130\nin another part of this about\nthe volume shadow copy service.\n\n131\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.100\nAnd being able to restore your\nfile to an earlier point in time.\n\n132\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.260\nBut more or so for\nus we want this compatibility mode.\n\n133\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.860\nAs they introduce things like\nthe User Account Control,\n\n134\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.980\nthat could break some of these\napplications that really weren't expecting\n\n135\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.670\nanything with the User Account Control.\n\n136\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.560\nAnd what I mean by that is they were\nexpecting to have access to the registry\n\n137\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.525\nand be able to manipulate it at will.\n\n138\n00:07:50.525 --> 00:07:54.313\nWell, when the User Account Control\ncame out, it protects the registry and\n\n139\n00:07:54.313 --> 00:07:57.288\nit blocks that being able to write and\nmake modifications.\n\n140\n00:07:57.288 --> 00:08:01.089\nAnd that could cause an application to\nEither just they have a problematic\n\n141\n00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:03.492\nfunctionality or\nreally not function at all.\n\n142\n00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:06.761\nSo what you can do here\nis in compatibility mode,\n\n143\n00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:11.546\nI can run this program in a compatibility\nmode 4, could be emulation,\n\n144\n00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:16.090\ncould be folder redirection,\nmaybe making it mimic.\n\n145\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.484\nThe platform essentially that\nyou would want to run on, right?\n\n146\n00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:23.189\nSo you could see XP with Service Pack 3\nand I believe there's a Service Pack 2\n\n147\n00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:26.040\nprobably in here because I was\na major change in Windows XP.\n\n148\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.140\nAnd notice that we can even do it in the\ncontext the server operating system some\n\n149\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.780\nof them go all the way back to Windows 95.\n\n150\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.860\nAnd I would say if you still have\nan application around and you're still\n\n151\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.212\nin the Windows 7 and beyond days and\nyou wanna run it is as a compatibility for\n\n152\n00:08:40.212 --> 00:08:45.176\nWindows 95, probably time to upgrade but\nI'm not paying the price of the software.\n\n153\n00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.889\nSo maybe you've got-\n&gt;&gt; That original version of Quake I\n\n154\n00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:48.519\nneed to run.\n\n155\n00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.155\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n156\n00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.621\nOr if you're a retro Retro gamer.\n\n157\n00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:52.322\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n158\n00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:53.710\n&gt;&gt; If you're a retro gamer and\n\n159\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.980\nyou expected it to run in some of\nthese older operating systems.\n\n160\n00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.400\nBut notice we can run in a context,\nin the compatibility mode for\n\n161\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.730\nearlier operating systems.\n\n162\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.755\nAnd that's a good thing and\n\n163\n00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:07.260\nit's definitely as much as\nwe kind of joke around here.\n\n164\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.410\nIts good to have them when you're\npaying the price for the application,\n\n165\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.260\nwhether it's the home user or it's the\nbusiness user like upwards of $100,000.\n\n166\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.638\nOr hundreds of thousands of dollars for\nyour application,\n\n167\n00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:23.028\njust gives you the ability to extend\nthe lifespan of that application without\n\n168\n00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:24.527\nhaving to upgrade later.\n\n169\n00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:28.147\nAll right, now we've got some\nother things here too as well.\n\n170\n00:09:28.147 --> 00:09:31.166\nAnd one of these I don't really\nhave a demonstration for you.\n\n171\n00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:33.931\nI try to demonstrate as many\nof these as possible, but\n\n172\n00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:36.455\nthis one's something\nknown as Virtual XP mode.\n\n173\n00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:38.283\nIt's also about compatibility.\n\n174\n00:09:38.283 --> 00:09:42.236\nYou would have applications that the\ncompatibility mode that we just showed you\n\n175\n00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:46.493\nweren't really feasible, would not allow\nthe application to function correctly.\n\n176\n00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:50.645\nSo what they did,\nis they used a virtualization technology.\n\n177\n00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:54.281\nAnd what we mean by\nvirtualization is the ability for\n\n178\n00:09:54.281 --> 00:09:58.835\nthe operating system to run within\nan operating system, right?\n\n179\n00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:02.020\nOr we talk about virtualization\non a hardware platform.\n\n180\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.810\nThat's the ability of\ntwo operating systems\n\n181\n00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.730\nto simultaneously be controlling the\nhardware unlike something like multi-boot.\n\n182\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.202\nWhen you have a multi-boot solution\nwhat you end up having is one\n\n183\n00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:16.223\noperating system boots up,\nit controls the hardware,\n\n184\n00:10:16.223 --> 00:10:19.646\nwhich essentially is what\nan operating system allows us to do.\n\n185\n00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:23.398\nThen once you're done using that\noperating system, you shut it down and\n\n186\n00:10:23.398 --> 00:10:26.400\nyou boot and\nselect into the second operating system.\n\n187\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.200\nIt comes online,\nit takes control of the hardware.\n\n188\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.580\nBut in a multi-boot situation you\nonly have one operating system,\n\n189\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.970\ncontrolling the hardware, having access\nto the hardware at any given time.\n\n190\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.990\nAnd virtualization, that type of\ntechnology allows more than one operating\n\n191\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.675\nsystem to be running simultaneously\non the same hardware platform.\n\n192\n00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:51.350\nWhile Virtual XP Mode, was a away\n\n193\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:57.010\nthat they allowed you to\nvirtualize your application and\n\n194\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.320\nrun it in the context of XP,\nkind of like compatibility mode.\n\n195\n00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.070\nBut essentially, you would be\nrunning it in an operating system\n\n196\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.400\nwithin an operating system, giving you the\nability to continue to use those XP based\n\n197\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.440\napplications that knew nothing\nabout the user account control.\n\n198\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.744\nOr that different architecture as well\nas the file structures, right, and\n\n199\n00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:18.235\npaths that have changed.\n\n200\n00:11:18.235 --> 00:11:21.957\nNow the next thing that we have here is\nalso something known as easy transfer.\n\n201\n00:11:21.957 --> 00:11:26.276\nThis is the Windows Easy Transfer and this\nis a great thing is as you are upgrading\n\n202\n00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:30.853\nfrom all one operating system to the next,\nyou might wanna save things like, well,\n\n203\n00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:34.420\nyour applications, you might\nwanna save things like your data.\n\n204\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.893\nAnd you might wanna make sure that they\nare loaded up into the same locations when\n\n205\n00:11:38.893 --> 00:11:42.330\nyou move from one edition\nof Windows to the next.\n\n206\n00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.750\nWell, that's where\nWindows Easy Transfer comes in.\n\n207\n00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:53.090\nWindows Easy Transfer allows you a very\nintuitive wizard driven interface in\n\n208\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:58.510\nwhich you can transfer those settings,\nthose files if you will,\n\n209\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.360\nfrom the old Windows edition, or the old\nWindows version to let's say Windows 7.\n\n210\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.859\nAnd let me show you here, and\nit's also on Windows Vista too,\n\n211\n00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:08.039\nI just happen to be kind of\nmore focused on Windows 7.\n\n212\n00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.266\n&gt;&gt; Love this thing by the way.\n\n213\n00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:13.723\nI mean this, as you're an A+ technician\nyou're probably going to be working with\n\n214\n00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:16.474\nhome users quite a bit as\nyou get into the business.\n\n215\n00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:18.263\nAnd this is something\nyou're going to need to do.\n\n216\n00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:19.327\nThey buy a new computer,\n\n217\n00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:22.177\nthey want to transfer their files\nfrom the old computer to the new.\n\n218\n00:12:22.177 --> 00:12:25.622\nThis thing makes it so easy,\nthe wizard really works well.\n\n219\n00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:27.579\nReally thought this was a home run for\nMicrosoft.\n\n220\n00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:28.399\n&gt;&gt; It really was and,\n\n221\n00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.586\nin fact, let me go ahead and\nas I'm talking about it, we'll mention it.\n\n222\n00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:36.968\nAll I'm doing is typing in Windows,\nand if I type in Windows Easy.\n\n223\n00:12:36.968 --> 00:12:39.046\nI don't know what Easty is but Easy.\n\n224\n00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:43.284\nWe can see Windows Easy Transfer here and\nI'll go ahead and launch this up.\n\n225\n00:12:43.284 --> 00:12:46.455\nAnd you can see one of the things\nthat it allows you to do, right?\n\n226\n00:12:46.455 --> 00:12:50.165\nTransfer user documents, or user accounts,\ndocuments, music, pictures, and\n\n227\n00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:53.664\nI love the fact that Dan mentioned that\nyou're buying a new computer, right?\n\n228\n00:12:53.664 --> 00:12:56.260\nOr a customer comes in and\nthey're buying a new computer.\n\n229\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.730\nWe want to take all of this information\nthat you see in this list and\n\n230\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.850\nwe want to move it to the new\ninstance of the computer.\n\n231\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.630\nOr how about this?\n\n232\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.040\nHow about the reason to buy a new computer\nbecause the old ones failed, right?\n\n233\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.530\nOr the old one is failing, right?\n\n234\n00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.990\nIt's problematic in anyway.\n\n235\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.524\nThis is such a great thing that\nI can run this type of wizard.\n\n236\n00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:15.687\nNow they also made it even easier\nthan this in fact you can get\n\n237\n00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:19.925\na Windows Easy Transfer USB base cable and\nyou can plug it from one end to one end,\n\n238\n00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:22.600\nand I mean one computer to the next.\n\n239\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.589\nWindows would recognize it as a WET cable,\nWIndows Easy Transfer cable,\n\n240\n00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:28.724\nand it would start the process for you.\n\n241\n00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:31.461\nCompletely automated and I wouldn't\neven have to worry about the wizard.\n\n242\n00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:34.429\nSo, hence the name, very easy, right.\n\n243\n00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:37.733\nSo and we can tell Windows Easy Transfer,\nokay, Next.\n\n244\n00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:40.407\n&gt;&gt; I guess that makes sense for\nthem to make it as easy as possible for\n\n245\n00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:42.003\nyou to continue to use their product.\n\n246\n00:13:42.003 --> 00:13:43.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely,\n\n247\n00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:45.256\nmost definitely cuz that means you'll\njust come back and buy more, right?\n\n248\n00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:46.374\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n249\n00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:48.294\n&gt;&gt; And you notice that you have\na series of options, right?\n\n250\n00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:52.020\nThere is the easy transfer cable,\nthe WET cable that I was talking about.\n\n251\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.070\nI could transfer this to the network,\nright?\n\n252\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.900\nSo if you're in a business type\nenvironment maybe transfer it to a network\n\n253\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.258\nshare, a shared folder or\n\n254\n00:13:59.258 --> 00:14:02.744\na resource where everybody can gain\naccess to it over the network.\n\n255\n00:14:02.744 --> 00:14:06.648\nOr we could use some kind of external USB\nbased device that you would plug into\n\n256\n00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:10.140\nthe machine and you could transfer\nthese files over there, right?\n\n257\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.684\nSo Windows Easy Transfer, very very\ngood way, a lot easier than some of\n\n258\n00:14:14.684 --> 00:14:18.792\nthe other corporate level\ntransferring systems that you have.\n\n259\n00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:20.788\nLike the user state migration tool.\n\n260\n00:14:20.788 --> 00:14:24.207\nAnd we'll mention that in another episode.\n\n261\n00:14:24.207 --> 00:14:25.968\nAll right, so\nsome of the other things that we have,\n\n262\n00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:27.743\nwe have what are known as\nthe administrative tools.\n\n263\n00:14:27.743 --> 00:14:32.002\nAnd the great thing about administrative\ntools is they are in Control Panels,\n\n264\n00:14:32.002 --> 00:14:35.370\njust pay attention to which\noperating system that you are in.\n\n265\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:40.135\nKeep in mind that we have already said in\nVista, it is, you go to the Start button,\n\n266\n00:14:40.135 --> 00:14:44.283\nControl Panel, you remember it's\nSystem and Maintenance inside of,\n\n267\n00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:48.104\nreally Windows 7 and beyond,\nyou'll see System and Security.\n\n268\n00:14:48.104 --> 00:14:49.286\nSo for instance let me show you.\n\n269\n00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:53.982\nIf I go to the Start button and\nchoose Control Panel, System and\n\n270\n00:14:53.982 --> 00:14:58.689\nSecurity, we have Administrative Tools\nright here, right?\n\n271\n00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.606\nI could also do this inside of Vista.\n\n272\n00:15:00.606 --> 00:15:03.027\nI can go to the Start button,\nI can go to Control Panel,\n\n273\n00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:06.670\na little bit different remember,\nSystem and Maintenance.\n\n274\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.016\nAnd if I scroll all the way down, and\nlook, we've got Administrative Tools.\n\n275\n00:15:10.016 --> 00:15:12.663\nAnd you can see a different coat of paint,\nbut for the most part,\n\n276\n00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:14.243\nthey're pretty much the same thing.\n\n277\n00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:15.265\nAnd you know what, why not?\n\n278\n00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:17.420\nWe'll knock it out of\nthe ballpark here too.\n\n279\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.242\n&gt;&gt; The trifecta.\n\n280\n00:15:18.242 --> 00:15:21.215\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely, we'll\nright click on the Windows tile there,\n\n281\n00:15:21.215 --> 00:15:23.331\nit's not really the Windows Start\nbutton if you will.\n\n282\n00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.545\nAnd we can choose Control Panel here.\n\n283\n00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:29.848\nWe'll choose Control Panel,\nyou'll see when Control Panel opens up,\n\n284\n00:15:29.848 --> 00:15:33.152\nnotice that it's System and\nSecurity as well, so just like Windows 7,\n\n285\n00:15:33.152 --> 00:15:36.050\nit keeps it a little bit easier for\nyou guys and girls out there.\n\n286\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.760\nAnd then if we scroll down at the bottom,\nnotice we also have Administrative Tools,\n\n287\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.750\nand there again,\nhere are Administrative Tools, right?\n\n288\n00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.622\nSo, in Administrative Tools, we're\ngonna look a little bit more at these.\n\n289\n00:15:45.622 --> 00:15:47.677\nSo we're just kinda giving\na high level overview.\n\n290\n00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:49.782\nWe'll talk about these in\nlater episodes coming up,\n\n291\n00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.795\ncuz you'll have to know a little more\nabout what each one of these tools use.\n\n292\n00:15:52.795 --> 00:15:56.813\nBut this is a really good location for\nalmost just about any\n\n293\n00:15:56.813 --> 00:16:01.740\nadministrative functionality that\nyou have to perform on a computer.\n\n294\n00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.330\nWhether it be maintaining\nthe up keep of the computer.\n\n295\n00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.700\nWhether it be performing recovery,\nwhether it be automating things.\n\n296\n00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.440\nWhether it be managing\nyour storage devices,\n\n297\n00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.660\nyou have a ton of different things\nhere in administrative tools.\n\n298\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.620\nSo know a little bit about them.\n\n299\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.170\nKnow where to find them as well.\n\n300\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.610\nAll right?\n\n301\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:22.700\nAll right, let's see what else do we got?\n\n302\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.780\nWe have what's known as Windows Defender,\nall right?\n\n303\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.820\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and yes,\nI'm gonna show you exactly how to get to\n\n304\n00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.550\nWindows Defender, and\nwe're gonna go the scenic route.\n\n305\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.430\nAgain, it's one of those things\nthat you have to know on the exam.\n\n306\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.940\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go to\n\n307\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.760\nthe start button and\nwe're gonna go back to control panel.\n\n308\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.840\nAnd I wanna talk about this\nlittle setting right here.\n\n309\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.625\nNotice there's category this is called a\ncategory view, view by category, large and\n\n310\n00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:51.420\nsmall icons.\n\n311\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.370\nNow, you'll see in the exam objectives,\n\n312\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.020\nthey actually mention something\nknown as category and classic view.\n\n313\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.280\nWell, you used to have\nclassic view inside of Vista.\n\n314\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.190\nHere's the thing.\n\n315\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.540\nAfter Vista, they no longer call\nit classic view or category view.\n\n316\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.780\nAgain, here's your category view.\n\n317\n00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.870\nNotice it's no different than Windows 7 or\nWindows 8.1.\n\n318\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.000\nBut they also had what's\ncalled a classic view.\n\n319\n00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.157\nAnd the classic view is what\na lot of people like, right?\n\n320\n00:17:16.157 --> 00:17:17.610\nBecause.\n&gt;&gt; You mean the right view?\n\n321\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:18.250\n&gt;&gt; The right view see?\n\n322\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.526\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got somebody who's been in\n\n323\n00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:22.627\nsystems administration for\nquite a few years.\n\n324\n00:17:22.627 --> 00:17:24.055\nThis is why they call it,\n\n325\n00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:28.135\na lot of people like it because some\npeople have the option that category\n\n326\n00:17:28.135 --> 00:17:32.215\nview is like a door in front of a door\nthat leads to another door that leads\n\n327\n00:17:32.215 --> 00:17:36.135\nto a door that finally leads you\nto the utility that you want.\n\n328\n00:17:36.135 --> 00:17:38.260\nWhere classic view,\neverything is opened up.\n\n329\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.660\nWe don´t have these category views,\nwe've got it alphabetized from A to Z.\n\n330\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.650\nHere are all the utilities\nthat I need to get to.\n\n331\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.540\nHowever, I will tell you that\nonce they moved away from this,\n\n332\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.970\nit was called the same thing in XP,\nclassic view versus category view?\n\n333\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.960\nOnce they moved away from Vista,\nit´s called category view or\n\n334\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.575\nlarge icon small icons.\n\n335\n00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:58.240\nDon't let that trip you up on\nthe exam because as you can see,\n\n336\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.190\nwe're doing the same thing.\n\n337\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.210\nFrom A to Z, this is what we find, right?.\n\n338\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.570\nAnd long intro into something\nknown as Windows Defender.\n\n339\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.735\nAll right, Windows Defender is called out,\nand if we launch up Windows Defender,\n\n340\n00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:14.300\nit looks like it's turned off, let's go\nahead and just click, let's turn it on.\n\n341\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.800\nThey give you the ability to choose\n\n342\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.320\nwhat kind of anti-malware\nsoftware you want to run.\n\n343\n00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.530\nSo you might see that, for instance\nhere by default, it isn't turned on,\n\n344\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.180\nWindows defender and again,\nit's just giving you that choice.\n\n345\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.420\nWe'll let this go ahead and run,\nwe'll also show you same thing here.\n\n346\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:37.110\nInside of your Windows 8.1 machine\nif I switch from category view.\n\n347\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.990\nAnd I'll just do this large icons for\nmy four eyes it works great.\n\n348\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.770\nNotice that I also have\nWindows Defender here as well.\n\n349\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:48.450\nNow Windows Defender inside of Windows\n8 and beyond is turned on by default.\n\n350\n00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.320\nNotice it didn't tell me to turn on.\n\n351\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.480\nWhen Windows Defender first got integrated\ninto the operating system like this,\n\n352\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.350\nthey gave you the ability again to make\nyour choice at what you wanna run.\n\n353\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.788\nOn here they say okay, we'll secure it\nby default and if you wanna install\n\n354\n00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:06.510\nsomething, you'll install something,\nthen come back and turn it off later.\n\n355\n00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.578\nBecause some people wouldn't even do this.\n\n356\n00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:12.610\nAnd again, it's better to have a little\nbit of protection than have no protection\n\n357\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.570\nat all and something causes problems.\n\n358\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.850\nAnd that's essentially what\nWindows Defender allows you to do.\n\n359\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.220\nIt allows you to go through here and\n\n360\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.520\nwe can update our spyware definition,\nour definitions in general if you will,\n\n361\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.280\nvirus definitions, and\nwe get an anti-malware service.\n\n362\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.680\nWe can run scans,\nwe can schedule scans inside of here.\n\n363\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.750\nSo, be aware of Windows Defender.\n\n364\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.070\nNow in that same line of thinking here,\n\n365\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.970\nyou also have what's known\nas the Windows Firewall.\n\n366\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.720\nAnd I'll go ahead and stay in Windows 8.1,\n\n367\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.730\nwe haven't been given Windows 8.1 too\nmuch attention in the features here.\n\n368\n00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.780\nSo, just kind of get you\nfamiliar with that as well.\n\n369\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.580\nIf I go to Control Panel, and\nI go to System and Security,\n\n370\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.470\nnotice that we have the Windows Firewall\nright here, and I could choose that.\n\n371\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.290\nAnd inside of the Windows firewall,\nremember what a firewall does.\n\n372\n00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.990\nA firewall is a way that I can allow or\nblock, right?\n\n373\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.280\nSo I can allow information or\n\n374\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.110\ncommunications to come in\nthrough over the network,\n\n375\n00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.330\nin through the network adaptor and\ncommunicate with the operating system.\n\n376\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.020\nAnd likewise, on the reverse side of this,\nI can allow a communication\n\n377\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.920\noutbound from this computer across the\nnetwork, across the Internet, if you will.\n\n378\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.070\nAnd we can either allow or deny.\n\n379\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.420\nWe can make what are known as exceptions,\nright?\n\n380\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.450\nNow why do they call them exceptions?\n\n381\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.370\nWell, because the default rule.\n\n382\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.160\nSays that every bit of information that\ncomes into your computer is blocked.\n\n383\n00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:36.270\nExcept those applications that you allow,\nhence the term exceptions right?\n\n384\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.610\nWe have a very basic functionality\nthat we can allow an application or\n\n385\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.890\na feature to communicate if\nyou will through the firewall.\n\n386\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.010\nAnd that means inbound, right?\n\n387\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.650\nAll outbound communications from my\ncomputer to other computers over\n\n388\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.850\nthe network or over the Internet it's\ngonna be allowed by default, all right?\n\n389\n00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.040\nAnd you can see that I have\nto be an administrative user.\n\n390\n00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.440\nRemember one of the things\nthat we talked about the user\n\n391\n00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.800\naccount from key security settings\nbeing modified in any way, right?\n\n392\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.930\nAnd if I wanna change these, I can do so.\n\n393\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.340\nWe'll go ahead and\nallow this to change, and\n\n394\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.000\nyou'll notice they're\nno longer greyed out.\n\n395\n00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.170\nAnd let's say, for instance,\nI wanted to allow Remote Desktop, right?\n\n396\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.070\nI wanted to make a connection\nfrom another computer\n\n397\n00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.890\nover the network back to this one.\n\n398\n00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.590\nIt's blocked by default,\nexcept, again exceptions.\n\n399\n00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.424\nIf I say, yeah I'm gonna allow\nRemote Desktop to communicate, right?\n\n400\n00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:28.440\nNow that's not the only\nthing we would have to do,\n\n401\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.942\nif we were gonna allow Remote Desktop\nto communicate as well.\n\n402\n00:21:30.942 --> 00:21:35.248\nWe'd also have to come in here to\nthe System Properties by right-clicking in\n\n403\n00:21:35.248 --> 00:21:39.949\nthis case Windows 8.1, it would be your\nStart tile, or Windows tile if you will,\n\n404\n00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:42.561\nStart button,\nyou just put Start if you will.\n\n405\n00:21:42.561 --> 00:21:48.219\nThen you go to Control Panel,\nagain System and Security and then System.\n\n406\n00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:50.515\nI'm just gonna cheat a little bit here,\nI'm gonna right click and\n\n407\n00:21:50.515 --> 00:21:52.240\njust choose System.\n\n408\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.230\nAnd then notice that we have\nin our System properties,\n\n409\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.670\nwe've already showed you how to\nlocate this, I have Remote settings.\n\n410\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.920\nBy default, Remote Desktop that allows me\nto essentially go to another computer.\n\n411\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.710\nConnect back to this one and\ntake control over the desktop and\n\n412\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.720\nwork with it just like I'm sitting\nright here in front of it.\n\n413\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.650\nBy default it is disabled and\nI would have to enable that.\n\n414\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.837\nThe other one is something\nknown as remote assistance, and\n\n415\n00:22:19.837 --> 00:22:22.840\na remote assistance is a way that I\ncan share control of the desktop.\n\n416\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.490\nLet's say Dan is helping me out\nbecause I got an application\n\n417\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.190\nI can't figure out how to work it,\nI can't get it configured.\n\n418\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.090\nWell I could actually send\nan invitation to Dan and say, Dan,\n\n419\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.770\nI need some remote assistance.\n\n420\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.530\nI wouldn't have to say that.\n\n421\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.800\nBut that's what it's called.\n\n422\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.940\nAnd Dan could connect to my computer and\nwe could share control,\n\n423\n00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.120\nwhich means he could see what I'm seeing,\nI could see what he's doing and\n\n424\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.580\nallow him to walk me through the app.\n\n425\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.620\nThe difference here is, in remote desktop,\n\n426\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.300\nwhat we end up doing is we're actually\ntaking control over the desktop.\n\n427\n00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.500\nSo if Dan uses remote desktop to connect\nto my computer over the network,\n\n428\n00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.880\nI'm gonna get logged out, right?\n\n429\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.170\nNo different than doing a local login.\n\n430\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.060\nSo essentially that's a little bit\nabout remote desktop in the same breath\n\n431\n00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.800\nthat we're talking about allowing\napplications through the firewall.\n\n432\n00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.226\nIt is a feature of Windows and\n\n433\n00:23:05.226 --> 00:23:08.684\nit is one that you'll wanna be aware\nof as well as the basic firewall.\n\n434\n00:23:08.684 --> 00:23:11.531\nNow, if you wanted to get\na little bit more advanced,\n\n435\n00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:14.887\nyou have a lot more granular\ncontrol by using something known as\n\n436\n00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:17.439\nthe Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Settings.\n\n437\n00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:22.005\nBut we'll save that for\nour security episodes here at\n\n438\n00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:26.580\n902 because we're not quite there yet.\n\n439\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.190\nNow in Windows Vista,\nthey had what was known, and\n\n440\n00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.140\ntimeout period it looks\nlike it's turned off.\n\n441\n00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.110\nI have to turn\nthe Windows Defender service off,\n\n442\n00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.220\nit looks like it's been disabled.\n\n443\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.070\nThat's one of the issues that\nyou would might have here.\n\n444\n00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.160\nNow the other thing that we also have\nto understand is that inside a for\n\n445\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.400\ninstance your Windows Vista\nmachines right?\n\n446\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.150\nYou have what's known as security center,\nall right?\n\n447\n00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.360\nAnd security center would allow\nyou the ability to control\n\n448\n00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.430\nkey security settings and\nsee them kind of at a quick glance.\n\n449\n00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.370\nI do want to kind of\ndifferentiate this from another\n\n450\n00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:08.560\ntype of security piece of software that\nwe have, Security Center is in Vista.\n\n451\n00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.810\nWhen they moved into Windows 7 and\nbeyond, they changed it a little bit.\n\n452\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.700\nIts not longer called Security Center.\n\n453\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.740\nIf we go to Start, we go to Control Panel,\n\n454\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:22.030\nand change this back to category view\nthere, and go to System and Security.\n\n455\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.300\nNotice that they have what's now\ncalled the Action Center, right?\n\n456\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.380\nSo, they don't call that out on\nthe exam but it's doing the same thing.\n\n457\n00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.220\nNotice I can see Security.\n\n458\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.060\nAnd if I expand this out I can see\na lot of the Key Security Settings and\n\n459\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.160\nAction Center.\n\n460\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.320\nNotice that they do call out on your\nexam objectives for 902 Security Center.\n\n461\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.583\nAnd specifically that's\nsomething in Vista.\n\n462\n00:24:41.583 --> 00:24:45.308\nWe still have that technology today but\nlike we've kind of been stressing here.\n\n463\n00:24:45.308 --> 00:24:49.420\nSometimes Microsoft puts a new coat of\npaint over a technology that's been\n\n464\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.310\naround a while and\nthey changed the name on it.\n\n465\n00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.220\nAnd that's essentially what you have here.\n\n466\n00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.980\nAll right, let's see Dan, well I said\nwe might be able to round it up.\n\n467\n00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In this one but\n\n468\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.010\nit does look like we still have more.\n\n469\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.610\nSo it looks like we might\nhave to go into a part 4, but\n\n470\n00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:03.970\nI don't think we're gonna\ndo it right in here.\n\n471\n00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.260\n&gt;&gt; No, definitely Wes is a big fat liar.\n\n472\n00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.540\nSo, but what are you gonna do, right?\n\n473\n00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.610\nWe work with what we got.\n\n474\n00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.140\nNo, we kid the Wes.\n\n475\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.670\nHaving a good time.\n\n476\n00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.200\nIt's just a lot of information when it\ncomes to Windows because it's such a fully\n\n477\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.930\nfeatured operating system so\nit takes a while.\n\n478\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.499\nWe want to make sure that you good folks\nout there that are watching get your\n\n479\n00:25:19.499 --> 00:25:20.536\nmoney's worth, and\n\n480\n00:25:20.536 --> 00:25:24.180\nunderstand every piece of minutia that\nthis exam is gonna call out for you.\n\n481\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.963\nSo we're gonna take our time, and\nwe're gonna work our way through it, and\n\n482\n00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:30.160\nif that means going into a part four, well\nby goodness, we're going into a part four.\n\n483\n00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.380\nSo join us for that, hopefully you've\nenjoyed part three so far, but\n\n484\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.970\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n485\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.240\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n486\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes, never stop talking, Bryan.\n\n487\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.632\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n488\n00:25:41.632 --> 00:25:47.562\n[MUSIC]\n\n489\n00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:50.050\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:08.116\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:12.265\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:14.145\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:18.793\nwelcome back to another exciting episode\nof ITPRO.TV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:23.314\nAnd in today's episode, well, I hope\nyou're back for more of our A+ Series,\n\n8\n00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:28.255\ncuz we've got a little series going inside\nof our big series, that is the 22902.\n\n9\n00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:33.343\nIf you're checking that off, make sure\nyou have the right A + series, [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:37.099\nJoining us again today is our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.074\nWes, we're glad to have you, man.\n\n12\n00:00:38.074 --> 00:00:38.804\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.811\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great for\ninfinite regression, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.548\nA series within a series within a series.\n\n15\n00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:45.449\n&gt;&gt; It's like looking in a mirror,\nlooking in a mirror.\n\n16\n00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.880\n&gt;&gt; Those little Russian dolls.\n\n17\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.718\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right we are coming back with\n\n18\n00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:53.691\npart four, and well we hope the finale\nwhen it comes to the features of Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:56.177\nWe've been talking about all\ndifferent kinds of features and\n\n20\n00:00:56.177 --> 00:00:58.345\nwe've got a handful that we\nstill have to talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.112\nSo, we will go ahead and\nwe will dive right in.\n\n22\n00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:05.645\nKeep in mind, the objective that we've\nbeen looking at is 1.1, Comparing contrast\n\n23\n00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:09.270\nvarious features and requirements\nof the Windows Operating System.\n\n24\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320\nAnd they do call out the various Windows\noperating systems that we've been\n\n25\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.035\nlooking at.\n\n26\n00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:17.400\nNow one of the things I want you to\nkeep in mind is they call out Windows\n\n27\n00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.002\n8 as well.\n\n28\n00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:23.979\nBut Windows 8, 8.1 are really, really\nclose, similar in their functionality.\n\n29\n00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.461\nWindows 8.1 I believe brought in some\nextra features there that are very,\n\n30\n00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:32.085\nvery small in the differences here.\n\n31\n00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.231\nReally, when it comes down to it you get\nto some of the administrative features.\n\n32\n00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:37.721\nSo, we're gonna continue on this path.\n\n33\n00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:41.268\nNow, one of the features, if you will,\nis actually a utility and\n\n34\n00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.055\na tool that's been around for\na good, long while.\n\n35\n00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:47.854\nGosh, I don't know how far it goes back,\nmight go back at least as far as Windows\n\n36\n00:01:47.854 --> 00:01:50.605\n95, and that's something\nknown as the Event Viewer.\n\n37\n00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:53.377\nThe Event Viewer is where we\nessentially audit the system.\n\n38\n00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:56.358\nAnd now if you're not aware\nof what auditing means,\n\n39\n00:01:56.358 --> 00:01:58.474\nit's really tracking activities.\n\n40\n00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:02.552\nAnd when we look at what activities we're\ntracking, we're tracking things like\n\n41\n00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:05.806\nsystem activities,\nwe're tracking application activities,\n\n42\n00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:09.254\nsecurity-related activities as\nwell as user activities, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:12.373\nThings like users logging on to\nthe machine, users logging off,\n\n44\n00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:14.769\nwhat are they doing when\nthey're on the machine?\n\n45\n00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.049\nAre they launching a certain program,\nand if they're accessing a file, right?\n\n46\n00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.442\nMaybe for security purposes you wanna know\nwhen somebody is accessing a resource\n\n47\n00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:28.109\nwithing the operating system, as well as\nwhen applications and services run, too.\n\n48\n00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.362\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's look at Event Viewer here.\n\n49\n00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:32.437\nSo I've got a Windows 7 machine and\n\n50\n00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:36.255\nreally when it comes to any of these\nwe could do this on Windows 7.\n\n51\n00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:40.766\nWe could do this on Windows 8.1 or\nVista, and it would really be the same.\n\n52\n00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:44.133\nSo let's go ahead and let's take a look\nat our Windows 7 machine here, and\n\n53\n00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.705\nthere are a few different ways\nthat you could get to this.\n\n54\n00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:49.916\nWhen it comes to Event Viewer,\nyou could always go to the Start button.\n\n55\n00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:55.004\nYou could go to Control panel,\nyou can go into your System and Security.\n\n56\n00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.355\nRemember, System and Maintenance,\nif you're inside of this, this System and\n\n57\n00:02:58.355 --> 00:02:59.897\nSecurity for Windows 7 and beyond.\n\n58\n00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.797\nAnd then we have the Administrative Tools.\n\n59\n00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:05.645\nAnd in the Administrative Tools,\nwe have Event Viewer.\n\n60\n00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.235\nSo that's one of the ways\nthat you can get there.\n\n61\n00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.767\nI also wanna talk just briefly\nabout what are known as\n\n62\n00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:11.438\nMicrosoft Management Consoles,\n\n63\n00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:14.215\nbecause they do call out some\nof the run-line commands.\n\n64\n00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:17.631\nAnd we'll talk about it in the next\nepisode [LAUGH], more about some\n\n65\n00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:21.474\nof the run-line commands, but\nsince we're talking about Event Viewer,\n\n66\n00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:25.518\nit isn't gonna be in that episode, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and mention it here.\n\n67\n00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:29.922\nAnd there was other ways that people\nwould access different programs within\n\n68\n00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:33.908\nthe operating system, and\nyou could use the, what was known as the,\n\n69\n00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:36.687\nnot the Control Panel,\nlet's try that again.\n\n70\n00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:39.575\nThe traditional run-line commands, right?\n\n71\n00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:44.356\nAnd this little Run operation will allow\nyou, if you knew exactly what the program\n\n72\n00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.947\nwas and how to enter the run-line command,\nyou could find different things.\n\n73\n00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:53.582\nSo we can do things like events,\nI think it's vwr.msc.\n\n74\n00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:56.259\nAnd we can choose OK to that.\n\n75\n00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:01.551\nAnd if you type it right then the\nappropriate Microsoft Management Console\n\n76\n00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:05.590\nwill come up and that's what the MS,\nwhat is it, MSC is.\n\n77\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.911\nIt's a Microsoft Management Console there,\nand\n\n78\n00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:11.457\nthere's plenty of these within\nthe operating system that are pre-built.\n\n79\n00:04:11.457 --> 00:04:13.738\nIn another episode,\nthe next episode coming up,\n\n80\n00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:17.505\nwe'll talk about more specifically blank\nMMCs that allow you to customize them.\n\n81\n00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:20.298\nSo I want you to know that,\nthe run-line command and\n\n82\n00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:23.482\nwe're gonna talk more about\nthe other ones here coming up.\n\n83\n00:04:23.482 --> 00:04:25.679\nBut for Event Viewer do remember that one.\n\n84\n00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:28.577\nNow if we're kinda drill\ndown into Event Viewer here,\n\n85\n00:04:28.577 --> 00:04:31.042\nyou'll see that we've\ngot a couple of notes.\n\n86\n00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:35.152\nLet's talk just briefly about some of\nthese administrative tools that you can\n\n87\n00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:37.705\nsee so\nthat you guys aren't flying blind here and\n\n88\n00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.960\nunderstand what the heck is going on here.\n\n89\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.317\nSometimes they call these nodes over here.\n\n90\n00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:46.891\nThey say expand out the Event Viewer node\nor the Windows logs if you will, and\n\n91\n00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:50.845\nthen you typically get some kind\nof hierarchical tree over here.\n\n92\n00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:53.907\nAnd then in the middle you have\nwhat's known as a context pane.\n\n93\n00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:55.120\nThe context pane, again,\n\n94\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.303\nis gonna be in context of anything\nyou select from the left-hand side.\n\n95\n00:04:58.303 --> 00:05:00.215\nSo if you notice if I select Application,\n\n96\n00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:03.494\nnotice how it changed a little bit over\nhere versus if I have Event Viewer\n\n97\n00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:05.972\nselected notice how\nthe context pane changes again.\n\n98\n00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.661\nAnd that's very, I mean that's just common\n\n99\n00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:13.133\nacross all the Microsoft management\nconsoles or utilities that you have.\n\n100\n00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:14.882\nSo be aware of that.\n\n101\n00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:17.367\nIf you're following along at home,\nif you're using our labs.\n\n102\n00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:20.386\nYou select something and you're like\nWes I'm not seeing what you're seeing.\n\n103\n00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:23.650\nJust make sure that you are in the right\ncontext over here in the left hand side.\n\n104\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.135\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, for just strictly purposes of\nthe exam, I notice that you had a ton of\n\n105\n00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:32.354\ndifferent types of events that were\nover there on your left-hand side.\n\n106\n00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:34.519\nIs that something we're gonna\nneed to be familiar with?\n\n107\n00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.304\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's a great question,\n\n108\n00:05:36.304 --> 00:05:38.844\ncuz there's three of them\nthat I would really know.\n\n109\n00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:42.183\nSome of these are custom logs,\ncustom views, and stuff, right?\n\n110\n00:05:42.183 --> 00:05:44.018\nBecause, again,\nyou can really customize them.\n\n111\n00:05:44.018 --> 00:05:46.994\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthis console one more time there.\n\n112\n00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:50.581\nNotice that there are some customized\nviews, but Dan, more importantly to your\n\n113\n00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:53.443\npoint here, yes there are, and\nthis is under the Windows Logs.\n\n114\n00:05:53.443 --> 00:05:56.167\nRemember we were talking about things\nlike tracking system activities?\n\n115\n00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:59.088\nThere are three that have been\naround here for a long time, and\n\n116\n00:05:59.088 --> 00:06:02.177\nkinda consistent across all\ndifferent versions of Windows, and\n\n117\n00:06:02.177 --> 00:06:04.497\nthat's Application, Security, and System.\n\n118\n00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:06.299\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about that.\n\n119\n00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.685\nSo Dan said hey,\nI noticed when you selected one of those,\n\n120\n00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:10.355\nman you had some different events here.\n\n121\n00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:12.637\nLet's show you what he means there, right?\n\n122\n00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:14.595\nSo if I select Application,\n\n123\n00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:18.845\nApplication is a series of logs\nif you will of events, right?\n\n124\n00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.422\nTracking events that happened\nrelated to applications\n\n125\n00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:23.567\nthat are running on your machine,\nall right?\n\n126\n00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:26.582\nNow, some of these applications\ncan be run by a user,\n\n127\n00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:30.736\nsometimes they could be run in\nthe background by a service that, really,\n\n128\n00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:33.961\nyou're not really directly\ninteracting with, right?\n\n129\n00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:38.417\nUnlike something like let's say an\napplication where maybe I go to the Start\n\n130\n00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:40.795\nmenu and I want to fire up Paint, right?\n\n131\n00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:43.250\nWell, this is an application\nthat I am running and\n\n132\n00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.709\nI'm running it in the context\nof my user account.\n\n133\n00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:49.824\nHowever, you will see that there are some\nof these that are actually loaded by\n\n134\n00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:52.755\nthe system as well, too,\nthat run in the background.\n\n135\n00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:55.909\nBut the Events here that we look\nat have different levels, right?\n\n136\n00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:00.740\nAnd, we can track what these events are\nbased on the information provided here.\n\n137\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.811\nSo, for instance, I can see that\nwe have a series of levels, right?\n\n138\n00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:06.450\nNotice that I have Information and\nI have Error.\n\n139\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.709\nWell, there's actually Information,\nwe have warnings,\n\n140\n00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:13.807\nwe have errors, and then we have critical.\n\n141\n00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:17.525\nAnd based on the severity\nof them really will define\n\n142\n00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:19.862\nwhat level of event it might be.\n\n143\n00:07:19.862 --> 00:07:23.630\nSo informational is exactly, or\ninformation, I just say informational.\n\n144\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.301\nBut Information is one that\njust lets you know, right?\n\n145\n00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:29.719\nIt says hey performance counters for\nsuch and such were loaded successfully.\n\n146\n00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.556\nSo it's just letting me know that hey,\nsomething was happening and\n\n147\n00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:34.210\nit happened the way it was supposed to.\n\n148\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.048\nAnd I can also see\nthe context if you will, and\n\n149\n00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:39.527\nit looks like I kinda went out of there.\n\n150\n00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:41.547\nLet's try that again, there we go.\n\n151\n00:07:41.547 --> 00:07:44.319\nIt also shows me the context\nin which it was run, so\n\n152\n00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.172\nI can see that the user is SYSTEM.\n\n153\n00:07:46.172 --> 00:07:48.553\nMy user account isn't called SYSTEM,\nit's called Admin, but\n\n154\n00:07:48.553 --> 00:07:51.242\nthere is a SYSTEM account in the\nbackground that is actually running some\n\n155\n00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:54.062\nof these performance counters that we'll\ntalk about in a later episode when\n\n156\n00:07:54.062 --> 00:07:55.668\nit comes to performance monitor, right?\n\n157\n00:07:55.668 --> 00:07:58.591\nI also can see things like your Event ID,\nand Event IDs are very,\n\n158\n00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:02.131\nvery Important when it comes to these\ndifferent events that you can see here.\n\n159\n00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:05.169\nSo, for instance,\nI don't know what the error is here, but\n\n160\n00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:07.030\nmaybe I wanna know what the error is.\n\n161\n00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.420\nSo that error event tells me\nsomething's gone wrong, right?\n\n162\n00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.338\nSo this is a little bit more higher up,\nright?\n\n163\n00:08:13.338 --> 00:08:16.745\nIn its criticality-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:17.247\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know if\n\n165\n00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:17.786\nI can say that right.\n\n166\n00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:21.266\n[LAUGH] But it's letting me know that\nthere was some kind of query here and\n\n167\n00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:25.094\nhonestly ladies and gentleman I have no\nclue what this is, but it's telling me\n\n168\n00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:29.020\nsomething to do with the processor, and\nI can see that there's an event ID.\n\n169\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.420\nSo I don't understand what this is,\nwell guess what,\n\n170\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.890\nI've got a couple of options right?\n\n171\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.783\nI can use the event log online help.\n\n172\n00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:38.230\nOr what we like to do here\nin administration and\n\n173\n00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.433\nDan I'm sure you've had to do this plenty\nof times in your work in the industry,\n\n174\n00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:44.281\nI don't know what the event id is.\n\n175\n00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.929\nWell it's time to go to Google, right\nit's time to fire up your web browser and\n\n176\n00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:51.413\nput event ID, such and such and a lot of\ntimes you can get not just the general\n\n177\n00:08:51.413 --> 00:08:53.710\ndetails or the general information.\n\n178\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.490\nYou can get potentially some things\nthat you could do to fix it, so\n\n179\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.540\nthe event IDs are very important and\nthe source is important.\n\n180\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.020\nIn this case its source is WMI and\nI just kind of know what that is in\n\n181\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.930\nthe background, that's some kind of\nWindows Management Instrumentation and\n\n182\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.560\nsince it's a query it tells me that\nWindows Management Instrumentation is\n\n183\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.790\ntrying to ask the operating system for\nsome information.\n\n184\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.410\nAnd unfortunately, for whatever reason,\nit isn't happening here.\n\n185\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.530\nSo these are great, Dan.\n\n186\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.090\nAnd again,\ncontinuing on with your question,\n\n187\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.010\napplications are one of the logs that\nyou definitely should know on the exam.\n\n188\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.670\nKnow exactly how to get\nto them in Event Viewer.\n\n189\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.340\nAnd also know the different levels, right?\n\n190\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.614\nOne of the great things I like,\n\n191\n00:09:34.614 --> 00:09:37.610\nthis is called the Action Pane in\nthese Management Consoles right here.\n\n192\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.330\nSo I could do a couple of things, right?\n\n193\n00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.200\nFor instance,\nI could go up to Action here and\n\n194\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.510\nI could do all of these\nactions right here.\n\n195\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.556\nBut with these Management Consoles,\nyou can also do them right here as well,\n\n196\n00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:51.750\nwhich is really nice.\n\n197\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.610\nAnd one of the things I like to do,\nso I like to filter the logs here.\n\n198\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.710\nYou'll notice that there's\nthis Filter Current Log, so\n\n199\n00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.320\nmaybe I am looking for application logs.\n\n200\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.752\nBut I don't care too much\nabout the information stuff.\n\n201\n00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:04.650\nThat's just let me know\nsomething's happening and\n\n202\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.110\nit's happening appropriately\nthe way it should.\n\n203\n00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.120\nBut I do want to find out\nwhen things are going wrong.\n\n204\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120\nWell if you'll notice,\n\n205\n00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.370\nI can find out maybe it's happened\nwithin the last 24 hours or so you know.\n\n206\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.010\nAnd I can filter this log\ndown by a certain time frame.\n\n207\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.090\nBut I can also filter it by saying,\nhey you know what,\n\n208\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.200\njust give me the critical events,\ngive me the error events and\n\n209\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.930\nthe warning events and let's go ahead and\nlet's just filter that out.\n\n210\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.450\nNow, notice that right off\nthe top I could see that there\n\n211\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.520\nare some things going on in\nthe background that could be problematic.\n\n212\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.800\nNow I don't know if they're problematic,\n\n213\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.000\nbecause according to my user experience\nright now, Windows 7 is up and running,\n\n214\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.800\nbut there are some times that things are\nrunning problematically in the background\n\n215\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.940\nand you're not aware of it and that's\na great way to be able to filter it.\n\n216\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.430\nNow keep in mind [LAUGH] that\nonce you have the filter on,\n\n217\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:55.670\nif you don't want the filter, come here,\nand clear the filter for sure, right?\n\n218\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.790\nAnd the great thing is,\n\n219\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.210\nthey do have a clear filter button\nthat makes it a little bit easier.\n\n220\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.080\nNow the second and the third logs,\n\n221\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.820\nand again, everything applies\nto this just the same way.\n\n222\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.730\nIs going to be the Security Logs,\nwhich these are auditing security\n\n223\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.910\nlevel events and\nwhat we mean by that is logons, log offs,\n\n224\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.120\nwhen a system account accesses a protected\nresource or a privileged resource.\n\n225\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.240\nIf you have this turned on to where\n\n226\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.270\nyou want to know when a user accesses\nsomething on the machine, accesses file,\n\n227\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.850\naccesses an application, well guess what,\nyou can track that as well.\n\n228\n00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.770\nIf you're trying to do\nsome security auditing.\n\n229\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.220\nHowever if this is the first time\nyou've ever heard about auditing,\n\n230\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.070\nright, sometimes people say I wanna know\neverything about everything, right, and\n\n231\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.890\nso they turn on every single\npossible type of log they can.\n\n232\n00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.730\nWell the Devil's in the details, if you\nwill, because the more information that\n\n233\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.650\nyou have, sometimes the less\ninformation you can find, right?\n\n234\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.550\nThat's one, right?\n\n235\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.730\nIf I turn on and I say, you know what,\nI want to find out everything so\n\n236\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.080\nlog everything,\ngive me all these different events, and\n\n237\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.890\nthen eventually what happens is it gets so\nconvoluted that you can't find anything.\n\n238\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.463\n&gt;&gt; It's like you're adding to the haystack\nthat you have to sift through for\n\n239\n00:12:04.463 --> 00:12:04.970\nyour needle.\n\n240\n00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.025\n&gt;&gt; That's right-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n241\n00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:06.916\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it seems like the needle's getting\n\n242\n00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:07.582\nsmaller-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:07.582 --> 00:12:08.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And smaller, and smaller.\n\n244\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.900\nThat's absolutely correct.\n\n245\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.100\nAnd the other thing too, is, these logs,\nwhile not too large in size.\n\n246\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.370\nAnd drives have definitely become\njust gargantuan in size and capacity.\n\n247\n00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.848\nThey can eventually accumulate so\nmuch that if you have a drive.\n\n248\n00:12:23.848 --> 00:12:28.000\nMaybe you've got a solid state drive and\nit's a relatively small solid state drive.\n\n249\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.060\nJust because of the price point on it?\n\n250\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.640\nWell, they can start to accumulate\nyour drive capacity and\n\n251\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.220\nactually cause performance issues.\n\n252\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.436\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n253\n00:12:36.436 --> 00:12:40.350\nGreat to have auditing, great to have\nEvent Viewer doing this logging so\n\n254\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.760\nthat we can find out information.\n\n255\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.030\nHowever, there's no reason to\nadd additional logs if you're\n\n256\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.660\nnot gonna use them.\n\n257\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.190\nNow if you're gonna use them,\nthat's great.\n\n258\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.060\nLast one, again.\n\n259\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.990\nI know a long kind of drawn out way here\nto get back to Dan's original question.\n\n260\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.590\nSystem is also very important, too.\n\n261\n00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.070\nSo if we could take a look\nat the screen one more time.\n\n262\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.085\nWe got applications.\n\n263\n00:12:59.085 --> 00:13:00.480\nSecurity,and system.\n\n264\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.660\nThose are the ones that I want\nyou to know for the exam so\n\n265\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.560\nthat if they do come up,\nyou will be prepared.\n\n266\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.522\nAll right.\nNow, Dan,\n\n267\n00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:12.027\nI know in a previous episode the next\nconcept they talk about is file structure,\n\n268\n00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:13.073\nand paths, right, and\n\n269\n00:13:13.073 --> 00:13:16.500\none of the things that we had talked\nabout is things like compatibility mode.\n\n270\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.140\nRight?\nAnd, how as we go through the different\n\n271\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.250\nversions of Windows,\nsometimes applications are looking for\n\n272\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.330\na certain file structure or\nfile path, and it's not there.\n\n273\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.080\nWell, I do want to expand\na little bit more on this, and\n\n274\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.570\nit's more so, so\nyou guys know in the background\n\n275\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.100\nkind of how the file structure\nworks in Windows, right?\n\n276\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.990\nSo if I open up our Windows Explorer,\nkeep in mind if you're in,\n\n277\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.390\nI'm gonna pick semantics on you here,\nif you are in Windows 8.1,\n\n278\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.980\nit's called File Explorer, but\nit's essentially the same thing.\n\n279\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.037\nWhat I want you to know is what\nthe file hierarchy looks like, right?\n\n280\n00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:52.590\nSo if we dig down into computer,\nall right,\n\n281\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.903\nnotice that we have what's\nknown as Local Disk (C:).\n\n282\n00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:59.870\nNow, those of you guys that are coming\nfrom the nix based systems, UNIX, Linux,\n\n283\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.862\nalready know this.\n\n284\n00:14:00.862 --> 00:14:02.890\nThis is what's called the root drive.\n\n285\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.630\nThis is the top part of the hierarchy.\n\n286\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:10.030\nEssentially file systems work like a tree,\na hierarchical system.\n\n287\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.950\nWell, that tree has to apex somewhere,\nit has to have a top point somewhere, and\n\n288\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.060\nin Windows it's typically C: by default,\nthe drive letter.\n\n289\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:25.810\nNow when we start to get into the hard\ndrive here, well, you're see C, right?\n\n290\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.330\nBoy, that's repetitive, right?\n\n291\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.410\nYou'll see C: here, and then the next\nthing that you're gonna notice\n\n292\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.360\nis you're gonna notice things like, for\ninstance, we got some performance logs,\n\n293\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.590\nProgram Files, Program Files (x86),\nUsers, and Windows.\n\n294\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.560\nNow, let me take a second here and kind of\ntell you a little bit about Program Files\n\n295\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.090\nand why do I have two\nProgram File folders?\n\n296\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.140\nWell if you have a 32 bit system,\nguess what?\n\n297\n00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.080\nYou only have one Program Files.\n\n298\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.860\nHowever, one of the things that the 64 bit\nsystem support are 32 bit applications.\n\n299\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.340\nKeep in mind that you have a 64 bit path.\n\n300\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.520\nRight?\n64 bit traces on your motherboard, and\n\n301\n00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.110\nit allows to compute 64 bits at a time.\n\n302\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.900\nWell, you can also run something\nknown as Windows on Windows, and\n\n303\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.330\nit's a way to emulate 32 bit.\n\n304\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.370\nIt just means you're gonna get\nhalf of the amount of information\n\n305\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.470\nprocessed by the CPU.\n\n306\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.104\nWell because of this,\nyou're gonna have 32-bit applications and\n\n307\n00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:16.515\nyou're gonna have 64-bit applications.\n\n308\n00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:20.425\nWell, all of your 32-bit applications\nfall under what's known as x86.\n\n309\n00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:25.423\nAnd that goes back to the days of the\nIntel's very first 32 bit processors under\n\n310\n00:15:25.423 --> 00:15:30.290\n8086 technology, right well even 6 bit or\n16 bit processors, right?\n\n311\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:35.320\n64 bit in Microsoft Lan and Microsoft\nlingo if you will is also called X64 but\n\n312\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.420\nthey know you're running a 64 bit\nplatform, they just call it program file.\n\n313\n00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.260\nSo 64 goes in Program Files,\n32 bit goes in x86 folder.\n\n314\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.637\nUser, Users, all right?\n\n315\n00:15:46.637 --> 00:15:47.613\nSo what's the Users about?\n\n316\n00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.902\nUsers are where all of your\nuser specific files are stored.\n\n317\n00:15:51.902 --> 00:15:55.047\nIt's called something known\nas call it the user profile.\n\n318\n00:15:55.047 --> 00:15:59.418\nAnd if I dig down into any one of the user\nprofiles, by the way Let's also note that\n\n319\n00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:02.173\nyou have to create the user for\nthe profile to exist.\n\n320\n00:16:02.173 --> 00:16:05.683\nSo since I haven't created any user other\nthan the first one that we used when we\n\n321\n00:16:05.683 --> 00:16:07.225\ninstalled the operating system,\n\n322\n00:16:07.225 --> 00:16:09.900\nyou'll see that the only thing\nthat we have here is Public.\n\n323\n00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.220\nNow Public is a profile that\nallows me to share files and\n\n324\n00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.000\nfolders with other people that\nhave accounts on this machine.\n\n325\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.920\nIf you'll notice here is what\nis known as the user profile.\n\n326\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.510\nIt's a collection of file or\nfolders if you will and\n\n327\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.340\nlocations in which it's\nspecific to the user right?\n\n328\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.290\nSo if I had let's say Dan had an account\non this machine and I had an account.\n\n329\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:38.030\nWe'd have a basically a C:\\\\users\\dan or\n\n330\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.170\nif it was my account we'd\nhave a C:\\ Users\\Wes.\n\n331\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.010\nAll Dan's unique files and folders would\nbe in his account, in his profile,\n\n332\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.360\nand mine would be in mine, right.\n\n333\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.830\nAnd if we wanted to share between\neach of those accounts, right?\n\n334\n00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.290\nDan could drop something in the Public\nprofile, and then when he logged out and\n\n335\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.540\nI logged in I would have access to it.\n\n336\n00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.580\nSo kind of a cool little way without\nhaving to know too much about\n\n337\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.400\nshared folders and sharing resources.\n\n338\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400\nWhich we're gonna talk about in later\nepisodes, that makes it very easy for\n\n339\n00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.630\nthe average end user to be\nable to share those resources.\n\n340\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I use to have to actually use\nthese folder structures quite extensively\n\n341\n00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.410\nin a help desk situation,\nbecause you'd have people that come and\n\n342\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.410\nthen they go, right.\n\n343\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.010\nWell that person that has\ngone maybe they retired.\n\n344\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.770\nBut they were the main person\ninside of that specific office.\n\n345\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.840\nThey had every file, they had all\nthe QuickBooks, this that and the other.\n\n346\n00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.990\nAnd of course,\nwhere do they save them, My Documents.\n\n347\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.330\nThey save them on their desktop.\n\n348\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.160\nSo when the new person came\nin to take their place.\n\n349\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.565\nYou can do some profile migration\nstuff within inside of Windows.\n\n350\n00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:44.522\nBut I found it easier just to give the new\nperson permission to the old person's\n\n351\n00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:47.539\nprofile, and\nthey can just browse into there.\n\n352\n00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:50.875\nAnd I would rename it old stuff,\nor something like that.\n\n353\n00:17:50.875 --> 00:17:53.270\nI knew exactly where to go and\nit made life a whole lot easier.\n\n354\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.383\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely cuz\nwhen you talk about,\n\n355\n00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:57.602\nwe've talked about Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n356\n00:17:57.602 --> 00:18:00.004\nThat's perfect for\nvery small organizations,\n\n357\n00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:02.800\nI mean very small like five people\npeople in the whole network, right?\n\n358\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.968\nBut if you work at a place like or\na company like Dan has worked in the past\n\n359\n00:18:05.968 --> 00:18:09.430\nwhere you have hundreds if not thousands\nof users, it makes it really easy.\n\n360\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.813\nBecause one of the things you have to keep\nin mind is that any of those files like he\n\n361\n00:18:12.813 --> 00:18:16.066\nwas saying in QuickBooks or any other\nkind of documentation that they have.\n\n362\n00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:20.270\nIf that person's account is deleted\nguess what, their files go with them.\n\n363\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.690\nSo it is a good thing to have access\nto this and we do something known as\n\n364\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.910\ntransfer ownership over to somebody else\njust in case somebody leaves the company.\n\n365\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.620\nSo, a very good thing to have.\n\n366\n00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.110\nNow, the other thing that we have to\ntalk about is something known as side by\n\n367\n00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.700\nside apps.\n\n368\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.510\nNow, they do mention category view and\n\n369\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.160\nthey mention classic view if you\nguys are following along at home.\n\n370\n00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.330\nWe've actually taken care\nof that in another episode.\n\n371\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:45.430\nRemember, that was more about how control\npanel was categorized or lack thereof.\n\n372\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.170\nWe can check out my screen here.\n\n373\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.760\nIf we go to Start, we go to Control Panel,\nremember that I told you in\n\n374\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.420\nVista it was still called Classic View,\nas of Windows 7, Windows 8, 8.1.\n\n375\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:02.070\nIt was a category or\nversus large icons and small icons.\n\n376\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.130\nAgain, they don't call it classic view\nbecause they don't want you looking and\n\n377\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.010\nthinking that they're\nkeeping around old stuff.\n\n378\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.500\nIt's just a different naming convention,\nif you will.\n\n379\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.515\n&gt;&gt; Stinking marketers!\n\n380\n00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:12.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n381\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.240\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n382\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.260\nIt's putting a new coat of\npaint over an old technology.\n\n383\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.830\nAnd this just allows you to not group your\nutilities in Control Panel based on more\n\n384\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.340\nof a categorization on\ntheir functionality.\n\n385\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.600\nAnd like Dan already mentioned,\nhe likes this view because hey,\n\n386\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.850\nI know exactly where every utility is.\n\n387\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.740\nI don't go to the door,\nunlock a door to find another locked door,\n\n388\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.600\nto finally get to where, let's say,\nadministrative tools, right?\n\n389\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.520\nNow, it's alphabetized,\nand I can get right there.\n\n390\n00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.460\nI know exactly where\nadministrative tools are.\n\n391\n00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.900\n&gt;&gt; That right, I love this view.\n\n392\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.640\nIt's definitely mine.\n\n393\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.540\nI actually insulted somebody one time.\n\n394\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.360\nAccidentally, because they were\nlooking for one of the icons.\n\n395\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.780\nThey had this view up.\n\n396\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.910\nAnd I say, it's in alphabetical order,\nI know, and I'm like, yeah,\n\n397\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.613\nokay I didn't know if you knew.\n\n398\n00:19:55.613 --> 00:19:57.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me expand on that because I know\n\n399\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.360\nyou've worked extensively in help desk.\n\n400\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.100\nThat is a great point to make for\nyour exam.\n\n401\n00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.400\nI don't know which one they're\ngonna ask you, so know both, right?\n\n402\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.490\nBecause if you're in\na help desk scenario or\n\n403\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.570\nsituation, a lot of times\nyour average end user.\n\n404\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.700\nThey couldn't care less\nwhich view it is cause\n\n405\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.035\na lot of times they don't\neven go to this location.\n\n406\n00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:20.500\nAdmins like Dan did was dealing with,\n\n407\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.040\nI mean that's the swimming\npool he swam in, right?\n\n408\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.020\nSo he knows how to modify that.\n\n409\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.680\nSo I'm glad that you brought that up\nbecause I do want to make mention of that.\n\n410\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.120\nKnow both views, right?\n\n411\n00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.990\nBecause they might ask you on\nthe exam to give you an answer and\n\n412\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.670\nyou're looking at the text and\nthat's all you have.\n\n413\n00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.220\nYou don't have an exhibit, or a view,\n\n414\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.030\nand you're gonna have to know,\nI need to go to start button.\n\n415\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.430\nI need to go to control panel.\n\n416\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.860\nI need to go to system and security.\n\n417\n00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.580\nScroll all the way down\nto administrative tools.\n\n418\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.530\nVersus just start control panel\nadministrative tools which for\n\n419\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.190\nus would be a lot easier [LAUGH].\n\n420\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.380\n&gt;&gt; You ever see a step by step with\nscreenshots throughout the step by\n\n421\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.480\nstep to try to help you?\n\n422\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.290\nYou need to build those\nscreenshots in your brain.\n\n423\n00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes absolutely.\n\n424\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.000\n&gt;&gt; So that you can like okay we're\ngoing to go to classic view.\n\n425\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.220\nI'm in classic view.\n\n426\n00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.210\nIt looks like this and\nyou're already going up in your head.\n\n427\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.300\nAnd there's a little screenshot\nin your brain that looks so\n\n428\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.320\nyou can see it, per se.\n\n429\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.110\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nthat is a great piece of advice.\n\n430\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.790\nBecause, that's what they are going\nto want you to prove that\n\n431\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.930\nyou can do on the exam.\n\n432\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.220\nSo definitely, take heed, for sure.\n\n433\n00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.870\nNow another thing they call\nout is side by side apps.\n\n434\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.230\nThis is something that's actually been\naround in the GUI for a long time.\n\n435\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:29.140\nBut I wanna expand a little bit more on it\ncuz what I believe that in the objectives\n\n436\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.910\nthey're going for\n\n437\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.760\nis a feature that was brought around\nin Windows 7 called the Snap feature.\n\n438\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.080\nSo let's go ahead and let's go back to our\ncomputer here, our Windows 7 machine and\n\n439\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.680\nI'm gonna open up just a couple\nof different applications, right?\n\n440\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.000\nWe've got our Windows Explorer and,\nreally,\n\n441\n00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.820\nwe've got another form\nof Windows Explorer.\n\n442\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.640\nIt just happens to be Control Panel.\n\n443\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.596\nAnd when we say side-by-side apps,\nwell you guys can see that, hey,\n\n444\n00:21:51.596 --> 00:21:53.410\n[LAUGH] these two apps are side-by-side.\n\n445\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.440\nBut look what happens if I drag one\nof them and I snap it to the side.\n\n446\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.490\nNotice that it filled up half\nthe screen and if I take this one and\n\n447\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.340\nI snap it to the other side, now notice\nthat we have the side by side arrangement.\n\n448\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.510\nWell, you could actually\nview your apps like this.\n\n449\n00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.130\nSo, again,\nthis is a really cool snap feature\n\n450\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.420\nthat you have on your Windows 7 and\nbeyond machines.\n\n451\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.370\nNow you can also modify the view\nby right clicking on the desktop.\n\n452\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:24.060\nAnd it shows you how you can sort\nby again, how you can view these.\n\n453\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.690\nHow you can auto-arrange things like\nyour icons on your screen, too.\n\n454\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.630\nSo there are some\nmanipulations that you can do.\n\n455\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.790\nIf you right-click on the task bar,\nyou can also do things like,\n\n456\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.100\nlet me go ahead and\nbring Windows Explorer back up here.\n\n457\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.550\nIf I right-click on the task bar again,\n\n458\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.290\nthe little strip that's across the bottom\nof the Windows Desktop, you'll notice that\n\n459\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.620\nI have the ability to show windows\nstacked, show windows side by side.\n\n460\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.780\nSide by side did exactly what I did but\nit wanted a different arrangement.\n\n461\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.580\nAnd it just kind of flip\nflopped them there.\n\n462\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.520\nBut we can also do\ncascading windows as well.\n\n463\n00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.940\nAnd, again, this, really isn't something\nthat's completely unique to Windows,\n\n464\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.090\nby any means.\n\n465\n00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:03.640\nIf you're in a Linux based system and you\nhave things like Ke, and Gnome or Unity or\n\n466\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.370\nEnlightenment or\n\n467\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.860\none of the many different desktop\ngraphical user interfaces that you get.\n\n468\n00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.690\nThey just might call it something\na little bit different.\n\n469\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.650\nAgain, it's not something that\nis not unique to windows.\n\n470\n00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.520\nBut know you do have that functionality.\n\n471\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.510\nAll right now that brings us into\nanother topic called the Metro UI.\n\n472\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.410\nI want you to know that the Metro UI at\nthe time the objectives were written was\n\n473\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:30.570\nthe current way to classify the Window\n8 and 8.1 desktop interface.\n\n474\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.880\nIt has long been changed\nas far as its name.\n\n475\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.300\nIt's called the Modern UI and\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n476\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.740\nWhen we look at Windows 7 here, you'll see\nthat I have things like the Start Menu.\n\n477\n00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.563\nI can launch applications\nall from the Start Menu.\n\n478\n00:23:46.563 --> 00:23:48.411\nWell if I go to the Windows 8.\n\n479\n00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:53.719\nI do have the desktop but I also have\nthis interesting tile interface as well.\n\n480\n00:23:53.719 --> 00:23:55.658\nWhen we talk about the tile interface,\n\n481\n00:23:55.658 --> 00:23:58.400\nthis is what's known as\nthe modern UI here, right?\n\n482\n00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.090\nIt was called the Metro UI\nwhen Windows 8 first came out.\n\n483\n00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.110\nBut when Windows 8.1 came out,\nkinda like Dan was joking around earlier,\n\n484\n00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.450\nthey renamed it.\n\n485\n00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.840\nAnd now it's called the modern UI.\n\n486\n00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.750\nAnd you have this tile based interface\nthat you can right click on any of these\n\n487\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.950\ntiles, and if you want to say I don't\nreally care about what the weather is in\n\n488\n00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.760\nFlorida, we know what it's gonna be like\nat about 2 o'clock it's gonna be raining.\n\n489\n00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.100\nSo I don't need to see that.\n\n490\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.550\nI can actually unpin it, right?\n\n491\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.470\nI can move things around if I want.\n\n492\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.800\nI can customize it as well.\n\n493\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.100\nSo, that's the Modern UI, or\nMetro UI, as it used to be called.\n\n494\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.270\nIt used to be called Metro UI, but\n\n495\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.190\nthe reason I kinda am playing semantics on\nthis is because I don't want you guys and\n\n496\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:40.910\ngals out there that are studying to go\nsay, man, I don't see Metro UI anymore.\n\n497\n00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.210\nAll I hear them talking\nabout is a Modern UI.\n\n498\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.090\nIt's just a simple renaming,\nthey are synonymous terms.\n\n499\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.260\nNow, speaking of UI,\nlet's talk a little bit more and\n\n500\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.630\ncompare it back to\nthings like our desktop.\n\n501\n00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.090\nCuz that's one of the things\nthat we've talked briefly about,\n\n502\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.970\nthe graphical user interface\nversus the command line interface.\n\n503\n00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.131\nAnd notice that this is your desktop,\nright.\n\n504\n00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:03.142\nThis is the main starting point for\nyou as a user, or\n\n505\n00:25:03.142 --> 00:25:08.540\nthe users that you're supporting, to\ninteract with the operating system, right?\n\n506\n00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.730\nI can move icons around here.\n\n507\n00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.120\nIf I want, I can do things that\nare really cool called pinning, right?\n\n508\n00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.580\nI can actually, if I wanted to,\nlet's say, for instance,\n\n509\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.980\nI wanted sticky notes, right?\n\n510\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.720\nI could right click on this,\nand I could say, you know what?\n\n511\n00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.450\nLet's pin this to the taskbar.\n\n512\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.720\nNow, what do I mean by\npinning it to the taskbar?\n\n513\n00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.750\nWell, that's part of the UI as well,\nright?\n\n514\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.620\nThe taskbar is this little strip\nof bar around the bottom and\n\n515\n00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.000\nwhat you have on the left hand side,\n\n516\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.460\nif I can remember what my right from\nleft is, we have the start button.\n\n517\n00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.630\nLet me get my Mac toolbar out of there.\n\n518\n00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.220\nNotice that I have the start button,\n\n519\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.140\nand we could do a little\nbit of hover to discover.\n\n520\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.990\nThat's one of the great things\nabout this type of interface,\n\n521\n00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.270\ngraphical user interface, is because I\ndon't really have to know too much about\n\n522\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.730\nhow to work with the operating system and\nall I have to do is take the point or\n\n523\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.010\ncursor, if you will, sometimes\ncalled the pointer and hover, and\n\n524\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.090\nI can discover a little\nbit of information.\n\n525\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.410\nNow if we move just the right\nof the task bar here we have\n\n526\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.990\nwhat are known as quick launch icons.\n\n527\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:10.450\nAnd the quick launch icons, notice that I\ncan take anything from the start button,\n\n528\n00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.890\nor the start menu, if you will, and I can\nactually pin it right to the taskbar.\n\n529\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.140\nNow I can also pin things, if you will,\nto the start menu themselves.\n\n530\n00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.660\nRight?\nSo again that's something known\n\n531\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.850\nas pinning.\n\n532\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:28.730\nYou can, so understand that's a basically\na way to customize either your taskbar or\n\n533\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.380\nyour start menu.\n\n534\n00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.000\nThe other thing cool about your desktop is\nyou have what's known as drag and drop.\n\n535\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.250\nNotice I have the calculator here.\n\n536\n00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.370\nWe'll maybe I'm gonna use the calculator,\nright?\n\n537\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.030\nSo what I do is a left click and\nI hold and I drag that\n\n538\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.890\ncalculator right to the desktop and\nnow I've got a nice little icon, right?\n\n539\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.310\nI've got what's known as a shortcut.\n\n540\n00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.800\nIt's on the desktop, and it allows me to\n\n541\n00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.180\ninteract with the calculator without\nhaving to know exactly where it is.\n\n542\n00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.580\nSo these kinda work almost the same,\na shortcut and\n\n543\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.467\nwhat's known as a quick launch icon,\nright?\n\n544\n00:26:55.467 --> 00:26:57.300\nGives you that one click, point and\n\n545\n00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.920\nclick functionality that we talked about\nin the first part of the features here.\n\n546\n00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.470\nNow my head's kinda covering it up, but\n\n547\n00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.830\nI also wanna talk about all the way\nover here to the right here.\n\n548\n00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.850\nThis is something that is, well,\n\n549\n00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.430\nit depends on how long you've been\nin Windows, what you might call it.\n\n550\n00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.680\nSome people still might call\nit the systray, system tray.\n\n551\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.750\nThey renamed it in Windows 7,\ncalled it the notification area.\n\n552\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.850\nIt's all the same thing,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n553\n00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.060\nDon't worry about that for the exam.\n\n554\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.370\nAnd what you can see here is I've got,\nalso, I've got some quick launch icons.\n\n555\n00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:31.080\nAnd what they do is they give me\nsome different utilities here.\n\n556\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.990\nI can see date and time as well.\n\n557\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.170\nAnd if I wanted to, I could change\nthe date and time settings here.\n\n558\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.020\nAnd we can do some manipulation\nto the taskbar as well.\n\n559\n00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.450\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could right click on the taskbar, right?\n\n560\n00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.050\nAnd I could choose properties.\n\n561\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.750\nAnd when I choose properties,\nI get a series of options here, and\n\n562\n00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.900\nthese options allow me\nto make modifications.\n\n563\n00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.360\nLike for instance,\nauto hiding the taskbar.\n\n564\n00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.240\nDan, I have to ask you this question.\n\n565\n00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.780\nIn your experience as help desk in helping\nend users, how many times did you get\n\n566\n00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.480\na call that somebody said, yeah I can't\nfind my taskbar anymore, it's gone.\n\n567\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get a lot of calls like that.\n\n568\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.990\nThat's gonna be things that\nyou have to deal with.\n\n569\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.280\nCuz people get Jiminy Clickit,\nthey start moving around and\n\n570\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.540\nthey accidentally click things.\n\n571\n00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.990\nThey hit a key combination that they\ndidn't know existed and then things go\n\n572\n00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.940\naway, and then the taskbar has shrunk\ndown below and they are freaking out.\n\n573\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.880\nI mean, to them,\nit's the end of the world,.\n\n574\n00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.440\nThe ground has opened up and\nit's swallowing them whole.\n\n575\n00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.010\nWhat do I do?\nIt's not a problem.\n\n576\n00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.555\nWe go in here and\nwe just make sure that it is checked or\n\n577\n00:28:29.555 --> 00:28:31.734\nun-checked appropriately\nto their situation.\n\n578\n00:28:31.734 --> 00:28:34.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right and\nthe reason I bring this up and\n\n579\n00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.660\nwanted you guys to hear somebody\nthat's been in the field and\n\n580\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.940\nhave to deal with that is because\nit very well could be on the exam.\n\n581\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.220\nThat's a commonality there.\n\n582\n00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.430\nSo you don't know, that might\nbe a little exam material there.\n\n583\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:50.840\n&gt;&gt; Things like that, auto run, that gets\nturned off or on and that freaks them out.\n\n584\n00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.418\nLittle weird things that they don't really\nmake changes to in their proper setting.\n\n585\n00:28:56.418 --> 00:28:59.480\nRight, maybe it was in a dialog\nbox that popped up and\n\n586\n00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.230\nthey clicked something accidentally.\n\n587\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.840\nYou've got to know how to get\nback there to reset that setting.\n\n588\n00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.354\nThis is one of those cases.\n\n589\n00:29:05.354 --> 00:29:07.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n590\n00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.820\nSo, know these properties, right?\n\n591\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.330\nAgain, because you are an entry\nlevel help desk technician,\n\n592\n00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.480\nit's going to be your\nresponsibility to help them.\n\n593\n00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.220\nSo I could also do things like\ncustomizing, for instance,\n\n594\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.110\nthe start menu from here too.\n\n595\n00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.880\nThere's a couple of different\nways that you can get to this.\n\n596\n00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.400\nI showed you ones of the ways is just\nright clicking on the taskbar and\n\n597\n00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.460\nchoosing properties.\n\n598\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.300\nYou can also do this from the start\nbutton, if you right click on the start\n\n599\n00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.560\nbutton and choose properties,\nnotice that it brings up the same menu.\n\n600\n00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.490\nLast but not the least if we push start,\nwe go to control panel, and\n\n601\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.650\nI believe if I remember\nright it's in appearance and\n\n602\n00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.300\npersonalization, I might have that,\nyep it is, it's right there.\n\n603\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.130\nI had to make sure that I\nremember it as I'm teaching it.\n\n604\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.700\nTaskbar and start menu, if I select that,\nnotice that it is all the same dialog box.\n\n605\n00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.830\nSo a few different things that, again it's\nspecifically mentioned in the exam or\n\n606\n00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.100\nin the exam objectives about knowing\nthe interface, so do be aware of that.\n\n607\n00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:01.880\nNow moving on, as we come to\nthe close in this episode here, there\n\n608\n00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.380\nare a couple of things that I want to talk\nabout, we've already mentioned pinning.\n\n609\n00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.090\nI want to talk about OneDrive,\none of the things OneDrive,\n\n610\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.710\nOneDrive is around for\nawhile called SkyDrive.\n\n611\n00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.960\nAnd it's an online storage solution that\nallows you to take your documents, your\n\n612\n00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.610\nphotos, music, if you will, and basically\nput it up into Microsoft Networks.\n\n613\n00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.030\nThey manage it, they maintain it.\n\n614\n00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.590\nThey work for making sure that you have\nbackups and you have access to it.\n\n615\n00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.300\nIt's usually a subscription based service.\n\n616\n00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.250\nSometimes they have\nthe free capabilities and\n\n617\n00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.610\nthey give you a certain amount for free.\n\n618\n00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.040\nAnd if you want larger amounts of storage,\n\n619\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.260\nyou're gonna pay them some kind\nof monthly service, right?\n\n620\n00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.510\nWell OneDrive on Windows 8 and\n8.1, and even in Windows 10 today,\n\n621\n00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:42.192\neven though we're not gonna cover Windows\n10 until the new objectives come out.\n\n622\n00:30:42.192 --> 00:30:47.100\nOneDrive, it allows you to\nstore your information that's\n\n623\n00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.910\nbasically integrates into the operating\nsystem, especially Windows 8 and 8.1,\n\n624\n00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.610\nthat all of my data can be stored\nup in the cloud inside of,\n\n625\n00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:00.060\nor from the operating system to\nMicrosoft's network over the internet.\n\n626\n00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.650\nIt does require what's known, they call\nit, here, they call it Live sign in, and\n\n627\n00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.830\nthat's back when it used to be\ncalled the Windows Live ID.\n\n628\n00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.446\nToday it's called the Microsoft account.\n\n629\n00:31:07.446 --> 00:31:13.507\nAnd, you can login essentially\nwith your Windows Live ID.\n\n630\n00:31:13.507 --> 00:31:18.102\nAgain Microsoft account is what it's\ncalled today, and gives you this single\n\n631\n00:31:18.102 --> 00:31:21.859\nsign on type capability where I\ncan logon to my computer with it,\n\n632\n00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:25.617\nI can synchronize my information\nwith OneDrive up to the cloud,\n\n633\n00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:31.050\nif I have an Xbox account, I can also\nlog into an Xbox platform, if you will.\n\n634\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:35.670\nAnd I can integrate all of that\nfunctionality into a single logon and\n\n635\n00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.270\nsingle capabilities.\n\n636\n00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.496\nWhich also brings me to something\nknown as the Windows Store.\n\n637\n00:31:39.496 --> 00:31:43.334\nIf we look at my computer here, the\nWindows 8.1 machine, you might notice in\n\n638\n00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:46.620\nthe background here we've got\na couple of ads that are going along.\n\n639\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.355\nThis is the Windows Store icon,\nand if I launch.\n\n640\n00:31:49.355 --> 00:31:53.382\nIt's gonna tell me my screen resolution's\na little bit too low for this one.\n\n641\n00:31:53.382 --> 00:31:56.050\nLet me see if I can bump\nup that resolution.\n\n642\n00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.050\nWe try to make sure that you guys can see\neverything real good here, but as you can\n\n643\n00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:05.030\nsee, or I guess, can't see, there is\na certain requirement for the resolution.\n\n644\n00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:09.580\nYeah, I'll tell you what, you'll just have\nto take my word on this as we go through\n\n645\n00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:15.140\nour additional, different episodes here.\n\n646\n00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.807\nWe'll look a little bit\nmore at the Windows Store.\n\n647\n00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:17.497\nAnd again,\n\n648\n00:32:17.497 --> 00:32:21.780\nit's because it is telling me that\nthe resolution is too low to view this.\n\n649\n00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.994\nHowever, I will tell you, that the\nWindows Store essentially is kinda like,\n\n650\n00:32:24.994 --> 00:32:26.173\nyou have in mobile devices.\n\n651\n00:32:26.173 --> 00:32:30.265\nYou have your mobile platforms,\nlike you have Google Play, if you will.\n\n652\n00:32:30.265 --> 00:32:35.625\nYou have the Amazon Appstore, in Apple,\nthey have the App Store as well.\n\n653\n00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:40.360\nIt's basically your online store for\ngetting applications that\n\n654\n00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.623\nbasically run on Windows 8 and\nbeyond, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n655\n00:32:45.623 --> 00:32:48.935\nIt does require that Live ID sign-in,\nif you will, or\n\n656\n00:32:48.935 --> 00:32:51.824\nwhat's known as\nthe Microsoft account today.\n\n657\n00:32:51.824 --> 00:32:53.470\nCharms, well, what's a charm?\n\n658\n00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:58.706\nAll right, well, let's go ahead and\nlook at our Windows 8.1 box here again,\n\n659\n00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:03.173\nand if I hover all the way over to\nthe right-hand corner of my screen,\n\n660\n00:33:03.173 --> 00:33:05.120\nall the way to the top.\n\n661\n00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.420\nI'll see this little sidebar\ntype functionality here and\n\n662\n00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.810\nthese are what are known as charms.\n\n663\n00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.190\nMy head's kind of covering it up, though.\n\n664\n00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.830\nIf I go to, for instance, Settings,\nyou can see that I get, again,\n\n665\n00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.550\na series of these icons.\n\n666\n00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:24.100\nAnd again, the icons called\ncharms allow me to essentially\n\n667\n00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.110\ninteract with the operating system,\nand that's what charms are.\n\n668\n00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.039\nAnd you can see some of the different\nones that we have available.\n\n669\n00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:34.879\nThings to search your computer, if you\nwill, share resources, devices, which is\n\n670\n00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:38.990\nkind of like Devices and Printers,\nif you will, inside of Windows 7.\n\n671\n00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.410\nNotice that we also have our different\nsettings, so we can interact with\n\n672\n00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:48.179\nthe operating system here all through that\ncharms menu, so realize what they are.\n\n673\n00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.300\nStart screen,\n\n674\n00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.920\nthe Start screen is actually that Metro UI\nthat we were talking about earlier.\n\n675\n00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.760\nSo, for instance,\nif I go back to my Modern UI, you'll see\n\n676\n00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.790\nthis is actually known as the Start\nscreen, hence the term Start right there.\n\n677\n00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.393\nSo this is our start screen, very, very\nimportant to understand that on the exam,\n\n678\n00:34:07.393 --> 00:34:09.459\nand which operating system\nyou would see it in.\n\n679\n00:34:09.459 --> 00:34:13.650\nRemember, you see it in Windows 8 and\nyou see it in Windows 8.1.\n\n680\n00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:18.291\nNow we also have a utility that's\nbeen around for a while too and\n\n681\n00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:21.193\nit's something known as PowerShell.\n\n682\n00:34:21.193 --> 00:34:24.654\nPowerShell is, I don't really\nwanna call it, I gotta be careful,\n\n683\n00:34:24.654 --> 00:34:27.158\nit's not a replacement for\nthe Command Prompt.\n\n684\n00:34:27.158 --> 00:34:31.590\nBut just like your command\nprompt is a text-based\n\n685\n00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:36.350\ncommand line interface,\nPowerShell is also there.\n\n686\n00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.766\nAnd so, for instance,\nif we take a look at my Windows 7 machine,\n\n687\n00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:43.324\nyou'll notice that I have two\ncommand line interpreters, right?\n\n688\n00:34:43.324 --> 00:34:48.196\nI kinda mentioned Command Prompt\nwhere you enter text-based input and\n\n689\n00:34:48.196 --> 00:34:52.060\nyou get essentially text-based output,\nright?\n\n690\n00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:58.230\nThis is essentially Windows, without\nthe graphical user interface, right?\n\n691\n00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:02.180\nAnd, in fact, I can show you that if I\ndo a little maneuvering around here,\n\n692\n00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.023\nlet's see, where do we wanna go?\n\n693\n00:35:04.023 --> 00:35:09.262\nCd c:\\users\\admin, and\nthen if I navigate a little bit farther,\n\n694\n00:35:09.262 --> 00:35:14.790\nI can go to the desktop and then I can\ndo things like working with Windows.\n\n695\n00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.137\nAnd you'll notice over here,\nthat in the graphical user interface,\n\n696\n00:35:18.137 --> 00:35:20.873\nessentially what I did is I\ncreated a folder, all right?\n\n697\n00:35:20.873 --> 00:35:24.311\nHowever, inside of\nthe command line interpreter,\n\n698\n00:35:24.311 --> 00:35:27.760\nknown as Command Prompt,\nit is called a directory.\n\n699\n00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.260\nAnd if I do a DIR, I can see that, hey,\nthere's that test directory I just\n\n700\n00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.300\ncreated, versus what I can see\nwith the graphical user interface.\n\n701\n00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.210\nWell, that's Command Prompt, right?\n\n702\n00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:42.215\nPowerShell, essentially,\nis the next generation of Command Prompt,\n\n703\n00:35:42.215 --> 00:35:46.151\nbecause this is also working with Windows,\nif you will,\n\n704\n00:35:46.151 --> 00:35:48.956\nwithout the graphical user interface.\n\n705\n00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:51.783\nAnd, again, you're doing things like,\nfor instance,\n\n706\n00:35:51.783 --> 00:35:53.587\nyou enter what are known as cmdlets.\n\n707\n00:35:53.587 --> 00:35:59.390\nAgain, it's a verb-noun syntax, get this,\ndo this, set this, if you will.\n\n708\n00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:03.124\nSo, for instance,\nI can do a get-command, and\n\n709\n00:36:03.124 --> 00:36:08.970\nit'll show me all of the [SOUND] all of\nthe different cmdlets that are in here.\n\n710\n00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:14.590\nAnd, again, you can see Resolve, then the\nnoun, Reset, so again, verb-noun syntax.\n\n711\n00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.230\nAnd one of the things that is\nreally powerful about it is that\n\n712\n00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.710\nCommand Prompt is kind\nof on the sidelines.\n\n713\n00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.591\nPowerShell runs right under\nthe operating system,\n\n714\n00:36:23.591 --> 00:36:27.911\ngives you direct access to the operating\nsystem, and it's a very powerful way\n\n715\n00:36:27.911 --> 00:36:31.531\nto automate functionality inside\nof your Windows environment.\n\n716\n00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:35.519\nSo know just a little bit\nabout PowerShell as well, and\n\n717\n00:36:35.519 --> 00:36:37.869\nyou should be good for the exam.\n\n718\n00:36:37.869 --> 00:36:41.378\nWe're gonna talk a little bit more\nabout some of the additional utilities\n\n719\n00:36:41.378 --> 00:36:41.951\nand tools.\n\n720\n00:36:41.951 --> 00:36:45.677\nBut we're not really doing it for this\nepisode because we really just wanted you\n\n721\n00:36:45.677 --> 00:36:47.798\nto know more about\nthe features themselves.\n\n722\n00:36:47.798 --> 00:36:51.224\nBut keep in mind, in episodes down the\nway, we're gonna show you how to use some\n\n723\n00:36:51.224 --> 00:36:54.900\nof these utilities and tools, so that\nyou can manage your Windows environment.\n\n724\n00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.819\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well, that's a pretty\ngood look at the Windows operating system.\n\n725\n00:36:58.819 --> 00:37:03.304\nAnd some of the requirements and\neven features inside of that lovely,\n\n726\n00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:06.734\nlovely thing that 85% of\nthe world actually uses.\n\n727\n00:37:06.734 --> 00:37:10.053\n[LAUGH] So it's probably something\nimportant you might need to know for\n\n728\n00:37:10.053 --> 00:37:11.693\nthe exam, and for real life land.\n\n729\n00:37:11.693 --> 00:37:13.574\nThat being said, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n730\n00:37:13.574 --> 00:37:17.250\nWe do thank you for watching, hopefully\nyou've enjoyed it and got a lot out of it.\n\n731\n00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.090\nThat's our goal anyway, everyday\nhere at ITProTV, but it is time for\n\n732\n00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.020\nus to sign off.\n\n733\n00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.370\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n734\n00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.118\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n735\n00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:27.214\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n736\n00:37:27.214 --> 00:37:33.256\n[MUSIC]\n\n737\n00:37:33.256 --> 00:37:36.505\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.995\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:13.835\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:16.786\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:19.766\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.390\nit is all about our A+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.610\nThat's right, get your mind wrapped\naround the software side of things.\n\n9\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.910\nSo that we can become a wonderful\ntechnician out there,\n\n10\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.380\nhaving a lot of fun and\nmaking a little money maybe even then.\n\n11\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.012\nJoining us in the studio to help us\nin that endeavor, our good friend Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:34.700\nWes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.370\nWes, welcome back, man, we're glad\nto have you, and how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.140\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.655\nGreat to be here and you know what's\ninteresting is we that started off in this\n\n16\n00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.727\n902 series with the features of Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:48.283\nAnd one thing that we didn't start off\nwith is how the heck do you get Windows\n\n18\n00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:49.380\non your machine?\n\n19\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.020\nSo I think we might have-\n&gt;&gt; You grab a Linux disk\n\n20\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.700\nand you slap it in.\n\n21\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.411\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n22\n00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:55.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually what I call a Windows\n\n23\n00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:57.162\nrepair disk, is a Linux live CD.\n\n24\n00:00:57.162 --> 00:01:00.115\nBut we won't go there right now [LAUGH].\n\n25\n00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:01.171\nThat's right, so\n\n26\n00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:05.534\nwe're gonna look at how we actually get\nthe operating system on your machine.\n\n27\n00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:08.771\nBecause in again, a previous episode,\nwe talked a lot about the features, and\n\n28\n00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:10.620\nthere were quite a few of them.\n\n29\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.930\nBut one of the things that we didn't\nreally discuss is how to get those\n\n30\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.250\nfeatures up and running when you\nare going to use the operating system.\n\n31\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.770\nSo in this one,\nwe're gonna be looking really at\n\n32\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.150\nhow to install the operating system,\nand we have quite a few choices.\n\n33\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.810\nWe have some choices that\nare beneficial in the home environment,\n\n34\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.100\nwe have some choices that are maybe not so\nbeneficial on a corporate environment, but\n\n35\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.810\nmaybe a little bit more beneficial inside\nof a corporate environment as well.\n\n36\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.920\nSo, what are the options that you have,\nand where might you see some of these\n\n37\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.660\noptions, and that is what we are gonna\ndiscuss here in this episode.\n\n38\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.450\nSo, let's go ahead and dive in.\n\n39\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.890\nIf you're following along at home,\n\n40\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600\nlike Dan says, the 220-902 exam,\nthis is going to be giving a scenario,\n\n41\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.440\ninstall Windows PC operating systems\nusing the appropriate methods.\n\n42\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.799\nSo, how do we know what the appropriate\nmethods are if we don't first know those\n\n43\n00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.394\nmethods?\n\n44\n00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:01.430\nSo that's where we're gonna start.\n\n45\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.450\nWell let's look at the boot\nmethods that we have, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.250\nSo what are the basics?\n\n47\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.298\nWhen we talk about boot method,\nwhat do we mean?\n\n48\n00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:09.665\nWell, if you remember when\nwe're talking about BIOS,\n\n49\n00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:12.990\nback in the hardware episodes that\nwe were doing inside of the 22901,\n\n50\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.250\nthe very first exam that you'll take with\nA+, we talked about the BIOS, right?\n\n51\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.320\nWe talked about CMOS,\n\n52\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.860\nwe talked about the fact BIOS allows\nthe hardware to be brought online,\n\n53\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.870\na quick test to self-diagnostic test\ncalled POST, right, power-on self-test.\n\n54\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.620\nAnd then the BIOS starts to fire off\nsignals that brings the hardware online,\n\n55\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.650\ngives it electrical current, stabilizes\nit, such as the power, if you will, RAM,\n\n56\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.949\nvideo, all of this.\n\n57\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.463\nThe last thing the BIOS does is it looks\nfor something known as a boot code,\n\n58\n00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.030\nall right?\n\n59\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.880\nNow the boot code is basically\nwhat allows the operating system\n\n60\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.810\nessentially to take over the hardware.\n\n61\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.110\nSee BIOS when it comes first comes online,\nit boots, it basically brings the hardware\n\n62\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.660\nonline and then it's gonna hand over\ncontrol to an operating system that's\n\n63\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.230\ngonna bootstrap, and then I can pass that\ncontrol off to the operating system.\n\n64\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.390\nSo, we talked about boot method,\nwhere does the BIOS, or UEFI,\n\n65\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.160\nI kind of use that term generically.\n\n66\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.120\nBut we have to be a little bit more\ntechnical when we talk about the A+ exam,\n\n67\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.970\nbecause it is a professional\nlevel technical exam.\n\n68\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.720\nSo whether it's basic input/output system\nor the next generation firmware platform\n\n69\n00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.800\ncalled Unified Extensible Firmware\nInterface, each one has to look for\n\n70\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.290\nthe boot code, the master boot code.\n\n71\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.360\nThat's where the boot methods come in,\nall right.\n\n72\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.310\nSo, some boot methods\nare a single one time location.\n\n73\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.867\nAnd what I mean by that is the BIOS or\n\n74\n00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:37.490\nthe UEFI finds that boot code\nin that one location and\n\n75\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.880\nthen the next time we reboot the computer,\nit doesn't find it in that location.\n\n76\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.680\nAnd I'll explain a little bit\nmore what I mean here coming up.\n\n77\n00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.880\nOther times you'll find that the boot code\nis found in the same location every time\n\n78\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.730\nyou press power on the machine.\n\n79\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.606\nAll right, so what are we talking about?\n\n80\n00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:57.540\nSo those single or one time locations,\n\n81\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.260\nyou might hear it configured in\nthe BIOS as a one time boot menu.\n\n82\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.790\nWhy might we do that?\n\n83\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.460\nWell first of all, when you don't have\nan operating system on the hard drive,\n\n84\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.080\nthere's no way that the BIOS\ncan look to the hard drive for\n\n85\n00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.890\nsomething that doesn't exist yet,\nit hasn't been written to the hard drive.\n\n86\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.234\nSo what we can do, is we can use,\nin the older days you can use a CD-ROM for\n\n87\n00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:19.812\nsomething like Windows.\n\n88\n00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:23.859\nToday you're not gonna fit Windows on\na CD-ROM, it's got a lot of bloat in it,\n\n89\n00:04:23.859 --> 00:04:26.720\nit's really big operating system today.\n\n90\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.520\nNow you can still use CD for\nthings like Linux Distros,\n\n91\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.660\nbecause Linux Distros are very,\nvery streamlined.\n\n92\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.340\nIn fact, you'll find a lot of\npeople that when they prefer Linux,\n\n93\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.560\nthey prefer to have the minimum on that,\nand\n\n94\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.870\nI'll get into what the format\nof an ISO is here in a second.\n\n95\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.880\nBut, on that disk, the minimum that you\nneed to get the operating system installed\n\n96\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.960\nand then they tailor make it and\ncustomize it to suit the needs or\n\n97\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.460\nwhatever the purpose is.\n\n98\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.570\nWindows on the other hand, and\nincluding things like Ubuntu, if you will.\n\n99\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.785\nI guess you could say Ubuntu is\nalso a fairly big operating system,\n\n100\n00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:00.280\nit doesn't fit on a CD, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.330\nSo you also have to use, well,\nthe other alternative, right?\n\n102\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.240\nAnd the only other alternative is a DVD.\n\n103\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.810\nIn fact, I got a little diagram here.\n\n104\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:15.000\nA basic diagram on my computer just kinda\nto show you why we would use CD over DVD.\n\n105\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.820\nWell, I want you to think about\nthe capacity of the optical media.\n\n106\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.050\nAnd again, we're not gonna go back\ninto the hardware, Daniel and\n\n107\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.180\nI covered that in 901 pretty extensively.\n\n108\n00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.929\nBut remember,\nthere is a limitation to the size of\n\n109\n00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.951\na CD which means you can't\nget Windows on a CD anymore.\n\n110\n00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:32.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like the CD is\nreally are horrible at storage there,\n\n111\n00:05:32.807 --> 00:05:33.967\n720 kilobytes.\n\n112\n00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.761\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or was it megabytes?\n\n113\n00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:37.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was supposed to be megabytes, yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.565\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was cracking a joke.\n\n115\n00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:39.898\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a step back to 1985.\n\n116\n00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:43.125\n&gt;&gt; That's horrible.\n\n117\n00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n118\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.460\nSo bad that, yeah, no wonder,\nit takes 15 CDs to get 1 meg on there.\n\n119\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n120\n00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:50.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n121\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.680\nthat good catch too, Dan.\n\n122\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.350\nI'm glad you,\nthat's why I got him here, man.\n\n123\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.132\nSo megabytes, right, so\n720 megabyte limitation on those CDs.\n\n124\n00:05:58.132 --> 00:06:03.326\nAnd because of that, well, you'll notice\nthat the operating system in Windows today\n\n125\n00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:08.760\nis, I wanna say it's approaching 3 gigs,\nif it isn't already there now, all right.\n\n126\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.980\nAnd what do I mean by 3 gigs,\nwhat am I talking about?\n\n127\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.323\nWell, I also wanna talk about\nthe DVD real quick, and\n\n128\n00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:19.024\nwe need to just briefly talk about a\nformat that I want you to be aware of too.\n\n129\n00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:23.317\nAnd that's why you can see today, if you\ndo have installation media at all, and\n\n130\n00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:27.782\nwe'll get into that, you're gonna see\nthat Windows has to come on a DVD.\n\n131\n00:06:27.782 --> 00:06:32.169\nAll right, that's because a DVD,\nit isn't limited in its capacity,\n\n132\n00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.427\nat least at this point in time in\nthis point in history as of 2017.\n\n133\n00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:40.638\nBecause when you look at Windows\nbeing potential of 3 gigs and higher,\n\n134\n00:06:40.638 --> 00:06:44.160\nit will still fit on a DVD at\n4.7 gig just on a single side.\n\n135\n00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.930\nOr, and\nyou don't really need this much but\n\n136\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.260\nyou can have a dual side of DVD that\nwill have 9.4 gigabytes in capacity.\n\n137\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.005\nAll right, now the other thing I want you\nto keep in mind is that when you do a one\n\n138\n00:06:57.005 --> 00:07:01.300\ntime boot, all right,\nwhat are you doing off the optical media?\n\n139\n00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.880\nWell, what your telling the BIOS is\nthat on that optical media is a boot\n\n140\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.641\ncode that allows you to essentially\nbootstrap an operating system, all right.\n\n141\n00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.780\nNow, I wanna talk about the file\nthat would be located, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.050\nI know I'm kinda jumping out\nof order here on my notes Dan,\n\n143\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.750\nbut one of the things that we have in the\nnotes is something known as an ISO file.\n\n144\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.765\nAn ISO file essentially is nothing\nmore than a container, but\n\n145\n00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:26.495\nit's a container that's\nkind of interesting.\n\n146\n00:07:26.495 --> 00:07:32.695\nA container that code all the parts that's\nnecessary to install an operating system.\n\n147\n00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.325\nI want you to think about something,\nif you went out to a store right now and\n\n148\n00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:40.740\nyou bought a dresser, and all\nthe assembly was required on your part.\n\n149\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.680\nWell, what do you have?\n\n150\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.210\nYou essentially have a box with\na bunch of pieces on it, right?\n\n151\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.540\nYou have to bring that box home and\nyou take the dresser out and\n\n152\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.240\nyou hopefully can read instructions.\n\n153\n00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.270\nI can't do that too well.\n\n154\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.352\nAnd you can put together,\nyou build cuz it has all the pieces in it,\n\n155\n00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:56.394\nincluding the instructions on how\nto put that dresser together.\n\n156\n00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:58.102\nWell that's essentially what an ISO is.\n\n157\n00:07:58.102 --> 00:08:01.600\nAn ISO actually isn't really\nan operating system, it's a container.\n\n158\n00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.936\nThat contains all the pieces you need\nto install the operating system and\n\n159\n00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:07.590\nget it running.\n\n160\n00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.920\nAnd that's what's on this\noptical media as well as USB.\n\n161\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.130\nLet me go ahead and throw USB in here in\nthe mix too because what you can do is\n\n162\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:20.670\nyou'd flash media, and you put the ISO\nfile if you will on the USB media.\n\n163\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.430\nAll right, so\nthat's one of the things to keep in mind.\n\n164\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:31.380\nNow I do want you to understand that these\nas forms of one time boot options, right?\n\n165\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.410\nAnother form of one time boot options is\nwhat's known is a repair installation.\n\n166\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.800\nAnd a repair installation is when you boot\ninto the Windows recovery environment and\n\n167\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.240\nyou have some kind of functionality\nproblem that error or something that's\n\n168\n00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.610\ngoing on, on an already installed\noperating system and what do you do?\n\n169\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.850\nWell, you do the same thing.\n\n170\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.070\nYou boot to the optical media or USB\ndrive in this case, and what happens is,\n\n171\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.170\nit loads a very,\nvery small minimalistic form of Windows.\n\n172\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.300\nAnd that Windows operating system allows\nyou access to the hard drive to try to\n\n173\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.516\nrepair it, all right.\n\n174\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.275\nNow you also have other kinds of single or\n\n175\n00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:09.540\none-time boot locations when\nit comes to boot methods too.\n\n176\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.070\nWe have what's known as PXE Boot,\nall right?\n\n177\n00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.890\nAnd that is the pre-boot\nexecution environment,\n\n178\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.190\nwe'll get a little bit more into that.\n\n179\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.400\nBut just know for now that that's\na way that the operating, or\n\n180\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.780\nyour network adapter can call out to the\nnetwork, and it can essentially say hey,\n\n181\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.930\nis there an operating system out there?\n\n182\n00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.590\nYou also have what's known as NetBoot 2.\n\n183\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.648\nNetBoot again, a way to boot off\nthe network card, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:32.648 --> 00:09:37.870\nNow you also have continuous\nboot locations, all right?\n\n185\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.972\nWhen we talk about\ncontinuous boot locations,\n\n186\n00:09:40.972 --> 00:09:45.554\nit means that I don't have to put\nan optical disk in the optical drive.\n\n187\n00:09:45.554 --> 00:09:50.220\nI don't have to plug in a USB drive.\n\n188\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.140\nI don't have to press a keyboard\nshortcut to tell the BIOS,\n\n189\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.450\nhey, boot to the network, right?\n\n190\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.780\nSome examples of that\nare your internal hard drive.\n\n191\n00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.370\nOnce you already had your\noperating system installed,\n\n192\n00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.080\nit puts the boot code in a sector of\nthe hard drive that it tells the BIOS and\n\n193\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.150\nthe UEFI system every time\nthat's where you go, right?\n\n194\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.080\nYou have other examples of\ncontinuous boot locations,\n\n195\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.940\nwhen you're doing multi-boot, all right?\n\n196\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.730\nWhen I have two different operating system\ninstalled on the same hard drive, or\n\n197\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.810\nreally, today, it could be across\nmultiple hard drives really.\n\n198\n00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.500\nBut your telling it, I wanna boot\nto this operating system once,\n\n199\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.330\nI shut the machine down, guess what, I can\npoint it to the next operating system, but\n\n200\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.590\nit is continuous location.\n\n201\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.780\nSome other examples too.\n\n202\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.410\nAnd this happens more in corporate\nenvironments than it does most really in\n\n203\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.340\nhome environments,\nyou have external drives as well.\n\n204\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.790\nAll right, or hot swappable drives.\n\n205\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.660\nAnd that's where you actually\ndo a combination of the pre-boot\n\n206\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.760\nexecution environment.\n\n207\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.940\nYou call out to the network and you say,\nhey, I need an operating system, and\n\n208\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.790\nit basically goes over the network and\npulls that operating system down off\n\n209\n00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.190\na network attached storage device, or\na storage area network, right, a SAN.\n\n210\n00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.782\nAgain these are external drives,\nright, these are hot swappable drives.\n\n211\n00:10:59.782 --> 00:11:03.619\nAnd they're hot swappable in the fact that\nif one of them fails, we can replace them,\n\n212\n00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:06.840\nright, like we've talked about in\nthe hardware section, all right.\n\n213\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.880\nSo those are a couple of\ndifferent locations, right?\n\n214\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.490\nWe do this in things like servers and\nthin clients.\n\n215\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.920\nAnd like I said, that continuous\nlocation like that on external drives,\n\n216\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.820\na lot of times it's done inside\nof a corporate environment.\n\n217\n00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.470\nNow I do want you to keep in mind,\nbecause we've mentioned CD-ROM, all right?\n\n218\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.720\nWe've mentioned DVD.\n\n219\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.100\nOne of the things I want you to keep in\nmind is that with both of these locations,\n\n220\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.000\nright, essentially you need local access.\n\n221\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.380\nIf I am going to use\nthese as boot methods,\n\n222\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.990\nI have to have physical\naccess to the machine.\n\n223\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.300\nWhy is that?\n\n224\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.377\nWell, l want you to think about it.\n\n225\n00:11:41.377 --> 00:11:45.032\nWhen l put a disk in the optical drive and\nl push power,\n\n226\n00:11:45.032 --> 00:11:49.583\nl have to tell the BIOS either\nthrough a configuration in the BIOS or\n\n227\n00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:55.540\nby key board shortcut to look to that\nlocation to install the operating system.\n\n228\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.570\nAll right, so\nit does require local access.\n\n229\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.150\nSame thing with USB device too.\n\n230\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.778\nNow you might say well, wait Wes, you\ncould just put the optical drive in it and\n\n231\n00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:09.550\nwalk away, right and boot the machine up\nfrom a remote installation source, and\n\n232\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.468\nI guess technically you could.\n\n233\n00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:14.239\nBut again at some point you need\nphysical access to the machine.\n\n234\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.940\nAll right, now one of the benefits\nif you will of USB right,\n\n235\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.580\nyou can use the speed of flash media and\nthat is a good thing, right?\n\n236\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.450\nBecause you have an optical\ndisk that is spinning,\n\n237\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.570\nit's going to take some mechanical disk.\n\n238\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.591\nYou're gonna have some kind of limitation\non RPMs that the speed that the device\n\n239\n00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:32.770\ncan move.\n\n240\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.010\nSo you could again, use USB.\n\n241\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.300\nKeep in mind that all three of\nthese methods are what are known as\n\n242\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.410\na decentralized model, and\nwhat do we mean by that?\n\n243\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.910\nWell I want you think of networking.\n\n244\n00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.889\nIn a home environment where you\nonly have a couple of computers or\n\n245\n00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:49.420\neven a small office, home office where\nyou only have a couple of computers,\n\n246\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.701\nit's not too bad, right.\n\n247\n00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:53.892\nI can go to one machine, I can start\nto install the operating system,\n\n248\n00:12:53.892 --> 00:12:58.180\nchances are I can just turn around and go\nto the next machine and I can install it.\n\n249\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.710\nAll right, now I picked on Dan throughout\nthis whole entire series because I know\n\n250\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.140\nthat he worked for a company that was\nvery large, hundreds of locations and\n\n251\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.830\nthousands of devices.\n\n252\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.507\nDan, would you wanna do optical media or\n\n253\n00:13:10.507 --> 00:13:13.685\nUSB installations across all\nthose thousands of devices?\n\n254\n00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:15.090\n&gt;&gt; Heck no.\n\n255\n00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean you'd quit,\n\n256\n00:13:16.881 --> 00:13:18.490\nit'd be too difficult.\n\n257\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.210\nI've done it, right.\n\n258\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.784\nWe've had to do a couple of\noptical installations, but\n\n259\n00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:24.180\nthat is not the standard\nformat to getting stuff.\n\n260\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.170\nIt's inefficient for a company of that\nsize, it would just not work out.\n\n261\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.170\nBy the time you got done\ngetting everybody installed,\n\n262\n00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.970\nthe new operating system would be up and\nyou'd be doing it all over again.\n\n263\n00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.756\nI mean I guess it's job security [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n264\n00:13:34.756 --> 00:13:36.458\nif you're getting paid\nby the hour it's fine.\n\n265\n00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Might as well right?\n\n266\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.972\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like mowing\n1,000 acres with a push mower,\n\n267\n00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:42.690\nby the time you're done you\nhave to start back over again.\n\n268\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.090\nSo again,\nyou can see that a decentralized model,\n\n269\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.340\nthat isn't really too good when you talk\nabout inside of corporate environments.\n\n270\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.727\nNow we'll get to some things that\nare a little bit better in a corporate\n\n271\n00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:53.263\nenvironment.\n\n272\n00:13:53.263 --> 00:13:57.890\nBut just understand, when we're talking\nabout those local installation sources,\n\n273\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.808\nlike optical media, and like USB media,\nthat is really just gonna be for\n\n274\n00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.530\nthe home environment.\n\n275\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.700\nIt's good for the tech bench\nwhen you work at a local tech\n\n276\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.360\ncompany where the people are just bringing\nin a computer randomly and says, hey,\n\n277\n00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.410\nI need to reinstall the operating system,\n\n278\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.600\nor you decide through being the tech\nthat you have to reinstall it.\n\n279\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.360\nNow I do kinda wanna\nmention another concept\n\n280\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.620\nthat I want you to be aware of too.\n\n281\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.427\nWhen it comes to booting your operating\nsystem, you have two different\n\n282\n00:14:27.427 --> 00:14:31.768\nforms of when we say temporary and\nwe can say permanent, right?\n\n283\n00:14:31.768 --> 00:14:36.020\nAll right, I got a little diagram here,\nand I wanna talk about this concept too.\n\n284\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.590\nAll right and its important,\nit's one of the concepts that I remember,\n\n285\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.220\nas I was becoming an A+ technician and\nI was studying for A+.\n\n286\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.050\nSome of the sources that I had, I didn't\nreally talked about it too much, so\n\n287\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.290\nI remember the first time I\nheard about a Linux live CD,\n\n288\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.560\nI was just starstruck, what do you mean?\n\n289\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.000\nThen when I heard about Win PE,\nthe pre-installation environment, or\n\n290\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.530\nWindows Recovery Environment, I'm like,\n\n291\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.080\nwhat are you talking about your\noperating system is running in RAM?\n\n292\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.064\nAnd that's before I actually\nunderstood that well,\n\n293\n00:15:02.064 --> 00:15:04.100\npretty much every operating\nsystem [LAUGH] runs in RAM.\n\n294\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.510\nIt just depends on if it's\nstored on the hard drive or not.\n\n295\n00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.190\nSo we have what's known as\nlocal installation, all right?\n\n296\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.529\nWhen we talk about local installation,\n\n297\n00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:16.880\nkeep in mind we're talking about\ninstalled on the local storage, right?\n\n298\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.230\nTypically your hard drives or\nyour solid-state drives but\n\n299\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.840\nthese are your internal drives, right?\n\n300\n00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.400\nHowever, we do have memory resident\noperating systems like a Linux live CD or\n\n301\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.350\nlike a Windows PE disk which\npre-installation environments,\n\n302\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.190\nstill Windows, but it only sits in RAM.\n\n303\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.485\nIt doesn't install itself\nto the hard drive.\n\n304\n00:15:34.485 --> 00:15:36.130\nLinux live CDs give you the benefit.\n\n305\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.921\nAnd I know we're not,\nwe're in a Windows section here, but\n\n306\n00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:42.265\nI'd really want you to understand\nthe memory resonant operating system\n\n307\n00:15:42.265 --> 00:15:45.525\nbecause it also goes over to leading\nitself to a repair installation.\n\n308\n00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:47.592\nYou have what's known as\nthe recovery disk, right.\n\n309\n00:15:47.592 --> 00:15:52.640\nAnd the recovery disk allows you to\nload up an operating system in RAM and\n\n310\n00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.368\nyou can run resets, you could do reset or\na restore installation.\n\n311\n00:15:57.368 --> 00:16:01.546\nBasically where I can rebuild the failed\noperating system on the hard drive.\n\n312\n00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:05.458\nNow, keep in mind that\nthe configurations aren't persistent.\n\n313\n00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:09.595\nIt gives me access to the hardware,\nit allows me to work with the computer.\n\n314\n00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:13.468\nBut the moment I push power,\nthe moment I shut the device down,\n\n315\n00:16:13.468 --> 00:16:15.380\nthe configurations are lost.\n\n316\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.270\nVersus a local installation.\n\n317\n00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.500\nKeep in mind that the internal drives,\nthey're going to be partitioned, they're\n\n318\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.300\ngoing to have active partitions that\nallow the operating system to bootstrap.\n\n319\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.300\nHowever, keep in mind that when you're\nusing your local installations like that,\n\n320\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.910\nthe configurations are persistent.\n\n321\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.510\nIt means that when I make configuration in\nthe operating system, they get applied and\n\n322\n00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.550\nstored on the hard drive, in this\ncase in Windows, in the registry, and\n\n323\n00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.189\nwhen I restart the machine, guess what,\nI boot back in to log back in to Windows.\n\n324\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.570\nThe list configurations\nare gonna be there.\n\n325\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.350\nNow there's goods and\nbads of everything right?\n\n326\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.350\nIf you look at a corporate environment\nyou might say, well, wait a second.\n\n327\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.440\nWhy wouldn't I want the configurations\nto be present, or persistent?\n\n328\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.420\nMeaning surviving reboots.\n\n329\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.710\nWell, I want you to think\nabout help desk situation.\n\n330\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.770\nIf you give your users the ability\nto always configure their desktops,\n\n331\n00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.423\nit is beneficial in the fact that\nit gives them consistency and\n\n332\n00:17:11.423 --> 00:17:14.090\nfamiliarity with the environment\nthat they're working in.\n\n333\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.046\nBut you also have a greater\nI guess tendency to have\n\n334\n00:17:18.046 --> 00:17:22.510\nconfiguration errors that\nalso survived the reboots.\n\n335\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.520\nWhen I have a non-persistent operating\nsystem that let's say we'll boot to a thin\n\n336\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.335\nclient, we pull the operating\nsystem down temporarily.\n\n337\n00:17:29.335 --> 00:17:31.316\nMeans it gives them the ability to do and\n\n338\n00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:34.511\nwork with their productivity\nsoftware during their workday.\n\n339\n00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:38.446\nBut the moment they shut the computer\ndown, we reset those configurations and\n\n340\n00:17:38.446 --> 00:17:41.950\nwe could potentially have\nless configuration errors.\n\n341\n00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.370\nBut there's good things and bad things.\n\n342\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.700\nSo understand memory resident means\nthat it's gonna load itself into RAM,\n\n343\n00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.290\nand once I shut the power down,\nit's gonna be gone.\n\n344\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.530\nWe do this with recovery disks,\nrepair installations, if you will.\n\n345\n00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.060\nWe do this with Linux live CDs,\nthin clients all do this as well.\n\n346\n00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.010\nBut one of your most common installation\ntypes is gonna be a local installation.\n\n347\n00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.810\nI do want to make mention of that\nbecause it's something that I know of,\n\n348\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:11.190\nme as an A+ student, I didn't\nreally understand what's going on.\n\n349\n00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.370\nTechnically you could say well,\nall operating systems run in RAM.\n\n350\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.580\nBut it's the fact that when I turn\nthe power off, that operating system and\n\n351\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.840\nit's configurations,\nare they still stored in the hard drive?\n\n352\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.190\nSo that leads us into the next\nconcept that I wanna move into and\n\n353\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.330\nthat's something known as\nthe Preboot execution environment.\n\n354\n00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.160\nYou might have heard me\nsay the term PXE boot.\n\n355\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.710\nAnd sometimes we call it\npxe because it's P-X-E.\n\n356\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.725\nPXE if you will.\n\n357\n00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:39.510\nIt's the preboot execution environment.\n\n358\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.458\nNow what is this?\n\n359\n00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:46.040\nWell the preboot execution environment,\nwhat it means is that like most\n\n360\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.090\ninstallations, they will start with what's\nknown as a preinstallation environment.\n\n361\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.640\nWindows just calls theirs WinPE, they\njust call it preinstallation environment.\n\n362\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.500\nWhat's a preinstallation environment?\n\n363\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.550\nIt means at this point the local\nstorage device doesn't\n\n364\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.080\nhave an operating system on it.\n\n365\n00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.970\nAnd at this point,\neverything's memory resident.\n\n366\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.910\nBut it usually means that you have\nan operating system that sits in\n\n367\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.540\nRAM that allows you to install and unpack.\n\n368\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.180\nRemember the ISO file that we told\nyou had to have all the parts to\n\n369\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.240\nthe dresser in it?\n\n370\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.570\nThe pre-installation environment's\na small, streamlined operating system that\n\n371\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:23.490\nallows you to unpack the pieces of the\noperating system, building the dresser or\n\n372\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.070\nbuilding the operating\nsystem that's going to\n\n373\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.860\nthen be permanently\nstored on the hard drive.\n\n374\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.910\nSo we want you to know that.\n\n375\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.630\nNow with PXE boot,\n\n376\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.770\nI got a little diagram here what\nkind of goes on it's interesting.\n\n377\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.250\nThe network adapter what it does,\nis it uses this communication by taking in\n\n378\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.490\nthe firmware of the network adapter and\ncommunicating with the BIOS,\n\n379\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.240\ncuz honestly it might not even be\na network adapter or card if you look.\n\n380\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.050\nCould be just the BIOS that's\ngot that network adapter\n\n381\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.230\nbuilt into the motherboard.\n\n382\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.270\nIt loads up a small, it's essentially a\nsmall protocol stack but you can think of\n\n383\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.370\nit as a small operating system that\nthen calls out to the network and\n\n384\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.020\nsays, hey,\nI need an operating system out there.\n\n385\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.560\nIs there anybody out there\nwith an operating system?\n\n386\n00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.190\nAnd then what happens is we usually\nhave a server out there, and\n\n387\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.155\nthis server will respond back\nto the PXE communication.\n\n388\n00:20:11.155 --> 00:20:13.785\nAnd it'll say, yeah, I hear you out there,\nyeah, you're calling for\n\n389\n00:20:13.785 --> 00:20:15.205\nan operating system?\n\n390\n00:20:15.205 --> 00:20:19.540\nI've actually got a boot image that'll\nlet you boot the operating system and\n\n391\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.489\nstart to install and it's located\nright here at my storage devices and\n\n392\n00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:24.262\nit starts to pass it over the network.\n\n393\n00:20:24.262 --> 00:20:27.400\nAnd then what happens is the boot image,\nif you will,\n\n394\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.890\nthat first part memory resident operating\nsystem and it loads in the RAM,\n\n395\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.440\nand then from there, communication between\nthe network adapter and the server, you\n\n396\n00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.950\nstart to unpack essentially the operating\nsystem and store it on the local drive.\n\n397\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.800\nIt's a very, very good feature to have.\n\n398\n00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.200\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nkinda show you one.\n\n399\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.000\nI'll show you what Pixie would look\nlike if you were to start this up.\n\n400\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.010\nSo I'm gonna go ahead And\nI'm going to start a pixie up, and\n\n401\n00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.348\nyou'll notice here, let me see if I.\n\n402\n00:20:57.348 --> 00:21:00.870\nOkay, am I going to be able to\npause this here real quick?\n\n403\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:06.171\nI'm going to go ahead and start this again\nand see if I can actually suspend this.\n\n404\n00:21:06.171 --> 00:21:10.009\nSo let me go ahead and suspend this\nright now so you guys can see.\n\n405\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.730\nNotice that what we have here\nis a network boot from Intel.\n\n406\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.200\nAnd this is the Intel adapter.\n\n407\n00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.980\nSo, what did it do?\n\n408\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.680\nIt calls out to the network and it says,\n\n409\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.000\nhey, I need an operating system,\ndo you have one?\n\n410\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.165\nHere's my MAC address so\nyou can identify who I am, and\n\n411\n00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:32.720\nhere's what's known as\na globally unique identifier.\n\n412\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.330\nAnd the globally unique identifier is\njust, it's interesting in the fact that\n\n413\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.020\nMAC addresses today we\nused to say well we got so\n\n414\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.220\nmany MAC addresses out there that you'll\nnever have to worry about a duplication.\n\n415\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.610\nBut with virtualization today\nthat's long since gone.\n\n416\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.630\nSo it actually uses the GUID to uniquely\nidentify itself cuz you can see how long\n\n417\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.670\nthis identifier is.\n\n418\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.120\nAnd then what happens is the server out\nthere, I just happen to be using something\n\n419\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.130\nknown as WDS that we'll get into\na little bit more here in a second.\n\n420\n00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:07.070\nThe server out there says yeah, I can\nsee you, you need an operating system.\n\n421\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:12.550\nWell, I tell you what you've connected\nto me and in this case if you push\n\n422\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:18.000\nF12 I'll go ahead, and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I will let you and\n\n423\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.010\nI will have to do it one more\ntime cuz I didn't catch it there.\n\n424\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:27.600\nI'll let you go ahead and I'll let you\nstart pulling down the operating system.\n\n425\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.290\nSo here's what is going on\nhere in the background.\n\n426\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.030\nNotice that I have\nconnected to the server,\n\n427\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.570\nthe server gave me an IP address through\nwhat we've talked about in other episodes.\n\n428\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.830\nWe talked about DHCP.\n\n429\n00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.380\nAnd then it's letting me\npull down this boot image.\n\n430\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.900\nNow the boot image is\nthat pre-installation\n\n431\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.680\nenvironment that we were talking about.\n\n432\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.740\nIt's gonna sit in RAM.\n\n433\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.620\nI get to make a choice.\n\n434\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.620\nIt's gonna sit in RAM and it's gonna\nlet me pull down an operating system.\n\n435\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.730\nNow, I didn't make a choice and\nthis is kinda,\n\n436\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.380\nthere's a time-out because you,\nand there you go.\n\n437\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.400\nYou can kinda see it loading\nthat that little boot image.\n\n438\n00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.170\nAnd what's going on.\n\n439\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.390\nWell, there we go.\n\n440\n00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.445\nNoticed that we got an operating\nsystem and it's being installed.\n\n441\n00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:16.990\nThat is a net boot or a network boot.\n\n442\n00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.010\nOver the network through PXE that is now\nallowing me to do something known as\n\n443\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.000\nimage deployment.\n\n444\n00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.820\n&gt;&gt; West, is this something that's\nmore prevalent nowadays to do with\n\n445\n00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.990\nthis way to have these PXE boot\nenvironment so that you can have\n\n446\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:32.380\nbasically a repository of images that\nare up in your network storage somewhere?\n\n447\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.020\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n448\n00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.830\nAnd Dan I'm sure you probably\nran across it a couple\n\n449\n00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.320\ntimes in the corporate environment.\n\n450\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.830\nBecause we were talking about that going\nfrom computer to computer to computer and\n\n451\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.780\nI do apologize with\nthe matted screen here.\n\n452\n00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.860\nI know it's a resolution isn't that great.\n\n453\n00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.130\nBut you can see that this\nis actually a deployment.\n\n454\n00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.400\nThis is what's known as image deployment.\n\n455\n00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.984\nAnd I get to interact with\nthe operating system.\n\n456\n00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:57.717\nI can tell it, hey I wanna use,\nin this case I use English.\n\n457\n00:23:57.717 --> 00:24:02.034\nAnd if you speak other languages,\nif you have viewers in other countries.\n\n458\n00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:05.239\nIt depends on the media that you have and\nthe same thing with your input method.\n\n459\n00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:09.270\nBut, Don, to answer your question here I\nhad to make sure I interact with this so\n\n460\n00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.530\nI wouldn't time out or select for me.\n\n461\n00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.220\nBut again, to answer your question,\nthat's exactly what I'll do.\n\n462\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.965\nBecause then what happens is, in\na network or in a corporate environment,\n\n463\n00:24:17.965 --> 00:24:20.646\nwhere we have,\nlet's say we have 100 computers.\n\n464\n00:24:20.646 --> 00:24:24.090\nAnd Dan says hey, Wes,\nI need you, as the tech,\n\n465\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:29.945\nI need you to put 100 Windows 7\nprofessionals on these 100 machines.\n\n466\n00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:34.145\nBut what I need is, I need a little bit\nmore functionality on these 100 machines,\n\n467\n00:24:34.145 --> 00:24:36.195\nand I need you to put\nWindows 7 ultimately or\n\n468\n00:24:36.195 --> 00:24:39.930\nI need you to put Windows\n8.1 Pro on there.\n\n469\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.190\nWell guess what?\n\n470\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.810\nWhere's my installation media?\n\n471\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.900\nI got these optical drives, let me go make\na copy of 100 Windows 7 Professional.\n\n472\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.561\nAnd let me go make 100 copies of\nthis DVDs, it would't work on CDs.\n\n473\n00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:52.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n474\n00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.160\nstring out 100 USB devices\nthen I'll go sneakernet.\n\n475\n00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.620\nAnd they'll plug the into each machine\nloading all of the optical drives and\n\n476\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.050\nthen have to come back through them and\n\n477\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.110\npush the one time boot menu and tell\nthe BIOS to look for those optical drives.\n\n478\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.530\nYou can see in a corporate\nenvironment that isn't feasible.\n\n479\n00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.530\nSo just like Dan said you\nhave a repository of these\n\n480\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.390\nimages which is essentially\nthese ISO files that we talked\n\n481\n00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.340\nabout that already have\nthe operating system ready.\n\n482\n00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.950\nYou pull down a boot menu.\n\n483\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.440\nYou pulled out a boot image, if you will,\nlike we're doing right here and\n\n484\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.050\nessentially you tell it,\nall right, I want to go ahead and\n\n485\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.610\nI want to image this machine.\n\n486\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.960\nSo let me go ahead and\nlet me log into our computer here,\n\n487\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.380\nmake sure that I can authenticate.\n\n488\n00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.246\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's fine,\nthis was the first job I had in tech.\n\n489\n00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:44.262\nWhen I began this was in 1999 and\nwe used Norton Ghost it's\n\n490\n00:25:44.262 --> 00:25:48.660\nSymantec Ghost now, and this is all what\nI did, all there was an imaging machines.\n\n491\n00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.220\nWe set up a small LAN\nusing a network switch and\n\n492\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.200\nwe had a server with the images on it and\nwe did this all day and\n\n493\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.970\npost configuration we'd set it out,\nand worked at the hospital here.\n\n494\n00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In Gainesville, yeah.\n\n495\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and don't let that confuse you,\n\n496\n00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.950\nguys, image deployment\nis image deployment.\n\n497\n00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.800\nIt's just the stamp or the brand\nthat's on it, it's the same thing.\n\n498\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.030\n&gt;&gt; There's many,\nmany different ones out there, Ghost-\n\n499\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.120\n&gt;&gt; Acronis is another one, Acronis, yep,\n\n500\n00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.736\nexactly.\n\n501\n00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:13.188\n[CROSSTALK] Symantec backup as one.\n\n502\n00:26:13.188 --> 00:26:14.564\n&gt;&gt; So there's a whole bunch of them.\n\n503\n00:26:14.564 --> 00:26:17.670\nWe just happen to be showing you\nWindows deployment services here.\n\n504\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.160\nIt is the same technology and\nif you'll look at the screen here.\n\n505\n00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.780\nLook what we got.\n\n506\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.660\nI've got all that's at repository\nthat Dan had mentioned.\n\n507\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.260\nI've got all of these different operating\nsystems that I could pick from.\n\n508\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Just basically pointing\nto a network share, right?\n\n509\n00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.180\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n510\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.310\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n511\n00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.900\nIt's just a storage location\nout there on the network, and\n\n512\n00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.880\nI could pick one of\nthese operating systems.\n\n513\n00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.320\nLet's just pick Windows 7 Ultimate, and\n\n514\n00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.850\nI could tell it yeah I wanna\nboot to the operating system.\n\n515\n00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.160\nAnd you can see that we start\nto go through a normal install.\n\n516\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.360\nAnd I'm gonna compare this\nback to a local install too.\n\n517\n00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.510\nSo if this is the first\ntime you've seen this,\n\n518\n00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.370\nI don't want you to think that\nit's too highly technical.\n\n519\n00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.990\nIt does require a little bit of setup.\n\n520\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.650\nDon't get us wrong.\n\n521\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.650\nAnd this is not something that you're\ngoing to have to do as far as the network\n\n522\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:05.200\nboot side, but I want you guys and\ngirls out there to actually see it.\n\n523\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.840\nI don't want to just talk about Pixie,\n\n524\n00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.910\nthat's not what we like\nto do here at IT Pro TV.\n\n525\n00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.150\nWe want to also show\nyou what it looks like.\n\n526\n00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.050\nSo now we're going through\na basic installation.\n\n527\n00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.810\nAnd I could do some formatting\nif I wanted as well.\n\n528\n00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.200\nAnd my head's kind of covering it up here.\n\n529\n00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.960\nThere we go.\n\n530\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.110\nAnd we see the next option and\nI go through, and\n\n531\n00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.880\nthen it says wait for the server.\n\n532\n00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.431\nAnd if I've got it configured,\n\n533\n00:27:27.431 --> 00:27:30.370\nhopefully I do [LAUGH] I got it\nconfigured right on the server.\n\n534\n00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.120\nWhat we're gonna see it's that\nit's gonna start the installation.\n\n535\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.780\nNow, understand that this is\nstill a hands-on process.\n\n536\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:46.050\nThis is still, again, I gave the example\nof a hundred computers here or there.\n\n537\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.135\nThere is a way that we can\na little further than this.\n\n538\n00:27:49.135 --> 00:27:52.845\nWe can do what's known as\nan unattended installation.\n\n539\n00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:55.815\nNow you do not have to understand\n\n540\n00:27:55.815 --> 00:27:58.685\nhow to configure some of these\ntechnologies that we're showing you.\n\n541\n00:27:58.685 --> 00:28:01.735\nWe just don't wanna sit here and\ntalk about them and\n\n542\n00:28:01.735 --> 00:28:04.535\nnot give you something tangible to see.\n\n543\n00:28:04.535 --> 00:28:07.815\nWith an unintended installation,\nnotice how I had to pick some things.\n\n544\n00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:09.815\nNotice how I had to log in.\n\n545\n00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:12.480\nI had to select an operating system.\n\n546\n00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.615\nThat's great.\n\n547\n00:28:13.615 --> 00:28:15.954\nThat's a great thing for\na remote installation.\n\n548\n00:28:15.954 --> 00:28:20.728\nBut would you like a way that you can,\nI know these 100 computers, I know what\n\n549\n00:28:20.728 --> 00:28:25.501\nthey need, I know what operating system\nthey need, and I just want them to reach\n\n550\n00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:31.200\nout to that server the moment they boot\nup and pull down that operating system.\n\n551\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.710\nAnd then when it comes to the post\nconfigurations that we're gonna show you\n\n552\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.570\nhow to do here probably at a part 2.\n\n553\n00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:39.234\nI don't have to sit here and\ndo the hands-on.\n\n554\n00:28:39.234 --> 00:28:41.150\nI can let the computer do it.\n\n555\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.360\nI can let the server and the communication\nbetween the PXE boot and the deployment\n\n556\n00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.590\nserver say, those are the settings\nthat need to apply to this machine.\n\n557\n00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.950\nAnd how do we do that?\n\n558\n00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.190\nWell, with an unintended installation\nall you're really doing is saying,\n\n559\n00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.550\nyou know what operating system,\nwhen you go to install\n\n560\n00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:04.260\nI also want you to pull down this file,\nin Windows we call it an answer file.\n\n561\n00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.450\nAnd instead of you stopping and\nwaiting for a dialogue box with human\n\n562\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:15.000\ninteraction It says you need the English\nlanguage or French or Spanish\n\n563\n00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.050\ndepending on what country you might be in\nand you need the English keyboard layout.\n\n564\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.670\nThe United States keyboard layout.\n\n565\n00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.650\nOr you might need the United States\nInternational keyboard layout.\n\n566\n00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.605\nAnd it answers those dialog box.\n\n567\n00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:27.630\nHence why they call it an answer file.\n\n568\n00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.130\nAnd it makes it completely automated.\n\n569\n00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.060\nAnd now when Dan says, hey Wes, I need you\nto go ahead and install those operating\n\n570\n00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.130\nsystems, 100 on this machine, and 100 on\nthese machines, and I need these settings.\n\n571\n00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.710\nI need them joined to\nthe corporate network,\n\n572\n00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.490\nI need them joined to the corporate\nnetwork over here, I can schedule it.\n\n573\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.420\nAnd I can tell this server that's\nhanding out the images when a hundred of\n\n574\n00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.850\nthese computers connect, pull down this\nfile and apply all those settings.\n\n575\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.840\nAnd we do what's known as\na zero touch deployment.\n\n576\n00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.410\nIt's called a ZTI,\nzero touch installation.\n\n577\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.960\nThis is what's known as a LTI,\na light touch installation.\n\n578\n00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.590\nIt means I still gotta get\na little bit interactive..\n\n579\n00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.750\nSo it's a great thing to have.\n\n580\n00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.020\nBut you know what?\n\n581\n00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.400\nUnfortunately, like again,\nI've only scratched the surface.\n\n582\n00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.150\nAnd I'm looking at my notes, and\nwe've still got a few pages to go.\n\n583\n00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got a little more info to\ncover for you good folks out there, and\n\n584\n00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.220\na lot of little time to do.\n\n585\n00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.080\nWe're out of time for this episode, so\n\n586\n00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.190\nwe will have to move into a part two,\nmaybe even a part three.\n\n587\n00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.510\nWho knows a part four could be on\nthe horizon you never know with this crazy\n\n588\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.640\nkook over here he can yammer on\nall day about some really fun and\n\n589\n00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.760\nexciting stuff though.\n\n590\n00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.910\nSo definitely come back for\nthat and Wes we thank you for\n\n591\n00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.460\njoining us today, looking forward to\nseeing you in the next episode as well.\n\n592\n00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.410\nIt is time for us to sign off for IT Pro\nTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.160\n&gt;&gt; And

ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.784\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:17.901\nwelcome back to another great episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.830\nIn today's episode we are continuing on,\nmoving forward, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.960\ntrying to grapple all that is A+, that\nis the software side of things to 2902.\n\n8\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.924\nAnd joining us back in the studio to help\nus out, yet again lend his expertise,\n\n9\n00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:32.585\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.690\nWes, we are so glad to have you back man,\nhow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.590\nGreat to be here as always,\nand that's right,\n\n13\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.000\nwe are continuing on\nin installing Windows.\n\n14\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.355\nWell in the last episode we talked a lot\nabout just some of the basics when it\n\n15\n00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:45.841\ncomes to installation.\n\n16\n00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.427\nBoot methods we talked about,\n\n17\n00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:51.698\nwhere we can find these operating systems\nas far as the installation sources goes.\n\n18\n00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:56.235\nAnd one of the things that we left off on\nwas image deployment, I wanna go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.666\nI'm gonna pick up right where we left off.\n\n20\n00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:03.330\nAnd I just wanna make sure that everybody\nunderstands the process surrounding\n\n21\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.380\nimage deployment, so I got a little\ndiagram here I'm just gonna kind of recap.\n\n22\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.747\nRemember, one of the things that we showed\nyou is actually deploying an image from\n\n23\n00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:11.707\nan image server.\n\n24\n00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:16.482\nKeep in mind what happens is that we\nhave essentially a PXE communication\n\n25\n00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:17.980\nthat goes on, right.\n\n26\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.638\nThe operating sys, or actually not only,\nwe don't even have an operating system,\n\n27\n00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:26.577\nthe network adapter through the BIOS or\nUAFI calls out to the network and\n\n28\n00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:30.278\nsays hey, I need an operating system,\nanybody out there got one?\n\n29\n00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:34.750\nAnd then it's the deployment server,\nright, doesn't matter what your deployment\n\n30\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.515\nsoftware is we mentioned a few different\nkinds, we just happen to be using WDS, or\n\n31\n00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.975\nWindows Deployment Services\nhere in the A+ as an example.\n\n32\n00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:46.525\nThe image gets deployed over to\nthe network to a destination computer,\n\n33\n00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:48.805\nit could be a series of computers too so\n\n34\n00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.645\nthat's one of the benefits of doing\nthis in a corporate environment.\n\n35\n00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:56.399\nAnd then the image is installed, if you\nwill, or unpacked to the hard drive,\n\n36\n00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.278\nkeep in mind that this is something\ntypically you find inside of\n\n37\n00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:02.267\nyour corporate environments.\n\n38\n00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:06.702\nNow image deployment isn't the only\ninstallation type that we need to be aware\n\n39\n00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:10.076\nof, we also have some things\nthat are specific to Windows.\n\n40\n00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:13.058\nAnd really we have what are known\nus upgrade installations and\n\n41\n00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:16.430\nwe have what are known as clean\ninstallations, all right.\n\n42\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.610\nSo let's go ahead and let's talk about\na clean installation, all right,\n\n43\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.230\na clean installation, first this is\nan installation type in which you have\n\n44\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.030\nno operating system already\non your hard drive.\n\n45\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.930\n&gt;&gt; Hence the term clean, right,\nthere's nothing on there,\n\n46\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.770\nnothing dirtying up your\nhard drive as it were.\n\n47\n00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.400\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct, and\n\n48\n00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.480\nwhat it means is that you're gonna format\nthe hard drive and you're gonna install,\n\n49\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.130\njust like Dan said, a clean, fresh\ninstallation of the operating system.\n\n50\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.530\nNow let me be careful on this because\none of the things that I kinda said and\n\n51\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.670\ntechnically isn't true is that you don't\nhave an operating system already on\n\n52\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.630\nyour hard drive, you could.\n\n53\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.080\nYou could have something,\nlet's say Windows XP or\n\n54\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.830\nWindows Vista already as an operating\nsystem and you say you know what,\n\n55\n00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.520\nI wanna move to Windows 8.1 but\nI don't need the old operating system.\n\n56\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.040\nI don't need any of the files or\n\n57\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.370\nanything like that, I don't need any\nof the applications, you know what?\n\n58\n00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.960\nBecause again I wanna do some screening\nand I want everything to be fresh.\n\n59\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.528\nAnd what happens?\n\n60\n00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:18.110\n[INAUDIBLE] you go through your install\nprocess and you format the hard drive,\n\n61\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.800\nyou repartition everything and then\ninstall an operating system over the old\n\n62\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.110\none completely eliminating all of\nthe old remnants of the hard drive.\n\n63\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.840\nIt's a clean installation.\n\n64\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.920\nNow that has it's benefits,\nin the fact that,\n\n65\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.350\nwell, that's why I kinda mentioned\nthe term spring cleaning.\n\n66\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.698\nI know here at IT Pro TV,\nwe like to do clean installations.\n\n67\n00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:43.020\nWhen we muddy-up an operating system, and\n\n68\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.620\nwhat I mean by that is you use it\nyou're making configuration changes.\n\n69\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.060\nI know we like to peak and\n\n70\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.920\ntweak operating systems kind of\nsee what we can do with them.\n\n71\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.670\nSometimes we can break them\nwith the best of them, right.\n\n72\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.522\nBut the thing is, when it comes\ntimes that you want to clean up,\n\n73\n00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:01.840\nthe hard drive essentially or\n\n74\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.840\nclean up the installation itself,\nwe just reformat the hard drive and\n\n75\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.570\nput a fresh installation of Windows or\nwhatever your operating system might be.\n\n76\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.440\nJust happens to be that we're talking\nabout windows here, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.270\nnow where would the drawbacks be right?\n\n78\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.090\nBecause it sounds like it's beneficial,\nwell here's the drawbacks.\n\n79\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.140\nYou got your applications\nalready installed right?\n\n80\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.970\nYou're in a business,\n\n81\n00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.840\nbusinesses spend a lot of money on\nthe applications that they have.\n\n82\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.430\nWell, when you go to a new operating\nsystem and you do a clean install,\n\n83\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.720\nyou're gonna lose applications.\n\n84\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.960\nAnd here's the thing, too,\nyou're also gonna lose settings and\n\n85\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.080\nyou're gonna lose any files\nthat are associated, right?\n\n86\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.310\nUnless you're keeping backups, and we'll\ntalk about preventative maintenance in\n\n87\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.150\nanother episode but keep in mind\nwhen you do a clean installation you\n\n88\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.290\nlose your applications, you lose your\nsettings and you lose your files.\n\n89\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.900\nNow here's where the other type\nof installation comes in and\n\n90\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.035\nthat's something known as\nan upgrade installation.\n\n91\n00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:57.190\nAll right, one of the things Windows\nallows you to do is that if you want to\n\n92\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.720\ninstall your operating system but\nyou wanna keep certain things.\n\n93\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.740\nYou wanna keep certain\nthings on the hard drive,\n\n94\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.670\nyou wanna keep your applications,\nyou wanna keep your settings, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.740\nYou potentially wanna keep your files\nWell you can do what's known as\n\n96\n00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.310\nan upgrade installation.\n\n97\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.080\nNow this is a little bit different in the\nfact that what you're going to do, it's\n\n98\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.110\nkind of like the Russian dolls, a doll\nwith inside a doll, with inside a doll.\n\n99\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.900\nWhat you're going to do, is you're going\nto take that existing operating system,\n\n100\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.660\nand you're going to take\na new operating system,\n\n101\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.860\nyou're going to lay it's architecture\nright over the old one, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.500\nNow has benefits and it has drawbacks\nas well it's no different right\n\n103\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.260\neverything in computing just like anything\nelse in life has its pros and cons right?\n\n104\n00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.320\nLet's go ahead and get the pessimistic\nside out of the way right?\n\n105\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.070\nYou don't get the benefit of\nthe fresh operating systems,\n\n106\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.110\nfresh settings, all clean right?\n\n107\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.000\nYou get remnants of what you've\ndone to the registry prior.\n\n108\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.080\nThat could be good, it could be bad.\n\n109\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.770\nBeneficial though is that depending\non your upgrade type, right?\n\n110\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.210\nWhat operating system you're going from,\nhow old the oldest operating system is\n\n111\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.810\nversus how new the new operating system\nis, you can retain your applications.\n\n112\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.990\nProvided there isn't compatibility\nissues to begin with,\n\n113\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.690\nyou can retain the settings in\nthe applications sometimes.\n\n114\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.010\nAs well as retaining your data.\n\n115\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.330\nNow that could be beneficial.\n\n116\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.070\nWhere could that be beneficial?\n\n117\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.600\nIf you work for a company that\nhas spent thousands of dollars,\n\n118\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.650\nand in fact, we were talking\nabout this in anther episode.\n\n119\n00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.800\nAnd Dan, you made a good point where you\nsaid hundreds of thousands of dollars on\n\n120\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.570\na line of business application,\n\n121\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.900\nyour company's probably gonna wanna\nget as much bang for their buck.\n\n122\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.750\nThey're gonna want that application\nto last as long as it can\n\n123\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.370\nbefore they're gonna shell out\ncash like that to upgrade.\n\n124\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.120\nThis is where you do get a benefit.\n\n125\n00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.000\nThen if you do what's known as an upgrade,\ninstall the new operating system on\n\n126\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.250\nthe old, you have the potential to\nsave the applications, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.470\nSo let's go ahead, and one of the things\nthat I wanna do is I wanna show you what\n\n128\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.230\nwould be the difference between\nthe different types of installations?\n\n129\n00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.830\nAlright well when it comes to\nthe different types of installations it\n\n130\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.020\ndepends on which one it\nis that you're doing.\n\n131\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.540\nSo for instance there are what's known\nas the clean install, all right.\n\n132\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.100\nAnd when we do the clean install you have\nto keep in mind that what you're going to\n\n133\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.440\nneed to do is you're going to need to\nhave your installation media, alright?\n\n134\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.480\nNow your installation media\ncould be the local source,\n\n135\n00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.470\ninstallation media that we\ntalked about on the first part.\n\n136\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.360\nIt could be something like\nthe deployment that we did.\n\n137\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.310\nIn fact, the deployment that we did\nwas a clean installation, all right?\n\n138\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.140\nYou might here the term bare\nmetal installation, right?\n\n139\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.720\nBare metal installation,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n140\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.000\nIt means you gotta bare metal hard\ndrive and there's nothing on it.\n\n141\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080\nNo operating system, nothing, right.\n\n142\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.450\nSo essentially a big glorified\nexpensive paperweight.\n\n143\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.050\nAnd you're gonna install\nthe operating system presto.\n\n144\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.790\nLet's go and show you at least\nthe starts of a clean installation.\n\n145\n00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.390\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're just\ngonna let's say insert our optical media,\n\n146\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.390\nand the play button for us is the power.\n\n147\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.030\nAnd notice it says,\nWindows is loading its files.\n\n148\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.548\nThis is the isofile that we were talking\nabout in the first part here that's\n\n149\n00:07:58.548 --> 00:08:03.140\nactually loading the pre-installation\nenvironment into RAM It's a small\n\n150\n00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.940\nstreamlined operating system\nthat doesn't survive reboots.\n\n151\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.100\nAnd what does it do?\n\n152\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.130\nIt allows you to the other\nportions of the dresser\n\n153\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.010\nthat we talked about with an ISO file.\n\n154\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.670\nIt's essentially a container\nthat contains all the parts to\n\n155\n00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.570\nbuild an operating system,\ninstall it on the local drive.\n\n156\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.620\nJust like buying a dresser\nthat is prepackaged but\n\n157\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.880\nyou have to put it together.\n\n158\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.530\n&gt;&gt; So it's like an amour.\n\n159\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.500\nIt's got doors that open, and\nthen there's drawers [LAUGH].\n\n160\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly it.\n\n161\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.440\nAnd then what you do is you open\nthe drawers and pull the pieces and\n\n162\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.120\ncomponents you want.\n\n163\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.900\nSo here's where the basic\ninstallation comes in.\n\n164\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.490\nNotice that we can, this is the clean\ninstall, we can select our language here.\n\n165\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.310\nIn this case it's gonna be English for\nus, ladies and gentleman.\n\n166\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.855\nIf you're watching from other\ncountries which we have\n\n167\n00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:46.737\nviewers all around the world.\n\n168\n00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:51.160\nJust understand that it's be contingent\non the installation media that you have.\n\n169\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.580\nI mean if you happen to be Korean,\nyou're doing a Korean installation.\n\n170\n00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.760\nThen guess what you're doing\na European installation then you're\n\n171\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.220\ngonna have an [INAUDIBLE] version.\n\n172\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.420\nAnd it'll have the languages\nassociated with that.\n\n173\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.810\nTime, currency and format,\nwe're gonna go ahead and leave it.\n\n174\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.370\nKeep in mind we could change this\ndepending on where we're at,\n\n175\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.420\nthe same thing with the keyboard.\n\n176\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.420\nFor me I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm just gonna choose Next.\n\n177\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.680\nNow I want you to be careful on this\nnext screen because we talked about to\n\n178\n00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.555\nrepair our installation, in fact I believe\nin other episodes we've actually shown you\n\n179\n00:09:19.555 --> 00:09:21.455\nbooting in to the recovery environment for\n\n180\n00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:24.085\nthe purposes of running\nsomething known as boot rack.\n\n181\n00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:27.915\nWell, this is actually how you get into\nthe recovery environment to do our repair\n\n182\n00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:29.075\ninstallations right here.\n\n183\n00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:30.940\nAnd if there was problems\nwith the hard drive,\n\n184\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.790\nproblems with the operating system we\ncould do all various types of things.\n\n185\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.980\nSystem restore, we could perform again we\ncan run the command prompt if you will.\n\n186\n00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.840\nWe can do a start up repair to even\ngo into the advanced boot options.\n\n187\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.930\nNow, if you were preparing for\nthis A+ exam,\n\n188\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.270\nwe want you to know the requirements for\ninstalling Windows.\n\n189\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.160\nAnd the great thing is,\n\n190\n00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.370\nthey've largely stayed the same\nsince the days of Windows 7.\n\n191\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.280\nNow, there's was a little bit more beefy,\nwell,\n\n192\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.630\nactually it really hasn't changed much.\n\n193\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.020\nIt's one gigahertz processor,\n\n194\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.010\nwhich is kind of joking today with\ntoday's power of the processors.\n\n195\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.330\nOne gig of RAM if it's\na 32-bit operating system.\n\n196\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.800\nTwo gigs of RAM if it's\na 64-bit operating system.\n\n197\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.730\nVista required a little bit more in\nthe fact that you had to have a 40 gig\n\n198\n00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.750\nhard drive.\n\n199\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.845\nThey pretty much kept that the same,\neven though I've seen that Windows\n\n200\n00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:26.670\n7 Windows 8 and 8.1 really only\ntake about 16 Gigs to install,\n\n201\n00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.260\nbut just know 40 Gig requirement for\nyour hard drive as well.\n\n202\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.442\nSo a couple things that you\nhave to realize, like I said,\n\n203\n00:10:33.442 --> 00:10:36.546\nyou say one gig of RAM and one gigahertz\nprocessor most people would laugh at you.\n\n204\n00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:37.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n205\n00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:39.453\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Grab the old monster on the shelf,\n\n206\n00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:43.179\nthat's been sitting around, be like get,\nI'm meant to do something with that,\n\n207\n00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.310\nit's not gonna be\ninstalling Windows [LAUGH].\n\n208\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the other thing too\nis those are minimum requirements.\n\n209\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.200\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that those\nare gonna be requirements that are gonna\n\n210\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.370\ngive you a-\n&gt;&gt; High performance.\n\n211\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Great performance.\n\n212\n00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.630\nWe call those the painful requirements.\n\n213\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.997\nCuz it's gonna be painful to\nrun the operating system, but-\n\n214\n00:10:59.997 --> 00:11:00.741\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever done it?\n\n215\n00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:02.373\n[CROSSTALK] the minimum requirements?\n\n216\n00:11:02.373 --> 00:11:05.967\n&gt;&gt; Yes I have,\nI have run Vista on its bare minimum and\n\n217\n00:11:05.967 --> 00:11:11.315\nwhen I say bare minimum it was 512\nMegs of RAM, and it was painful.\n\n218\n00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:13.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So keep that in mind.\n\n219\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.970\nSo what happens if you don't know?\n\n220\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.250\nYou don't know what you need to\ninstall the operating system.\n\n221\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.870\nWell I'm gonna give you guys a hint here.\n\n222\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.620\nWe have our practice labs out\nthere that give you access to do\n\n223\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.810\ninstalls of different operating\nsystems and see this hyperlink here?\n\n224\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.130\nI want you to click it.\n\n225\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.650\nI want you to click it.\n\n226\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.080\nAnd I'll explain what custom comes and\nupgrade here in a second.\n\n227\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.340\nBut I want you to scroll through this.\n\n228\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:36.899\nNotice what they tell you.\n\n229\n00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:39.670\nDecide whether you're gonna\nget a 32 bit or a 64 bit,\n\n230\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.800\ndepends on how much RAM\nyou need access to.\n\n231\n00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.416\nToday's day and age there's really\nno reason to go with 32 bit unless\n\n232\n00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:49.467\nyou happen to have some kind of notebook\nor tablet that might be limiting to you.\n\n233\n00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:52.923\nBut notice you have all of this\ngreat information that they give you\n\n234\n00:11:52.923 --> 00:11:58.010\nwhen it comes to exactly what it says,\nwhat to know before installing Windows.\n\n235\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.680\nI would use that and I have used that, I\nhave told students that I've trained over\n\n236\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.630\nthe past seven years or so\nin A+ to use this as part of your studies.\n\n237\n00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.598\nSo moving on, and again I apologize for\nthe matted lines here ladies and\n\n238\n00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:12.334\ngentlemen.\n\n239\n00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:16.851\nRemember this is Win PE this isn't the\noperating system we certainly aren't using\n\n240\n00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:20.310\nthe video drivers that are native\nto this graphics card.\n\n241\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.080\nNow next thing that we have\nis what's know as the EULA.\n\n242\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.880\n&gt;&gt; Lawyer talk.\n\n243\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.392\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:27.823\n&gt;&gt; Lawyer talk, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n245\n00:12:27.823 --> 00:12:32.612\naccept the terms and that at the end of\nthis episode we're gonna ask Dan what line\n\n246\n00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:37.196\n5501, sub clause A is.\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft reserves the right to\n\n247\n00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:38.795\nrepeal one soul.\n\n248\n00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:40.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty good, Dan.\n\n249\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.632\nIn fact, what have we got for him Johnny?\n\n250\n00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nwe'll go ahead and push next.\n\n251\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.830\nKeep in mind that you should be reading\nthis information if you wanna keep\n\n252\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.710\nyourself out of any kind of legality,\nor you pay a lawyer.\n\n253\n00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.440\nJust like Dan said, it's lawyer speak.\n\n254\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.130\nIf you pay a lawyer to do it but\nkeep in mind that is your end user\n\n255\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.590\nlicense agreement and you will be bound\nby the words within that contract.\n\n256\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.340\nSo it is important.\n\n257\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.970\nNow here's the option that you get, and\nI want you to be very careful with this on\n\n258\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.600\nthe exam because we're\nsaying clean installation.\n\n259\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.320\nDan can you show me where it says\nClean installation in these choices?\n\n260\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no problem.\n\n261\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.700\nLet me write it down right here.\n\n262\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it doesn't say clean anywhere.\n\n263\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.710\n&gt;&gt; And that's always confused me.\n\n264\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A custom installation is\n\n265\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.190\ninstalling a new copy of Windows.\n\n266\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:20.800\nBe careful.\n\n267\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Exam alert,\n\n268\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.830\nbecause they might show you\nan exhibit that says, okay,\n\n269\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.220\nyou need to do a clean installation.\n\n270\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.230\nWhich one of these, and you won't\nknow it if you've never installed it.\n\n271\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:33.000\nSo get in labs, use our practice labs\nthat you guys have access to out there.\n\n272\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.260\nGet your free trial of Windows that\nyou can download the ISO files and\n\n273\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.280\nyou can practice with this.\n\n274\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.190\nBut we're gonna go ahead and do custom,\nwe'll show you upgrade in a second.\n\n275\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.280\nIf I was to run upgrade,\nit would tell me that I cannot run this.\n\n276\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.790\nAnd I'll tell you why here in a second.\n\n277\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.410\nWe're gonna go ahead and go to custom.\n\n278\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.550\nNow here's a couple of thing.\n\n279\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.580\nThis isn't so much for\nthe exam that I want you to be aware of.\n\n280\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.040\nWell, I guess portions of it.\n\n281\n00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.060\nIf you need to load third party drivers,\nthis is where you could do it.\n\n282\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.570\nLet me tell you where this\nsometimes comes in handy.\n\n283\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:07.010\nSometimes Windows doesn't have even\nthough Microsoft is really good\n\n284\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:12.370\nabout bundling in tons of drivers for\nall different types of hardware,\n\n285\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.830\nto at least allow you to\ninstall the operating system.\n\n286\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.000\nSo then, you can download from\nthe manufacturer's website\n\n287\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.780\nadditional drivers here.\n\n288\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.460\nHowever, sometimes\nchipsets on motherboards.\n\n289\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.453\nIf you're using a RAID array and\nit has a RAID array controller,\n\n290\n00:14:26.453 --> 00:14:28.590\na hardware controller in it.\n\n291\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.600\nSometimes the drivers aren't recognized.\n\n292\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.850\nAnd what happens here\nis this will be blank.\n\n293\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.910\nAnd what that means is,\nthe Windows pre-installation environment\n\n294\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.470\nthat memory resident operating system\nthat's gonna allow you to install the full\n\n295\n00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.760\nblown Windows, doesn't have the driver\nto your chipset for the motherboard,\n\n296\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.860\ndoesn't have the for the for the RAID\narray and it doesn't show anything here.\n\n297\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.700\nI've run into that, my gigabyte board,\n\n298\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.110\none of the gigabyte boards that I\nhave right now, it doesn't show.\n\n299\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.710\nSo what I would have to do is\nI'd have to go to load driver.\n\n300\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.240\nAnd when I click load driver,\nit will tell me to install the driver.\n\n301\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.210\nI can browse to it.\n\n302\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.600\nAnd then again,\nyou can have a USB thumb drive here.\n\n303\n00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.430\nAnd you can plug it into the USB\nport on the computer and\n\n304\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.080\nyou could essentially browse to it.\n\n305\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.990\nNow what you see here, boot.boot,\nthe x drive if you will.\n\n306\n00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.560\nThat's actually the optical\ninstallation drive if you will.\n\n307\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.980\nIt's kind of like a virtual drive.\n\n308\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.100\nSo I don't have it.\n\n309\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.580\nOr you can scan it.\n\n310\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.490\nAnd Windows look, if we try to scan, it's\ngonna say no signed drivers were found.\n\n311\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:32.060\nI'm not really worried about that because\nI can see that the storage location,\n\n312\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.900\nif you will, has showed up.\n\n313\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.940\nNow if you wanted to, you could\nalso do partitioning here as well.\n\n314\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.080\nAnd when we do partitioning, this would\ngive us the ability to create and\n\n315\n00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.010\ndivide this space the way we want.\n\n316\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.860\nI'm going to go ahead and\nI'm just going to say Next to this.\n\n317\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.623\nWhen you do it starts to\nexpand the Windows files.\n\n318\n00:15:50.623 --> 00:15:53.599\nAgain, keep in mind that,\nwhat we're talking about is,\n\n319\n00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:57.573\nwe're talking about the Win P or\npreinstallation environment is actually.\n\n320\n00:15:57.573 --> 00:15:59.503\nLoading the operating system, right?\n\n321\n00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:03.980\nDan talked about IO and I didn't even\nknow what it was that you called it.\n\n322\n00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.310\nI call it a drawer, a bureau.\n\n323\n00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.209\nWhat did you call it?\n&gt;&gt; An armoire.\n\n324\n00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:06.946\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes, exactly.\n\n325\n00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:07.513\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:16:07.513 --> 00:16:09.130\n&gt;&gt; That's the French thing, right?\n\n327\n00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.194\nYou open it up, right?\n\n328\n00:16:10.194 --> 00:16:13.241\nAnd you're basically,\nyou have all the different drawers and\n\n329\n00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.900\nyou're unpacking whatever\nit is that you want to use.\n\n330\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.900\nWell, that's kinda what's going on here.\n\n331\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.630\nNow, we've already got this turkey cooked,\nright?\n\n332\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.100\nBecause we've already, you've seen a\ndeployment where we did image deployment.\n\n333\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.110\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and let me just\nbump on over here and show you the post\n\n334\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:36.840\ninstallation options that you might need\nto be doing to finish the installation.\n\n335\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.739\nAll right,\nnotice we have Windows 7 Ultimate, right?\n\n336\n00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:43.375\nThis is just gonna finish,\nit'll probably put us into, Actually,\n\n337\n00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:46.090\nthis is the post-installation here,\ngonna make sure of that, right?\n\n338\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.020\nSo, we're gonna type the username.\n\n339\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.980\nKeep in mind I'll just put,\nbecause I am very creative,\n\n340\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.150\nwe just put Student01 and\nI'll choose Next.\n\n341\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.450\nAnd what this is doing,\nis setting up the very first user.\n\n342\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.970\nYou have to be careful cuz the very first\nuser becomes the Windows administrator,\n\n343\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.640\nnot the default administrator,\nthat account's been disabled since Vista.\n\n344\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.900\nHowever, keep in mind that this is also\ngonna be your administrative user that\n\n345\n00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.960\nit is allowed to click Yes on any\ntime a user account control comes up.\n\n346\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.744\nSo this is kind of a privileged account,\nif you will.\n\n347\n00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.870\nAnd we're gonna go ahead,\ntype our password.\n\n348\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:26.230\nAnd I think they matched and\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n349\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.150\nAll right, now here's another\noption that you have, okay?\n\n350\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.100\nTyping in your Windows product key.\n\n351\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.770\nAll right, I want you to be\ncareful with this one because,\n\n352\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.690\nyou notice I'm gonna push Skip.\n\n353\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.542\nWhy might I push Skip?\n\n354\n00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:41.407\nAll right,\nwell here's how a product key works.\n\n355\n00:17:41.407 --> 00:17:46.160\nWhen you do an installation, your product\nkey gets tied to a hardware configuration.\n\n356\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.303\nAll right, part of this product key,\nwhen during the installation process,\n\n357\n00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:53.190\nthe installation will take a blueprint,\nif you will,\n\n358\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.802\nof all the hardware that's\nwithin the machine.\n\n359\n00:17:55.802 --> 00:17:58.470\nAnd it'll create a hardware ID,\n\n360\n00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.950\nthat is then with this product ID or\nkey, is going to be matched.\n\n361\n00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.832\nThe product ID is what Microsoft\nmaintains, they have a database,\n\n362\n00:18:06.832 --> 00:18:07.522\nall right?\n\n363\n00:18:07.522 --> 00:18:11.061\nAnd that product ID is generated based on\nthe product key that you put here, but\n\n364\n00:18:11.061 --> 00:18:12.470\nthey match.\n\n365\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.938\nAnd then that is sent over to the Windows\nactivation servers, and when the Windows\n\n366\n00:18:15.938 --> 00:18:20.248\nactivation servers, well Microsoft if\nyou will, Looks at it in their database,\n\n367\n00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:24.457\nthey say okay,\nhas this installation ever been activated?\n\n368\n00:18:24.457 --> 00:18:26.641\nCuz you only get to activate it once.\n\n369\n00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.160\nSo what are they looking for?\n\n370\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.165\nThey're looking for\n\n371\n00:18:29.165 --> 00:18:33.210\nthe product identifier which they already\nhave that in their database, all right?\n\n372\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.500\nThey're also looking in their database\nto see if it's ever been activated,\n\n373\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.710\nbecause if it's been activated,\n\n374\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.380\nit has a hardware identifier that's\nalso associated with it already.\n\n375\n00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.580\nBut in this case,\nsince it's the first installation,\n\n376\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.790\nit doesn't have a hardware identifier.\n\n377\n00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.800\nSo that package that I said,\nthe product ID, the hardware ID,\n\n378\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.410\nthey get married together and\nthey get sent over the activation server.\n\n379\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.270\nNow, it has a hardware identifier\nassociated with it and\n\n380\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.580\nit's gonna store in the database.\n\n381\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.690\nWhen that happens, they generate a third\nidentifier, that is then sent back to your\n\n382\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.341\nmachine and stored in the registry\ncalled an activation ID.\n\n383\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.570\nAnd it's one of the things that\nthe boot manager looks for\n\n384\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.250\nevery time the operating system boots up.\n\n385\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.340\nSays yeah, it's activated,\nyou get full functionality.\n\n386\n00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.470\nNow here's the thing, if you install this\noperating system and activate it now,\n\n387\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.360\nand have an activation ID, what happens\nif you're in the testing phase?\n\n388\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.518\nAnd you're just testing the operating\nsystem, and you wanna see, is Windows\n\n389\n00:19:26.518 --> 00:19:30.430\ngonna run adequately on the current\nhardware configuration that I have?\n\n390\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.858\nYou say, okay,\nwell I'm gonna go ahead and activate it.\n\n391\n00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:36.000\nAnd then when you find out that there\nare some pieces of the machine,\n\n392\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.010\nthe system unit that you wanna upgrade,\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n393\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.590\nI don't know where it starts and\nwhere it ends, but\n\n394\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.140\nthere is a point when you start\nupgrading pieces that, guess what?\n\n395\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.885\nWhen the operating system with\na boot manager loads up and\n\n396\n00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:51.318\nit looks at the hardware profile,\nthe hardware identifier associated\n\n397\n00:19:51.318 --> 00:19:54.966\nwith the activation ID, And that hardware\nidentifier is going to be generated as\n\n398\n00:19:54.966 --> 00:19:59.240\nsomething new cuz you've changed too many\npieces, this is a different machine.\n\n399\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.990\nThe activation ID gets erased from\nthe registry and you have to reactivate.\n\n400\n00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.780\nAnd here's the problem.\n\n401\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.010\nIf I go back and\nI try to reactivate again and\n\n402\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.090\nit's got a different hardware identifier,\nwhen that two, That product ID and\n\n403\n00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.930\nnow let's say, hardware identifier,\ntwo get married together and\n\n404\n00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:18.455\nsent to the activation server, Microsoft\nsays well let's look at the product ID.\n\n405\n00:20:18.455 --> 00:20:19.625\nOkay, I see the product ID.\n\n406\n00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:22.505\nAgain, keep in mind,\nthey keep that in their database.\n\n407\n00:20:22.505 --> 00:20:26.595\nBut I also see hardware identifier,\none has already been associated with\n\n408\n00:20:26.595 --> 00:20:29.185\nthis product identifiers,\nso no activation fails.\n\n409\n00:20:30.385 --> 00:20:31.630\nAnd guess what you have to do?\n\n410\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.183\nYou have to pay for\na new copy of Windows, all right?\n\n411\n00:20:34.183 --> 00:20:36.960\nNow, it's not a bad thing to say, Skip.\n\n412\n00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.308\nSo some of you guys out there are probably\ngonna try to send me hate mail saying,\n\n413\n00:20:40.308 --> 00:20:41.855\nhey you're skipping activation.\n\n414\n00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:44.801\nI'm doing it on purpose.\nI'm doing it because I wanna test\n\n415\n00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:46.670\nthe operating system.\n\n416\n00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.265\nIt is nothing illegal about\nMicrosoft giving me a 30-day trial.\n\n417\n00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:53.360\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey give you the option to skip it.\n\n418\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.525\nIf it was illegal to do,\nthey would not give you the option.\n\n419\n00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:56.160\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n420\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.880\nAnd we call it the burn-in period, right?\n\n421\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.640\nThat’s the burn-in period,\nyou wanna find out.\n\n422\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.380\n&gt;&gt; A test drive, yeah.\n\n423\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.930\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right,\nwe wanna test drive this thing.\n\n424\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.620\nAnd guess what, if it doesn't\nperform adequately, we upgrade and\n\n425\n00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.260\nthen we reinstall the operating system.\n\n426\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.120\nNo big deal,\nwe reinstall the operating system.\n\n427\n00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.890\nWe test it again and\nif it runs correctly, if it\n\n428\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:19.210\nruns within the means that you that gives\nyou the performance, then you activate it.\n\n429\n00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.550\nNow I say that and that's for\na long rant on that, but let me tell you,\n\n430\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.960\nthat can save you a lot of money.\n\n431\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.209\nAnd if nothing else, it can save you a lot\nof time on the phone talking to a person\n\n432\n00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:32.306\nthat's gonna say, Okay, well let's go back\nand let's figure out what's going on.\n\n433\n00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:34.740\nAll right,\nhere's your end-user license agreement.\n\n434\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.520\nKeep in mind, the terms are the same but\nthey're a little bit different then\n\n435\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.560\nbecause we did a deployment over\nthe network versus a local installation.\n\n436\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.999\nSo we're gonna go ahead and choose Next.\n\n437\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.440\nNext thing we have is how to protect\nyour operating system, right?\n\n438\n00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.390\nOr one of the ways that we protect\nour operating system is to use\n\n439\n00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.320\nrecommended settings.\n\n440\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.630\nAnd this is the, basically,\n\n441\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.440\nthe dynamic security that will be built\nin the Windows including updates.\n\n442\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.460\nNotice it says, making\nthe Windows Internet browsing safer.\n\n443\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.392\nThis turns on things like\nthe SmartScreen Filter,\n\n444\n00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:10.097\nturns on your security zones which we'll\nlook at in control panel configurations\n\n445\n00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:11.883\ncoming up on another episode.\n\n446\n00:22:11.883 --> 00:22:15.510\nAnd then check online for\nsolutions to problems, all right?\n\n447\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.111\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and I'll just\nsay, use recommended settings, all right?\n\n448\n00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:24.415\nNow by default, when you review your date\nand time settings, please understand that\n\n449\n00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:28.380\nyour date, time, we've looked at\nlanguage already and regional settings.\n\n450\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.539\nKeep this in mind that it always\ndefaults to Bill Gates land, [LAUGH] or\n\n451\n00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:34.920\nCalifornian time, Pacific time.\n\n452\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.270\nI'm gonna go ahead and for the purposes\nof just our demonstration here,\n\n453\n00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.370\nI'm gonna change it cuz we're\non the Eastern Time Zone.\n\n454\n00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.817\nWhatever you're doing out there,\nif you're following along in the labs,\n\n455\n00:22:42.817 --> 00:22:44.050\nchange it to your local time, right?\n\n456\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.968\nIt certainly isn't gonna hurt anything,\nall right?\n\n457\n00:22:46.968 --> 00:22:48.395\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n458\n00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:50.668\nAnd we'll let it finish its installation,\nright?\n\n459\n00:22:50.668 --> 00:22:55.388\nNow what it did in\nthe background is- Essentially,\n\n460\n00:22:55.388 --> 00:22:58.989\nwhat it did was created the user profile,\nall right?\n\n461\n00:22:58.989 --> 00:23:02.682\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and log on and,\nremember I told you the answer file?\n\n462\n00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:05.623\nNotice that this computer is\nalready joined to the domain?\n\n463\n00:23:05.623 --> 00:23:07.215\nHopefully.\n\n464\n00:23:07.215 --> 00:23:12.140\nHopefully, wanna keep our fingers crossed,\nit is already joined to the domain.\n\n465\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.147\nI'll show you ladies and\ngentlemen out there,\n\n466\n00:23:14.147 --> 00:23:16.470\nwhat I mean when I say\nworkgroup vs domain.\n\n467\n00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:17.785\nWe gotta kinda talk about that.\n\n468\n00:23:17.785 --> 00:23:20.575\nBut now, it says preparing the desktop.\n\n469\n00:23:20.575 --> 00:23:22.345\nWhat is going on here in the background?\n\n470\n00:23:22.345 --> 00:23:25.145\nWell you have what's known inside\na Windows as a default profile.\n\n471\n00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:27.754\nAnd when the default profile\nis all of the locations\n\n472\n00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:30.795\nthat you find in the user profile,\nbut they're all blank.\n\n473\n00:23:30.795 --> 00:23:34.301\nAnd what that means is its gonna\ntake the name that you've applied,\n\n474\n00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.342\nin this case Student01, all right?\n\n475\n00:23:36.342 --> 00:23:40.047\nAnd it's gonna essentially pull down\nthe default profile, copy it, and\n\n476\n00:23:40.047 --> 00:23:41.372\nthen apply Student01.\n\n477\n00:23:41.372 --> 00:23:47.590\nAnd now that's Student01, in this case,\nis local directory in locations.\n\n478\n00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:52.500\nNow, you might have to install things\nlike third party drivers, right?\n\n479\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.860\nWhere might we do that?\n\n480\n00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.501\nAll right.\n\n481\n00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:57.650\nLet's go ahead and\nwere gonna push our Start button, and\n\n482\n00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.432\nwere gonna go to Control Panel.\n\n483\n00:23:59.432 --> 00:24:01.613\nWe're gonna go to System and Security.\n\n484\n00:24:01.613 --> 00:24:04.860\nAdministrative tools and we've talked\nheavily about this in another episode.\n\n485\n00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.880\nSo, we're kinda going through this fast.\n\n486\n00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.713\nIf you don't know where\nthese locations are,\n\n487\n00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:11.400\ngo check out some of the tools\nthat we've talked about.\n\n488\n00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.670\nWe're gonna go to Computer Management.\n\n489\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.869\nHere in Computer Management I'm looking\nfor something known as Device Manager.\n\n490\n00:24:17.869 --> 00:24:19.604\nWhen I open up Device Manager,\n\n491\n00:24:19.604 --> 00:24:23.600\nI will see that I have some things\nthat aren't recognize right away.\n\n492\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.380\nYou can always tell that\nwhen you have other devices.\n\n493\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.650\nWhen I have other devices,\n\n494\n00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.470\nwhat that means is that it doesn't\nknow what does other devices are.\n\n495\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.730\nNotice how it categorize everything here?\n\n496\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.340\nIt means there's something in this\nhardware that it doesn't recognize.\n\n497\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.210\nAnd I can usually find that\nout by a little question mark.\n\n498\n00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.010\nAnd I can right-click on this device,\nand I can choose properties.\n\n499\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.140\nNotice what it says, drivers for\nthis device are not installed.\n\n500\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.560\nAll right, that happens because Windows\ndoesn't have it pre-built-in so\n\n501\n00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.730\nyou have to install those drivers.\n\n502\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.320\nAll right, now I'm gonna kinda cheat\nthe system a little bit here and one of\n\n503\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.250\nthe things that you might notice is that\nits going to install third party drivers.\n\n504\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.320\nSo we're gonna go ahead, in this case\nwe're going to install some tools.\n\n505\n00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.350\nAnd we're going to install VMwares,\n\n506\n00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:15.380\nthird party drivers, to get this\nmachine operational, all right.\n\n507\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.270\nSo I went ahead and kinda simulated\nkind of throw in the driver\n\n508\n00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.280\ndisc if you will into the optical tray.\n\n509\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.004\nWe're gonna go to Computer, and\nwe're gonna run the software.\n\n510\n00:25:25.004 --> 00:25:28.090\nAnd it is gonna prepare for installation.\n\n511\n00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.240\nNow while this is installing,\n\n512\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.102\nI wanna talk about two other things here\nthat we really haven't talked about yet.\n\n513\n00:25:33.102 --> 00:25:37.520\nAll right, and one of those is something\nknown as a factory recovery partition or\n\n514\n00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.320\njust in general a recovery partition.\n\n515\n00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.240\nBecause I mentioned something known\nas a repair installation, well you\n\n516\n00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.340\nalso have the ability for a manufacturer\nto create a protected partition.\n\n517\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.260\nThat in your one time boot menu,\nwhen you do your boot method,\n\n518\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.100\nyou actually point it to\nthe recovery partition.\n\n519\n00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.680\nAnd it has an image on your\nsystem that you can pull down and\n\n520\n00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.310\nreimage this hard drive from bare metal,\njust like we did when Dan and\n\n521\n00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.622\nI showed you the image deployment.\n\n522\n00:26:02.622 --> 00:26:04.510\n&gt;&gt; It is a sweet, sweet thing, my man.\n\n523\n00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.957\nIt happens right?\n\n524\n00:26:06.957 --> 00:26:09.779\nYou get to kicking around inside\nyour operating system, and\n\n525\n00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:11.338\nyou kinda hose it up pretty hard.\n\n526\n00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:12.620\nAnd what do you do?\n\n527\n00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.444\nWell, you've got this lovely recovery\nimage, and you just go right back to\n\n528\n00:26:16.444 --> 00:26:19.817\na good clean place that you know\nthat the operating system worked.\n\n529\n00:26:19.817 --> 00:26:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, yeah, and\nit saves you a ton of nightmares.\n\n530\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.640\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n531\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.440\nagain, every one of these is gonna be\nspecific to the installation that you do.\n\n532\n00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.844\nLet's go ahead and just kinda do it basic,\nand show you how all of a sudden,\n\n533\n00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:34.478\nthe video drivers are recognized.\n\n534\n00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:36.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n535\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.240\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do our basic\ninstall, and it's gonna come through.\n\n536\n00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.910\nHopefully, it won't take too long here.\n\n537\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.600\nBut again, keep in mind that\nwith third party, they're\n\n538\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.120\nnot going to expect you to know all the\ndifferent third parties, but they're gonna\n\n539\n00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.610\nwant you to know the basic process that\nwe showed you here with device manager.\n\n540\n00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.580\nThat's the first place I go\nif I'm doing installations.\n\n541\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.840\nI don't even care if it's a,\nif it's a remote deployment.\n\n542\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.410\nI will try to connect to the machine and\nverify that on the server side, and\n\n543\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.430\nthis is how I tell, that I've configured\nthe server side appropriately,\n\n544\n00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.850\nbecause you put driver packages\nup there that wanna know,\n\n545\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.000\ndid one of the machines pull\ndown it's driver package?\n\n546\n00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.360\nBecause if they're identical chances\nare they're gonna pull down from every\n\n547\n00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.610\nother machine.\n\n548\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.240\nBut if this never any guarantees, right?\n\n549\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.681\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes, I typically use\nthe device manager like a checklist.\n\n550\n00:27:23.681 --> 00:27:27.070\nOkay, I've got a bunch of nice\nlittle exclamation points here.\n\n551\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.006\nLet's take them one at a time,\nbecause in virtual machines,\n\n552\n00:27:30.006 --> 00:27:33.008\nit's usually very nice like what\nWes is showing you right now.\n\n553\n00:27:33.008 --> 00:27:36.057\nYou install the virtual machine\ntool set of whatever that is, and\n\n554\n00:27:36.057 --> 00:27:38.980\nall your drivers are there and\neverything works great.\n\n555\n00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.969\nIf you're working with hardware from\na manufacturer, someone like Dell,\n\n556\n00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:44.976\nthey'll send you a driver CD or a DVD.\n\n557\n00:27:44.976 --> 00:27:48.850\nAnd if you lose that you can\nget it from their website, but\n\n558\n00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.560\nit can be very daunting.\n\n559\n00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.529\nWhat do I have you to put\nin your service tag, and\n\n560\n00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:58.430\non their website at the support.dell.com,\nfind out what machine you have,\n\n561\n00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:03.600\nfind out what drivers you have for\nthe actual hardware inside of the machine.\n\n562\n00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.570\nDownload those things,\nput it on a USB, plug it in and\n\n563\n00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.600\nthen start walking through\na bunch of installations.\n\n564\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.940\nIt can be a bit time consuming, so\ntrying to find any way you can speed up or\n\n565\n00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.580\nkeep a repository or drivers and\nyou really can be very helpful.\n\n566\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's one of the features that I love,\n\n567\n00:28:18.742 --> 00:28:20.906\nat least on the Windows\ndeployment services side,\n\n568\n00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:24.200\nthat you can put all those driver packages\nup like you said, in a repository.\n\n569\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.848\nAnd what happens is that machines\nare smart enough to communicate, and\n\n570\n00:28:28.848 --> 00:28:32.808\nthe server will say,\nI see you're an OptiPlex 980.\n\n571\n00:28:32.808 --> 00:28:34.364\nWell, you need these\ndrivers here take them.\n\n572\n00:28:34.364 --> 00:28:35.730\nThey're already there.\n\n573\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.123\nWe don't have to do all of that.\n\n574\n00:28:37.123 --> 00:28:41.082\nSo you could see that we don't have\nany matted lines here anymore.\n\n575\n00:28:41.082 --> 00:28:44.005\nI'm gonna shoot from the hip on this one\nand see if we go back to device manager.\n\n576\n00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:48.426\nWow, so all of a sudden, other devices.\n\n577\n00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Our work.\n\n578\n00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.662\n&gt;&gt; Become system devices.\n\n579\n00:28:51.662 --> 00:28:52.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n580\n00:28:52.162 --> 00:28:52.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n581\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.190\n&gt;&gt; So notice Dan right here hopefully,\n\n582\n00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.760\nnotice that I don't have the other\ndevices category anymore.\n\n583\n00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.210\nAnd that's because they're all\n\n584\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.485\nrecognized even though you can't recognize\nthem out there cuz I'm all over the place.\n\n585\n00:29:04.485 --> 00:29:06.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice that they're gone, right?\n\n586\n00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:10.091\n&gt;&gt; And the last thing to do on\nthis would be a restart okay, and\n\n587\n00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:14.459\nI'm not gonna really bore you guys there\nwith a restart here but Dan it does look\n\n588\n00:29:14.459 --> 00:29:18.789\nlike I've kinda taken up your time cuz\nI still wanna show you like an upgrade.\n\n589\n00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:20.518\nAnd some of the things\nthat they talk about or\n\n590\n00:29:20.518 --> 00:29:23.287\nsome of the file systems that you have\nto be aware of and the disk types.\n\n591\n00:29:23.287 --> 00:29:25.947\nBecause you gotta know if you're\ngonna partition a machine,\n\n592\n00:29:25.947 --> 00:29:27.820\nwhat kind of partitions are you gonna use.\n\n593\n00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.770\n&gt;&gt; Well it sounds like fun Wes,\nlooking forward to it.\n\n594\n00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.750\nThis has been a really great episode\nwe do thank you for your time.\n\n595\n00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.430\nWe think you good folks out there for\nwatching so come on back for part three.\n\n596\n00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.644\nIt's gonna be a lot of good\ninformation in that episode.\n\n597\n00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:39.587\nIt's gonna be a lot of good.\n\n598\n00:29:39.587 --> 00:29:41.570\nAs for this episode it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n599\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.970\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI have been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n600\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n601\n00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.886\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n602\n00:29:46.886 --> 00:29:53.129\n[MUSIC]\n\n603\n00:29:53.129 --> 00:29:55.849\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:13.859\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.380\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.810\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode well I hope your settling in for\n\n6\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.390\nmore A plus cuz that's what\nwe're dishing up today, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.345\njoining us back in the studio,\nthe head chef himself, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:29.820\nWes, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.428\n&gt;&gt; It's going great I didn't know I\nwas guest starring on an episode of\n\n10\n00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:34.142\nAmerican Iron Chef there, that's great.\n\n11\n00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:34.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.864\nAll right, well then we're serving up\nmore of that installation of Windows for\n\n13\n00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:41.840\nsure today, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll kinda pick up,\n\n14\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.710\nright where we left off in part two.\n\n15\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.330\nOne of the last things that we\ndid was a clean installation.\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.350\nAnd I did mention some of the post\ninstallation configuration.\n\n17\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.950\nWe talked about installing things\nlike your third party drivers.\n\n18\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.140\nWe showed you creating\nthe first user account.\n\n19\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.751\nSetting things like your date and time.\n\n20\n00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:58.610\nYour regional settings as well.\n\n21\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.103\nBut one of the things that I really just\nmentioned, but I didn't show you anything,\n\n22\n00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:05.204\nis the whole work group versus domain.\n\n23\n00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:08.340\nSee, if you're in a small office,\nhome office environment.\n\n24\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.985\nOr if you're really just in a home\nenvironment in general, most likely\n\n25\n00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:15.535\nwhat your Windows machine is gonna be\na part of is what's known as workgroup.\n\n26\n00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:20.795\nNow Microsoft calls this workgroup but\nyou might hear it called other things by\n\n27\n00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:24.105\nvendor neutral classifications like,\nfor instance,\n\n28\n00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:28.476\na peer to peer network and what that\nmeans is it's completely decentralized.\n\n29\n00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:31.780\nWe call a peer, essentially,\nan operating system or\n\n30\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.240\na series of operating systems that\nare all equal in the fact that sometimes,\n\n31\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.410\nthey could be requesting a service or\neven offering a service.\n\n32\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.024\nLet me give you an example\nof what I mean here.\n\n33\n00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:43.630\nSo if I have a printer that's\nconnected to a machine, right.\n\n34\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.240\nWell that printer, I could share it out\nwith the rest of the operating systems\n\n35\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.230\nwithin that small\ndecentralized environment.\n\n36\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.207\nIn that aspect it's going\nto act like a print server.\n\n37\n00:01:52.207 --> 00:01:56.047\nSo other clients, out there, other peers,\nare going to request that hey,\n\n38\n00:01:56.047 --> 00:01:59.058\nI need to use your printer,\ncan I send that print job to you?\n\n39\n00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:03.900\nNow we've got an operating system that's\nany old Windows client operating system.\n\n40\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.210\nBut it's acting like a server and it could\nalso be acting like a client right, so\n\n41\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.860\nit's a decentralized model in\nthe fact that every user account\n\n42\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.810\nis essentially managed and\nmaintained by each individual computer.\n\n43\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.127\nSo if I wanted to have let's\nsay a Wes user account or\n\n44\n00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:26.159\nW Bryan if that happens to be our name,\nWes Bryan, here W Bryan user account.\n\n45\n00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.352\nI'd have to go to every machine,\nright, and\n\n46\n00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:30.257\nI would have to create a user account and\n\n47\n00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:34.730\nmake sure that the password is the same\nin order to log in to all the machines.\n\n48\n00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.030\nUnlike a domain environment, and\na domain environment is one in which, it's\n\n49\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.810\na centralized model when it comes to the\nmanagement of user accounts if you will.\n\n50\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.070\nAnd it's a client-server type network\nin which we have specific clients that\n\n51\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.420\nare requesting resources of other\ncomputers out there and those computers\n\n52\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.650\nthat are basically providing those\nresources are called servers, right?\n\n53\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.120\nDomain environment is something that\nyou see inside of your corporate\n\n54\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.950\nnetworks versus something that you work or\nsomething you see in the home environment\n\n55\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.830\nand even really against small office,\nhome office environments.\n\n56\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.140\nI do want to mention one more thing\nwhen it comes to work groups.\n\n57\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.780\nWork groups are limited in\nWindows to 10 computers.\n\n58\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.880\nAnything over 10 computers, you have\nto move to the client server model,\n\n59\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.690\nbecause again,\njust administration being decentralized,\n\n60\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.360\nit becomes an administrative nightmare,\nright?\n\n61\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.480\nThere's a reason we have terms like that,\nbecause it just becomes very,\n\n62\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.400\nvery problematic to manage all the\nresources individually on each computer.\n\n63\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.950\nNow let me show you one of the things\nthat can kind of tell you right away,\n\n64\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.840\ncould, not necessarily, but\n\n65\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.190\ncould show you right away that you are in\na domain versus a workgroup environment.\n\n66\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.680\nYou can actually see it\nright from the login screen.\n\n67\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.610\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n68\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.100\nSo this computer's actually a part\nof a work group, all right,\n\n69\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.760\nand when we look at it you might notice\nsomething here is that it's just a basic\n\n70\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.130\nlog on,\nthere's nothing crazy about it, right?\n\n71\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.270\nAnd when I go ahead and I log in,\nall right, normal log in,\n\n72\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.320\nnothing different but the log in screen\nwas different than this one right here.\n\n73\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.100\nNotice that this one right here has\na control alt delete to log in.\n\n74\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.530\nThat's something known as a secure\nauthentication sequence in\n\n75\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.410\nthe Windows world.\n\n76\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.060\nIt means that in order to\ninteract with this computer,\n\n77\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.630\nthe only way you can log in is\nto choose control alt delete.\n\n78\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.170\nNow since I've already logged\ninto this machine before,\n\n79\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.950\nnotice that the log in looked\na little bit different right?\n\n80\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.300\nIn the work group machine it\njust said the username, right?\n\n81\n00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.400\nHowever, this is a domain\njoined computer and\n\n82\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.370\nnotice that we have this name,\na backslash and then the username, right?\n\n83\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.270\nWell that is essentially the domain\nthat this computer is part of and\n\n84\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.930\nthis is the user account\nwithin the domain.\n\n85\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.500\nAll right and we'll go ahead and\nwe'll get logged into this machine.\n\n86\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.772\nNow I do want you to know that there's\na location that you can go to find out\n\n87\n00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:52.993\nif your computer is joined to a domain or\na work group and\n\n88\n00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.528\nthat's through your system properties.\n\n89\n00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:58.360\nYour system control panel if you will.\n\n90\n00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.611\nIf we go to well the start button, we go\nto control panel, system and security.\n\n91\n00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:07.330\nSystem, we can see it.\n\n92\n00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.849\nNow we can also go, remember there's\nanother way to get to this too.\n\n93\n00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.590\nWe can do start.\n\n94\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.880\nWe can right click computer.\n\n95\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.070\nAnd we can choose properties.\n\n96\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.050\nI'll go ahead and launch it up from there.\n\n97\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.940\nNow notice that in\nthe system control panel.\n\n98\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.030\nWe have this, computer name,\ndomain, and workgroup settings.\n\n99\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.550\nNotice that it tells me\nthe full computer name here.\n\n100\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.114\nAll right, and let me kinda zoom out and\n\n101\n00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:34.474\nget here notice that I'm part of a domain,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:34.474 --> 00:05:37.234\nAnd as you'll go on,\nwhen you go into your networking,\n\n103\n00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:40.760\nwe talk about things like fully\nqualified domain names, right?\n\n104\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.798\nWe talk about networking in general.\n\n105\n00:05:42.798 --> 00:05:46.070\nWe mentioned this type of\nnaming convention, right?\n\n106\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.770\nYou have a host name or a computer name in\nthis case and then the domain name, but\n\n107\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.110\nthis lets me know that\nit's joined to the domain.\n\n108\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.520\nAll right, now that being said if we\nswitch back over to this machine we'll do\n\n109\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.120\nthe same thing.\n\n110\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.610\nWe'll go to Start,\nthis time I'll go the long way around.\n\n111\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.550\nStart, control panel, system and\n\n112\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.800\nsecurity, just a couple different ways to\nget to the same location, then system.\n\n113\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.310\nSame thing comes up.\n\n114\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.570\nBut notice, this time, that it\ndoesn't say domain right here, right?\n\n115\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.420\nIt says work group.\n\n116\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.344\nAnd by default,\nthis is the work group name that it uses.\n\n117\n00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:19.460\nIt's essentially nothing\nmore than a BIOS name.\n\n118\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.440\nNow, what happens if I wanted to\njoin a computer to the domain?\n\n119\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.380\nWell, from there what I would do is\nI would go up here to the demand\n\n120\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.109\nsystem settings.\n\n121\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.450\nAll right, and I go to Computer Name,\nthe Computer Name tab and\n\n122\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.360\nnotice to that says, to rename this\ncomputer or change its domain or\n\n123\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.630\nworkgroup, you click Change, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.800\nAnd then from here what I could do is I\ncould change the workgroup name if I want\n\n125\n00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.660\nto join the workgroup or\nI could join it to the domain all right.\n\n126\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.420\nAnd then here is where I would type in,\noops!\n\n127\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.310\nNot that right there.\n\n128\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.996\nI would type in demo and I'd click okay.\n\n129\n00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:57.822\n&gt;&gt; Now an interesting thing about this\nWes is that when it comes to work groups\n\n130\n00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:59.620\nverses domains with a workgroup.\n\n131\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.387\nThere is no type of authentication or try\nto prove that you're part of the group,\n\n132\n00:07:04.387 --> 00:07:07.909\nyou're one of the cool kids that\nneeds to be In that worker.\n\n133\n00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.360\nBut I just name my work\ngroup whatever I like.\n\n134\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.319\nAnd if that happens to coincide with other\npeople that have a work group of that\n\n135\n00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.107\nname, we're on the same work group, right?\n\n136\n00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:17.550\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct.\n\n137\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.570\nAnd let's go ahead and take that.\n\n138\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.936\nI'm glad you asked that too because let's\ntake a little bit further why is that\n\n139\n00:07:21.936 --> 00:07:22.505\nhappening.\n\n140\n00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:26.465\nWell, every machine in a work group\nmaintains its own user database.\n\n141\n00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:27.411\nIts own user account.\n\n142\n00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:32.100\nSo, now we've already talked about\nlocal user accounts in other episodes.\n\n143\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.220\nSo, go back and check that out.\n\n144\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.400\nBut I'll show you where those\nuser accounts are stored.\n\n145\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.814\nIf we go down to the Windows,\nor excuse me,\n\n146\n00:07:38.814 --> 00:07:41.767\nWindows Explorer file or\nExplorer, depending on,\n\n147\n00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:46.621\nits all the same if you're talking about\nVista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n148\n00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:52.311\nWe go into Computer Local Disc C,\nwe go in to Windows and\n\n149\n00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:57.013\nthen system32 and\nthen we go in to config and\n\n150\n00:07:57.013 --> 00:08:01.867\nyou need to be an administrator\nto get in here.\n\n151\n00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:03.824\nAnd we will see this file right here.\n\n152\n00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.168\nThis is called the SAM file.\n\n153\n00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:08.477\nThe SAM file is the security\naccounts manager file.\n\n154\n00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:13.356\nAnd it's where the user accounts\nare stored within this machine that's in\n\n155\n00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:14.445\nthe workgroup.\n\n156\n00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:19.640\nIn a domain setting, right, this domain\nsetting, my user accounts aren't stored.\n\n157\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.886\nWell, local users are.\n\n158\n00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:25.881\nBut this administrator that we logged into\nthat had demo backslash administrator,\n\n159\n00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.271\nwell, that's actually stored\nover here on the server.\n\n160\n00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:33.991\nAnd if I get logged into the server,\nall right, then you don't have to\n\n161\n00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:38.480\nknow about Active Directory by any means,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n162\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.041\nI just want to show you,\nfor the purposes of log in,\n\n163\n00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:42.960\nwhy Dan's absolutely correct here.\n\n164\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.270\nIf I go to Active Directory Users and\nComputers,\n\n165\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.220\nthen essentially what's happening\nhere is this administrator,\n\n166\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.730\nits account is stored here,\nover on the server, right.\n\n167\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.097\nAnd I can create users in a domain\nin the centralized model, right.\n\n168\n00:08:59.097 --> 00:09:02.387\nAnd that's the difference between\na decentralized workgroup, and\n\n169\n00:09:02.387 --> 00:09:04.610\nhow the workgroup works,\nversus the domain.\n\n170\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.120\nAnd that's why Dan's right.\n\n171\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.700\nIf it's a domain on the other\nside of that tracks, right,\n\n172\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.530\nif it's the domain environment, I have to\nhave some kind of administrative rights,\n\n173\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.860\nor at least a user within this\ndatabase that we see in front us,\n\n174\n00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.620\nin order to be able to\nlogin to the domain.\n\n175\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.440\nSo great question there.\n\n176\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.455\nAll right, so that is a little bit\nabout your workgroup and domain.\n\n177\n00:09:25.455 --> 00:09:28.320\nThere's one of the post settings that\nwe have to talk about that I really\n\n178\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.450\ndidn't mention here.\n\n179\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.280\nAnd I wanted to go back and\n\n180\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.428\njust kinda brief over it because it\nis called out in the objectives here.\n\n181\n00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:38.900\nNow, the other thing that\nI also want to talk about,\n\n182\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.680\nI talked about a clean installation,\nright.\n\n183\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.276\nAnd we kinda skipped over what's\nknown as an upgrade installation.\n\n184\n00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:47.339\nNow, I will tell you that the upgrade\ninstallation can take a while.\n\n185\n00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:52.350\nAnd for the most part really isn't much\ndifferent than the clean installation.\n\n186\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.170\nHowever, how you start is\na little bit different,\n\n187\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.500\nand that's why I want you to be careful.\n\n188\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.197\nRemember when we did\nthe clean installation?\n\n189\n00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:03.495\nAll I did was I boot to the media, and\nI tell it exactly where I want to install.\n\n190\n00:10:03.495 --> 00:10:04.652\nI load drivers if I need to.\n\n191\n00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:08.034\nAnd I point to the location in\nwhich we're gonna store it,\n\n192\n00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:12.200\nright, on whatever the hard\ndrive is on the partition.\n\n193\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.712\nAll right, let's go ahead and let's\ntake a look at my Windows machine here\n\n194\n00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:19.310\nbecause this is how you would\ndo an upgrade installation.\n\n195\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:24.000\nAll right, if I was to choose upgrade\nwhen we had upgrade or custom choose,\n\n196\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.776\nit would have failed if I chose upgrade.\n\n197\n00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:29.470\nAnd it would have said it can't install\nit, can't perform an upgrade from here.\n\n198\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.920\nBecause what you have to do is you have\nto put your installation media into\n\n199\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.620\nthe optical disc in this case, all right,\nor a USB thumb drive if it's bootable.\n\n200\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:44.260\nAnd I have to point it and launch it\nfrom inside of the operating system.\n\n201\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.780\nAnd this is a Windows 7 machine.\n\n202\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.560\nAnd you can see here I\ngot a Windows 8 machine.\n\n203\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.505\nAnd what it does is it goes through\nthe process of preparing the installation.\n\n204\n00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:56.080\nIt gives me the ability\nto perform it from here.\n\n205\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.870\nNow, I should be doing the download and\ninstall updates, right,\n\n206\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.080\nbecause what it's gonna do is\nit's gonna look at the hardware.\n\n207\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.740\nIt's gonna look at the current\nconfiguration of the applications.\n\n208\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.220\nAnd it's gonna say, hey, let's reach out\nto Microsoft right now and see if they've\n\n209\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.690\ngot any additional software and updates\nthat you should apply to this machine as\n\n210\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.510\npart of the upgrade process to make it run\nmore smoothly and to add more stability.\n\n211\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.064\nI'm just gonna say no on this and\nI'm gonna choose Next.\n\n212\n00:11:22.064 --> 00:11:25.723\nAnd here it gives me the ability\nto enter my product keys, right.\n\n213\n00:11:25.723 --> 00:11:27.550\nNow, I don't have any product key.\n\n214\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.037\nAnd I'm not gonna go through this whole\ninstallation because the installation,\n\n215\n00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:34.523\nagain, other than the first two radio\nclicks that you see, radio buttons there,\n\n216\n00:11:34.523 --> 00:11:35.748\nit's pretty much the same.\n\n217\n00:11:35.748 --> 00:11:38.338\nBut notice that I had to\nlaunch it from within\n\n218\n00:11:38.338 --> 00:11:42.842\nthe operating system versus the\ninstallation media where we chose custom.\n\n219\n00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:47.070\nSo I did wanna just kinda call that out so\nyou would be aware of it on the exam.\n\n220\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.031\nNow, upgrades, let's go ahead and\nlet's continue along the path of upgrades.\n\n221\n00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:55.920\nAnd let's talk about something\nknown as upgrade paths, all right.\n\n222\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.060\nUpgrade paths are something that are very,\nvery important when you are considering\n\n223\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.180\nwhether an operating system can be\nupgraded or not because you don't always\n\n224\n00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.850\nget the ability to pick and choose which\noperating systems you can upgrade to.\n\n225\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.150\nNow here's what I mean.\n\n226\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.555\nAll right, you'll notice that I have a\nVista, I have a little chart here, right.\n\n227\n00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:18.400\nAnd we have Windows Vista,\nservice pack one and service pack two.\n\n228\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:25.080\nIf you have Home Basic,\nyou can upgrade to Windows 7 Home Basic,\n\n229\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.630\nHome Premium, and Ultimate.\n\n230\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.790\nBut, notice, if you have Home Premium,\nyou're not gonna upgrade to Home Basic.\n\n231\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.278\nThat's actually a downgrade,\nit's not an upgrade, right.\n\n232\n00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:35.670\nSo you have to be careful with this.\n\n233\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.530\nNow, my head's kinda\ncovering up this slide here.\n\n234\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.529\nSo one of the things that I want you\nto keep in mind is notice Business.\n\n235\n00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:45.662\nBusiness doesn't upgrade\nfrom Vista to Home Premium.\n\n236\n00:12:45.662 --> 00:12:47.781\nThat's essentially considered a downgrade.\n\n237\n00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:52.700\nBut the professional edition of Windows\n7 is a lot like Business was in Vista.\n\n238\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.080\nSo it has the underlying architecture.\n\n239\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.850\nYou could, if you have a volume license,\nyou could go to Enterprise or\n\n240\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.950\nUltimate and get all the features.\n\n241\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.570\nNow, if you start out with an Enterprise\nedition, Enterprise to Enterprise is\n\n242\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.370\nthe only way you can go because\nit's a volume license agreement.\n\n243\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.530\nI kind of mention that here just so\nyou guys are aware of it.\n\n244\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.095\nNow, notice if you've\nalready got Vista Ultimate,\n\n245\n00:13:14.095 --> 00:13:16.436\nyou can upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate,\nright.\n\n246\n00:13:16.436 --> 00:13:18.090\nCuz they're not gonna let you downgrade.\n\n247\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.970\nIt doesn't really make sense\nto have the highest or\n\n248\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.290\nthe most features within Windows and\nthen turn around and downgrade.\n\n249\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.390\nNow, you also have what are known\nas in-place upgrades, all right.\n\n250\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.401\nThat's a different type of upgrade.\n\n251\n00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:31.716\nIt says I've already got Windows.\n\n252\n00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:35.722\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna upgrade my Windows 7 box\n\n253\n00:13:35.722 --> 00:13:39.122\nto a higher level edition,\nright, more features.\n\n254\n00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:43.310\nNotice that I can upgrade Starter to\nHome Premium, Professional or Ultimate.\n\n255\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.769\nNotice Home Basic goes to Home Premium,\nagain, cuz it's an upgrade,\n\n256\n00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:48.165\nProfessional or Ultimate.\n\n257\n00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:50.382\nThere should be a comma there,\nI'm missing a comma.\n\n258\n00:13:50.382 --> 00:13:56.050\nHome Premium, I can go to Professional,\nand I can go to Ultimate as well.\n\n259\n00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.020\nNotice that Enterprise\nis nowhere in this list.\n\n260\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.260\nThat's because if we have Enterprise,\nthere's nothing to upgrade to.\n\n261\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.630\nYou already have all the same features\nthat you have in Ultimate and\n\n262\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.290\nEnterprise are identical.\n\n263\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.480\nThe difference is volume licensing\nmeans you through Microsoft\n\n264\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.060\nbecause you're a corporation that can say,\n\n265\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:20.020\nhey I need more than 250 operating\nsystems in a given life cycle of that OS.\n\n266\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.160\nProfessional, right, it does lack\nsome of the features of Ultimate, so\n\n267\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.950\nan upgrade would be to Ultimate.\n\n268\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.830\nNow, the same thing goes\nwith Windows 7 to Windows 8.\n\n269\n00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.060\nNow, one of the great things about Windows\n8, though, is that you only really have\n\n270\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.430\nthree editions of Windows 8 so\nit makes it easier for the test.\n\n271\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.532\nStarter can go to Windows 8, which is kind\nof like their Home Edition cuz they just\n\n272\n00:14:39.532 --> 00:14:42.394\ndon't call it Home Edition anymore,\nor Windows 8 Pro.\n\n273\n00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:44.780\nNotice Basic, same thing.\n\n274\n00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.880\nHome Premium, same thing, got to love it.\n\n275\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.630\nIt makes it a lot easier to remember for\nthe exam.\n\n276\n00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.540\nNotice Professional, well, guess what?\n\n277\n00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.700\nProfessional to Professional.\n\n278\n00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.630\nUltimate to Professional.\n\n279\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.500\nSo, again,\nthis list gets a little bit smaller.\n\n280\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.724\nI like what they've done as\nthey've gone to the newer models.\n\n281\n00:14:59.724 --> 00:15:03.451\nYou don't have hundreds of models to\nremember, right, or editions, excuse me.\n\n282\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.420\nNotice Windows 8,\nwe can also upgrade to Windows 8.1.\n\n283\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.870\nAgain, Windows 8 can go to 8.1 or 8.1 Pro.\n\n284\n00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.846\nWindows 8 Pro goes to Window 8.1 Pro.\n\n285\n00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:17.815\nAnd then they also add this one-off\ntype of edition that's not available,\n\n286\n00:15:17.815 --> 00:15:20.493\nI believe,\nin Windows 8 Pro anymore, or 8.1.\n\n287\n00:15:20.493 --> 00:15:24.250\nAnd that's Windows 8\nPro with Media Center.\n\n288\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.355\nThat could also be upgraded\nto Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\n289\n00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:28.730\nNow, guess what?\n\n290\n00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.410\nIt's a little bit easier when\nyou looks at Windows 8.1,\n\n291\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.800\n[LAUGH] if you have Windows 8.1.\n\n292\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Make it real simple.\n\n293\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.070\nYou could upgrade to Pro.\n\n294\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.020\nThat's exactly it.\n\n295\n00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.670\nSo I know that seems like a lot,\nI realize that.\n\n296\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.940\nBut it might be something that they call\nout on the exam because when you are gonna\n\n297\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.090\ninstall Windows, you have to know what\nthe appropriate methods are gonna be.\n\n298\n00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.510\nNow, speaking of appropriate methods,\n\n299\n00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.230\nthe last thing I wanna\ncall out is partitioning.\n\n300\n00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.558\nAll right, and\nwhen we look at partitioning,\n\n301\n00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:57.857\nwhat we have to understand is that kind of\nlike we've talked about in other episodes,\n\n302\n00:15:57.857 --> 00:16:00.084\nwe mentioned disk management, all right.\n\n303\n00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:04.858\nAnd in disk management, when you have\nto install your operating system,\n\n304\n00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:09.096\nwe do wanna talk about a couple\ndifferent disk Types, all right?\n\n305\n00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:13.390\nYou have what are known as Basic Disks and\nyou have what are known as Dynamic Disks.\n\n306\n00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.290\nAll right, now you can see Disk 0 here,\nthis is actually a Basic Disk.\n\n307\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.410\nWhat is a Basic Disk?\n\n308\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:23.360\nA Basic Disk follows the old\ntraditional PC BIOS format.\n\n309\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.568\nIt uses something known as\nMaster Boot Record, all right?\n\n310\n00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:29.580\nNow l'm get into the Master Boot Record\nhere, in just a moment, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.924\nMaster Boot Record has it's limitations.\n\n312\n00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:35.190\nWhen you do a Basic Disk, essentially,\nwhat you get are four partitions,\n\n313\n00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.580\nall right?\n\n314\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.270\nNow, we can get around\nthe four-partition limitation, and\n\n315\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.900\nwe can create three primary partitions.\n\n316\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.689\nA Primary Partition is a partition that\n\n317\n00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:49.602\nallows you to basically have a file\nsystem applied to it, all right?\n\n318\n00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:54.418\nIf you take a Basic Disk and\nyou format it, and then divide it up into\n\n319\n00:16:54.418 --> 00:16:59.064\nfour partitions, and\nyou apply operating systems to them all,\n\n320\n00:16:59.064 --> 00:17:03.150\nthat would essentially be your limitation.\n\n321\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.840\nHowever, one of the things that you can\ndo, is you can make one of those four\n\n322\n00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.920\npartitions, what's known\nas an extended partition.\n\n323\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.664\nThe extended partition essentially allows\nyou to take that extended partition, and\n\n324\n00:17:13.664 --> 00:17:16.525\nthen further divide it up into\nwhat are known as logical volumes.\n\n325\n00:17:16.525 --> 00:17:19.647\nIt's one of the ways\nWindows kinda gets around\n\n326\n00:17:19.647 --> 00:17:23.300\nthat old four primary\npartition limitation.\n\n327\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.690\nRight, so\nthose are called logical volumes.\n\n328\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:32.760\nHowever, what you don't get are the better\nfeatures of what a Dynamic Disk gives you.\n\n329\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.398\nRemember on other episodes,\nwe should you how to add an array,\n\n330\n00:17:36.398 --> 00:17:40.180\nessentially a software based array,\nwe did a striped disk.\n\n331\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.810\nBut I would have the ability potentially,\nto and\n\n332\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.880\nit doesn't actually\nshow it to you on here.\n\n333\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:52.640\nBut I would have the ability to create a\nstriped, or a span, or a mirrored volume.\n\n334\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.180\nAnd I would basically be able to\ncreate a volume out of multiple disks.\n\n335\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.610\nWell, that takes what's\nknown as a Dynamic Disk.\n\n336\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.520\nAnd if I convert this to Dynamic Disk,\n\n337\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.640\nessentially what I do is I get\naround those limitations, right?\n\n338\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.276\nAnd let's see here,\nmight cause problems on this.\n\n339\n00:18:10.276 --> 00:18:12.922\nNo, it didn't give me a hard time,\nyou gotta be careful with it and\n\n340\n00:18:12.922 --> 00:18:15.358\nyou gotta pay attention to\nyour compatibility, all right?\n\n341\n00:18:15.358 --> 00:18:19.144\nSo what this does is this allows me\nnow that if I have additional disks,\n\n342\n00:18:19.144 --> 00:18:22.430\nwhat I could do is I can aggregate\nthem together, all right?\n\n343\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.250\nAnd I also get up around that two-terabyte\n\n344\n00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.630\nlimitation that we talked\nabout in another episode.\n\n345\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.478\nSo you also have the ability\nto use Dynamic Disks.\n\n346\n00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:38.710\nNow, Dynamic Disks, keep in mind,\njust allow for a lot better flexibility.\n\n347\n00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.210\nNow, the other thing that I wanna\ntalk about briefly, I mentioned MBR.\n\n348\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:49.027\nNow, MBR isn't on the exam, but\nGPT is, and I wanna talk about both.\n\n349\n00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:53.535\nCuz to me it doesn't really make sense to\nmention one and not mention the other.\n\n350\n00:18:53.535 --> 00:18:54.887\nWhy would we even move to GPT?\n\n351\n00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:57.105\nWhat does that even mean?\n\n352\n00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:59.275\nAll right, well, for\nthe longest time the boot code,\n\n353\n00:18:59.275 --> 00:19:02.442\nthe master boot code that\nwe've been utilizing,\n\n354\n00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:07.845\nwell BIOS has utilized what's known as\na Master Boot Record, all right, an MBR.\n\n355\n00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:11.295\nNow an MBR has a flaw in it, and\nit really has some limitations.\n\n356\n00:19:11.295 --> 00:19:15.619\nYou have to understand that when BIOS\nwas first invented it, was invented for\n\n357\n00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:18.930\n16-bit systems in 1976, all right?\n\n358\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.200\nWe're a lot farther past 1976,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n359\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:28.281\nSo, Intel came out with what was known as\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n360\n00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:30.300\nAnd they wanted it to become\nan industry standard.\n\n361\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.970\nSo they kinda gave it order to a\nconsortium of multiple manufacturers, and\n\n362\n00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.170\nthey all worked together to\nkinda promote the standard.\n\n363\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.063\n&gt;&gt; Seems like a really worked out forum.\n\n364\n00:19:37.063 --> 00:19:38.362\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It, yeah it really has.\n\n365\n00:19:38.362 --> 00:19:42.956\nThey've done that before where they've\ncome up with something that they've given\n\n366\n00:19:42.956 --> 00:19:43.990\nout to the public,\n\n367\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.360\nand essentially it becomes a unified or\na consortium that gets standardized.\n\n368\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.991\nSo today,\n\n369\n00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:53.769\nwhat we have is what's known as the the\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n370\n00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:59.050\nIt had it's start with Intel's\nfirst UEFI based systems.\n\n371\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.704\nBut now, to kind of distinguish\nthe two that it's an open market, or\n\n372\n00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:07.720\nan open standard, that they call it\nUnified Extensible of Firmware Interface.\n\n373\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.428\nNow, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\ndoesn't use an MBR, all right,\n\n374\n00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:12.880\nit uses what's known as a GPT.\n\n375\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.560\nAnd that is called out on the exam,\na GUID partition table.\n\n376\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.050\nI wanna compare the two so\nyou know what's going on here.\n\n377\n00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.370\nWell this is an example of\na Master Boot Record or MBR.\n\n378\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.360\nAnd in the first portion of this code, you\nhave what's known at the master boot code.\n\n379\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.250\nThen you have what's known as\na master partition table and\n\n380\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.327\nit limits it to 4 partitions.\n\n381\n00:20:34.327 --> 00:20:36.440\nWe set a 4 primary partition limitation,\n\n382\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.710\na primary partition just means it\nhas file system applied to it, okay?\n\n383\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.940\nNow, if I take one of these partitions,\nI can create an extended partition and\n\n384\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.666\nthen essentially turn these\ninto logical volumes, and\n\n385\n00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.298\ndivide it up the way I want, all right?\n\n386\n00:20:52.298 --> 00:20:55.160\nThen the last portion of this\nis called an end-of-sector.\n\n387\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.870\nIt tells you the end-of-sector,\nit's an end-of-sector marker, all right?\n\n388\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.910\nNow that being said,\nhere's another limitation.\n\n389\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.321\nNot only is there a 4\nprimary partition limitation,\n\n390\n00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:07.850\nthere's also a 2 terabyte\nlimitation in the volumes.\n\n391\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.300\nThe other thing to keep in mind too,\n\n392\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.400\nis that Master Boot Record\ncould be corrupted.\n\n393\n00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.070\nAnd if it was corrupted,\nthe system would fail to Bootstrap.\n\n394\n00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.070\nIt would fail to boot the operating\nsystem, cuz BIOS would say I\n\n395\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.000\nfound the Master Boot Record, I don't\ncare what the condition is, I found it.\n\n396\n00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.574\nMy job's done.\n\n397\n00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:26.070\nAnd then the operation\nsystem would fail to boot.\n\n398\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.950\nSo they came out with a replacement to it.\n\n399\n00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.450\nAnd I'll kinda tell you\nguys what's going on here.\n\n400\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.202\nYou don't have to know all of this\ninformation because there's two\n\n401\n00:21:33.202 --> 00:21:35.238\nportions of this that are very,\nvery important.\n\n402\n00:21:35.238 --> 00:21:38.030\nBut if for those of you that are going\non to more advanced training, or\n\n403\n00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.355\nare gonna continue on and wanna know this\ninformation, at least here at ITProTV,\n\n404\n00:21:41.355 --> 00:21:43.268\nwe can say we have given\nyou this information.\n\n405\n00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:47.148\nGPT is what's known as a GUID\npartition table, all right?\n\n406\n00:21:47.148 --> 00:21:50.020\nAnd a GUID partition\ntable doesn't have the 4\n\n407\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.870\nprimary partition limitation if you will,\nthat the Master Boot Record does.\n\n408\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.490\nIn fact, you'd get up to a 128 partitions.\n\n409\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.274\nSo again, it kinda blows that whole\nlimitation completely out of the water,\n\n410\n00:22:01.274 --> 00:22:01.867\nall right?\n\n411\n00:22:01.867 --> 00:22:06.110\nNow, it does, at the first part of this,\nhave a protected MBR.\n\n412\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.900\nAnd that's because a lot of\nthe utilities that you have\n\n413\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.840\nunderstand a Master Boot Record.\n\n414\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.880\nThey don't understand the GUID\npartition table, all right?\n\n415\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.800\nWell, this Protected Master Boot Record\nis there and it cannot be modified.\n\n416\n00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.343\nThe other thing is, it has what's\nknown as a Primary GPT Header,\n\n417\n00:22:22.343 --> 00:22:26.340\nwhich is those GUIDs, those globally\nunique identifiers that tells us,\n\n418\n00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.510\nagain, where are these partitions?\n\n419\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.750\nThey're essentially entries.\n\n420\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.461\nNow, here's what's really cool about this,\nand I want you guys to know.\n\n421\n00:22:34.461 --> 00:22:37.659\nIt also has what's known\nas a second GPT Header,\n\n422\n00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:41.560\nwhich is kinda like the master\npartition table is in an MBR.\n\n423\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.330\nWhat does the GPT Header do,\nthe secondary one?\n\n424\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.780\nWell, it's protected.\n\n425\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.779\nAnd it's for fault tolerance,\nit's for redundancy.\n\n426\n00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:54.955\nIf for some reason, this Primary GPT\nHeader gets corrupted in any way,\n\n427\n00:22:54.955 --> 00:22:58.753\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface\nsystems can\n\n428\n00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:03.515\ncontinue to boot by using\nthe Secondary GPT Header as a failback.\n\n429\n00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:08.138\nAnd they can continue to Bootstrap the\noperating system, and then this GPT Header\n\n430\n00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:13.020\ncan actually overwrite the corrupted one,\nbringing it back to a good state.\n\n431\n00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.350\nSo we have fault tolerance and redundancy.\n\n432\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.160\nAnd that's the GPT, so again,\nthere's a lot information in here,\n\n433\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.280\nI know ladies and gentlemen.\n\n434\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.890\nI don't want you to worry so\nmuch about that.\n\n435\n00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.877\nMore so, that I want you to\nunderstand that UEFI systems use GPT,\n\n436\n00:23:26.877 --> 00:23:29.426\nBIOS systems use the Master Boot Record.\n\n437\n00:23:29.426 --> 00:23:34.631\nUnderstand the limitations of the Master\nBoot Record, also understand some\n\n438\n00:23:34.631 --> 00:23:39.608\nof the things that GPT, the limitations\nthat GPT allows you to overcome.\n\n439\n00:23:39.608 --> 00:23:43.718\nUp to a 128 partitions,\ndrives well beyond 2 terabytes, and\n\n440\n00:23:43.718 --> 00:23:46.272\nthe fact that we do get some redundancy.\n\n441\n00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:49.437\nAll right, last thing that I wanna\ntalk about, just real quick,\n\n442\n00:23:49.437 --> 00:23:51.120\nare the file systems that we have.\n\n443\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.823\nThey call out a few of them.\n\n444\n00:23:52.823 --> 00:23:57.064\nI want you guys to know a little bit about\nthe file system types that you guys have\n\n445\n00:23:57.064 --> 00:24:00.149\naccess to, and\nthe ones that you should be formatting for\n\n446\n00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:02.610\nyour Windows operating system, all right?\n\n447\n00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.402\nThey call out on the exam exFAT,\nFAT32, NTFS, right?\n\n448\n00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:07.956\nThese are the ones that\nwe use inside of Windows.\n\n449\n00:24:07.956 --> 00:24:10.484\nHow, why and where we use them.\n\n450\n00:24:10.484 --> 00:24:14.329\nNTFS is the file system of choice for\nWindows.\n\n451\n00:24:14.329 --> 00:24:15.421\nIt's what you should be using.\n\n452\n00:24:15.421 --> 00:24:17.589\nIt's the default file system, right?\n\n453\n00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:24.260\nEssentially, it does have support for\ndata integrity checks, right?\n\n454\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.000\nIt has support for permissions,\nit also has support for\n\n455\n00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.730\nencryption and compression as well.\n\n456\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.870\nEven though compression isn't so important\ntoday with the fact that our drive sizes\n\n457\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.950\nare just astronomically large today.\n\n458\n00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.640\nBut when this came out,\ndrive compression was still important,\n\n459\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.070\nbecause drives were\nstill relatively small.\n\n460\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:48.160\nBut it also has support for ACLs, access\ncontrol lists, or permissions if you will,\n\n461\n00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.502\nas well as encryption,\nthe ability to protect the information.\n\n462\n00:24:52.502 --> 00:24:59.645\nExfat, Exfat is a proprietary file system\nthat was basically invented by Microsoft.\n\n463\n00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:03.102\nIt is adopted, if you will,\nby the SD Card Association,\n\n464\n00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:06.566\nthe ones that oversee the micro\nSD card specifications.\n\n465\n00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:10.244\nAnd it's supported not only in Windows,\nbut it is supported in Dynamo and\n\n466\n00:25:10.244 --> 00:25:11.144\nMacBook as well.\n\n467\n00:25:11.144 --> 00:25:16.272\nSo, if you need to move files between\nMac and Windows, use Exfat, right?\n\n468\n00:25:16.272 --> 00:25:19.600\nBecause it'll be recognized\nby your Mac system too.\n\n469\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.297\nFAT32, FAT32 is an older of file system.\n\n470\n00:25:23.297 --> 00:25:26.163\nIt does have a couple of\nlimitations to it, but\n\n471\n00:25:26.163 --> 00:25:30.427\nit is widely supported just by\nabout everything including cameras,\n\n472\n00:25:30.427 --> 00:25:33.380\nincluding your different\noperating systems.\n\n473\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.930\nIt's got a lot of support.\n\n474\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.450\nAll right, it has a maximum volume size\nof two terabytes, be careful with that.\n\n475\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.173\nAll right,\n\n476\n00:25:40.173 --> 00:25:44.880\nthe other thing to keep in mind is it has\na maximum file size of four gigabytes.\n\n477\n00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.080\nSo those of you out there that\nlike your high definition video,\n\n478\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.340\nif you're transferring anything over four\ngigs, which is really easy to do today,\n\n479\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.863\nin today's day and age,\nyou can't use FAT32.\n\n480\n00:25:55.863 --> 00:26:00.881\nIt doesn't have integrity checks, which\nmeans you can get file corruption very\n\n481\n00:26:00.881 --> 00:26:06.071\neasily with FAT32, unlike some of the\nother file systems that we have out there.\n\n482\n00:26:06.071 --> 00:26:08.240\nAnd it lacks security support.\n\n483\n00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.020\n&gt;&gt; You don't get permissions,\nyou don't get encryption, all right?\n\n484\n00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.210\nSo it lacks security support.\n\n485\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.338\nThere are a few other\nones that they call out,\n\n486\n00:26:15.338 --> 00:26:17.818\nthat you're not gonna be using in Windows,\nright?\n\n487\n00:26:17.818 --> 00:26:19.510\nAnd what am I talking about.\n\n488\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.770\nWell, not natively, by any means.\n\n489\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.669\nFirst of all, I'll get EXT3 and EXT4.\n\n490\n00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:29.629\nIn fact, Dan being a Linux guy here,\nhe looked at this list and he was like.\n\n491\n00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:32.415\n[CROSSTALK] Right?\n\n492\n00:26:32.415 --> 00:26:35.430\nThese essentially are Linux file systems.\n\n493\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:41.470\nEXT3 and EXT4, again they resemble UFS,\nthe Unix File System.\n\n494\n00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.607\nJust know that okay,\nthey're gonna be use in Windows.\n\n495\n00:26:45.607 --> 00:26:47.758\nThey're not gonna be use in Windows.\n\n496\n00:26:47.758 --> 00:26:51.270\nNFS is the network file system.\n\n497\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.225\nIt was invented back in 1984\nby Sun Microsystems back when\n\n498\n00:26:55.225 --> 00:26:57.514\nSun Solaris Unix-based systems.\n\n499\n00:26:57.514 --> 00:27:01.687\nAgain, it's similar to things like\nserver message block, if you will,\n\n500\n00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:03.639\ncommon Internet file system, and\n\n501\n00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:08.039\nApple file link system too, it used to\nbe called AppleTalk, as well as CDFS.\n\n502\n00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:12.200\nCDFS was really for\naudio more than it was for anything.\n\n503\n00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.600\nIt later supported data too.\n\n504\n00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.150\nAnd it's not called out in the objectives\nhere but I might as well, go ahead and\n\n505\n00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.770\nmention that's universal disc format too.\n\n506\n00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.820\nIn the show notes, if you want, I have\nsome more of the specifics when it comes\n\n507\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:32.940\nto, for instance, knowing that EX3 has\na maximum volume size between 4 and\n\n508\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.560\n32 terabytes, file size 16 gigabytes\nall the way up to 2 terabytes.\n\n509\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.280\nI don't know if you're gonna need to\nknow that level of detail on the exam.\n\n510\n00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.430\nSo Dan, what I've done is I went ahead and\nput them in the show notes.\n\n511\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.320\nAnd if you want a little\nbit more information and\n\n512\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.570\nyou wanna kinda really get into\nwhat the maximum volume size is.\n\n513\n00:27:53.570 --> 00:28:00.555\nI will mention NTFS here just for the\nexam, because we are in a Windows show.\n\n514\n00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:04.465\nMaximum volume size for\nMBR-based disks is gonna be two terabytes.\n\n515\n00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:06.995\nMaximum volume size for GPT,\n\n516\n00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:11.750\nremember we said that it doesn't have\nthat limitation, is 16 exabytes.\n\n517\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.541\nThat's 18 quintillion bytes if you wanna\n\n518\n00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:17.340\nkinda wrap [LAUGH] Your\nhead around that one.\n\n519\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.983\nSo again, we've got that in\nthe show notes if you guys and\n\n520\n00:28:19.983 --> 00:28:21.756\ngirls out there wanna check that out.\n\n521\n00:28:21.756 --> 00:28:23.678\nAgain if you wanna get specific for\n\n522\n00:28:23.678 --> 00:28:27.190\nthe individual things that you\nmight need to know for the exam,\n\n523\n00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.250\nknow some of the basics as well and\nyou should really be good for the test.\n\n524\n00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.410\nHowever, if you need to know it,\nit is there.\n\n525\n00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.318\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell Wes thank you so much for\n\n526\n00:28:35.318 --> 00:28:38.463\ngetting us familiar with what it\ntakes to get Windows installed and\n\n527\n00:28:38.463 --> 00:28:42.073\nsome of the upgrade paths that we can\nlook forward to if we're gonna do that.\n\n528\n00:28:42.073 --> 00:28:45.750\nAlso understanding about discs and\nformatting and partitioning.\n\n529\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.906\nAlways good stuff to throw on the fire,\ncuz when you're installing an operating\n\n530\n00:28:49.906 --> 00:28:54.078\nsystem, it's things that you're actually\ngoing to have to do and understand.\n\n531\n00:28:54.078 --> 00:28:57.130\nSo definitely pay attention\nto that part of the series.\n\n532\n00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.190\nBut we are at the end of the little\nseries inside of our normal series.\n\n533\n00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.201\nSo hopefully you guys are enjoying\nthat more as we do thank you for\n\n534\n00:29:03.201 --> 00:29:04.141\nlending your language to us.\n\n535\n00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n536\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.840\n&gt;&gt; We thank you good folks for watching.\n\n537\n00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.730\nBut it is time to sign off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n538\n00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.710\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n539\n00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.186\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next

Wesley, right?\n\n19\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.117\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is, absolutely.\n\n20\n00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:44.941\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've only known him for\nten years,\n\n21\n00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:45.668\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n22\n00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:46.921\n&gt;&gt; Well, after a decade-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n23\n00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.242\nI figured I could ask that question.\n\n24\n00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:50.994\n&gt;&gt; And of all the things I've lost and\nmissed my memory the most.\n\n25\n00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:53.904\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we are moving into, well,\n\n26\n00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:55.430\nsome more Windows tools.\n\n27\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.765\nAnd if you guys have had to suffer through\nthe Windows tool mini series that we did.\n\n28\n00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:02.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are talking about a different\n\n29\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.580\ntype of tool and more specifically what\nwe're talking about is we're gonna go away\n\n30\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.870\nfrom the graphical user interface.\n\n31\n00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:12.040\nAnd we're gonna dive into Windows\nthrough what's known as a command line\n\n32\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.890\ninterpreter.\n\n33\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.783\nNow I want you guys to understand,\nguys and gals out there.\n\n34\n00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:19.403\nIf this is the first time you've ever seen\none of these command line interpreters,\n\n35\n00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:22.109\nlet me go ahead and\ntake a trip back in time here and\n\n36\n00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.280\ntell you about my\nexperience the first time.\n\n37\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.620\nI started out as an A+ student, and\nI was going to get ready for this exam.\n\n38\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.690\nI remember the first time I seen\nthis little text-based editor or\n\n39\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.250\ndag, I would say text-based editor,\nit's not a text editor.\n\n40\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.920\nIt's more appropriately\na command line interpreter.\n\n41\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.680\nAnd the fact that all you see is text, I\nremember the first time I opened something\n\n42\n00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.850\nlike that and realized that I'm gonna\nhave to learn that to pass this exam, or\n\n43\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.290\nat least portions of it,\nmy skin started crawling, all right?\n\n44\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.480\nAnd why is that?\n\n45\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.730\nWell, we've been talking heavily\nabout Windows up until this point and\n\n46\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.410\nwe'll probably gonna continue on talking\na little bit more about Windows,\n\n47\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.760\njust to the commonality and popularity\ninside of your environments out there.\n\n48\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.170\nWhether it be the home environment or\nit be the corporate environment.\n\n49\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.050\nWith that being said,\none of the reasons it has become such\n\n50\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.570\na popular operating system is because\nof point and click technology.\n\n51\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.000\nAnd more appropriately,\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n52\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.480\nNow, that isn't anything that\nis specific to Windows, and\n\n53\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.570\nwe do want you to remember that.\n\n54\n00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.964\nRemember, when we talk about a graphical\nuser interface we're talking about there\n\n55\n00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:25.604\nare other operating systems out\nthere that have the GUI, right?\n\n56\n00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:30.549\nI think Windows actually got it's start\nby wrapping the graphical user interface\n\n57\n00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.000\naround DOS,\ndisk operating system in the earlier days.\n\n58\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.741\nWhich it was just text based input and\ntext based output, but\n\n59\n00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.502\nbecause of the popularity of the graphical\nuser interface that's one of the things\n\n60\n00:02:40.502 --> 00:02:41.324\nthat has made it.\n\n61\n00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:44.967\nSo common to have in just about every\nday computing is the fact that it's\n\n62\n00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:47.465\nIt's easier to use point and\nclick technology.\n\n63\n00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:53.193\nIt doesn't take a lot of the hard work\nto really, really learn the in depth,\n\n64\n00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:58.580\nif you will, commands that you have\nto work with the operating system.\n\n65\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.130\nSo because of that,\nit's kinda fallen out of popularity\n\n66\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.930\nmore as commonality to work with these\ncommand line interpreters, right?\n\n67\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.490\nNow, that's not to say that\nother operating systems don't\n\n68\n00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.580\nrely heavily on command line.\n\n69\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.020\nRight now understand that\nwhen I'm saying command line,\n\n70\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.160\nI'm not saying command prompt.\n\n71\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.220\nAll right, and you might say well wait\na second Wes, what are you talking about?\n\n72\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.138\nWell, when we talk about command prompt,\nI'm talking about the phrase that's\n\n73\n00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:31.072\nbasically kinda coined by Microsoft to\ndefine their command line interpreter.\n\n74\n00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's kind like they're calling it,\nyeah their naming convention,\n\n75\n00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.506\ninstead of calling it\nthe command line interpreter,\n\n76\n00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:40.950\nwe'll call it the command prompt and\nthat's Microsoft jargon.\n\n77\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwhere like Dan's a Linux guru here,\n\n78\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.970\nloves the command line but\nhe's gonna call it the terminal, right?\n\n79\n00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.230\nAnd why do we call it a terminal?\n\n80\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.554\nBecause in the earlier days when you\nwere using a DOS prompt or a terminal,\n\n81\n00:03:53.554 --> 00:03:56.507\nyou were sitting at a console\nthat had a keyboard.\n\n82\n00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:58.813\nAnd in those days you probably\ndidn't even have a mouse, right?\n\n83\n00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:02.907\nAnd all you got was this little\ntext based input, right?\n\n84\n00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:05.660\nSo that's what we're gonna dive in today.\n\n85\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.500\nBut I do want you to understand that from\nthe point of Windows and just about every\n\n86\n00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.112\noperating system, it is the operating\nsystem that you're dealing with,\n\n87\n00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:15.772\nit is just with the graphical\ninterface stripped out.\n\n88\n00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:19.290\nNow, there's a lot of power in\na command line interpreter.\n\n89\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.240\nAnd I don't care if you're talking about\nWindows command line, if you're talking\n\n90\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.960\nabout Windows next generation command\nline interface, called PowerShell, right?\n\n91\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.130\nIf you're talking about the bash\nshell inside of Linux, right.\n\n92\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.560\nBorn shell if you will, born again\nshell as they call it right, C shell.\n\n93\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.890\nAll these different types of terminals.\n\n94\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.727\nYou have a lot more that you can do,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:39.727 --> 00:04:44.623\nA lot more powerful things that you can do\nbecause you really are working directly\n\n96\n00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:46.480\nwith the operating system.\n\n97\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.930\nUnlike a graphical user interface which\ntakes that same functionality but\n\n98\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.790\nwraps the GUI around it.\n\n99\n00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.420\nAnd you have to wait for a programmer\nto maybe program in a little button\n\n100\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.260\nthat allows you that\npoint click technology.\n\n101\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.530\nAnd if that button isn't there,\n\n102\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.780\nwe lose the ability to perform\nwhatever that function is.\n\n103\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.406\nYou don't have that limitation,\nso what are your limitations?\n\n104\n00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.840\nSyntaxed, syntaxed, syntaxed, right?\n\n105\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.540\nYou all have seen, if you've been\nfollowing along with Dan and\n\n106\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.540\nI through 901 and now into 902,\nI can't type to save my life.\n\n107\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.929\nI would break a spellcheck at best,\nand I've been known to do that, right?\n\n108\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.310\nBecause well typing is not my strong suit,\n[LAUGH] well you don't\n\n109\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.790\nget that ability to make mistakes\ninside of a command line interpreter.\n\n110\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.000\nYou have to know the right commands,\nall right?\n\n111\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.620\nSo that being said let's go ahead and\nmake your skin crawl a little bit\n\n112\n00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.150\nif you have been used to just\ngraphical user interface.\n\n113\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.080\nBut at the same time, let's try to ease\nsome of the burden that is known as,\n\n114\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.480\nessentially, command line.\n\n115\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.260\nOr in this case, the Microsoft\nWindows Command Prompt, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.380\nSo I'm on a Windows 7 machine, and\nI'm gonna use a couple of different\n\n117\n00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.860\nmachines cuz largely, you might hear\npeople call it DOS prompt still, right?\n\n118\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.370\nIt's technically not DOS,\nlet's get technical just for a second.\n\n119\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.220\nDOS was a 16 bit subsystem\nthat up until XP\n\n120\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.320\nremained as a sidenote in Windows,\nall right?\n\n121\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.180\nWhen XP came out,\nthe 16 bit subsystem was thrown a way.\n\n122\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.490\nNo more 16 bit, no more DOS, right?\n\n123\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.082\nSo we have to understand,\nif somebody tells you it's a DOS prompt,\n\n124\n00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.980\nthey're using it as jargon today.\n\n125\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.880\nIt isn't Disc Operating System.\n\n126\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.400\nWhat you are see technically is Windows\nwithout the graphical user interface.\n\n127\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.370\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n128\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.552\nSo I've got my Windows 7 box,\nlet's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n129\n00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:38.900\nFew different ways that you can\nget to command prompt, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.680\nA lot of times I pin it right to the task\nbar, remember we talked in other episodes\n\n131\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.770\nabout pinning, but I want you\nto know also where to get to it.\n\n132\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.890\nA couple different ways to get to it,\nall right?\n\n133\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.800\nSo we also talked about\nrun line commands and\n\n134\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.040\nback in our Windows tools right you\nknow the episode that never stopped.\n\n135\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.490\n[LAUGH] And you could type in\nCharlie Mike Delta, right?\n\n136\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.430\nCMD, all right,\n\n137\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.385\nnow when we type in CMD notice that at\nthe top of the start menu here, right?\n\n138\n00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:06.955\nWe get our little, kinda like\na command line prompt, if you will.\n\n139\n00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:08.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looks like a little\nterminal with a C prompt-\n\n140\n00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:09.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sure does, right?\n\n141\n00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:11.055\nAnd it shows us the little root, right?\n\n142\n00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.411\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Root of the drive, and\n\n143\n00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.045\nthat's really all you get.\n\n144\n00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:15.987\nNow I do wanna talk a little bit about,\n\n145\n00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:18.978\nbecause this really comes up\nin the end of the objectives.\n\n146\n00:07:18.978 --> 00:07:22.423\nBut I really think that that is putting\nthe carriage in front of the horse, and\n\n147\n00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:24.205\nwe kinda wanna reverse that, right?\n\n148\n00:07:24.205 --> 00:07:27.810\nCuz there are two different ways to access\n\n149\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.070\ndifferent functionality\nwithin command prompt.\n\n150\n00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.970\nYou have what's a standard\ncommand prompt and\n\n151\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.720\nyou have what's known as\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n152\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.780\nAnd you're gonna use either or for\ndifferent functionalities, all right?\n\n153\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.874\nSo for instance if I just\nlaunch up CMD here, right?\n\n154\n00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:45.350\nAnd I'll go ahead and click on that.\n\n155\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.970\nI want you to notice something here,\nit tells me.\n\n156\n00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.680\nWhat does it say?\n\n157\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.710\nDoes it say that, well,\nthat this is command prompt?\n\n158\n00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.922\nNo, notice what it says right here.\n\n159\n00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:57.256\nIt says this is Microsoft Windows, and\n\n160\n00:07:57.256 --> 00:08:01.726\nit gives me the internal version that\nwe are running right here of Windows.\n\n161\n00:08:01.726 --> 00:08:03.383\nBut it doesn't say command prompt.\n\n162\n00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.599\nAnd that's one of the first things\nthat we want you to know here.\n\n163\n00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.750\nYou are running the operating system,\njust without the GUI.\n\n164\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.180\nNow, if you're learning this A plus for\ncertification endeavors and\n\n165\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.390\nyou're coming over from Linux,\nyou guys can take a nap for\n\n166\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.990\na little bit cuz this is your playground.\n\n167\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.660\nYou are ready and\nwell aware of this, right?\n\n168\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.600\nAnybody that's been using Unix\nsystems that again maybe is now\n\n169\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.589\npursuing an A plus\ncertification is aware of this.\n\n170\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.150\nBut I also want you to know,\nnotice where the context is,\n\n171\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.110\nwhere this is running from.\n\n172\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.524\nThis is running from something\nknown as the user profile.\n\n173\n00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:38.740\nUser profile sits in what's\nknown as user mode, user space.\n\n174\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.647\nWhat does that mean?\n\n175\n00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:42.734\nWell, that means user space is\nrunning as a standard user,\n\n176\n00:08:42.734 --> 00:08:46.443\ndoesn't have access to the core\nfunctionality of the operating system\n\n177\n00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.510\nthat we find within the kernel itself.\n\n178\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.230\nSo there are things that I can do here.\n\n179\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.280\nThere are things that I cannot do.\n\n180\n00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.140\nLet me see if I can do one here.\n\n181\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.693\nDan, we talked about services\nin another episode, and\n\n182\n00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:03.440\nyou had mentioned the net command, about\nbeing able to start and stop services.\n\n183\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.463\nLet's see if we can stop the principle or\nservice.\n\n184\n00:09:05.463 --> 00:09:07.615\nNow, I don't want you to\nworry about this command yet.\n\n185\n00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:08.415\nMore importantly,\n\n186\n00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:11.147\nis to understand the difference\nbetween a standard command prompt,\n\n187\n00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:14.360\nstandard user command prompt, and running\nin the context of an administrator.\n\n188\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.799\nSo we're gonna do a net, and we're gonna\ndo stop, and we're gonna do spooler.\n\n189\n00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:22.880\nAnd I want you to notice something,\nwhat does it say?\n\n190\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.210\n&gt;&gt; Access is denied\n&gt;&gt; Right, no food for you.\n\n191\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.850\nYou didn't make reservations at\nthe restaurant before you showed up.\n\n192\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.150\nNo, really,\nwhat that means is it's a standard user.\n\n193\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.252\nYou don't access to change the core\nfunctionality of the operation system.\n\n194\n00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:36.860\nSo what would you need to do?\n\n195\n00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.640\nWell, first of all, you could type exit.\n\n196\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.000\nYou used to have to do this in DOS, if you\nwanted to get out of a command prompt, or\n\n197\n00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.170\na DOS prompt.\n\n198\n00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.430\nYou don't have to do that today,\nthat's why we got the little red x button,\n\n199\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.010\nyou can actually do point and click there.\n\n200\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.940\nBut it's kind of cheating if you say\nyou're using the operating system,\n\n201\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.890\nwhile at the same time still relying\non the cursor that's on the screen.\n\n202\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.690\nSo now, what I can do is I can actually,\nI can type cmd.\n\n203\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.640\nAnd I've got a couple of\ndifferent things that I could do.\n\n204\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.920\nOne of the little keyboard shortcuts that\nI like is Ctrl+Shift+Enter, and now,\n\n205\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.690\nnotice what happens.\n\n206\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.620\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Good old UAC pops up.\n\n207\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.896\n&gt;&gt; That's right, right.\n\n208\n00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:15.250\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] we thought when we looked\nat the UAC before is letting me know\n\n209\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.650\nI'm making some sort of administrative for\nsystem level access or\n\n210\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.740\nchange to the system.\n\n211\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.910\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, right.\n\n212\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.315\nYou remember what dan's saying,\nlike we talked about in other episodes,\n\n213\n00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:24.699\nremember that little shield right there.\n\n214\n00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:27.649\nIt's an administrative level,\nthat means we're gonna make changes.\n\n215\n00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:32.145\nBut I also want you to notice here,\nnotice the program location change.\n\n216\n00:10:32.145 --> 00:10:35.766\nIt isn't running in\nthe user profile anymore.\n\n217\n00:10:35.766 --> 00:10:40.030\nIt isn't running in C:\\Users\\admin.\n\n218\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.030\nIn this case,\nthat's the username as admin\\userprofile.\n\n219\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:50.056\nNow it's running from C:\\Windows\\system32.\n\n220\n00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:52.436\nSo there's a big difference in\nthe context to where it's running.\n\n221\n00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:53.899\nAnd you can also see for\n\n222\n00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:58.454\nthe most part it doesn't look any\ndifferent except for the title bar.\n\n223\n00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:01.820\nAll right, this little part up\nhere is called the title bar.\n\n224\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.280\nNotice it says administrator.\n\n225\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.020\nWell, that should be the tell tale sign\nthat it's running as an administrative\n\n226\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.780\ncommand prompt cuz it lets you know that.\n\n227\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.070\nHowever, notice the location.\n\n228\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.350\nAgain, it starts in system32 folder.\n\n229\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.860\nNow, that's important and\nI want you to know that.\n\n230\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.520\nNow, I should do that little shortcut.\n\n231\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.640\nLet me show you something that's also\ncommon too, that you can do as well.\n\n232\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.470\nIf I type in cmd again, I could\nalso do the right click, and we can\n\n233\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.720\nrun as administrators, you have the two\noptions, standard or run as administrator.\n\n234\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.100\nNow, we're gonna do something that Dan and\nI kind of make a practice of.\n\n235\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.780\nI'm gonna fill in this question\nat the same time I'm asking it.\n\n236\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.490\nI don't even have to ask Dan,\nif he's in a Linux box,\n\n237\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.530\ndoes he always run as the root\nadministrator, the root user.\n\n238\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.450\nI know that answer, that's very dangerous.\n\n239\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.960\nThere are times when you have to, but\n\n240\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.290\nfor the most part,\nyou run as a non privileged user.\n\n241\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:56.200\nSo until we need it, I'm gonna follow\nthat same advice here in Windows,\n\n242\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:02.140\nto make sure that I don't make,\nlet's say, undesired changes.\n\n243\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.890\nCuz you guys have seen\nmy typing abilities.\n\n244\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.010\nIt happens right.\n\n245\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.090\nSyntax is important.\n\n246\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.500\n&gt;&gt; That whoops could be like a big, no,\n[LAUGH] especially if you're running\n\n247\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.930\nas administrator because, well, you're\nan admin, you must know what you're doing.\n\n248\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.430\nAnd that command you wanted me to run\nwhere I delete the c drive, sure.\n\n249\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.190\nThat's what you want.\n\n250\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.420\nThat's what you're gonna get.\n\n251\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.310\nAnd that could be bad.\n\n252\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.890\nSo typically, it's just dangerous to run\nwith all the privileges in the world,\n\n253\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:30.110\nespecially, what happens if\nsomeone hooks into you as you,\n\n254\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.040\nlike a bad actor or a threat, a malicious,\n\n255\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.150\na hacker as it were, they've hooked in and\nthey're masquerading as you, and\n\n256\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.420\nyou're running as those privileges,\nnow what can they do?\n\n257\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.440\nAnything you can do.\n\n258\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.550\nSo it's always better to\nrun with lower privileges,\n\n259\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.220\nuntil you need higher privileges.\n\n260\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, you said,\nyou don't want to hear oops, right?\n\n261\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Those are two words that you don't want\n\n262\n00:12:51.932 --> 00:12:53.795\nto hear at 4:30 on Friday\nin the server closet.\n\n263\n00:12:53.795 --> 00:12:55.547\nOops or no.\n\n264\n00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:56.349\n&gt;&gt; Or from a surgeon.\n\n265\n00:12:56.349 --> 00:12:57.410\n&gt;&gt; Or from, [LAUGH].\n\n266\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:03.350\nWell, the one that always bothers me in\nsurgery is when they put you under, and\n\n267\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:09.114\njust before you fall asleep, they say,\nhey, anybody got the user manual?\n\n268\n00:13:09.114 --> 00:13:10.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n269\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Joking aside, we got the user manual,\nI actually got some notes here,\n\n270\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.790\nso we'll be okay so.\n\n271\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.840\n&gt;&gt; I think we should get through it.\n\n272\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Now, so that's a little bit about\njust the context of running your\n\n273\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.990\ncommand prompts,\nunderstand that there are elevated NANs,\n\n274\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.350\nset it good enough,\nthat's what we wanna remember.\n\n275\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.090\nSo we're gonna do some of\nthe basic commands and\n\n276\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.480\nwe're gonna show you basic navigation.\n\n277\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.331\nThat is something that's important.\n\n278\n00:13:32.331 --> 00:13:36.150\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you a few of these commands.\n\n279\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.515\nHonestly, even though I kinda\npick on the semantics here,\n\n280\n00:13:39.515 --> 00:13:42.490\ntalking about it isn't DOS,\nsome of these go back.\n\n281\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.194\nSome of the commands you'll see go back to\nDOS and are actually used in other UNIX\n\n282\n00:13:46.194 --> 00:13:49.790\nbased systems cuz they actually follow\nthe original UNIX standard, like for\n\n283\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.800\ninstance, change directory CD command.\n\n284\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.370\nGuess what?\n\n285\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.370\nYou use CD inside of a lot\nof operating systems.\n\n286\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.800\nAnd what I mean by CD, let's go ahead and\n\n287\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.700\nunderstand that you can\ndo a command spaceboard/?\n\n288\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.140\non any command.\n\n289\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.730\nWhat that will do is it will give you some\nof the help information on how to properly\n\n290\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.380\nuse the command.\n\n291\n00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.400\nAnalytic systems and UNIX systems,\nwe have what are known as man pages or\n\n292\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.060\nyou have dash dash help.\n\n293\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.860\nThis is kind of like in Windows,\nthe forward slash question marks,\n\n294\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.420\nkind of like the dash dash\nhelp in the other systems.\n\n295\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.741\nIf I do a space,\nforward slash, forward slash,\n\n296\n00:14:24.741 --> 00:14:29.289\nI know how to type, I swear,\nI can see that I get some information.\n\n297\n00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:34.257\nNow, I do want you to understand that,\nnotice it says,\n\n298\n00:14:34.257 --> 00:14:36.914\nyou said CD, but I see CHDIR.\n\n299\n00:14:36.914 --> 00:14:40.200\nWell, this follows\nthe original UNIX system.\n\n300\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.490\nThat's change directory.\n\n301\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.110\nAnd I want you to remember on the exam.\n\n302\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.104\nI'm saying these, and\nthis is how I remembered them for my exam.\n\n303\n00:14:47.104 --> 00:14:50.952\nAnd it's also how I've taught students\nthat are gonna take the a+ exam for\n\n304\n00:14:50.952 --> 00:14:54.740\nthe last seven or eight years now,\nis that take the individual letters and\n\n305\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.270\nreplace it with\nthe functionality in your mind.\n\n306\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.703\nAnd always say that, like Dan and\nI would say CD, or we say dir it,\n\n307\n00:15:00.703 --> 00:15:04.273\nwe say the dir command, well,\ncuz we know that it means directory.\n\n308\n00:15:04.273 --> 00:15:07.801\nBut in your mind, when you're first\nusing it, don't use it as an acronym,\n\n309\n00:15:07.801 --> 00:15:11.163\nsay the individual letters and\nkinda speak it out so you can remember it,\n\n310\n00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:13.915\nit'll help you, little exam tip there.\n\n311\n00:15:13.915 --> 00:15:16.865\nSo I can see that it shows me\nsome of the information just\n\n312\n00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:20.315\nby whatever the command is, space/?\n\n313\n00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:22.705\nNow, there are other basics.\n\n314\n00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:23.455\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n315\n00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:29.155\nshow you a basic way to give yourself\na nice clear canvas here, and that's CLS.\n\n316\n00:15:29.155 --> 00:15:32.780\nThat's clear screen, again,\nremember the way I'm saying that?\n\n317\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.630\nClear screen, remember,\nit will help you on the exam.\n\n318\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.520\nIf you're in other operating systems or\neven in PowerShell, you just type clear.\n\n319\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.542\nAll right, so clear screen, right?\n\n320\n00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:45.000\n&gt;&gt; The funny thing about that,\nMike is so ingrained with using CLS,\n\n321\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.930\nbecause he's worked at Microsoft for\nso long.\n\n322\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:52.250\nNow that he's working more with Linux\nas he's diving deeper into security,\n\n323\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.880\nhe actually mapped CLS so that it would\ndo clear, because he just could not stop\n\n324\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.970\nhis muscle memory from typing cls and\nit was aggravating him.\n\n325\n00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.872\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; It was so funny.\n\n326\n00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:03.153\n&gt;&gt; Nothing like mapping\nyour own aliases so\n\n327\n00:16:03.153 --> 00:16:05.781\nyou can continue on with\nthe training wheels.\n\n328\n00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:10.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, he's like, yeah,\nI'm gonna keep my training wheels on.\n\n329\n00:16:10.445 --> 00:16:12.486\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't keep your training wheels, no,\n\n330\n00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:15.850\nwe're just picking on you for the\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n331\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.830\n&gt;&gt; So another one of the things\nthat has also continued on.\n\n332\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.020\nAnd again, this is a commonality\nacross all operating system,\n\n333\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.550\nis something known as\nthe .directory naming convention.\n\n334\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.040\nBecause a lot of people use scripts inside\nof operating systems through the command\n\n335\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.580\nline or command prompt we're in here\nin Windows to automate things right?\n\n336\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.300\nSo inside of Windows right we use\nbackslashes right when we are using\n\n337\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.650\ndots or\nwhen we're typing out stuff like paths.\n\n338\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.620\nYou might see in other operating\nsystems they use forward slashes right?\n\n339\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.020\nWell, I want to talk about dot.\n\n340\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.636\nBecause, you can do a CD dot,\nand that is actually a command.\n\n341\n00:16:53.636 --> 00:16:57.860\nIt goes back to the old\nDOS directory system.\n\n342\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.490\nWhen I run dot notice what it does.\n\n343\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.270\nCD dot, it did absolutely nothing.\n\n344\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.640\nHowever, watch what happens\nwhen I do a CD dot dot.\n\n345\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.300\nIt backs me out one directory\nto the parent directory.\n\n346\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.240\nSo I'm gonna introduce you to\nanother basic command here so\n\n347\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.800\nthat we can see what dot and dot dot\nmean for us and that's the dir command.\n\n348\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.190\nI called it the directory command.\n\n349\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.410\nYou might hear people just say hey\njust dir that for me real quick.\n\n350\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.940\nWell they're not saying dir.\n\n351\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.866\nWhat they mean is,\nshow me what's in the files and\n\n352\n00:17:27.866 --> 00:17:32.824\nfolders there within the current location\nand in this case, we're in C:\\users.\n\n353\n00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:36.445\nRight, and if you need a comparison here,\n\n354\n00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:40.880\nlet's go ahead and\nkinda help everybody out there.\n\n355\n00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.506\nIf you happen to be watching and\nyou're like wait a second, Wes.\n\n356\n00:17:44.506 --> 00:17:46.413\nI don't know about all\nthis command prompt,\n\n357\n00:17:46.413 --> 00:17:48.640\nyou're really scaring me here, right.\n\n358\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.270\nSo I want you to notice that if I,\nlet me take that library path out there.\n\n359\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.490\nThey got cookie crumb trail, breadcrumb\ntrail they call it Windows Explorer but\n\n360\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.540\nI want you to see the actual location.\n\n361\n00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.170\nThese are the same locations, right?\n\n362\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.100\nThey are identical, all right.\n\n363\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.840\nThe difference is this is without\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n364\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.630\nin Windows Explorer with\nthe user interface.\n\n365\n00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.670\nAnd let me show you,\ncuz I want you to pay attention here.\n\n366\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.460\nAll right, to, and you know what?\n\n367\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.980\nLet me just, for\nthe sake of not confusing everybody,\n\n368\n00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.810\nlet me change the folder options here.\n\n369\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.200\nBecause one of the things\nI see is hidden folders.\n\n370\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.370\nAnd we don't really have to\nget into that right here, so\n\n371\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.350\nI don't want to confuse anybody.\n\n372\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.660\nThere's a hidden folder there, and\nwe'll talk about that in a later episode.\n\n373\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.520\nNotice I have admin and public, right?\n\n374\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.410\nWell with the graphical user interface,\n\n375\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.430\nI don't have to type anything to see that,\nI just have to navigate to it, right?\n\n376\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.785\nThat's point and click.\n\n377\n00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:37.575\nHowever, you don't get that ability,\nright?\n\n378\n00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:40.237\nRemember we are talking about\njoking about by training wheels.\n\n379\n00:18:40.237 --> 00:18:43.585\nI don't get those training wheels\nhere inside of the command prompt.\n\n380\n00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:47.445\nSo what I have to do is the dir command,\nagain dir sometimes people call it.\n\n381\n00:18:47.445 --> 00:18:50.675\nWhen I run that, I want you to know.\n\n382\n00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:54.705\nNotice there we've got what,\nadmin and we got public, right?\n\n383\n00:18:54.705 --> 00:18:59.710\nAnd that is no difference than what\nwe're seeing if I can navigate\n\n384\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:05.150\ncorrectly without the snap feature\ngetting me here, admin admin.\n\n385\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Kinda hiding behind\nyour head there Wes.\n\n386\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.801\n&gt;&gt; Is it hiding behind my head there?\n\n387\n00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:09.669\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so there we go.\n\n388\n00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:10.818\nThank you very much.\n\n389\n00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:11.776\nI appreciate it.\n\n390\n00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:15.220\nAdmin and then admin, right?\n\n391\n00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.640\nBut notice that there's also this dot,\nand dot dot.\n\n392\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.140\nAnd I certainly don't see that anywhere\nin the graphical user interface.\n\n393\n00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.950\nWell that's because we have an older.\n\n394\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.840\nIt's called the dot directory\nnaming convention, right?\n\n395\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.420\nAnd when you run scripts,\n\n396\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.310\nsometimes the script has to run\nfrom its current location, right?\n\n397\n00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.569\nAnd that just means you're filling\nin the path in a text file and\n\n398\n00:19:36.569 --> 00:19:40.380\nit executes it just by calling on\nit in the command prompt, right?\n\n399\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.830\nSo that's what dot and dot dot mean.\n\n400\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.000\nDot means the current location I am in.\n\n401\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.120\nSo if I say, navigate.\n\n402\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:55.710\nWe're gonna change directories and\nI do a dot backslash .\\users.\n\n403\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.980\nAll right oop, that's not gonna work.\n\n404\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.650\nIf I do a cd dot is what I meant to do,\nright?\n\n405\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.580\nIt doesn't take me anywhere.\n\n406\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.880\nBecause what it's saying is change\ndirectories to the current location.\n\n407\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.490\nBut If I say dot, dot,\nthen what I'm saying\n\n408\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:17.520\nis whatever the parent directory is or\nfolder they're interchangeable.\n\n409\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.180\nFolders are seen inside\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n410\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.300\nDirectories are what they called in\n\n411\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.430\nthe command prompt because we don't\nget the nice little yellow envelope.\n\n412\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.290\nBut notice what the parent\nis in the hierarchy.\n\n413\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:33.750\nUsers is the child or if you will c\ncolon is the parent to users right?\n\n414\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.660\nSo that's what's called the parent\ndirectory and if I do a cd dot dot\n\n415\n00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.080\nand I hit enter, notice how it's\nbacked me out one parent location.\n\n416\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.350\nNow one of the great things is we went\none direction, one side of the tracks.\n\n417\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.140\nLet's go the other way.\n\n418\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.880\nLet's go to the other side of the tracks,\nright?\n\n419\n00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.950\nLike Dan said let's go to the dark side,\nright?\n\n420\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.532\nSo we can actually navigate by saying\n\n421\n00:20:59.532 --> 00:21:10.010\nC\\/users\\admin\\desktop,\n\n422\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.490\nand we can navigate the other way.\n\n423\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.800\nNow, to kind of show you that\nwe are working with Windows,\n\n424\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.400\nwithout the graphical user interface,\n\n425\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.950\nI'm gonna introduce you to\nanother command and that's MD.\n\n426\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.579\nThat's make directory.\n\n427\n00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:26.531\nYou an also do, MKDIR.\n\n428\n00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:28.997\nAnd again, that's just left\nover from the Unix systems.\n\n429\n00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:31.273\nThe Unix systems use\nthis naming convention.\n\n430\n00:21:31.273 --> 00:21:32.451\nSo I want you to know both but\n\n431\n00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:35.022\njust because again there's\nkind of a Windows thing there.\n\n432\n00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:40.400\nI'm gonna type MD space test for\ntest, and I'm gonna run that.\n\n433\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.300\nAnd notice what happened over on\nthe left hand side of your screen\n\n434\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.650\nunder my recycle bin right notice\nthere was test, guess what?\n\n435\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.780\nI just created a folder.\n\n436\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.510\nHowever it's called a directory\ninside of your command prompt.\n\n437\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.670\nLet me verify that right.\n\n438\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.870\nSo if I say dir show\nme all the folders and\n\n439\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.530\nfiles within the current location,\nI now have test.\n\n440\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.678\nBut yet again, I've got this pesky\nlittle dot dot dot showing up.\n\n441\n00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:07.830\nJust understand and\nthat's what we're trying to get.\n\n442\n00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.200\nWe don't want your skin crawling\nhere like it did with me.\n\n443\n00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.570\nWe want you to know some of the basics.\n\n444\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.531\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\nclear our and\n\n445\n00:22:15.531 --> 00:22:17.870\ngive us a nice clean\nscreen here if you will.\n\n446\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.930\nWe'll type CLS again.\n\n447\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.230\nAll right and I also want to show you\nthat we can do CD dot dot, right?\n\n448\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.520\nThat says take me to\nthe parent of desktop.\n\n449\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.801\nWell, the parent of desktop is admin.\n\n450\n00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:36.480\nAnd when I run that, I should see that\nthat's the location that it takes me to.\n\n451\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.670\nAnd if I do cd dot dot again, it says,\nwell, take me to the parent of admin,\n\n452\n00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.810\nwhich should be the next one\non the hierarchy, right?\n\n453\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.100\nUsers and\nthen I could also say cd dot dot again.\n\n454\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.850\nAnd we can't go any higher than the root,\nright?\n\n455\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.590\nThe root is the highest part of\nthe file hierarchy, if you will.\n\n456\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.521\n&gt;&gt; The tip of the spear.\n\n457\n00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:55.573\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely, right?\n\n458\n00:22:55.573 --> 00:22:57.169\nThat's a point of no return, right?\n\n459\n00:22:57.169 --> 00:23:00.370\nSo notice that we have now C:.\n\n460\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.700\nAll right, so that's a little bit\nof your basic navigation with CD.\n\n461\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:09.320\nBut I also wanna show you that\nyou can use command prompt and\n\n462\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.940\na lot of command line editors, and\nyou don't have to know the full path.\n\n463\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.870\nYou don't even have to\nknow the full spelling.\n\n464\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.280\nTold you guys, I would break\na word editor, a spell checker.\n\n465\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.090\nThey tremble in fear\nwhen they see me coming.\n\n466\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.200\nRight, and let me show you why because\nyou could do something like this, cd.\n\n467\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.180\nAnd I can say, so since I'm already in C:,\nit knows I'm already here.\n\n468\n00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.780\nI don't actually have to fill out\nC: because we're already in C:, but\n\n469\n00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.470\nI could and just for\nthis one example I will.\n\n470\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.340\nBut notice that we're gonna go to users.\n\n471\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.150\nWell, maybe I don't know if that user\ndirectory is the one I wanna go to.\n\n472\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.100\nI've got a few that\nstart with the letter U.\n\n473\n00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.290\nWell, notice your tab key.\n\n474\n00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:53.750\nIf I hit my tab key one time, it fills out\nthe rest of that directory for me, right?\n\n475\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.280\nAnd I can hit a backslash.\n\n476\n00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.040\nAnd I can say, admin.\n\n477\n00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.698\nRight, for admin just the letter A and\nhit tab, and\n\n478\n00:24:01.698 --> 00:24:04.261\nI can do a backslash and I can type D.\n\n479\n00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:07.696\nNow, what happens if you have\nmultiple directories in this\n\n480\n00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.175\nlocation that all start with the letter D?\n\n481\n00:24:10.175 --> 00:24:14.806\nWell guess what There's desktop,\nand there's documents, downloads,\n\n482\n00:24:14.806 --> 00:24:19.658\ndesktop, documents, downloads,\njust cycle through keep hitting tab, all\n\n483\n00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:24.503\nI'm doing is hitting tab until I find the\none that I want, and I can hit enter and\n\n484\n00:24:24.503 --> 00:24:29.010\nin one shot I've gone all the way back\nout to the location that I once was.\n\n485\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.253\nNow, what if you need to get to,\nlet's say,\n\n486\n00:24:32.253 --> 00:24:35.050\nit doesn't matter how far down\nin this directory you are.\n\n487\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.892\nIn fact, let's do a CD, and I'll do\na test, cuz I know I just created that,\n\n488\n00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:42.530\nand we'll do, make directory.\n\n489\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:47.660\nAgain, MD, we'll do test one, and\nthen we'll do a change directory,\n\n490\n00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.130\nand we'll get into test one,\nand then we'll do a, and\n\n491\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.668\nlet me show you MKDIR also works,\nand we'll do test two, and\n\n492\n00:24:55.668 --> 00:25:02.022\nthen we're gonna do a change directory and\nboy this is very monotonous, right?\n\n493\n00:25:02.022 --> 00:25:03.720\nAll right now,\nI'm doing this for a reason,\n\n494\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.600\nbecause it doesn't matter how far\nout in the hierarchy you are,\n\n495\n00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.890\nif you wanna go all the way back to\nthe root do a CD backslash and hit enter.\n\n496\n00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.040\nAnd then, clear your screen if you want.\n\n497\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.830\nI do this a lot just for my own purposes,\n\n498\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.630\njust cuz I like a nice clean canvass\nwhen I'm working on the command prompt,\n\n499\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.130\nbecause its hard enough for me to\n[LAUGH] read and type at the same time.\n\n500\n00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.952\nI can't even chew or chew bubble gum and\nwalk at the same time, I need a diagram,\n\n501\n00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:25.534\nall right.\n\n502\n00:25:25.534 --> 00:25:30.043\nSo those are and I know this seems\nlike it's very long and drawn out, but\n\n503\n00:25:30.043 --> 00:25:32.700\nyou're gonna start somewhere, right?\n\n504\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.079\nWell, you've heard probably the old\nproverbial saying that, hey,\n\n505\n00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:38.841\nyou've gotta walk or\ncrawl before you can walk, right?\n\n506\n00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.559\nYou've gotta walk before you can sprint,\n\n507\n00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:47.450\nyou've gotta sprint before you can run,\nright, you have to start somewhere.\n\n508\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.110\nSo I want you to know those basics\nthat we showed you so far, right.\n\n509\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:55.760\nWe've shown you, hey, any, any command\nthat I want to find out how to use it.\n\n510\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.850\nAll I have to do is type the command,\nspace, and a forward slash and\n\n511\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.190\na question mark.\n\n512\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.290\nLast thing, and I know we're\ncoming to the end of this one Dan.\n\n513\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.250\nLast thing,\nI wanna talk about on basic navigation and\n\n514\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.080\nbasic utilization of the command prompt,\n\n515\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.000\nis you notice that I put a space in\nsome of them, the other one's I didn't.\n\n516\n00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.920\nThere are some that you don't\nhave to put a space in,\n\n517\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.360\nlike some of the old Unix derivatives.\n\n518\n00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.820\nBut I will tell you, most commands that\nyou will enter, inside the command prompt\n\n519\n00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.620\nneed a space to add these parameters,\nthese additional options that you see.\n\n520\n00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.330\nAll right, the reason I say\nthat is because the space,\n\n521\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.650\neven though, we don't see anything,\nit's actually delimeter,\n\n522\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:42.747\nit lets the command line\ninterpreter know that hey,\n\n523\n00:26:42.747 --> 00:26:45.430\nhere is the command and\nhere is the option that I want.\n\n524\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:51.617\nSo if I was to do cdc :\\users,\nwhat it would do is it would see that,\n\n525\n00:26:51.617 --> 00:26:55.940\nas the cdc:\\user, it would look for\nthat command, right?\n\n526\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:01.030\nAnd it would say, I don't really know\nwhat you're talking about, right?\n\n527\n00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:08.240\nBut if I do cd c:\\user, it says,\nhere's the command that you want.\n\n528\n00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.650\nHere's the delimiter, so this must\nbe the path that you wanna go to.\n\n529\n00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.665\nAnd I got to spell right, send text,\nsend text, send text right,\n\n530\n00:27:16.665 --> 00:27:19.559\nsupposed to be users,\nthere we go, all right.\n\n531\n00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:24.320\nThe first part here we're\njust starting you out slow.\n\n532\n00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.500\nUnderstand that the next episode that\nwe run we're not gonna go with just\n\n533\n00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.465\nbasic navigation, we're gonna kind\nof start moving a little bit faster,\n\n534\n00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:32.000\ncuz we want to show you these commands.\n\n535\n00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.473\nBut practice this,\nmove around in the operating system.\n\n536\n00:27:35.473 --> 00:27:37.770\nIf you're not sure where to go,\n\n537\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.170\nbring up your graphical user interface,\njust like I did.\n\n538\n00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:46.267\nCompare them side by side so\nthat you don't get lost, right?\n\n539\n00:27:46.267 --> 00:27:53.018\nYes, the command prompt can be kinda\nlike,moving around in downtown city and\n\n540\n00:27:53.018 --> 00:27:57.945\na completely foreign nation\nto you at this point.\n\n541\n00:27:57.945 --> 00:28:00.445\nBut if you open up Windows Explorer and\ndo them side by side,\n\n542\n00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:04.770\nit's kinda like having a GPS system or\nyour UR here side, right?\n\n543\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.420\nAnd then you know where you are going,\nbut be careful.\n\n544\n00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.270\nRemember, just like Dan stated,\ndon't run in privileged mode.\n\n545\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.380\nDon't run in an administrative\ncommand prompt,\n\n546\n00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.350\nbecause when you do,\nyou could make changes that might\n\n547\n00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.860\nend up having to restore your operating\nsystem at the end of the day.\n\n548\n00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.810\nDan, I know that's a lot on\nthe basic navigation, but\n\n549\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.750\nwe definitely wanted to set you\nguys off on the right foot.\n\n550\n00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.994\nLooks like we're gonna move a little\nbit faster on excellent, but\n\n551\n00:28:27.994 --> 00:28:30.049\nwe're definitely gonna have to pause for\nthis one, right?\n\n552\n00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.686\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\n\n553\n00:28:30.686 --> 00:28:34.246\nwe do wanna appreciate you getting us at\nleast acclimate it to the water system.\n\n554\n00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:36.916\nThis is your first 4A into\nusing a command prompt or\n\n555\n00:28:36.916 --> 00:28:40.900\nthe command line interface built\ninto the Windows operating system.\n\n556\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.860\nThen we don't want to overwhelm you,\nright, so that's why we are starting slow,\n\n557\n00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.378\nand then on our next episode we are going\nto pick up a little more speed.\n\n558\n00:28:46.378 --> 00:28:47.850\nSo its gonna be a lot of fun,\n\n559\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.138\nit makes me feel like I am actually doing\nsomething with my computer, you know,\n\n560\n00:28:52.138 --> 00:28:56.170\nlike I'm really interacting,\nthat's why I like working in terminals and\n\n561\n00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.310\nits a lot of fun to watch the techs,\nand do stuff like that.\n\n562\n00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.960\nSo hopefully, you're enjoying it as well.\n\n563\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.920\nWe're working really hard to bring you\nguys quality stuff that is informative and\n\n564\n00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.530\nentertaining at the same time.\n\n565\n00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.545\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n566\n00:29:08.545 --> 00:29:11.630\nDo join us in part two though,\nwe got a lot more to come.\n\n567\n00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:12.479\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n568\n00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:14.540\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n569\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.734\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n570\n00:29:15.734 --> 00:29:23.401\n[MUSIC]\n\n571\n00:29:23.401 -->

00:00:12.082\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.854\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:16.582\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:20.877\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our A +\n\n7\n00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:24.050\nSeries, we've been working through it so\ndiligently.\n\n8\n00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.660\nWe're such good students, right?\n\n9\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.933\nAnd continuing our conversation on\nthe command prompt inside of Microsoft\n\n10\n00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.574\nis what we're doing today.\n\n11\n00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:34.807\nAnd joining us to continue that\nconversation, our good friend,\n\n12\n00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:35.522\nMr Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:37.573\nWes, we're glad to have you yet\nagain sir how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:38.989\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's always good to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.705\nI'm thrilled to get into\nthe next part here.\n\n16\n00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:43.520\nAnd we're gonna move a little\nbit faster in this one.\n\n17\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.170\nAnd not so\nmuch that we're trying to rush you, but\n\n18\n00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.570\nif you're not familiar with what Dan said\nhere in the last one, keep in mind that we\n\n19\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.880\nreally took the time to just kinda\nintroduce you into the command prompt.\n\n20\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.811\nSo you don't have the experience\nthat I did the first time that I\n\n21\n00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.205\ngot into the command prompt.\n\n22\n00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:59.890\nAnd I'm not kidding you ladies and\ngentlemen out there.\n\n23\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.620\nMy skin was crawling because I had never\nseen anything like that before and\n\n24\n00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.200\nso after a while getting used to it I had\na really good teacher taking the time\n\n25\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.710\nto show me through things.\n\n26\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.707\nI started to get a little\nbit more familiar with it,\n\n27\n00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:12.829\na little more comfortable.\n\n28\n00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.431\nNow if you're just tuning in to this\nsecond part here understand if you\n\n29\n00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:22.345\ndon't know anything about command\nprompt or even just some of the basics,\n\n30\n00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:24.530\nthis isn't the episode for you.\n\n31\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.320\nYou need to go back and\nwatch the first part.\n\n32\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.340\nBecause I don't want you to\nthink out there that in any way,\n\n33\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.370\nwe are trying to rush you through\nanything, that's not what we mean.\n\n34\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.720\nIt's just the fact that we're gonna move,\nwe're gonna talk about commands and\n\n35\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.230\nwe're gonna move on to the next one here.\n\n36\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.961\nSo definitely go back and\ncheck out that first part.\n\n37\n00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.578\nNow, the other thing I'd\nlike to talk about is well,\n\n38\n00:01:43.578 --> 00:01:45.217\nwith command prompt in general.\n\n39\n00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:47.490\nAnd I wanna give props\nout to our chatroom,\n\n40\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.405\nbecause in between our episodes here\nwhen we take a break for a second, and\n\n41\n00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:53.819\ngive Wes a chance to shut up and\nquit talking.\n\n42\n00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.650\n[LAUGH] Give Dan a chance to sit down for\na bit.\n\n43\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.335\nOne of our members was in the chat room,\nand\n\n44\n00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.328\nmentioned this whole\nthing about PowerShell.\n\n45\n00:02:02.328 --> 00:02:06.472\nAnd I do wanna give just a second to talk,\njust briefly, about it,\n\n46\n00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:10.172\neven though we don't really\ncall PowerShell out too much,\n\n47\n00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.286\nother than knowing what it is,\ninside of the A+.\n\n48\n00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:18.232\nPowerShell is really the latest and\nit's been around for a bit now, but\n\n49\n00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:23.580\nit is the later command line interpreter,\nif you will, inside of Windows.\n\n50\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.550\nAnd it's called PowerShell for a reason.\n\n51\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.982\nIt really allows you to do a lot.\n\n52\n00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:32.917\nIt allows you to do scripting, it allows\nyou even to do programming if you want,\n\n53\n00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.523\nit gives you direct access\nto the operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:39.204\nAnd really anything that you can\ndo here in the command prompts,\n\n55\n00:02:39.204 --> 00:02:41.249\nyou can just launch a PowerShell and\n\n56\n00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.813\nyou can run these commands inside\nof your PowerShell as well.\n\n57\n00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.320\nAnd I'm gonna tell you honestly one of the\nreasons I did wanna kind of give props to\n\n58\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.553\nthe chat room is because\nthat's what I usually do.\n\n59\n00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:52.960\nI usually would launch, and\nlet me show you what i mean here.\n\n60\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.809\nIf we could take a look at my screen.\n\n61\n00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.010\nI'm just gonna briefly do this\nbecause to me I think it's important.\n\n62\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.650\nI've actually got\nPowerShell as you can see,\n\n63\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.690\nright there on the desktop\ncuz I use it quite a lot.\n\n64\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.008\nUsually, I don't even go to command\nprompt anymore and that's because,\n\n65\n00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.339\nremember we talked about in the first\npart, we talked about CD backslash.\n\n66\n00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.310\nI can do CD backslash right here, right?\n\n67\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.479\nWe talked about CLS.\n\n68\n00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.017\nI can clear the screen right here, right?\n\n69\n00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:18.555\nWe talked about CD, and I wanted to\nmaybe change the user directory.\n\n70\n00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:22.280\nWell, I could go CD users, backslash.\n\n71\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.760\nI could do admin\\desktop, right?\n\n72\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.370\nAnd I could do all of that\nnavigation right there, right?\n\n73\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.910\nI can make directories.\n\n74\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.491\nI can even remove directories, which we're\ngoing to show you in the command prompt.\n\n75\n00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.243\nSo I want you to know that the reason\nI'm not doing that here is I don't wanna\n\n76\n00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:38.610\nconfuse anybody.\n\n77\n00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.310\nI don't want us to talk\nabout the whole series,\n\n78\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.790\nthis whole episode talk\nabout Command Prompt and\n\n79\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.220\nthen somebody get confused as to\nwhy the title bar says PowerShell.\n\n80\n00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.020\nI will say though, get used to PowerShell,\ndefinitely know your command prompt.\n\n81\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.826\nKnow your commands inside for this exam.\n\n82\n00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.758\nBut really no PowerShell as well,\n\n83\n00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:02.087\nespecially as you move on into things\nlike your Microsoft training as well and\n\n84\n00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:06.704\nthen more advanced training because it is\na great functionality utility to have.\n\n85\n00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:10.510\nSo that as a side note,\njust wanna kinda mention that here.\n\n86\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.855\nSo back to the command prompt,\nback to the task at hand.\n\n87\n00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.788\nWe talked a little bit about\nthe first one and let me go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:20.320\ndo some basic navigation here.\n\n89\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.580\nWe're gonna navigate back\nto the desktop and so we'll\n\n90\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.790\ndo admin desktop we'll do test and\nwe'll move into here right?\n\n91\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.430\nAll right so\nif I do a DIR remember that we\n\n92\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.240\nhave a lot of directories that I\nkinda created here on the fly right?\n\n93\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.540\nWe got test 1 and if I do a cd I can\nmove into test 1 if I remember right.\n\n94\n00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.002\nI think I have a test two here as well.\n\n95\n00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:48.653\nAll right, well that's CD,\n\n96\n00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:52.296\nwe may either created those\ndirectories through the MD command.\n\n97\n00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:56.254\nWe also have the RD command.\n\n98\n00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:00.515\nAnd I always remember MD as make\ndirectory and I always remember RD as\n\n99\n00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:05.298\nremove directory cuz it kinda keeps in my\nmind what we would see on the exam and\n\n100\n00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:06.975\nthe functionality of it.\n\n101\n00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:10.545\nAnd as well, what the syntax is\nbehind utilizing that command, so\n\n102\n00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.030\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n103\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.209\nIf I do an rd and I'm gonna use my tab to\n\n104\n00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:22.065\ndo the autofill here, rd test2.\n\n105\n00:05:22.065 --> 00:05:24.354\nI can actually delete that directory.\n\n106\n00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:28.396\nAnd if I do a dir again,\nyou'll notice that no longer is it there,\n\n107\n00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:31.571\nwhere it was there before,\nyou can see right here.\n\n108\n00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.757\nI do see that it's gone or it was there.\n\n109\n00:05:34.757 --> 00:05:39.881\nI run the remove directory here, right?\n\n110\n00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:46.230\nAnd if we scroll down after doing\nour last dir it is gone, right?\n\n111\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.100\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n112\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.551\nNow, I will say that sometimes if we wanna\nfind out additional options, remember, /?.\n\n113\n00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.288\nHowever, keep in mind that sometimes\nyou have to do like a little\n\n114\n00:05:59.288 --> 00:06:03.587\noverride switch because if you\ngo to remove a directory and\n\n115\n00:06:03.587 --> 00:06:06.940\nthere's files in it, it's gonna warn you.\n\n116\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.320\nIt's gonna say, hey, this isn't empty.\n\n117\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.800\nAre you sure you wanna do this, right?\n\n118\n00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.900\nSo notice it says do not ask here to\nremove a directory with s, right?\n\n119\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.206\nRemoves all directories and\nfiles and again so\n\n120\n00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:23.811\nsometimes you might have to come in\nthere and put that switch s in there and\n\n121\n00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.490\nthen quiet mode just means\ndon't prompt me, right?\n\n122\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.683\nSo hence the term quiet mode.\n\n123\n00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:29.490\nSo I do wanna make mention of that.\n\n124\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.050\nAnd again I'm not sure exactly if they're\ngonna ask you that on the exam, but\n\n125\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.040\nit could be something they do ask.\n\n126\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.774\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz in practicality it can\nalso be really good for doing scripting.\n\n127\n00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:43.325\nAs you get into more on the Command\nPrompt, you have the ability to create,\n\n128\n00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:48.013\nbasically, line by line commands\nthat you want it to perform.\n\n129\n00:06:48.013 --> 00:06:51.552\nAnd, sometimes those commands\nask you to do something.\n\n130\n00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:54.149\nBut if I can do a quiet mode,\nI don't have that.\n\n131\n00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:58.070\nAnd if you ran a script, and\nit got to somewhere it was prompting you.\n\n132\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.940\nIt would just sit there waiting for\nyou to prompt, or waiting for\n\n133\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.920\nyou to do what it's prompting you to do.\n\n134\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.840\nAnd until then it wouldn't\ngo any further so\n\n135\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.140\nyou can use those quiet type modes to just\ndo it, you don't need my interaction.\n\n136\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.070\nYou have my permission, implicitly\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, yeah.\n\n137\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.133\nThere's nothing like running a script,\nand it fails, and you can't tell why.\n\n138\n00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.207\n&gt;&gt; And then you realize,\nit's just because I asked you a question,\n\n140\n00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:17.990\nyou didn't answer me.\n\n141\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Been waiting on you, homie.\n\n142\n00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:22.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n143\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.760\nGreat little things to add.\n\n144\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; So definitely look for\n\n145\n00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:25.574\nthose switches too.\n\n146\n00:07:25.574 --> 00:07:28.566\nNow they've got a series\nof commands here as well,\n\n147\n00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:33.368\nthat I've kinda lumped together, Dan,\nbecause really when it comes down to it,\n\n148\n00:07:33.368 --> 00:07:37.844\nthey're all just about the same,\nwhich is very slight differences right.\n\n149\n00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:39.130\nAnd what am I talking about?\n\n150\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.399\nWell I'm talking about the copy command.\n\n151\n00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:44.340\nIn fact, this one isn't gonna give\nme an error unless I do put this.\n\n152\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.645\nSometimes if you put a command in and\nyou dont put the /?\n\n153\n00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:49.751\nIt says, you probably need some help,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n154\n00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:50.816\ndump out the help file for you.\n\n155\n00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:52.240\nBut in this case it didn't do that.\n\n156\n00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.352\nIt's explicitly wanting that right.\n\n157\n00:07:54.352 --> 00:07:55.728\nSo copy command.\n\n158\n00:07:55.728 --> 00:08:00.798\nThis shows you what it does, copies one or\nmore files to a different location.\n\n159\n00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:05.560\nThere's also Xcopy as well and let me\ngo ahead, let me clear the screen here.\n\n160\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.059\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\n\n161\n00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:10.789\ngive us a little bit more in our\ncanvas here known as command prompt.\n\n162\n00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:14.742\nAnd guys and girls out there the only\nreason I'm kinda doing this where I hit\n\n163\n00:08:14.742 --> 00:08:18.066\nthe button a couple of times is\ncuz I like to move things around,\n\n164\n00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:19.810\nit kinda separates them.\n\n165\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.950\nIf you guys go on later into\nnetworking and stuff like that and\n\n166\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.960\nyou're working with networking terminals\nsometimes you actually have to do that to\n\n167\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.960\nwake the session backup,\nthat's not what I'm doing here.\n\n168\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.050\nIf I do something like this,\nI just like to separate the commands out,\n\n169\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.310\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n170\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:39.340\nSo the other one is Xcopy, all right, and\nif we type Xcopy and a space, forward\n\n171\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.560\nslash, you're going to see that, well,-\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n172\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.270\nlooks like it has a little bit\nthat it can do there, Wesley.\n\n173\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n174\n00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.630\nGood catch, man.\n\n175\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.230\nGood eyes.\n\n176\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.300\n&gt;&gt; Not just, I'm going to copy\nthis file and there you go.\n\n177\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.920\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n178\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.132\nThat actually is a good preface into one\nof the big differences between copy and\n\n179\n00:08:58.132 --> 00:08:59.080\nXcopy, right?\n\n180\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.160\nExtended copy, if you will.\n\n181\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.632\nIt's got a little bit more I always\nremember it is that extreme copy.\n\n182\n00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:07.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz when we think of CPU's Intel likes\n\n183\n00:09:07.905 --> 00:09:12.380\nto put extreme CPUs called X at the end\nof whatever the model number is.\n\n184\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.033\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna do that while riding\na skateboard, down a half pipe, right?\n\n185\n00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly that.\n\n186\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.940\nSo that's one of the big\nthings about Xcopy.\n\n187\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.220\nIs when you use just the copy command,\nyou have things like ACLs,\n\n188\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.590\nattributes that\nare characteristics of a file.\n\n189\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.150\nAnd when you do the copy command it\ndoesn't carry the ACL's permissions,\n\n190\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.450\nif you will, over.\n\n191\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.070\nIt doesn't carry things like\ncompression attributes or\n\n192\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.260\nencryption attributes that also\nscramble this information.\n\n193\n00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:48.460\nThe interesting thing is, that with Xcopy,\nyou can copy directories, subdirectories.\n\n194\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.140\nSo not only files, but\ndirectories as well.\n\n195\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.760\nAnd here's a big one here, I want you to\nremember this, copies file ownership.\n\n196\n00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.361\nACL information.\n\n197\n00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:02.250\nDon't let the term ACL confuse you\nladies and gentlemen out there.\n\n198\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.990\nAccess Control list.\n\n199\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.520\nIt's a technical term for permissions but\nit also can go farther than that.\n\n200\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.350\nCopy file audit settings.\n\n201\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.440\nWe talked about event viewer.\n\n202\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.410\nIn certain situations where you're doing\nsecurity auditing from the security\n\n203\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.800\nlocation, and maybe I want to know\nwhen people are accessing this.\n\n204\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.950\nWell, that's a setting that becomes\nlike a setting on the file.\n\n205\n00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.495\nAnd if you use just the copy command,\nwell, guess what?\n\n206\n00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:30.370\n[LAUGH] It isn't going to\ninclude all of this stuff.\n\n207\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.600\nNow there are times when the Xcopy command\n\n208\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.880\nwill sometimes fail in scripting because\nyou can't do things like schedule it so\n\n209\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.490\neven it has some limitation.\n\n210\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.930\nCertainly it doesn't look limited like\nTed pointed out compared back to copy.\n\n211\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.940\nBut then that's when you go\na little bit farther, and\n\n212\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.450\nthere's actually something\nRobust Copy inside of Windows.\n\n213\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.911\nIt's actually called Robocopy, and\nI remember the first time I thought about\n\n214\n00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:00.281\nthis, I was like wait, Robocopy,\nis that Peter Weller's copy protocol?\n\n215\n00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Part man, part machine, all Windows?\n\n216\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.261\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n217\n00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:03.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And for\n\n218\n00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.014\nthose of you that are like,\nwhat are they talking about?\n\n219\n00:11:06.014 --> 00:11:07.980\nTalking about RoboCop, that's right.\n\n220\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.340\nSo Robocopy is in there, too.\n\n221\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.760\nAnd again, this just kind of goes\na little bit farther than Xcopy does.\n\n222\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.151\nYeah, it's like that.\n\n223\n00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:23.340\nTime stamps, scripting capabilities,\nscheduling capabilities.\n\n224\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.020\nBeing able to say,\nI want to copy this at this time.\n\n225\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.830\nNot only do I wanna carry over ACLs,\nbut I wanna script this out.\n\n226\n00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.873\nAnd I want that script to\nrun their task scheduler but\n\n227\n00:11:35.873 --> 00:11:39.416\nI don't want it to copy the file\nuntil it hits a certain time.\n\n228\n00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:44.760\nSo Robust Copy command if you will.\n\n229\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.610\n&gt;&gt; You get really good at that and you\nare definitely tip of the iceberg when it\n\n230\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.630\ncomes to having a command\nover using a copy feature.\n\n231\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.640\nThat is very robust,\nfantastically, aptly put.\n\n232\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.970\nIt is a very robust copy.\n\n233\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.120\n&gt;&gt; And there's a reason I\nput those in that order.\n\n234\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.398\nSo to help you out for\nmemorization on the exam.\n\n235\n00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:05.130\nCopy basic,\nXcopy a little bit more extreme,\n\n236\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.952\nrobust copy like Dan said\npart man part machine.\n\n237\n00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:10.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; We're just\ntalking going above and beyond,\n\n238\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.050\nfuturistic if you will.\n\n239\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.240\n&gt;&gt; So remember them for the exam.\n\n240\n00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.460\nAgain, especially, it says job name.\n\n241\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.160\nJob file.\n\n242\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.220\nJ-O-B files and stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.310\nYou really have the ability.\n\n244\n00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.450\nThe other thing to is Xcopy can be\nused in scripting, but it does have\n\n245\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.120\na problem sometimes is that when it\nfinds an error it stops in the script.\n\n246\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.600\nRobocopy actually has a recovery\ntype functionality where it can keep\n\n247\n00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.790\ngoing as well.\n\n248\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.930\nDespite things like errors and\nthat's definitely good in scripting.\n\n249\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.680\nThat's one of the things that\nDan's kinda already mentioned.\n\n250\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.470\nI'm joking around but seriously joking.\n\n251\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.010\nThat inside of your scripts,\nif you're trying to automate things,\n\n252\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.740\nit is a nightmare when things stop and\nyou really can't kinda figure out why.\n\n253\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.170\nSo Robust copy is really,\nreally a really good program as well.\n\n254\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.180\nJust know what they are.\n\n255\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.820\nI don't know that they're\ngonna ask you other than maybe\n\n256\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.530\nshowing you something on the exam that\nshows you the command prompt itself.\n\n257\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.200\nAnd then you've got copy and\nthen a series of parameters after that and\n\n258\n00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.530\nthey're saying what is this\nprogram actually doing.\n\n259\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.710\nYou might need to know\nsomething like that.\n\n260\n00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.130\nAll right, so we've talked about,\n\n261\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.190\nin other episodes we talked about\nsomething known as the Task Manager.\n\n262\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.110\nThe Task Manager, remember that was a,\n\n263\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.860\noop, I'm gonna apparently launch\nsomething up here in the background.\n\n264\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n265\n00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.950\nwe haven't talked about that.\n\n266\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.640\nBut I talked a little bit about things\nlike Task Manager through the graphical\n\n267\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.490\nuser interface, and we mentioned\nthings like processes and stuff.\n\n268\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.270\nAnd you have different\nthings like services.\n\n269\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.100\nAnd the ability to,\nend the process if I want to.\n\n270\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.530\nWell, that's the graphical user interface.\n\n271\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.040\nI see this list, is there a way that we\ncan actually list those processes and\n\n272\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.920\nservices here inside of the command\nprompt and the answer is, yes.\n\n273\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.280\nYou can do that, through a couple\nof one command known as tasklist.\n\n274\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.300\nAnd again, for your syntax purposes.\n\n275\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Tasklist, and I could do something.\n\n276\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.410\nI can actually run it by itself.\n\n277\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.370\nAgain, sometimes you can\nrun these by themselves and\n\n278\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.630\nthey like, okay,\nI know what you wanna do here.\n\n279\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.940\nYou can do that.\n\n280\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.825\nYou can also format the order too.\n\n281\n00:14:10.825 --> 00:14:15.655\nSo if you want real quick, we'll just do\ntask and we'll do list, space, forward,\n\n282\n00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:16.965\nslash, question mark.\n\n283\n00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:20.256\nMake sure I didn't get too many spaces in\nthere, sometimes it doesn't like that.\n\n284\n00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:23.190\nAnd you can see there\nare a ton of options here.\n\n285\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.870\nDefinitely check that out.\n\n286\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.730\nI'm not gonna bore you,\nladies and gentleman out there,\n\n287\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.950\nwith some of the individual details.\n\n288\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.190\nBut I'll kinda give you some examples.\n\n289\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.730\nSo maybe I wanna format in a table,\nso I can do something like this,\n\n290\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:39.820\nwhere I do tasklist /fo,\nfor format, and I do table.\n\n291\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.483\nSometimes it'll pipe these out,\nin a table like this,\n\n292\n00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:44.760\nwhere you get a little\nbit better information.\n\n293\n00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.254\nSometimes I've seen it\ndoes absolutely nothing.\n\n294\n00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:48.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is like hey,\n\n295\n00:14:48.923 --> 00:14:50.460\nit already is in its native format.\n\n296\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.260\nBut that's always nice to have.\n\n297\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.400\nIf I'm looking for a service, maybe\nI'm looking for service specifically.\n\n298\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.360\nOne of the things that I can do and I'm\ngonna show you why I might be looking for\n\n299\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.540\na service in something known\nas its process identifier.\n\n300\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.809\nProcess identifier, PID if you will,\n\n301\n00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:11.161\nthat lets me know not only the service\nthat's running it but its instance.\n\n302\n00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:15.783\nBecause there are time when you have\na service that is running multiple\n\n303\n00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.990\nindividual instances of a process.\n\n304\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.120\nAnd I know that might sound a little bit\nconfusing, but sometimes it happens.\n\n305\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.780\nsvchost is one that you always see.\n\n306\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.640\nThere's like seven of\nthem in Task Manager and\n\n307\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.300\nyou gotta kinda figure out which\none belongs to what service.\n\n308\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.480\nWell, here's something that you can do.\n\n309\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.710\nYou can run a tasklist, space, and\nyou can run /svc, for service.\n\n310\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.550\nAnd when you run this,\nyou can find the process identifiers.\n\n311\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.575\nThat are specific to services.\n\n312\n00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:44.563\nNow why am I wanna do something like that?\n\n313\n00:15:44.563 --> 00:15:49.276\nWhy am I want to find what the process\nthat there and there you go,\n\n314\n00:15:49.276 --> 00:15:51.646\nlook at that all those svc host.\n\n315\n00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:56.275\nIf you're looking at a service manager\nhost, if you're looking at like for\n\n316\n00:15:56.275 --> 00:15:57.587\ninstance My gosh.\n\n317\n00:15:57.587 --> 00:16:01.470\nI've got all these SVC hosts and\nI have no clue what's running them.\n\n318\n00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.470\nWell now, I can see the services\nassociated and their identifiers.\n\n319\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.639\nBut here's the one that I love to pick on,\nbecause this one's,\n\n320\n00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.589\nI know not something that is critical.\n\n321\n00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:11.652\n&gt;&gt; Mission critical, yeah.\n\n322\n00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:12.560\n&gt;&gt; To functionality, right?\n\n323\n00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.370\nAnd Dan already knows it.\n\n324\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.400\nHe can see it right there in the list,\nthe spooler, right?\n\n325\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.510\nSo let's pick on friend, spooler,\nmaybe I wanna be able to stop that.\n\n326\n00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.930\nWell, how do I stop that?\n\n327\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.706\nWell, one of the things I want you\nto understand is that if you will do\n\n328\n00:16:23.706 --> 00:16:27.218\nsomething like, for instance,\ninside of your Task Manager,\n\n329\n00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:31.790\nif I find one of these services, right,\nI can just sit there, and I could find it,\n\n330\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.806\nand I could turn around, and\nI could hit End process.\n\n331\n00:16:34.806 --> 00:16:39.470\nWell, I don't have the End process\ninside of the command prompt.\n\n332\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.940\nSo I can run something like taskkill.\n\n333\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.720\nNow, here's a big exam alert.\n\n334\n00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.640\nRemember one of the things that we started\nout our command line section here or\n\n335\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.970\ncommand prompt section with.\n\n336\n00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.721\nI'm gonna do a taskkill, all right?\n\n337\n00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.475\nAnd when I do a task kill,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n338\n00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:59.440\nwe will do our space forward\nslash question mark.\n\n339\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.597\nAll right, just kinda give you\nsome of the information here.\n\n340\n00:17:03.597 --> 00:17:06.102\nBut notice I have this process identifier,\nand\n\n341\n00:17:06.102 --> 00:17:09.840\nmaybe I wanna do it in process,\nlike I would do in task manager.\n\n342\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:16.630\nWell, I can run it taskkill, and I'm gonna\nset myself up for failure, and I'm doing\n\n343\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.820\nthis right away to let you you know, hey\nI already know this is going to happen.\n\n344\n00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.132\nBut I do a taskkill /PID for\nthe process identifier and,\n\n345\n00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:28.032\nlet me scroll back up here and make sure\nit was 1284, I think that's what it was.\n\n346\n00:17:28.032 --> 00:17:34.640\nYeah, 1284 right there, all right, and\nI do a 1284, right., and I run that.\n\n347\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.040\nNow, I don't have to worry about\nwhat the service is called,\n\n348\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.944\nI've got its specific identifier and\nI run it.\n\n349\n00:17:38.944 --> 00:17:43.570\nUh-oh, well, wait, why didn't it work?\n\n350\n00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.647\n&gt;&gt; I think I may know the reason why.\n\n351\n00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.300\n&gt;&gt; Dan help us out.\n\n352\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't see,\nare you running an administrative prompt?\n\n353\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.280\n&gt;&gt; So that's what's missing, right.\n\n354\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.250\nI'm not running an administrative\ncommand prompt.\n\n355\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.420\nSo one of the things that I have to\ndo is I have to jump down here, and\n\n356\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.120\nwe'll do our cmd here in the start menu or\nstart screen.\n\n357\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.890\nAnd I'm gonna do my\nlittle keyboard shortcut,\n\n358\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.635\ncuz if I can keep my hands off\nthe mouse as much as possible.\n\n359\n00:18:06.635 --> 00:18:07.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't like rodents.\n\n360\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.650\n[LAUGH] I'll do a control + shift + enter,\nand\n\n361\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.900\nthat gives me the ability to elevate\nit to an administrative command prompt.\n\n362\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.289\nAnd we can get right in there and\nrun it, here, okay?\n\n363\n00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:22.442\nSo now, if I do a task kill, and you know\nwhat, let's do this one more time, right.\n\n364\n00:18:22.442 --> 00:18:28.452\nLet's do a tasklist /svc,\nand we'll run this,\n\n365\n00:18:28.452 --> 00:18:34.045\nand I'm just gonna look for, again, right.\n\n366\n00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:39.190\nSpoolsv, again, the Spooler service is\nwhat that is and I'm looking for 1284.\n\n367\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.950\nBut this time now,\nwhat we'll do is we'll go ahead, and\n\n368\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.010\nwe'll do our CLS to clear our screen.\n\n369\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.255\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nrun a task [LAUGH] if I could spell it,\n\n370\n00:18:49.255 --> 00:18:56.370\nwe're gonna run a taskkill /PID 1284 And\nyou know what?\n\n371\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.310\nI wish I could say I did that on purpose,\nI keep forgetting this option here,\n\n372\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.500\nbecause it is a system service you\nknow what it's not gonna to let me do?\n\n373\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.340\nTerminate it, right?\n\n374\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.640\nSo you have to put a force in there,\nright?\n\n375\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.160\nIs essentially if we run this again,\nI gotta run the force option.\n\n376\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.338\nThat's what the F option is there,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n377\n00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:19.020\nIn fact, let me just confirm\nthat that's what they call it.\n\n378\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.310\nI'm pretty sure,\nI'm actually 99.9% sure, but\n\n379\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.720\nI'm pretty sure F is the,\nthat is not how you spell taskkill.\n\n380\n00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.850\nAgain syntax, syntax, syntax.\n\n381\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.050\nI'm pretty sure the F is\nforcefully terminates the process.\n\n382\n00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.340\nAnd that has to happen again,\nbecause it is a system process.\n\n383\n00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.165\nSo let's go ahead we rerun that,\nwe spell it right and put /F.\n\n384\n00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:46.733\nAll right, now, the process again,\nhas been terminated.\n\n385\n00:19:46.733 --> 00:19:47.588\nAll right, now,\n\n386\n00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:51.014\nthat's one of the things that you can\ndo inside of your command prompt.\n\n387\n00:19:51.014 --> 00:19:55.193\nAgain, keep in mind that\nyou can stop processes,\n\n388\n00:19:55.193 --> 00:20:01.640\nyou can stop these services, or\nprocesses if you will with taskkill.\n\n389\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.170\nNow, that's a service that's running,\nall right, and\n\n390\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.350\nlet me just double check, I don't see\nthis in my list, but I'm gonna go ahead\n\n391\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.570\njust like we have mentioned before it's\nnot always about just what's on the exam.\n\n392\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.405\nLet me show you how you can start,\nand restop that service.\n\n393\n00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:15.730\nYou probably seen it earlier,\n\n394\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.190\nwhen we tried to do it,\nwhen we first started here.\n\n395\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:26.006\nI'm gonna do a net stop spooler,\nand that's gonna stop the services.\n\n396\n00:20:26.006 --> 00:20:26.570\nAnd you know why it isn't.\n\n397\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.323\n&gt;&gt; It's not started.\n\n398\n00:20:27.323 --> 00:20:28.912\n&gt;&gt; It isn't started, right?\n\n399\n00:20:28.912 --> 00:20:30.628\nBut we could also\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n400\n00:20:30.628 --> 00:20:31.370\n&gt;&gt; I killed it.\n\n401\n00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I killed it dead.\n\n402\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.280\n&gt;&gt; Be gone.\n\n403\n00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Dead in it's\n&gt;&gt; Be gone.\n\n404\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.269\nDead in it's face, right?\nSo run.\n\n405\n00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:38.163\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanna start it back up,\n\n406\n00:20:38.163 --> 00:20:40.164\nif you're rebooting the service,\n\n407\n00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:44.033\nyou can do exactly what you see here\nnet space stop space spooler, but\n\n408\n00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:47.728\nthen you can just turn around run\na net space start space spooler.\n\n409\n00:20:50.943 --> 00:20:55.460\nAnd now, [LAUGH] it did it automatically\nagain, this is Windows protecting itself.\n\n410\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.470\nSo you could see that it's\nactually already running.\n\n411\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.230\nSo let me go ahead,\n\n412\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.130\nI'm gonna try to do that one more time,\njust to see if it'll play nice.\n\n413\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.420\nThere we go.\n\n414\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.730\nThe reason I'm doing this is,\ncuz I've done stuff that, like we've said,\n\n415\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.480\nyou gotta be careful, and\nI've messed around with system files.\n\n416\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.760\nAnd just because this service is started\nautomatically, I wanna make sure.\n\n417\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.690\nSo I stopped it and\nbasically, rebooting it,\n\n418\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.370\nand then we'll rerun the start and\nhopefully, it'll start back up.\n\n419\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.550\nAll right, now, if we wanted to check\nthat through our GUI we could always\n\n420\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.790\njump down back to our graphical\nuser interface or we could do our,\n\n421\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.840\nwe could run our tasklist again.\n\n422\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.720\nAgain, we could also type services.msc\nhere inside of the command prompt.\n\n423\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.700\nI'll push the name column here,\nheader at the top, type the letter P,\n\n424\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.194\nand I could see spooler, and\nit started, and it is running now.\n\n425\n00:21:49.194 --> 00:21:53.938\nSo couple of different things that you\ncan see kinda real world if you will,\n\n426\n00:21:53.938 --> 00:22:00.155\ninside of your command prompt relative to\nstarting and stopping different tasks.\n\n427\n00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:02.714\nAll right, now, we got a couple of\nother ones that we wanna look at.\n\n428\n00:22:02.714 --> 00:22:08.145\nI'm gonna go ahead, I'll save,\nshut down for last for obvious reasons.\n\n429\n00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:11.183\n[LAUGH] If I shut down the operating\nsystem here, we're gonna end the show.\n\n430\n00:22:11.183 --> 00:22:11.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n431\n00:22:11.838 --> 00:22:13.888\nwe'll go ahead and we'll keep that one.\n\n432\n00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:15.790\nYou know what?\n\n433\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.520\nI'll tell you what, Dan,\nhere's something that we are gonna do.\n\n434\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.080\nLet me go ahead, I am gonna shut down for\nthe purposes of moving into bootrec, so\n\n435\n00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.480\nletting Dan here know, cuz I'm\nkinda going off the beaten path and\n\n436\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.690\nsometimes when we do this,\nI fall flat on my face, so hopefully,\n\n437\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:30.920\nthat doesn't happen on camera here.\n\n438\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.366\nSo let's go ahead and\ngo back to the screen here real quick.\n\n439\n00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:38.110\nAnd inside of the command prompt,\nyou can shut down your machine, all right.\n\n440\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.636\nCouple different ways,\nI'm gonna actually do a restart.\n\n441\n00:22:40.636 --> 00:22:43.962\nWe're gonna do a shutdown_/force.\n\n442\n00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:46.963\nAnd the reason I do this is,\nbecause I don't want it to say,\n\n443\n00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:50.820\nI don't want all these pop-ups saying hey,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n444\n00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.140\nSomebody else is logged in the machine and\nwaiting for this process to stop.\n\n445\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.522\nI don't care about all that,\nand I'm gonna do a space /r for\n\n446\n00:22:57.522 --> 00:23:03.990\nthe restart option space /t for\ntime in seconds.\n\n447\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.391\nI'm gonna give it a 01 here, and\nwe'll go ahead and we will run it.\n\n448\n00:23:06.391 --> 00:23:10.610\nAnd it's gonna let me know that it's\ngonna stop and restart the machine.\n\n449\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.242\nNow, I'm doing this for a reason,\nbecause if I remember right,\n\n450\n00:23:14.242 --> 00:23:16.629\nI've got our, I've got our repair disk.\n\n451\n00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:23.100\nIs in the,\nit should be in the optical disk.\n\n452\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.818\nHere we're going to find out.\n\n453\n00:23:23.818 --> 00:23:24.653\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't look like it.\n\n454\n00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:27.918\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll find out here and\n\n455\n00:23:27.918 --> 00:23:31.743\nlet's see it doesn't look like it is.\n\n456\n00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:36.533\nLet's see, cuz there's another\none that I wanna show you called\n\n457\n00:23:36.533 --> 00:23:41.061\nBoot Recovery Utility, but\nwith the Boot Recovery Utility,\n\n458\n00:23:41.061 --> 00:23:45.877\nyou are required to have access,\nif you will to your repair disk.\n\n459\n00:23:45.877 --> 00:23:48.724\nOr in this case you have\nto have your boot media So\n\n460\n00:23:48.724 --> 00:23:52.510\nlet me go ahead and\nI'm gonna actually shut this machine down.\n\n461\n00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:56.280\nLet's check, we'll go ahead and\nkeep the cameras rolling here so\n\n462\n00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.580\nyou guys can kinda see what's going on.\n\n463\n00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.990\nI'm gonna shut this machine down.\n\n464\n00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.070\nWe will make sure that that disk is in.\n\n465\n00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.330\nAnd what we're gonna do\nessentially is we're gonna boot\n\n466\n00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:10.030\nto the Optical Media, and\nthat is important, right?\n\n467\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.430\nWhen we boot to the Optical Media,\nwhy are we doing that?\n\n468\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.760\nWell, this next utility is\nactually in the Command Prompt and\n\n469\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.330\ninside the Command Prompt\nyou have to get to this one.\n\n470\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.490\nAnd try that again here one more time and\nwe will get into the one-time Boot Menu.\n\n471\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.910\nThree times is the charm here.\n\n472\n00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:30.490\nTry this again, there we go.\n\n473\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.310\nSo what I'm doing here in rebooting the\nmachine with the shutdown option there is\n\n474\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.960\nwe need to, for our next command we\nactually find that in a repair disk.\n\n475\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.420\nAll right you can see that just\ntemporarily there that it said,\n\n476\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.640\nboot to the CD or DVD.\n\n477\n00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.560\nSo, what we're actually doing is we're\nlaunching up Windows Repair Disk.\n\n478\n00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.970\nIt's called WinRE.\n\n479\n00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.390\nWindows Recovery Environment.\n\n480\n00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.290\nNow, there's a couple of different\nways that you can find this.\n\n481\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.860\nYou can make a Windows Repair Disk, and\nit puts RE on your own separate media.\n\n482\n00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.100\nOne of the great things\nis pretty much with every\n\n483\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.510\nWindows installation media,\nor installation ISO, and\n\n484\n00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:08.450\nwe'll talk about that ISO format and\nstuff when we get into our installation.\n\n485\n00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.070\nComes with the recovery environment\nalready basically pre-installed.\n\n486\n00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.650\nSo what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna go forward, and\n\n487\n00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.300\nmy head's kinda covering this up,\nyou'll see the next option here, right,\n\n488\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.140\nI do wanna kind of next through this, but\n\n489\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.652\ninstead of going through the install,\nnotice I have this Repair your computer,\n\n490\n00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:30.540\nand again, that's what's known as\nthe Windows Recovery Environment.\n\n491\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.780\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nboot into the recovery environment, and\n\n492\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.580\nit talks about using the system tools,\nif you will.\n\n493\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.290\nOr restore your computer\nusing a system image.\n\n494\n00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.240\nWe're gonna go ahead,\n\n495\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.290\nwe're gonna use the recovery tools\nthat can help me fix the computer.\n\n496\n00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.880\nAnd more importantly,\nwe wanna get the recovery tools,\n\n497\n00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.380\nessentially the command prompt here.\n\n498\n00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.490\nAnd it's telling me that's\nit unable to start here and\n\n499\n00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.240\nit might take just a second.\n\n500\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.080\nAnd it might take just a second, and\nit's gonna try to do this automatically.\n\n501\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.120\nOne of the great things here, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and cancel this system restore.\n\n502\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.110\nI actually don't want the system restore.\n\n503\n00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.228\nIt's gonna try to a, hopefully,\nhopefully it doesn't fix it, and\n\n504\n00:26:08.228 --> 00:26:10.450\nit allows me to boot into it.\n\n505\n00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:14.690\nSometimes they try to automate the process\nfor your average home user that's gonna be\n\n506\n00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:19.730\nperfectly fine if you can,\nif it can fix what it finds then so be it.\n\n507\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:20.560\nAnd other times,\n\n508\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.440\nyou have to go more into the advanced\ntools to be able to repair your computer.\n\n509\n00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.940\nAnd that's what I'm hoping\nI can get into now.\n\n510\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.420\nAgain, for the purposes of actually\nshowing you the Command Prompt\n\n511\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.880\nthat's in the Recovery Environment,\nthat leads me to that next command.\n\n512\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.770\nAnd that's called again,\nbottrec, B-O-T-T-R-E-C.\n\n513\n00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.960\nIt's short for boot recovery.\n\n514\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.610\nWhen you have a problem like you can see\nthere where it was telling me, hey launch\n\n515\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:50.520\nWindows automatically or you wanna repair\nit, you might have to use this command.\n\n516\n00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.430\nIn fact, I had to use it before.\n\n517\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.260\nThere's another one and\nthey don't mention it here but\n\n518\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.150\nI would just wanna briefly\nas it's trying to.\n\n519\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.470\nI wonder if I could just cancel it out,\nI might be able to.\n\n520\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.530\nNo, it can't be cancelled.\n\n521\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:03.729\nSo yeah, it's gonna make me stay here.\n\n522\n00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.270\nThere's another one that's also very,\nvery important,\n\n523\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.790\nwhen it comes to trying to fix boot\nproblems, inside of your operating system.\n\n524\n00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.880\nAnd that's something known as BCD edit, so\n\n525\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.710\nif you can get into the Command Prompt\nin the Recovery Environment.\n\n526\n00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.740\nSee, BCD is called\nthe Boot Configuration Data.\n\n527\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.990\nAnd it's what the Windows boot files,\nmore specifically,\n\n528\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.090\nsomething known as\nthe Windows Boot Manager, looks to\n\n529\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:33.130\nthat information to find out where on\nthe hard drive is the operating system?\n\n530\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.140\nWhat is the operating system\nthat I'm supposed to be booting?\n\n531\n00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.130\nSo it lets the boot manager\nknow that information.\n\n532\n00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.570\nWell, if that BCD, that\nBoot Configuration Data gets corrupted,\n\n533\n00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.690\nit can cause the machine to fail to boot.\n\n534\n00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.910\nThere are times when you might\nwanna edit the BCD, maybe for\n\n535\n00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.860\nthe purposes of doing a multi-boot.\n\n536\n00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.120\nAgain, I know multi-boot is becoming more\nof a thing in the past with virtualization\n\n537\n00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.930\nsoftware out there, but you could\nstill do it and you could need it.\n\n538\n00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.920\nBoot Recovery, again, is one of those\nones that we wanna try to get into.\n\n539\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.230\nWe wanna try to show you access, because\nyou can actually fix different things.\n\n540\n00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.246\nFor instance,\nyou can fix in boot recovery,\n\n541\n00:28:13.246 --> 00:28:15.750\nyou can fix the recovery partition.\n\n542\n00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.130\nOr not the recovery partition, the boot\nsector that holds the boot information.\n\n543\n00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:24.380\nYou can also repair the MBR to,\nthe master boot record.\n\n544\n00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.338\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and this might\ntake a second, so what we're gonna do,\n\n545\n00:28:28.338 --> 00:28:32.297\nis we'll go ahead and use the magic of TV,\nand we'll come back just as soon as this\n\n546\n00:28:32.297 --> 00:28:35.475\ngets done deciding whether it\ncan attempt an automatic repair.\n\n547\n00:28:35.475 --> 00:28:39.046\nAnd we'll show you the Command Prompt\nfrom the Recovery Environment.\n\n548\n00:28:39.046 --> 00:28:43.230\nAll right.\nSo it does look like it tried.\n\n549\n00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.530\nIt didn't find anything, which is kind\nof what I thought it was gonna do.\n\n550\n00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.950\nBut It could take awhile,\nin fact, it's kind of funny.\n\n551\n00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.330\nWe had Dan was joking, welcome to\nthe two or three or six hour wait here,\n\n552\n00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.140\nbecause sometimes it could take awhile.\n\n553\n00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.553\nWe're gonna use the view advanced\noptions for system recovery and\n\n554\n00:28:59.553 --> 00:29:01.775\nreport, or repair, excuse me.\n\n555\n00:29:01.775 --> 00:29:05.130\nAnd this is really what I wanted to get\ninto and I was hoping it would get there\n\n556\n00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.610\na little bit faster so, that's why we\nkinda had to use the magic of TV, here.\n\n557\n00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.940\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna launch the Command Prompt.\n\n558\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.730\nAnd I do apologize ahead of time, first of\nall, for these mattes, this matted screen\n\n559\n00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.870\nyou see here, and the fact that the\nCommand Prompt isn't adjusted before hand,\n\n560\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.940\nand we're kinda having\nto do this on the fly.\n\n561\n00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.580\nKeep in mind, we aren't using\nthe video card driver, at all.\n\n562\n00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.339\nRemember that this is like\na pre-installation environment.\n\n563\n00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.480\nSo you get a very, very low resolution.\n\n564\n00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.910\nSo again, like I said,\nI gotta apologize ahead of time.\n\n565\n00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.220\nNow, I want you to notice that inside of\nthe Recovery Environment we have a command\n\n566\n00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.840\ncalled bootrec.\n\n567\n00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.405\nAll right, and you can kinda see\nwhat it tells us that it does.\n\n568\n00:29:45.405 --> 00:29:46.230\nRight.\n\n569\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.520\nRemember I said it can fix the MBR?\n\n570\n00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.600\nAnd I also said that you could\nmodify the BCD with BCD Edit.\n\n571\n00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.280\nWell this is cool,\n\n572\n00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.570\nbecause if you have an MBR based system,\nyou could fix MBR right here.\n\n573\n00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:02.260\nOr if you have the necessity to\nrebuild the Boot Configuration data,\n\n574\n00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.750\nyou can also do that as well.\n\n575\n00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:10.720\nSo I could run something\nlike bootrec /fixmbr,\n\n576\n00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.580\nand that would fix the Master Boot Record.\n\n577\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.780\nOr how about the container that\nholds the Master Boot Record?\n\n578\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.090\nWell, that would be FixBoot, right,\n\n579\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:22.050\nI can write a new boot sector\ninto the system partition, right?\n\n580\n00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.280\nAnd we can go ahead and run this, and\n\n581\n00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.190\nnotice, after all of that wait,\nee didn't take that long, right?\n\n582\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:31.500\nAnd then this is where we could do\nour shutdown, and you know what?\n\n583\n00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.450\nI had think, if I remember right, I don't\nknow if shutdown actually works from this.\n\n584\n00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.320\nBecause believe it or not,\nshutdown is actually unexecutable,\n\n585\n00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.300\nthat runs from the system 32 folder,\nso we're gonna,\n\n586\n00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.410\nwe're gonna see here if I could\nactually do, a shutdown, or a restart.\n\n587\n00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.340\nI think what you're gonna find is that\nI can not, yeah, that's what I thought.\n\n588\n00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.630\nSo, let me see if I can remember.\n\n589\n00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.150\nThis is Dir, we're gonna go ahead,\nand what are we gonna do?\n\n590\n00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.280\nWe'll do a, if I remember right, it's I?\n\n591\n00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.930\nNo, it's not I.\n\n592\n00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.310\nE?\n\n593\n00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.530\nThere we go.\n\n594\n00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.470\nIf I remember right, cuz your letters\nare a little bit different here when you\n\n595\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.730\nare in the Recovery Environment.\n\n596\n00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.737\nAnd there is nothing in E,\nso that is not it.\n\n597\n00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:17.450\nI tell you what, let's do diskpart.\n\n598\n00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.970\nAnd we're gonna look\nat diskpart coming up.\n\n599\n00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.740\nList disks, and then list.\n\n600\n00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.104\nActually, we'll go ahead and\n\n601\n00:31:25.104 --> 00:31:28.473\ndo, [LAUGH] hey, unscripted, we'll do\na little bit of this [INAUDIBLE] now.\n\n602\n00:31:28.473 --> 00:31:30.330\n[LAUGH] List vol,\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n603\n00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.879\nSo I'm actually looking, it's called D.\n\n604\n00:31:31.879 --> 00:31:35.040\nSo we're gonna get into.\n\n605\n00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.230\nI guess they do, let's get into D,\nactually, what are we doing here?\n\n606\n00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.450\nWe'll exit out of this,\nwe'll do D:, do a dir, there we go.\n\n607\n00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.590\nSo I'm gonna show you actually how\nyou could run shutdown from inside of\n\n608\n00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.690\nthe Recovery Environment, when you\ndon't actually have that application.\n\n609\n00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:58.160\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna do a cd space,\n\n610\n00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.680\nwe'll do d:\\windows\\system32, we'll get\ninto system 32, and if I remember right,\n\n611\n00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.810\nwe should be able to do a shutdown,\nfor shutdown r, for shut down 01.\n\n612\n00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.109\nAnd wait for it.\n\n613\n00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:15.945\nAnd hopefully it will restart the machine.\n\n614\n00:32:15.945 --> 00:32:18.995\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, would you also have been\nable to just give it the full path\n\n615\n00:32:18.995 --> 00:32:20.395\ninstead of changing it in the directory?\n\n616\n00:32:20.395 --> 00:32:20.895\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you could.\n\n617\n00:32:20.895 --> 00:32:21.755\n&gt;&gt; Just to let you out.\n\n618\n00:32:21.755 --> 00:32:23.255\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n619\n00:32:23.255 --> 00:32:25.325\nLet me kind of expand\non what Dan mentioned.\n\n620\n00:32:25.325 --> 00:32:26.085\nThat's exactly it.\n\n621\n00:32:26.085 --> 00:32:29.270\nRun shutdown, type the location\nof the executable, it'll say,\n\n622\n00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:34.010\nwe're not running it from here,\nyou need to run it from that location.\n\n623\n00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.530\nAnd you could see, basically it took\nus out of the recovery environment, and\n\n624\n00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.010\nnow we can log back into the machine.\n\n625\n00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:43.030\nNow, I'm gonna talk a little bit more\nabout this part because it is on the exam.\n\n626\n00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:47.170\nWe didn't really do justice there, but\nI can show you in a real world example\n\n627\n00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.650\nwhere I might need to use this part to\nfigure out which volumes are where.\n\n628\n00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.500\nSo I know that we've kind of gone\na little bit over on this one, Dan.\n\n629\n00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.420\nSo it does look like we'll have\nto do a small part three here\n\n630\n00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.420\nto kinda get the rest of\nthe shoelaces tied if you will.\n\n631\n00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, no problemo there my man.\n\n632\n00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.880\nIt's a lot of fun, we've been having\na good time doing this so far.\n\n633\n00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.190\nHopefully you have as well.\n\n634\n00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.520\nAnd you'll join us for that part three,\nthe culmination of our\n\n635\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.500\nlovely command line tools that we\nare going to be using as technicians.\n\n636\n00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.090\nBut as Wes said, looking at the clock.\n\n637\n00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.370\nWe are out of time for this episode.\n\n638\n00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.200\nSo time for us to sign off.\n\n639\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.580\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n640\n00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n641\n00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.323\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n642\n00:33:23.323 --> 00:33:30.461\n[MUSIC]\n\n643\n00:33:30.461 --> 00:33:32.600\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV\n\n",

00:00:10.540\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.565\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\nwelcome back to yet\n\n5\n00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.475\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.342\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\ntoday's episode, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.890\nit's all about our A+ series,\nworking our way through that.\n\n8\n00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.367\nSpecifically looking at Windows\ncommand line tools or command prompt,\n\n9\n00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.140\ntools inside of the command prompt.\n\n10\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.030\nIt's been a lot of fun so far.\n\n11\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.835\nWes has shown us a lot of\nreally cool stuff, and\n\n12\n00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:33.606\nI'm kinda giving away who's with me today.\n\n13\n00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:36.780\nYes, you know who it is,\nit's our good friend Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.010\nWes, how's it going, man?\n\n15\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.863\n&gt;&gt; It's great, man.\n\n16\n00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:40.628\nI thought you were going to be like, yeah,\n\n17\n00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:43.339\ntoday we've got the President of\nthe United States here with us.\n\n18\n00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.263\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; Mr Trump.\n\n19\n00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:45.364\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How are we doing now?\n\n20\n00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, everything but\nthe bank account, that's right.\n\n21\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.700\nGreat to see everybody out\nthere in electrical limbo.\n\n22\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.230\nThat is right, we are moving along,\nwell like Dan said, in command prompt.\n\n23\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.550\n&gt;&gt; We did have a few additional commands\nthat we kind of wanted to wrap up here.\n\n24\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.240\nWe been talking about a bunch of them.\n\n25\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.830\nI will let you know that this one might be\na little bit shorter than the first couple\n\n26\n00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.700\nof them, just because, well we couldn't\nreally fit them all in the last episode.\n\n27\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.870\nAnd we certainly didn't wanna go so\n\n28\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.720\nlong that we started losing\nyour attention out there.\n\n29\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.560\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive in, and\n\n30\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.660\nwe'll pick up where we left off.\n\n31\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.770\nKeep in mind the last episode we\ntalked about the boot wreck utility,\n\n32\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.860\nboot recovery utility.\n\n33\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.690\nYou know it's a way to fix things\nlike your master boot record,\n\n34\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.570\nif a master boot record gets\ncorrupted you can rebuild it.\n\n35\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.605\nIf the boot sector within\nthe machine needs to be rebuilt and\n\n36\n00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.645\nmade compatible with Windows 7,\nyou can do a fix boot as well.\n\n37\n00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.375\nAs well as even rebuilding the boot\nconfiguration data, right?\n\n38\n00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:42.173\nWe talked just briefly about the BCD, that\nbasically shows the Windows Boot Manager\n\n39\n00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:44.376\nwhen it goes to bootstrap\nthe operating system.\n\n40\n00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.905\nHey, where do I find the operating system?\n\n41\n00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:48.165\nWhich is the operating system to load?\n\n42\n00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:50.395\nWhat partician do I look at?\n\n43\n00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:54.350\nAnd this is really the BCD's\nbeen around since Windows Vista.\n\n44\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.440\nIt replaced the earlier boot.ini\nfile that Windows XP would look,\n\n45\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.240\ntext based file that would\ncontain all that information.\n\n46\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.430\nSo if you're not familiar with those,\ndefinitely go back and check those out.\n\n47\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.760\nAnd we're gonna kinda move along\nwithin our command list here.\n\n48\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.400\nAnd there's a couple of different\ncommands that I've kinda lumped together.\n\n49\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.770\nKinda like I did in the first part where\nwe talked about the copy command copy and\n\n50\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.020\nrobo copy.\n\n51\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.896\nThis is another one that I'd like\nto put these two kind of together,\n\n52\n00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:21.233\nbecause it helps us to manage our storage\ndevices that our within our systems.\n\n53\n00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:24.090\nAnd one of them's called DiskPart and\nthe other one's called format.\n\n54\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.460\nNow disc part, when I was in the recovery\nenvironment, you can actually see\n\n55\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.030\na real world application of why\nyou might actually use DiskPart.\n\n56\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.490\nBecause when you're in that recovery\nenvironment, your drive letter,\n\n57\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.320\nyour volume letters.\n\n58\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.170\nThey get all messed up because\none of those volume letters,\n\n59\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.150\nis actually a RAM disk, if you will.\n\n60\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.540\nWell you used to use RAM disks in\nthe earlier days of Windows, right?\n\n61\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.160\nYou would basically quarantine\na portion of the memory off.\n\n62\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.040\nAnd you'd use that kinda\nlike a hard drive.\n\n63\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.960\nWell it kinda messes with the letter.\n\n64\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.851\nSo if I need to figure which volume\nis the system volume, right?\n\n65\n00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:56.970\nSo you're gonna use DiskPart to do that.\n\n66\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.170\nHowever you can also use disk\nbars very powerful utility.\n\n67\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.347\nWe've shown you in other episodes, the GUI\ntype storage management technology,\n\n68\n00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:06.088\ncalled disk management, right?\n\n69\n00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:10.306\nWhere we were managing in our partitions,\nwe were creating, deleting partitions, we\n\n70\n00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:14.477\nwere extending volumes, shrinking volumes,\nif you will, changing drive letters.\n\n71\n00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:14.989\nGuess what?\n\n72\n00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.370\nYou also have the ability to do this\ninside of the command prompt as well.\n\n73\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.580\nAnd it's not only good to do this\nduring an online operating system, but\n\n74\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.066\neven when there's a system like we showed\nyou in the last part here where maybe\n\n75\n00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:30.159\nyou are in a recovery environment.\n\n76\n00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.750\nAnd you gotta kinda figure\nout what's going on.\n\n77\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.220\nMaybe even make some changes, maybe even\nprepare some drives, you can do that.\n\n78\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.579\nSo I definitely want you\nto be aware of disk part.\n\n79\n00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.160\nIn fact, let's go ahead and dive right\nback into the command prompt here.\n\n80\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.700\nUnderstand that DiskPart\nis its own utility.\n\n81\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.450\nAnd I say that because when I type\nDiskPart you're gonna notice that\n\n82\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.840\nsomething happens that's a little\nbit different than the other\n\n83\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.880\ncommands that we've run.\n\n84\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.833\nFirst of all you'll notice\nthat the UAC triggers so\n\n85\n00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:05.275\nyou can see that this is a more\nof an administrative effort.\n\n86\n00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:10.174\nNow one of the things I didn't use is\nan administrative command prompt and\n\n87\n00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:13.580\nthat's why it's moved it\nout of my standard user.\n\n88\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.860\nMy standard user doesn't have\nthe privileges to run this application.\n\n89\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.207\nNow, that isn't consistent across\nthe board and let me show you why.\n\n90\n00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:25.044\nBecause if I was to, let's say,\nwe'll type cmd in here, and\n\n91\n00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:28.960\nwe'll elevate our command prompt, right?\n\n92\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.440\nIf I type diskpart here,\n\n93\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.010\nyou'll notice that it runs right\nwithin the command personal.\n\n94\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.200\nAnd personally,\n[LAUGH] I like this a little bit better,\n\n95\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.640\njust cuz I don't have to resize all\nthe fonts and everything right there.\n\n96\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.360\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.300\nI'm gonna run it right from inside of\nour administrative command prompt.\n\n98\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.850\n&gt;&gt; Now one of the things I like about\nthis part is if you make any errors or\n\n99\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.870\nyou don't type anything well let's\njust say if you make an error.\n\n100\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.920\nIt instantly throws you\nto your help menu and\n\n101\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.150\nsays hey this is really what\nyou should be doing right?\n\n102\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.180\nI don't have to run a question mark.\n\n103\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.645\nI can,\nI could also type help if I wanted to.\n\n104\n00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:06.525\n&gt;&gt; I feel like it's being sarcastic to us.\n\n105\n00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:08.170\n&gt;&gt; I really think, yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.570\n&gt;&gt; You put the wrong thing in and then\nit's like hey bud, did you mean one of\n\n107\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.600\nthese commands and not that stupid\ncrap you put in just a second ago?\n\n108\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.303\n&gt;&gt; Step away from your computer.\n\n109\n00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:17.790\n[LAUGH] That's right he's going\nNick Barnes on us, right,\n\n110\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.750\nstep away from the computer.\n\n111\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.980\nYou don't know what you're doing, so the\ngood thing is, anytime you [LAUGH] make\n\n112\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.450\nan error in this you're gonna know it\ncuz you'll see this screen right here.\n\n113\n00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.540\nNow one of the things that this doesn't\nhave, so you'll have to bear with me,\n\n114\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.430\nis the ability to clear the screen.\n\n115\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.490\nAnd that's why you'll see me kinda\nmoving things off of the screen here.\n\n116\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.677\nIt's just, people that have\nworked in the command lines,\n\n117\n00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:44.075\nit's one of the ways they kinda keep them\ntrack of where they are within the command\n\n118\n00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:47.535\nline interpreter itself so\nyou don't actually have to do this.\n\n119\n00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:52.260\nSo let me talk about some of the things\nthat you can do with this command.\n\n120\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.421\nSo for instance, if I want to know what\nthe hard drives are within the system I\n\n121\n00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:59.411\ncould type, list space and\ndisk, and when I run this,\n\n122\n00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:01.839\nit shows me the disks\nthat are in the system.\n\n123\n00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.383\nAnd to kinda give you a comparison of\nwhat we might be seeing cuz I mentioned\n\n124\n00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:06.960\ndisk management.\n\n125\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.220\nLet me go ahead and I'll just fire up disk\nmanagement here and I want you to see.\n\n126\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.003\nNotice Disk 0, Disk 1, Disk 2, and\nif I go over here I have Disk 0, 1, and\n\n127\n00:06:16.003 --> 00:06:17.390\n2 right here as well.\n\n128\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.210\nSo and\n\n129\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.410\nit's kinda the graphical user interface\nversus what we see in the command prompt.\n\n130\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.840\nSo, we'll stay in the command prompt here,\nbut I just wanted to show you that.\n\n131\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.280\nNow, keep in mind, you wanna be very,\nvery careful with this command.\n\n132\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.730\nDan made a good comment in\nthe very first part that we did.\n\n133\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.180\nYou don't wanna run your\nstuff in elevated privileges.\n\n134\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.798\nWhy?\n\n135\n00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:41.150\nBecause you could inadvertently\ndamage your operating system, right?\n\n136\n00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.510\nWell, notice what I do\nto run this utility.\n\n137\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.955\nI have to be elevated, so\nthat means that if I run this incorrectly.\n\n138\n00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:54.375\nRight maybe my syntax is right but my\nerror is a little bit different and I can\n\n139\n00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:58.195\nmake modifications to hard drives here\nthat you really don't wanna make right?\n\n140\n00:06:58.195 --> 00:07:02.105\nSo one of the things that you can do after\nyou list whatever the disk is that you\n\n141\n00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:06.695\nwanna work with,\nyou can also do a select all right?\n\n142\n00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:11.992\nSo select disk,\nin this case let's say, disk 1.\n\n143\n00:07:11.992 --> 00:07:16.747\nWell, it tells me that disk 1 is selected,\nbut I don't trust myself ever and\n\n144\n00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:20.112\nespecially when it comes to typing,\nand you ladies and\n\n145\n00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:22.110\ngents out there should see why.\n\n146\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.675\nSo I turn around, and\nI do a list disk again.\n\n147\n00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:28.128\nAnd notice this little asterisk\nsymbol that's right here,\n\n148\n00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:30.091\nit lets me know visually that yes,\n\n149\n00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:35.005\nyou have selected whatever the disk is\nthat the asterisk symbol is next to.\n\n150\n00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:37.085\nAll right so that's one of\nthe things that you can do too.\n\n151\n00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:40.671\nYou can also do list volume right and\nif you list the volume,\n\n152\n00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:45.790\nany volumes that you've created whether\nthey have an assigned drive letter or not.\n\n153\n00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.920\nThis system reserved one, by the way,\nit doesn't have a drive letter,\n\n154\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.440\nbecause it's a protected volume, right?\n\n155\n00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.268\nThis is where your boot files and stuff\nare staying so That's why it doesn't have\n\n156\n00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:01.530\na drive letter, but you can see for\ninstance, I have letter D, right?\n\n157\n00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.368\nAnd I can see this label here, kind of\ntells me without even looking at the type,\n\n158\n00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:07.428\nI can tell that it is\nsome kind of DVD-ROM,\n\n159\n00:08:07.428 --> 00:08:09.574\ncuz it's using the universal disk format.\n\n160\n00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:12.205\nAnd that's specific to optical drives.\n\n161\n00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:15.615\nIf you're not aware of that, bump up\nover to our 901 exam, where Dan and\n\n162\n00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:19.405\nI talked about all the different hard\ndrives and storage technologies, right?\n\n163\n00:08:19.405 --> 00:08:23.405\nBut it does tell me type is a DVD-ROM and\nI can see the size, see the health,\n\n164\n00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:25.910\nand I can see the info behind it, right?\n\n165\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.490\nI could also see the system\npartition in this case.\n\n166\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.720\nI can see volume 2 is our C drive, right?\n\n167\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.820\nSo if I wanted to make modifications to\nlocal disk C, I would select this volume.\n\n168\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.300\nNow, how would I select the volume?\n\n169\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.355\nWell, just like selecting a disk.\n\n170\n00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:48.871\nYou can also do select volume, and\nin this case I can do volume 2.\n\n171\n00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:53.920\nAnd again, I never trust myself, I always\ngo back and say, list volume again.\n\n172\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.630\nAnd wash, rinse,\n\n173\n00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.540\nrepeat, we have the little asterisk symbol\nthat is right there ready to go for us.\n\n174\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.420\nNow be careful in doing this, right?\n\n175\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.600\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nlist the disks two, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.190\nBecause notice what happened,\noriginally I selected disk 1.\n\n177\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.455\nYou remember that there, Dan?\n\n178\n00:09:11.455 --> 00:09:14.869\nAnd when I selected volume 2,\nnotice what did.\n\n179\n00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:19.895\nIt bumped me right over to disk 0,\nthat's because, guess what?\n\n180\n00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:22.331\nVolume 2 is an on disk 1.\n\n181\n00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:26.846\nAnd this is one of the reasons I always\ntell you to constantly do the list,\n\n182\n00:09:26.846 --> 00:09:31.003\nbecause there might be a point in\nwhich you do something like this.\n\n183\n00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:35.098\nYou're way down in to the command\nprompt and you completely forget,\n\n184\n00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:37.568\nyou know what, I selected that volume and\n\n185\n00:09:37.568 --> 00:09:41.678\nI now I just maybe made a modification\nto a hard drive within a system.\n\n186\n00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:42.766\nLike a racing.\n\n187\n00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:44.811\n[LAUGH] All right, so that would be bad.\n\n188\n00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:46.470\nIt's not something we want to do.\n\n189\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.761\nSo let me go ahead, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n190\n00:09:49.761 --> 00:09:53.770\nI'm gonna select disk 1, one more time.\n\n191\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.285\nYou gotta actually type select Wes,\nthat might help.\n\n192\n00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:59.935\nSelect disk 1, there we go.\n\n193\n00:09:59.935 --> 00:10:03.516\nAnd again kinda practicing\nwhat I preach here.\n\n194\n00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:07.645\nI wanna list the disks again, so I'm\nmaking sure that I do have it selected,\n\n195\n00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:08.299\nall right?\n\n196\n00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:11.829\nNow you can also do things like for\ninstance creating partitions, right?\n\n197\n00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:17.765\nAnd if on this I do list partition, I will\nsee if there are any partitions available.\n\n198\n00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:20.845\nThis is a fresh drive,\nwe don't have anything there, all right?\n\n199\n00:10:20.845 --> 00:10:23.449\nSo I can also do things\nlike creating partitions.\n\n200\n00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:27.984\nIn this case,\nI can do a create partition and\n\n201\n00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:31.549\nI could make it a primary, right?\n\n202\n00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:33.104\nSo create partition primary,\n\n203\n00:10:33.104 --> 00:10:36.943\nright, and that lets me know that it's\nsuccessfully created a partition.\n\n204\n00:10:36.943 --> 00:10:42.323\nNow if I run list partition,\nI see that I got a partition, right?\n\n205\n00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:45.572\nBut now all I've done is kind\nof logically divided it up,\n\n206\n00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:48.020\nI haven't really done anything, right?\n\n207\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.796\nSo once I do that, first thing that\nI have to do is I have to do a,\n\n208\n00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:56.050\nI could do a clean if I want, and\nthat would clean the disc, right?\n\n209\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.066\nThe next thing that I can do as well,\nis we could run the format command.\n\n210\n00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:02.784\nNow the format command runs\ninside of DiskPart, but\n\n211\n00:11:02.784 --> 00:11:06.940\nit also has its own separate command that\nruns, cuz they kinda run hand in hand.\n\n212\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.076\nSo I can do something like format and\nI could do FS equals, and\n\n213\n00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:12.871\nwe could do NTFS, right?\n\n214\n00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:16.357\nAnd I could say, maybe I wanna attach\na label to it, right, a drive label.\n\n215\n00:11:16.357 --> 00:11:18.675\nI could say this is demo and I do a quick,\n\n216\n00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:23.060\nI don't know what a quuck is, but\nI can do a quick and I can run that.\n\n217\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.820\nYou know what?\n\n218\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.600\nThere is no volume selected,\nplease select a volume again.\n\n219\n00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.540\nWhat did I forget?\n\n220\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.400\nYou know what it is?\n\n221\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:39.810\nYou have to mark a partition as active and\nI can't do anything, so let me do that.\n\n222\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.843\nSo I listed a partition.\n\n223\n00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:44.610\nRight?\n\n224\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.860\nAnd there are no partitions\non this disk to show.\n\n225\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.440\nYou know what?\n\n226\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.490\nLet's do list disk.\n\n227\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.318\nI probably am doing the same thing.\n\n228\n00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:55.577\nOkay.\n\n229\n00:11:55.577 --> 00:11:59.590\n[LAUGH] Do you remember the clean option?\n\n230\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n231\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.406\n&gt;&gt; You know what that does?\n\n232\n00:12:01.406 --> 00:12:02.780\n&gt;&gt; I assume it removes\nall of your partitions.\n\n233\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.713\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We just did some spring\n\n234\n00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:06.955\ncleaning here, so let's try that again.\n\n235\n00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:10.137\nAll right so, that's why I say,\nalways check, right?\n\n236\n00:12:10.137 --> 00:12:11.434\nSo we'll do this again, and\n\n237\n00:12:11.434 --> 00:12:14.958\nthis will give me a chance real quick to\nshow you that you can also abbreviate.\n\n238\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:21.905\nSo I could do a create, part, prime and\nI abbreviated that and it creates it.\n\n239\n00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:25.679\nSo there are certain things that\nyou can do, like list part,\n\n240\n00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:28.424\nshows me that it's the partition, right?\n\n241\n00:12:28.424 --> 00:12:36.377\nNow I believe if we re-run that\nformat command, there we go.\n\n242\n00:12:36.377 --> 00:12:40.830\nIt does when you have a partition to\napply file system to a partition.\n\n243\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.540\nYou can't apply a file system to\na partition that doesn't exist, right?\n\n244\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:50.770\nSo now if we do list part,\nI see that I have one, right?\n\n245\n00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.600\nAnd how about this?\n\n246\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.960\nLet's do a list vol.\n\n247\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.676\nRemember that one that we just created,\nI put the label on that said demo, right?\n\n248\n00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.157\nBut I don't have a letter.\n\n249\n00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:00.800\nI don't have a mounting point.\n\n250\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.973\nSo how do I do a mounting point?\n\n251\n00:13:02.973 --> 00:13:05.170\nWell you're gonna do your sel.\n\n252\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.680\nWe're gonna abbreviate,\nyou can abbreviate that too, select vol.\n\n253\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.781\nNow it's select, I just wanna\nshow you this abbreviation here.\n\n254\n00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.810\nSelect vol, and I'm gonna do a three.\n\n255\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.660\nNotice that it did take the abbreviation\nthere, and it was already selected but\n\n256\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.640\nI can also do list vol again.\n\n257\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.180\nAnd then I just do assign.\n\n258\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.990\nAnd we spell assign right.\n\n259\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.505\nAnd right now, I could do this or\nI could force it, right?\n\n260\n00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:28.430\nI do assign.\n\n261\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.550\nWhat it's gonna do automatically is it's\ngonna say, okay, I got the alphabet here.\n\n262\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.290\nWhat's the next sequential letter?\n\n263\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.263\nI already got D assigned.\n\n264\n00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:38.394\nSo my guess would be that if I just let\nit do its thing, it would assign it E.\n\n265\n00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:39.283\n&gt;&gt; Z?\n\n266\n00:13:39.283 --> 00:13:40.728\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very good, Dan.\n\n267\n00:13:40.728 --> 00:13:43.270\nPerfect with the alphabet there, right?\n\n268\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.860\nBut let's say maybe I do want to do that.\n\n269\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.752\nMaybe I say, you know what?\n\n270\n00:13:45.752 --> 00:13:47.851\nI wanna tell it what letter to assign.\n\n271\n00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:48.943\nWell, you can actually do that.\n\n272\n00:13:48.943 --> 00:13:53.682\nYou do letter equals Z, and in this case,\nif I turn around and do my list vol again,\n\n273\n00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:55.421\nwe did exactly that, right?\n\n274\n00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:59.221\nSo now we have one and\nwe had the eliminator, right, ZZ Top.\n\n275\n00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:03.046\n[LAUGH] So a couple of things\nthat you guys can do again,\n\n276\n00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:05.941\nkeep in mind inside a disk part, right?\n\n277\n00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:07.680\nYou can manage your volumes.\n\n278\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.250\nAnd let me go ahead and type exit here.\n\n279\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.240\nExits out of the system.\n\n280\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.330\nAnd honestly ladies and gentlemen,\nbe very careful again, like I said,\n\n281\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.250\nwhen you're running in these\nelevated commands prompts,\n\n282\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.500\nbecause you see, and I made some mistakes.\n\n283\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.650\nI wish I could say, hey,\nman, I meant to do that.\n\n284\n00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.200\nWell, you make mistakes, right?\n\n285\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.068\nAnd we try to keep some\nof the mistakes in here.\n\n286\n00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:31.251\nIt's just so\nyou guys know that we're humans, right?\n\n287\n00:14:31.251 --> 00:14:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, and it just goes to show you.\n\n288\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.150\nYou don't have to be some savant\nwho has memorized these things.\n\n289\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.050\nI mean, you can,\nthat's fine, that's awesome.\n\n290\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.210\nSome people do that.\n\n291\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.176\nBut as long as you're familiar with it,\nyou should be able to go, okay,\n\n292\n00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:46.137\nwell I know what I need to kind of do.\n\n293\n00:14:46.137 --> 00:14:48.405\nI'm familiar with what\nI should kind of do.\n\n294\n00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:50.928\nAnd now let me start working\nmy way through it, and\n\n295\n00:14:50.928 --> 00:14:54.428\nthen all will come rushing back to\nyou as you work your way through it.\n\n296\n00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:55.102\nThat's how I do it.\n\n297\n00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.506\nI know that's how Wes does it.\n\n298\n00:14:56.506 --> 00:14:58.506\nSome things you just don't\ndo on a daily basis.\n\n299\n00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:02.241\nSo it's one of those things\nthat if you don't use it,\n\n300\n00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:04.736\nyou'll lose it type of skill sets.\n\n301\n00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:07.979\nSo every now and then, you'll have to do\nthis and it will dust the rust off of\n\n302\n00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:11.654\nthat, and it will sharpen that back up,\nand you'll feel a little fresher about it.\n\n303\n00:15:11.654 --> 00:15:13.709\nAnd then, two years will pass,\nand then you'll use it again.\n\n304\n00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:17.040\nYou won't have to fumble your way\nthrough it, and rather, rinse, repeat.\n\n305\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.140\nIt's just part of the job.\n\n306\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.320\nSo don't feel stymied that,\nI can't remember all these commands.\n\n307\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what I was just gonna say\nhere like for instance we can also\n\n308\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.630\ncreate things like virtual hard drives,\nI don't do it a lot in disk part.\n\n309\n00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.280\nI've got the steps when I'm preparing for\na show, I've got them memorized.\n\n310\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.080\nBut just like Dan said,\nI've got to pull out the notes, right?\n\n311\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.910\nBecause it's been two years\nmaybe since I've last done it.\n\n312\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.480\nSo I have to make sure that\nI get my syntax right.\n\n313\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.850\nI wish I had a dollar for every time Dan,\nmyself, Mike out there, Don Pezet,\n\n314\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.024\none of the smartest people\nI know in computing, right?\n\n315\n00:15:48.024 --> 00:15:51.310\nRonnie, another one of the smartest\npeople I know when it comes to computing.\n\n316\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.855\nCherokee out there, Justin when it\ncomes to programming and stuff.\n\n317\n00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:58.405\nVonne, when it comes to Office,\nwe all push away from that desk and\n\n318\n00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:00.885\nwe're like, I hate you computer.\n\n319\n00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:01.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n320\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.000\njust understand, that's the reason\nyou're here, you're here to learn.\n\n321\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.890\nAnd just because you learn, doesn't\nmean that you're gonna stop learning.\n\n322\n00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.756\nAnd it certainly doesn't mean that\nyou won't cease to forget, right,\n\n323\n00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:15.080\non a daily basis too, sometimes.\n\n324\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.250\nI'll speak for myself on that one.\n\n325\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.703\nAll right, so a couple of the other\nthings that wanna kind of move on here.\n\n326\n00:16:19.703 --> 00:16:21.243\nI said it was going to be shorter, but\n\n327\n00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:24.702\nit's probably gonna be just as long as any\nother episode if I keep talking so much.\n\n328\n00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:29.390\nI wanna talk about two repair utilities\nthat are also known as commands inside of\n\n329\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.840\nthe commend prompt, as well.\n\n330\n00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.490\nAnd if we can take a look at my screen,\none is known as Check Disk.\n\n331\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.350\nSo chkdsk, and I'm gonna go ahead and do\na forward slash question mark on this one,\n\n332\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.510\ncuz this will require a restart.\n\n333\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.940\nAnd I don't want you guys to wait for\nthe restart.\n\n334\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.964\nThere's two options that I want you to\nbe able to remember, it's /F and /R.\n\n335\n00:16:50.964 --> 00:16:56.035\n/F, if you will, it will try to find\nfiles that are located in bad sectors or\n\n336\n00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:58.270\nfailing sectors on a hard drive.\n\n337\n00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.995\nAnd what it will do is it will try to\nrecover those, if you will, with the /R\n\n338\n00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:07.880\nswitch if they're recovered, and\nmove them to another portion of the disk.\n\n339\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.233\nLet me show you, if I do a space forward\nslash question mark, you can see,\n\n340\n00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:14.916\nladies and gentleman, there's a lot here.\n\n341\n00:17:14.916 --> 00:17:19.350\nBut these are the big ones\nI want you to remember.\n\n342\n00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.480\nSo fixing errors on the disk, and\nR goes a little bit farther, and\n\n343\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.850\nit locates bad sectors and\nrecovers readable information.\n\n344\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.700\nI usually run this one by default,\nand here's why,\n\n345\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.910\nnotice what it says, implies /F.\n\n346\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.030\nSo in running this one, I'm essentially\nrunning both of these at the same\n\n347\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.728\ntime, so of I-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it has to at least find these\n\n348\n00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:42.958\nerrors before it can\neven attempt to fix them.\n\n349\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.441\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, so if I'm already\ngonna spend the time on a 1 terabyte drive\n\n350\n00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.003\ntrying to find all of these errors,\nwhy not just go ahead and\n\n351\n00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:50.717\nfix them while you're there, right?\n\n352\n00:17:50.717 --> 00:17:51.270\n&gt;&gt; Valid point.\n\n353\n00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.760\n&gt;&gt; You get two things done at one time.\n\n354\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.077\nYou could also run this in\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n355\n00:17:56.077 --> 00:17:57.483\nwe should you in another episode.\n\n356\n00:17:57.483 --> 00:18:01.070\nI know it's not here, but\nlet me go ahead and jump down here.\n\n357\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.222\nWe'll get into Computer,\nif you right-click on Computer and\n\n358\n00:18:04.222 --> 00:18:06.486\nyou choose Properties,\nand you go to Tools.\n\n359\n00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:09.441\nError-checking right here,\nthis is the same thing,\n\n360\n00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:12.860\nthis is just a graphical user\ninterface of Check Disk, right?\n\n361\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.450\nAnd notice that these\nare your GUI interface.\n\n362\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.030\nAnd you know Dan,\nI might just take a second,\n\n363\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.110\nI didn't really plan to pull this up.\n\n364\n00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.950\nBut remember we were talking about how\ncommand prompt gives you access to so\n\n365\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.710\nmuch more,\na command line interpreter does?\n\n366\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.750\nAnd I told you if they didn't have\na button you couldn't perform it.\n\n367\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.870\nLook at the two options that I get here,\nI get essentially /R or /F.\n\n368\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.040\nBut if we jump down to the command prompt,\n\n369\n00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.450\nwhat happens to all these\nother switches here?\n\n370\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.740\nSo it just goes to show\nyou that an interpreter,\n\n371\n00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.240\nyou have a lot more freedom, a lot more,\nI don't want to say flexibility.\n\n372\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Options.\n\n373\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Options, thank you, yeah, a lot more\npower, if you will, that you can perform.\n\n374\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.670\nSo I'm glad you guys get\na chance to see that.\n\n375\n00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.850\nAnother one that's a long\nthat same lines is the SFC,\n\n376\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.890\nSierra Foxtrot Charlie if you will,\nand that is the system file checker.\n\n377\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.900\nAnd I'm not gonna run this one again,\nbecause this is also\n\n378\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.330\none that could take a long time,\nespecially if you have a large hard drive.\n\n379\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.515\nBut I do want to mention,\nlet's see, at least two of these.\n\n380\n00:19:12.515 --> 00:19:15.288\n/SCANNOW is the one that really, I like,\n\n381\n00:19:15.288 --> 00:19:18.607\nscan the integrity of all\nprotected file systems.\n\n382\n00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:22.620\nThere's a little bit different\nutilization for this.\n\n383\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.160\nSo give it a scenario on the exam, is what\nthey like to say with the objectives.\n\n384\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.690\nIf I'm looking for\nerrors on a hard drive and\n\n385\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.240\nfiles that could be corrupted,\nwe wanna try to protect them and\n\n386\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.660\ntry to rebuild them,\nthat's great, you're on that.\n\n387\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.520\nThat might include system files, but\nit might also include your banana\n\n388\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.476\nbread recipe that's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:19:40.476 --> 00:19:42.019\n&gt;&gt; In your user profile.\n\n390\n00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:45.900\nThis doesn't do anything to\nthe banana bread recipe, right?\n\n391\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.580\nNotice that if I run the /SCANNOW option,\nnotice what it says.\n\n392\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.950\nScan the integrity of all protected\nsystem files and repair those files.\n\n393\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.800\nSo this is really good if you think,\nin a recovery environment,\n\n394\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.360\nthat you start getting these intermittent\nproblems with the operating system,\n\n395\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.710\nmaybe you think you've got a virus.\n\n396\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.710\nYou've fixed the virus, right,\nyou're quarantined it, you've removed it.\n\n397\n00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.763\nBut the damage is done,\n\n398\n00:20:06.763 --> 00:20:09.617\nwell this sometimes can be one of\nthose commands that helps you.\n\n399\n00:20:09.617 --> 00:20:13.744\nA couple of the other ones that we have\nas well, let me go ahead and, oop,\n\n400\n00:20:13.744 --> 00:20:17.390\nclear the screen here by\ntyping the right command.\n\n401\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.990\nWe have gpupdate and we have gpresult.\n\n402\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.640\nThese are for, typically when you're\ninside a corporate environment, so\n\n403\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.840\nthey do run on local machine too.\n\n404\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.670\nBut this machine isn't\nin a domain environment,\n\n405\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.280\nwhere another computer is actually\npushing out policies to it.\n\n406\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.420\nHowever, we do have the local security\npolicy that I've mentioned in other\n\n407\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.652\nepisodes, so you can see it here too.\n\n408\n00:20:40.652 --> 00:20:45.670\nAnd gpupdate, especially for instance,\nwith a space forward slash switch option,\n\n409\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.310\nallows me to update something known\nas GPOs or Group Policy Objects.\n\n410\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.110\nDon't let that fool you, don't let\nthat at the A+ level confuse you.\n\n411\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.470\nGroup policy is a way that I can define,\nas an administrator, the settings and\n\n412\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.120\nhow things are going to be configured,\nright?\n\n413\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.842\nNotice it works on the local machine,\nit also works on,\n\n414\n00:21:02.842 --> 00:21:05.320\nin fact,\nsomething like a corporate machine.\n\n415\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.468\nSo let me go ahead, and\nthis one is joined to the domain.\n\n416\n00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:12.070\nWhich means that it's going to receive,\nit's gonna reach out\n\n417\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.830\nto the domain controller,\nto the other server, a computer out there.\n\n418\n00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.210\nAnd it's gonna pull down any settings\nthat it needs to apply to the machine.\n\n419\n00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.070\nSo we're really running just\nabout the same thing here.\n\n420\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.295\nSo let me go ahead and launch up this\ncommand prompt, clear the screen out here.\n\n421\n00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:29.298\nAnd I'm gonna run gpupdate space /force.\n\n422\n00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:31.794\nIf I run gpupdate, it might wait a bit,\n\n423\n00:21:31.794 --> 00:21:37.415\ncause there's a little refresh cycle that\nit takes, but don't worry about that here.\n\n424\n00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:40.245\nBut I just always run it\nwith the /force option,\n\n425\n00:21:40.245 --> 00:21:42.835\nbecause what it does is\nit's not using the force.\n\n426\n00:21:42.835 --> 00:21:44.255\nThese are the droids you're looking for.\n\n427\n00:21:44.255 --> 00:21:45.055\nIt's actually telling me,\n\n428\n00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:49.080\nI don't care what's going on right now,\ncommunicate with that other computer.\n\n429\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.580\nPull down these settings and\napply them to the machine.\n\n430\n00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.920\nAnd as an administrator that might\nbe something that you wanna do.\n\n431\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.150\nNow, how do I know if it's applied and\n\n432\n00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.980\nwhat settings do I know that\nare applied to the machine?\n\n433\n00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.650\nWell that's where gpresult comes in.\n\n434\n00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.070\nAnd if we do gpesult, and be careful\nwith this one, I always wanna say,\n\n435\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.680\nhere's two syntax errors, Dan,\nthat I can't get over to save my life.\n\n436\n00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.600\nI always wanna put an s on\nthe end of this, gpresults.\n\n437\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.915\nAnd, for some reason, when I do\na gpupdate, I always spell it gpudate.\n\n438\n00:22:17.915 --> 00:22:20.622\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I forget that second,\n\n439\n00:22:20.622 --> 00:22:24.758\nevidently the second letter p,\nits a silent p, right?\n\n440\n00:22:24.758 --> 00:22:26.854\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the manufacturer of your graphic\n\n441\n00:22:26.854 --> 00:22:27.832\nprocessing unit.\n\n442\n00:22:27.832 --> 00:22:29.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n443\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.300\nSo remember its gpresult,\nnot gpresults, and\n\n444\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.040\neven if you see me in future episodes\ntyping it this way, it is gpresult.\n\n445\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.270\nAnd what this does is,\nI'm pretty sure it'll error out,\n\n446\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.130\nyeah, if I don't put a switch.\n\n447\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.710\nIt'll show me the results of\nwhat that gpupdate did, right?\n\n448\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.245\nI wanna know what settings\nare applying in the machine, but\n\n449\n00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:54.609\nI have to use the letter R here, switch,\nand that's something known as RSoP.\n\n450\n00:22:54.609 --> 00:22:57.918\nI don't know, do they say it,\nyeah, they say RSoP.\n\n451\n00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.674\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthat's results and set up policy,\n\n452\n00:23:00.674 --> 00:23:03.330\nthat's a highly technical term for\nshow me the results.\n\n453\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.023\n&gt;&gt; Show me what it did.\n\n454\n00:23:04.023 --> 00:23:04.814\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, show me what it did.\n\n455\n00:23:04.814 --> 00:23:06.090\n[LAUGH] I like that even better.\n\n456\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.643\nSo when we run that we'll do gpupdate,\n\n457\n00:23:09.643 --> 00:23:14.410\nthere again, we don't need the gpupdate or\nwhatever it was I was trying to spell.\n\n458\n00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.081\nWe're gonna do gpresults spase /R.\n\n459\n00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:20.820\nAnd you'll notice that it runs through,\ngives me the result and set up policy.\n\n460\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.320\nIt says hey, here's the machine, here's\nwhere it's located in that database,\n\n461\n00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.910\nthat collection of computer accounts.\n\n462\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.760\nHere are the policies that applied,\nin this case there's only one.\n\n463\n00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.800\nIt tells me all the groups that\nthis computer is a part of.\n\n464\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.080\nAnd then it tells me the settings,\nif you will, or the user settings,\n\n465\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.860\nlikewise, that are applied to it, right?\n\n466\n00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.890\nI can see this information if I want,\nI could also change the scope.\n\n467\n00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.972\nIf I say, you know what Dan?\n\n468\n00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:53.207\nDan calls me up and says, hey Wes,\n\n469\n00:23:53.207 --> 00:23:55.250\nI need you to tell me what\nthe computer settings are.\n\n470\n00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.368\nWell, I can actually change the scope.\n\n471\n00:23:56.368 --> 00:24:00.700\nI can do a gp Result space forward slash,\nI can define scope and\n\n472\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.282\nthen I don't think you have to add\nanything, any forward slash or\n\n473\n00:24:05.282 --> 00:24:09.800\nany even pipe character,\nI think you just type computer.\n\n474\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.600\nYou know what?\n\n475\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.560\nI apparently have that wrong,\nlet me see here and\n\n476\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.540\na /?,\nwhich is the good thing we have the /?.\n\n477\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.860\nSo you could actually change the scope and\nyou can say hey,\n\n478\n00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:29.260\njust show me what the scope is.\n\n479\n00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.919\nIt does look like it is scope.\n\n480\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.620\nDid I spell computer wrong?\n\n481\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.680\nI probably spelled computer wrong, right?\n\n482\n00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.310\nOr maybe you have to do a forward slash?\n\n483\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.170\nThey're usually not case sensitive.\n\n484\n00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.684\nBut [SOUND] I'll tell you what, let's try\nthis one more time and I'll try user.\n\n485\n00:24:47.747 --> 00:24:50.460\nYeah okay so maybe it's case sensitive.\n\n486\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.380\nUsually these aren't case sensitive\neither but, you know what it is?\n\n487\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.930\nNo it is an administrative command prompt.\n\n488\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.800\nI'm going to try one more time.\n\n489\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.960\nI don't think again,\nlike I said that it's case sensitive but\n\n490\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.760\nwho knows maybe it is, all right let me go\nahead and clear the screen on this one.\n\n491\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.120\nYou know what I think it is Dan.\n\n492\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.880\nLet me just, let me go ahead and\njust kind of recreate that error again.\n\n493\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.980\nNotice it says the syntax is wrong, and\n\n494\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.100\nit says this option can only be\nspecified with da, da, da, da, da.\n\n495\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.530\nWell Dan would tell me,\nwell yeah you typed it wrong.\n\n496\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.660\nI could see that for sure.\n\n497\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:27.920\nRemember I said that if I just gpresult by\nitself, it doesn't give me any results.\n\n498\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.250\nI need to actually say result instead\nof policy, that's the switch I meant.\n\n499\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.850\nWhat I'm telling it to is give\nme the result instead of policy,\n\n500\n00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:40.430\nI'm going to scope it, just tell\nme what the computer settings are.\n\n501\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.300\nAnd there it runs, that's a bet,\nagain syntax, syntax, syntax.\n\n502\n00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.340\nSo that was the problem with that one,\nnow, so\n\n503\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.870\nthose are a couple of the different ones.\n\n504\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.780\nAgain, a lot of times\nwhat you'll use these for\n\n505\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.940\nis more in corporate type environments.\n\n506\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.260\nHowever, keep in mind that you can also\nuse it on local security policy as well.\n\n507\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:01.180\nBut really when we're using security\npolicy, or group policy like this,\n\n508\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.460\nwe're really using this more\nin the corporate environments.\n\n509\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.820\nSo that's something that\nyou can see there as well,\n\n510\n00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.800\nas well is running this on\ndomain joint computers.\n\n511\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.510\nOne last one that I wanna mention,\nis called the expand command.\n\n512\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.330\nAnd what the expand command, this is for\n\n513\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.160\nwhen you are extracting out\nthings like drivers, right?\n\n514\n00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.490\nAnd you can see these cab files, right?\n\n515\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.210\nAnd a cab files a collection of files and\n\n516\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.580\ninside of it one of the things that I\nmight be wanting to do is expand out,\n\n517\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.420\nessentially those drivers that\nare within that cab file.\n\n518\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.450\nWell you can do that with\nthe expand option here.\n\n519\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:42.070\nI don't really use this one a lot, but\nit is there and it is one that I just kind\n\n520\n00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.041\nof want to mention so that we've got\neveryone taking care of our list.\n\n521\n00:26:46.041 --> 00:26:48.820\nSo a lot of different commands,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n522\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.700\nWe know that it might seem a little\ntricky and you could see right there,\n\n523\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.170\nI've been using a lot of these\ncommands for very long time.\n\n524\n00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:58.000\nI type one thing wrong or\nI miss a switch and it causes problems.\n\n525\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.890\nI want you guys and gals out there to\nget into the chat or not the chatroom,\n\n526\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.590\nget into the command prompt,\ndo the same thing.\n\n527\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.100\nWhatever you do just take small steps,\nbefore you try to run,\n\n528\n00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.750\ndon't expect to be scripting\nadministrators overnight by any means.\n\n529\n00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.610\nDon't let it intimidate you,\njust practice it.\n\n530\n00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.410\nBreak out the Graphical User Interface and\ncompare it to what you already maybe know\n\n531\n00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.350\nif, well, you're a little bit\nmore familiar within the GUI so\n\n532\n00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.860\nthat you can give yourself\na little bit of these way markers.\n\n533\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.940\nIt'll make it a lot easier when you try\nto remember these commands if you're\n\n534\n00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.370\npracticing them and\nyou also got some kind of reference model.\n\n535\n00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.580\nSo keep that in mind and hopefully you'll\nbe very successful on the 902 exam\n\n536\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.920\nany time they ask you\nabout the command prompt.\n\n537\n00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.220\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes thanks for\nyour advice on that and thanks for\n\n538\n00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.360\nshowing us all these cool command line\nutilities that we have inside our\n\n539\n00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.792\nWindows Operating system that\nare pertinent for our A+ exam.\n\n540\n00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:51.590\nBut I'm looking at our clock and\n\n541\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.415\nI know you say that this was gonna be a\nshort episode, well Wes is a big fat liar.\n\n542\n00:27:54.415 --> 00:27:56.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's cool, right.\n\n543\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.030\nWe got it all in and\nyou guys are now well equipped.\n\n544\n00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.380\nSo we're gonna call it a day for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n545\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.733\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes always lying Bryan.\n\n546\n00:28:04.733 --> 00:28:07.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n547\n00:28:07.429 --> 00:28:13.363\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:28:13.363 --> 00:28:16.595\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.595\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:17.410\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.277\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, it is all about our A+ series,\n\n7\n00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:26.820\nspecifically the software side of things,\nright, the 220-902 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.029\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain to continue lending his expertise so\n\n9\n00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.140\nthat we might become experts, ourselves,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.200\nWes, glad to have you, man.\n\n11\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.899\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.911\nGlad to be here, as always.\n\n14\n00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.721\nWell, that's right we're\ngoing to be looking at, well,\n\n15\n00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.478\nWindows tools in this episode here.\n\n16\n00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:45.473\nAnd probably gonna be a couple of parts,\n\n17\n00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:49.287\nbecause we've got a good handful of\nutilities that you need to be aware of, so\n\n18\n00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:51.710\nwe're gonna do a little deep dive here,\nright?\n\n19\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.440\nSo be prepared to learn\na little bit about these tools.\n\n20\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.839\nNow, when we talk about Windows tools,\nremember Windows has some built-in\n\n21\n00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.383\ndiagnostic software, they have some\nbuilt-in troubleshooting utilities.\n\n22\n00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:07.483\nAnd when it comes to software in general,\n\n23\n00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:13.518\nthere's probably some people that will\nsay, well I use this piece of software.\n\n24\n00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:18.750\nI got it from such and such software\ndeveloper, and I really like it.\n\n25\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100\nSome people might actually use\nsome of these that are built in.\n\n26\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.564\nAnd I want you to keep in mind that third\nparty software is absolutely great.\n\n27\n00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.479\nI mean, these are what these programmers,\nand manufacturers and software developers,\n\n28\n00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.550\nthis is what they're in business for,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.820\nThey can make a really superior product,\nbut one of the things you have to\n\n30\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.140\nadmire about the different\noperating systems developers.\n\n31\n00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.281\nAnd again, doesn't matter if it's Windows,\ndoesn't matter if it's Linux,\n\n32\n00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:49.679\nUnix, Mac, is the fact that you\ndo have onboard utilities, right?\n\n33\n00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.510\nWhat's the benefit of an onboard utility?\n\n34\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.610\nWell, the fact that it's there and\nif you have your operating system already,\n\n35\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.970\nyou don't have to pay for it.\n\n36\n00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.150\nAnd that's a great thing.\n\n37\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.180\nIt's a great thing to have\nat least a selection,\n\n38\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.370\nto have options without having\nto go to a third party.\n\n39\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.210\nDo some of the third party\nutilities maybe, or potentially,\n\n40\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.680\nwork better than some of\nthe ones that are onboard?\n\n41\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.245\nYeah, probably, right?\n\n42\n00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:17.933\nProbably, again cuz remember, software\ndevelopers out there that are specializing\n\n43\n00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:21.380\nin diagnostic and troubleshooting\nsoftware, that's their bread and butter.\n\n44\n00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.910\nThat's what they\nare strictly focused on and\n\n45\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.990\na lot of times you can get\nsome really superior products.\n\n46\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.812\nBut like any operating system,\n\n47\n00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:33.201\nit's nice that the operating system\nmanufacturers give you some things that\n\n48\n00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.609\nare already bundled inside when you\ndeploy an operating system to a machine.\n\n49\n00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.580\nSo that you can help maintain\nits stability and up time.\n\n50\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.720\nCuz when it comes to an operating system,\n\n51\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680\nremember that's one of the things that\nwe always want to keep in mind, right?\n\n52\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.880\nWe want stability in the operating system.\n\n53\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.132\nWe want usability, right?\n\n54\n00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:52.990\nAnd we want that to be maintained.\n\n55\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.010\nAnd so we're gonna be looking\nat some of the utilities and\n\n56\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.490\ntools that are inside of\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n57\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.000\nWe're not worried about\nthird party vendors.\n\n58\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.233\nAnd one of the great things I want you\nguys and gals to know out there is that\n\n59\n00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:08.480\nCompTIA doesn't want you know a lot\nof the third party software either.\n\n60\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.564\nCuz there's so many options out there,\nit would be very, very hard, right?\n\n61\n00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.601\nIf we were talking about third\nparty options out there,\n\n62\n00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.172\nthis would probably be a two week episode.\n\n63\n00:03:15.172 --> 00:03:17.464\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It would be a course within itself,\n\n64\n00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:18.420\nto be honest with you.\n\n65\n00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.806\nI mean, how could you even begin to cover\nthird party tools that do the exact\n\n66\n00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:23.582\nsame thing.\n\n67\n00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:27.553\nThat's the whole nature of the business\nout there, is competitive.\n\n68\n00:03:27.553 --> 00:03:30.865\nThat Wes makes a product and I go man,\nit was a really good product,\n\n69\n00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:31.890\nonly if it did this.\n\n70\n00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.580\nAnd then I make a product very similar\nto that that adds that feature.\n\n71\n00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.980\nWell now, we're in competition and\nsomebody says man,\n\n72\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.280\nDaniel's product's great as well.\n\n73\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.210\nI'm gonna make one like, but\n\n74\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.990\nonly if it did that a little better,\nit would be even better.\n\n75\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.060\nYou know what?\nI can do that.\n\n76\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.870\nAnd they make a product.\n\n77\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.390\nSo that would be beyond\nthe scope of anybody's ability.\n\n78\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.549\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n79\n00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.602\nAnd then you look at other\noperating systems like Linux?\n\n80\n00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:52.350\nForget it.\n\n81\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.418\nThere are so many bundled in utilities,\nand tools, and\n\n82\n00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:59.858\napplications that you can get to maintain\nthat operating system that even that,\n\n83\n00:03:59.858 --> 00:04:02.751\nin and of itself,\nwould probably be its own course.\n\n84\n00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:07.507\nSo we're gonna focus on some of the most\ncommon utilities that you see inside of\n\n85\n00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:09.320\nyour Windows environments.\n\n86\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.519\nAnd one of the reasons we're\nkinda Windows-centric so far,\n\n87\n00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.810\nis the fact that, well,\n\n88\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.323\nand Dan, I think you've mentioned this one\nof our earlier episodes that we recorded.\n\n89\n00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:22.652\nIs that it is so\nprevalent inside of your corporate\n\n90\n00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:27.310\nenvironments today,\nlet alone home use scenarios.\n\n91\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.429\nAll right, so we are looking at,\nI give you guys and\n\n92\n00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:33.090\ngals out there the formal objective here.\n\n93\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.526\nWe're looking at 1.4, given a scenario,\n\n94\n00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:39.028\nuse appropriate Microsoft operating\nsystem features and tools.\n\n95\n00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:42.036\nWell you guys, if you have been following\nalong at home and watching some of\n\n96\n00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:44.968\nthe other episodes, we talked pretty\nheavily about features, right?\n\n97\n00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:48.840\nI think we had four parts\nto one objective there.\n\n98\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.679\nSo we're gonna be just kinda getting\naway from some of the features,\n\n99\n00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.655\nif you will, and\nlooking at the utilities and tools,\n\n100\n00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:58.722\nif you will, and\nthe features of those tools, right?\n\n101\n00:04:58.722 --> 00:05:00.139\nSo that's what we'll dive in here.\n\n102\n00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:00.795\nAll right, so\n\n103\n00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:04.203\nthe first thing on our list today that\nwe have is administrative, right?\n\n104\n00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:07.210\nThey talk about administrative\ntools in general.\n\n105\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.282\nWell, they just say these\nare the utilities that we use for\n\n106\n00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:11.730\nadministration, right?\n\n107\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.123\nAnd there is a category called\nAdministrative Tools and\n\n108\n00:05:15.123 --> 00:05:19.610\nwe have to be able to figure out how\ndo we get to these different locations.\n\n109\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.850\nNow one of the great things\nto keep in mind is that it's\n\n110\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.753\npretty common across all of your\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n111\n00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:30.053\nAnd we're gonna show three\ndifferent operating system and\n\n112\n00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:32.430\nhow to get to these administrative tools.\n\n113\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.000\nSo, let's go ahead,\nlet's take our trip back in time,\n\n114\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.480\nand we'll go all the way back to Vista.\n\n115\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.589\nSo, I've got a Vista machine here,\nand if we take a look at it, right?\n\n116\n00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.840\nWe haven't, out of the box we have done\nnothing to this Vista machine, right?\n\n117\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.280\nI still have the Welcome Center up here\nwhich means this is a fresh installation\n\n118\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.850\nof Windows,\n\n119\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.810\nand later we'll get into the installation\nand how you install the operating system.\n\n120\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.229\nBut if we're gonna get to\nour administrative tools,\n\n121\n00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.285\nwe're gonna go to the Start button, right?\n\n122\n00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:01.920\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel.\n\n123\n00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.011\nAnd we want you to know this, right?\n\n124\n00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.124\nWe need you to understand that they might\ngive you a text-based answer on the exam,\n\n125\n00:06:08.124 --> 00:06:09.904\nso notice that it is Control Panel.\n\n126\n00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:14.220\nAnd we've also mentioned this in some of\nthe features that System and Maintenance,\n\n127\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.374\nin the category view,\n\n128\n00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:19.290\nis what it's called when you're going\nto Administrative Tools, as well.\n\n129\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.230\nGo to System and Maintenance, and\n\n130\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.020\nwe scroll all the way\ndown to the bottom here.\n\n131\n00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.110\nAnd at the bottom is Administrative Tools.\n\n132\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.550\nAnd we'll go ahead and launch that.\n\n133\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.210\nNow, we'll get into some of\nthe more common ones in here\n\n134\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.810\nin just a second coming up.\n\n135\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.150\nSo, that's how we get to it in Vista.\n\n136\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.900\nAll right, now we also have, and let me\nsee if I can find my Windows 7 machine.\n\n137\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.710\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll move forward in Windows 7.\n\n138\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.589\nNotice that we're gonna go to\nthe Start button yet again, right?\n\n139\n00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:52.330\nSo far we are in pretty much\nthe same location, Control Panel.\n\n140\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.746\nBut however, remember, that in\nthe category view it is named something\n\n141\n00:06:55.746 --> 00:06:59.510\nslightly different, it is System and\nSecurity, not System and Maintenance.\n\n142\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.086\nAnd that could be something that they\nask you very specifically on the exam,\n\n143\n00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:07.805\nis knowing the difference between\nthe path in Windows 7, and\n\n144\n00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:10.400\nthe path inside of Windows Vista, right?\n\n145\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.480\nThey do call out things\nlike file structures and\n\n146\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.230\npaths specifically in other objectives.\n\n147\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.320\nThen once we get to System and\nSecurity, you'll notice that, well,\n\n148\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.960\nit's pretty much the same\nfrom here on out, right?\n\n149\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.740\nAdministrative Tools.\n\n150\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.470\nAll right, so that's how we get there.\n\n151\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.790\nNow, it's a little bit different\nin Windows 8.1, right?\n\n152\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.930\nIn Windows 8.1, we typically have\nwhat's known as the Start screen here.\n\n153\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.530\nAnd if I wanted to go to\nAdministrative Tools,\n\n154\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.570\nI could type in Control Panel, right?\n\n155\n00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.810\nThat's your search functionality, and\nI could bring up the Control Panel.\n\n156\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.831\nAnd I believe you can\nalso type administrative,\n\n157\n00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:45.081\nand I just started to type administrative,\nright?\n\n158\n00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.947\nAnd it shows you that we could get here,\nand sure enough,\n\n159\n00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:49.810\nhere are the Administrative Tools.\n\n160\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.558\nNow, you'll notice the list\nis a little bit longer.\n\n161\n00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:54.636\nThey introduced a couple of extra\nfunctionalities in there, like, for\n\n162\n00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:57.366\ninstance, the integrating\nscripting engine for Power Shell.\n\n163\n00:07:57.366 --> 00:08:01.385\nI'm not worried about that as\nfar as Our tools go for here.\n\n164\n00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:05.705\nHowever, I also want you to know, in\nWindows 8 and 8.1, the other thing you can\n\n165\n00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:09.370\ndo is use your little Start tile here,\nor Windows tile as they call it.\n\n166\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.960\nYou could right-click on it and\nyou can choose Control Panel here.\n\n167\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.420\nNotice that the great thing is,\nWindows 8 and 8.1,\n\n168\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.890\nthey don't change the category\nview's name here.\n\n169\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.210\nIt's still System and Security, and\n\n170\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.450\nthat's a great thing for\nmemorization on the exam.\n\n171\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.660\nAnd then if we look down here at\nthe bottom, Dan, no different,\n\n172\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.390\nwe have Administrative Tools, and again,\n\n173\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:35.930\nthree different operating system versions,\nif you will, in three different ways.\n\n174\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.860\nLargely it is going to be the same,\nall right?\n\n175\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.622\nSo let's go ahead, and\nwe'll focus in on just Windows 8.1, and\n\n176\n00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:47.978\nwe'll go down the list when it comes to\nsome of the different utilities that you\n\n177\n00:08:47.978 --> 00:08:51.050\ncould find inside of Administrative Tools.\n\n178\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.190\nNow one of the very first ones that\nthey call out is this guy right here,\n\n179\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.790\nright, Computer Management, right?\n\n180\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.770\nComputer Management is very,\nvery important.\n\n181\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.947\nAnd the reason I say that is if we launch\nComputer Management, one of the things\n\n182\n00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:07.145\nthat you're gonna notice is that it has\na lot of utilities built right into it.\n\n183\n00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:10.506\nIn fact, when we looked at some\nof the features of Event Viewer,\n\n184\n00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:14.432\nwe said on the left-hand side of our\nManagement Console here you would have\n\n185\n00:09:14.432 --> 00:09:15.575\nsome nodes, right?\n\n186\n00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:17.950\nWell, these nodes are also\nthe individual utilities.\n\n187\n00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.730\nAnd one of the things that I\nlike about Computer Management,\n\n188\n00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.430\nit's appropriately named because it really\nis kind of like the convenience store for\n\n189\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.460\napplications, Administrative Tools,\nif you will.\n\n190\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.980\nAnd the fact that it bundles in a lot of\ncommon utilities that we would use to\n\n191\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.400\nmanage and maintain the computer, and\nagain, maintain its uptime, right?\n\n192\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.670\nHowever, we also have to be careful\nbecause with Computer Management,\n\n193\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.680\neven though it is in Administrative Tools,\nI want you to know that, yes,\n\n194\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.460\nthere are multiple ways to\nget to Computer Management.\n\n195\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.137\nIn fact, if I right-click on\nthe Start charm here, if you will,\n\n196\n00:09:52.137 --> 00:09:57.340\nthe Windows charm, you can see that\nit is right in the list here, right?\n\n197\n00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.320\nWe have Computer Management right there,\nand I could launch it from there.\n\n198\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.500\nThe other thing, too,\n\n199\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.330\nis on the desktop if I was to launch\nup File Explorer, all right, and\n\n200\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:11.120\nwhen we launch up File Explorer, notice I\nhave in the hierarchy here, I have ThisPC.\n\n201\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.910\nAnd I can right-click and\nchoose Manage, and guess what?\n\n202\n00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.460\nSure enough, in the background, Computer\nManagement comes up that way, right?\n\n203\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.160\nIf I go to Windows 7, Windows 7 is kind\nof interesting because Windows 7, and\n\n204\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.500\nalso with Vista, if we look and\nwe push the Start button,\n\n205\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.320\nwe can actually right-click\non the computer location.\n\n206\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.832\nNotice there's Manage there, as well.\n\n207\n00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:36.100\nAnd again, it's the same\nthing inside of Vista, right?\n\n208\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.180\nAnd also with Windows Explorer if I\ngo ahead and close all of these down,\n\n209\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.100\nwe push the Start button,\nwe right-click on Computer.\n\n210\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.320\nNotice we have Manage, all right?\n\n211\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.100\nNow again, well, there's a user\naccount control that everybody loves.\n\n212\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.349\nWe'll go ahead and just continue there.\n\n213\n00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:53.253\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And notice that there are quite a few\n\n214\n00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:57.520\ndifferent ways to get\nto Computer Management.\n\n215\n00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.820\nOne of the ones that I didn't mention,\n\n216\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.940\nis you can also use what's\nknown as the run line command.\n\n217\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.010\nWe talked briefly about run line commands.\n\n218\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.420\nRemember, you can get to the run line\ncommand by using your Windows key and\n\n219\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.660\nthe letter R as a keyboard shortcut.\n\n220\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.750\nAnd you can type in what\nis known as compmgmt.msc.\n\n221\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.590\nAnd again, we tell you and we take the\ntime to go through these cuz I don't know\n\n222\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.210\nwhich one they're gonna\nask you on the exam.\n\n223\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.270\nAnd we really want you to\nhave all your bases covered.\n\n224\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.640\nI don't know exactly what's on the exam,\nbut\n\n225\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.840\nI've heard of each one of these\nfrom other students over the years.\n\n226\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.290\nThey were like,\nI didn't know what that was.\n\n227\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.920\nWell, guess what?\n\n228\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.905\nNow you do, and when you get these\nanswers on the exam you'll be able\n\n229\n00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:46.991\nto determine how they're asking\nyou to get to Computer Management.\n\n230\n00:11:46.991 --> 00:11:49.630\nAll right, so\nwhat is in Computer Management?\n\n231\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.890\nWell, there's a lot of different\nutilities that are here.\n\n232\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.293\nIn fact, what's kind of interesting is\nthey have quite a few here that they\n\n233\n00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:57.380\nmentioned on our list.\n\n234\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.310\n&gt;&gt; It really is like the big dog.\n\n235\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.600\nYou need to be familiar\nwith Computer Management.\n\n236\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.070\nForget the A+ exam.\n\n237\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:03.950\nYou're gonna be attacked.\n\n238\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.680\nYou're gonna go into IT writing and\nstarting a helpdesk somewhere.\n\n239\n00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.860\nYou need to help someone.\n\n240\n00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.561\nComputer Management is one of your\nde facto things you have to know.\n\n241\n00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:15.056\nYou have to be very familiar with\nit because it really does a lot of\n\n242\n00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:18.965\nthings that you're going to need to\ndo as a technician out in the field.\n\n243\n00:12:18.965 --> 00:12:20.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n244\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.113\nAnd one of the things that we kinda\nstress here, like Dan's doing right now,\n\n245\n00:12:24.113 --> 00:12:26.316\nis that it's not just\nabout what's on the exam,\n\n246\n00:12:26.316 --> 00:12:29.040\nit's also about practical\napplication in the real world.\n\n247\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.270\nBecause some of you might\nbe using this right now.\n\n248\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.030\nAnd you might not have any desire to\ngo into a certification endeavor, but\n\n249\n00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.410\nyou might wanna be a little more adequate,\nright, a little bit more efficient at\n\n250\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.430\njust doing basic help within inside\nof your corporate network, maybe for\n\n251\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.220\na promotion, or whatever.\n\n252\n00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.720\n&gt;&gt; Adept.\n&gt;&gt; Adept.\n\n253\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Word of the day calendar,\nguys, you got to get one.\n\n254\n00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.607\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nThere we go.\n\n255\n00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:51.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dictionary.com failed me today.\n\n256\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.480\nSo when we look at some of the different\nthings that we can do, right?\n\n257\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.660\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll go through the list here.\n\n258\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.200\nAnd I'm going to do these in the order\nthat we find them within the objectives.\n\n259\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:06.010\nIt isn't necessarily a way you find\nthem inside of our view here, right?\n\n260\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.960\nSo the very first one that they call out\nis actually the bottom of the stack, and\n\n261\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.590\nthat's Device Manager.\n\n262\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:15.210\nAll right, now Device Manager also\nhas its own location within Windows\n\n263\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.860\nin Administrative Tools, right?\n\n264\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.200\nSo Computer Management\nbundles it together.,\n\n265\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.780\nThat's why Dan calls it the big dog,\nright?\n\n266\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.780\nIt bundles all of this together, but\nit also has its location inside of\n\n267\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.540\nAdministrative Tools that we've\nalready shown you how to get to.\n\n268\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.990\nNow what do I do with Device Manager,\nright?\n\n269\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.680\nWhat is Device Manager about?\n\n270\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.915\n&gt;&gt; Well, you manage devices on it.\n\n271\n00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:34.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You manage devices, very good, Dan.\n\n272\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.229\nSee, that's why we keep him around here.\n\n273\n00:13:36.229 --> 00:13:38.491\n&gt;&gt; That's how I got my job\nin this business, man.\n\n274\n00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:40.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, think about the devices.\n\n275\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.190\nWhat are we managing in the devices?\n\n276\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.230\nWell, a device is a piece of hardware,\nright?\n\n277\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.380\nAnd with any piece of hardware, one of\nthe things that we need in order for\n\n278\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.560\nthe operating system to communicate with\nit, and this isn't specific to Windows,\n\n279\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.930\nis a driver.\n\n280\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.270\nRight, the driver is that manufacturer\n\n281\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.280\ndefined software that allows an operating\nsystem to communicate with it.\n\n282\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.340\nWithout drivers,\nwe can't communicate with the hardware.\n\n283\n00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.850\nIt becomes very,\nvery expensive paperweights, right?\n\n284\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.593\nOur operating system is what essentially\nallows us to control the hardware but\n\n285\n00:14:08.593 --> 00:14:11.499\nthrough the drivers is really\nhow we communicate with them.\n\n286\n00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:15.555\nSo I can see that categorized through\nhere are all the different device\n\n287\n00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:17.280\ncategories, right?\n\n288\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.520\nAnd if I need to manage any of the drivers\nthat I would find in these categories,\n\n289\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.800\nwell, there's a couple of\nthings that we can do.\n\n290\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.270\nSo for instance,\nI have Display adapter, right?\n\n291\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.840\nIf I expand Display adapter out, I can\nsay, well this is the device that we have.\n\n292\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.590\nYou could see it's a super video graphics\narray 3D support VMware device, right?\n\n293\n00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.953\nNow if I right-click on this device,\nyou can see that, well,\n\n294\n00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:39.841\nwhat are some of the things\nthat we can do, right?\n\n295\n00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:42.530\nWe can update driver software.\n\n296\n00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.550\nI can disable the device.\n\n297\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.650\nNow be careful of disabling\nthe device cuz when you do that,\n\n298\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.540\nthat means we say you\nwanna manage the device.\n\n299\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.830\nWell, if you disable it,\nyou can't communicate with it.\n\n300\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.970\nUninstall, well,\nwhen we uninstall a device,\n\n301\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.850\nI want you to understand what that really\ndoes is it uninstalls the drivers.\n\n302\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.030\nSo be very careful in doing that\ncuz you uninstall a device,\n\n303\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:06.230\nthat doesn't mean magically it is being\nuninstalled from the motherboard itself or\n\n304\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.415\nwhatever component it might be.\n\n305\n00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:10.520\nIt just means that you're no longer\ngonna be able to communicate with it.\n\n306\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.105\nNow the great thing with Plug and\nPlay today, remember Plug and\n\n307\n00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:16.685\nPlay is a technology that\nallows me to install a device.\n\n308\n00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:20.465\nThe driver can communicate or the\noperating system could communicate with\n\n309\n00:15:20.465 --> 00:15:24.165\nthe Plug and Play subsystem and find\ndrivers that are already bundled in with\n\n310\n00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:28.215\nWindows, configure it,\ndo all the resource allocation,\n\n311\n00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:31.428\nget it ready to go without us\nhaving to interfere with it, right?\n\n312\n00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:34.730\nWell, there used to be a time where\nsometimes they would call it plug and\n\n313\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.280\npray, they wouldn't call it plug and play.\n\n314\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.601\nWhat that meant is that when\nyou plug the device in,\n\n315\n00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:42.390\nWindows doesn't know what the device is.\n\n316\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.630\nThere's no driver for it.\n\n317\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.491\nSo you might have to manually implement\nthe scan for hardware changes.\n\n318\n00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:49.544\nNow if we take a look at\nproperties that we can also,\n\n319\n00:15:49.544 --> 00:15:53.101\nwe can find a little bit more\nabout the device here, right?\n\n320\n00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:56.158\nWe get a general information\nabout the device, right?\n\n321\n00:15:56.158 --> 00:15:58.096\nWe can see what the device type is.\n\n322\n00:15:58.096 --> 00:16:01.299\nWe can see the location of\nthe resources that it uses, and\n\n323\n00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:06.400\nwe can also see a general level of the\nstatus that is associated with the device.\n\n324\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.470\nAll right, now I talked about\nmanaging drivers, right, and\n\n325\n00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.680\nwe can see what the driver is,\nwe can see the driver version, right.\n\n326\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.080\nAnd we can also see, and\n\n327\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.980\nthis is good information cuz keep it\nmind that drivers get updated, right?\n\n328\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.730\nUpdating a driver means a lot of times\nit fixes bugs, functionality flaws and\n\n329\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.940\neven sometimes expands the functionality.\n\n330\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.150\nWell, you need to know,\nare your drivers currently up to date?\n\n331\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.860\nWell, I could choose the update driver.\n\n332\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.970\nBut keep it mind when you choose\nthe update driver, what you're doing.\n\n333\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.300\nCuz you're really just communicating\nwith Microsoft's update servers.\n\n334\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.190\nAnd Microsoft goes through\na pretty rigorous process\n\n335\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.960\nto make sure any drivers that\nare found in Windows Update\n\n336\n00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.590\ndon't have an adverse effect on the\noperating system and can crash it, right?\n\n337\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.018\nThey got something known as\nthe Windows Hardware Quality Labs.\n\n338\n00:16:48.018 --> 00:16:52.675\nAnd the Windows Hardware Quality Labs\nis just a group of people that\n\n339\n00:16:52.675 --> 00:16:55.930\nrigorously test the drivers and\nthe devices.\n\n340\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.810\nAnd again, we don't wanna blue screens,\nBSODs if you will.\n\n341\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.960\nNow that doesn't mean that\nthey're gonna have the latest and\n\n342\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.210\ngreatest driver, right?\n\n343\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.160\nAnd that's because of that process\nensuring that there is stability,\n\n344\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.870\nso you might need to go to\nthe manufacturer's website.\n\n345\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.950\nAnd you might find out that maybe\nyou don't have the current driver.\n\n346\n00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.310\nWell, that would give you the ability,\nthat if you needed to,\n\n347\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.330\nyou could also install the driver.\n\n348\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:22.240\nIf you wanted to update the driver,\nlet's say you figured out,\n\n349\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.670\nhey I don't have the current driver.\n\n350\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.000\nI don't see it in the Windows update but\nI went to the manufacturer's website and\n\n351\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.740\nI did find it.\n\n352\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.127\nWell, I could always browse the computer.\n\n353\n00:17:31.127 --> 00:17:35.308\nDownload it if you will, from the\nmanufacturer's website to a thumb drive or\n\n354\n00:17:35.308 --> 00:17:37.710\na location within your operating system.\n\n355\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.110\nAnd directly point these\nUpdate Driver Software utility or\n\n356\n00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.350\nDevice Manager directly to the driver,\nso that you can update it.\n\n357\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.240\nAll right, so let me go ahead,\nand I'll close that down.\n\n358\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.370\nI do wanna talk a little bit, briefly,\nabout the driver details, cuz I want you,\n\n359\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.450\nladies and gentlemen out there,\nto know where your drivers are stored.\n\n360\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.060\nYou can see that the file path,\nthe file structure, right?\n\n361\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.770\nC:\\Windows\\system32 for\nsome of the drivers.\n\n362\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.320\nYou can also see the SysWOW64, but\n\n363\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.210\na lot of these drivers if\nI open up File Explorer.\n\n364\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.680\nWe go to Local Disk C, we go to Windows,\n\n365\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.080\nand I'm gonna sort this to make\nit a little bit easier, system32.\n\n366\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.930\nAnd you will see that\nwe have drivers here,\n\n367\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:27.470\nall right, I want you guys to\nknow that location for the exam.\n\n368\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.680\nRight, here are a lot of the drivers\nthat come bundled into Windows and\n\n369\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.520\nit is important.\n\n370\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.280\nNow understand that different drivers\ntalk to different system files, so\n\n371\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.340\nthat means you might have components\nwithin this driver that are scattered\n\n372\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.030\nthrough other places.\n\n373\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.870\nBut these are primarily where your\ndrivers are stored, all right?\n\n374\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.460\nNow I could also do things,\nlike I can Roll Back Drivers.\n\n375\n00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.660\nIn a situation that we've\ntalked about in other episodes,\n\n376\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.800\nwhere we need to enter a recovery\nenvironment cuz we updated the driver.\n\n377\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.815\nIt caused some kind of blue screen.\n\n378\n00:18:55.815 --> 00:18:57.540\nIts quality is being problematic.\n\n379\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.800\nWe talked about System Restore\nin other episodes.\n\n380\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.710\nWell, there's a way that I can boot\ninto something known as Safe Mode,\n\n381\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.430\nthat doesn't load this driver.\n\n382\n00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.330\nAnd it will give me the ability to\nroll back to the previously installed\n\n383\n00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.640\ndriver, all right?\n\n384\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.130\nAnd then you can see disabling the device\nand uninstalling the device as well.\n\n385\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.098\nSo all around Device Manager allows you,\njust like Dan said,\n\n386\n00:19:16.098 --> 00:19:18.150\nleading back to the very first thing.\n\n387\n00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.460\nManage those devices but know on the exam,\n\n388\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.350\nmore importantly one of the things\nthe Device Manager allows you to do\n\n389\n00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.200\nis manage the drivers that allow us\nto communicate with those devices.\n\n390\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.430\nAll right, so that is Device Manager.\n\n391\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.660\nLet's go ahead and\nwe're gonna go down the list here.\n\n392\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.370\nLadies and gentlemen, the next one that we\nhave to look at is what is known as, well,\n\n393\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.340\nLocal Users and Groups.\n\n394\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.960\nAll right, so\nif we take a look at my screen again,\n\n395\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.000\ngoing back to Computer Management here.\n\n396\n00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.490\nOne of the great things about\nComputer Management is we have\n\n397\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.630\nLocal Users and Groups.\n\n398\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.780\nSo now, Local Users and Groups,\nwhat does that mean for us, right?\n\n399\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.480\nWell, there's a couple of\ndifferent locations that your\n\n400\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.027\nuser accounts can be stored, right?\n\n401\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.630\nIf you're in a work group environment,\nthis is what's known in our networking\n\n402\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.720\nas a decentralized peer to peer type\ncommunication, a networking model.\n\n403\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.460\nWhat happens is, that means that this\noperating system is storing all the user\n\n404\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.780\naccounts, that's where we talked\nabout those user profiles, right?\n\n405\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.150\nThat's why they call it Local Users and\nGroups, right?\n\n406\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.550\nThat means those\nare accounts are instored,\n\n407\n00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.270\nif you will, on the local machine.\n\n408\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.050\nAnd that's important to understand,\nall right.\n\n409\n00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:25.080\nNow Local Users and Groups allows us\nthe ability to create a local user.\n\n410\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.920\nSo for instance, maybe I did want\nto create a New User, right?\n\n411\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.950\nI know Dan's gonna be part of the group,\nright?\n\n412\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.100\nAnd Dan needs an account.\n\n413\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.270\nSo I apparently can't type Dan.\n\n414\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.030\nI could spell Dan's name here,\nappropriately.\n\n415\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.420\nI could create an account, we could-\n&gt;&gt; It's a very difficult spelling.\n\n416\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.285\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it really is.\n\n417\n00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:45.620\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know there was no z in it.\n\n418\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.236\n&gt;&gt; The silent j throws everyone off.\n\n419\n00:20:47.236 --> 00:20:47.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n420\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.470\n&gt;&gt; And I could see that I could set\n\n421\n00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.500\na password here and\nI have a couple of options, right?\n\n422\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.020\nYou can set a generic password.\n\n423\n00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.500\nAnd then what I can do is I can tell Dan,\nhey I need you to log in the machine.\n\n424\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.640\nAnd I gave you a generic password,\nI need you to change it.\n\n425\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.620\nSo it's unique to Dan because\nadministrators, we don't need passwords.\n\n426\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.056\nWe can always reset them, all right?\n\n427\n00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.750\nBut there's couple of options that\nwe can do, we could uncheck this.\n\n428\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.190\nAnd if I wanted I could say,\nuser can't change the password.\n\n429\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.458\nThat's not a very good security technique,\nas we'll learn a little bit later.\n\n430\n00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:18.758\nI could say password never expires,\nagain not very good for\n\n431\n00:21:18.758 --> 00:21:20.990\nsecurity purposes implementation.\n\n432\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.960\nOr I could just say\nthe account is disabled.\n\n433\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.600\nNow that's a good thing if\nyou have somebody, Danny,\n\n434\n00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.890\nI think you mentioned that earlier,\nwhere if somebody does leave the company,\n\n435\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.190\nyou don't want them to be able to\nlog in to the machine anymore.\n\n436\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.500\nThey don't work with us anymore, right?\n\n437\n00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.130\nSo we can disable the account but\nas an administrator Dan or\n\n438\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.530\nI could log back into this machine,\nenable the account.\n\n439\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.893\nAnd then we could take\ncontrol over the account and\n\n440\n00:21:40.893 --> 00:21:43.818\ngain access to any of the documents\nthat might be left behind,\n\n441\n00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:46.586\nthat we need to gain access to for\nour corporate purposes.\n\n442\n00:21:46.586 --> 00:21:50.027\nBut let me go ahead, and\nI'll right-click again, and again,\n\n443\n00:21:50.027 --> 00:21:52.720\nwe'll try to keep the silent\nJ out of Dan's name.\n\n444\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.950\nAnd we'll go ahead,\nwe'll type our super secret password here.\n\n445\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.590\nAnd we will choose Create.\n\n446\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.510\nNow, one of the great things you'll see,\nis that wow,\n\n447\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.510\nthat looked like it did\nabsolutely nothing.\n\n448\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.660\n&gt;&gt; It cleared the screen.\n\n449\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.970\nIt cleared out the fields, right?\n\n450\n00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:06.790\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n451\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.530\nSo what did it do?\n\n452\n00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:12.300\nWell, they do realize you might,\nif you're first doing post installation\n\n453\n00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.090\nconfiguration, you might have a series\nof users that you wanna create, right?\n\n454\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.240\nSo it just keeps it open.\n\n455\n00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.850\nBut if we close it down, you'll see in the\nbackground that there is Dan's account.\n\n456\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.580\nAnd I do have the ability that I can reset\na password if I want, Set Password, so\n\n457\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.440\na couple of different ways.\n\n458\n00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.810\nThat's a little redundant, right?\n\n459\n00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.820\nI could delete the account.\n\n460\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.490\nBe careful deleting user accounts.\n\n461\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.020\nThat's not necessarily\nsomething you wanna do.\n\n462\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.730\nAnd I can also look at\nthe Properties of Dan's account.\n\n463\n00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.000\nIn this case, I could find out\nwhat group is Dan a member of?\n\n464\n00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.645\nWell at this point, it should be at\nleast a member of the Users group,\n\n465\n00:22:43.645 --> 00:22:45.070\nwell it's a user I just created.\n\n466\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.420\nIn this case you'll also see HomeUsers.\n\n467\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.596\nNow, that leads me to the next portion,\nright?\n\n468\n00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:54.380\nThe other side of the tracks when\nit comes to Local Users and Groups.\n\n469\n00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.560\nIt also gives you the ability\nto create groups.\n\n470\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.100\nNow I want you to be careful with\nthis one because on the exam,\n\n471\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.950\nthey might throw you some\nkind of trick question.\n\n472\n00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.810\nAnd that trick question might be,\nwhere do you create groups?\n\n473\n00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.170\nThat would be easy to remember,\nlocal users in groups.\n\n474\n00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.600\nBut if you'll notice,\nI right-click on our Start icon here and\n\n475\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.300\nI choose Control Panel.\n\n476\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.340\nIf I go up to User Accounts and\nFamily Safety your first guess might be,\n\n477\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.815\nhey I create a group right here.\n\n478\n00:23:17.815 --> 00:23:22.640\nBut if we go into User Accounts and Family\nSafety and then we go to to User Accounts,\n\n479\n00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.690\none of the things I want you to\nnotice that isn't in this lists,\n\n480\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.260\ncreating groups, right?\n\n481\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.450\nI can choose manage another account,\nyou'll see the account, there's Dan,\n\n482\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.940\nthere's account that we just created.\n\n483\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.343\nNotice I can add a new user to the PC, I\ncould do a lot of the same things, right?\n\n484\n00:23:38.343 --> 00:23:45.810\nIn this case, we're doing it through\nthe monitored UI versus the desktop there.\n\n485\n00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.940\nBut one of the things that I don't get\nthe ability to do is create a group.\n\n486\n00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.111\nAnd I bring that up just as an exam alert,\nright?\n\n487\n00:23:52.111 --> 00:23:55.627\nSo if you're gonna create\na group with inside of Windows,\n\n488\n00:23:55.627 --> 00:24:00.526\nyou have to do it from the administrative\nutility known as Computer Management.\n\n489\n00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:03.272\nSo let me go ahead and close this down And\n\n490\n00:24:03.272 --> 00:24:07.610\nwe will get back to computer\nmanagement and continue on here.\n\n491\n00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.910\nAll right Dan, I know that we're gonna\nprobably have to wrap this one up soon,\n\n492\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.942\nbut I do have one other one that\nI wanna kind of talk about.\n\n493\n00:24:15.942 --> 00:24:19.760\nLet's see, which one can we talk about\nhere with the time that we have left?\n\n494\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.260\nOkay, let me just briefly\ntalk about Task Scheduler.\n\n495\n00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.910\nI'm gonna jump around here because\nwe've got a couple of them and\n\n496\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.380\nI don't know that I have time to fit\nthem in here in the last few minutes.\n\n497\n00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.730\nSo we'll talk about task scheduler.\n\n498\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.400\nNow, great thing about Task Scheduler,\nit allows you to automate\n\n499\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.730\na lot of the daily activities that you\nwould perform on a machine, all right?\n\n500\n00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.900\nAnd there are some that\nare already automated.\n\n501\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.480\nIn fact, if we look at Task Scheduler, and\n\n502\n00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.710\nI believe if we get down into\nthe Task Scheduler library, open this up.\n\n503\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.760\nMicrosoft, Windows, and\nI wanna say Defrag should be in the list.\n\n504\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.300\nYeah, there it is.\n\n505\n00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.310\nDefrag.\n\n506\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.772\nAll right.\nSince the days of Vista,\n\n507\n00:24:54.772 --> 00:24:59.550\ndisk defragmentation\nhappens automatically and\n\n508\n00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:05.410\nthat's because they have scheduled a task\nin the background that says ready and\n\n509\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:10.450\nrun our, basically optimize\nyour storage and do it for you.\n\n510\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.134\nAll right, some people would go\nthrough in the days of XP and\n\n511\n00:25:13.134 --> 00:25:16.786\nthey'd never run this one time and wonder\nwhy they get performance issues when it\n\n512\n00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:18.520\ncomes to the hard drives themselves.\n\n513\n00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.240\nSo some things are done automatically.\n\n514\n00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.980\nSome tasks are already scheduled out to\nrun, but you could also run your own.\n\n515\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.070\nYou could also create your own tasks,\nright?\n\n516\n00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.090\nOne of the things that I like\nto use is I used to Media Center\n\n517\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.740\non my home network and I had a certain\ntime that I wanted Media Center\n\n518\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:42.310\nto basically turn on and record a movie.\n\n519\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.960\nBut because I had a 1500\nwatt power supply,\n\n520\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.300\nI didn't wanna leave that\nmachine on all the time, right?\n\n521\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.401\nMy power company would, but-\n&gt;&gt; They would love that.\n\n522\n00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:50.493\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely love it.\n\n523\n00:25:50.493 --> 00:25:53.644\nSo what I would do is-\n&gt;&gt; Or you'd get raided by vice cops or\n\n524\n00:25:53.644 --> 00:25:54.575\nsomething.\n\n525\n00:25:54.575 --> 00:25:56.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n526\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.290\nSo what I would do is I had a little\napplication that would use a little\n\n527\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.090\nprotocol called Wake-On-LAN,\n\n528\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.470\nwhich would send the communication over\nthe network and wake the computer up.\n\n529\n00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.100\nWell, I task scheduled it\nfrom another computer.\n\n530\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.849\nAnd I said, hey, run this application and\npoint it over to the big machine at\n\n531\n00:26:11.849 --> 00:26:15.539\na certain time to wake the computer up and\nthen once the computer's awake,\n\n532\n00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:19.249\nMedia Center picks up at that time and\nthat's already scheduled, right?\n\n533\n00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:23.060\nSo you can automate a lot of\nthe daily tasks that you can do.\n\n534\n00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.010\nIt's one of the great things\nabout Task Scheduler.\n\n535\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.070\nAnd like I said, you can manually create\nthese, but as you can see, like, for\n\n536\n00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.150\ninstance, the Disk Defragmenter\nalready has this ready to go for use.\n\n537\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.130\nSome of them are already there, some of\nthem are there but they aren't turned on.\n\n538\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.217\nAnd all you really have to do is go ahead\nand turn them on or enable them and\n\n539\n00:26:40.217 --> 00:26:45.010\nit allows you the ability to just, so that\nyou don't have to do a hands on approach.\n\n540\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.980\nThat's what we call a least amount\nadministrative effort, right?\n\n541\n00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.395\nSomething that reduces the complexities\nof our day to day operations and\n\n542\n00:26:51.395 --> 00:26:55.670\nTask Scheduler Is one of the great\nadministrative utilities that we have\n\n543\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:56.800\ninside of command prompt.\n\n544\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.600\nBut our command prompt,\nhow about computer management?\n\n545\n00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.509\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that is,\n\n546\n00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:02.616\nwe got a lot more to go but\nDan's looking at me and\n\n547\n00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:06.070\nI don't know if we have enough time in\nthis episode to take care of all of them.\n\n548\n00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not a problem, right?\n\n549\n00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.990\nAs we always do when we run\nout of time in an episode and\n\n550\n00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:14.280\nwe have a multitudinous of topics for\nus to cover.\n\n551\n00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.060\nWe just roll right into that part two,\nthree, four, nine, twelve, and so\n\n552\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.630\non and so forth.\n\n553\n00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.400\n[LAUGH] Hopefully,\nit won't be that many, right?\n\n554\n00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.770\nHopefully, it's just a few.\n\n555\n00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.290\nBut Wes is right.\n\n556\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.400\nWe are out of time for this episode.\n\n557\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.210\nWe do thank you good folks for watching.\n\n558\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.385\nAgain, as always, we hope that\nyou're getting a lot out of this.\n\n559\n00:27:29.385 --> 00:27:33.081\nAs our goal in life is to take the\nknowledge inside of these two heads right\n\n560\n00:27:33.081 --> 00:27:36.305\nhere and then plant them into yours,\nA plus knowledge that is.\n\n561\n00:27:36.305 --> 00:27:40.410\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode for ITProTV.\n\n562\n00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.588\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n563\n00:27:41.588 --> 00:27:42.526\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n564\n00:27:42.526 --> 00:27:45.052\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:27:45.052 --> 00:27:50.731\n[MUSIC]\n\n566\n00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:53.741\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.925\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:07.986\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:11.647\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:13.497\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:17.046\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.630\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.098\nAnd in today's episode it is\nmore in our A+ series for\n\n10\n00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:27.819\nspecifically the software version of that\nExam the 22902, if memory does serve.\n\n11\n00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.623\nAnd joining me back in the studio yet\nagain lending his expertise, yet\n\n12\n00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:33.330\nagain on that very topic.\n\n13\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.259\nAll good for Mr. Weiss Brian Weiss,\nwelcome back sir how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:37.449\n&gt;&gt; It's going great man.\n\n15\n00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.153\nYou're memory is as impeccable as your\ntiming, so you did a great job there.\n\n16\n00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:42.933\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n17\n00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.585\nwe are moving on in our Windows tools.\n\n18\n00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:48.913\nAnd in our last part, we talked a little\nbit about some of the administrative\n\n19\n00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:50.270\ntools, how you can find them.\n\n20\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.979\nWe talked about computer management.\n\n21\n00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.663\nWe also talked about a couple of these\nadministrative tools that you find in\n\n22\n00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:59.243\nAdministrative Tools, but\nyou'll also find in Computer Management.\n\n23\n00:00:59.243 --> 00:01:02.155\nSo what we're gonna go ahead do is\nwe're gonna move down our list in\n\n24\n00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:05.346\nAdministrative Tools here, and\nwe're gonna really just continue on.\n\n25\n00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:08.179\nSo let's go ahead,\nI've got my Windows 7 machine here.\n\n26\n00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:11.890\nAnd as a recap,\nremember to get to administrative tools.\n\n27\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.507\nWe're just gonna push the start button.\n\n28\n00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:18.615\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel, inside\nof Control Panel System and Security.\n\n29\n00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:24.260\nAnd then you can see here, yes, last but\nnot the least is Administrative Tools.\n\n30\n00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.330\nAll right, so working down the list\nhere one of the ones that we\n\n31\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.850\ndidn't talk about in the last episode was,\nwell, this one right here.\n\n32\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.022\nThis one known as\nthe Local Security Policy.\n\n33\n00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:37.073\nNow when we look at\nthe Local Security Policy,\n\n34\n00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:42.002\nreally what this is this is a subset of\nsecurity settings that we can enforce\n\n35\n00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:45.621\non basically controlling\nthe computer environment.\n\n36\n00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:50.010\nWe can control things like, for\ninstance password policies if you will.\n\n37\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.935\nNow, if you are in a corporate\nenvironment, all right.\n\n38\n00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:57.595\nA lot of times these settings are gonna be\ncontrolled by another computer separately\n\n39\n00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:58.300\nout there.\n\n40\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.284\nOne that controls really the entire\ncorporate environment, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:03.783\nIt's something known as a domain control.\n\n42\n00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:05.569\nOr it's a server, and\nit provides a service.\n\n43\n00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.509\nAnd a lot of times it's going\nto configure these settings for\n\n44\n00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.752\nyou because the administrators\nare gonna configure that for you.\n\n45\n00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:15.940\nBut you can also do so\nmany settings locally.\n\n46\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.971\nAnd you might be in a situation where\nmaybe you're running a Microsoft\n\n47\n00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.521\nworkgroup or a Windows workgroup.\n\n48\n00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.530\nAnd again that's a decentralized model.\n\n49\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.608\nIt's not gonna be controlled by that big\ncomputer out there called the server.\n\n50\n00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:31.471\nSo in that case you would have\nthe ability to manage these settings.\n\n51\n00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:35.546\nNow in a work group environment keep in\nmind if you are using security policy,\n\n52\n00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:40.260\nlocal security policy, there is a reason\nthey call it local security policy.\n\n53\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.116\nIt is only defining the settings on\nthat specific machine, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:50.175\nIf I have five Windows Machines within\na small office, home office if you will,\n\n55\n00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:55.028\nor a workgroup, that means if I want\nto replicate it, if I wanna duplicate.\n\n56\n00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:59.276\nIf you will these settings, I have to go\nto every individual computer and make sure\n\n57\n00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:03.850\nthat I configure these identically across\nall the different local security policies.\n\n58\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.492\nThat's one of the great things\nabout using a server in a corporate\n\n59\n00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.461\nenvironment, right.\n\n60\n00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:12.380\nWe can set that policy in one location,\non that one computer.\n\n61\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.383\nAnd then what it does is it sends out\nthe settings to every computer within that\n\n62\n00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:17.501\ncorporate network.\n\n63\n00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:23.440\nSo do you understand that, that's why\nthey call it a local security policy.\n\n64\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.092\nAnd again you could see some other\nthings like we could do, right?\n\n65\n00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:27.772\nI could set up password policy, right.\n\n66\n00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:32.045\nAnd inside of here if I wanted to set a\npassword policy I could do something like\n\n67\n00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:36.480\nfor instance saying hey, I wanna go ahead\nand I wanna set the password history.\n\n68\n00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.530\nHow many unique passwords do you have\nto cycle through before you can reuse\n\n69\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.976\nan old password, right?\n\n70\n00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:44.170\nI might say eight passwords, right.\n\n71\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.750\nLet's say your favorite password is,\nI don't know capital P @ symbol ssword.\n\n72\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.504\nWell, how many unique passwords do you\nhave to go through before you can reuse\n\n73\n00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:54.330\nthat password?\n\n74\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.817\nAnd that's usually coupled with\nthe maximum password age, right?\n\n75\n00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:02.260\nHow long does a password last\nbefore we have to change it?\n\n76\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.560\nSo again, and we'll talk about it in\nour security section, here in the 902.\n\n77\n00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.634\nWe'll talk a lot more about password\npolicy, I just want you to see that these\n\n78\n00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:11.781\nare some of the settings\nthat you can configure here.\n\n79\n00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:15.121\nWe can do a lot of other things,\nlike count lockout policies, right.\n\n80\n00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:19.005\nWe can say okay,\nI wanna prevent a guessing attack, and\n\n81\n00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:21.910\nI want Dan to be able\nto sit at my computer.\n\n82\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.870\nI'm gonna blame the blackout\non I'm Dan today.\n\n83\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.813\nI want Dan to be able to sit at my\ncomputer and be able to type in ten times\n\n84\n00:04:28.813 --> 00:04:33.184\nbefore he realizes that my\npassword is I love my cat, right.\n\n85\n00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:36.775\nSo I'm gonna lock him out after three,\nfour, five attempts, you gotta be careful.\n\n86\n00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.904\nYou mentioned a good thing in\none of the other episodes,\n\n87\n00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.408\nthe more secure you get a lot of\ntimes the less convenient you get.\n\n88\n00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:45.043\nSo let's be careful with these settings\ncuz you can inadvertently lock yourself\n\n89\n00:04:45.043 --> 00:04:46.330\ndown of a lot of things here.\n\n90\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.478\nBut we can do other things too like\nmanaging things like Windows Firewall\n\n91\n00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:51.028\nas well.\n\n92\n00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:53.914\nSo you could see some of the local\nsecurity settings if you will,\n\n93\n00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:54.880\nthat we can enforce.\n\n94\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.706\nAnd that means that if we set them here,\nwhoever logs on to this machine,\n\n95\n00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:01.920\nguess what, they're gonna\nhave these settings enforced.\n\n96\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.837\nSo that is your local security policy but\nthat's not everything that we have, right.\n\n97\n00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:08.103\nAnd I keep closing that down.\n\n98\n00:05:08.103 --> 00:05:10.690\nLet's try to keep that\nopen a little bit longer.\n\n99\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.380\nWell you're gonna see by the end of this\n\n100\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.780\nepisode you should know exactly how\nto get to Administrative Tools.\n\n101\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.939\nAnd the next one they have is what\nis known as the performance monitor,\n\n102\n00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:22.484\nall right.\n\n103\n00:05:22.484 --> 00:05:25.254\nInside of Windows,\nyou have what's known as,\n\n104\n00:05:25.254 --> 00:05:29.290\nsometimes also abbreviated Perf Mon,\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n105\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.463\nNow Performance Monitor is a great\nutility and the fact that it allows\n\n106\n00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:39.381\nyou to measure performance related,\nif you will calculations.\n\n107\n00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:43.823\nIf I wanna figure out, you know Dan I've\nbeen noticing that the performance on this\n\n108\n00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:46.311\ncomputer it hasn't been that great, right.\n\n109\n00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:49.690\nWell our first thought is well\nit's gotta be a virus, right.\n\n110\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.939\nIt's not always a virus, right.\n\n111\n00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.731\nDoesn't necessarily\nmean that it's malware.\n\n112\n00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.400\nCould be the fact that a hard\ndrive's failing, or a CPU's failing.\n\n113\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.340\nSo we need some kind of avenue\nin which we can diagnose that\n\n114\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.740\nkind of functionality, right.\n\n115\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta, the performance\nmonitor another one of those\n\n116\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.970\nthe big tools that you're gonna dive\ninto use on a daily basis to check.\n\n117\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.163\nCuz you will get users that\nwill call you up and say,\n\n118\n00:06:09.163 --> 00:06:11.117\nmy computer seems to be\nrunning very slowly.\n\n119\n00:06:11.117 --> 00:06:14.571\nI click on something, and ten seconds\nlater what I clicked finally does\n\n120\n00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.060\nthe action, and okay,\nwell, let's take a look.\n\n121\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.410\nThere's definitely an indication\nthat something is hogging CPU or\n\n122\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.240\nmemory has been just completely utilized\nand maybe the hard drive is filled up.\n\n123\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.828\nSomething that performance monitor\ncan kinda help us find out\n\n124\n00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:32.833\nwhere the problem is coming from.\n\n125\n00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:33.869\n&gt;&gt; And you know what, let's go ahead.\n\n126\n00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:38.180\nLet's expand on his example, and\nsay hey, maybe we think it's the CPU.\n\n127\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.698\nMaybe we think it's the hard drive.\n\n128\n00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:42.613\nWell what can we do with performance\nmonitor in order to see that?\n\n129\n00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:44.449\nWell the first thing that we can do, and\n\n130\n00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.411\nremember this is another one of\nthose that context is key here.\n\n131\n00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:51.461\nBecause notice I don't see anything on\nhere in the context page until I actually\n\n132\n00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:53.170\nclick Performance Monitor.\n\n133\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.310\nNow, Performance Monitor is a real time\n\n134\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.620\ngraph here that we can see when\nwe click Performance Monitor.\n\n135\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.560\nAnd one of the things I can see is that\nwe've got a little bit of statistical\n\n136\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.750\ninformation in kind of\na graph type format.\n\n137\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.510\nNow you could change\nthis view if you want.\n\n138\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.220\nYou've got some options here, some\naction options across the top here, and\n\n139\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.659\nthe different action icons.\n\n140\n00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.380\nSo for instance,\nmaybe I don't like the graph.\n\n141\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.745\nMaybe I say, you know what,\nI wanna see more of a histogram type bar.\n\n142\n00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:23.363\nYes, well I can change it, right.\n\n143\n00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:26.283\nAnd maybe that makes a little\nbit more sense to you.\n\n144\n00:07:26.283 --> 00:07:28.499\nMe, personally,\nI actually kinda like the line graph,\n\n145\n00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.311\nor maybe I just wanna see the raw data,\nright.\n\n146\n00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:33.556\nMaybe Dan calls me up and says hey Wes,\nI need you to go to client 01 and\n\n147\n00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:37.530\nfigure out what is the current processor\ntime utilization on that machine.\n\n148\n00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.569\nI need a report on it.\n\n149\n00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:40.818\nWell, I wouldn't really\nbe able to help him.\n\n150\n00:07:40.818 --> 00:07:43.098\nI'd say okay, it's, no it's not.\n\n151\n00:07:43.098 --> 00:07:43.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:44.471\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No it's not, right?\n\n153\n00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:46.979\nSo what I can do,\nis I can go to report, right.\n\n154\n00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.398\nAnd I can take kind of like a snapshot\nof what it was at this time.\n\n155\n00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:53.675\nAnd I can send that information over here.\n\n156\n00:07:53.675 --> 00:07:56.357\nAnd I can give him a little something\na little bit more tangible to look at.\n\n157\n00:07:56.357 --> 00:08:00.292\nRight, but that isn't the only\nthing that you can do, right?\n\n158\n00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:02.870\nWhen we talked about CPU,\nthere's other things within the CPU.\n\n159\n00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.280\nNow notice down here at the bottom, we've\ngot his term counter, what's that mean.\n\n160\n00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.070\nWell, a counter is an individual attribute\n\n161\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.510\nof whatever the device it is that\nyou are trying to monitor, right?\n\n162\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.900\nDan mentioned CPU, right?\n\n163\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.770\nSo processor time, percent processor time.\n\n164\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.450\nHow much time are we\nutilizing the processor?\n\n165\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.760\nBut maybe I wanna find out more\ninformation about the processor.\n\n166\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.520\nMaybe I wanna find another attribute.\n\n167\n00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.080\nSo what do I do?\n\n168\n00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.010\nI add a counter.\n\n169\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.940\nRight?\nI can add additional attributes.\n\n170\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.690\nAnd I can, again a counter is again a way\nto measure counts, the performance.\n\n171\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.980\nSo If I go up here to the top,\nyou'll see this little plus button, right?\n\n172\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.480\nAnd I can add a counter.\n\n173\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.160\nAnd when I add as a counter, a lot of\ntimes, I like keyboard shortcuts, too,\n\n174\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.915\njust because I've got them\nmemorized over the years.\n\n175\n00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:51.668\nCtrl+N brings up this display, too.\n\n176\n00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:54.920\nBut notice,\nhere we've got some categories.\n\n177\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.170\nThese are the different components and\ncategories, if you will,\n\n178\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.650\nof components that we can monitor.\n\n179\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.840\nThere are all different kinds.\n\n180\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.980\nRight, now, inside the CPU, processor and\nCPU again, interchangeable terms, right?\n\n181\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.380\nSo, I can actually\nexpand out processor and\n\n182\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.860\nI can see that there is a whole bunch of\ndifferent things that we can look at.\n\n183\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.660\nI can look at CPU interrupts,\ninterrupts per second.\n\n184\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.615\nMaybe that's important to me, right?\n\n185\n00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:23.990\nMaybe I can look at things like processor\nperformance, right, when I scroll down and\n\n186\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.910\nI can see what's the maximum\nfrequency of this process running at?\n\n187\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.430\nWell, if I double click this,\n\n188\n00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.580\nand what I can do is I can come down\nhere to the bottom and I can choose Add.\n\n189\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:39.010\nIf I want to, and when I choose Add,\nnotice that we've got this two pane view.\n\n190\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.170\nAvailable counters, these are the\nattributes that you want to measure\n\n191\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.570\nversus the counters that you've\nactually added To the list right?\n\n192\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.220\nAnd then once we've added that, we could\nturn around and we could choose OK.\n\n193\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.360\nAnd when we choose OK, over time\n\n194\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.630\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna\nreally see a lot of the information, but\n\n195\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.110\nwhat we should end up seeing is that\nwe get additional information here.\n\n196\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.280\nNow, what information you get is\nreally contingent on the counters\n\n197\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.410\nthat you're actually adding so.\n\n198\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.710\nLet's say that,\nmaybe I wanted to figure out,\n\n199\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.260\nokay, a little bit more\nabout maybe the Memory.\n\n200\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.240\nSo they're alphabetical here, and if I can\nremember my alphabet, I can find Memory.\n\n201\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.770\nAnd okay, let's kinda zoom in,\nlet you guys and\n\n202\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.920\ngals out there see it without\nneeding a magnifying glass.\n\n203\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.360\nAll right,\nI can expand the memory category right?\n\n204\n00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.560\nMaybe I wanna find out well how's\nthe memory working right now, right?\n\n205\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.620\nDirectly proportional to the hard\ndrive and the memory is paging, right?\n\n206\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.130\nIf I have memory is being\nutilized to it's full capacity,\n\n207\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.340\nthe operating system does\nthis very very cool thing.\n\n208\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.770\nA lot of operating systems do this where\nthey can actually take information on\n\n209\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.110\na RAM that isn't currently being used and\nwrite it to the hard drive, right?\n\n210\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.440\nIt's called paging.\n\n211\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.040\nWell, that means that if I don't have\nenough memory in my computer and\n\n212\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.620\nRAM is being utilized too much, I might\nsee an increase in the pages per second.\n\n213\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.090\nWell I can add that.\n\n214\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.400\nSo, I can select that counter.\n\n215\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.940\nAnd I can choose OK.\n\n216\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.510\nAnd eventually what we'll get\nis additional information.\n\n217\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.740\nAnd it's interesting, because it\ndoesn't look like it's refreshing here.\n\n218\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.120\nLet me see if I can do that.\n\n219\n00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.180\nOne more time.\n\n220\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.540\nI've added a couple of those.\n\n221\n00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.580\nAnd that might just be\na refresh on my part.\n\n222\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.820\nBut, let's try that one more time,\nwe'll add a couple of them here.\n\n223\n00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.570\nWe'll add, I tell you what, let's add\nAvailable Megabytes, we'll choose OK.\n\n224\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.290\nLet's choose, and\nI might've hit, you know what?\n\n225\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.080\nActually it might have been\nuser error on that one Dan.\n\n226\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.830\nI might've said Cancel.\n\n227\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.820\nAll right and I'll choose OK, there we go.\n\n228\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.230\nYeah, it helps if you actually hit OK,\nand not Cancel.\n\n229\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.150\nSo got to use your utility right.\n\n230\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.850\nI swear I meant to do that, I was testing\nyou guys and gals out there, okay?\n\n231\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.650\nSo notice that what we\nhave is some additional\n\n232\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.070\ncounters that show up in the list.\n\n233\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.180\nThese are those additional attributes\nthat we are going to monitor.\n\n234\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.780\nNow, notice that I have an additional\nkind of line graph going on here, right?\n\n235\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.310\nWell, sometimes you can get\na lot of information here.\n\n236\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.440\nThat's why you gotta be very specific,\nright.\n\n237\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.710\nDon't add everything.\n\n238\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.150\nWe've already mentioned that when\nwere talking about another episode.\n\n239\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.260\nWe said, watch with auditing\neverything because in auditing\n\n240\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.268\neverything you might not\nbe able to find anything.\n\n241\n00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:19.680\nWell, this can start to\nlook like a road map to,\n\n242\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.500\nI don't know, downtown New York if\nyou add too many of those counters.\n\n243\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:28.040\nBut the great thing is, maybe I do\nwanna figure out okay, which one.\n\n244\n00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.210\nI can't tell, which one's memory, right?\n\n245\n00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.490\nWell, I can see that it\nis pages per second, but\n\n246\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.330\nI'm not sure within the list of all\nthese counters which one it is.\n\n247\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.250\nWell, they do have the ability,\nit's color-coded.\n\n248\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.460\nBut you can see that the red here, those\nare kinda really, really close, right?\n\n249\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.940\n&gt;&gt; Is it red and orange?\n\n250\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.420\nI think it might be red and orange.\n\n251\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.230\n&gt;&gt; Red and orange, right?\n\n252\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.340\nWell, here's the great thing about that.\n\n253\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.430\nNotice that I can select\nthe counter down there.\n\n254\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.180\nAnd what I could do is I could\ncome up to this highlight button.\n\n255\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.870\nAnd when I click it,\nwe'll see if Dan was right.\n\n256\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.220\nAll right?\n\n257\n00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.230\nAnd you know what's interesting.\n\n258\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.380\nI'm not really worried about it.\n\n259\n00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.090\nI don't see any information there.\n\n260\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:11.300\nAnd let see if that is, you know what,\nthat was one's actually up at the top.\n\n261\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.220\n&gt;&gt; See here, see there.\n\n262\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.720\n&gt;&gt; It's pegged out.\n\n263\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.320\n&gt;&gt; And I wouldn't have known.\n\n264\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.380\nIt's all the way at the top.\n\n265\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.470\nAnd if I hover to discover.\n\n266\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.340\nRemember we talked-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n267\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.030\n&gt;&gt; About that a lot, there's that counter.\n\n268\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.390\nAnd I wouldn't have known that.\n\n269\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.560\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.490\nI wish I could tell you I meant to\ndo that, but I did not, right, but\n\n271\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.670\nthat's the great thing about it.\n\n272\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.680\nThere it is tucked away,\nthere at the top and\n\n273\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.370\nneither Dan or I seen that until\nwe hit the highlighter button.\n\n274\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.790\nAnd then we could say you know what,\nif I click on that or\n\n275\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.750\nI kinda hover over that counter there,\nsure enough it let's me know,\n\n276\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.270\nwell there's the value,\nthere's the time, and there's the date.\n\n277\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.580\nSo that's a great thing about performance\nmonitor, but I want you to notice\n\n278\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.960\nsomething here and I'm going to do this\non purpose that was actually on purpose.\n\n279\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.310\nI'm going to close it down and\nI'm going to launch it again.\n\n280\n00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.305\nOr, rename it.\n\n281\n00:13:57.305 --> 00:13:58.442\n&gt;&gt; We'll rename it.\n\n282\n00:13:58.442 --> 00:14:01.570\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhen I launch it again wait a second.\n\n283\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.270\nDarn it, we started over.\n\n284\n00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.280\nAll right, that really isn't good.\n\n285\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.370\nDan says, I need you to monitor\nthe same thing Wes, what's going on?\n\n286\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.170\nWell I said it but\nI forgot, which one is it?\n\n287\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.650\nWell Dan doesn't want\nto get a call again and\n\n288\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.320\nsay, hey we've already had this\nconversation, write it down.\n\n289\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.810\nWell I wrote it down and\nit keeps getting erased.\n\n290\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.170\nWell that's where something known as data\ncollector sets come in, all right, you\n\n291\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.820\nmight hear them in documentation if you're\nout there researching this cold DCS.\n\n292\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.370\nWell imagine that I already know what the\nattributes are that I want to monitor and\n\n293\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.110\nI want to monitor them on a regular basis.\n\n294\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.950\nWell I can actually group them together\nand save them to the hard drive and\n\n295\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.090\nI can run them at will when I need to.\n\n296\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.940\nBut I have to create what's\nknown as a Data Collector Set.\n\n297\n00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.900\nI will tell you if you look at\nthe System node there are some that\n\n298\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.320\nare already defined for us.\n\n299\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.740\nI can run a System Diagnostic and\n\n300\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.460\nlook at all these different counters and\ntests that we can run.\n\n301\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.350\nNot everything is necessarily a counter.\n\n302\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.350\nIt could be again, like you can see\nconfiguration, I can see that there is\n\n303\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.730\na Performance Counter here and it does\nlet you know that it is a Counter, right?\n\n304\n00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.900\nHowever, you can also get User Defined.\n\n305\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.410\nIt's nice that you can run a quick one off\nand they've already got them built in.\n\n306\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.640\nBut I can go up here to User Defined,\nright?\n\n307\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.980\nI can select this, I can right-click and\n\n308\n00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.170\nI can choose New Data Collector Set,\nnew DCS.\n\n309\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.690\nThen when I create this,\nI get the ability to name this.\n\n310\n00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:34.397\nSo we could say something like 220-902\n\n311\n00:15:34.397 --> 00:15:39.760\nA+ Demo and\nI could work from a template now.\n\n312\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.280\nTemplates again, just like any template,\nit gives you a ballpark configuration.\n\n313\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.140\nLet's not do that.\n\n314\n00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.260\nLet's be a little bit\nrisque here if you will.\n\n315\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.624\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's create one manually.\n\n316\n00:15:52.624 --> 00:15:55.947\nNow you're gonna have to do a little\nbit more configuration on this but\n\n317\n00:15:55.947 --> 00:15:58.986\nyou can also get very granular on\nwhat you do So we'll go ahead and\n\n318\n00:15:58.986 --> 00:16:02.000\nchoose Next and notice I have\nsome different options, right?\n\n319\n00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.077\nSystem configuration information,\nEvent trace data, right?\n\n320\n00:16:07.077 --> 00:16:10.811\nKinda like some of the information\nthat we see inside of event viewer or\n\n321\n00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:13.166\nI can go with performance counter, right?\n\n322\n00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:15.251\nAnd the other thing is to,\nyou can also create alerts.\n\n323\n00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:16.583\nThis is great, right.\n\n324\n00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:20.090\nThe answers I already know there's\nsomething wrong, I want an email.\n\n325\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.490\nI wanna be aware of it visually\nwhen it hits this threshold.\n\n326\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.026\nWell, that's the good\nthing about an alert.\n\n327\n00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:29.285\nBut let's go ahead and let's say, we're\njust gonna use a performance counter, and\n\n328\n00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:30.787\nwe're gonna choose Next, all right.\n\n329\n00:16:30.787 --> 00:16:34.634\nNow at this point we can say how long do\nwe want to sample, as of the interval,\n\n330\n00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:36.453\nhow long do we want to monitor this?\n\n331\n00:16:36.453 --> 00:16:39.453\nAnd we'll just I tell you what,\nI'm gonna, just for\n\n332\n00:16:39.453 --> 00:16:43.780\nthe purposes of our test,\nI'm gonna bring this down to two seconds.\n\n333\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.530\nAgain, remember that's the beauty\nof being able to create a DCS,\n\n334\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.470\nyou can customize it.\n\n335\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.657\nWhen I choose Add, it brings up the same\nlist that we've just seen, all right.\n\n336\n00:16:51.657 --> 00:16:56.272\nAnd I can add things like for instance\nprocessor time, it's one of those ones\n\n337\n00:16:56.272 --> 00:17:00.532\nthat's kinda already there when you\nopen up you performance counter or\n\n338\n00:17:00.532 --> 00:17:01.955\nperformance monitor.\n\n339\n00:17:01.955 --> 00:17:06.190\nBut then we could get up here and we could\ndo other things to, like for instance.\n\n340\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.933\nSo, what's another\ncommon that we might do?\n\n341\n00:17:08.933 --> 00:17:12.638\nMaybe we do,\nlet me look through this list here, and\n\n342\n00:17:12.638 --> 00:17:16.020\nsee maybe some of the ones\nthat I might wanna do.\n\n343\n00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.272\nOkay, maybe we'll do memory, right.\n\n344\n00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:22.862\nAnd what I wanna know,\nis I wanna know pages per second, right?\n\n345\n00:17:22.862 --> 00:17:27.277\nI wanna find out is my memory\ngetting overloaded by this machine?\n\n346\n00:17:27.277 --> 00:17:30.901\nMaybe there might be telltale signs that\nI need to upgrade or expand the memory.\n\n347\n00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.797\nMemory, memory is your\ntemporary workbench.\n\n348\n00:17:32.797 --> 00:17:36.483\nAnd you can only do is work\nwith as many applications\n\n349\n00:17:36.483 --> 00:17:39.494\nas big as that workbench is that you have.\n\n350\n00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:42.955\nWell, if you're constantly writing to the\nhard drive, having to swap information out\n\n351\n00:17:42.955 --> 00:17:45.685\nof the memory and back and forth,\nyou might need to upgrade, right.\n\n352\n00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:46.965\nSo we can add that, right.\n\n353\n00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:49.860\nSo we're starting to get\na little bit of a list here.\n\n354\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.935\nAnd if I kinda scroll down,\nright maybe the network interface.\n\n355\n00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:55.870\nMaybe that's one of\nthe things I wanna know.\n\n356\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.403\nI wanna know what the total\nbytes per second are, right?\n\n357\n00:17:59.403 --> 00:18:01.900\nNow here's something we haven't mentioned,\nright.\n\n358\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.478\nMemory, we're gonna talk about memory,\n\n359\n00:18:04.478 --> 00:18:07.495\nI mean we've got the physical\nRAM on the machine.\n\n360\n00:18:07.495 --> 00:18:10.547\nBut here within my computer,\nI have multiple network adapters, right.\n\n361\n00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.070\nYou could have multiple hard drives.\n\n362\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.288\nAnd if that's the case,\n\n363\n00:18:13.288 --> 00:18:16.659\nnotice you have to pick which of\nthe connections it might be, right.\n\n364\n00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:19.612\nSo I might use\nLocal Area Connection 13 here.\n\n365\n00:18:19.612 --> 00:18:22.090\nAnd I might add that, right.\n\n366\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.458\nAnd now the network interface is\ntelling me how many total bytes are.\n\n367\n00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:30.928\nThen, if I want I can come down here and\nmaybe I want the physical disk, right.\n\n368\n00:18:30.928 --> 00:18:34.386\nI wanna know what's the percent disk time,\nright?\n\n369\n00:18:34.386 --> 00:18:35.316\nThat was the other thing.\n\n370\n00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:36.732\nDid I mention about hard drive?\n\n371\n00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:39.026\nMaybe the hard drive is\nconstantly spinning and\n\n372\n00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:42.360\nI wanna find out what's going on here or\nif that's truly happening.\n\n373\n00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.303\nWell now I have that in the list and we've\ncollected these counters together and\n\n374\n00:18:47.303 --> 00:18:50.055\nI can choose okay, and\nI could choose Next.\n\n375\n00:18:50.055 --> 00:18:51.740\nAnd we can save then,\nand you see the default.\n\n376\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.138\nI wouldn't worry too much about\nthe default on the exam, but\n\n377\n00:18:54.138 --> 00:18:55.462\nyou can see where the default is.\n\n378\n00:18:55.462 --> 00:18:57.190\nWe can choose Next.\n\n379\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:01.320\nAnd we can say, what's the context\nyou want to run this under?\n\n380\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.910\nAnd at this point I can say,\nSave and close, or I could say,\n\n381\n00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.790\nStart this data collector set now.\n\n382\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.155\nNow I'm gonna go ahead, again,\njust for our example purposes here,\n\n383\n00:19:08.155 --> 00:19:09.491\nI'm gonna go ahead and Save and close.\n\n384\n00:19:09.491 --> 00:19:12.913\nCuz I wanna show you how you could\nrun this when you want it, right.\n\n385\n00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:18.157\nI could say, start it now, but let's\ngo ahead and choose Finish, all right.\n\n386\n00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:22.238\nCuz I really wanna show you, that now we\nhave pretty much the same icon, right.\n\n387\n00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:27.270\nWe've got our system defined ones,\nDCS's, and now we have our own.\n\n388\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.043\nAnd if we wanted, we could select that,\nwe could right-click.\n\n389\n00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:33.230\nWe could even save that as your own\ntemplate, import the whole template.\n\n390\n00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.540\nThat's really great, because then I could\ntake this template, and I could import it\n\n391\n00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.990\nto a performance monitor on another\nmachine, in a decentralized environment.\n\n392\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.030\nAs could be very convenient,\n\n393\n00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.537\nactually really in a centralized\nenvironment that's kinda good too.\n\n394\n00:19:45.537 --> 00:19:48.316\nBecause then you could just put\nit up on a file share, somebody\n\n395\n00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:51.691\ncould connect to that share and they\ncould install it on the local machine.\n\n396\n00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.410\nAnd now Don wouldn't have to say hey West,\nhey West, this is what I need you to do.\n\n397\n00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.660\nHey West, this is what I need you to do,\n\n398\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.030\njust download this file,\nrun it, right, and that's great.\n\n399\n00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.650\nSo notice that I wanna right click and\n\n400\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.750\nI choose start,\nI got this little play button here.\n\n401\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.585\nAnd boy isn't that absolutely amazing.\n\n402\n00:20:07.585 --> 00:20:08.865\nWhat is he doing?\n\n403\n00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:10.732\nWell, I don't k now,\nlet's figure that out, right.\n\n404\n00:20:10.732 --> 00:20:13.577\nSo let's go ahead, I'm gonna right click\nit, and let it run for a little bit,\n\n405\n00:20:13.577 --> 00:20:14.370\nlet's choose stop.\n\n406\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.440\nAll right, and\nnow notice that the icon has changed.\n\n407\n00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.828\nSo what did it do?\n\n408\n00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:24.036\nWell, that's where you come\ndown to the next portion here.\n\n409\n00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:26.470\nI want you to notice,\nthat we have this reports.\n\n410\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:31.122\nReports also has two classifications too\nhere, User Defined and has System as well.\n\n411\n00:20:31.122 --> 00:20:34.756\nImagine system is anything we're\nrunning from these two DCS's.\n\n412\n00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:38.252\nUser defined is basically anything\nmatching the name up here\n\n413\n00:20:38.252 --> 00:20:42.770\nof your DCS's that you've created,\nthe manual creation of these.\n\n414\n00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.083\nSo now if I wanna find this out, what\nI'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n415\n00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:47.753\nI'm gonna look under User Defined.\n\n416\n00:20:47.753 --> 00:20:50.406\nAnd I'm gonna see a report,\na log, all right.\n\n417\n00:20:50.406 --> 00:20:55.560\nAnd what I can do is I can actually\nload this up, and here's my information.\n\n418\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.274\nHere's the information that I\ncould now give this report.\n\n419\n00:20:58.274 --> 00:21:01.911\nI could export this report, export\nthis report, that's redundant, right?\n\n420\n00:21:01.911 --> 00:21:03.565\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Dan says, hey,\n\n421\n00:21:03.565 --> 00:21:04.563\nI wanna know what's going on.\n\n422\n00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:08.579\nI can say okay Dan, check your email,\nI sent the report over to you.\n\n423\n00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.156\nGuess what, he can load this\nreport up in a Windows Machine and\n\n424\n00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:12.705\nit does the same kind of diagnostic.\n\n425\n00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:16.590\nAnd what's really cool about this is after\nthe fact he says well I need the raw data.\n\n426\n00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.278\nOkay, change the view, right.\n\n427\n00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:19.987\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n428\n00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:23.000\nall that information is recorded\nwithin inside of that report then?\n\n429\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.555\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, formatting and everything.\n\n430\n00:21:24.555 --> 00:21:25.710\nAnd that's what I really like about it.\n\n431\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.080\nAgain you can use,\nyou even get with a saved report,\n\n432\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.210\nyou get two additional formats.\n\n433\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.661\nYou get area, and\nyou also get stacked area.\n\n434\n00:21:36.661 --> 00:21:38.990\nOkay, so\nvisualization that’s great, right.\n\n435\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:43.623\nSo maybe you're a visual person and the\nfact that you need to, maybe you work for\n\n436\n00:21:43.623 --> 00:21:46.268\na company that you are now\npart of the IT team.\n\n437\n00:21:46.268 --> 00:21:48.986\nAnd you need to give a report to\nthe big wigs that know absolutely\n\n438\n00:21:48.986 --> 00:21:51.270\nnothing about this information, right.\n\n439\n00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.860\nSo you present it to them,\nyou've got a line graph and they say.\n\n440\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.030\nWhat am I looking at here?\n\n441\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.380\nWell, maybe it need a visualization,\nthat's a little bit easier.\n\n442\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.059\nAnd I could say, okay, see this area\naround 11 o'clock just before noon\n\n443\n00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:06.373\nwe're having this kinda peek here.\n\n444\n00:22:06.373 --> 00:22:10.358\nAnd the performance of this computer\nis just really, really going bad.\n\n445\n00:22:10.358 --> 00:22:14.978\nWell now, you might give your the boss,\na reason to say, yeah, wait wait,\n\n446\n00:22:14.978 --> 00:22:18.481\nthat was the hard drive,\nwe need to upgrade the hard drive.\n\n447\n00:22:18.481 --> 00:22:22.541\nSo now we can justify the cost of maybe\nputting in a couple extra hard drives,\n\n448\n00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:27.062\nbuy bigger hard drive, faster hard drive,\nmore memory, whatever the case may be.\n\n449\n00:22:27.062 --> 00:22:31.080\nSo you can diagnose problems with it,\nas well as reviewing and\n\n450\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.104\narchiving this information for\na later date.\n\n451\n00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:35.752\nWell maybe you say, well that's okay.\n\n452\n00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:40.281\nWell what I loved about it is\nI can actually uncheck these.\n\n453\n00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:43.320\nI say well, somebody says,\nmaybe in that presentation,\n\n454\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.995\nwell I only want to know\nwhat the processor time is.\n\n455\n00:22:45.995 --> 00:22:47.262\nI don't need all that other stuff.\n\n456\n00:22:47.262 --> 00:22:49.950\nWell that's okay, uncheck the counter.\n\n457\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.980\nSo it's a great way to\nget a visualization, and\n\n458\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.992\nsave the reports for later.\n\n459\n00:22:53.992 --> 00:22:57.517\nSo know Performance Monitor,\nknow what you would use it for.\n\n460\n00:22:57.517 --> 00:22:58.946\nKnow how to add a counters.\n\n461\n00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:01.236\nKnow that you have DCS's, right.\n\n462\n00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:04.041\nAnd again remember that when\nI choose Performance Monitor,\n\n463\n00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:07.396\nit's a lot like some of the other\nreal-time technologies that we have,\n\n464\n00:23:07.396 --> 00:23:10.269\nbuilt-in diagnostic technologies\nlike Resource Monitor.\n\n465\n00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:14.568\nLike Task Manager that's we'll end\nup talking about coming up as well.\n\n466\n00:23:14.568 --> 00:23:17.480\nBut Performance Monitor\nis a great utility too.\n\n467\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.075\nAll right, then I know that I'm\ngetting close in time here again but\n\n468\n00:23:21.075 --> 00:23:22.695\nI got more then I'll go ahead and mention.\n\n469\n00:23:22.695 --> 00:23:24.675\nAnd we'll try to get\nthis we're in here and\n\n470\n00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:27.488\nit looks like we might have to go\ninto a part three on this one.\n\n471\n00:23:27.488 --> 00:23:32.839\nBut let's go ahead and let's talk just\nbriefly about services, all right.\n\n472\n00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:36.649\nSo we have services and let's define and\nI'll go ahead and launch this up.\n\n473\n00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:40.293\nAnd I'll go ahead and minimize\nadministrative tools for now, all right.\n\n474\n00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:41.285\nWhat is the service?\n\n475\n00:23:41.285 --> 00:23:44.887\nAll right,\nyou have essentially applications or\n\n476\n00:23:44.887 --> 00:23:49.870\nsomething that we as interactive\nusers with machines we want to try.\n\n477\n00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:54.653\nSo for instance if I want to run\ncommand prompt, I initiate it, right?\n\n478\n00:23:54.653 --> 00:24:00.988\nIf I want to run an application such\nas services or such as let's say.\n\n479\n00:24:00.988 --> 00:24:05.226\nComputer management like we the,\nwe talked about briefly as well.\n\n480\n00:24:05.226 --> 00:24:12.590\nI launched that, however, you have\nthings that run in the background.\n\n481\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.900\nThings that we don't necessarily\ninteract with on a daily basis but\n\n482\n00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.280\nare required to move your\noperating system along.\n\n483\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.070\nTo work with the operating system, right?\n\n484\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:25.080\nIn Linux and based systems they have\ndemons, if you will here we have services.\n\n485\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.950\nIt's a background process\nthat's going on that\n\n486\n00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.450\nallows the operating system to function.\n\n487\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.510\nWell how do we see those services?\n\n488\n00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.340\nHow do we interact with those different\n\n489\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.100\nprocesses that are going\non in the background?\n\n490\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.940\nWe do that with a services console found\ninside of the Administrative Tools.\n\n491\n00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.290\nNow some services they run and\nsome services don't run.\n\n492\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.700\nBecause sometimes not every\nservice that is in this list\n\n493\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.230\nis currently being used, right?\n\n494\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.430\nLet me give you just an example without\ngetting too in depth about it, right?\n\n495\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.740\nSo for instance we have something known as\nthe Application Identity service, right?\n\n496\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.060\nAs you go on to learn more about more\ncorporate-based technologies such as and\n\n497\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.880\nEnterprise, there is a way, inside of\nWindows, to lock down the applications\n\n498\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.870\nthat you want running and make sure\nthat only those applications run and\n\n499\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:16.320\nno applications do run by your users,\nsomething called app blocker.\n\n500\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.080\nWell, guess what?\n\n501\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.190\nThe application I got\na disservice is what uses in\n\n502\n00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.750\norder to identify applications\nthat are running.\n\n503\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.030\nHowever, if I double click on Application\nIdentity service, you will notice\n\n504\n00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.040\nthat the status type and will talk about\nthat in a second, it says it's manual.\n\n505\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.850\nBut you will notice that it does say\nthat the Service status is Stopped.\n\n506\n00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.770\nNow I wouldn't know that if I didn't\nhave the services console, right, so\n\n507\n00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.120\nyou could see that not every service\nis running all the time, but\n\n508\n00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.210\nI will tell you that there are services\nthat do run, that are required for\n\n509\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.890\nthe functionality in fact let me go ahead\nand choose the top of the name column here\n\n510\n00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:55.080\nin services and type the letter R and\nI want you to look at this one right here.\n\n511\n00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.120\nNotice this one says\nRemote Procedure Call (RPC).\n\n512\n00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.020\nRPC runs just about every\nsingle background process in\n\n513\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.070\na Windows environment.\n\n514\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.940\nYou can see that it is started.\n\n515\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.400\nAnd if I double-click on it,\nI want you to notice something.\n\n516\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.030\nThat, yes, it's running and\ninterestingly enough.\n\n517\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.200\nI can't do anything to it.\n\n518\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.870\nAnd that's because Windows\nis dependent upon it.\n\n519\n00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.910\nAnd what do I mean in\nWindows is dependent upon it?\n\n520\n00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.390\nWell, look at the tab here that we\nfind in Services called Dependencies.\n\n521\n00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:29.660\nSome services depend upon\nother services to run, right?\n\n522\n00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.270\nLet me give you an example of where\nyou might do that, I want to call cab.\n\n523\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.150\nI want to call a cab, right?\n\n524\n00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.800\nWell, what service do I need in order\nto call the service that allows me\n\n525\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.340\nto use the cab?\n\n526\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.650\nI can use my cell phone, right?\n\n527\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.180\nI got to use a phone, so to use a cab,\n\n528\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.010\nI've got to use another service\nin order to call the cab.\n\n529\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.650\nWell, RPC is a lot like that\nin the fact that you can see,\n\n530\n00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:55.880\nthat the following system components\ndepend on this service, and\n\n531\n00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.030\nthis is a laundry list, and\nI mean this is a laundry list of services.\n\n532\n00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.840\nIt really runs the show with Windows-\n&gt;&gt; You could really break something if you\n\n533\n00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.480\nshut it off.\n\n534\n00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's one of the reasons\nyou find it grayed out there, and\n\n535\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.480\nthey don't allow you to interact with it.\n\n536\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.077\nBecause of the fact that you could do,\nyou guys are really packed.\n\n537\n00:27:13.077 --> 00:27:15.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Turn that one off, so notice that it\n\n538\n00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.440\nalso says that this service is also\ndependent upon another service too.\n\n539\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.320\nSo when you have this interaction between\nservices sometimes that are required.\n\n540\n00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.780\nNow there are services that\nyou can start and stop.\n\n541\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.400\nApplication identity service is one,\nbut let me give you one.\n\n542\n00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.160\nAnd Dan's gonna laugh at\nme when I say this one,\n\n543\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.450\ncuz I know he's had to\ndeal with this one a lot.\n\n544\n00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.590\nA service that sometimes just\ndoesn't like to work nicely, and\n\n545\n00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:42.640\nthat's a little service known as,\nthis one right here, the Print Spooler.\n\n546\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.193\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n547\n00:27:44.193 --> 00:27:44.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n548\n00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:47.735\n&gt;&gt; It works perfectly every time\n&gt;&gt; I'm being facetious,\n\n549\n00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:49.124\nit's a horrible thing.\n\n550\n00:27:49.124 --> 00:27:51.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me expand on that a little bit.\n\n551\n00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.340\nInside of Windows Print Spooler\nis essentially the printer,\n\n552\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.300\nit's what handles print jobs.\n\n553\n00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.850\nAnd as you guys and\ngals go into your IT careers,\n\n554\n00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.380\nyou'll notice that printers are the bane\nof pretty much IT existence.\n\n555\n00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.460\nAnd sometimes-\n&gt;&gt; I predict that\n\n556\n00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.110\nyou will be staring at your\ncomputer screen at least.\n\n557\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.470\n30% of your IT career going,\n\n558\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.775\nwhy is this printer not printing,\nwhat is the problem, I don't understand?\n\n559\n00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:13.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n560\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.260\nwe're gonna give you the golden\nticket right here, right?\n\n561\n00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.830\nThis is not only gonna be for\nthe exam like Dan has mentioned already,\n\n562\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.220\nthis is for the real world application.\n\n563\n00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.060\nSometimes you have to restart the printer\nand in Microsoft LAN restarting\n\n564\n00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.190\nthe printer unlike what we would think,\nthe physical device that I'm looking\n\n565\n00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.050\nat that I'm waiting for the paper to come\nout and it's not, is this service here\n\n566\n00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.290\nthat actually manages the entire print\nprocess and notice that I can stop it.\n\n567\n00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.430\nAll right, it's not that bad.\n\n568\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.530\nAnd then, I could turn around,\nand I could start it again.\n\n569\n00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.338\nSo we're essentially doing what Microsoft\nwould call rebooting the printer, right?\n\n570\n00:28:46.338 --> 00:28:50.000\nRather than power-cycling the printer\ndevice, I know that print device.\n\n571\n00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000\nI know that gets confusing, but\nnotice that we can do that.\n\n572\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.220\nNow I also want you to notice startup\ntypes that I can see here inside of\n\n573\n00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.740\nservices as well startup\ntypes define exactly that.\n\n574\n00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.380\nWhen the operating system launches, what\nis the state of this background process,\n\n575\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.370\nwhat is the state of this service?\n\n576\n00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.900\nAll right you'll notice\nthat there are a few.\n\n577\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.450\nThree of them have been around for\na very long time.\n\n578\n00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:13.540\nAnd that's automatic, manual and disabled.\n\n579\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.920\nAutomatic means the moment you press power\non the computer and the computer boots\n\n580\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.310\nstraps the operating system, guess what,\nthe service fires off and it launches.\n\n581\n00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.830\nManual, just like the application\nidentification service that I showed you,\n\n582\n00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.770\nthere was a reason I showed you that one.\n\n583\n00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.920\nManual means it isn't gonna start\nuntil you manually start it,\n\n584\n00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.680\nhence the name Manual, disabled?\n\n585\n00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.390\nDisabled is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n586\n00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.960\nIt means I don't care if there's\na dependency upon this one,\n\n587\n00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.250\nif you disable it, it isn't gonna start\nup when the operating system starts up.\n\n588\n00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.380\nSo what is this last one?\n\n589\n00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.190\nThis last one was kind of a newer one\nthat they introduced inside of Windows 7,\n\n590\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.810\nbecause of the fact that there were so\n\n591\n00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:54.870\nmany things that were slowing\ndown the boot process in Vista.\n\n592\n00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.450\nMicrosoft got wise,\nthey said, you know what?\n\n593\n00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.600\nSome of these services, they're not\nessential to the boot process itself.\n\n594\n00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.260\nMight be essential to the functionality\nafter the operating system is online.\n\n595\n00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.750\nSo you know what we'll do?\n\n596\n00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.770\nThis will be an automatic type,\nbut it'll be a delayed start.\n\n597\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.470\nLet's optimize the boot process, and\n\n598\n00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.190\nwe'll say since it's not relevant to\nthe boot process, just keep it out.\n\n599\n00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.700\nOnce the operating system has\nbootstrapped the hardware,\n\n600\n00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.420\nit's controlling it, then we'll ahead,\nand we'll start that service.\n\n601\n00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.090\nSo again, that's the services console.\n\n602\n00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.350\nIt is something that is very important.\n\n603\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:30.060\nAnd like again say 30% of your IT career\nis shaking that printer and waiting for\n\n604\n00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.100\na progress bar.\n\n605\n00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.220\nYou might need to know\nwhere to go to services and\n\n606\n00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.550\nhow you would start and stop these.\n\n607\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.230\nSo just fill the utilities and again Dan\nthis is another one where I think I've\n\n608\n00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.280\ntalked a little bit too\nmuch cuz we got more to go.\n\n609\n00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.531\n&gt;&gt; Actually I would say you haven't talked\nenough cuz we just don't have enough time.\n\n610\n00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:46.955\n[LAUGH] That's the problem right there.\n\n611\n00:30:46.955 --> 00:30:48.784\nWell at least we don't have\nenough time in this episode.\n\n612\n00:30:48.784 --> 00:30:53.500\nSo we'll, continue with a part three, I\nthink we're on at this point in time Wes,\n\n613\n00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.240\nwe do appreciate you\ndropping by today though.\n\n614\n00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.310\nWe do appreciate our good studio audience\nout there, enjoying this, taking it in.\n\n615\n00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.260\nBecoming hardcore A+ techs, it's gonna be\nawesome when you get that certification.\n\n616\n00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.540\nIt'll be a lot of fun that being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode, so\n\n617\n00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.680\nwe're about to sign off.\n\n618\n00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.430\nFor ITPro.TV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n619\n00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.661\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes talking way too much Bryan.\n\n620\n00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:16.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next time.\n\n621\n00:31:16.155 -->

00:00:12.153\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:13.922\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.229\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:19.270\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we are moving\n\n7\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.650\non with more in our A+ series, and that's\nright, we've switched over to software.\n\n8\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.280\nSo if you're looking for\n\n9\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.150\nhardware, that's the other set of A+\nseries that you need to go check out.\n\n10\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.519\nWe are in the 22902 for today's show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.172\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain, to continue looking at\n\n12\n00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:39.460\nMicrosoft Window's tools that\nare found inside of well, guess what?\n\n13\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.640\nOn Microsoft Windows Operating System.\n\n14\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280\nIt's our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.560\nWes, we're glad to have you back man.\n\n16\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.634\nWe're continuing this little train of\nconsequences that is, the Microsoft tools.\n\n17\n00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:49.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n18\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.940\nit's great to be here man.\n\n19\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.670\nThat's right cuz, what are we doing?\n\n20\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.360\nWe're getting you prepared for\na certification.\n\n21\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.990\nBut, you know what?\n\n22\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.609\nWe're also looking at those utilities and\ntools like Daniel said that are allowing\n\n23\n00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.711\nyou to maintain the Stability of your\nOpTime of your operating system,\n\n24\n00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.622\ndo general maintenance if you will,\npreventative maintenance.\n\n25\n00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:08.243\nAnd in the end, maybe it look like\nthe hero of the day, if you will,\n\n26\n00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:12.323\nbecause you could fix some problems for\nthe end users that are calling you or\n\n27\n00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:15.403\nif not else maybe keeping\nthe end users off of your back.\n\n28\n00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:17.743\nSo we're going to continue on in the list,\nand\n\n29\n00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.209\nwe've been talking about\na bunch of them so far.\n\n30\n00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.346\nWe've been talking more on the\nadministrative tool side, and remember,\n\n31\n00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:25.603\nthe administrative tools\ninside the control panel.\n\n32\n00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:29.019\nWe talk about things like computer\nmanagement, device manager,\n\n33\n00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:31.930\nlocal users and groups,\nlocal security policy.\n\n34\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.930\nA very good one that I like and I've\nused quite often, a performance monitor.\n\n35\n00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.922\nA way that we can take our different\ncomponents within our system,\n\n36\n00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:45.482\nwhether it be things like your hardware,\nspecifically CPU, your memory,\n\n37\n00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:49.771\nyour system memory, RAM,\nas well as hard drives, network adapters.\n\n38\n00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:53.750\nAnd we can really just look\nat the performance, right?\n\n39\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.017\nAnd we can add things like\ndifferent characteristics or\n\n40\n00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.103\nattributes through counters, and\n\n41\n00:01:59.103 --> 00:02:03.355\nwe can give measurements of the\nperformance of any device or component.\n\n42\n00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:07.408\nNow, what we are gonna dive into now is\nsomething known as system configuration,\n\n43\n00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:09.066\nright, system configuration.\n\n44\n00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:13.690\nWe are also going to revisit\nthis in a command line.\n\n45\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.480\nWhen I say command line,\nmore of a run line as well,\n\n46\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.070\nbecause system configuration,\nwhile found in administrative tools,\n\n47\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.880\nis launched in a couple\nof different contexts.\n\n48\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.960\nLet me go ahead and show you, Dan.\n\n49\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.610\nAnd then when we get to our list where\nwe're talking about something known as\n\n50\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.390\nMSConfig, we'll have already\nbasically covered it.\n\n51\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.794\nAnd the reason I say that is because,\nwell, System Configuration,\n\n52\n00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:34.669\nlet me show you, right?\n\n53\n00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:40.078\nSo, I'm at our Windows 7 machine,\nlike we've been in pretty much a lot.\n\n54\n00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:42.869\nAnd if I go to the Start button,\ngo to Control Panel,\n\n55\n00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.180\nsame thing in Windows 8.1 and,\nagain, in Windows Vista.\n\n56\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.760\nSo we'll save ourselves a little\nbit of time, but definitely be\n\n57\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.670\nfamiliar with how to get to the different\nlocations across multiple versions of\n\n58\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.580\nWindows like we've been stressing\nthrough the software series here at 902.\n\n59\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.980\nAnd then we go to administrative tools and\nthen inside of administrative tools,\n\n60\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this down and\n\n61\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.860\ngive us a little more real\nestate on the screen.\n\n62\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.064\nIf we, you can kinda dive right in, you're\ngonna see this system configuration right\n\n63\n00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:13.232\nand you can see if we do a little\nbit of hovering to discover right,\n\n64\n00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:15.379\nI love that term, hover to discover right?\n\n65\n00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.806\nIf we hover, it says perform advanced\ntroubleshooting and system configuration.\n\n66\n00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.744\nNow if I launch this, right,\nwe'll go ahead and double click on it,\n\n67\n00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:24.650\nwe'll launch it, and\nthis is your system configuration utility.\n\n68\n00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.592\nNow, I say that we'll also take a look\nat something called msconfig right?\n\n69\n00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.256\nLet me go ahead and shut this down, and\n\n70\n00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:34.130\nwe're gonna use our little\nWindows keyboard shortcut, right?\n\n71\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.750\nWe're gonna do a Windows key R and\n\n72\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.100\nthis is gonna bring up the old\ntraditional run line, right?\n\n73\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.330\nAnd I'm gonna type essentially\na run line command.\n\n74\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.060\nNow, it is msconfig, and\nyou could put the .exe here.\n\n75\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.570\nI'm gonna get a little specific on this\nbecause we have some of them like, for\n\n76\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.865\ninstance, if we're doing something like,\ncomputer management which is compmgmt but\n\n77\n00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:04.490\nthe extension is .msc.\n\n78\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.075\nAgain, cuz it's a Microsoft management\nconsole, system configuration,\n\n79\n00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:09.115\nit's a little bit different.\n\n80\n00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:12.393\nIt's really not a Microsoft management\nconsole as it is an application.\n\n81\n00:04:12.393 --> 00:04:16.635\nSo it's an executable, and again the\nreason I'm getting specific is cuz they\n\n82\n00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:18.755\nmight ask you that on the exam, right?\n\n83\n00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:22.275\nOne of the things that they might do, and\nlet me make a little modification here.\n\n84\n00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:26.035\nI'll show you guys a really cool trick if\nyou're ever showing somebody something\n\n85\n00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:29.025\nin the operating system,\nhow you can kind of focus in on it.\n\n86\n00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:31.998\nI'm gonna go to completely off topic,\ncompletely off the objectives, but\n\n87\n00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:34.601\nyou know, like Dan has mentioned\nin other episodes, sometimes,\n\n88\n00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.315\nit's just about some of the stuff\nthat you'll see in the real world.\n\n89\n00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:39.228\nI'm gonna go to hardware and sound.\n\n90\n00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:40.362\nI'm gonna go to mouse and\n\n91\n00:04:40.362 --> 00:04:43.020\nI should have had this done\nbefore we started the episode.\n\n92\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.680\nBut kind of cool to show you\nguys this mouse properties and\n\n93\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.890\nyou can adjust different things\nlike your pointer options.\n\n94\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.664\nAnd I love this little setting right here,\n\n95\n00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.843\nshow location of your\npointer when I press control.\n\n96\n00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:53.714\n[LAUGH] And I'll go ahead and\nchoose okay to that.\n\n97\n00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:57.336\nNow, I'll again, that's off topic here\nbut, I do want you to see that something\n\n98\n00:04:57.336 --> 00:05:00.749\nthat they might do is they might say okay,\nyou need to look launched something\n\n99\n00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.238\nlike computer management which we've\nalready talk to, talked about right?\n\n100\n00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:08.051\nAnd it's compmgmt from the command line.\n\n101\n00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:09.770\nThen it's a .msc.\n\n102\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.300\nWell in the answer list that you might get\n\n103\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.380\non the exam they might\nsay something like .exe.\n\n104\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.060\nWell, if I run .exe, I want you to\nnotice something here right away.\n\n105\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.739\nNotice that it tells me it\ncannot find compmgmt.exe.\n\n106\n00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:29.450\nIt isn't an executable.\n\n107\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.358\nIt's a Microsoft management consult.\n\n108\n00:05:31.358 --> 00:05:36.954\nSo again, that's why I want you to know\nthat when we launch some of these,\n\n109\n00:05:36.954 --> 00:05:40.950\nWindows is smart enough that\nif I just did compmgmt.\n\n110\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.517\nAnd you know what?\n\n111\n00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:42.880\nIt does need that extension.\n\n112\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.735\nAs you get into Windows 8.1, the search\nengine, and in Windows 10 the search\n\n113\n00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:50.140\nengine's enough that it can,\nwhat do they call it, delineate.\n\n114\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.390\nAnd it knows, you're talking\nabout computer management and\n\n115\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.950\nyou don't necessarily have to put .exe or\n.mse.\n\n116\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.333\nHere in the earlier to leading up to\nWindows 7 you can see that you do need it.\n\n117\n00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:04.336\nAll right, so a little side road there but\nthat is something that is important on\n\n118\n00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:08.039\nthe exam so that's kind why we went off\nthe beaten path a little bit there so\n\n119\n00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.064\nyou guys are aware that when\nI'm going to launch MS Config.\n\n120\n00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:16.440\nI'm going to want to put the .exe as\nwell as knowing that for the exam.\n\n121\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.720\nIt looks like we've got some history\ngoing on there, so let's try that again.\n\n122\n00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.860\nMS Config.exe, and let's see if I can\nzoom in there so you guys can see that.\n\n123\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.220\nNow, remember,\nwe went to the administrative tools, and\n\n124\n00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.180\nwe launched system configuration.\n\n125\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.820\nAnd now, we're back to MS config.\n\n126\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.970\nWell, what the heck are we talking about?\n\n127\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.140\nWell, when I go ahead and\nrun this, I notice something.\n\n128\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.090\nThey're identical.\n\n129\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.710\nThat's another,\na little bit of an exam alert.\n\n130\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.860\nJust to let you know, don't let that\nconfuse you or trip you up on the exam.\n\n131\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.330\nLike we've been showing you,\ndemonstrating and\n\n132\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.760\nreally harping on through\nthe software episodes here.\n\n133\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.570\nThere's six different ways\nto get to certain things\n\n134\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.820\nwithin the operating system.\n\n135\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.410\nIt might be three,\nmight be six, might be ten,\n\n136\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.360\nand they could hold you accountable for\nany which one of those ways.\n\n137\n00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.526\nSo do realize that on your\ncertification account.\n\n138\n00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Wes was it Vista that\nthey took this away from us?\n\n139\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.030\nBecause I remember having it in XP and\nit was like I love the msconfig.\n\n140\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.810\nI type that in, I have this lovely little\nbox that helps me troubleshoot and\n\n141\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.670\nlook for problems in certain areas.\n\n142\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.260\nAnd I think it went away for a moment, and\nthen they brought it back in Windows 7,\n\n143\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.250\nI think it was Vista.\n\n144\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.930\n&gt;&gt; It's actually been around\nbrown I think you might actually,\n\n145\n00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.640\ncuz I know you've been in the business for\na while.\n\n146\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.730\nI wanna say it could have been\nsome of the earlier ones.\n\n147\n00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.160\nAs far as I know, I know it's VIST, I know\nit's in Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10.\n\n148\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.680\nNow, there are, and there are some\nmajor changes to system configuration\n\n149\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.590\nthat we really have to\naddress in this episode.\n\n150\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.614\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's what I'm thinking about.\n\n151\n00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:43.779\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think I know\nexactly where you're going and\n\n152\n00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:47.560\nyou tell me when we showed this,\nbecause there was a major change.\n\n153\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.100\nSomething that you had been doing for\na long time in MS Config or\n\n154\n00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.541\nSystem Configuration.\n\n155\n00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:56.136\nThat when Windows 8.1 came out, they\n86'd the functionality all together and\n\n156\n00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:58.070\nI think that's what you're talking about.\n\n157\n00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.131\n&gt;&gt; That might be exactly\nwhat I'm thinking of.\n\n158\n00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:01.043\nI think he's on the right\npath here [LAUGH].\n\n159\n00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:02.636\n&gt;&gt; And we'll follow along here and\n\n160\n00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:05.421\nlet's see if I can throw Dan\noff the beaten path as well.\n\n161\n00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:08.410\nThrow the rock in the com\npond of understanding here.\n\n162\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.220\nSo system configuration allows us to do\nand you can see when we hovered over it,\n\n163\n00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.980\nsome of the things right\nit says advanced system,\n\n164\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.770\ntroubleshooting and\nsome system diagnostics, right?\n\n165\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.540\nWell really what system\nconfiguration is about and\n\n166\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.920\nespecially are these first couple of tabs.\n\n167\n00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.687\nIs it modifies how Windows starts up,\nright?\n\n168\n00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:28.075\nSo why might we want to do that, right?\n\n169\n00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:31.081\nWell in a normal start up, I want\nyou to understand and I love some of\n\n170\n00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:35.090\nthe descriptions here, because it says\nload all device drivers and services.\n\n171\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.340\nWell what does that mean?\n\n172\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.860\nThat means when Windows loads\nthe operating system, right?\n\n173\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.290\nWhen the boot manager, if you will,\nbootstraps the operating system and\n\n174\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.460\nbrings it online,\nit loads all device drivers and services.\n\n175\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.366\nWell you might say well, wait a second\ndon't we need those device drivers and\n\n176\n00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:52.729\nservices in order to get\nthe operating system functional?\n\n177\n00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:54.670\nAnd the answer is no, no, we don't.\n\n178\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.200\nAnd we don't need all\nthe device drivers too, right?\n\n179\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.510\nSo for instance,\nif I want to troubleshoot something and\n\n180\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.030\nI don't need networking, why do I need a\nnetworking driver for the adaptor, right?\n\n181\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.390\nSo there are situations, and\n\n182\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.950\nhere's another thing too, is that Windows\nhas a lot of built in drivers, right?\n\n183\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.730\nYou might hear some of the other hosts\nif you watch some of the other episodes\n\n184\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.420\ntalking about it's baked right\nin here to the operating system.\n\n185\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.760\nWell, we just mean that as jargon.\n\n186\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.020\nIt doesn't matter if you're talking about\nan application, a program, or a driver.\n\n187\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.700\nIt means it's built into the operating\nsystem by default, right?\n\n188\n00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.230\nSo I don't need third party drivers.\n\n189\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.750\nAnd in a diagnostic purpose, I might\nwanna do a diagnostic service, right?\n\n190\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.500\nWhich says, load only the basic\ndevices and services only.\n\n191\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.360\nNow, be careful with that one, right?\n\n192\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.810\nBecause what we're saying here is,\nkeep anything out of the boot process\n\n193\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.450\nthat isn't necessary for\nthe operating system to function, right?\n\n194\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.890\nWe've already showed you in the previous\n\n195\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.700\npart here in this little mini series\nthat we're doing on Windows tools that\n\n196\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.010\nI don't need a print spooler\nin a diagnostic situation.\n\n197\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.226\nCuz in a diagnostic and\ntroubleshooting situation I don't,\n\n198\n00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:59.610\nI'm probably not going to\nprint to the printer, right?\n\n199\n00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.800\nWhat I'm gonna do is figure\nout why I'm blue screening.\n\n200\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.750\nSo I don't need that service,\n\n201\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.080\nlet alone the driver that manages\nthat service to be communicating.\n\n202\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.790\nSo, this would modify the way\nWindows starts up, right?\n\n203\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.530\nSo keep in mind,\nload system services, right?\n\n204\n00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.870\nNow when we talk about\nsystem services versus all\n\n205\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.410\nof the services that we see, right?\n\n206\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.890\nSystem services says, what is the critical\nservices that, if they don't run,\n\n207\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.650\nlike the RPC that we showed\nin the services console.\n\n208\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.112\nWhat are the critical services that are\nabsolutely essential to the functionality\n\n209\n00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:35.820\nof the operating system?\n\n210\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.260\nJust load those.\n\n211\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.980\nBecause what can happen with\nother services, well and drivers?\n\n212\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.740\nWell your third party drivers could be the\nreason that you're having a problem with\n\n213\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.660\nthe operating system to begin with.\n\n214\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.480\nThe reason you get a progress\nbar that kind of comes up and\n\n215\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.310\nit stops and\nthen it restarts the machine altogether.\n\n216\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.380\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you kind of what I mean here.\n\n217\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.960\nIn fact,\nlet me kind of switch through here.\n\n218\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.020\nI've actually got a problem with\none of my Vista machines, Dan.\n\n219\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.380\nAnd I think you know what I'll do here,\nbud, is I'm gonna use this is kind of\n\n220\n00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.810\nlike a learning a way to teach\nyou guys basically, right?\n\n221\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.850\nSo let me go ahead and I'm gonna boot the-\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moment as Von calls it.\n\n222\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.781\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moment, there we go.\n\n223\n00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:20.459\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I love that.\n\n224\n00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:22.014\nYeah, that's a great way to put it, right?\n\n225\n00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:25.600\nSo here in the background I've got\nthe Vista machine booting up, right?\n\n226\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.213\nAnd it's booting up,\nit's going through it's boot process.\n\n227\n00:11:28.213 --> 00:11:31.420\nI don't have a diagnostic\nboot going on right now.\n\n228\n00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.850\nI have the other boot that we've seen,\nright?\n\n229\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:34.890\nIt is loading everything.\n\n230\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.710\nIt's loading all the services, it's\nloading all of the device drivers here.\n\n231\n00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.500\nAnd it is trying to bootstrap\nessentially the operating system and\n\n232\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.270\ntake over the hardware.\n\n233\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.590\nNow, in a situation where\nwe don't have services or\n\n234\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.120\ndrivers that are causing a problem,\nthat's exactly.\n\n235\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.550\nNotice what's happening right here.\n\n236\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.630\nI don't know if you guys can see that.\n\n237\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.340\n&gt;&gt; Kinda jittery.\n\n238\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.990\n&gt;&gt; See how it's jittering?\n\n239\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.720\nAnd now we've got CHKDSK.\n\n240\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.730\nCHKDSK just went on and said-\n&gt;&gt; That's no bueno.\n\n241\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.110\n&gt;&gt; There's something wrong with this\noperating system and I just had a crash.\n\n242\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.270\nNow you can't tell it,\ncuz it didn't lock it up.\n\n243\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.310\nIt didn't do a blue screen but\n\n244\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.330\nnow it's asking me if I want\nto boot into safe mode, right?\n\n245\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.920\nSo, this is one of the things, and\n\n246\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.060\nI'll show you where you can actually\nforce this to happen inside a system\n\n247\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.640\nconfiguration, where now this is\nwhat your diagnostic mode is doing.\n\n248\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.990\nIt's going, notice that we have\na very low resolution solution here.\n\n249\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.820\nResolution solution?\n\n250\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.020\nThat's right I'm a poet and\ndidn't know it.\n\n251\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.270\n&gt;&gt; This sounds like a album name [LAUGH].\n\n252\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.396\n&gt;&gt; That's right that's right that's\nthe next heavy metal album, right [LAUGH]?\n\n253\n00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.230\nNotice what we have.\n\n254\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.550\nWe have a very low resolution screen here.\n\n255\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.070\nAnd that's because Windows says okay there\nis a problem with your operating system,\n\n256\n00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.410\nso what I'm not going to do is load\nthe third party manufacturer's\n\n257\n00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.471\nvideo driver, right?\n\n258\n00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.560\nIt could be causing the problem.\n\n259\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.570\nAll right.\n\n260\n00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.950\nSo that's what, if you will, system\nconfiguration allows me to do, right?\n\n261\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.460\nIt allows me if I go to the boot tab here,\nI can do exactly that.\n\n262\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.040\nNotice the safe boot there?\n\n263\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.920\nThis is where I can do this inside\nof the operating system, right?\n\n264\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.480\nWell, I might want to for\ndiagnostic purposes.\n\n265\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.240\nI might want to restart this machine\nin a safe boot that doesn't load,\n\n266\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.830\nminimal, right?\n\n267\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.490\nSo let's explain minimal.\n\n268\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.230\nJust load the basic drivers\nthat are essential for\n\n269\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.710\nthe operating system to function.\n\n270\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.500\nJust load the basic services\nthat are essential for\n\n271\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.680\nthe operating system to function and\nkeep everything else out of the mix.\n\n272\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.260\nAnd then what I can do is if I figure out,\nhey maybe this happened at the point that\n\n273\n00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.370\nI installed the latest and\ngreatest video driver.\n\n274\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.450\nAnd now,\n\n275\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.560\nI essentially get this problem that you\ncan see here that's kinda going on.\n\n276\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.570\nIt's trying to load here.\n\n277\n00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.690\nWe'll see if it actually does load.\n\n278\n00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.800\nAnd this is what I see,\nabsolutely nothing.\n\n279\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.800\nWell then again that's a problem.\n\n280\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.050\nSo when I load this minimalistic boot\nprocess I keep that out of it, right?\n\n281\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.180\nWell, maybe it's so\n\n282\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.290\nbad that even the video, even the low\nresolution video doesn't work at all.\n\n283\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.070\nThis can happen when you\nhave like chipset drivers.\n\n284\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.060\nIn fact, we were talking to one of our\nviewers in the chatroom the other day.\n\n285\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.170\nThis can happen when you have\na chipset driver that's going bad.\n\n286\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.300\nBecause what happens at that point,\nit means that your operating system\n\n287\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.290\ncan't even function with the integrated\nvideo on the motherboard itself.\n\n288\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.610\nWell, in that case, what I can do is I\ncan keep the graphical user interface\n\n289\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.830\nout of it all together, and\nI can do alternate shell.\n\n290\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.690\nAnd the only thing I can\nget is a command prompt.\n\n291\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.350\nNow with somebody like Dan, you have to\nunderstand, that's not gonna be a problem.\n\n292\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.950\nWhy?\n\n293\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.370\nBecause he works heavily with\nLinux Operating Systems where\n\n294\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.350\nyou turn the operating system on,\nthat's what you get.\n\n295\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.470\nYou get a text editor.\n\n296\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.330\nOr it's not a editor, but you get-\n&gt;&gt; A command line.\n\n297\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.620\n&gt;&gt; A command line interface.\n\n298\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.770\nAnd that's all you get.\n\n299\n00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.910\nSo for\npeople like Dan that is perfectly fine.\n\n300\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.810\nHowever if you're just starting out,\nbe warned text based input,\n\n301\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.940\ntext based output.\n\n302\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.565\nYou don't get anything else.\n\n303\n00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:39.730\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Swiss for newbies.\n\n304\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.988\nI don't know where do I click?\n\n305\n00:14:40.988 --> 00:14:42.083\n[LAUGH] You don't.\n\n306\n00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:42.832\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly so\n\n307\n00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:45.787\nbe careful using\nthe alternate shell right?\n\n308\n00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:48.731\nWhen they say alternate shell essentially\nwhat they're saying is they're going to\n\n309\n00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:50.770\ngive you a Windows command prompt and\nthat's all you get.\n\n310\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.100\nNetworking I'm not worried\nabout Active Directory repair.\n\n311\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.330\nThis is in a server class.\n\n312\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.860\nIf you want to learn more\nabout Active Directory as you\n\n313\n00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.990\nprogress through your training or if now\nyou're one of our subscription members.\n\n314\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.350\nWe got a lot of Active Directory.\n\n315\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.570\nMike Rodrick is one of our\nActive Directory gurus there.\n\n316\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.500\nBump on over to some of those shows,\nright?\n\n317\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.500\nBut networking means, hey, maybe there's\na driver that I still need to download.\n\n318\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.820\nMaybe I've got a corrupted driver in that\nvideo card and that's causing the problem.\n\n319\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.110\nSo what I want you to do, go ahead and\nload the basic network adapter driver.\n\n320\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.540\nNot the one that's for the Intel the fancy\nIntel gigabyte card or the one that's for\n\n321\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:31.350\nBroadcom or the one for\nAsus or Gigabyte motherboards.\n\n322\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.190\nLoad the generic Windows driver\nthat just says, all right,\n\n323\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.670\nI'm gonna give you basic\nconnectivity to your network so\n\n324\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.980\nthat you can communicate\noutbound with the Internet.\n\n325\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.830\nConnect to the manufacturer's website and\n\n326\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.440\ndownload that driver,\nhopefully to fix the problem.\n\n327\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.751\nNow lets see if Vista, okay so\nVista has launched up, right?\n\n328\n00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:52.771\nAnd if we can take a look this is what you\nwould essentially see if you modified and\n\n329\n00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:54.515\ndid a minimalistic boot, right?\n\n330\n00:15:54.515 --> 00:16:00.131\nAnd if I launch into this Again,\nsorry for the little screen.\n\n331\n00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:04.890\nThere isn't a way to basically\nto fix the resolution here.\n\n332\n00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.500\nWe have a very low resolution.\n\n333\n00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.040\nIf you guys are coming over from 901, we\ntalked about BGA mode is what they call it\n\n334\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.070\nin the exam objectives that\nI said Low Resolution Mode.\n\n335\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.206\nThat's essentially what it says.\n\n336\n00:16:16.206 --> 00:16:20.302\nThe other way we look at it is,\nwe also call it Safe Mode, right?\n\n337\n00:16:20.302 --> 00:16:23.540\nSo, when I said Safe Mode, that's\nexactly what's kind of happening and\n\n338\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.440\nlet's letting me know hey, Windows has\nrecovered from unexpected shutdown and\n\n339\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.390\nat this point, what I can do,\nis I can go to our Start button\n\n340\n00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.065\nlook at even the Start Menu,\nlooks like the Classic Menu.\n\n341\n00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:38.075\nI can launch up Event Viewer and\n\n342\n00:16:38.075 --> 00:16:39.865\nwe're gonna try to do some\ntroubleshooting here on the fly.\n\n343\n00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.315\nCuz I'm kinda curious, Dan,\n\n344\n00:16:41.315 --> 00:16:45.375\nas to what's going on because here cuz we\ndid talk about Event Viewer in 902 and\n\n345\n00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:49.180\nwe said, hey, you asked a good question,\nsaid hey, what is important?\n\n346\n00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.240\nWhat of these logs are important?\n\n347\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.490\nOne of the ones I told you was system.\n\n348\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.380\nLet's find out what we got.\n\n349\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.730\nWe got a lot going on.\n\n350\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.515\n&gt;&gt; Looks fine.\n\n351\n00:16:57.515 --> 00:16:59.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even filter the logs on this\n\n352\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.280\none and all I see is error, error,\nerror, error, error, error, error.\n\n353\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.420\nOkay, so we've got a problem, right?\n\n354\n00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.755\nAnd that's not the worst part of it.\n\n355\n00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:11.524\nError errors aren't the worst part, right?\n\n356\n00:17:11.524 --> 00:17:15.740\nWhat I'm looking for and I'm gonna go\nahead and filter this to critical.\n\n357\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.302\nAnd well, I guess\n&gt;&gt; I guess circles.\n\n358\n00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:20.332\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say apparently\nerrors are the worst [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:20.917\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n360\n00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:22.111\n&gt;&gt; So let's go to errors.\n\n361\n00:17:22.111 --> 00:17:25.922\nAnd a lot of times what you can see is\nthat there's some kind of Kernel power\n\n362\n00:17:25.922 --> 00:17:26.486\nfailure.\n\n363\n00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:33.762\nSo, and I'm not seeing anything here,\nso let's just take this service one.\n\n364\n00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:36.271\nAll right, what this looks\nlike is it says that a device\n\n365\n00:17:36.271 --> 00:17:39.602\nattached to the system is not functioning,\nit's directly related to,\n\n366\n00:17:39.602 --> 00:17:42.020\nif you will,\nthings like the network adapter here.\n\n367\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.220\nSo we've got some issues going on.\n\n368\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.390\nAnd again, If I switch back over to my\nWindows 7 machine, if this was happening,\n\n369\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.300\nthis would give me the ability by\ngoing into safe boot, if you will, and\n\n370\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.630\nlaunch that essentially Safe Mode, right?\n\n371\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.617\nI could do things like,\nfor instance, no GUI boot.\n\n372\n00:17:57.617 --> 00:18:00.260\nNo GUI boot says,\ndon't even load up the video drivers.\n\n373\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.776\nEssentially give me the basic boot.\n\n374\n00:18:02.776 --> 00:18:05.160\n&gt;&gt; And just for\nthe audience's edification,\n\n375\n00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.287\nif I would have saw that windsock here,\n\n376\n00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:11.720\nI'd probably done an net sh windsock\nreset command at a command prompt.\n\n377\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.190\nAnd that would actually rebuild\nthe TCP IP stack within my\n\n378\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.380\noperating system to see\nif that fixes the issue.\n\n379\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.080\n&gt;&gt; Probably not something you're\ngonna see on the exam, but\n\n380\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.920\nyou better write that down.\n\n381\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.660\n&gt;&gt; That's good stuff.\n\n382\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's worth it's weight in gold because\n\n383\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.480\nsometimes what happens is when\nthe operating system is loading,\n\n384\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.670\nwhat it does is quite a few things.\n\n385\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.850\nYou kinda see them scroll by, real fast.\n\n386\n00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.330\nIt initializes the File system which\ngives me access to the hard drive.\n\n387\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.520\nIt allows me to work with the files\nwithin the operating system.\n\n388\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.250\nBut the other thing it does is it\nhas to initiate the network adaptor.\n\n389\n00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:49.400\nAnd when that communication DNA if you\nwill, he said the protocol stack, right.\n\n390\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.040\nThink of it as the DNA, how we communicate\nwith the network gets all jumbled up.\n\n391\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.285\nBasically, what Dan said is hey,\nyou're essentially power recycling.\n\n392\n00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:02.630\nYou'rer rebooting if you\nwill that communication and\n\n393\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.520\nit rebuilds it in the right order.\n\n394\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.970\nIt is worth its weight in gold.\n\n395\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.873\nI have had to do that a lot of times.\n\n396\n00:19:07.873 --> 00:19:09.992\nSo, I don't care if it's on the exam.\n\n397\n00:19:09.992 --> 00:19:13.779\nWrite it down\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's practical troubleshooting,\n\n398\n00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:16.485\nhelpful things that you\nwill use as a technician.\n\n399\n00:19:16.485 --> 00:19:19.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's one of those things\nthat you can walk away today and\n\n400\n00:19:19.662 --> 00:19:23.260\nbecome the hero tomorrow,\nwhether you're certified or not.\n\n401\n00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.880\nSo, thanks for\nthrowing that in there by all means.\n\n402\n00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.340\nSome of the other ones we're\nnot gonna get into too much.\n\n403\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.650\nIf we could look back here at\nour Windows 7 machine services,\n\n404\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.200\nit does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n405\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.510\nIt gives me a very basic way that I\ncould kinda disable or enable services.\n\n406\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.540\nRemember, we've already looked\nat the Services Console,\n\n407\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.439\nit gives you a lot more flexibility\nin what you can do with the surfaces.\n\n408\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Services.\n\n409\n00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.910\n&gt;&gt; Services, well.\n\n410\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.670\n&gt;&gt; We do love you to get to\nthe services inside Windows, man.\n\n411\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.620\nThere's like 19 different ways,.\n\n412\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.720\nThat's a little over four but a lot.\n\n413\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.987\nThere's a lot of ways to get to services.\n\n414\n00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:59.968\n&gt;&gt; Sure and here's another one that we\ntalk about that's worth it's weight in\n\n415\n00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:01.740\ngold, is tools.\n\n416\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.650\nWhen we look at tools here, this has\na access, kind of a one click access if\n\n417\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.980\nyou will, to launch many different\nutilities inside of Windows.\n\n418\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.610\nThat's one of the things I love\nabout system configuration.\n\n419\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.610\nNow, you might notice\nsomething I skipped over one-\n\n420\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.540\n&gt;&gt; You did it.\n\n421\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd this is the one I was leaving Dan with\n\n422\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.704\nthe whole cliffhanger.\n\n423\n00:20:20.704 --> 00:20:22.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the cliffhanger.\n\n424\n00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:23.120\n&gt;&gt; This is the cliffhanger.\n\n425\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.535\nRemember Dan says,\nsomething changed and he's right.\n\n426\n00:20:25.535 --> 00:20:27.270\nIt was drastic change.\n\n427\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.940\nRight?\n\n428\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.760\nSo, up until Windows 7,\nwe had the Startup tab.\n\n429\n00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.860\nAnd in that Startup tab, one of the things\nyou could do, is you could manage\n\n430\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.438\nthe applications that would put other\napplications within the Startup boot time.\n\n431\n00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:45.762\nWell, some of the Startups applications\nthat we have here can really,\n\n432\n00:20:45.762 --> 00:20:50.745\nreally affect the time that it\ntakes to boot the operating system.\n\n433\n00:20:50.745 --> 00:20:55.169\nSo one of the things that you could do\nin fact, I usually do unless this is a,\n\n434\n00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:56.920\nit's a Security client.\n\n435\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.810\nSo outside of malware, I come in here and\nI disable every one of them by\n\n436\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.518\nchoosing disable all because\nI want the fastest boot.\n\n437\n00:21:04.518 --> 00:21:07.000\nHowever, let's put a big caveat on this,\n\n438\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.480\nparenthesis I will not mess with\nthe security platform whatever it is.\n\n439\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.620\nI don't care if it's third party,\n\n440\n00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.230\nI don't care if it's the Windows Defender\nservice that's built in,\n\n441\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:21.360\nif you've got McAfee, if you've got\nKapersky, keep those running, right.\n\n442\n00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.350\nYou don't want to disable those because\nyou need those coming online the moment\n\n443\n00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.630\nthe operating system becomes active\nbecause that is your race to protecting\n\n444\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.520\nyourself against any malicious activity\nthat might be going on in your computer.\n\n445\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.600\nSo you have to be careful with that one.\n\n446\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless you actually hinted them,\nyou talked about malware.\n\n447\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.700\nThat's why I went here so\n\n448\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.710\noften was because malware,\nI guess where it wants to go.\n\n449\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.600\nIt want's to start at boot.\n\n450\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.980\nRight?\nSo it's gonna throw itself into start up.\n\n451\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.110\nSo I would look through this list and\nlook for\n\n452\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.150\nsomething that didn't look quite right,\nor something that I didn't recognize.\n\n453\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.618\nAnd then Google search whatever\nthat Startup option was.\n\n454\n00:21:54.618 --> 00:21:56.100\nIt's known malware, great.\n\n455\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.320\nI can uncheck that.\n\n456\n00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.380\nNow I can reboot the system and\nkeep it from affecting me so\n\n457\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.340\nthat I can clean that malware\nout using a third party tool.\n\n458\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.400\nSo if my antivirus wasn't getting it or my\nantimalware software wasn't getting it, or\n\n459\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.670\nit was being blocked by the malware on\nthere, then I could do that, go in there,\n\n460\n00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.170\nshut that down, restart the computer.\n\n461\n00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.080\nMaybe even go into a Safe Mode just\nto be even more on the safe side.\n\n462\n00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.980\nAnd that was practical troubleshooting.\n\n463\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.342\nAnd when they took this away from me,\nI was in boo-hoo tears.\n\n464\n00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:26.931\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and\n\n465\n00:22:26.931 --> 00:22:30.584\nlet me go ahead and expand on what Dan's\nsaying so we can actually show you, right?\n\n466\n00:22:30.584 --> 00:22:33.524\nWell, notice that this says\nto me that it says this\n\n467\n00:22:33.524 --> 00:22:36.115\nis the Microsoft Security Client, right?\n\n468\n00:22:36.115 --> 00:22:39.040\nOkay, I know what the Security Client is,\nbut\n\n469\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.790\nhere's where it might cause problems,\nif I use this little\n\n470\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.070\nscroll bar over here I could see\nthe location that it's running at.\n\n471\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.770\nSo, some are obvious, right?\n\n472\n00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.790\nIt's not gonna come up and\noutright say, this is a virus.\n\n473\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.328\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Right?\n\n474\n00:22:54.328 --> 00:22:55.694\nI mean, it might, some it does.\n\n475\n00:22:55.694 --> 00:22:56.223\n&gt;&gt; It kinda did.\n\n476\n00:22:56.223 --> 00:22:57.159\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n477\n00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:59.583\nSome do cuz I get a random\nstring of characters but\n\n478\n00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:02.670\nwhat we can do is we could research,\nwe could go to Microsoft.\n\n479\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:07.014\nThey got some of the best documentation\nand really thorough documentation out\n\n480\n00:23:07.014 --> 00:23:09.842\nthere on where their products\nare suppose to run and\n\n481\n00:23:09.842 --> 00:23:12.493\neven manufactures of\nproducts do this as well.\n\n482\n00:23:12.493 --> 00:23:16.042\nAnd then, I can reasearch and say, okay,\nI see that this is running from programs\n\n483\n00:23:16.042 --> 00:23:19.189\nMicrosoft security client and\nthis is the executable that's running.\n\n484\n00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:22.480\nWell, Microsoft,\nis that what I'm supposed to see?\n\n485\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.910\nOkay, that's what I'm supposed to see.\n\n486\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.450\nBut then one day, Dan fires this up and\nhe sees the same exact thing, but he says,\n\n487\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:34.698\nlook, that says, C:\\ users\\appdata\\temp\nand all of the sudden\n\n488\n00:23:34.698 --> 00:23:41.980\nwe realized that it's running\nfrom not the System areas.\n\n489\n00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.060\nIt's running from the User profile.\n\n490\n00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.950\nThat's telltale sign that what\nthey have is a virus that is\n\n491\n00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:52.930\ncloned itself that on the surface,\nit looks like it is benign.\n\n492\n00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.830\nThat it is something that should be there.\n\n493\n00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.685\nAnd in reality, it isn't.\n\n494\n00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:57.712\nSo, I could come in here and\nI could disable it.\n\n495\n00:23:57.712 --> 00:24:01.346\nNow, why did I say that this is\nthe big cliffhanger, all right.\n\n496\n00:24:01.346 --> 00:24:02.683\nDrum roll, please.\n\n497\n00:24:02.683 --> 00:24:06.742\nWhat we got here is that if I go\nover to my Windows 8.1 machine, and\n\n498\n00:24:06.742 --> 00:24:09.930\nyou guys get to see how bad\nI type by trying to log in.\n\n499\n00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:10.560\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you did great.\n\n500\n00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.570\n&gt;&gt; Hey, we did it there, right?\n\n501\n00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.280\nAnd I go and again, I could use MS Config.\n\n502\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.040\nGuys, we're gonna take the scenic\napproach around, the long way, so\n\n503\n00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.490\nthat if you are studying for\nthe exam, you're good.\n\n504\n00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.050\nAgain keep in mind we're gonna go right\nclick on the little Windows tile there,\n\n505\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.440\nchoose Control Panel, System and\n\n506\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.100\nSecurity, scroll all the way down,\nAdministrative Tools.\n\n507\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.590\nI know you guys are gonna hate that\npath by the time we're done but\n\n508\n00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.550\nremember like one of my\nfavorite blues guitarist\n\n509\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.630\nsaid you never practice\nsomething till you get it right,\n\n510\n00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.790\nyou practice it until you can't get it\nwrong, then you know it's always right.\n\n511\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.560\nSo if we scroll down here\nSystem Configuration right, this would be\n\n512\n00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.605\nprobably one of the big beefs that Dan was\ntalking about and this is an extreme exam\n\n513\n00:24:50.605 --> 00:24:55.330\nalert, I can stress this enough they would\nprobably like to put this one on there.\n\n514\n00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.360\nLet's go to start up tab.\n\n515\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Man you should've just felt my heart\nsink the first day I fired up a Windows\n\n516\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:09.600\n8 machine, it said, or was it an 8 or\nan 8.1 that did this, it was an 8 right?\n\n517\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.220\nI was like whoa what is this?\n\n518\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.110\nThis is wrong,\nyou have wronged me Microsoft.\n\n519\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.200\nBut they don't leave you\ncompletely in the dark.\n\n520\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.160\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n521\n00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.810\nAnd what Dan's alluding to is\nwhat we can see on the screen.\n\n522\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.340\nIf we open Task Manager,\nwhat they did is Task Manager, and\n\n523\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.500\nwe're going to go into Task Manager\na little bit more I know we don't\n\n524\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.500\nprobably have I know we don't have time.\n\n525\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.020\nWe're going to hit Task Manager\nhere coming up but\n\n526\n00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.550\nwe're probably going to have to go into\na part seventeen here or, close enough.\n\n527\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I do wanna let you know that yes,\n\n528\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.320\nwe still have start-up.\n\n529\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.890\nBut man, you got to understand that when\nadministrators like somebody like Dan\n\n530\n00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.730\nwho's been in help desk and\nadministration for a very long time and\n\n531\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.230\nyou've got that rhythm that\nI know exactly where to go.\n\n532\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.580\nI've been doing this now for\nfive to ten years, I'm going here,\n\n533\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.590\nI'm going, wait, where did it go?\n\n534\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.470\nThat can cause problems right?\n\n535\n00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.150\nIt isn't the fact that it's gone.\n\n536\n00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.440\nNow it looks a little bit different.\n\n537\n00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.876\n&gt;&gt; They pulled the three card monty on me,\nthey're like find the queen,\n\n538\n00:26:04.876 --> 00:26:06.790\nfind the queen, follow the card,\nwhere's it going?\n\n539\n00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.432\nIt's over here now.\n\n540\n00:26:09.432 --> 00:26:09.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n541\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.773\nto Microsoft's defense one of the things\nI like about this too is because\n\n542\n00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:17.692\nof the fact that they did something\nthat wasn't in System Configuration.\n\n543\n00:26:17.692 --> 00:26:19.536\nSee in Task Manager as we'll learn,\n\n544\n00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:22.986\nyou can right click on different\nprocesses that are in this machine,\n\n545\n00:26:22.986 --> 00:26:27.000\nand you can find out the location\nof where they're actually open.\n\n546\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.420\nYou can search them online, Dan was\nsaying, hey I would come in here, and\n\n547\n00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.750\nI would look at MS Config,\nI'd look at that start up, and I Google.\n\n548\n00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.180\nWell look what we have right here,\nSearch online.\n\n549\n00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.370\nSo now they've put it in a location\nthat if you don't know what it is you\n\n550\n00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:45.050\ncan do that or even more so I can find\nout, what are the properties of this?\n\n551\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.190\nIs this a valid tool, right?\n\n552\n00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.850\nDoes it have a digital signature and\n\n553\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.850\nagain we'll talk a little bit more in our\nsecurity section about digital signatures.\n\n554\n00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.090\nJust understand it's like\na security water mark that says\n\n555\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.780\nI know who the publisher is, right?\n\n556\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.420\nThis doesn't come from Bob's back house-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n557\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.970\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering attack,\n\n558\n00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.340\nhe comes from VMware, right?\n\n559\n00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.190\nWe trust VMware and so we get a lot more\ninformation about it, which is great.\n\n560\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:11.290\nSo as a recap,\nI know we're coming close to the end here.\n\n561\n00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:16.200\nRemember, inside one of Windows 7, and\nbefore, and in this case, for the purposes\n\n562\n00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.060\nof this exam it just includes Vista and\nWindows 7, start up functionality in\n\n563\n00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.330\nMS Config/System Configuration means\nutilities are one and the same, right?\n\n564\n00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.686\nJust a different way,\napproach to finding them in Windows 8 and\n\n565\n00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:32.162\nI'm glad you mentioned that Dan, and then\nbeyond included in Windows 8.1 and even\n\n566\n00:27:32.162 --> 00:27:36.720\ntoday even though the new objectives come\nout Windows 10 will probably be included.\n\n567\n00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.270\nIt's not a 900 series so,\nI don't want you to worry about it.\n\n568\n00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.450\nWe would like to help you out here,\n\n569\n00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.320\nit's also in the same location\ninside of Windows 10, as well.\n\n570\n00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.890\nGot a lot more opportunities that you can\nwork with it here, you can could open\n\n571\n00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.550\nthe file location, and it shows you that\nhey, this is running from this location.\n\n572\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.840\nAnd it is running out of program files,\n\n573\n00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.480\nand it gives you the ability to get to\nsome of those a little bit better, right?\n\n574\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.960\nSo, keep that in mind,\nthat is your System Configuration.\n\n575\n00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.072\nDan looks like we did a great job\nin covering just one utility.\n\n576\n00:28:07.072 --> 00:28:07.617\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n577\n00:28:07.617 --> 00:28:09.670\nI will tell you we've\ngot plenty more to come.\n\n578\n00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:10.950\nJust not gonna be in this episode.\n\n579\n00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.540\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n580\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.100\nI know like Wes said, we only got through\nthe one utility in this episode but,\n\n581\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.058\nit's a very, very important one and it's\none that you need to be familiar with.\n\n582\n00:28:19.058 --> 00:28:20.040\nAll of these are but\n\n583\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.747\nman, this is one of the utilities that I\nused extensively throughout my career,\n\n584\n00:28:24.747 --> 00:28:28.380\nso I would only assume that\nthe same would be true for you.\n\n585\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.120\nDigging your heels in,\nknow MS Config like the back of your hand,\n\n586\n00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.990\nit can be a definite good friend\nto you out in the trenches.\n\n587\n00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.210\nAnd as Wes said we've run out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n588\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.390\nWe do thank you good folks for\nwatching, hopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n589\n00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.460\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n590\n00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.430\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.678\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.792\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.580\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.430\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry, and\nin today's episode you guessed it,\n\n7\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.840\nwe're back with more in our A+ series,\nthat's right, the 22902.\n\n8\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.720\nAnd joining us yet again,\ncontinuing down the long train\n\n9\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.342\nof awesome tools we find in our Windows\noperating system, our good friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:36.390\nWes Bryan is back in the studio.\n\n11\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.780\nWelcome back sir how's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.900\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.950\nDan and I were talking about,\nbefore we started this episode,\n\n14\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.400\nI'm saying we're going into a part 4,\ndid I really do these objectives right?\n\n15\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.580\nAnd Dan said,\nwell you look at the objectives and\n\n16\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.090\nwhat we got to cover it is what it is.\n\n17\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.820\nI mean because there are a lot\nof tools and utilities.\n\n18\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.390\n&gt;&gt; One or two.\n\n19\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just one or two, that's right, so\n\n20\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.940\nwe're gonna continue\nalong this train here.\n\n21\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.810\nWhere it stops, I don't know, hopefully,\n\n22\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.820\nit's at the end of the objectives here for\nWindows tools.\n\n23\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.450\nAnd we're just going to continue right on.\n\n24\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.656\nKeep in mind that we're looking at\nthe utilities that not only will make you\n\n25\n00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:13.416\nsuccessful on the exam, but Dan's already\ngiven some great real world scenarios.\n\n26\n00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:17.850\nAnd I've tried to throw some real\nworld scenarios in here, as well.\n\n27\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.160\nTo also make you successful if\nyou're maybe currently already in\n\n28\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.980\na help desk position.\n\n29\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.270\nMaybe for whatever reason it\ndidn't require certification,\n\n30\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.120\nit just required you to be tech savvy.\n\n31\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580\nOr maybe you're even a home user.\n\n32\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.050\nMaybe you like to help out some members\nof your family with computers, too.\n\n33\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.880\nI know, and now, it's kinda unfair to pick\non Dan and say, well I know you've been in\n\n34\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.530\nthe industry but I know you also\ndo the other side of that too.\n\n35\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.220\nWhere somebody's like, hey, can you help\nme out with this Windows machine, right?\n\n36\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.030\nIt's nice to have some utilities,\nand be aware of what they do.\n\n37\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.350\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna continue on.\n\n38\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.010\nKeep in mind that we've been looking\nat some of the different administrative\n\n39\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.060\nutilities that we have.\n\n40\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.860\nAnd we're gonna talk about a couple\nof them that you're gonna see\n\n41\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.050\nare gonna move a little quicker\nbecause well in some of these when it\n\n42\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.010\ncomes to just general level help desk some\nof these are a little bit more advanced.\n\n43\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.210\nAnd what we mean by advanced as that\nthey might be used by things like your\n\n44\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.730\ndevelopment teams.\n\n45\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.260\nMight be used by a database administer for\nconnection to a database.\n\n46\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.890\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nso we're on a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n47\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.380\nWe've kinda been flip-flopping back and\n\n48\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.720\nforth around the different\nversions of Windows here so\n\n49\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.670\nthat you've got a good broad knowledge and\nnot just a specific operating system.\n\n50\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.660\nBecause you probably,\n\n51\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.745\nif you read any surveys out there\nsee that there's still XP machines.\n\n52\n00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:34.809\n[LAUGH] They're still out there in the\nindustry, let alone things like Windows 7,\n\n53\n00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.271\nWindows 8, 8.1 as well.\n\n54\n00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:40.455\nSo I'm gonna go ahead just right click on\nour start tile, Windows tile there if you\n\n55\n00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:44.520\nwill, choose system and security,\nwe'll go back to administrative tools and\n\n56\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.180\nnow what we're gonna talk about is\nwell this very first one right here.\n\n57\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.130\nAnd the very first one is component\nservices right, and let me go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.160\nkinda just pull this out of the way\nhere and make this the forefront.\n\n59\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.100\nIf you kinda hover over this right it\ntalks about managing .com applications,\n\n60\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.140\nsee if I can get that show up again.\n\n61\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.820\nMaybe not,\nI was trying that one more time.\n\n62\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.940\nI want you guys to be able to see,\n\n63\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.621\nkind of hovering over that allows us\nto look at Manage COM+ applications.\n\n64\n00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:20.180\nAgain, COM+ that's actually\na part of the core system state.\n\n65\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.280\nWithin your operating systems and\nthis is more of a really advanced type of\n\n66\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.118\ntrouble shooting of you will.\n\n67\n00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:32.050\nIt talks about COM,\nDCOM you will be doing this\n\n68\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.940\nat developement level you might\nbe working with delta team.\n\n69\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.910\nThis is really outside of scope\nof even general help desk.\n\n70\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.155\nI kinda ask through the question at you.\n\n71\n00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.810\nDan, how much often have you\nused component services?\n\n72\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean all the time I've never.\n\n73\n00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:48.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly right.\n\n74\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.510\nHowever, if I say how many times\nhave you used computer management?\n\n75\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.160\n&gt;&gt; Daily.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the truth.\n\n76\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.650\nIt's not a joke,\nit really is not joking in there.\n\n77\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.200\nSo there are some of these utilities that\nyou're gonna see really on a daily basis\n\n78\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.960\nversus some that, it's there for\nfunctionality if it needs to be\n\n79\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.600\nutilized but again, unless you're\nworking like an application developer.\n\n80\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.350\nYou might not be seeing this one again so\nmuch.\n\n81\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.260\nAnd that also lends itself to another\nhere, and we've got a few different types.\n\n82\n00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.810\nThey just call out data sources\nwithin your exam objectives,\n\n83\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.940\ndon't let this fool you.\n\n84\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.090\nThe ODBC,\nthat's the Open Source Database community,\n\n85\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.880\nand you'll notice that it talks about.\n\n86\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.290\nMaintains if you will your data sources,\nyour drivers,\n\n87\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.140\nyou're gonna be using this if you're\nlike maybe a database administrator and\n\n88\n00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.110\nyou're connecting if you will to different\ntypes of databases and stuff like that.\n\n89\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.290\nAgain, really kinda outside\nof the scope of just\n\n90\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.570\nnormal help desk day to day operations and\ndaily maintenance.\n\n91\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.350\nBut again, its part of the objectives.\n\n92\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.690\nIt is inside of your\nadministrative tools so for\n\n93\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.180\nthe sake of completion of not only your\nexam preparation but also just kind of\n\n94\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.860\nunderstanding the different components\nwith inside of administrative tools.\n\n95\n00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.560\nWe did wanna bring that up.\n\n96\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.140\nNow there is another one that you could\nuse and you could use quite a bit.\n\n97\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.050\nLet's see how many windows\nI have opened back here I\n\n98\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.280\nhave mentioned Jiminy Clickets earlier.\n\n99\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.170\nI think I have definitely clicked\na lot of windows, there we go,\n\n100\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.412\nI kinda cleaned it up guys.\n\n101\n00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:24.680\nLet's come to the real\nstate on the screen here.\n\n102\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.560\nNext one is something\nknown as print management.\n\n103\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.490\nAll right, now Print Management,\nwhat are we doing?\n\n104\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.020\nAre you managing a printer, right?\n\n105\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.980\nWell yes you are, you can manage your\nprinter but you might ask yourself well\n\n106\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.870\ndon't I have prints off where that allows\nme to just manage the local printer?\n\n107\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.790\nAnd you can say yes, you do and\nit not only manages local printers but\n\n108\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.540\nit also allows you the ability,\nif I can zoom out here a little bit too.\n\n109\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.420\nManage remote print servers,\n\n110\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.730\nlet's understand what we talk about\nwhen we mention a server, right?\n\n111\n00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.370\nInside of what's known as\na client server base network.\n\n112\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.450\nYou have a client and you have a server.\n\n113\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.580\nHence the name client server.\n\n114\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.950\nWe're talking about from\nthe perspective of the software itself.\n\n115\n00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.190\ni don't want you to worry about and focus\non what kind of hardware does that run on.\n\n116\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.780\nA computer is a computer,\nis a computer, is a computer.\n\n117\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.880\nIt just depends on what role,\n\n118\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.290\nwhat functionality is it\nperforming inside of your network.\n\n119\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.410\nIf you have a client software\nrunning on your computer,\n\n120\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.830\nif you have a client operating\nsystem running on your computer,\n\n121\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.620\nthen what you have is a piece of\nsoftware that is relying on services and\n\n122\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.610\nrequesting services from other pieces of\nsoftware and computers on your network.\n\n123\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.310\nThat's why they call it a client It is\nrequesting and relying on services that\n\n124\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.920\nare provided by another computer and\nthat other computer is the server.\n\n125\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.520\nSo if you have server software, right?\n\n126\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.050\nYou have a server operating system,\nyou have a server application.\n\n127\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.670\nThat server provides a service\nto the network, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.640\nHence the term 'Client Server',\nit is two parts to the tracks; we have\n\n129\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.540\nclients that are requesting services and\nthe servers, hence the name,\n\n130\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.480\nservers provide the service they serve up\nthose resources that are being requested.\n\n131\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.190\nSo when we talk about a remote print\nserver, it could be a physical device.\n\n132\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.370\nIt absolutely could be and they come\nin all different shapes and sizes.\n\n133\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:27.075\nEven right down to the small almost\nlike Roku size print server, right?\n\n134\n00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:30.680\nAnd it's a piece of software\nthat's running on that device.\n\n135\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.850\nThat is telling the different\nprinters what to do, right.\n\n136\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.090\nA printer could be kinda\nsometimes considered kinda like\n\n137\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.910\na client operating system in the fact\nthat is listening out saying hey!\n\n138\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.119\nI need a little bit of direction here.\n\n139\n00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:45.969\nSend me your print job, right?\n\n140\n00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.607\nNow, understand that\nyour network printers can\n\n141\n00:07:48.607 --> 00:07:52.354\nhave the print server functionality\nbuilt right into them, right?\n\n142\n00:07:52.354 --> 00:07:57.696\nAnd in this way what happens is they\nare managing their own print jobs, well.\n\n143\n00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:00.962\nIf you have multiple printers\nwithin your networks and\n\n144\n00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:04.168\neach one of them has the print\nserver functionality.\n\n145\n00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:07.410\nYes, you could do the old sneakernet,\nright?\n\n146\n00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.370\nI could go printer to printer to printer\nto printer and just keep doing this.\n\n147\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.344\nAnd, all I'm doing all day is walking\nto various printers within my network.\n\n148\n00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:19.989\nOr I got up a print server type\nsoftware that consolidates not only\n\n149\n00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:24.972\nlocal printers attached via a cable or\na wireless connection directly\n\n150\n00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:29.109\nto a single computer, but\nall of the other print servers or\n\n151\n00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:34.080\nsoftware running on these\nprinters in a single location.\n\n152\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.240\nHence, we'll all wait around it, but\n\n153\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.150\nto explain what Print Management\nis doing for us.\n\n154\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.710\nPrint Management is essentially\nallowing us to consolidate\n\n155\n00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.480\nprinters that are being managed across\nthe networks, maybe by themselves,\n\n156\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.330\nor even other print servers, right?\n\n157\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.970\nAnd we can see this all\nin a single location.\n\n158\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.531\nWe can add, and you can see, this is just\na local print server Windows itself,\n\n159\n00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:04.150\nclient, server, operating system,\ndoesn't matter, can act as a print server.\n\n160\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.810\nAll right, and again, so\nwhat's the print server doing?\n\n161\n00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.290\nAll right, well a print server,\nin general, what it does is it allows you,\n\n162\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:17.510\nif you will, to control print queues,\nprint queue functionality.\n\n163\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.470\nWhat is that?\n\n164\n00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.410\nAll right, well when you send a print job,\nI have to print this out.\n\n165\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.290\nDan says, can you print that out and\ngive this to me?\n\n166\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.290\nGive this piece of paper to me.\n\n167\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.790\nWell I've got to send this\nelectronic format to a printer.\n\n168\n00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.870\nAll right, well it gets stored\nelectronically in something\n\n169\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.525\nknown as a queue.\n\n170\n00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:36.630\nAnd the print server if you will,\nmanages, okay, you're next, all right?\n\n171\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.380\nI sent that job to the printer,\nDan sends one before I do.\n\n172\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.140\nWho wins out?\n\n173\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.988\nWell, it depends on how it\nhits the print queue and\n\n174\n00:09:43.988 --> 00:09:45.473\nit depends on how the server manages it.\n\n175\n00:09:45.473 --> 00:09:49.991\nSo managing a single location in which\nyou can manage all of your printers,\n\n176\n00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:51.580\nlike you could see here.\n\n177\n00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.100\nWe've got quite a few here.\n\n178\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.060\nNow, we've also got what\nare known as virtual printers.\n\n179\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.340\nDon't let that confuse you, right?\n\n180\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.930\nXPS Document Writer, that's actually what\nthey call a virtual printer, if you will.\n\n181\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.810\nIt doesn't really exist.\n\n182\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.120\nIt takes electronic text and dumps it\nright out to a certain file format, right?\n\n183\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.427\nYou also have PDF-based virtual printers,\nright?\n\n184\n00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:14.114\nWhen we say print to PDF, you could send\na PDF physically to a printer, but what we\n\n185\n00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:19.736\nare saying is, we got a text document and\nwe need to turn that into a PDF, right?\n\n186\n00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:22.800\nA Portable Document Format,\nI think it's what it's called, right?\n\n187\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.040\nAnd what it allows me to do essentially is\ntake that text and dump it into a file,\n\n188\n00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.260\nso there is virtual printers too.\n\n189\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.370\nAnd we also have the ability\nto manage the print queues,\n\n190\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.950\nagain, it's just think about a wait\nin line type mentality, right?\n\n191\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.150\nI send a job that I need to print to the\nprinter, Dan sends a job, our other hosts,\n\n192\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.220\nthey send jobs there.\n\n193\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.930\nOur sales, if you will, they send,\nright, our career concierge,\n\n194\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.960\nthey end up sending print jobs.\n\n195\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.440\nAnd the print queue is pretty\nmuch first come, first serve.\n\n196\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.740\nBut there are times in which we might\nwant to manipulate that, right?\n\n197\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.930\nWe might say, hey okay, I see that\nWes just sent an 800 page document,\n\n198\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.760\nDan's got a one page document and\nhe needs to get that out now.\n\n199\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.530\nWell what I can do is,\nI can go in here and I can pause, right?\n\n200\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.020\nI don't have anything in\nthe print job right now, but\n\n201\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.260\nI could pause the printing of\na single print job in the queue.\n\n202\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.270\nAnd we can let Dan print\nthat print job out now.\n\n203\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.930\nGet that document out, right?\n\n204\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.580\nGet that document out right now, so\n\n205\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.360\nyou don't have to wait on my 800\npage novel that I'm printing, right?\n\n206\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.930\nWe can also look at\nthe properties of printers, right?\n\n207\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.310\nWe can manage the different\nindividual properties, right.\n\n208\n00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.220\nWe could print test pages.\n\n209\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.220\nWe can manage the print preferences,\nright,\n\n210\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.830\nhow we want to the arrangement to be and\nstuff, the paper quality.\n\n211\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.323\nHere's another great thing about these,\nright.\n\n212\n00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:48.084\nI want you to know that,\nnot only can we do that, but\n\n213\n00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:50.570\nnotice the print drivers\nthat we have here.\n\n214\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.310\nLet's see if it will actually show me,\nthere we go.\n\n215\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.080\nYeah, it will show us some of these.\n\n216\n00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:56.630\nI'm gonna make sure here real quick.\n\n217\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.440\nSometimes they have them,\nsometimes they don't.\n\n218\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.750\nOkay, so we have, oops, there we go.\n\n219\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.570\nIt'll be easier if you\nguys can actually see it.\n\n220\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.983\nWe can manage the print\ndrivers themselves.\n\n221\n00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:13.210\nI can see the driver versions here,\nright on every single print driver, right?\n\n222\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.960\nI can look at the properties of the print\ndriver, I could see its location, right?\n\n223\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.630\nAnd here's another great thing about it,\nright?\n\n224\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.870\nWhen you manage the print drivers,\nthink about this.\n\n225\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.960\nThink about having to go this\nprinter to this printer,\n\n226\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.880\nto this printer to sneakernet.\n\n227\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.407\nBut now I could do it all\nfrom a centralized location.\n\n228\n00:12:28.407 --> 00:12:31.420\nI can manage multiple print servers.\n\n229\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.380\nI can consolidate them to\na single location, right?\n\n230\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.590\nWe can deploy printers as well.\n\n231\n00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.720\nSo this is a great functionality to have\ninside of your administrative tools is\n\n232\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.260\nthat ,Windows gives you by\ndefault built in, again,\n\n233\n00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.780\nthe ability to control multiple printers.\n\n234\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.960\nAnd not just printers,\nprint servers, right?\n\n235\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.192\nBecause you could have and\n\n236\n00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:52.944\nDan,I know you've worked in\na very large organization.\n\n237\n00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:56.367\nIf you have to just guess,\nhow many different physical locations,\n\n238\n00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:58.110\ndo you think, your company has?\n\n239\n00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.043\n&gt;&gt; We have, I could not guess,\nI can tell you we have like 126.\n\n240\n00:13:01.043 --> 00:13:04.072\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of locations, right.\n\n241\n00:13:04.072 --> 00:13:05.533\n&gt;&gt; Physical locations, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So can you imagine,\n\n242\n00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:08.840\nlets just theorize and\nthis is probably not close to true.\n\n243\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.180\nOne printer per location and\n\n244\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.940\nI know that's probably not even close\nto true printers, 160 printers.\n\n245\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.370\nBut now, Dan can look through\na single interface, potentially.\n\n246\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.640\nRight, there's other things\nto keep in mind as well.\n\n247\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.080\nAnd manage every one of those\nprinters from a single location.\n\n248\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.280\nThat's a lot easier than going to\n126 different locations, right?\n\n249\n00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n250\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.990\nAnd you know what's funny is,\nyou look at the Print Management and\n\n251\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.100\nyou say, well, a lot of this I can\ndo from devices and printers, or\n\n252\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.930\nprinters and faxes, or\nwhatever version of Windows you're using.\n\n253\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.920\nAnd I can delete printers, I can set them,\nI can work in the print queue,\n\n254\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.870\nI can do it all from there.\n\n255\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.410\nWhat's the purpose?\n\n256\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.860\nObviously, if we want to do that whole\nconglomeration of, I wanna centralize\n\n257\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.990\nmanagement of the print devices and\nwork as a print server, it works great.\n\n258\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:00.150\nBut even if you're not, it actually works\nbetter than going to devices and printers.\n\n259\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.470\nCuz sometimes, you go to devices and\n\n260\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.910\nprinters, having trouble\nwith this printer.\n\n261\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.480\nYou know what, I'll just start\nfrom scratch, delete the printer,\n\n262\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.050\nunplug it, replug it in with USB.\n\n263\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.880\nThere's the driver,\nit installs, it goes da da da.\n\n264\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.170\nBut you know what,\nsometimes that doesn't work.\n\n265\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.420\nIn real life land,\nthat does not always work.\n\n266\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.241\nYou say, delete printer.\n\n267\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.773\nWhy aren't you deleting, what's going on,\nor it deletes and it disappears and\n\n268\n00:14:21.773 --> 00:14:23.600\nthen it comes right back up.\n\n269\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.400\nWhat is going on, why is this happening?\n\n270\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.570\nI don't know why, but\nwhen you go into Print Management and\n\n271\n00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.100\nyou delete, it's gone,\nit goes away, it disappears.\n\n272\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.885\nAnd so it works better for\n\n273\n00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:39.136\nyou, it has more power built\ninto it some way shape or form.\n\n274\n00:14:39.136 --> 00:14:42.063\nIt's like devices and\nprinters on steroids.\n\n275\n00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:45.312\nSo definitely, when you start\nworking with multiple printers or\n\n276\n00:14:45.312 --> 00:14:49.750\njust printers in general, and you're\nsupporting printers, use Print Management.\n\n277\n00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:54.260\nIt's just a better place to go than to\njumping into just devices and printers.\n\n278\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and we talk about things\nlike print drivers, right?\n\n279\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.610\nWell, there's a take UPD,\ndoes it take PCL?\n\n280\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.810\nDoes it take PPD?\n\n281\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.300\nI don't know.\nDoes it have it installed?\n\n282\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:03.900\nI don't know.\n\n283\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.015\nDo I need to go locally to\nthe interface of that printer and\n\n284\n00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:07.477\nlook at the on-screen display there?\n\n285\n00:15:07.477 --> 00:15:11.060\nNo, I can manage all of that right here,\nright.\n\n286\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.098\nI could deploy the printer,\nand it's a drivers as well.\n\n287\n00:15:15.098 --> 00:15:19.850\nSo really,\nreally good technology in reducing\n\n288\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.340\nthe complexity of a Printer Management,\nour printer administration.\n\n289\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.034\nBecause, that can definitely be one\nthat leads to a higher blood pressure by\n\n290\n00:15:28.034 --> 00:15:29.488\nthe end of the day, for sure.\n\n291\n00:15:29.488 --> 00:15:31.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, great technology to have.\n\n292\n00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:35.480\nAgain, moving on kind of in this\nlist here, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n293\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.643\nWe also have something known,\n\n294\n00:15:36.643 --> 00:15:39.608\nand if we could take a look at my screen\nhere, we'll see one down at the bottom.\n\n295\n00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:44.123\nI know that I'm not going in order in\nwhat we see here inside of administrative\n\n296\n00:15:44.123 --> 00:15:45.865\ntools, we could do that way.\n\n297\n00:15:45.865 --> 00:15:48.538\nBut, we really wanna make sure that\nif you are following along and\n\n298\n00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:51.945\nyou've gone out to CompTIA's website,\nand you've downloaded the objectives,\n\n299\n00:15:51.945 --> 00:15:53.954\nyou can kind of follow\nalong with us here as well.\n\n300\n00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:59.950\nAnd that's the Windows Memory Diagnostic\ntoolkit, all right, or kit if you will.\n\n301\n00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.170\nThe WDM, all right,\n\n302\n00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.400\nWindows Memory Diagnostic,\ndoes exactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n303\n00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.800\nYou, ladies and gentlemen, out there\nare a smart crowd, smart crew, so\n\n304\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.920\nyou could definitely tell what it does.\n\n305\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.300\nBut let me go ahead, get a little\nbit more specific with this and\n\n306\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.810\ntalk about some of the things that\nyou could potentially running\n\n307\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:23.020\nto if you are using this to\ndiagnose memory problems, right.\n\n308\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.380\nFirst of all right, notice that you\nhave two options here, restart now and\n\n309\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.100\ncheck for problems or check for problems\nthe next time I start my computer.\n\n310\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.800\nAll right, so if you're in a help desk\nposition and you think potentially that\n\n311\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.860\nthere is a memory issue on a computer\nthat you are supporting for\n\n312\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.450\nsomething on an end user.\n\n313\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.770\nAll right, this might be one\nof these utilities that is so\n\n314\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.380\nproblematic that you have\nto run it right now, right.\n\n315\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.600\nSomebody that says something,\nfor instance, hey,\n\n316\n00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.520\nI start using my computer, and\nmy computer on for five or ten minutes.\n\n317\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.580\nAfter about five or ten minutes,\nwhat it ends up happening is it\n\n318\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.490\nrestarts the computer,\nit blue screens, restarts, right.\n\n319\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.120\nIt might be a CPU overheat, right,\nit could be a memory issue as well.\n\n320\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.670\nBut it might be something\nthat we're gonna go ahead,\n\n321\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.580\nand we're gonna restart it,\nand we are gonna check it now.\n\n322\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.800\nHowever, that is not always\nfeasible specially for\n\n323\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.950\nthe person that's been working for\n\n324\n00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.140\nthe last four hours on a document that\nthey need to submit by the end of the day.\n\n325\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.100\nSo maybe they can afford\nto stop right now.\n\n326\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.470\nMaybe they say, hey, it just happens when\nI start my computer up in the morning.\n\n327\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.350\nAnd then at the end of the day,\nI don't have that problem.\n\n328\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.740\nSee memory problems and system problems\ninside of your computer are such\n\n329\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.470\na nightmare to troubleshoot because a lot\nof times they're never consistent, right?\n\n330\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.640\nThe random access nature of memory,\nhence the term Random Access Memory.\n\n331\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.760\nMeans that we could be accessing and\n\n332\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.950\nusually are multiple different\nphysical as well as logical.\n\n333\n00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.260\nPhysically in the electronics\nthat are sent\n\n334\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.410\nelectronic impulses if you will that\nare sent to the memory module itself.\n\n335\n00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.550\nLogically in the way that they\nare addressed inside a software.\n\n336\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.180\nSo, both different scenarios,\nphysically or logically,\n\n337\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.250\nwe're accessing different pieces\nof your memory, all right.\n\n338\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.170\nAnd that's why it can be\nsomething that is very,\n\n339\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.210\nit's consistently inconsistently we\nwant to say around here in computing.\n\n340\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.600\nSo you might need to check for\nthe problems next time and\n\n341\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.040\nyou can say, next time I start my\ncomputer, so what does this do?\n\n342\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.240\nAll right, so\nwe've already talked about Task Scheduler.\n\n343\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.350\nRemember, I told you some of\nthe tasks that we looked at.\n\n344\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.280\nTask Scheduler's a way to automate some\nof the day to day routines that you do.\n\n345\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.920\nIt's one of the first ones that we\ntalked about here in Windows tools.\n\n346\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.250\nI told you that some of those\ntasks are automated for you.\n\n347\n00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.860\nOne of the ones I've told you\nthat since Vista's been around\n\n348\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.680\nis the Disk Defragmenter.\n\n349\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.010\nRight, that's a task scheduled\nthat waits for idle time or\n\n350\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.860\ncertain trigger points that says,\nhey, you're not working with your\n\n351\n00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.730\ncomputer right now, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll defragment in the background, so\n\n352\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.700\nwe could take care of it and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n353\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.030\nGreat, out of sight, out of mind.\n\n354\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.100\nA lot of end users don't even know what\nit is or how to do it to begin with.\n\n355\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.830\nSo it helps you out as a help\ndesk support technician.\n\n356\n00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.430\nNow, I also told you that sometimes\nthese can be automatically created for\n\n357\n00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.400\nyou when you are not aware of it.\n\n358\n00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.900\nWell, guess what, when you say check for\n\n359\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.760\nproblems the next time I start my\ncomputer, right, what you do is if you\n\n360\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.250\nchoose this option, it's going to\nsend a task into the task scheduler.\n\n361\n00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.680\nAnd when your boot manager,\n\n362\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.340\nright, the file that starts the boot\nprocess is gonna see this little flag.\n\n363\n00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.620\nAnd it's gonna say, whoa,\nwhoa, whoa, wait a second.\n\n364\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.990\nI shouldn't take the operating system,\n\n365\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.664\nwhat is it, N-T-O-S-K-R-N-L-E-X-E,\nthe kernel.\n\n366\n00:19:22.664 --> 00:19:24.348\nN-T-O-S-K-R-N L.\n\n367\n00:19:24.348 --> 00:19:25.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dot exe.\n\n368\n00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.290\n&gt;&gt; That's fun?\n\n369\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.730\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one right?\n\n370\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the whole kernel right at the boot\n\n371\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.960\nprocess don't throw the kernel in the RAM.\n\n372\n00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.720\nWhy?\n\n373\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.000\nBecause I have to diagnose it, right?\n\n374\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.620\nAnd then it runs this check.\n\n375\n00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.850\nNow there are a couple of different\ntypes of checks that you can do.\n\n376\n00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.130\nIn fact you know what I'm a glutton for\npunishment here.\n\n377\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.710\nLet's go ahead.\n\n378\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.580\nI'm gonna restart the computer and\nwe're gonna start this off right away.\n\n379\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.310\nNow I didn't tell Dan\nabout this before hand.\n\n380\n00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.280\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So we might be doing an air ball here\n\n381\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.820\non camera.\n\n382\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.960\n&gt;&gt; This is the dice roll [LAUGH].\n\n383\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n384\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.850\nBaby needs some new shoes.\n\n385\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.610\nCome on, number seven.\n\n386\n00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.240\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n387\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.970\nlet this machine kind of restart here and\nI'm not honestly sure, there we go,\n\n388\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.150\nokay so\n&gt;&gt; Let me go ahead.\n\n389\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.688\nIt's starting to run, but\n\n390\n00:20:06.688 --> 00:20:11.648\nI wanna do an F1, not, okay, that's what\nI want to do, I want to stop it here.\n\n391\n00:20:11.648 --> 00:20:14.620\nBecause I wanna kinda show you that there\nare a couple of different things that you\n\n392\n00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.770\ncan expect to see here.\n\n393\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:21.290\nLet me see if I can get\nmy zoom in Mac to focus.\n\n394\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:21.900\nThere we go.\n\n395\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.460\nCool.\nRight on the right location.\n\n396\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.300\nOkay, so there's three different types\nof tests that you can do, all right?\n\n397\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.879\nNow it's kind of like BIOS you have to\ndo this with a keyboard you don't get\n\n398\n00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:34.980\na mouse, don't confuse the mouse that you\ncan see there in the background, that's\n\n399\n00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.058\nactually the VMware and my Mac Book here\nI'm virtualizing this operating system.\n\n400\n00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:40.496\nHowever, this is virtually,\n\n401\n00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:43.830\nwhat you would see regardless whether\nit's a physical machine or not.\n\n402\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.643\nAll right,\nthere's three different standards or\n\n403\n00:20:45.643 --> 00:20:47.320\ntest types of testing that you can get.\n\n404\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.810\nAll right, and their basic,\nstandard, extended.\n\n405\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.320\nSo, Wes, I see that.\n\n406\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.480\nBasic is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n407\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.050\nIt's gonna do a quick test to your memory,\nit's gonna say, didn't find anything.\n\n408\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.490\nStandards gonna go a little bit further,\nright?\n\n409\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.140\nAnd in fact, let's go ahead and\nI'll get you guys kinda see.\n\n410\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:10.250\nAnd you do not have to know by any means\nwhat these different tests types mean.\n\n411\n00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.040\nThey're not gonna ask you that on\nthe exam, I don't believe in any way.\n\n412\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.940\nBut you can see that when we\nget into standard, right?\n\n413\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.611\nStandard test include\nall basic test plus and\n\n414\n00:21:20.611 --> 00:21:23.190\nthey may say these additional ones, right?\n\n415\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.080\nSo you can see that it\nadds a little bit more.\n\n416\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.590\nNow the extended test, be careful.\n\n417\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.920\nIf you have 16 gig RAM or\n16 gigs of RAM, 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n418\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.610\nIf you have 32, 64 gigs of RAM.\n\n419\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.126\nYou can be here a long time,\nbecause you're doing a very,\n\n420\n00:21:40.126 --> 00:21:42.050\nvery deep test of the memory.\n\n421\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.876\nNow, notice that it\nalso has the the option\n\n422\n00:21:45.876 --> 00:21:49.980\nto control whether you're going\nto test the cache, all right.\n\n423\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.490\nNow we gonna talk about cache,\nwe're talking about the not\n\n424\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:00.100\nthe Static Random Access Memory that's\nembedded in the CPUs as well, all right,\n\n425\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.920\nbecause it's still a form of memory.\n\n426\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.080\nAnd remember that,\nthat cache memory talks to the CPU,\n\n427\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.260\nthe CPU talks to the Main System Bus,\nwhich sends information in and\n\n428\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.810\nout of main RAM and communication\nbetween the memory controller, right.\n\n429\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.570\nSo, it's gonna be a very,\nvery extended test, right.\n\n430\n00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.060\nAnd also gives you the ability to say,\n\n431\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:21.960\nokay, how in depth do\nI want my pass count?\n\n432\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.320\nRight, how many different times do I want\nto check peak portions of this memory?\n\n433\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.340\nSo get very, very extended and\nit can take a long, long time.\n\n434\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.570\nAll right, so that being said,\nlet's go over here.\n\n435\n00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.970\nAnd I'll show you, if I believe, and\nI don't know that I'm right on this one.\n\n436\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.140\nLike I said,\nwe're shooting from the hip on this one.\n\n437\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.460\nBasic Test, I'll go ahead and run, and\nit really should not take too long here.\n\n438\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.450\nLet's do our F10 to apply and\nit should run through this, actually,\n\n439\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.450\nyou can see it's running\nthrough it pretty fast.\n\n440\n00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:57.402\nHowever, understand, notice that not\nnecessarily is every one of these, so\n\n441\n00:22:57.402 --> 00:23:01.440\ndon't take this top bar as\nbeing the completion, right?\n\n442\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.511\nNotice there's no problems detected,\nright?\n\n443\n00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:07.542\nThe overall test,\nthis is the one I want, right?\n\n444\n00:23:07.542 --> 00:23:09.350\nWhen you see one of 99,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.486\n&gt;&gt; And the overall test says 2% and\n\n446\n00:23:11.486 --> 00:23:16.760\nit's been there for the last two hours,\nit might be something that you have to do.\n\n447\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.860\nI have kind of a love hate\nrelationship with that, but\n\n448\n00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.100\nit is as good as it is guys.\n\n449\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.050\nI pick on things here,\nbut I pick on him for\n\n450\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:28.100\nwhat I feel are valid reasons\nbecause I've had to use them before.\n\n451\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.490\nI kind of have a love hate relationship\nwith that software and here's why.\n\n452\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.322\nI sometimes love to hate it.\n\n453\n00:23:34.322 --> 00:23:39.106\nIt's the fact that when you run it and\nyou do one of this extended tests and\n\n454\n00:23:39.106 --> 00:23:42.950\nit just took four hours to test the RAM,\nat the end it says,\n\n455\n00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.290\ndetected issues with your memory,\ncontact your manufacturer.\n\n456\n00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.233\nThanks.\n\n457\n00:23:49.233 --> 00:23:50.321\n&gt;&gt; Appreciate it.\n\n458\n00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:50.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n459\n00:23:50.927 --> 00:23:54.392\nChances are I was running this because\nI thought there might be a problem with\n\n460\n00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:57.045\nthe memory but at least it says\nthat it did find something,\n\n461\n00:23:57.045 --> 00:23:58.580\nit just doesn't tell you where.\n\n462\n00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.090\nSo be careful with that.\n\n463\n00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.370\nDan and I have kinda gone back and\nforth on this one.\n\n464\n00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.080\nYou made a valid point when we're talking\nabout our memory in the hardware section\n\n465\n00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.910\nyou know, I say if you're gonna diagnose\nthe memory pop out one stick, test it.\n\n466\n00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.200\nIf it takes, good, that's fine.\n\n467\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.640\nMark it as good and\nthen go through your ram modules.\n\n468\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.090\nIf I remember right you had a valid\npoint you said well with memory being so\n\n469\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.320\ncheap wouldn't it just be faster,\nwhat would you say?\n\n470\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:22.970\nHow did [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n471\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.400\nI see it's not a cost effective solution\nto actually to, how much are you paying to\n\n472\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.160\nme spend take the time to test this RAM\nversus how much this just new RAM cost?\n\n473\n00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.890\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n474\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.350\nAnd then what we, what we,\n\n475\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:39.590\nthe solution kinda where we both agreed\non is it really is the cost, right?\n\n476\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.000\nIn a situation where you\nwork with a corporation.\n\n477\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.040\nIf it takes more than 15 minutes, than it\nmight be cheaper just to replace the RAM,\n\n478\n00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.710\nI think was your point there and\nit's a great valid point.\n\n479\n00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.650\nIf you're a home user and you can't\nafford next week's paycheck [LAUGH] well,\n\n480\n00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.780\nyou might wanna go through it.\n\n481\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.634\n&gt;&gt; He might be willing to trade\nright through that testing cycle.\n\n482\n00:24:57.634 --> 00:25:02.381\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and very valid points\nbecause we've talked about in other\n\n483\n00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:07.129\nepisodes and other shows that we've\ndone that sometimes corporations and\n\n484\n00:25:07.129 --> 00:25:10.310\nI know one of the companies\nthat I work for.\n\n485\n00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.540\nYou test it and if you can't diagnose\nthe problem within an operating system\n\n486\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.250\nwithin about five minutes or so.\n\n487\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.140\nWe just reformat it and we put in\nan operating system with an image that's\n\n488\n00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.930\nalready created and we go on with\nit we'd be done with our day.\n\n489\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.110\nAnd we just actually saved the company\nmore money than what it would have cost\n\n490\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.630\nlike Dan mentioned with the memory test\nper hour to pay me to sit there and\n\n491\n00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.065\nwait for a progress bar to finish.\n\n492\n00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:31.270\nAnd we could be doing\nmore productive things.\n\n493\n00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:36.790\nAgain, all great things to have and\nif we could back to my screen here.\n\n494\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.480\nI wanna show you.\n\n495\n00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.580\nMy head's kinda covering it up this one.\n\n496\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.000\nThank goodness this one doesn't disappear.\n\n497\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes these little thought\n\n498\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.480\nbubbles disappear.\n\n499\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.017\nKinda like my memory [LAUGH].\n\n500\n00:25:45.017 --> 00:25:46.700\nAnd let's see here.\n\n501\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.530\nMaybe I just made it disappear.\n\n502\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.930\n&gt;&gt; I think you did.\n[LAUGH]\n\n503\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:50.825\n&gt;&gt; Apparently I did.\n\n504\n00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:52.539\nI was good.\nI thought I was gonna show you guys but\n\n505\n00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:53.650\napparently it can't remember.\n\n506\n00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.211\nAnyways, It'll let you\nknow that no memory,\n\n507\n00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:58.980\nthere weren't any problems\nthat were detected.\n\n508\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.500\nAnd one of the great things about\nit is if it does detect something,\n\n509\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.960\nit'll tell you in which area of the test.\n\n510\n00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.720\nIt'll give you this readout and\nyou can print that out if you want to.\n\n511\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.740\nAnd it'll give you exactly,\nmaybe not exactly, what's wrong with it.\n\n512\n00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.950\nBut the test in which they found problems,\nright?\n\n513\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.652\nAnd you could potentially use that for\nmaybe warranty purposes and you know,\n\n514\n00:26:20.652 --> 00:26:25.340\nbecause sometimes if you've got a piece\nof memory that's under warranty,\n\n515\n00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.810\nthey'll say, \"Well, did you do this?\n\n516\n00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:27.430\nDid you do this?\n\n517\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.615\nDid you this and you could say,\n\n518\n00:26:28.615 --> 00:26:32.065\nyeah if I'm under a warranty I got\nsome kind of support contract, right?\n\n519\n00:26:32.065 --> 00:26:35.865\nYou could say I did this,\nit hit this test and here's the problem.\n\n520\n00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:38.265\nDo you have to actually know\nthe inner workings of that test or\n\n521\n00:26:38.265 --> 00:26:40.625\nwhat's going on electronically\nwith the RAM, no, but\n\n522\n00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:45.270\nyou can at least give somebody that's\non the other hand, that's on the phone,\n\n523\n00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.930\nthe ability to say okay, well, obviously\nthere's something wrong with the RAM.\n\n524\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.280\nWe'll go ahead and we'll expedite out some\nnew RAM since it's still under warranty.\n\n525\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.930\nSo great things that can happen there,\ntoo, as well.\n\n526\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.420\nAnd definitely save your company from\nhaving to pay because somebody actually\n\n527\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:03.190\ndamaged the RAM on their part versus\nthe manufacturer's failure to give you\n\n528\n00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.482\na good product, I guess.\n\n529\n00:27:04.482 --> 00:27:06.270\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n530\n00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.790\nI know we're coming to the end here,\nDan, of yet another one.\n\n531\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.810\nBut I do wanna kind of just talk\nabout one that we've really already\n\n532\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.000\nmentioned, right?\n\n533\n00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.420\nIn that we mention the Windows\nfirewall earlier on,\n\n534\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.950\nand we talked a little bit about it.\n\n535\n00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.100\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's go back to the Windows firewall, and\n\n536\n00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.610\nI wanna show you guys real quick.\n\n537\n00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.810\nWe're not gonna spend too much\ntime on the firewall itself\n\n538\n00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.800\nbecause we've already\nhit that pretty good.\n\n539\n00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.740\nWe've talked about that and\nwe've talked about the ability\n\n540\n00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.170\nto allow an application to communicate\nthrough the firewall, if you will.\n\n541\n00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.140\nI think we gave the example\nlike remote desktop in\n\n542\n00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.110\nour Windows features, all right?\n\n543\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.350\nThis is very basic,\n\n544\n00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.320\nwhat this allows me to do is see\nthe current state of the application,\n\n545\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.570\nthe Windows Firewall, change notification\nsettings if you will, turn it on or off,\n\n546\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:51.810\nand again just very basically allow\nan application to communicate.\n\n547\n00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.920\nOne of the things I said in an earlier\nepisode is I said there's also advanced\n\n548\n00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.760\nsettings, and we would talk\nabout that in a later episode.\n\n549\n00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.190\nWell, that later episode is now.\n\n550\n00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.560\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\n\n551\n00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.650\nlet's talk real briefly about Windows\nfirewall with advanced security.\n\n552\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.350\nNow you might be saying, well, Wes,\nwhy are you talking real briefly?\n\n553\n00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.410\nYou trying to hurry us through this.\n\n554\n00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.700\nNo I'm not.\n\n555\n00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.210\nYou could get very, very granular and\nhere's what I really think you need to\n\n556\n00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.170\nknow for the exam when it comes to\nWindows firewall with advanced security.\n\n557\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.400\nWe could have a whole entire mini series.\n\n558\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.390\n&gt;&gt; Series.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n559\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.410\nAbsolutely.\n\n560\n00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.318\nOn just the Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n561\n00:28:24.318 --> 00:28:25.970\nIn fact, Dan, I know in other episodes,\n\n562\n00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.470\nI think you've done an episodes\non things like IP tables.\n\n563\n00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.775\nSo firewalls get very complex.\n\n564\n00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:33.297\nRight?\nEven this one isn't as complex as some of\n\n565\n00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:35.880\nthe firewalls that you see\nout there on the market.\n\n566\n00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.880\nBut what it allows you to do?\n\n567\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.770\nIs it the basic firewall that you've\nseen doesn't give you the functionality,\n\n568\n00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.560\ndoesn't give you the granular\ncontrol you need,\n\n569\n00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.040\nyou launch up Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n570\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.510\nCuz not only can you control which\napplications can communicate inbound,\n\n571\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.310\nthrough the firewall.\n\n572\n00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.290\nYou can also create additional rules, and\n\n573\n00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:00.930\nwhen you create additional rules you\ncan specify a lot more information.\n\n574\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:05.230\nThinks like programs,\nports, customize these.\n\n575\n00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.900\nLet's just kind of walk through\nthis wizard real quick, right?\n\n576\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.220\nI can say hey where's this?\n\n577\n00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.010\nIs this applied to all programs?\n\n578\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.640\nSpecific program, I'll just go ahead and\napply it to all programs, right?\n\n579\n00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.330\nI can allow or block the connection.\n\n580\n00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.840\nI could even go a little bit farther and\nsaying, hey its gotta be scrambled,\n\n581\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.340\nits gotta be encrypted, right?\n\n582\n00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.695\nSo that being said I can get very,\nvery specific with the inbound rules,\n\n583\n00:29:25.695 --> 00:29:27.625\nbut even more so.\n\n584\n00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:29.965\nI can create Outbound Rules.\n\n585\n00:29:29.965 --> 00:29:34.095\nI can control and define how\nthe communication goes from my computer\n\n586\n00:29:34.095 --> 00:29:39.230\nto another one wherein the basic firewall,\nall outbound communication is allowed.\n\n587\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.710\nThat in a very strict security sense might\nnot be something that you could afford.\n\n588\n00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.520\nThen we can go even farther,\nwe can do things like IP sec,\n\n589\n00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.130\nInternet Protocol Security, and\nget really, really advanced.\n\n590\n00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.210\nAnd it's not something you\nhave to worry for the exam.\n\n591\n00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.400\nBut then we also get the ability\nto monitor the different profiles,\n\n592\n00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.420\nwhich is the overall configuration\n\n593\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.270\nof the firewall related to what type\nof network you're connected to,\n\n594\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:06.940\nas well as seeing some of those more\nsecure settings that you can do, right?\n\n595\n00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.850\nGreat thing to have.\n\n596\n00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:13.580\nAgain, you can see all of the rules,\nwhether they're turned on or turned off.\n\n597\n00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.690\nAnd again, just get a lot of\ndetailed information about it.\n\n598\n00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.420\nThat really is your Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n599\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:25.627\nYou might see it another acronym,\nyou might see it called WFAS.\n\n600\n00:30:25.627 --> 00:30:28.190\nDon't let that confuse you in\nthe documentations of your study.\n\n601\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.270\nWindows Firewall with Advanced Security\nis what that acronym is.\n\n602\n00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.370\nThat's a little bit about it.\n\n603\n00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.660\nAgain, keep in mind just very\nvery fine grain control.\n\n604\n00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.710\nBasic firewall if you will for\nyour home users or\n\n605\n00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.300\neven basic SOHO is probably\nas good as you really need.\n\n606\n00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.240\nDon't turn it off, use a firewall,\nthat's one thing we wanna say.\n\n607\n00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.070\nWhether you're using the basic firewall or\n\n608\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.550\nthe advanced firewall,\nmake sure you're using at least one.\n\n609\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.370\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the Windows firewall\nis actually a really good firewall.\n\n610\n00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:01.746\nSo don't think just because, that's for my\ndesktop operation, there's nothing there.\n\n611\n00:31:01.746 --> 00:31:05.723\nDoes a really good blocking\nthings in as Wes alluded to.\n\n612\n00:31:05.723 --> 00:31:11.282\nYou can get really in-depth with it, and\ntake some really fine control over it,\n\n613\n00:31:11.282 --> 00:31:17.050\nand really talk about, hm, do I wanna\nallow this, do I wanna not allow that?\n\n614\n00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.340\nIt has a lot of power behind it.\n\n615\n00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.910\nBut for\nthe intensive purposes of the exam,\n\n616\n00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.050\nyou just have to be kind\nof familiar with this.\n\n617\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.310\nSo that being said, Wes,\nwe are out of time for this episode but\n\n618\n00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.270\nI know there are still more\nhits to come so join us then.\n\n619\n00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.399\nAs for this episode we're gonna\ngo ahead and call it a day.\n\n620\n00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:35.206\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n621\n00:31:35.206 --> 00:31:36.232\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n622\n00:31:36.232 --> 00:31:37.570\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n623\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:44.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n624\n00:31:44.062 --> 00:31:47.160\n&gt;&gt; Thank you or watching

00:00:08.363\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:10.933\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.213\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:16.720\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.700\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.830\ntoday's episode where when continuing\non with more on a A+ software series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.860\nThe 22902 for those of you keeping score,\nand joining us back in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.000\nlending his expertise, filling our brains\nwith the knowledge that he possesses,\n\n11\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.190\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.970\nWes, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.850\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going good.\n\n14\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.990\nLooking to hopefully wrap this one up.\n\n15\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.100\nI know we're in a many,\nmany part series here.\n\n16\n00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.140\nSo [LAUGH] well as you ladies and\ngentleman have seen out there,\n\n17\n00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.280\nthere are quite a few tools.\n\n18\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.090\nAnd we wanted to make sure,\n\n19\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.090\nwell, that you have a decent\nunderstanding of each one of those tools.\n\n20\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.910\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n21\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.770\nwe're gonna continue right where we or\npick up right where we left off.\n\n22\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.508\nAnd we kind of briefly showed you the next\nutility that we're gonna talk about cuz\n\n23\n00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:05.107\nthere was a big change in MSConfig or\nsystem configuration utility that Dan and\n\n24\n00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:07.704\nI had mentioned in\nthe previous part there.\n\n25\n00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:11.995\nWhere we had said that startup tab right,\nthe start up tab no longer contains,\n\n26\n00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:15.376\nif you will those start up\napplications and it had moved over,\n\n27\n00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:19.820\nto something known as Task Manager, so\nthat's where we're gonna start today.\n\n28\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.400\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet me get logged in here,\n\n29\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.290\nprobably should've done that\nbefore we started here.\n\n30\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.250\nLogged into my Windows 7 machine and\nthere are a couple of different\n\n31\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.480\nplaces that really you could find this,\nif you wanted to launch it up.\n\n32\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.810\nOne of the easiest ways\nto find Task Manager and\n\n33\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.780\nit doesn't matter if you're in Vista,\nWindows 7.\n\n34\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.070\nA little bit different if\nyou're in Windows 8 and 8.1 but\n\n35\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.360\nwe can right click on the Task Bar and\nwe can choose Start Task Manager.\n\n36\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.885\nI say a little bit different than with\nWindows 8.1 because remember that Windows\n\n37\n00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:57.660\n8.1 does have the start screen here,\nthe metro slash modern UI, if you will.\n\n38\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.530\nAnd really you could type task\nfrom the start screen here or\n\n39\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.740\nyou could go to the desktop and\nthen you could see by right clicking,\n\n40\n00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.050\nyou could choose Task Manager.\n\n41\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.740\nI can't remember, and you can also right\nclick on the little Windows tile there and\n\n42\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.110\nchoose Task Manager here.\n\n43\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.610\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nwe'll come back to the one in Windows 8.1.\n\n44\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.350\nAnd the reason I say that is\nbecause it is a little bit\n\n45\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.180\ndifferent in the ones that you will\nsee in Vista and Windows 7 which and\n\n46\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.240\nreally even going back\nto an operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.360\nWe really don't see anymore at all.\n\n48\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.610\nXP is still kinda out there but\n\n49\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.620\neven Windows 2000 Professional had Task\nManager that largely hasn't change, didn't\n\n50\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.440\nchange too much up until the point when we\nget to Windows 8 and then 8.1 and beyond.\n\n51\n00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.030\nAll right, so Task Manager what is it?\n\n52\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.360\nWell it is a very quick easy breezy\nif you will, application that allows\n\n53\n00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.090\nyou to see performance information and\nuse it for troubleshooting if you will.\n\n54\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.052\nJust real, quick high level-\n&gt;&gt; Thought you were going to say it was\n\n55\n00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:01.510\na beautiful cover girl [LAUGH].\n\n56\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.370\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no,\nif it is I missed [INAUDIBLE] for sure.\n\n57\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n58\n00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:08.050\nyou can see it's a real simplistic\ndiagnostic utility that we have and\n\n59\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.940\nthere are a couple of different\ntabs here along the top.\n\n60\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.380\nA lot of things you really can get really\ninto this and do a lot with it but\n\n61\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.190\nvery basically, you'll see a few\ntabs here for Task Manager, right?\n\n62\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.290\nApplications, Processes, Services,\nPerformance, Networking and Users.\n\n63\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.820\nAnd this is what it looked like for\na very long time, right.\n\n64\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.402\nThis is what we would see.\n\n65\n00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:34.760\nAnd Applications, one of the things I\nlike to use this for is if you start\n\n66\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.360\nan application becomes problematic in any\nway and maybe you need to close it down.\n\n67\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.660\nWell, you could do that right?\n\n68\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.190\nIf you have an application hang and it\nfreezes, and it's not gonna do anything.\n\n69\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.970\nToday, Windows is pretty good at saying,\nhey, application's not responding.\n\n70\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.540\nDo you want to close the application?\n\n71\n00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.470\nIt does kinda like a task kill and\nit will shut the process down.\n\n72\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.740\nBut if that doesn't happen, you can always\ncome in here to the Applications tab.\n\n73\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.510\nAnd select the appropriate application and\nright here we could choose End Task.\n\n74\n00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.810\nAnd as you can see,\n\n75\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.700\nI no longer have command prompt\nrunning on the task bar right?\n\n76\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.405\nSo great thing to do there.\n\n77\n00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:14.920\nProcesses tabs gives you all the processes\nthat are running in the background.\n\n78\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.840\nKeep in mind that a process is a little\nbit different than an application and\n\n79\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.890\nwell even really more so than a service.\n\n80\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.930\nBecause it doesn't necessarily, a process\ndoesn't have to have a graphical user\n\n81\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.740\ninterface or really any kind of UI\nif you will, user interface at all.\n\n82\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.480\nFor instance winlogon.exe and\nthat's how we log onto the machine, right?\n\n83\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.590\nYou can see other things, too.\n\n84\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.888\nNow, the task manager, it's an executable,\nit's a program that's running and\n\n85\n00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:41.640\nI can actually see it right here.\n\n86\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.900\nAnd if I wanted to for any reason,\nI could also end the process right here.\n\n87\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.320\nHowever, I will tell you be very,\nvery careful in ending processes here.\n\n88\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.920\nAnd let me give you an example, right?\n\n89\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.047\nThis one right here is\nthe desktop windows manager, and\n\n90\n00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:54.778\nI believe if we look at\nthe description here.\n\n91\n00:04:54.778 --> 00:05:02.220\nWe should see that fact, if I right\nclick on this I can choose Properties.\n\n92\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.000\nI believe that what it,\nwell you can see that underlying, right,\n\n93\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.610\nthe application is in Windows Explorer.\n\n94\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.360\nThis is what's showing my desktop.\n\n95\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.876\nMore specifically, DWM there,\nI believe is the desktop windows manager.\n\n96\n00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:16.240\nThis is rendering [LAUGH] my desktop and\nyou can only imagine\n\n97\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.890\nthat if I was to right click on this and\nI was to end that process, well.\n\n98\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.000\nMight make for\na very short part five here [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.916\n&gt;&gt; We can do it [LAUGH].\n\n100\n00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:24.090\n&gt;&gt; We can, that's right.\n\n101\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.150\nBut we can also look at things,\nlike the property.\n\n102\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.210\nWe can go to the services here as well.\n\n103\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.030\nWe could open the file location.\n\n104\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.270\nSo much like Dan was talking about,\nwhen we mentioned MSConfig and\n\n105\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.200\nhim using that to troubleshoot\nthings like viruses.\n\n106\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.780\nSometimes they don't show\nup in the start up and\n\n107\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.340\nthey don't show up here in applications.\n\n108\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.600\nCuz again they don't have\na direct user interface.\n\n109\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.660\nThey don't want [LAUGH] you to interact or\ninterface with their virus, right.\n\n110\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.750\nBut I could potentially use the Processes\ntab in here come here and find it.\n\n111\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.620\nFind out where it's located and\nthen kill it.\n\n112\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.301\n&gt;&gt; Now West, we were kind of joking\naround about killing the explorer.exe.\n\n113\n00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:59.799\nThat actually is a valid thing that you\nmight have to do from time to time.\n\n114\n00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:04.227\nAnd if I'm not mistaken it will just\nthere's like a scheduler that looks and\n\n115\n00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:07.940\nsees if explorer is running on\nit on some version of Windows.\n\n116\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.000\nYou kill it, it does kill the service, and\n\n117\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.800\nthen it will start again\nvery shortly after.\n\n118\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.450\nSo that could be a good possibility.\n\n119\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.090\nIf it doesn't, you can use\n\n120\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.492\nthere's a run utility from Task Manager\njust explore.exe and it will fire back up.\n\n121\n00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:24.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's back where that\none command where we were talking\n\n122\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.366\nto some of our viewers in chat\nnet you had mentioned, right.\n\n123\n00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nNet will start that service back up\n\n124\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.770\ntoo if it happens and Windows is\nvery good at protecting itself even\n\n125\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.170\nthough we joke around here,\nWindows, they really programmed it.\n\n126\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.270\nWindows knows how to protect,\n\n127\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.170\na lot of the operating systems\nknow how to protect themselves.\n\n128\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.739\nAnd this is what Dan was kind of alluding\nto here is that it'll detect the fact that\n\n129\n00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:47.697\nexplorer.exe isn't working, and the fact\nthat you don't have a command prompt open.\n\n130\n00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:51.090\nAnd a lot of times it'll trigger that\nservice to come back on automatically.\n\n131\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.170\nBut that being said, explorer should be\nrunning from a certain location, right?\n\n132\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.400\nSo I should be able to right click on\nthe Processes tab and I should be able\n\n133\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.230\nto Open File Location and notice that this\nis running from the Windows folder, right?\n\n134\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.020\nIf I happen to run this and\nI look in here, right and I see\n\n135\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.950\nthat it's running from the user profile,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.926\n&gt;&gt; Let's say,\n\n137\n00:07:13.926 --> 00:07:17.126\nlet me change this little view right here.\n\n138\n00:07:17.126 --> 00:07:19.640\nLet's show some hidden files and\nfolders right?\n\n139\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.220\nAnd I come in here and\nI notice that it's from App Data, Local.\n\n140\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.130\nAnd it's running from the temporary\ndirectory in the user profile right?\n\n141\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.070\nChances are that's not explore.exe,\nI don't care what it says,\n\n142\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.610\nit's probably some kind of virus.\n\n143\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.480\nSo, very valid point there.\n\n144\n00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.950\nI'm glad you brought it up.\n\n145\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.850\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI want to talk about and\n\n146\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.040\nthey don't really have this here.\n\n147\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.021\nWe'll get back to details in a second\ncause again you're gonna see an 8.1,\n\n148\n00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:43.705\nit's a little bit different 8 and 8.1.\n\n149\n00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:47.837\nServices, just like another place [LAUGH]\nDan mentioned this in one of the parts\n\n150\n00:07:47.837 --> 00:07:49.100\nhere in Windows tools.\n\n151\n00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.923\nThere's like seven different ways\nyou can go and find your services.\n\n152\n00:07:51.923 --> 00:07:53.561\nThis is another one of those ways.\n\n153\n00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:57.727\nPerformance shows you your CPU\nutilization, memory utilization, right.\n\n154\n00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:02.598\nAs well as memory too and then finally,\nyour networking bandwidth if you will,\n\n155\n00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:05.590\nthe adapter and\nthe total network utilization.\n\n156\n00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.180\n&gt;&gt; It's like a baby perf mom.\n\n157\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.870\n&gt;&gt; It really is yeah, it really is.\n\n158\n00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.029\nIt's close to for instance,\nlike the resource monitor if you will.\n\n159\n00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:14.533\nAnd with the fact that\nwe've got gigabit speeds,\n\n160\n00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:18.529\na lot of these adapters aren't really\nfunctioning, sending a gigabit speed so\n\n161\n00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:22.065\nthe amount of information you see\nhere is really relative to how fast.\n\n162\n00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:25.775\nAnd how much communication you\nhave going on at one time.\n\n163\n00:08:25.775 --> 00:08:30.155\nThen we finally see users and the users\ntab here allows me to disconnect users who\n\n164\n00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:33.600\nare maybe logged into the machine and\nare no longer logged in.\n\n165\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.100\nI know this has happened in other\ncompanies that I've worked at where you've\n\n166\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.920\nhad 15 people logged into the same machine\nall under their own user account, and\n\n167\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.410\nthey've locked the machine and\nwalked away.\n\n168\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.873\nAnd now keep in mind that even though\nthey're not currently logged into\n\n169\n00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:49.797\nthe machine, Windows is saving those\nresources for those logged in sessions and\n\n170\n00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:51.836\nI can log them off completely if you will.\n\n171\n00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:55.112\nHowever, if there's only a single\nperson and you log them off,\n\n172\n00:08:55.112 --> 00:08:56.930\nyou're gonna log yourself out.\n\n173\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.670\nSo [LAUGH] be careful there.\n\n174\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.710\nNow that being said,\nlet's move over to Windows 8.1.\n\n175\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:07.160\nAnd one of the things I love about with\nthey gave Task Manager such a good\n\n176\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.460\nUpdate right?\n\n177\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.560\n&gt;&gt; A face lift if you will.\n\n178\n00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.660\n&gt;&gt; It really is a face lift\ncuz I've mentioned time and\n\n179\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.510\ntime again where hey Microsoft\ngive something a new paint job and\n\n180\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.990\nthey rename it a old\ntechnology something new.\n\n181\n00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.750\nWell this is one they've done and\nthey've done an amazing job.\n\n182\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.320\nI got to give them props out there.\n\n183\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.643\nProcesses tab,\nit's a lot the same thing but\n\n184\n00:09:24.643 --> 00:09:28.250\nnow instead of exploring the process\ntree I could kind of see things and\n\n185\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.266\nservices that are related to\nthese different processes.\n\n186\n00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.726\nAnd this is what I was going to mention,\n\n187\n00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:38.798\nit wasn't in the earlier one notice the\nDetails right, I was going to say let me\n\n188\n00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:43.739\ngo, wait that's right that's an 8,\n8.1 Details is a little bit more.\n\n189\n00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:46.309\nProcesses and Details are almost the same.\n\n190\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.890\nNotice that with Processes it\ngives me more of this visual,\n\n191\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.180\nuser friendly visualization if you will.\n\n192\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.540\nDetails doesn't do that.\n\n193\n00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.600\nIt gives me everything, right?\n\n194\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.040\nA lot of hence details.\n\n195\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.790\n&gt;&gt; Details [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; A lot of detailed information.\n\n196\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.080\nA lot more verbose, if you will.\n\n197\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.690\nAnd it doesn't break them\ndown into their process tree.\n\n198\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.240\nHere's one of the other\nthings that I like about it.\n\n199\n00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.460\nYou'll notice we got nice,\npretty interface here for Performance.\n\n200\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.560\nNotice that we don't have a separation\non performance and networking anymore,\n\n201\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.360\nbecause guess what?\n\n202\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.840\nPerformance, it's based\non networking as well.\n\n203\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.870\nSo it's all in one location and you could\nsee multiple wireless technologies.\n\n204\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.830\nSo I have an Ethernet wired adapter,\nI have wireless communication going on.\n\n205\n00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.410\nAnd I happen to have Bluetooth turned on.\n\n206\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.330\nGuess what, everything's right here.\n\n207\n00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.440\nSo really, really good thing to have.\n\n208\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.317\nApplication history, this is something\nthat's unique to Windows 8, and\n\n209\n00:10:38.317 --> 00:10:40.740\nWindows 8.1, and later on in Windows 10.\n\n210\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.120\nBecause now this shows me the utilization\nof the Windows Store Apps.\n\n211\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.113\nAnd again, those are unique, Windows Store\nintegrating those applications didn't\n\n212\n00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:49.019\nhappen until Windows 8.\n\n213\n00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.189\nHence why you see it in Windows 8 and\nbeyond and\n\n214\n00:10:51.189 --> 00:10:53.795\nyou didn't see it in Windows 7 and prior.\n\n215\n00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:56.100\nStartup is the same way ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n216\n00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.890\nI want you to keep mind that that is\nsomething that is new to Windows 8.1 they\n\n217\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.980\ntook it out of msconfig, system\nconfiguration, and they put it right here.\n\n218\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.410\nUsers is the same thing that\nwe've talked in the other one,\n\n219\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.350\nlooks a little bit different.\n\n220\n00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.782\nKind of breaks down what the resources,\nthe four horsemen as I like to call it.\n\n221\n00:11:11.782 --> 00:11:15.890\nWe have CPU, Memory, Disk and\nNetwork utilization as well.\n\n222\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.150\nDetails is the detailed version of\nthe Processes tab, if you will.\n\n223\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.890\nAnd then Services is just like\nit has been in the past, right?\n\n224\n00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.250\nSo we could also launch the services\nconsole that we talked about before here\n\n225\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.525\nas well, if we wanted to.\n\n226\n00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:33.127\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about your Task Manager.\n\n227\n00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:36.965\nNow, there's another great\nutility that we have inside of\n\n228\n00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:39.045\nour Windows operating system.\n\n229\n00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:40.335\nThis one's been around for a while.\n\n230\n00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:43.445\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna launch\nthis from the Windows 7 console.\n\n231\n00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:48.601\nAgain, if we go ahead and\npush Start &gt; Control Panel\n\n232\n00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:53.540\n&gt; System and\nSecurity &gt; Administrative Tools.\n\n233\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.190\nYou will not see this\nadministrative tools but\n\n234\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.090\nwhat you will do,\nsee this in this Computer Management.\n\n235\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.030\nIt's one of the reasons I went here.\n\n236\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.080\nBe careful on the exam cuz they might\nask you to find the location of\n\n237\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.590\nDisk Management and you would think\nbecause we're talking about the context\n\n238\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.260\nAdministrative Tools, that you would\nfind it in Administrative Tools.\n\n239\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.830\nAnd that is kind of right but\nkinda not the whole story.\n\n240\n00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.640\nCuz it's actually something that\nyou can see in Computer Management.\n\n241\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.980\nAll right, so\nI'm talking about Disk Management.\n\n242\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.705\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch up Disk Management here.\n\n243\n00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:24.865\nHere and we'll look and\nwe wanna talk a little bit about,\n\n244\n00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:27.810\nsome of the things that you have to be\naware of when it comes to Disk Management.\n\n245\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.695\nDisk Management does exactly that,\nit's about adding drive, right?\n\n246\n00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:37.415\nAdd a hard drive to a machine,\nI have to get that hard drive conditioned\n\n247\n00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:42.275\nif you will, to accept files, to be able\nto used it, we call it formatting, right?\n\n248\n00:12:42.275 --> 00:12:47.350\nWell, if I format a drive,\nessentially what I do is I'm\n\n249\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.280\napplying a logical structure to it\nthat puts a file system on, and\n\n250\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.130\nit allows me to interact with the hard\ndrive story files and folders.\n\n251\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.410\nHowever, that's not the only thing\nthat you have to do to format a drive.\n\n252\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.260\nTo format a drive, you also have\nto have your operating system even\n\n253\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.980\nrecognize that it's a [LAUGH]\ndrive to begin with, right?\n\n254\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.380\nSo there's a couple of things that go on,\nright?\n\n255\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.950\nSo when I add a drive,\nlike you can see it has done here,\n\n256\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.840\nthere's a couple of I don't know,\n\n257\n00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.810\nyour pre requisites that your operating\nsystem does to the drive, if you will.\n\n258\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.520\nSo for instance,\none of things that you might have to\n\n259\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.050\ndo when you add a drive is\ninitialize a disk, right?\n\n260\n00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.450\nInitializing, they do call out.\n\n261\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.070\nWhat is initializing?\n\n262\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.860\nWhen you first add a drive, there's\nthree things that this operating system\n\n263\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.320\nhas to do to use that hard drive in\nthe initialization process, right?\n\n264\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.800\nIt initializes it by writing a disk\nsignature directly to the drive, right?\n\n265\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.940\nThis is a way to uniquely\nidentify the drive.\n\n266\n00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.810\nAll right, because one of the things they\ntalk about in the exam here is they talk\n\n267\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.170\nabout adding and changing drive letters.\n\n268\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.670\nThose drive letters aren't unique enough,\nall right.\n\n269\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.560\nAnd that could cause a problem.\n\n270\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.230\nSo when it writes a disk signature,\nit typically uses,\n\n271\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.210\nwhat's known as, it depends on what\noperating system you're looking at.\n\n272\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.815\nIf you're looking at\nsome operating systems,\n\n273\n00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:08.200\nthey'll call it a universally\nunique identifier,\n\n274\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.620\na UUID Microsoft because there's\na globally unique identifier.\n\n275\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.690\nAnd it's a big long string of information\n\n276\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.160\nthat allows us to differentiate\nmultiple drives within the system.\n\n277\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.090\nSo that's the first thing it does\nwhen it writes that signature and\n\n278\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.850\nthat is important.\n\n279\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.970\nThe next thing it does is it writes\nsomething called a signature word,\n\n280\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:31.470\nif you will.\n\n281\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.910\nThat's the end of sector marker,\nif you will, that it writes to it.\n\n282\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.760\nAnd then finally, we have to figure\nout how are we going to apply\n\n283\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.530\nthe logical structure to this drive and\nthat's what we see here.\n\n284\n00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.010\nAnd that essentially is choosing whether\nwe're gonna use something known as\n\n285\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.450\nthe Master Boot Record or we're gonna use\nsomething known as a GUID Partition Table.\n\n286\n00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.710\nNow Dan, for the purposes of this show,\nI don't wanna get\n\n287\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.750\ntoo much into a Master Boot Record and\nGPT and the reason I say that, ladies and\n\n288\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.170\ngentlemen, is cuz we're gonna talk about\ninstalling Windows in another episode.\n\n289\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.320\nAnd we have to talk about it because\nthat is a very big decision.\n\n290\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.820\nFor the sake of this show here,\n\n291\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.250\njust understand that\nthere's limitations to MBR.\n\n292\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.980\nMBR has been around for a very long time.\n\n293\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.000\nIt gives us a limitation of four\npartitions or four partitions and\n\n294\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.540\nthen to get past that theological volumes.\n\n295\n00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.650\nProblem with that is,\n\n296\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.770\nI want you to keep in mind is that\nwhen we talk about Master Boot Record,\n\n297\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.020\none of the things that we also limit\nis how large the drive size can be.\n\n298\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.170\nBut Wes, when you say limitations,\nwhat are we talking about here?\n\n299\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.040\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting because\n[LAUGH] we look at 2 TB and\n\n300\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.450\nwe say man that's a big drive.\n\n301\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.390\nThere was a time when hey,\nthat was [INAUDIBLE].\n\n302\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:41.957\n&gt;&gt; That was enormous.\n\n303\n00:15:41.957 --> 00:15:47.203\n&gt;&gt; Fought, 2 TB but there's a 2 TB\nlimitation when it comes to for\n\n304\n00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:49.645\ninstance your MBRs, right.\n\n305\n00:15:49.645 --> 00:15:53.512\nWe have drives that are lot bigger than\nthat today, so if we are gonna use\n\n306\n00:15:53.512 --> 00:15:57.910\na bigger drive size then what we're gonna\nwanna use is the GUID partition table.\n\n307\n00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.881\nSo that's just a little bit about it we'll\ndefinitely get much more involved when it\n\n308\n00:16:02.881 --> 00:16:04.920\ncomes to that in another episode.\n\n309\n00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.513\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead.\n\n310\n00:16:06.513 --> 00:16:11.104\nWe're gonna bring this disk online, all\nright and that's gonna change its status,\n\n311\n00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:13.090\nyou'll see from offline to online.\n\n312\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.130\nAnd we'll go ahead and chose Online.\n\n313\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.216\nAll right but now we've got to\ndo a little bit more than that.\n\n314\n00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:25.445\nWhat we end up having to do is, we have\nto apply a file system to it, right?\n\n315\n00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:27.475\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's do that, right?\n\n316\n00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:31.080\nSo, the first thing, let me go ahead and\nback out of this just a little bit here,\n\n317\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.770\nis what we are going to do is, notice\nthat we are going to take this disk.\n\n318\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.440\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna be able\nto use it so we apply a file system to it.\n\n319\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.400\nAnd then once we apply a file system to\nit it essentially mounts the drive and\n\n320\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.250\nit assigns it a drive letter.\n\n321\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.940\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nright click on it and\n\n322\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.330\nI'm gonna chose New Simple Volume,\nchose Next.\n\n323\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.372\nAnd we'll show this a little bit more\nin other episodes too because we\n\n324\n00:16:54.372 --> 00:16:57.322\nreally gotta talk about installing\nthe operating system as well.\n\n325\n00:16:57.322 --> 00:17:00.900\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna walk through this Wizard here.\n\n326\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.830\nAnd you'll see that it's gonna\ngive it a mounting point,\n\n327\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.620\nit's gonna give it a drive letter and\nI'll just take the next sequential\n\n328\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.740\ndrive letter, it's the letter E here,\nand we'll just go ahead and choose Next.\n\n329\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.962\nWe'll apply the basic file system here,\nNTFS.\n\n330\n00:17:12.962 --> 00:17:18.730\nAgain guys I won't leave you hanging on\nthis one, and we'll just call this data\n\n331\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:23.070\nfor the purposes of showing you disk\nmanagement, we'll choose Fnish.\n\n332\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.720\nAll right so that initializes the drive.\n\n333\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:31.170\nThe drive status goes from offline to\nonline right after we've added that drive.\n\n334\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.960\nAnd now we can see that\nwe've got a mounting point.\n\n335\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.730\nWe've got a drive letter and\nwe should see File Explorer telling us,\n\n336\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.280\nhey you wanna go ahead and\nopen the folder and view the files or\n\n337\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.920\nessentially do you wanna\nstart working with the drive?\n\n338\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.551\nHowever, maybe I decide that you know\nwhat I don't like the letter E today,\n\n339\n00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:48.553\nI'm not feeling like I like the letter E.\n\n340\n00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:50.756\nMaybe I wanna actually\nchange the drive letter.\n\n341\n00:17:50.756 --> 00:17:55.465\nWell you can always do that, you can right\nclick on this drive and you can choose,\n\n342\n00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:58.560\nChange Driver Letter or Path, right?\n\n343\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.200\nSo if you look here,\nhere's the letter E, right?\n\n344\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.742\nWe can actually change that letter E and\n\n345\n00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:05.090\nI don't know,\nmaybe I'm gonna go to the letter F, right?\n\n346\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.220\nAnd then I choose OK and\nit's letting me know, be careful on this.\n\n347\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.420\nIf you've already got some programs that\nyou've pointed to drive letter E and\n\n348\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.365\nyou've changed it to letter F,\nyou need to go back in and\n\n349\n00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:19.930\nchange those applications because they're\nnot going to know what's going on here.\n\n350\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.690\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Yes.\n\n351\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.950\nAnd sure enough well guess what we have\nchanged that letter from the letter\n\n352\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.540\nE to the letter F.\n\n353\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.070\nAll right so a lot of great things\nthat we can do here with this.\n\n354\n00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.560\nDo keep that in mind.\n\n355\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.170\nNow there might be a time in which maybe\nwe wanna split a partition all, right?\n\n356\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.920\nAnd we can do that as well.\n\n357\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.260\nso maybe I decide that I\nwanna have two different\n\n358\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.100\nlogical divisions within this hard drive.\n\n359\n00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:51.700\nOne I want to store data on,\nmaybe one I wanna store music on.\n\n360\n00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.180\nAnd I want to have data in one and\nmusic in the other, right?\n\n361\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.240\nWell, one great thing about disk\nmanagement is it does give you the ability\n\n362\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.250\nto modify, manage these hard drives\nreally the way you want, right?\n\n363\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.840\nSo one of the things that we can\ndo here if we want is we can\n\n364\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.660\nright click on any of the drives here.\n\n365\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.130\nAnd let me also make mention of this too.\n\n366\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.013\nThat pay attention to which disk you\nhave selected, that is important,\n\n367\n00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:21.734\nright here is where you select\nthe different disks within the system,\n\n368\n00:19:21.734 --> 00:19:25.274\nbut then the partitions have\nto be selected as well.\n\n369\n00:19:25.274 --> 00:19:26.640\nYou gotta be careful with this one.\n\n370\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.070\nSo if I select the system partician, I'm\nstill in disk 0, but notice how I've got\n\n371\n00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.700\nthese diagonal lines versus selecting\nthis partician or volume if you will.\n\n372\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.000\nAnd it now lets me know that\nI've selected that volume.\n\n373\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.620\nSo that's also important too, all right?\n\n374\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:46.950\nSo, let's go ahead and let's scroll down\nhere and we'll select our data partition.\n\n375\n00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.440\nAnd we're gonna actually split this.\n\n376\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.341\nNow how do we split the partition?\n\n377\n00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:54.680\nWell we split the partition in this\ncase by shrinking the partition, or\n\n378\n00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.240\nlike Microsoft likes to apply\nthe term volume to their partition.\n\n379\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.100\nWe'll go ahead and shrink it and\nthen what it does is it says okay,\n\n380\n00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.500\nwell this is about how much we can\nshrink this partition if you want or\n\n381\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.610\nthis volume if you want.\n\n382\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.550\nI'm gonna just go ahead and\nmake it easier.\n\n383\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.360\nAnd I'll say, well let's go ahead and\nshrink it by about 10 gigs.\n\n384\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.740\nSo we'll do this, let's see,\n20, or 10240, and\n\n385\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.045\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe will shrink the partition, right.\n\n386\n00:20:21.045 --> 00:20:23.736\nSo now it's split, right?\n\n387\n00:20:23.736 --> 00:20:27.824\nBut the other partition we can't use yet,\nthe other volume we can't use.\n\n388\n00:20:27.824 --> 00:20:28.362\nWhy?\n\n389\n00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:30.684\nWe don't have a file system applied to it.\n\n390\n00:20:30.684 --> 00:20:32.043\nWe don't have a mounting point to it.\n\n391\n00:20:32.043 --> 00:20:35.201\nSo, we have to go back, and\nlike we did the first time,\n\n392\n00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:37.417\nwe have to create a new simple volume.\n\n393\n00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:41.193\nI'll right click on it, I'll choose next,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n394\n00:20:41.193 --> 00:20:45.227\nuse the maximum volume size, and\nhere's that pesky letter E coming back.\n\n395\n00:20:45.227 --> 00:20:47.047\nWe'll go ahead, I changed my mind.\n\n396\n00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:49.130\nI don't mind the letter e so much.\n\n397\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.620\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n398\n00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.187\nWe'll call the,\nwe'll just call this split.\n\n399\n00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:56.376\nAll right, or I'll call it something\nclose to that, because, well,\n\n400\n00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:57.876\nI can't really spell that well.\n\n401\n00:20:57.876 --> 00:20:58.902\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But don't tell anybody.\n\n402\n00:20:58.902 --> 00:21:00.721\nAll right, so we'll call this Split.\n\n403\n00:21:00.721 --> 00:21:04.190\nAnd you just kinda differentiate, so\nyou guys can see what's going on here.\n\n404\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:10.107\nAll right, so now I have split the volume,\nsplit the partition, if you will.\n\n405\n00:21:10.107 --> 00:21:13.687\nWe shrank the volume, or\nshrank the partition.\n\n406\n00:21:13.687 --> 00:21:15.818\nWell, what if I decide,\nwell, you know what?\n\n407\n00:21:15.818 --> 00:21:18.621\nI'm don't know,\nI can't make up my mind today.\n\n408\n00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:21.591\nI think I wanna go ahead and\nI wanna put all my data, all my music,\n\n409\n00:21:21.591 --> 00:21:22.861\nall in the same partition.\n\n410\n00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:24.900\nThe same volume.\n\n411\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.750\nWell, what do you have to do?\n\n412\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.850\nThen, what you have to do is what\nis known as an extended part.\n\n413\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.840\nYou gotta extend,\nI gotta be careful on how I say that.\n\n414\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.110\nExtend the partition or\nin this case extend the volume,\n\n415\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.950\nand we can also do that to.\n\n416\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.150\nSo, extend the volume.\n\n417\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.430\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna right click, and\n\n418\n00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.070\nwe're gonna choose,\nlet's see here, extend volume.\n\n419\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:50.410\nAnd you know what I've got two volumes and\nthey're already formatted.\n\n420\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.220\nSo what I gotta do here to extend the\nvolume, I have to delete one first, right?\n\n421\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.230\nCuz it's looking at this disk and\nit's saying, there's nothing to extend to.\n\n422\n00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.965\nYou don't have any free space,\neven though I haven't used this partition,\n\n423\n00:22:00.965 --> 00:22:01.610\nit's seeing it as formatted.\n\n424\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.190\nIt's seeing it as used.\n\n425\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.920\nSo let me go ahead and delete that first\nand now that I have unallocated space,\n\n426\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.940\nI bet you if I right click that\nExtend Volume kinda shows up and\n\n427\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.710\nthat's what was going on there.\n\n428\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:18.310\nSo now what we can do is we can run to the\nwizard to extend the partition if we want.\n\n429\n00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:23.010\nAnd it lets us know okay what's available,\ndisc two was selected,\n\n430\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.488\nwe can chose Next, we can chose Finish and\nwe can extend it out.\n\n431\n00:22:26.488 --> 00:22:28.378\nAll right,\n\n432\n00:22:28.378 --> 00:22:33.460\nnow that's one of the things that you can\ndo here inside of your operating system.\n\n433\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.660\nNow the other thing that you also have\nthe ability to do if you have the right\n\n434\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.660\nhard drives and\nthey are configured in a certain way,\n\n435\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.070\nyou can also add things\nlike software based arrays.\n\n436\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.910\nNow be careful, we talked about array in\nanother episode, but remember raid array,\n\n437\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.530\na hardware based raid array is always\nbetter cuz hardware assisted raid means\n\n438\n00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.950\nyou got dedicated hardware that it's\nwhole sole purpose is to give you\n\n439\n00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:03.700\na really good performance versus software\nbased arrays, or raids if you will.\n\n440\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.890\nYou're robbing the CPU of\nvaluable computational cycles\n\n441\n00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.880\nthat it could be doing to other stuffs so\nyou don't quite get the performance.\n\n442\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.090\nAll right, but you do have to kind\nof change these disks a little bit,\n\n443\n00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.620\nif you will, in order to do that.\n\n444\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.200\nSo let me go ahead.\n\n445\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:26.080\nAnd one of the things that we're going to\ndo, I'm going to bring this disk online.\n\n446\n00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.920\nAll right?\n\n447\n00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.480\nAnd what I'm going to do is,\n\n448\n00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.630\nI'm going to go ahead and\ndelete the volume here real quick.\n\n449\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.390\nLet me go ahead and delete all\nthe volumes and show you what you can do.\n\n450\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.340\nLet me go ahead and\ndelete the volume that we just created.\n\n451\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.900\nIn the partition we've just created.\n\n452\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.520\nHere And\nwe're gonna right click on this disk.\n\n453\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.500\nAnd this is another one of those\ndifferences between MBR and GPT.\n\n454\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.080\nI can't use a basic disk, is what I was\ntrying to say, and not coming out right.\n\n455\n00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.000\nI can't use what's known as a basic disk,\n\n456\n00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.740\ncuz a basic disk falls under\nthat MBR type setting.\n\n457\n00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.020\nSo what I have to do is convert\nthis to a dynamic disk.\n\n458\n00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.260\nIf I want to be able to use it to add a, a\nsoftware-based array or add an array here.\n\n459\n00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:10.172\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say Disk 1 and\nDisk 2, following in disk management here,\n\n460\n00:24:10.172 --> 00:24:12.764\nDisk 1 and Disk 2,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n461\n00:24:12.764 --> 00:24:16.800\nwe're going to convert those\nto dynamic disks, all right?\n\n462\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.400\nBoy, wasn't that absolutely amazing.\n\n463\n00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.181\nIt doesn't look like it did anything,\nright?\n\n464\n00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:22.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Really blew my mind there, Wes.\n\n465\n00:24:22.616 --> 00:24:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know, woah, watch out,\nthat's some heavy technology there.\n\n466\n00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.540\nAll it did is it changed the letter,\nright, it changed the name here.\n\n467\n00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:35.470\nBut what it allows me to do is start to\nadd additional type arrays, all right?\n\n468\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.110\nIn this case they're calling\nthem Spanned or Stripped Volume.\n\n469\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.450\nIt's the same thing as like for\ninstance adding a RAID array, right?\n\n470\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.266\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll create a Striped array if you will.\n\n471\n00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:49.889\nWe'll choose next, and we're gonna add\nthe disks that are going into the array,\n\n472\n00:24:49.889 --> 00:24:53.111\nright, we're adding an array here so\nI just choose add.\n\n473\n00:24:53.111 --> 00:24:57.908\nAnd then I can tell that I've got\nboth of these disks selected to\n\n474\n00:24:57.908 --> 00:25:03.420\nadd to the array itself here if I want,\nand we'll choose next.\n\n475\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.910\nThere's that letter E coming out.\n\n476\n00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.950\nI'm just gonna come in,\ncome over to the dark side, and\n\n477\n00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.670\nwe'll use the letter E here.\n\n478\n00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.470\nAnd I'll choose next.\n\n479\n00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:16.200\nAnd we'll call this adding array, and\n\n480\n00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.935\nwe'll go ahead and\ndo a quick format on it, finish.\n\n481\n00:25:18.935 --> 00:25:22.400\nAnd now what I'm gonna end up seeing\n\n482\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.660\nis that notice the colors\nhave changed a little bit?\n\n483\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:30.690\nNow notice I see two discs, and I see\ntwo discs associated with the letter E.\n\n484\n00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.440\nLet's see what Explorer looks like.\n\n485\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.790\nWhen I look at Explorer,\nit only sees a single one, right?\n\n486\n00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.980\nSo that's no different than adding\narrayed array in adding that in\n\n487\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.900\nphysical hardware versus software.\n\n488\n00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.200\nHowever, the performance here it does give\nyou the capabilities but it doesn't give\n\n489\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.210\nyou the performance capabilities\nof any hardware assisted array.\n\n490\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.420\nNow there's a couple other things that\nI wanna kinda mention here before we\n\n491\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.640\nwrap this one up here.\n\n492\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.970\nI wanna mention something known\nas storage spaces all right?\n\n493\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.370\nStorage spaces was something that was\nbrought into our operating system in\n\n494\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.240\nWindows 8 and 8.1.\n\n495\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.230\nAnd what this allows me to do\nunlike disk management where I\n\n496\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.230\nhave to utilize just the internal\ndisks that are in the system, imagine\n\n497\n00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:16.760\nthe ability to use all different kinds of\ndisks including external USB disks as well\n\n498\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.780\nthe internal disks that you have within\nyour system, and making one very,\n\n499\n00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.320\nvery large pool if you will could\ncollection of storage locations right?\n\n500\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.480\nThat's something know as a storage space.\n\n501\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.880\nAnd if we go to Control Panel here,\nlet me go ahead and login in real quick.\n\n502\n00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.800\nIf we go to Control Panel here,\nI'll right click on our Windows tile.\n\n503\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.370\nWe'll choose Control Panel.\n\n504\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.740\nAnd we're gonna go to System and Security.\n\n505\n00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.770\nYou should see that we have\nsomething known as Storage Spaces.\n\n506\n00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:50.800\nStorage Spaces allows me the ability to\ncreate what are known as Storage pools.\n\n507\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.710\nAll right, now let me go ahead and,\nit looks like I already got one,\n\n508\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.680\nlet me go ahead and\ndelete this pool here really quick.\n\n509\n00:26:57.026 --> 00:27:00.330\nAnd it's going to erase everything\nthat's why it was warning me there, but\n\n510\n00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:05.150\nwhat I can do is I can take multiple hard\ndrives including external drives and\n\n511\n00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:09.230\nI can collect them together and\nmake one storage solution out of them.\n\n512\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.620\nAnd you could see I've got\nthree different disk here.\n\n513\n00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.920\nI could add them all to a pool\nthat makes them one big\n\n514\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.650\ncollection location and\nthen I could make logical divisions.\n\n515\n00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.970\nI could separate those out as I want,\nright?\n\n516\n00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.660\nAnd I could do this for\nthe sake of redundancy.\n\n517\n00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.160\nI could do this for\n\n518\n00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.340\nthe sake of just having multiple,\na bigger storage location.\n\n519\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.060\nIn this case, I'm gonna do what's known\nas a Two-way mirror storage space.\n\n520\n00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.720\nAnd that's one that's kind of like your\nmirror that you would have at the hardware\n\n521\n00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.411\nrate array or\neven the the rate array that we, or\n\n522\n00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:42.860\nthe software array that you've\nseen that we can create.\n\n523\n00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.040\nWe created a Striped one,\n\n524\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.575\nwe could have created a mirror\narray inside a disk management.\n\n525\n00:27:47.575 --> 00:27:50.775\nBut the big difference here is we\ncan use multiple drive types and\n\n526\n00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:51.715\nthat the great thing here.\n\n527\n00:27:51.715 --> 00:27:55.065\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll create the storage space.\n\n528\n00:27:55.065 --> 00:27:56.685\nThere's that letter E again.\n\n529\n00:27:56.685 --> 00:28:01.940\nAnd you'll notice that when I bring up\nWindows Explorer here, I now have or\n\n530\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.160\nFile Explorer in this case\nbecause it's Windows 8,\n\n531\n00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.790\nI now have another storage location but\n\n532\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.930\nthat storage location could be made\nup of multiple different drive types.\n\n533\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:15.250\nSo all great things that we can have,\nall good things to keep in mind\n\n534\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:20.360\nthat you can use for your storage medium\nwhen it comes to the administration.\n\n535\n00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.060\nNow there are a couple of last little\nthings that I want to just kind\n\n536\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.270\nof shore up here.\n\n537\n00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.110\nSome of these we have\nalready talked about.\n\n538\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.450\nSome of them we haven't all right?\n\n539\n00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.520\nAnd these are some other system utilities.\n\n540\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.270\nFor instance, the registry editor.\n\n541\n00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:38.070\nRegistry editor is something that we can\nuse and in a registry editor, in order to,\n\n542\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.960\nbe careful modifying the registry, because\nit's a collection of configuration data,\n\n543\n00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.010\nthat if modified could cause\nirreversible damage, and\n\n544\n00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.560\ninstantaneous damage to\nthe operating system.\n\n545\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.260\nBut, if we ever needed to modify the\nregistry, or even look at the registry,\n\n546\n00:28:53.260 --> 00:29:00.570\nwe could type reg edit, and that does\nhave to be spelled right, regedit there.\n\n547\n00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that.\n\n548\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, imagine that right, and\nthat would bring up the registry editor.\n\n549\n00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.060\nThese are some of those run line commands\nthat we've already kind of seen before.\n\n550\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.710\nThese are a couple of the additional\nones that we want to call out so\n\n551\n00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:11.610\nthat you're aware of them.\n\n552\n00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:18.870\nAgain, be careful making modifications\nto your registry in any way.\n\n553\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:24.460\nWe've already launched the services\nconsole, remember services.mse.\n\n554\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.890\nNotepad, well guess what, you can also\ngo to your traditional run line, and\n\n555\n00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.770\nyou could type in notepad.exe and\n\n556\n00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.110\nguess what, its gonna launch a Notepad for\nyou, right?\n\n557\n00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.020\nSo that's a great thing to have as well.\n\n558\n00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.850\nSome of the other ones that we have too,\n\n559\n00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:45.700\nif we wanted to make our own Microsoft\nManagement Console we could type in mmc,\n\n560\n00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.590\nand again, that could be .exe, one of the\ngreat things is, it is kind of implied so\n\n561\n00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.880\nyou don't have to do that but\nunderstand that it is an executable.\n\n562\n00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.180\nAnd it allows me to essentially\nto add my own utilities or\n\n563\n00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.540\ntools that I could use snap-ins, right?\n\n564\n00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.550\nI could end up adding the same things that\nwe see, including Computer Management, but\n\n565\n00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.770\nmany of the same utilities that we\nsee inside of Computer Management.\n\n566\n00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.520\nNow we talked in another episode about\nsomething known as remote desktop.\n\n567\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.770\nI'm gonna go ahead and close that down.\n\n568\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.840\nAnd one of the ways through the line\nline command could run remote desktop is\n\n569\n00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:24.930\nto type in ms, what is that, mst,\nyou know I think that's a typo.\n\n570\n00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:25.720\nIt is actually.\n\n571\n00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.550\nMicrosoft thermal services clients so\nit's mstsc.\n\n572\n00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.295\n&gt;&gt; So what's this?\n\n573\n00:30:31.295 --> 00:30:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I didn't know if it was right and\nI could type the .exe.\n\n574\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.840\nSo it's mstsc.\n\n575\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.140\nAnd that launches your remote\ndesktop connection software.\n\n576\n00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.170\nAgain we talked about remote\ndesktop in another episode.\n\n577\n00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:43.990\nWell guess what?\n\n578\n00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.660\nIf I wanted to launch\nExplorer I can do that,\n\n579\n00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.480\nI could type Explorer.\n\n580\n00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.466\nAnd you don't have to type to the .exe\nhere but I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n581\n00:30:55.466 --> 00:30:56.500\ntype it anyways.\n\n582\n00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.950\nExplorer.exe launches up\nWindows Explorer or File Explorer.\n\n583\n00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:05.980\nNow, let's say that you need to gains of\ninformation about your system, right?\n\n584\n00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.420\nSystem information,\na lot of detailed information.\n\n585\n00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:16.340\nWell they have a utility that will allow\nyou to do that, it's called msinfo32.exe.\n\n586\n00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:22.083\nAnd again just typing it in the run line,\nwe've got msinfo32.exe.\n\n587\n00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:26.946\nNotice that we have our system information\nand it gives you all the information\n\n588\n00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:32.029\nabout the system itself, individual\nhardware resources, like the old IRQ's,\n\n589\n00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:37.184\nDMA's, direct memory access, memory\nconflicts, memory conflicts, we don't\n\n590\n00:31:37.184 --> 00:31:42.220\nhave to worry about this, too, with a lot\nof the advanced configuration today.\n\n591\n00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.516\nThese are handled in the background for\nus.\n\n592\n00:31:44.516 --> 00:31:48.460\nAll the components, hardware components,\nfor instance, that we would see inside of\n\n593\n00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.260\nthings like Device Manager,\nas well as the software environment,\n\n594\n00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.080\nincluding things like Environment\nVariables and and System Drivers.\n\n595\n00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.530\nSo msinfo32 is a great thing to have.\n\n596\n00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.885\nIf you are having graphics problems,\nwe've kind of talked a little bit about\n\n597\n00:32:01.885 --> 00:32:04.840\nthe drivers and the issues that some\nof the drivers could cause too.\n\n598\n00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:11.600\nYou can also Troubleshoot the video\nsubsystem through the run line.\n\n599\n00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.600\nAnd that would be with\nsomething known as DxDiag.\n\n600\n00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.510\nAgain DirectX utility.\n\n601\n00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.610\nWe get our term Xbox, right?\n\n602\n00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:23.870\nXbox is based off the same technology\nas the Windows PC's graphic subsystem.\n\n603\n00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.540\nThey just decided not to\ncall it the Direct Xbox.\n\n604\n00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.060\nThey dropped direct.\n\n605\n00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.160\nBut we can do DxDiag.\n\n606\n00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:37.420\nAnd dxdiag.exe would allow me to\nrun the DirectX diagnostic utility.\n\n607\n00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.900\nAnd I'm gonna say no to this.\n\n608\n00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.930\nIt'll probably run it anyways.\n\n609\n00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.970\nAnd it runs it anyways even though\n[LAUGH] eve though you say no.\n\n610\n00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.096\nBut this is your DirectX\ndiagnostic tool and\n\n611\n00:32:46.096 --> 00:32:50.460\nit allows you to troubleshoot things\nrelated to the video subsystem.\n\n612\n00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.930\nWe've also talked about\nthe disk defragmenter, right?\n\n613\n00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.160\nWe also have Defrag that we could run.\n\n614\n00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.710\nI believe in Windows 8.8 and\n8.1 they changed it to file optimizer.\n\n615\n00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.820\nFor the longest time,\nit's been known as disk defragmenter.\n\n616\n00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:09.984\nBut if I run a defrag.exe and\nI go ahead and run this.\n\n617\n00:33:09.984 --> 00:33:11.730\nYou know it did run it\nin the command prompt.\n\n618\n00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.450\nThat's interesting.\n\n619\n00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.962\nI was wondering if it was\ngonna run file optimizer, but\n\n620\n00:33:14.962 --> 00:33:17.760\nthis is actually one we can see\ninside of the command prompt.\n\n621\n00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.663\nSo let me go ahead and\nadjust our font real quick here and\n\n622\n00:33:22.663 --> 00:33:25.760\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n623\n00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.510\nAnd again, this is more of\na command line utility there.\n\n624\n00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.300\nYou could also launch any one of\nthese from the command line too.\n\n625\n00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:38.003\nAnd again, we would do something like for\ninstance running defrag.exe.\n\n626\n00:33:38.003 --> 00:33:43.237\nSo defrag.exe and you can see that\nthere are ways that you could run\n\n627\n00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:49.050\nessentially your defragmenting\nsoftware inside of the command prompt.\n\n628\n00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.590\nAll right, so those are a few of\nthe system utilities you have.\n\n629\n00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.650\nI think one of the last ones.\n\n630\n00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:58.632\nWe've already talked about system restore\nin another episode, so go back and\n\n631\n00:33:58.632 --> 00:34:00.270\ncheck the features out of that.\n\n632\n00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:04.187\nBut I also wanna mention Windows update\nlast but certainly not least, and\n\n633\n00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:07.533\nif we could take a look at my screen,\nthat is inside of system and\n\n634\n00:34:07.533 --> 00:34:09.322\nsecurity in your control panel.\n\n635\n00:34:09.322 --> 00:34:13.340\nIf we could take a look at\nthe machine that would be great.\n\n636\n00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.669\nWe will see Windows updates and\nif we go to Windows update here,\n\n637\n00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:22.180\nyou will notice that this is where\nwe could check for our updates.\n\n638\n00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.845\nWe could change settings.\n\n639\n00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:26.380\nIt says hey do you want\nto install your updates?\n\n640\n00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.890\nDo you wanna download updates,\nnever check for\n\n641\n00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:32.590\nupdates including giving updates for\nother products?\n\n642\n00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.578\nAs well as, if I back out of this,\n\n643\n00:34:34.578 --> 00:34:37.347\nreviewing things like\nyour update history and\n\n644\n00:34:37.347 --> 00:34:42.250\nyou can find out all of the updates that\nare currently being applied to the system.\n\n645\n00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.402\nYou can also view individual details\nif you kind of wanna know a little bit\n\n646\n00:34:45.402 --> 00:34:46.560\nmore information.\n\n647\n00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.280\nSo a lot of great utilities\nthat we have here.\n\n648\n00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.233\nAgain, I know it's been one of those ones\nthat we really run a gamut when it comes\n\n649\n00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:57.010\nto all the different types, but they\nare some things that you need to know and\n\n650\n00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:01.240\nyou'll have to be prepared to make that\nsure you pass that 220-902 A+ exam.\n\n651\n00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n652\n00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.010\nWell there were a lot of ups and\ndowns, right?\n\n653\n00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.610\nA lot of twists and turns, but\n\n654\n00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.910\nI think we're all ready to get off of this\nroller coaster and let it just seep in.\n\n655\n00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:14.259\nLet us stew in it for a little bit\nuntil we assimilate all this knowledge\n\n656\n00:35:14.259 --> 00:35:17.723\ninto our being so\nthat we can go out as A+ technicians and\n\n657\n00:35:17.723 --> 00:35:22.100\neither pass the A+ exam or work in\nthe field and apply this knowledge.\n\n658\n00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.250\nVery good stuff though.\n\n659\n00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:26.380\nDefinitely a lot of great tools inside\nof the Windows operating system.\n\n660\n00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.390\nSo go forth, young budding techs,\nand make it happen out there.\n\n661\n00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.320\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n662\n00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.120\nWe do appreciate you watching though.\n\n663\n00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.340\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n664\n00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.170\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n665\n00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.311\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n666\n00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:46.395\n[MUSIC]\n\n667\n00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:48.285\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.272\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:12.076\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:13.848\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone,\n\n6\n00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:17.160\nand welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.305\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well, guess what, we\n\n8\n00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:25.990\nare moving on with more in our A+ series,\nthe 220-902 software side of things.\n\n9\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.080\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nyet again,\n\n10\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.120\nto help us out with that,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.700\nWes, welcome back, man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nfeeling good, glad to be here again.\n\n13\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.476\nThat's right, we are moving along\nin our Windows operating system.\n\n14\n00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.680\nDan's already called it out, we're gonna\nbe looking at control panel utilities.\n\n15\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.635\nAnd we've kinda showed you\nhow to get to control panel.\n\n16\n00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:48.497\nRemember that control panel very\nbasically, we talk about that being,\n\n17\n00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:52.043\nwhen it comes to any kind of\nadministrative functionality that you\n\n18\n00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:56.243\nneed to perform, maintenance,\npreventative maintenance, diagnostics.\n\n19\n00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:59.750\nControl panel is where you\nare going to go, all right?\n\n20\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.740\nIn the previous episode,\n\n21\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.070\nwe told you how you can modify\nsome of the control panel layout.\n\n22\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.950\nLet's go ahead, and\nwe're gonna dive right in, and\n\n23\n00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.130\nwe're gonna basically dive into\nthe control panel interface.\n\n24\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.040\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n25\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.450\nI've got a Windows 7 machine right here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.440\nRemember that we're just gonna push Start,\nand from the Start menu,\n\n27\n00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.170\nwe're gonna choose control panel.\n\n28\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.665\nNow, just like some of the other\noperating systems that we have,\n\n29\n00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.640\nI've got a Vista machine.\n\n30\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.188\nKeep in mind that this is also Start and\ncontrol panel, right?\n\n31\n00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.521\nCouple of things that are a little bit\ndifferent that we wanna just real quick,\n\n32\n00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.236\nwe wanna recap.\n\n33\n00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:33.993\nRemember that in other episodes,\n\n34\n00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.573\nwe've talked about control panel\nhome versus classic view, right?\n\n35\n00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:42.950\nControl panel home is the categorization\nof all of the utilities, right?\n\n36\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.200\nWhere the classic view kinda\nlays out everything here, and\n\n37\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.830\nyou can kinda find all of\nyour different utilities.\n\n38\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.350\nThat's what it was called in Vista.\n\n39\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.590\nHowever, when we move over to Windows 7\nand then beyond, really, they changed it.\n\n40\n00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.540\nThey called it view by category.\n\n41\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.360\nSo if you hear me call it category view,\nand you're studying on a Vista machine,\n\n42\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.260\nor you're in Vista at the time.\n\n43\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.510\nJust kind of study and understand that\nthis is more semantics than anything else.\n\n44\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.780\nBut it is semantics that\ncould get you on the exam.\n\n45\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.510\nBecause they wanna know, as a tech,\n\n46\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.090\nhave you even opened a control panel\nin the different operating systems?\n\n47\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.070\nNow, if we switch on over to Windows 8,\nif we just right+click, actually,\n\n48\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.122\nif I log in, apparently.\n\n49\n00:02:22.122 --> 00:02:23.431\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:24.570\nlog in to this machine.\n\n51\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.300\nA couple of different ways\nthat you can do this,\n\n52\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.050\nyou can do this from\nthe modern UI if you want to.\n\n53\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.880\nAnd you can just type control, and\nyou'll see control panel right here.\n\n54\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.150\nThe other way too is that\nyou could go to the desktop,\n\n55\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.015\nyou could right click on the Windows tile.\n\n56\n00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:41.840\nAnd then you can choose Control Panel\nright here from the administrative\n\n57\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.599\nquick links.\n\n58\n00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.790\nI really like this, and they've kept\nit in Windows 10, and when they update\n\n59\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.681\nthe A plus exam objectives,\nwe'll probably put Windows 10 in there.\n\n60\n00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:52.480\nBut at the time of this recording,\n\n61\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.965\nunderstand Windows 10 is not going\nto be expected for your exam.\n\n62\n00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:57.700\nAnd so that's really why\nwe're not covering it here.\n\n63\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.120\nBut notice that it really looks the same.\n\n64\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.105\nNotice the whole View by here\nhasn't really changed, right?\n\n65\n00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:09.040\nWe have the large and small icons, and\nthis would have been what's akin to known\n\n66\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.986\nas the classic view that we\nlook at way back here in Vista.\n\n67\n00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:17.410\nSo I do wanna make mention that if\nyou are in a help desk position,\n\n68\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.230\nkeep in mind that there are a lot\nof people that don't ever,\n\n69\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.640\njust your average end user, and\nthat's not talking down to anybody.\n\n70\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.890\nI don't mean this\nNick Barnes style from SNL.\n\n71\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.870\nStand away from the computer,\nyou don't even know what you're doing.\n\n72\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.860\nI certainly don't mean that.\n\n73\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.190\nDon't mean to talk down to anybody, and\n\n74\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.520\nwe don't mean to talk down to anybody\nout there that might be watching.\n\n75\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.810\nJust understand that the average end user,\na lot of times,\n\n76\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.030\nthey don't even go here, right?\n\n77\n00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.580\nSo if you are in a help desk\nposition situation, and Dan,\n\n78\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.690\nyou've mentioned this quite a few times\nthrough this series, that you have to\n\n79\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.560\nunderstand what it is that the end\nuser that doesn't change default sees.\n\n80\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.430\nBecause when you're going through and\nyou're saying, hey,\n\n81\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.430\nI need you to click on this,\nI need you to click on this, well,\n\n82\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.600\nthey're gonna see, probably,\nthis default setting, right?\n\n83\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.800\nThey're gonna see things like System and\nSecurity and Internet, right?\n\n84\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.170\nAnd if you're used to, like a lot of\nus are, you're used to this view,\n\n85\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.310\nwhich I find a lot more convenient,\na lot more stream lined, right?\n\n86\n00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.730\nWell, it makes it look\na little bit different, right?\n\n87\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.620\nSo, if I go to Start, and\nthen I go to Control Panel, well,\n\n88\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.690\nI see administrative view in the center\ncolumn all the way here at the top.\n\n89\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.610\nBut if you're in help desk and you're\ntrying to help somebody through their\n\n90\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.420\ncomputer and they've never\nchanged that default setting and\n\n91\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.440\nthey need to get to control panel\nutilities, they're gonna push Start.\n\n92\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.810\nThey're gonna go to control panel.\n\n93\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.320\nAnd if you say center column, I want\nyou to look for administrative tools.\n\n94\n00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.530\nWell, it isn't here anywhere, right?\n\n95\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.430\nSo again, just as a little recap,\nsome of the things that we've stressed\n\n96\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.210\nthroughout this series that\nI would know defaults, but\n\n97\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.990\nI'd also be familiar with\nthe non-category view as well.\n\n98\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.420\nAgain, more of the administrative type\nview that's called large and small icons.\n\n99\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.530\nNow, that being said,\n\n100\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.720\nlet's talk about some of\nthe utilities that we can see here.\n\n101\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.790\nAnd it doesn't matter if we're\ntalking about category view or\n\n102\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.680\nwe're talking about, again,\nthe large icons, small icons.\n\n103\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.120\nI'm gonna go ahead, for\nthe purposes of training,\n\n104\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.940\nwe're gonna keep it here and\nwhat your average end user might see\n\n105\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.310\nif you were helping them in\na help desk situation, right?\n\n106\n00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.690\nOne of the first things they call out\nis something known as Internet options.\n\n107\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.270\nNow, this is a control panel utility, but\n\n108\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.860\nthere are multiple ways to\nget to Internet options.\n\n109\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.720\nAnd I'd like to tackle them all, not just\ndo the control panel interface, yes.\n\n110\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.350\nThe exam objectives, they call out\nthe control panel interface to get here.\n\n111\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.290\nBut we've also stressed throughout this\nseries too that it's not just about\n\n112\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.142\nwhat's on the exam.\n\n113\n00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:36.150\nWe've given you some practical\napplications of a lot of different things\n\n114\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.960\nthroughout this series.\n\n115\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.780\nSo we're gonna show you multiple ways.\n\n116\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.580\nAll right, so,\nlet's talk about the exam first.\n\n117\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.190\nIf I wanna get to the Internet options,\nright,\n\n118\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.900\nI'm gonna go to control panel, right?\n\n119\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.770\nStart &gt; Control Panel,\nI'm gonna go to Network and Internet, and\n\n120\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.260\nthen right here,\nwe have Internet Options, right?\n\n121\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.189\nThis is what we wanna look at for\na little bit, and\n\n122\n00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.760\nwe're gonna talk about Internet Options\na little bit more here coming up.\n\n123\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.640\nBut I also want you to know that that\nisn't the only way that you can get there.\n\n124\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.500\nRemember, in past episode, we talked\nabout some of the run line commands?\n\n125\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.780\nThis also has a run line command as well.\n\n126\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.360\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna bump over here to Windows 8,\n\n127\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.980\nto show you ladies and gentlemen out there\nthat it really isn't any different, right?\n\n128\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.314\nA little bit different in the fact that\nwe're gonna right-click on the Windows tab\n\n129\n00:06:19.314 --> 00:06:22.233\nversus the Start menu, right,\nthe Start button that's in Windows 7.\n\n130\n00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:24.448\nBut we're still gonna\ngo to Network Internet.\n\n131\n00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:27.230\nAnd we're also gonna go to\nInternet Options, right?\n\n132\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.250\nAnd again, it pretty much looks the same.\n\n133\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.020\nIt's got a lot of the same features,\njust different code of playing, right?\n\n134\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.200\nSo I'll go ahead and I'm gonna close\nthat down, and then we'll come back and\n\n135\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.420\nwe'll talk about those tabs.\n\n136\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.120\nNow, like I said, the other thing that you\ncan do is you can do a run line command.\n\n137\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.463\nAnd this one sometimes isn't so\ncommon that people would know\n\n138\n00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:47.202\nsomething like computer management,\nwhere it's compmgmt.msc.\n\n139\n00:06:47.202 --> 00:06:52.943\nThis is actually inet,\nshort for Internet, CPL.CPL.\n\n140\n00:06:52.943 --> 00:06:55.080\nAnd we can run this.\n\n141\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.613\nAnd notice that this is\nInternet properties, right?\n\n142\n00:06:57.613 --> 00:07:01.990\nAnd we call them Internet options,\nas well inside of the control panel.\n\n143\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.821\nNow that isn't the only place\nthat you can go, all right?\n\n144\n00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.737\nI'm gonna kinda switch in and out between\nWindows 7 and Windows 8.1 here, so\n\n145\n00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:12.260\nyou guys can see kinda what's going\non between both operating systems.\n\n146\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.510\nNow the other place that we can go is\ninto your Internet Explorer, right?\n\n147\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.490\nSo notice that I'm in Internet Explorer.\n\n148\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.250\nAnd no, that's okay, Google,\nI don't want Chrome right now.\n\n149\n00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.070\nBut we'll save that for another episode.\n\n150\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.920\nAnd I'm gonna go to the gear icon all\n\n151\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.990\nthe way up here in the upper\nright hand corner.\n\n152\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.170\nNotice that it says tools, and\n\n153\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.800\nif I scroll down, I can scroll\ndown to Internet options, right?\n\n154\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.460\nAnd then Internet Options\nbrings me exactly that, right?\n\n155\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.759\nIt brings me back to the Internet Options\nthat I need to get to.\n\n156\n00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.760\nAll right, now why am I showing you\na couple of different ways to get here?\n\n157\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.356\nWell, you need to know that, right?\n\n158\n00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:49.870\nYou might be supporting an end user.\n\n159\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.060\nAnd that's why I said it's not just about,\nand well, we both said this.\n\n160\n00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.579\nIt's not just about what's on the exam.\n\n161\n00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:56.923\nIt's also practical application of what\nyou're gonna be seeing inside of the real\n\n162\n00:07:56.923 --> 00:07:57.600\nworld, right?\n\n163\n00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.848\nSomebody might already have Have\nInternet Explorer open on their desktop.\n\n164\n00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:06.910\nAnd you need to show them how to\nget to the Internet options, right?\n\n165\n00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.530\nNow here's another thing, why did I take\nthe time to show you one crazy way to open\n\n166\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.170\nthis, right through the Modern UI, right?\n\n167\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.570\nYou can also do this too,\nInetcpl.cpl, all right?\n\n168\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.100\nAnd notice,\nit's a little Control panel right?\n\n169\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.620\ncpl control panel there.\n\n170\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.690\nAnd I can also run Internet options,\nit's called Internet properties from here.\n\n171\n00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.180\nBut Internet options from here as well.\n\n172\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.110\nAll right now,\nwhy do we take the time to show you that?\n\n173\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:41.330\nI have had to do this myself where\nInternet Explorer, it has a virus.\n\n174\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.250\nAnd what happens is when you\nopen up Internet Explorer,\n\n175\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.970\nit automatically redirects you, right?\n\n176\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.465\nYou get these redirectors and the only\nthing that it's actually going to run\n\n177\n00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.685\nis to a third-party website because\nyou got some kind of ransomware or\n\n178\n00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.886\nsome kind of malware going\non in your computer.\n\n179\n00:08:55.886 --> 00:09:00.922\nWell, if that's the case then you have\nto know a quick way, a quick way to get\n\n180\n00:09:00.922 --> 00:09:06.467\nto your Internet options, if you're ever\ngonna do some kind of trouble shooting.\n\n181\n00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:09.017\nThis is one of the fastest ways\nthat you can do it, right?\n\n182\n00:09:09.017 --> 00:09:11.970\nI didn't open Internet explorer at all.\n\n183\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.389\nAt all.\nRight from the modern UI,\n\n184\n00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:20.595\nall I do is type inetcpl.cpl hit enter and\nlook how fast it's there, all right?\n\n185\n00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:23.210\nSo that's one of the reasons\nI wanted to show you that.\n\n186\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.620\nIt's a good practical way\nto get to Internet options\n\n187\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.800\nif you ever have some kind of\nreset that you need to do.\n\n188\n00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.560\nAnd I'll show you exactly where to do a\nreset, it might save you a lot of time and\n\n189\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.280\ntroubleshooting if somebody calls you and\nsays hey,\n\n190\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.000\nI've got a virus on this machine,\nall right?\n\n191\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.340\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's just talk about,\n\n192\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.930\nwell, we'll go in the order\nof the notes in there.\n\n193\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.980\nI will tell you, Dan, that it's a little\nbackwards than what these tabs are, right?\n\n194\n00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.990\nSo in our order, right?\n\n195\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.101\nThey talk about connections.\n\n196\n00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:50.300\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\nWell, we'll go ahead and\n\n197\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.840\nwe'll follow along if you guys and\n\n198\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.900\ngals out there are looking at\nthe actual objectives here.\n\n199\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.920\nSo that you know where the heck\n[LAUGH] we are in the objectives.\n\n200\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.310\nWe'll talk about connections first right?\n\n201\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.390\nConnections is a way that you\ncan set up exactly that, right?\n\n202\n00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.050\nI could set up connections.\n\n203\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.880\nNow, this can also be done for\ndifferent locations, so\n\n204\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.030\nwe're not gonna set up\nany connections here.\n\n205\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.000\nBecause we will look at\nanother way to do this.\n\n206\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.730\nAnd in fact let me show you real quick.\n\n207\n00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.180\nMy head's kinda covering it up though.\n\n208\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.256\nBut if I right click on the little\nmonitor icon here and I choose open.\n\n209\n00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:24.870\nI open up Network and Sharing Center.\n\n210\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.750\nNotice this task link here says set up\na new connection or network, right?\n\n211\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.780\nAnd I can also set up\na connection from here.\n\n212\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.740\nWe're going to save that for\n\n213\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.440\nanother time just wanted to\nshow that you could do that.\n\n214\n00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.200\nAll right?\n\n215\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.620\nYou can also add a VPN here.\n\n216\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.880\nNow, we're also going to set\nup VPN's in a later episode.\n\n217\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.250\nBut because it's here we want to\nshow you that yes you could do it.\n\n218\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.270\nRight here from Internet options,\nall right?\n\n219\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.287\nSo, check out our networking\nsection in 22902,\n\n220\n00:10:50.287 --> 00:10:53.510\nbecause we'll definitely\ntackle that a little bit more.\n\n221\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.630\nDan and I are gonna show you\nhow to connect to a VPN server.\n\n222\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.520\nWe'll show you how to set\nthat up in another episode.\n\n223\n00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.640\n&gt;&gt; We use witchcraft.\n\n224\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.530\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n225\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.035\nPut a little voodoo on it, right?\n\n226\n00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:02.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n227\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.030\na little mojo in the back pocket,\nand you will be good.\n\n228\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.580\n&gt;&gt; Super easy.\n\n229\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\nwe can set up connections from there.\n\n230\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.060\nNow, here is a tab, if we look at,\nand again ladies and\n\n231\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.690\ngentlemen, let me just switch back over\nhere so you guys and gals out there know,\n\n232\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.980\nthat this really isn't much different,\nright?\n\n233\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.720\nNotice that we also have the Connections\ntab, setting up a connection.\n\n234\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.519\nWe're also going to,\nnext to go to the Security tab.\n\n235\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.100\nThey look the same, all right?\n\n236\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.110\nAnd again notice that its just\na different coat of paint but\n\n237\n00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.940\nits a technology that's been around for\na while.\n\n238\n00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.640\nAll right, so\nwhat's on the security tab here?\n\n239\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.940\nAll right, on the security\ntab essentially what we have,\n\n240\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.170\nour predefined classifications\ncalled zones, right?\n\n241\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.830\nAnd depending on how much you trust,\nthe URLs, uniform resource locators,\n\n242\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.010\nlet's get the technical jargon out of\nthe way, the websites that you visit.\n\n243\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.130\nDepending on the level of\ntrust you have is where\n\n244\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.310\nyou are gonna put these websites in\nthese predefined classifications, right?\n\n245\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.290\nSo, let's talk about right?\n\n246\n00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.610\nWe have these different zones, right?\n\n247\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.180\nAnd you can see, Select a zone to view or\nchange the security settings.\n\n248\n00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.960\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nleave the defaults because remember,\n\n249\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.580\nhelp desk, a lot of times your\nend-users do not do this, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.400\nBut there are times when you have\nto do this because sometimes, well,\n\n251\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.320\nInternet Explorer goes\na little bit too strict.\n\n252\n00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.670\nAnd you trust the website and\nyou need to view things.\n\n253\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.740\nAnd because Internet Explorer says,\nI'm not sure if I should trust that.\n\n254\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.190\nIt blocks the interactions\nof certain websites.\n\n255\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.550\nI've had to do this Dan in\na company that I'd worked for\n\n256\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.420\nwhere we had military coming in.\n\n257\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.550\nAnd they had to go to a .gov website.\n\n258\n00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.172\nAnd it just happened to be that there were\ncertain things that were running on that\n\n259\n00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:41.130\n.gov site.\n\n260\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.760\nAnd it has nothing malicious at all.\n\n261\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.113\nBut because Internet Explorer didn't\ntrust it, it was blocking that and it was\n\n262\n00:12:47.113 --> 00:12:50.779\nhindering their experience, so you can see\nthat you might have to do this, all right?\n\n263\n00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:55.401\nSo, Internet, this is where really\nalmost all websites go that\n\n264\n00:12:55.401 --> 00:13:00.210\naren't in either trusted sites or\nrestricted sites, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.764\nIf you don't personally define these as\na trusted site or a restricted site and\n\n266\n00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:09.400\nwe'll get to those in a second, every\nother site's gonna go here, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.850\nAnd what you can see here is\nthat we have different levels.\n\n268\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.925\nI'll talk about the levels coming up.\n\n269\n00:13:14.925 --> 00:13:18.982\nThe next thing we have is what's known\nas the Local Intranet Zone, all right?\n\n270\n00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:23.705\nThe Local Intranet Zone essentially is all\nsites that are essentially owned by your\n\n271\n00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:24.792\ncompany, right?\n\n272\n00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:26.758\nNow, how do they get defined in here?\n\n273\n00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:30.270\nWell, some of them can get\ndefined automatically.\n\n274\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.292\nAnd you can see automatically\ndetect these sites.\n\n275\n00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.679\nYou can see I just choose sites and\nyou can really do this for\n\n276\n00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.492\nevery single one of these different zones.\n\n277\n00:13:37.492 --> 00:13:43.661\nBut here's another thing,\nif you aren't using a fully qualified URL,\n\n278\n00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:48.427\nlet's say we're doing https//dc01,\nall right?\n\n279\n00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.565\nOr iis, right?\n\n280\n00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:52.910\nSo that's your web server.\n\n281\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.240\nIt says that isn't a full URL,\nthat's a single lookup name,\n\n282\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.790\nand what it means is,\nyou're on your local intranet site.\n\n283\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.657\nSo it sees it isn't a fully qualified\ndomain name, it says it's gotta be\n\n284\n00:14:05.657 --> 00:14:08.530\nan intranet site because you can't\nget to it over the Internet that way.\n\n285\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.455\nSo I'll go ahead and\nput it here, all right?\n\n286\n00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:15.074\nNow, keep in mind,\nyou're gonna want some kind of medium\n\n287\n00:14:15.074 --> 00:14:20.860\nlevel of trust with any site that\nis in the local intranet site.\n\n288\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.240\nThen we have trusted sites, and\nhere's where you've gotta be careful.\n\n289\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.440\nYou have to trust these sites, right?\n\n290\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.740\nUse this very sparingly,\nI honestly would say restrict this.\n\n291\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.575\nThere are some sites\nthat are here by default.\n\n292\n00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:34.548\n[LAUGH] No, they're not.\n\n293\n00:14:34.548 --> 00:14:35.093\n&gt;&gt; Lots of them.\n\n294\n00:14:35.093 --> 00:14:36.303\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lots of them, right?\n\n295\n00:14:36.303 --> 00:14:41.520\nAnd then one of the things you can see\nis that they require HTTPS by default.\n\n296\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.610\nYou will see, sometimes, that you'll find\nsome Microsoft websites in here, and\n\n297\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.250\nthat's because you're going\nspecifically to a Microsoft\n\n298\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.960\nwebsite that's owned by Microsoft.\n\n299\n00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.150\nSo it has a certain level of trust here.\n\n300\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.310\nBut keep in mind that by default it does\nrequire an encrypted secure communication.\n\n301\n00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.330\nThat could cause problems.\n\n302\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.140\nThere's been times when I actually\nhave to clear that check mark and\n\n303\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.040\nchoose to actually get something\ninto the trusted site.\n\n304\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.670\nUse it very sparingly.\n\n305\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.010\nYou have to make sure you realize\n\n306\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.860\nthat that website isn't\ngonna harm your computer.\n\n307\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes, I had to actually come in\nhere quite a bit in my career because\n\n308\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.600\nwe had agents that work for\nan insurance company.\n\n309\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.290\nThe agents didn't just quote insurance for\nus, they quoted insurance for Blue Cross\n\n310\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.670\nand Florida Cyprus and all these other\ndifferent insurance companies, right?\n\n311\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.260\nStuff that we didn't do.\n\n312\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.230\nSo every now and then I say every now and\nthen, probably daily.\n\n313\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.940\nThey'd call up and\nsay I can't get to such and such website.\n\n314\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.770\nI'm trying to get on Blue Cross and it's\nsaying denied or whatever, can't find.\n\n315\n00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.850\nAnd I would have to come in here and\nput list, after list, after list.\n\n316\n00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.500\nAnd then Blue Cross would add third party\nstuff to their site that they redirect\n\n317\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.800\nthem and add that because\nthey're gonna access that.\n\n318\n00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.720\nThis is something you will probably do a\nlot of in a help desk setting if you're in\n\n319\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.077\na corporate environment.\n\n320\n00:15:54.077 --> 00:15:57.359\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you might ask yourself,\nwhy would I do this I just use Chrome?\n\n321\n00:15:57.359 --> 00:16:02.177\nWell, it's because a lot of\nthe business base systems are Windows.\n\n322\n00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:03.940\nSo they already have\nInternet Explorer built in.\n\n323\n00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.900\n&gt;&gt; And they like the ability to control\nInternet Explorer through group policy.\n\n324\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.821\n&gt;&gt; Very good point because I\ndidn't even think about that.\n\n325\n00:16:09.821 --> 00:16:13.860\nAbsolutely you define those configuration\nsettings inside your corporate\n\n326\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.750\nenvironments.\n\n327\n00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.350\nAnd then the administrators can really\nlock them down if they need to,\n\n328\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.700\ngreat point.\n\n329\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:24.610\nThe last one, this is interesting,\nI have a conflicted view on this, right.\n\n330\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.600\nRestricted sites, this zone is for\n\n331\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.670\nwebsites that might damage\nyour computer or your files.\n\n332\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.670\nAll right, so here's why [LAUGH] here's\nwhy I have a conflicted view on this.\n\n333\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:43.090\nThe easiest way to restrict these sites,\ndon't go to them, all right?\n\n334\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.947\nI mean, that's really what\nit comes down to, right?\n\n335\n00:16:44.947 --> 00:16:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Why would you go to a site that you\nknow for a fact will harm your computer?\n\n336\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.324\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n\n337\n00:16:50.324 --> 00:16:51.614\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n338\n00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:55.784\n&gt;&gt; I've got a conflicted view on this, but\nat least it gives you the ability, again,\n\n339\n00:16:55.784 --> 00:16:56.984\nto control it, right?\n\n340\n00:16:56.984 --> 00:16:59.280\nThe best way to control this,\nis just don't go.\n\n341\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what it is?\n\n342\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.990\nIt's for just like what we were\ntalking about, corporate environment.\n\n343\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.200\nThere are users that don't know that\nyou shouldn't go to these sites.\n\n344\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.450\nI can push that out through\ngroup policy to all my users,\n\n345\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.100\nif they're using Internet Explorer.\n\n346\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.640\nAnd now those restricted sites are there,\nthey don't have to worry about it.\n\n347\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.252\nI don't have to worry about them going,\nbecause they can't.\n\n348\n00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:19.460\nAnd I've made that list, and\nI blacklisted it, there you go.\n\n349\n00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n350\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.050\nAll right, so those are about the sites.\n\n351\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.240\nAnd you can see that we can control them.\n\n352\n00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.920\nAgain, if I push the Site button,\nI can add these to the list.\n\n353\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.790\nNow, I do wanna talk just briefly\nabout the security levels.\n\n354\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.369\nIn fact, we'll go to the common one here\nsince it's the Internet zone, right?\n\n355\n00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:43.094\nWhen we look at the different slider,\nactually, this one doesn't work because,\n\n356\n00:17:43.094 --> 00:17:46.480\nbelieve it or not there are more\nthan just what you see here.\n\n357\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.234\nSo let me see here,\nthere we go, Internet zone.\n\n358\n00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.990\n&gt;&gt; It's a Transformer,\nmore than meets the eye.\n\n359\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.250\n&gt;&gt; More than meets the eye,\nthat's exactly it.\n\n360\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.930\nNotice that this one only\ngives you three options, but\n\n361\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.760\nif I switch to the Local Internet\nzone you'll see that there are more\n\n362\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.050\nthan just those three options.\n\n363\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.810\nAnd I just wanna briefly talk\nabout each one of these.\n\n364\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.590\nAll right, so the High level setting\nis exactly what it sounds like,\n\n365\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.880\nit's the most restrictive, right?\n\n366\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.160\nFor harmful websites,\nit is the strictest setting you have,\n\n367\n00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.060\nmost of the features are gonna\nbe disabled, all right?\n\n368\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.410\nAnd as we go down the slider view,\nagain, you all are smart and\n\n369\n00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.590\nintelligent out there,\nyou can see what's going on here, right?\n\n370\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.010\nTalk about Medium-high right,\nunsigned ActiveX controls.\n\n371\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.420\nIf Smartscreen Filter can't reach out\nto Microsoft's reputation database and\n\n372\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.140\nsay hey I know where that\nActiveX control came from,\n\n373\n00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.150\nit is going to be blocked,\na download won't happen.\n\n374\n00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.500\nWe say Medium again\n\n375\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.310\nYou start seeing prompts before\ndownloading potentially unsafe content.\n\n376\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.150\nI will tell you that Medium-low\nis the same as Medium.\n\n377\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.090\nThe difference is,\nit just doesn't prompt you.\n\n378\n00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.700\nAll right, so keep in mind, and\nthey even tell you that right there.\n\n379\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.940\nYou'll see same as Medium level\nwithout the prompts, right?\n\n380\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.200\nAnd then Low,\nyou have to be careful, again,\n\n381\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.170\nyou have to trust the site, because most\nof the safeguards will be turned off.\n\n382\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.390\nAll active content can run.\n\n383\n00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.741\nWhich gives you the ability\nessentially to damage your computer.\n\n384\n00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:19.820\nI do want to mention one thing though,\nprotected mode.\n\n385\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.819\nAll right, when we talk about\nenabling Protected Mode,\n\n386\n00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:27.079\nwhat this does is this makes sure that\nthere's a quarantined portion of memory.\n\n387\n00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:30.060\nIt's like data execution protection,\nessentially.\n\n388\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.470\nInternet Explorer can use that memory but\napplications that are coming through\n\n389\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.170\nInternet Explorer will not be allowed\nto execute information there.\n\n390\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.527\nSo it is very important.\n\n391\n00:19:39.527 --> 00:19:41.270\nAll right,\nsome of the other things that we have.\n\n392\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.044\nLet's go ahead and\nwe're going to go into the list.\n\n393\n00:19:43.044 --> 00:19:48.550\nAs far as the objectives go, I know\nwe're jumping all over the place here.\n\n394\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.470\nBut notice that we have on the general tab\nwe have the ability to set the Home Page.\n\n395\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.720\nIn fact you can see that if I was to\nfire up Internet Explorer right now\n\n396\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.840\nmy home page is Google, right?\n\n397\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.990\nAnd I see that fact right here.\n\n398\n00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:06.884\nBut if I wanted to I could\nalways type something\n\n399\n00:20:06.884 --> 00:20:11.035\nlike https then I could put itpro.tv.\n\n400\n00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:18.429\nAll right, and then what we could do is we\ncould come down here to the Apply button.\n\n401\n00:20:18.429 --> 00:20:20.348\nI could apply that say, OK.\n\n402\n00:20:20.348 --> 00:20:24.031\nIf I wanted to and\nwhen I go back to Internet Explorer and\n\n403\n00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:28.856\nupdate the home button,\nyou will see that it should flip over to.\n\n404\n00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:34.165\nApparently ITProTV, let's start over\nthere might have a caching issue.\n\n405\n00:20:34.165 --> 00:20:35.973\nThere we go, that caching issue there,\n\n406\n00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:38.650\nwhich we're gonna actually\nshow you from the general tab.\n\n407\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.060\nSo that leads us, I meant to do that.\n\n408\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.660\nThat leads us into our next thing,\nand let me show you again.\n\n409\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.220\nRemember, internet options we can always\nget from the little gear icon there.\n\n410\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.890\nAnd we'll go ahead, and you know what?\n\n411\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:50.870\nThat's the other thing too,\n\n412\n00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:56.360\nwhen you launch it from the run line like\nI was showing you or from Control Panel.\n\n413\n00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.820\nI don't have to have\nInternet Explorer open, so\n\n414\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.350\nthat's the other thing\nI forgot to mention.\n\n415\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.370\nWhich is why, sometimes, I like having\nthis view open cuz it doesn't lock\n\n416\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.930\nme down to having active content\nrunning in the background.\n\n417\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.620\nEspecially from a malicious\nstandpoint if you're worried about\n\n418\n00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.952\ntroubleshooting software.\n\n419\n00:21:10.952 --> 00:21:14.866\n&gt;&gt; And plus, if I'm remembering correctly\nsome features will not work correctly if\n\n420\n00:21:14.866 --> 00:21:16.917\nInternet Explorer's actually running.\n\n421\n00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:17.898\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You have to close it\n\n422\n00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:21.716\ngo into the Control Panel or however you\nlike just open up the Internet Options and\n\n423\n00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:24.267\nthen it will allow you\nto make certain changes.\n\n424\n00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:27.045\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and in fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n425\n00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:31.005\nSo if we look at the computer, notice we\ntalked about enabling Protected Mode, and\n\n426\n00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:33.265\nit says requires restarting\nInternet Explorer.\n\n427\n00:21:33.265 --> 00:21:33.765\nWell, guess what?\n\n428\n00:21:33.765 --> 00:21:36.770\nIf I apply this setting Internet Explorer\nisn't started anyway, so\n\n429\n00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.660\nI don't have to restart it.\n\n430\n00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.900\nSo yeah,\nyou're absolutely correct there, Dan.\n\n431\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.580\nAll right, so, and I closed it down.\n\n432\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.880\n&gt;&gt; That's how you close Internet Options.\n\n433\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Just a bit outside, ball one there.\n\n434\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.112\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\nlet's rerun that, and\n\n435\n00:21:49.112 --> 00:21:52.531\nlaunch that back up or\nit's gonna be a very short episode.\n\n436\n00:21:52.531 --> 00:21:56.830\nAll right, so Internet, again,\nback here to our internet Options, right?\n\n437\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.020\nWe have the ability here to start up,\nright?\n\n438\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.480\nWe can say where do we wanna start up.\n\n439\n00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.240\nWe can define our tabs.\n\n440\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.290\nAlso delete our browsing history as well.\n\n441\n00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.500\nAnd you can delete the browsing\nhistory on exit if you want.\n\n442\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.250\nIf you choose delete\nyou get the ability to\n\n443\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.280\ndefine exactly what it is\nthat you wanna delete.\n\n444\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.035\nYou can always see That the first four\nhere, if I quit moving around there,\n\n445\n00:22:20.035 --> 00:22:22.390\nyou'll see are checked by default.\n\n446\n00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.119\nBut you could always modify and\nchange these.\n\n447\n00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:27.235\nAll right,\nyou can also change the appearance, right?\n\n448\n00:22:27.235 --> 00:22:30.587\nI can change the color and\nyou can see languages, fonts, and\n\n449\n00:22:30.587 --> 00:22:33.035\naccessibility options\nas well If I need to.\n\n450\n00:22:33.035 --> 00:22:37.715\nMaybe colors,\nI have not necessarily color blind or\n\n451\n00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:40.758\nmaybe even color blind, maybe you\nneed to see things in high contrast.\n\n452\n00:22:40.758 --> 00:22:44.530\nWell, you could also do that here inside\nof just changing the general appearance.\n\n453\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.800\nAll right, so we also have other things\ntoo that we need to worry about.\n\n454\n00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.627\nImagine if you want to for\n\n455\n00:22:50.627 --> 00:22:55.242\ninstance maybe you wanna define\nhow websites can use cookies.\n\n456\n00:22:55.242 --> 00:22:59.701\nMaybe you're worried about things like\nlocation services and you wanna define\n\n457\n00:22:59.701 --> 00:23:04.660\nwhether location services are enabled or\ndisabled, pop up blocker if you will.\n\n458\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.300\nHow are the toolbars and\nextensions gonna be handled?\n\n459\n00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.587\nWell, that can all be done right\nhere from the privacy tab.\n\n460\n00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:13.676\nIf we switch over to the privacy\ntab you'll see that we have well\n\n461\n00:23:13.676 --> 00:23:15.170\nthe Internet Zone, right?\n\n462\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.750\nAnd you can see some of the things\nhere blocks the third-party\n\n463\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.980\ncookies that don't have\na compact privacy policy, right?\n\n464\n00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.291\nIf we wanted to, we can get really strict.\n\n465\n00:23:24.291 --> 00:23:27.540\nAnd I'm pretty sure we can\nblock all cookies, yeah.\n\n466\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:32.051\nAgain, keep in mind that this will\nkind of modify how your websites\n\n467\n00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:34.080\nare gonna interact with you.\n\n468\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.023\nSometimes it might be required.\n\n469\n00:23:36.023 --> 00:23:40.072\nAnd another aspect, it might reduce\nthe functionality of the website, so\n\n470\n00:23:40.072 --> 00:23:41.110\nkeep that in mind.\n\n471\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.307\nEspecially with there being so many,\n\n472\n00:23:43.307 --> 00:23:46.612\nyou've probably seen it as\nyou visited different URLs.\n\n473\n00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:49.955\nI think in Europe right now,\nthey have a big policy that says hey\n\n474\n00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:54.134\nif they use cookies, they have to put\na banner up there that lets you know, so.\n\n475\n00:23:54.134 --> 00:23:58.764\nAnd the fact that you're disabling\ncookies could stop advertisements.\n\n476\n00:23:58.764 --> 00:24:00.730\nAnd you might say, well,\nthat's a good thing.\n\n477\n00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.646\nWell, some companies don't like that and\nthey'll tell you right away,\n\n478\n00:24:03.646 --> 00:24:07.084\nif you're blocking our cookies, if you're\nnot allowing our advertisements to run,\n\n479\n00:24:07.084 --> 00:24:07.897\nwe don't get paid.\n\n480\n00:24:07.897 --> 00:24:10.876\nWe can't keep this website free for\nyou and\n\n481\n00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:13.780\nthey won't let you see any content on it.\n\n482\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.470\nSo again, keep in mind, that yes it\nis beneficial in some cases, but\n\n483\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.510\nin some cases it also ruins\nthe functionality of the website, and\n\n484\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.190\nthat may or may not be a problem for you.\n\n485\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.590\nRemember I said location services, again,\nwe can control that here, Pop-up Blocker.\n\n486\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.290\nIn private browsing, keep in mind what\nin private browsing is, this says,\n\n487\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.980\ndon't store the history in the browser.\n\n488\n00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.900\nThis does nothing to stop your ISP,\nyour workplace, or\n\n489\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.030\nthe websites that you visit\nfrom seeing you where there.\n\n490\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:46.029\nIt just means don't store that information\nlocally within Internet Explorer\n\n491\n00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:48.006\ntemporary files, all right.\n\n492\n00:24:48.006 --> 00:24:52.382\nCouple of the other things I wanna\ntalk about when it comes to your\n\n493\n00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:53.770\nInternet options.\n\n494\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.249\nAgain, called internet properties\nif you will in this dialogue box.\n\n495\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.010\nLet's see, what else, programs, right?\n\n496\n00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.640\nSo programs again,\nhow do you open links, right?\n\n497\n00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.110\nLet Internet Explorer essentially decide,\nright?\n\n498\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.670\nWe could say,\nAlways in Internet Explorer or\n\n499\n00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.140\nopen them on the desktop\nin Internet Explorer.\n\n500\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.560\nWe can manage the extensions, too.\n\n501\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.860\nNow extensions can also be\nmanaged from the browser,\n\n502\n00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.800\nfrom the gear icon that I showed you,\nthe tools icon.\n\n503\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.002\nHTML editor if you want, I can set\nwhich programs that are gonna work\n\n504\n00:25:27.002 --> 00:25:30.111\nwith the different\nInternet Explorer services.\n\n505\n00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:32.217\nFile associations, this is kind of cool,\n\n506\n00:25:32.217 --> 00:25:35.890\nchoose the file type that you want\nInternet Explorer to open with.\n\n507\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.022\nThere's other ways that we set this,\nnot just for Internet Explorer but,\n\n508\n00:25:40.022 --> 00:25:42.855\nwe set this for\nthe entire computing environment.\n\n509\n00:25:42.855 --> 00:25:45.725\nIf I was to drop down\nto control panel again,\n\n510\n00:25:45.725 --> 00:25:49.255\nand go to programs we could\ndo programs and features.\n\n511\n00:25:49.255 --> 00:25:54.110\nAnd then, that's not it sorry,\ndefault programs over here.\n\n512\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.080\nAnd I can choose default programs or\nI can associate file types or\n\n513\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.480\nprotocols with the program.\n\n514\n00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.880\nSo this is for the whole entire\nplatform versus right here,\n\n515\n00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.480\nbeing the file associations\nessentially that are just relative to\n\n516\n00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.875\nInternet Explorer's Interaction\nwith you in the operating system.\n\n517\n00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:13.725\nAll right, so that's programs,\nlet's see, okay, so\n\n518\n00:26:13.725 --> 00:26:17.005\nthe last one that I wanna\ntalk about here is advanced.\n\n519\n00:26:17.005 --> 00:26:20.157\nAnd advanced is exactly\nwhat it sounds like, right?\n\n520\n00:26:20.157 --> 00:26:25.457\nAdvance essentially gives you the ability\nto fine tune your Internet Explorer\n\n521\n00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:26.327\nexperience.\n\n522\n00:26:26.327 --> 00:26:29.677\nIt gives you the really fine grain\nsettings, and you could scroll,\n\n523\n00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:31.337\nthere are a bunch of them here.\n\n524\n00:26:31.337 --> 00:26:36.337\nSo for instance, if you want more\nsecurity and you don't want, let's say,\n\n525\n00:26:36.337 --> 00:26:39.300\nInternet Explorer to\nbe allowed to use SSL.\n\n526\n00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.410\nYou wanted to be able to use transports\nlayer security rather than falling\n\n527\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.660\nback to a weaker encryption and\ncipher string?\n\n528\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.476\nWell, look here I can do that,\nI can say, and\n\n529\n00:26:47.476 --> 00:26:52.445\nby default you could see it is turned off\nor maybe for the functionality purposes\n\n530\n00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:57.294\nyou do have a website that is still using\nsomething like SSL over TLS, right?\n\n531\n00:26:57.294 --> 00:27:00.752\nWeaker encryption method, maybe that's\ngood for you, maybe it's not, right?\n\n532\n00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:03.000\nThe one that's-\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, [LAUGH]\n\n533\n00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.339\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, right?\n\n534\n00:27:04.339 --> 00:27:06.646\n[LAUGH] But again-\n&gt;&gt; A weak encryption, bad.\n\n535\n00:27:06.646 --> 00:27:07.293\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n536\n00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:11.301\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you're in an enviroment that\nit was built around and older technology,\n\n537\n00:27:11.301 --> 00:27:15.155\nand they have yet to upgrade it, so you'll\nhave to support it from time to time.\n\n538\n00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:15.714\n&gt;&gt; Compatibility, yeah.\n\n539\n00:27:15.714 --> 00:27:18.266\n&gt;&gt; But definitely as fast as\nyou can get away from it.\n\n540\n00:27:18.266 --> 00:27:20.818\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nthat's right, run, run Forrest.\n\n541\n00:27:20.818 --> 00:27:21.885\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n542\n00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:25.729\n&gt;&gt; Here's one of the ones that is\nreally cool that I wanna show you, and\n\n543\n00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:29.245\nthis is doing a reset of\nInternet Explorer settings, right?\n\n544\n00:27:29.245 --> 00:27:31.670\nRemember one of the things\nthat I told you is that\n\n545\n00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.530\nyou might have to get in here because\nyou have malware or you've got somebody.\n\n546\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.907\nAnd Dan you've mentioned this before,\nusers of all click it so\n\n547\n00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.719\nnow start changing things and stuff.\n\n548\n00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:44.173\nAnd a lot of times we can control\nthis through her policy like\n\n549\n00:27:44.173 --> 00:27:48.664\nDan mentioned if they're using Internet\nExplorer but if that ever happens,\n\n550\n00:27:48.664 --> 00:27:52.326\nif you ever get malware and\nmalware likes to read redirectors or\n\n551\n00:27:52.326 --> 00:27:55.253\nmaybe even modify your toolbars and\nextensions.\n\n552\n00:27:55.253 --> 00:27:58.327\nOr if you happen to be in one of those\nones that downloads every piece of\n\n553\n00:27:58.327 --> 00:28:01.295\nsoftware that puts 115 toolbars,\nand it takes 30 minutes for\n\n554\n00:28:01.295 --> 00:28:02.786\nyour Internet Explorer to open.\n\n555\n00:28:02.786 --> 00:28:03.568\n&gt;&gt; Those are my favorite.\n\n556\n00:28:03.568 --> 00:28:04.827\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n557\n00:28:04.827 --> 00:28:07.080\nthose are always great in\na help desk situation.\n\n558\n00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.620\nWhat you can do is you can come in\nhere and you can do advanced reset.\n\n559\n00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.950\nAnd you can even do,\nif you'll notice the reset,\n\n560\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:17.260\ndisable toolbars and add-ons, default\nbrowser settings, privacy settings, right,\n\n561\n00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.670\nthe advanced options, tabbed browsers.\n\n562\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.732\nAnd then you could also do things like\ndeleting the personal settings which is\n\n563\n00:28:23.732 --> 00:28:24.294\nwhat I do,\n\n564\n00:28:24.294 --> 00:28:28.186\nespecially because it talks about\nsome of the temporary Internet files.\n\n565\n00:28:28.186 --> 00:28:32.945\nA lot of times, viruses like to put\nthings in your temp files, write the kit,\n\n566\n00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:34.349\nand continually run.\n\n567\n00:28:34.349 --> 00:28:37.990\nKeep in mind that this does you have\nto restart the computer, right?\n\n568\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.650\nSo if I do a reset here,\nyou'll see that it goes through,\n\n569\n00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.180\nruns a little script in the background\nthat was in command prompt running.\n\n570\n00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.740\nAnd it's clearing everything\nin the background more so\n\n571\n00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.430\nthan what you see just in these little\ncheck marks, which we've kind of tackled\n\n572\n00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:54.810\nand when we looked at command prompt,\nand now we choose close.\n\n573\n00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.650\nAnd keep in mind that it\nreally isn't done yet,\n\n574\n00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.810\nbecause I'd have to restart the machine\nand then it'll finish basically\n\n575\n00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.530\ncleaning up all of those temporary\nfiles and resetting it back to anew.\n\n576\n00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.920\nNow that's a little bit, or a lot a bit I\nshould say, about your internet options.\n\n577\n00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.660\nHowever, keep in mind,\n\n578\n00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.470\nit's good to know because you might\nbe supporting Internet Explorer.\n\n579\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.440\nHowever, we've only kind of scratched\nthe surface on some of the different\n\n580\n00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.750\nProper Control Panel Utilities we have,\nbut Dan is looking at me and\n\n581\n00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.060\nit looks like I talk a little\nbit too much on this one.\n\n582\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.510\n&gt;&gt; You're a little bit out of time for\nthis episode but definitely come back.\n\n583\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.690\nWe have a few more tools for you to\ngo through and see how they work and\n\n584\n00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.900\nhow will they benefit us as technicians.\n\n585\n00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.550\nSo, come and back for part two.\n\n586\n00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.440\nAs of this one it does look like\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n587\n00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.660\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n588\n00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n589\n00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.620\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n590\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:45.748\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:29:45.748 -->

00:00:11.869\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.783\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:16.662\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:18.207\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.207 --> 00:00:21.096\nin today's episode we are moving\non with more in our A+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:24.592\nHaving a good time doing that and\njoining us back in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:27.853\nagain lending his self to us so\nthat we might learn from him.\n\n10\n00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:29.360\nOur good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.690\nWes, glad to have you again man.\n\n12\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.270\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.060\nGonna be continuing on in\nControl Panel utilities.\n\n14\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.779\nI gotta say that right because we've\nbeen joking around off camera.\n\n15\n00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:39.208\nI've been saying utilitities,\n\n16\n00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:41.923\nyou watch I'm gonna end up throwing\nthat here in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:43.251\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I trust you will.\n\n18\n00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:43.803\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.803 --> 00:00:46.235\nWe'll make our own contributions\nto the English language.\n\n20\n00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:47.218\nMerriam-Webster eat your heart out.\n\n21\n00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:48.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n22\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.629\nSo speaking of utilities,\nlet's go ahead and let's continue on.\n\n23\n00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.432\nIn the first part, well, we really only\ntalked about [LAUGH] one utility, and\n\n24\n00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:58.960\nit's kind of important because it\ncomes down to web browsing, right?\n\n25\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.190\nWe talked about the Internet Explorer\noptions, Internet options as they\n\n26\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.800\ncall them, but they're directly\nrelated to Internet Explorer.\n\n27\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.220\nNow we're gonna move on and some of the\nnext things that we're gonna talk about is\n\n28\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.680\nwell some of the display settings.\n\n29\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.482\nAnd for the most part these\nreally haven't changed.\n\n30\n00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:15.879\nWe're gonna kinda walk you through\nthe different operating systems, just so\n\n31\n00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.071\nyou can see the interface.\n\n32\n00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:21.372\nAgain the interface is important cuz\nkeep in mind In some of the questions,\n\n33\n00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:24.991\nthey might have an exhibit that\nlet's you look at something and\n\n34\n00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.660\nmaybe a portion of it might be clickable.\n\n35\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.680\nBut you might not get that benefit, right.\n\n36\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.690\nBecause if I can see an exhibit right,\nI can kinda deduce what's going on here.\n\n37\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.600\nBut if I only have a text based answer,\nyou better just deuce that you know\n\n38\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.310\nexactly how to get there before you\never get into the exam booth and\n\n39\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.080\nthat is important.\n\n40\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.503\n&gt;&gt; And you know what you might\nthink that that's crazy, right?\n\n41\n00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.435\nWhy would they do that, they're just\ntrying to make things difficult and\n\n42\n00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:49.462\nI would have probably been in that exact\nsame camp up until I actually started\n\n43\n00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:50.870\nworking in the field.\n\n44\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.840\nAnd sometimes like,\n\n45\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.290\nwell a lot of times we have remote\ndesktop type of software, right?\n\n46\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.140\nVNC, things of that nature.\n\n47\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.340\nYou log in, you do the thing and\nyou're done.\n\n48\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.120\nBut sometimes that doesn't work and\nyou have to walk them through it step and\n\n49\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.830\nyou have to go okay in the top right hand\ncorner there should be a button that says\n\n50\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.050\ncategories or classic view category view,\nclassic view click that where's that?\n\n51\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.120\nOkay it's gonna be underneath the red X.\n\n52\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.360\nYou're gonna have to really be able to\npaint them a picture and walk them through\n\n53\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.320\nit if you can't actually log in or be\nthere physically to do the work your self.\n\n54\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.860\nSo don't think that this is outside of the\nscope of something that you would do as\n\n55\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.070\nan A+ technician.\n\n56\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.590\nYou're almost guaranteed to\nactually have to do this.\n\n57\n00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.974\n&gt;&gt; Flying like Stevie Wonder\nwith a drivers license, right?\n\n58\n00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:33.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.614\nIt's frustrating, and it's hard.\n\n60\n00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:35.310\n&gt;&gt; You have to know.\n\n61\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.942\nExactly.\n\n62\n00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:36.646\n&gt;&gt; But you have to do it.\n\n63\n00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:39.455\n&gt;&gt; And if you think about it,\nyeah, it's frustrating on you but\n\n64\n00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:41.298\nit's also frustrating on the end user.\n\n65\n00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:43.088\nBecause the end user wants to help and\n\n66\n00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:46.168\nif they feel helpless then it\njust elevates the whole problem.\n\n67\n00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:46.695\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n68\n00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:47.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:48.004\n&gt;&gt; A lot.\n\n70\n00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:48.588\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't help that's for sure.\n\n71\n00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:49.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:49.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.751\n&gt;&gt; I know again that's one of the good\n\n74\n00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.538\nthings about having you here on this one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.086\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Dan's worked in help desk for\n\n76\n00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:56.761\nmany years now.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n77\n00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.540\n&gt;&gt; So keep in mind that we're gonna show\n\n78\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.560\nyou the different interfaces.\n\n79\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.850\nLet's go ahead and I'll tell you\nwhat we'll dive right in here, and\n\n80\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.350\nwe're gonna dive into Windows Vista first,\nright.\n\n81\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.210\nAnd we're gonna go to appearance and\npersonalization.\n\n82\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.740\nWe're already in,\nif you will, the Start menu.\n\n83\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.010\nWe've gone, or excuse me, we've gone to\nStart, we've gone to Control Panel and\n\n84\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.860\nin our personalization, you see that\nwe do get some of the options here.\n\n85\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.750\nNow, I want you to see that,\nhonestly, when we look here,\n\n86\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.220\nI don't see a lot of the things that\nI'm supposed to be seeing, right?\n\n87\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.380\nIt's a little bit different,\n\n88\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.390\nbecause if you go to Control Panel in\nWindows 7 and you go to Appearance and\n\n89\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.130\nPersonalization, notice that I\nget this display option, right?\n\n90\n00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.360\nWell, that's kinda interesting, because\nwell I don't see it from appearance and\n\n91\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.260\npersonalization right here.\n\n92\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.420\nSo that is one of the things,\n\n93\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.670\none of the reasons we want you to be\naware of display settings, right?\n\n94\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.090\nNotice that it isn't here.\n\n95\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.380\nIt is a little bit different.\n\n96\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.310\nYou're gonna look at personalization and\n\n97\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.510\nyou're gonna get these\ndisplay settings down here.\n\n98\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.881\nNotice it is different, right?\n\n99\n00:03:56.881 --> 00:04:00.200\nSo, that again, is one of the things\nthat you do have to keep in mind.\n\n100\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.040\nAnd let me go ahead and\njust kind of recap that.\n\n101\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.220\nIf we back out to Appearance and\nPersonalization and\n\n102\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.740\nwe go back to Control Panel Home,\njust keep in mind.\n\n103\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.780\nStill the same location as far as\nAppearance and Personalization, but\n\n104\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.640\nagain, notice that we don't\nget that display option.\n\n105\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.280\nAnd we have to go to Personalization, and\n\n106\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.700\nthen your display settings\nare down here at the bottom.\n\n107\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.540\nAnd this is the display settings\ninside of Vista, right?\n\n108\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.194\nSo It is a little bit different where in\nWindows 7, if we go to Control Panel &gt;\n\n109\n00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:31.360\nAppearance and Personalization,\nnotice right there at the top.\n\n110\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.580\nWe have display.\n\n111\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.340\nAnd the same thing goes with Windows 8 and\n8.1, really.\n\n112\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.120\nWe go to Control Panel, we go to\nAppearance and Personalization, and yes,\n\n113\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.200\nI know wash, rinse, repeat,\nrepetitive nature here.\n\n114\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.020\nBut we also have\nthe Display Settings right here.\n\n115\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.410\nNow, what can we do inside\nof the Display Settings?\n\n116\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.530\nWell, obviously we can modify aspects and\nproperties of the display.\n\n117\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.680\nBut I also want you to know that we\ncan do things like, for instance,\n\n118\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.820\nwe can enlarge parts of the screen\nwith what's known as the magnifier.\n\n119\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.020\nNow the magnifier tool is also in\nthe Ease of Access Center, but\n\n120\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.620\nwe can also change things like\nthe text size and the scaling.\n\n121\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.761\nThis is where in fact, I think, Dan, you\nhad mentioned this in an earlier episode,\n\n122\n00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.438\nwhere we're talking about\ntroubleshooting in the hardware section.\n\n123\n00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:19.090\nWe talked troubleshooting monitors and\nwhy the resolution might be off.\n\n124\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.408\nSome times when you adjust\nthese scaling sizes and\n\n125\n00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:27.010\nthe text sizes applications that\nopen up wont be displayed right.\n\n126\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.770\nYou're gonna wonder,\nwhat the heck is going on?\n\n127\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.160\nThen you realize that in your zoom\noptions, you aren't zoomed but yet\n\n128\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.030\nit's still off center.\n\n129\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.850\nSo keep that in mind that\nthat can happen here.\n\n130\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.080\nYou can also do things like\nadjusting your resolution.\n\n131\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.830\nColor depth, we can change and\ncalibrate our color.\n\n132\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.150\nWe can also adjust things like\nthe Clear Type text, all right.\n\n133\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.760\nNow you also have the ability if you want,\nyou can for instance,\n\n134\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.060\nif you go to Adjust Resolution,\n\n135\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.290\nyou also have the advanced settings\nhere that you can control.\n\n136\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.930\nAnd advanced settings right, when we get\ninto advance settings, this is where you\n\n137\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.693\nsee more of the properties of\nthe monitor itself for instance.\n\n138\n00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:05.700\nYou look at the adapter,\nwe can look at the adapter properties.\n\n139\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.780\nSame thing that we could see\ninside of device manager.\n\n140\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.680\nBut one of the things I want you to know\nis that even though this really isn't\n\n141\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.750\ntoo much for us today, you can also\nmodify, not only things like color depth,\n\n142\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.800\nbut you can modify things\nlike your refresh rate.\n\n143\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.130\nNow, this used to be a thing you would\nhave to know in the earlier A+ days,\n\n144\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.350\nin some of the earlier\nexams that I used to teach,\n\n145\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.460\nyou used to have to know a little\nbit more about the refresh rate.\n\n146\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.030\nWe already talked about that being\na characteristic of your monitors.\n\n147\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.110\nRemember, refresh rate Is how\noften the screen repaints itself.\n\n148\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.276\nAnd anything lower than 60 hertz,\nwhat ends up happening is your eye,\n\n149\n00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.964\nyour optical nerve,\nit senses that it isn't a static picture,\n\n150\n00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.240\nthat it's actually being repainted.\n\n151\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.050\nAnd it can pick up on that and\nit can really give you headaches.\n\n152\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.320\nOne of the great things for today,\nthis was more with your CRT monitors,\n\n153\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.710\nI want you ladies and\ngentleman to see something out here.\n\n154\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.950\nIt really isn't something that\nyou can change too much, right.\n\n155\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.670\nNotice that this says hey what's\nthe native settings for this monitor.\n\n156\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.590\nIn this case a laptop that I'm on.\n\n157\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.630\nAnd I don't have the ability\nto change anything.\n\n158\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.067\nSo that's really going to be more specific\nto the monitor that you're sitting in\n\n159\n00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:15.700\nfront of, but you really don't have any\nreason to change it below 60 Hertz anymore\n\n160\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.859\neven though you might be able to set them,\nyou might not.\n\n161\n00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:22.351\nAll right, so that is a little bit about,\nin Control Panel if you will,\n\n162\n00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.760\nthat's a little bit about some\nof your display settings.\n\n163\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.760\nNow the other thing that we also have the\nability to do is, we have User Accounts,\n\n164\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.430\nall right now, this depends on\nwhat Control Panel you're in.\n\n165\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.710\nSo for instance, if we're in Windows 7,\nyou'll notice that it says,\n\n166\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.520\nUser Accounts and Family Safety,\nthat's important.\n\n167\n00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.380\nAgain, I am picking semantics, because\nagain, they might ask you to troubleshoot\n\n168\n00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.980\na Windows 7 machine, and if they say\non the exam, Start &gt; Control Panel &gt;\n\n169\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.340\nUser Accounts, that isn't the right\nanswer for Windows 7, right?\n\n170\n00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.394\nThat's the right answer for Windows 8.1.\n\n171\n00:07:55.394 --> 00:07:58.518\nNow, semantics aside,\nif we get in here in User Accounts,\n\n172\n00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:02.279\nkeep in mind, this is obviously where\nwe can manage our user accounts.\n\n173\n00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:06.439\nNow, we also showed you in a previous\nepisode about computer management and\n\n174\n00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:09.169\nthe fact that inside of\ncomputer management, and\n\n175\n00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:11.710\nI kinda wanna just recall\nthis to the top here.\n\n176\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.640\nIf I get to computer management because\n\n177\n00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.270\ntwo different locations to\nmanage your user accounts.\n\n178\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.000\nAnd one is local users and groups,\nthe other one in here is user accounts.\n\n179\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.160\nHowever I do want you to keep in\nmind that with user accounts here,\n\n180\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.230\nunderstand that the one thing\nyou can't do in user accounts is\n\n181\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.420\nmake any modifications,\ncreating or modifying groups.\n\n182\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.080\nThat has to be in computer management.\n\n183\n00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.790\nIt could be something that\nyou either get right or\n\n184\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.090\nget wrong on the exam based on whether\nyou are aware of it, so I would be.\n\n185\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.470\nNow, when we get into user accounts\n\n186\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.580\nwe have the ability to do a couple\nof different things, right?\n\n187\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.370\nYou can change your own account.\n\n188\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.530\nIf you're managing other accounts you\nhave to be an administrative user.\n\n189\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.960\nRemember you're making potential\nchanges to the core functionality of\n\n190\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.750\nthe operating system, so this does require\n\n191\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.290\nyou to be an administrator in order\nto manage these other accounts.\n\n192\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.090\nNow noticed that I can add accounts here\nright in an earlier episode we created\n\n193\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.740\nDan an account here too.\n\n194\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.030\nAnd if I wanted to I could see things\nlike the properties of his account and\n\n195\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.270\ngroup membership.\n\n196\n00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.840\nNoticed that I told you that you\ncan't really modify groups here\n\n197\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.170\none exception to the rule,\nand again big exampler.\n\n198\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.190\nI can move him from a standard\nuser to an administrator.\n\n199\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.510\nLet's say when I first created this\naccount, I already know Dan knows\n\n200\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.160\nthe insides and outs of this computer and\nI know this truthfully, right.\n\n201\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.570\nI say, well I made him a standard users,\n\n202\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.520\nthat was my fault here,\nI need him to be an administrator.\n\n203\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.840\nNow I get the ability if I want to\nbasically make him an administrator.\n\n204\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.951\nNow he's part of the administrator account\nand you do have the ability to make\n\n205\n00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:55.467\nmodifications here to some of the basic\nusers that you find, in Windows 8.1.\n\n206\n00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:58.850\nNow, moving back over the user accounts\nand family safety in Windows 7.\n\n207\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.650\nYou 'll see that if we choose, user\naccount as well, we can also manage other\n\n208\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.380\naccount here too and I could let's say for\ninstance let's create a new user here.\n\n209\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.170\nAnd all created new started user,\nwhat you call this 202.\n\n210\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.170\nWe will create the account and\n\n211\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.550\nthen maybe I want to do some\nbasic management all right?\n\n212\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.470\nNotice that one of the things that I\ncan do is change the account type here.\n\n213\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.450\nBut there is a big difference\nin Windows 7 all right?\n\n214\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:33.480\nWindows 7 I told you does not give\nthe ability to modify the user in groups,\n\n215\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.550\nif you will, it's only in Windows\n8.1 that they gave you a way that\n\n216\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.600\nyou can do this outside of local users and\ngroups so, do keep that in mind.\n\n217\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.110\nWindows 8.1, yeah I have the ability,\nI can modify it.\n\n218\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.100\nUp until Windows 8.1, Windows Vista, and\nWindows 7, it's either a standard user or\n\n219\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.700\nit is an administrative user account.\n\n220\n00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.425\nAll right, so that being said,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n221\n00:10:57.425 --> 00:10:59.302\nlet's move on to some of\nthe other things that you can do.\n\n222\n00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:01.983\nNow, there's a couple different\nways that you can do this next\n\n223\n00:11:01.983 --> 00:11:04.050\nfunctionality that we're gonna talk about.\n\n224\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.469\nAnd we'll show you a couple\nof the different interfaces.\n\n225\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.740\nInside of your control panel\nif we go start, control panel.\n\n226\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.380\nAnd then we go to where is\nthat going to be located.\n\n227\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.610\nBelieve it is in system and security.\n\n228\n00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.750\nAnd you know what it is not in system and\nsecurity.\n\n229\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.390\nWhere did that end up?\n\n230\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.100\n&gt;&gt; Appearance and Personalization.\n\n231\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n232\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.530\nAnd there's another example of a classic\nexample of why I usually switch\n\n233\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.670\nto the non category view.\n\n234\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n235\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe have Folder Options here and\n\n236\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.680\nI'm gonna show you another way that I\nam so used to getting into this that\n\n237\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.320\nI don't even bother with the Control Panel\nbut we have to really show [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.605\nyou the exam objectives and, well,\nyou can see airball right there on camera.\n\n239\n00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.600\n[LAUGH] If i go to folder options right?\n\n240\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.630\nI get the ability obviously modifies some\nof the ways that windows explorer/file\n\n241\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:12:01.180\nexplorer depending on which operating\nsystem you're in, will be viewed.\n\n242\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.350\nNow I also want you to understand that\nthere is couple of different ways\n\n243\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.140\nthat you can get to this as well.\n\n244\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.800\nIf I open Windows Explorer\nfrom the task bar, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.870\nAnd then I go up to Organize,\nand I scroll down to Folder and\n\n246\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.820\nsearch options, I want you to know that\nit brings up the same exact menu, right?\n\n247\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.040\nSo, Folder options again,\nfrom Windows Explorer.\n\n248\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.820\nI can get to it, Organize Folder and\n\n249\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.760\nsearch options and we'll look at\nthese tabs here coming up here.\n\n250\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.370\nJust give me a moment.\n\n251\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.720\nIf I do this inside\n\n252\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.890\nWindows 8 and 8.1, again remember\nit's gonna be File Explorer.\n\n253\n00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.560\nIt's the new thing that they call it\n\n254\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.590\ntoday versus what the called it in\nWindows 7 go ahead and close this down.\n\n255\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.490\nNow you might see something\nhere that's missing.\n\n256\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.010\nNotice that I don't have that organize\nbutton here in file explorer?\n\n257\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.520\nThat's because in file explorer, they\ndecided to go with the ribbon view that is\n\n258\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.770\nreally, really close to a lot\nof the other Microsoft products.\n\n259\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:07.720\nFor instance your Office Suite,\nnotice that I have the options over here.\n\n260\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:14.610\nAnd if I choose options I can choose\nchange folder and search options.\n\n261\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.220\nNow this is important all right.\n\n262\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.630\nSo you can see that.\n\n263\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.030\nI can show libraries.\n\n264\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.460\nI can turn libraries off.\n\n265\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.240\nAgain a single-click to open\ndifferent items and stuff.\n\n266\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.320\nThe same thing with double-click.\n\n267\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.710\nBut I will tell you that you\nalso have this view tab.\n\n268\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.070\nView tab is very important and\n\n269\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.890\nhere are some things that I definitely\nwant you to be aware of for the exam.\n\n270\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.030\nAll right I can modify what you can see,\nand what you can't see,\n\n271\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.890\ncertain aspects of Windows explorer and\nfile explorer.\n\n272\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.730\nNow the great thing is the view tab here\nis pretty much the same across the board\n\n273\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.120\nhere so that you're aware of that.\n\n274\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.600\nNotice this one right here,\nshow hidden files, folders, and drives.\n\n275\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.830\nNow for the average end user you really\ndon't have to do too much to this, and\n\n276\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.890\na lot of times they don't.\n\n277\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.330\nBut you as a technician, you might need to\nsee different hidden folders and files.\n\n278\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.960\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n279\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.040\nLet me go ahead and I'm gonna close\nthis down, and what I'm gonna do\n\n280\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.580\nis I'll open file explorer one more time,\nand we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\n\n281\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.310\ndive down into local disk c and what\nwe're gonna look at is the user profile.\n\n282\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.450\nAnd I'm gonna go to local users, or\nexcuse me I'm sorry, local disk c, I'm\n\n283\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.610\ngonna go to users and remember these are\nwhere all your user profiles are stored.\n\n284\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.350\nAnd I'm gonna get into, in this case,\n\n285\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.930\nadmin, which is one of the user\nprofiles on this machine.\n\n286\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.940\nNow, notice something, and I want you to\npay attention right here around Contacts.\n\n287\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.550\nNotice that all of these folders, they're\nvery, very dark, but there is times when\n\n288\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.450\nyou wanna clear temp files out and\nyou wanna do it manually yourself.\n\n289\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.200\nWell where do you do that?\n\n290\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.170\nAccording to the default view,\n\n291\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.310\nyou can't see this hidden folder\nthat;s here that's called AppData.\n\n292\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.690\nSo what I would have to do, and\nagain this is specific to Windows 8.1.\n\n293\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:02.550\nI go to Folder Options and I could Change\nfolder in Search options on the ribbon.\n\n294\n00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:08.777\nAnd I could choose view, and notice\nthat I choose show hidden folders and\n\n295\n00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:14.812\nfiles right, And I could click this,\nand then apply it or say OK to it.\n\n296\n00:15:14.812 --> 00:15:16.883\nIf you say OK it closes\nthe dialog box down.\n\n297\n00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:19.664\nIf you click apply,\nit still does that same thing but\n\n298\n00:15:19.664 --> 00:15:21.800\nleaves the dialogue box open.\n\n299\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.430\nAnd if I go back up here,\nI can see app data right.\n\n300\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.720\nNow, I can drill down into app data,\nlocal, and then I can see all the various\n\n301\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.520\ntemp files here and I can potentially\nclear them out if I want to.\n\n302\n00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.310\nAlright, now if, In Windows 7 if we do\nthis it isn't really too much different.\n\n303\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.170\nThe only difference is here is,\n\n304\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.900\nthat we have the organized button\nover in Windows Explorers.\n\n305\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.610\nSame thing with Vista, as well.\n\n306\n00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.610\nI have folder and search options.\n\n307\n00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.548\nI have the view tab.\n\n308\n00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:53.860\nNotice by default show hidden files and\nfolders isn't selected,\n\n309\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.788\nselect the radio button choose apply and\nthen I could do the same thing I could\n\n310\n00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:02.680\ncome in here to computer,\nlocal disk C, users.\n\n311\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.237\nAdmin.\n\n312\n00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:07.240\nSure enough, there is that hidden file or\nhidden folder app data.\n\n313\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.330\nGo into local and then temp as well.\n\n314\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.010\nBut one of the things\nthat the ribbon bar does.\n\n315\n00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.320\nIn Windows 8.1, I kinda like is\nthe fact that when you choose view,\n\n316\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.650\nI want you to notice something right here.\n\n317\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.220\nAll right if I choose options,\noops let me get back to view.\n\n318\n00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.393\nI don't need to change the options,\n\n319\n00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:29.486\nnotice hidden items right\nhere right on the ribbon?\n\n320\n00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:33.425\nI can do that right here without\nopening up folder options.\n\n321\n00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:35.950\nAnd that's kinda cool to have that.\n\n322\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:42.320\nNow the other one that I also want you\nto know is hiding file extensions.\n\n323\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.690\nNotice it says file name and\nextensions right here on the ribbon.\n\n324\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.790\nSo I could do this in 8.1\nright from the ribbon.\n\n325\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.572\nBut I also want you to know as a control\npanel utility that if I choose again our\n\n326\n00:16:52.572 --> 00:16:56.832\nfolder options dialog box that I can\ndo this from that same View tab,\n\n327\n00:16:56.832 --> 00:16:58.138\nI can go to View tab.\n\n328\n00:16:58.138 --> 00:17:00.698\nAnd if I scroll down just a little bit,\n\n329\n00:17:00.698 --> 00:17:05.590\nyou'll see that we have hide\nextensions for known file types, right?\n\n330\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.050\nAnd I could uncheck this.\n\n331\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.080\nIt would be the same thing\nin Windows 7 and Vista.\n\n332\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.120\nAnd I could choose apply.\n\n333\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.170\nAnd now when I come back, now I see,\nwhat are the different file extensions?\n\n334\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.990\nAnd that might be important for\nyou on the exam.\n\n335\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.350\nSo that's some of the things\nthat you can do there.\n\n336\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.290\nYou also have things like your\ngeneral options and here,\n\n337\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.500\nI'll switch back to Windows 7 here,\n\n338\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.810\nkinda all over the place just to show you\nthe different kind of views that you have.\n\n339\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.870\nWe got our general options\nwhere you could do again,\n\n340\n00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.680\nsingle click versus double click.\n\n341\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.510\nAgain, do you wanna see all folders and\nwhat that would\n\n342\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.130\ndo is that would modify the hierarchical\nview here on the other side.\n\n343\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.360\nSearch functionality again, how to search\nand different options that you can do.\n\n344\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.005\nNon index locations and what to search.\n\n345\n00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:52.920\nSo we can also modify those.\n\n346\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.080\nNow, if you have somebody that goes in\nhere and they make all different kinds of\n\n347\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.080\nclicks and you wanna restore the defaults,\nyou can just click this button right here.\n\n348\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.380\nYou can choose, apply.\n\n349\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.622\nAnd then you'll notice if we go back\nto the View tab, keep in mind that,\n\n350\n00:18:06.622 --> 00:18:12.058\nit'll reset essentially a lot of the\nsettings that could get messed up in here.\n\n351\n00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:14.330\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about your folder options,\n\n352\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.660\nwe do have some other things that we\nwanna look at in the control panel.\n\n353\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.366\nI'm gonna go ahead and switch over here,\nwe're gonna kinda stay in Windows 8.1 for\n\n354\n00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:24.158\na little bit because we've been\ndealing with Window 7 as well and\n\n355\n00:18:24.158 --> 00:18:26.270\nwe want to kind of give\nyou options essentially.\n\n356\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.240\nMaybe not folder options.\n\n357\n00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.860\nWe just gave you that but\nadditional options right?\n\n358\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.612\nSo I'll go to control panel.\n\n359\n00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:34.753\nNow what we're going to be doing is\nwe're going to be looking at system.\n\n360\n00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:36.610\nNow system is important.\n\n361\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.190\nWe've kind of looked at it in other\nways where we've right clicked on\n\n362\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.030\nthe Windows Charm here.\n\n363\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.248\nAnd we've chose system here\nfrom this menu as well.\n\n364\n00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:49.677\nYou could also I guess I will show\nyou Windows 7 cuz you can also get to\n\n365\n00:18:49.677 --> 00:18:51.869\nhere choosing the start button.\n\n366\n00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:56.710\nRight clicking right clicking let's\ntry to right click there Wes.\n\n367\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.190\nWe can right click and\nwe can also choose properties.\n\n368\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.760\nAnd it's gonna get us\nto the same location.\n\n369\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.530\nNotice it's Control Panel,\nSystem and Security, and System.\n\n370\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.800\nSo, I just wanted to show you a few\ndifferent ways that you can get to it.\n\n371\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.070\nSo looking at System,\none of the things that I'm really,\n\n372\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:16.120\nreally, worried about here on\nthe exam are, Performance Settings\n\n373\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.770\nas well as remote settings and\nthen things like system protection.\n\n374\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.475\nAnd the great thing is you have these\ndifferent task links that allow you to\n\n375\n00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:25.744\nget to these locations.\n\n376\n00:19:25.744 --> 00:19:28.047\nRight so for instance,\nif I choose remote settings.\n\n377\n00:19:28.047 --> 00:19:30.470\nThis just brings up\nyour system properties.\n\n378\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.219\nAnd It really just starts you out\non different tabbed locations.\n\n379\n00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:35.470\nNotice this is remote but guess what?\n\n380\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.690\nNotice there's system\nprotection right next to it.\n\n381\n00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.979\nWell you could probably only imagine where\nthis hyperlink's gonna take you right?\n\n382\n00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:44.096\nSystem protection takes you\nto system protection tab.\n\n383\n00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:48.014\nAll right and then finally\nadvanced system settings right?\n\n384\n00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:50.490\nIt takes you to the advanced option right?\n\n385\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.675\nSo system protection, this is where we\ncould turn on system protection as well as\n\n386\n00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:58.429\nmanipulate and utilize the system\nrestore functionality that we talked\n\n387\n00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:00.844\nabout pretty extensively\nin other episodes.\n\n388\n00:20:00.844 --> 00:20:02.850\nSo we're not gonna go\ninto it too much here.\n\n389\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.760\nBasically restoring your configuration of\nyou operating system to an earlier point\n\n390\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.240\nin time through something know as\na restore point, remote, right.\n\n391\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.480\nThis is where we can\nturn on remote desktop,\n\n392\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.720\nunderstand remote desktop allows me\nto connect back this machine and\n\n393\n00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.840\ncontrol the desktop as though I was,\nsitting locally, logged into the machine.\n\n394\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.184\nVery good in those situations like Dan\nwas saying, where maybe you do have that\n\n395\n00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:28.032\noption, where you don't have to\nwalk a user through everything.\n\n396\n00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:31.434\nYou can actually connect to their machine,\ntake control over the desktop, and\n\n397\n00:20:31.434 --> 00:20:35.360\nyou can make the modifications and\nthen disconnect, and they can log back in.\n\n398\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.540\nHowever, there might be certain scenarios\nwhere you want to actually show them.\n\n399\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.900\nMaybe you've tried to go\nthrough the step by steps.\n\n400\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.940\nAnd somebody just doesn't really\nknow where to click around.\n\n401\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.900\nWell Remote Assistance, which is on\nby default unlike Remote Desktop,\n\n402\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.520\ndisabled by default, zam alert, allows\nsomebody to connect to this machine.\n\n403\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.860\nAnd actually view at the same\ntime what's going on.\n\n404\n00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.140\nSo that's important.\n\n405\n00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.170\nWe can share control over the desktop.\n\n406\n00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.310\nAnd Dan essentially could if he wanted to,\nhe could see what they're seeing.\n\n407\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.960\nThey could see what he's seeing and\n\n408\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.755\nessentially they could share the control\nof the desktop in which it would allow Dan\n\n409\n00:21:13.755 --> 00:21:17.960\nto walk through the process of whatever it\nmight be that he needs to fix or myself.\n\n410\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.930\nAnd then the end user can also\nsee it as well, all right?\n\n411\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.930\nOne of the next things I wanna talk about\nis on that advanced tab that we have\n\n412\n00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.780\nback here.\n\n413\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.080\nNotice there is the performance option.\n\n414\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.680\nPerformance option is important\nbecause this is where\n\n415\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.960\nyou can set different visual effects,\nif you will.\n\n416\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.980\nAgain, keep in mind it depends\non what your CPU utilization is.\n\n417\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.550\nIf you are adjusting for best performance\nit's gonna strip some of these down and\n\n418\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.640\ntry to save you processing power.\n\n419\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.589\nAdjust for best appearance means that\nyou have the resources within your\n\n420\n00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:52.871\nmachines to give you the best graphical\nuser interface experience possible.\n\n421\n00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.916\nAdvanced, this is where you do,\nyou could see processor scheduling.\n\n422\n00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:59.210\nI think, processor scheduling is a little\nbit beyond the scope of this exam but\n\n423\n00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.630\npage file, right?\n\n424\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.880\nWe talk about virtual memory.\n\n425\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.254\nKeep in mind that virtual memory,\nessentially,\n\n426\n00:22:04.254 --> 00:22:07.770\nis a way that you have something known\nas a VMM, a Virtual Memory Manager.\n\n427\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.891\nAnd what the Virtual Memory Manager\ndoes is it allows you to take data\n\n428\n00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:15.363\nthat isn't currently being\nused in your physical RAM and\n\n429\n00:22:15.363 --> 00:22:18.640\nthen basically page it or\nwrite it to the hard drive.\n\n430\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.792\nAnd the Virtual Memory Manager\ncould swap information in and\n\n431\n00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:24.569\nout of the hard drive and\nRAM and this is really good for\n\n432\n00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:28.867\nsystems that in the earlier days had\nlimited amounts of physical memory, right?\n\n433\n00:22:28.867 --> 00:22:32.305\nAgain, remember memory,\nit is a temporary workbench.\n\n434\n00:22:32.305 --> 00:22:34.995\nThe more of it I have, the more I\ncan be working with it one time.\n\n435\n00:22:34.995 --> 00:22:37.105\nHowever, as it starts to get full,\n\n436\n00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:40.635\napplications might call on a location\nin memory and don't have it.\n\n437\n00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:44.355\nThe virtual memory manager could then\ntake that information out of RAM\n\n438\n00:22:44.355 --> 00:22:46.760\nthat isn't currently being utilized.\n\n439\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.360\nAnd page it right to the hard drive and\nthen allow an application to continue\n\n440\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.220\nto consume memory and be able to work\nrather than the application freezing,\n\n441\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.980\nhanging up or\nnot being able to work at all.\n\n442\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.580\nAnd it's transparent to the application.\n\n443\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.350\nThat's why they call it a page or\na swap file cuz it's swapping data in and\n\n444\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.280\noff the hard drive.\n\n445\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.030\nNow Microsoft recommends that whatever\nyour physical RAM is, so let's say 2 gigs,\n\n446\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:16.180\nthat your paging file be set to 1.5 times\nwhatever the physical RAM is installed.\n\n447\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.975\nSo if you have 2 gigs of RAM,\nwell, guess what?\n\n448\n00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:21.366\n1 times 2, right, is 2.\n\n449\n00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:22.870\nAnd then another 1.5,\n\n450\n00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.810\nessentially what you're gonna\nhave is 3 gig, a 3 gig page file.\n\n451\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:31.560\nHowever, a lot of times it's better\nto just let Windows Manage this and\n\n452\n00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.670\nthis is where we can do that.\n\n453\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.680\nAutomatically manage the page file for\nall drives.\n\n454\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.760\nIf we didn't want to do this,\n\n455\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.940\nwe could always do a manual configuration\nhere on each individual drive.\n\n456\n00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.820\nBut we're not gonna do that right now.\n\n457\n00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.280\nBecause the and\n\n458\n00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.650\nI'm not even though it looks like I made\nchanges I didn't make changes to it.\n\n459\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.590\nSo keep in mind that if you\ndo make changes to that\n\n460\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.540\nit requires a restart to\nthe operating system.\n\n461\n00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.495\nOne of the things that they do talk about\nis sometimes you can optimize performance\n\n462\n00:23:57.495 --> 00:24:01.009\nbecause remember your hard drive is\nconstantly doing reads and writes.\n\n463\n00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:04.881\nOr your operating system is constantly\ndoing reads and writes with a paging file.\n\n464\n00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:07.622\nWell if you take that paging file and\nyou move it to a separate drive.\n\n465\n00:24:07.622 --> 00:24:10.322\nThen the operating system and\nall the applications that\n\n466\n00:24:10.322 --> 00:24:14.770\nare using the existing hard drive don't\nhave contention with the paging file.\n\n467\n00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.240\nSo that's called page file optimization.\n\n468\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.630\nAgain with systems today having so\n\n469\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.220\nmuch memory in them it's not that we\ndon't necessarily use the paging files.\n\n470\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.890\nCertain applications are still\ngeared to look for it,\n\n471\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:32.360\nhowever it's not really much of an issue\ntoday as it was in earlier days.\n\n472\n00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.900\nAll right, a couple of the last things\nI kind of want to round off here,\n\n473\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.810\nthey talk about control panel utilities.\n\n474\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.290\nI do want to mention, just briefly, in\nthe control panel if you go to System and\n\n475\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.080\nSecurity.\n\n476\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.630\nSystem and Maintenance if you're\ninside of Windows Vista, System and\n\n477\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.220\nSecurity in Windows 7 and\nWindows 8.1 is the Windows firewall.\n\n478\n00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.880\nWe've kind of already talked about\nthe Windows firewall in other episodes,\n\n479\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.350\nwhere we talked about the features.\n\n480\n00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.560\nWe really did talk about this a lot, but\n\n481\n00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.550\nI do wanna mention it as\na control panel utility.\n\n482\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.920\nKeep in mind,\nthat it is what allows you to, or\n\n483\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:12.830\nan application to communicate inbound\nform the network to your system.\n\n484\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.480\nBy default, as a recap,\n\n485\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.825\nremember that the Windows firewall blocks\nall traffic coming into your system.\n\n486\n00:25:18.825 --> 00:25:22.970\nUnless you allow that application to\ncommunicate through the firewall,\n\n487\n00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.330\nit's called creating an exception.\n\n488\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.320\nBy default,\nall outbound traffic is allowed, and\n\n489\n00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.580\nagain, you can see some of\nthe things that you can do here.\n\n490\n00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.620\nChanging the intrusive nature of\nthe notification settings, I don't like\n\n491\n00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.280\nto do this, I like to be aware when\nthings are attacking my computer.\n\n492\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.870\nBecause if I turn off the notifications,\n\n493\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.110\nI don't really know that\nsomething's happening.\n\n494\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.530\nAnd then this isn't really recommended,\nbut you could turn off or\n\n495\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.426\non the firewall, or turn it on or\noff, we'll try better English.\n\n496\n00:25:50.426 --> 00:25:53.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If things get hosed up a little\n\n497\n00:25:53.108 --> 00:25:57.350\nbit too much you can always restore\nthem to the original defaults.\n\n498\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.530\nAnd then if you're a little bit more tech\nsavvy you can always use the Windows\n\n499\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.050\nfirewall with advanced settings.\n\n500\n00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:08.580\nAll right, last thing on the list that\nwe wanna talk about, just briefly,\n\n501\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.660\nis what are known as Power Options or\nPower Plans as they're called today.\n\n502\n00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.870\nLet's go ahead and\ngo to System and Security, and\n\n503\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.650\nyou will see Power Options here.\n\n504\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.680\nNow, if we get into Power Options,\n\n505\n00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.190\nI want you to keep in mind that there\nare a few different plans here.\n\n506\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.820\nThere are three different plans,\nnow, you might say, well Wes,\n\n507\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.530\nI only see two of them on the screen.\n\n508\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.550\nWell, that's because if I choose\nthis little drop-down arrow,\n\n509\n00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.310\nyou'll see that there is another\none in here, High performance.\n\n510\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.360\nBut, by default, they kinda hide it,\nespecially if you're on a laptop.\n\n511\n00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.350\nLet's talk about these\ndifferent power plans.\n\n512\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.080\nIn the earlier days, and\neven in command prompt today,\n\n513\n00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.710\nthey're still called power schemes.\n\n514\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:55.060\nIn fact, there is a command prompt command\n\n515\n00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.090\nthat I want you to be aware of that's\nassociated with power options.\n\n516\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.070\nAnd it's called powercfg.exe, and\n\n517\n00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.670\nthis allows you the ability to\nmodify this from command prompt.\n\n518\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:12.070\nI don't really think they're gonna get\ntoo much in-depth because there is a lot\n\n519\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.780\nof stuff that you have to be aware of.\n\n520\n00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.560\nAnd let me see if I can remember\nit real quick, powercfg\n\n521\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.329\nI think it's list, yeah, and you can see\nthings you have to know GUIDs, right?\n\n522\n00:27:24.329 --> 00:27:26.930\nYou could see the power\nplans inside of here, and\n\n523\n00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.560\nI can see with the asterisk symbol, kind\nof like what we talked about with disk\n\n524\n00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.280\nmanagement, that this is the one\nthat's currently selected.\n\n525\n00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.610\nSo I just bring that up there as a little\ntidbit in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n526\n00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.940\nNow going back to power plans,\nagain this defines how power is treated or\n\n527\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.510\nhow you're operating system\nwill treat the hardware.\n\n528\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:51.345\nIf you're on battery power versus if\nyou are plugged into the AC outlets or\n\n529\n00:27:51.345 --> 00:27:53.795\nthe power adapter, if you will.\n\n530\n00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:57.375\nYou can do things like\nrequiring a password on wakeup,\n\n531\n00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.905\nyou can choose what the power\nbutton does on the machine,\n\n532\n00:27:59.905 --> 00:28:03.072\nyou can see I can even create\npower plans if I want.\n\n533\n00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:06.802\nWhen it comes to these three different\npower plans, balanced is one that,\n\n534\n00:28:06.802 --> 00:28:09.832\nlike you can see, and you guys can\nprobably pause it and sit there and\n\n535\n00:28:09.832 --> 00:28:11.182\nread or read along with me.\n\n536\n00:28:11.182 --> 00:28:16.032\nNotice it says automatically balances\nperformance with energy consumption\n\n537\n00:28:16.032 --> 00:28:18.032\non capable hardware.\n\n538\n00:28:18.032 --> 00:28:18.867\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n539\n00:28:18.867 --> 00:28:24.870\n[LAUGH] All right, what it means is\nthat if you need CPU power, it's\n\n540\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.650\ngonna ramp up the CPU, it's gonna give\nyou the processing power that you need.\n\n541\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.570\nWhen you're not using CPU intensive\napplications, it throttles it,\n\n542\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.040\nit slows it down, all right?\n\n543\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.170\nThat's why they call it balanced,\n\n544\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.080\nif you need the processing power,\nyou're gonna get it.\n\n545\n00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.780\nIf you're not utilizing hardware and\n\n546\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.180\nCPU utilization,\nyou're gonna reduce the voltage or\n\n547\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.650\nit will reduce the voltage to the system\ntrying to prolong the battery life.\n\n548\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.200\nPower saver, notice it says,\n\n549\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.640\nsaves energy by reducing your\ncomputer's performance where possible.\n\n550\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.610\nWhat does this mean?\n\n551\n00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.470\nWell this means it's gonna throttle\nthe CPU whether you need the power or not.\n\n552\n00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.680\nSo be careful on this one, because it does\nreduce your performance just like it says.\n\n553\n00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.860\nIt means that we're gonna throttle the CPU\nand it doesn't matter if you launch\n\n554\n00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.170\nan application that requires\nthat processing power.\n\n555\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:12.365\nThat's why they say it could\naffect affect performance, right?\n\n556\n00:29:12.365 --> 00:29:15.265\nHigh performance says we don't\ncare about conserving anything,\n\n557\n00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:18.425\nwe're gonna run it wide open right\nuntil your battery just fails.\n\n558\n00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:24.405\nNot fails, but [LAUGH] runs out of juice,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n559\n00:29:24.405 --> 00:29:28.305\nLast thing I wanna mention here is\nthat there are a couple different low\n\n560\n00:29:28.305 --> 00:29:30.285\npower modes that you have to be aware of.\n\n561\n00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:33.520\nThere is what is known as sleep or\nsuspend,\n\n562\n00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.270\nI've heard it called quite\na few different things, right?\n\n563\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:42.270\nSleep, suspend, standby if you will, and\nit's just different classifications and\n\n564\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.510\nas it's gone through the Windows versions\nit's called something different, right?\n\n565\n00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.020\nWe'll call it sleep,\nthe other one is hibernate, okay?\n\n566\n00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.820\nSo what is the difference\nbetween these two?\n\n567\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.720\nWell, sleep, what it does is it shuts down\nall power, goes into a low powered mode\n\n568\n00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.990\nby shutting down all of your devices,\nwith the exception of RAM.\n\n569\n00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.290\nIt keeps an electrical current still\nrefreshing the information that's inside\n\n570\n00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.550\nof your random access memory,\nmeaning it's retaining your data.\n\n571\n00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:15.030\nHere's the problem, while that's good and\nit does conserve your battery life, it\n\n572\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:20.452\nmeans if that battery finally loses power,\nyou lose power to your RAM, guess what?\n\n573\n00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:22.820\nYou can also lose your data, so\nyou've got to be careful, right?\n\n574\n00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.120\nIt does prolong the battery life, but\n\n575\n00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.620\nyou do have a potential\nto lose your information.\n\n576\n00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.480\nHibernate, what's difference between that?\n\n577\n00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.180\nWell hibernate does something\na little bit different,\n\n578\n00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.830\nit powers everything\ndown including your RAM.\n\n579\n00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.950\nBut not before it takes\nthe entire contents of RAM and\n\n580\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.020\nwrites it to the hard drive.\n\n581\n00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.280\nThat's called a hiberfil.sys file,\n\n582\n00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.160\nby the way, so\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n583\n00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.450\nI remembered it as the hibernation file,\nhiber, H-I-B-E-R-F-I-L.S-Y-S, right?\n\n584\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.360\nIt's basically all\nthe contents of your RAM, and\n\n585\n00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.330\nwhat's interesting is when your computer\ngoes through a normal boot process.\n\n586\n00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.050\nThe Windows boot manager says, before it\neven looks at the kernel file that's on\n\n587\n00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.910\nthe hard drive, it says wait,\ndo I find the hyperfill.sys file?\n\n588\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.140\nOkay, I see there's something there,\n\n589\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.460\nthat means there's hibernation\nstate data in there.\n\n590\n00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.490\nIn fact, I'm not even gonna mess\nwith a normal kernel file and\n\n591\n00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.540\ndo a normal bootstrap.\n\n592\n00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.830\nI'll just pull that file and dump it back\ninto RAM, and then you resume from there.\n\n593\n00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.770\nSo the benefit is you get\nthe power saving that you need\n\n594\n00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.610\nto prolong your battery life, but at\nthe same time, you don't lose your data.\n\n595\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.440\nSo, why would you use one over the other?\n\n596\n00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.480\nWell, it really just comes down to how\nfast do you wanna resume from a low\n\n597\n00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.200\npowered state, all right?\n\n598\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.980\nYou don't go to the full boot process that\nyou would in a hibernation state, but\n\n599\n00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.600\nfastest resume is coming\nback from the sleep mode.\n\n600\n00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.210\nNow Windows and most of the operating\nsystems have some kind of hybrid method.\n\n601\n00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:54.890\nThey actually have, what is it, fast\nreboot or fast standby, I believe it is.\n\n602\n00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.418\nIt's a hybrid and what this actually\ndoes is it does the same thing with\n\n603\n00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:03.870\na hyberfil.sys file, but\nit also does it in a sleep mode.\n\n604\n00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.010\nSo what it does is it goes into sleep and\nit keeps your RAM refreshed,\n\n605\n00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.270\nbut right before it did that it\nwrote everything to the hard drive.\n\n606\n00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.880\nSo you kind of get the best of both,\nif you lose power,\n\n607\n00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.740\nyou still have the hiberfil file,\nso that's actually kind of cool.\n\n608\n00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.640\nI think it's called fast standby\nis what it's called, but\n\n609\n00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.180\nit's not something that's\njust unique to Windows.\n\n610\n00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.610\nLinux has been doing this for awhile,\n\n611\n00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.570\nI think Windows just\nrecently jumped on board.\n\n612\n00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.510\nIt's why we have ultra fast\nreboot times today and\n\n613\n00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.930\nit's sometimes coupled with solid state.\n\n614\n00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:40.520\nYour systems basically will reboot or\nresume so fast today.\n\n615\n00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.790\nSo those are a few of the things to\nkeep in mind when it comes to your\n\n616\n00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.640\npower options.\n\n617\n00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.930\nBe aware of the different types,\n\n618\n00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.200\nalso be aware of some of\nthe files that we've said and\n\n619\n00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.800\nall the different paths when it comes to\ngetting to these control panel utilities.\n\n620\n00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.240\nBecause I can tell you,\nthe one way you like to get to them\n\n621\n00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.680\nprobably won't be the way\nthey ask you on the exam, and\n\n622\n00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.550\nit can save you not only a lot of time and\neffort in your help desk experience.\n\n623\n00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.250\nBut it also can help you to pass that exam\nby getting some of these easy softball\n\n624\n00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.330\npitch questions right just by knowing the\ndifferent paths to get to these utilities.\n\n625\n00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, a lot of great\nutilities found inside of the control\n\n626\n00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.790\npanel in a Windows operating system.\n\n627\n00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.400\nSo as he's been alluding to get familiar\nwith them, get comfortable with working\n\n628\n00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.350\nwith them, and find those multiple\nways in which you can access them.\n\n629\n00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.840\nBecause like he said, you never know\nwhich one they're gonna throw at you and\n\n630\n00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.410\nit's usually the one\nthat's you're weakest.\n\n631\n00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.350\nI don't know how they know, but they know,\nthey're smart people over at COMPTIA.\n\n632\n00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.130\nAll right Wes, thanks for\njoining us today, and\n\n633\n00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.660\nwe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n634\n00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.300\nBut, looks like it is that time ladies and\ngents for us to sign off.\n\n635\n00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.900\nFor ITPRO.TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n636\n00:33:40.900 -->

00:00:08.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.246\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.130\nWelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.820\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, well you know it, we're back with\n\n8\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.260\nmore in our A+ series because it's\nthe song that never ends, all right.\n\n9\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.160\nIt's a lot of information for\nus to go through.\n\n10\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.550\nThat's why this is one of our most popular\nand most lengthy shows that we do.\n\n11\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.910\nAnd joining us in the studio to help\ntrudge along right there next to us,\n\n12\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.030\nholding our wee little\nhands cuz we're scared and\n\n13\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.405\nalone in the woods,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.275\nWes, we're glad to have you man,\nhow's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.155\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm so scared.\n\n16\n00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:46.282\nIt's almost like the Blair Witch Project\nhere, right That's right,\n\n17\n00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:50.969\nwe are continuing along inside of A+ and,\nwell like Ann says, we are in 902.\n\n18\n00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.289\nSo were looking at the the software, and\n\n19\n00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.863\nin the 901 you know we really talked\nabout the hardware side of networking and\n\n20\n00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.700\nreal briefly did we actually get\ninto Windows client networking.\n\n21\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.630\nSo we're actually going to look\nthrough essentially some of\n\n22\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.720\nthe objectives that they\nwant us to talk about here.\n\n23\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.670\nAnd this is formally,\n\n24\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.770\nif you're following along with\nthe objectives out there this is 1.6.\n\n25\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240\nGiven a scenario install and configure\nWindows networking on a client desktop.\n\n26\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.270\nSo let's go ahead and do exactly that.\n\n27\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.120\nNow one of the very first things\nthat they call out in our objectives\n\n28\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.000\nare what is known as a domain setup.\n\n29\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.040\nNow we, in a past episode,\n\n30\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.940\nwe briefly talked about a work\ngroup versus a domain, all right.\n\n31\n00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.150\nSo I want to go ahead and\nkind of touch base on that because that is\n\n32\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.140\nreally something you need to be aware of\nwhen it comes to networking really just\n\n33\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.990\nany computer,\nlet alone if it's a Windows computer.\n\n34\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.898\nSo what's a work group?\n\n35\n00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:48.420\nA work group is Microsoft's implementation\nof what's known as a peer to peer network.\n\n36\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.560\nWhen we talk about peer to peer networks,\n\n37\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.710\nwe want you to understand\nthat their called peers.\n\n38\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750\nThe client, the computers, the operating\nsystems are called peers because\n\n39\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.070\nthey could be requesting\nresources from other peers,\n\n40\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.970\nor they could also be providing\nservices to those other peers.\n\n41\n00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.110\nSo for instance, if I have one Windows\nclient operating system that essentially\n\n42\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.800\nhas a printer connected to the machine,\nand it is shared out with the work group.\n\n43\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.850\nThen what's happening?\n\n44\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.360\nWell that client operating system is\nactually providing a service, if you will,\n\n45\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.040\nto the other operating systems or machines\nthat are joined to the work group.\n\n46\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.190\nAll right, essentially it's serving,\nif you will, a service.\n\n47\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.980\nThat's how we get the term server,\nright, it's providing a service.\n\n48\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.385\nAnd then the other operating systems\nwithin there could be requesting\n\n49\n00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:42.102\na resource and essentially requesting\naccess to the printer, all right.\n\n50\n00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:45.536\nSo understand that when we say peers,\nthey're equal in their\n\n51\n00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:49.896\nterms of requesting a resource, which\nis typically what we call a client, and\n\n52\n00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:53.812\nbasically providing that resource,\nwhich is a server.\n\n53\n00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:57.700\nAll right, now it's a decentralized model\nin the fact that every one of the machines\n\n54\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.052\nwithin a work group\nmaintains there own users.\n\n55\n00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:06.680\nAll right, so if I have client one,\ntwo, three, four, five, and I want\n\n56\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.290\nto have a user that is gonna be able to\naccess each one of those five computers.\n\n57\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.940\nThen what I have to do is I\nhave to go to client one,\n\n58\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.030\nand I have to create them,\ntheir user name, and assign a password.\n\n59\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.240\nBut that user name and password doesn't\nallow them to log on to the next machine.\n\n60\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.880\nSo if I want that constancy I\nhave to go to client two and\n\n61\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.480\nI have to create the same user name and\nthe same password so\n\n62\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.020\nthat they can now log\ninto the second machine.\n\n63\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.940\nBut keep in mind that each one\nof these machines maintains\n\n64\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.500\nthose user accounts completely separate.\n\n65\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.183\nAnd you keep doing that across\nyour various computers.\n\n66\n00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:44.515\nNow Microsoft really limits the amount of\ncomputers that can joined to a work group\n\n67\n00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.654\nto ten because when you start\ntalking about ten computers,\n\n68\n00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:50.240\nyou talk about a lot\nof accounts to manage.\n\n69\n00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.050\nAnd the fact that it's decentralized and\nthe fact that I have to go to every\n\n70\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.630\nindividual computer and\nmange those accounts.\n\n71\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.940\nIt starts to become\nan administrative nightmare.\n\n72\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.800\nRight, its the opposite of what we\ncall least amount of administrative\n\n73\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.580\neffort, right.\n\n74\n00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.480\nAs administrators we wanna be,\nwe wanna be lazy.\n\n75\n00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.564\nNot really but we do wanna reduce\nthe complexities of our job.\n\n76\n00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:10.753\nSo decentralized monos,\n\n77\n00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:13.840\nthe peer to peer groups also known\nas work groups are limited to ten.\n\n78\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.090\nAfter that Microsoft recommends moving\ninto what's known as a client server\n\n79\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.140\nmodel, and in the Windows world\nthat is what's known as a domain.\n\n80\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.060\nA domain is where you have\na centralized computer that manages\n\n81\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.360\nall of the user accounts,\nall of the resources within your network.\n\n82\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.130\nAnd essentially what you have are a series\nof client operating systems that\n\n83\n00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.510\nare managed by the centralized computer.\n\n84\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.440\nAll right, now that server,\nclient server model,\n\n85\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.660\nkeep in mind that what\nwe're saying here again.\n\n86\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.390\nAs a client is requesting a resource,\nit could be something like authentication.\n\n87\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.660\nI log into this client\noperating system and\n\n88\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.900\nthen it sends the credentials over the\nnetwork to that centralized server, again,\n\n89\n00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.600\nproviding the authentication service.\n\n90\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.910\nServing up the server.\n\n91\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.310\nEssentially servers are identified\nby the role that they perform.\n\n92\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.458\nAnd inside of a Windows domain we have\nwhat's known as an Active Directory domain\n\n93\n00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:03.490\ncontroller.\n\n94\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.300\nIt's called a domain controller for\na reason.\n\n95\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.930\nIt controls every aspect of the domain.\n\n96\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.890\nAll right, now the centralized model\nmeans that I can manage all of those\n\n97\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.190\nuser accounts in a single location.\n\n98\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.150\nNow when you first install your operating\nsystem by default you install it,\n\n99\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.810\nyour computer's a part of a work group.\n\n100\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.840\nIn fact let me show you what I mean.\n\n101\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.380\nWe got a Windows 7 machine here,\nand this Windows 7 machine,\n\n102\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.020\nif I was to push the Start button, right\nclick on Computer and choose Properties.\n\n103\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.125\nI would see that I have a machine that\nis joined to computer name, is Win7a.\n\n104\n00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.060\nAnd I can see that it's\njoined to a WORKGROUP.\n\n105\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.125\nHowever, you could have a machine\nthat is joined to the domain.\n\n106\n00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:46.430\nAnd when it's joined to the domain\nwhat it means is it becomes a member,\n\n107\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.740\njust like your user account does, that is\nnow controlled by that domain controller.\n\n108\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.320\nIn fact, if we do that same thing here, we\nright click on our Windows tile here and\n\n109\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.830\nchoose System.\n\n110\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.350\nYou will notice a little bit different\nthan what we had in the first one, right.\n\n111\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.540\nNow notice we have this computer name,\njust like we did in the first one.\n\n112\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.370\nIt was Win7a, right?\n\n113\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.570\nThis is Windows 81a.\n\n114\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.850\nThat's the computer name, but it also\nhas associated with it a domain name.\n\n115\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.130\nAll right, so\nthis is a domain setup, right.\n\n116\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.710\nWe have the host name, or\nthe computer name, plus its domain name.\n\n117\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.720\nThat becomes what's known as a full\ncomputer name in the MIcrosoft world,\n\n118\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.620\ncommonly called a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n119\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.550\nSo how do we get a computer\nattached to the domain?\n\n120\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.470\nLet's go ahead and show you that.\n\n121\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.400\nI'm going to switch back over\nto my Windows 7 machine, and\n\n122\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.310\nwe're in the System Control panel.\n\n123\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.060\nAnd we're gonna go to System Properties,\nall right.\n\n124\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.735\nAnd from system properties,\n\n125\n00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:41.890\nessentially what we're gonna do is\ngo to Advanced Settings, all right.\n\n126\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.520\nAnd we're gonna go to the computer name.\n\n127\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.440\nNow it is important to remember that\nyour computer needs a little bit of name\n\n128\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.040\nresolution.\n\n129\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.370\nSo it's gonna have to be able to find\nthe domain controller, all right.\n\n130\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.970\nSo let's go ahead and show you how to join\nthis computer to the domain, all right.\n\n131\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.500\nNotice that we have,\nif we want to rename the computer,\n\n132\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.450\nwe could always do that here.\n\n133\n00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.010\nI'm gonna leave the name the same, but\nit also says or change its domain or\n\n134\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.770\nworkgroup and we could choose change.\n\n135\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.170\nNow, this is the default when you\nfirst install your operating system.\n\n136\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.320\nNotice that it is part of a work group,\nand I could change the name.\n\n137\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.350\nAll right, but I'm not gonna do that.\n\n138\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.570\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna join a domain.\n\n139\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.710\nNow in order to join the domain,\nyou have to have administrative privileges\n\n140\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.040\ninside of the domain\nthat you want to join.\n\n141\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.510\nAll right, standard users,\n\n142\n00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.240\nyou gotta be careful here,\nyou can't do this, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.350\nNow there is an exception to the rule,\n\n144\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.060\nI believe standard users\nin Active Directory,\n\n145\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.820\nthey said that you could join up to ten\ncomputers to the domain by default.\n\n146\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.690\nAnd I think the 11th one you have to\nhave administrative privileges to do,\n\n147\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.200\nall right, but that could also be changed.\n\n148\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.760\nAnd that's why I said make sure you\nhave administrative privileges,\n\n149\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.380\nbecause your administrator\ncould say say no,\n\n150\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.760\nwe're not gonna let just anybody\njoin a computer on a domain.\n\n151\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.649\nRigtt, because well,\nthat would cause problems.\n\n152\n00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:57.008\nBut you do have to at least be a domain\nmember, at the very least, all right.\n\n153\n00:07:57.008 --> 00:07:58.634\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n154\n00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:03.445\nI might end up having to point The name\nresolution to the DNS server right?\n\n155\n00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:07.150\nIn another episode we talked about\nDNS right domain name system.\n\n156\n00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.370\nHas to be able to resolve this name.\n\n157\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.850\nAnd it might not happen if I\ndon't have the DNS server.\n\n158\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.690\nI'm pretty sure that I have the DNS server\nalready set up and DHCP is handing it out.\n\n159\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.850\nBut we might have to do\nthat on the fly here.\n\n160\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.800\nSo we'll go ahead and we will choose OK.\n\n161\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.450\nAnd notice that I get this\nauthentication prompt right away.\n\n162\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.430\nAnd it let's me know that hey,\nbased on the name that you typed in there,\n\n163\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.280\nyou have to put in the user\nname now remember,\n\n164\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.900\nthis is something known as\na down level authentication.\n\n165\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.230\nTechnically, because this isn't\nhappening on the local machine,\n\n166\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.050\nI'm not logging in to the local machine.\n\n167\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.450\nI'm sending this over the network\nto the domain controller,\n\n168\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.520\nthat centralized computer,\nand it has that database.\n\n169\n00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.981\nAlright now I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n170\n00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:56.940\nit's a good habit in when you're\nlogging in to the domain.\n\n171\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.840\nEspecially if you have a blank\nauthentication dialog box to put\n\n172\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.330\nthe domain name then a backslash after it.\n\n173\n00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.672\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna type administrator.\n\n174\n00:09:08.768 --> 00:09:13.850\nAnd I'll type my super\nsecret password here.\n\n175\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.080\nAll right, and then what we'll do\nis we will choose OK all right?\n\n176\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.679\nNow notice it tells me welcome\nto demo domain all right?\n\n177\n00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:28.677\nAnd this is essentially the domain\nthat you see in our Windows\n\n178\n00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:30.738\n8.1 machine join to.\n\n179\n00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:35.313\nNow here's the thing, understand that by\ndefault the user accounts are managed\n\n180\n00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:39.078\nat this point still on the local\nmachine but what we're saying is,\n\n181\n00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:43.651\nnow that I've joined this computer to\nthe domain, it's gonna say, all right,\n\n182\n00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.290\nI trust you server domain controller.\n\n183\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.330\nI form a trust relationship\nwith the domain and\n\n184\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.450\nI'm gonna send all of the credentials,\nright, user names and passwords\n\n185\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.950\nthat we type into this authentication\ndialogue box from here on out over to you.\n\n186\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.540\nAnd you tell me that they're okay and\nyou say they're fine, I'll trust you.\n\n187\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.380\nThat's why we call it a trust\nrelationship, that's domain set up.\n\n188\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.100\nThat's joining it to the domain.\n\n189\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.770\nBut that can't happen until we\nrestart the machine cause at\n\n190\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.070\nthis point nothing has changed.\n\n191\n00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.050\nSo you'll notice that\nwhen we choose OK it's\n\n192\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.190\ngonna say you gotta restart\nthe machine to apply the settings.\n\n193\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.730\nAnd we'll do exactly that.\n\n194\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.970\nWe'll let it go ahead\nby choosing close and\n\n195\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.650\nthen restart now we'll\nrestart this Windows 7 box.\n\n196\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.120\nNow understand that when it does\nthe restarting of this machine and\n\n197\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.830\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n198\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.820\nforce it to restart If we were to\njump over to our server, all right.\n\n199\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.320\nAnd let me go ahead and\nget logged in to our server,\n\n200\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.580\nwhat I should see is now I have a machine.\n\n201\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.860\nAnd I could find that within\nthe database now on my server.\n\n202\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.110\nNow, we don't have to worry about knowing\nanything about these databases or\n\n203\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.940\nanything at this point but I just wanna\nshow you that Active Directory essentially\n\n204\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.790\nis now this database where this computer's\nname is going to be stored and identify.\n\n205\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.530\nIt identifies that trust relationship and\nby default,\n\n206\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.530\nI should be able to come in here and\nfind now that WIN81A machine\n\n207\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.600\nhere or WIN7A,\njust like I can find the WIN81A machine.\n\n208\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.770\nAll right, now Dan, I believe you\nmentioned this in other episodes.\n\n209\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.320\nWe talk about being able to\ncontrol this machine now?\n\n210\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.110\nNow, as an administrator, we can say,\n\n211\n00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.590\nwe're gonna define what those settings\nare through things like root policy.\n\n212\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.410\nOne of the telltale signs that you've got\na machine that's joined to the domain is\n\n213\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.180\nnotice that I don't get that basic\nauthentication screen any more.\n\n214\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.880\nAll right, now what I have to\nis enter technically what they\n\n215\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.170\ncall a secure authentication sequence.\n\n216\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:40.022\nIt's the only thing that'll unlock\nthis machine is CTRL + ALT + DELETE.\n\n217\n00:11:40.022 --> 00:11:43.450\nNow, notice here, and I want you\nto be aware of this on the exam,\n\n218\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.350\nnotice that this says WIN7A\\ all right.\n\n219\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.420\nThis type of authentication is letting\nyou know where are you gonna log in.\n\n220\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.700\nIn this case if I type in the password\nhere I'm saying log in to the local\n\n221\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.930\nmachine where the local account\nis stored in the sam file.\n\n222\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.100\nI don't want that.\n\n223\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.790\nPart of the domain set up\nis to choose other use and\n\n224\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.410\nI'm gonna type demo backslash.\n\n225\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.380\nAnd notice it tells me hey\nyou're gonna log on to dem.\n\n226\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.480\nIn this case im gonna\ntype in administrator and\n\n227\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.190\nI'll type in the super secret password.\n\n228\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.500\nNow, what its gonna do is it's gonna\ncreate a completely new profile for me.\n\n229\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.350\nOne that didn't exist on this\nmachine before because it's\n\n230\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.750\ngotta have that special localized\nLocation of directories.\n\n231\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.380\nWell now,\n\n232\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.327\nwhoever is logging into this computer\ncan store their information, alright.\n\n233\n00:12:36.327 --> 00:12:40.650\nBut, the account is managed\nin that centralized location.\n\n234\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.120\nSo that's one of the very first parts\nwhen it comes to any kind windows client\n\n235\n00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.900\nnetworking.\n\n236\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.566\nYou're going to see this if you\nwork in any corporate environment,\n\n237\n00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:49.458\nwhere you have to join\na computer to the domain.\n\n238\n00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:54.007\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what Wes I used to\nbattle with my users left and right and\n\n239\n00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:57.230\nsay, login to the computer\nusing your account.\n\n240\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.180\nBecause now no matter what, cuz people\nwould say can I login to this computer?\n\n241\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.910\nI said, is it on our network,\nyeah, then you can login to it.\n\n242\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.480\nWell what do I use,\nwhat's the user name and password?\n\n243\n00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.620\nThe same user name and\npassword you log in with,\n\n244\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.570\nevery computer becomes that single point.\n\n245\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.880\nThat's how the network knows who you are,\nwhere you've logged in.\n\n246\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.290\nSo really you might have to drive\nthat point home as a technician.\n\n247\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.360\nSomeone might come up and\nsay can I log into this computer?\n\n248\n00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.370\nYes, what do I log in with, your Windows\nusername and password, whatever that is.\n\n249\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.510\nBecause it's unlikely.\n\n250\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.340\nThere might be a few of them\nfloating around depending on how\n\n251\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.358\nlarge the organization is.\n\n252\n00:13:34.358 --> 00:13:37.600\nThose work group joint computers, but\n\n253\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.750\nif everybody's on the domain,\nit's that regular user.\n\n254\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.320\nSame thing you log into\nyour email account,\n\n255\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.990\nif you're using Exchange with Outlook,\nright?\n\n256\n00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.980\nAnything that's Windows-centric.\n\n257\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.600\nIt now becomes that one-stop shopping,\nthat centralized management.\n\n258\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.820\nYou don't have to worry about remembering\na million passwords and usernames.\n\n259\n00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.930\nThat one that we give you when you\nbecome a user in our environment and\n\n260\n00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.020\nwhatever password you set,\n\n261\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.040\nyou can log into any computer as long\nas we haven't locked down rights.\n\n262\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.900\nServers and things like that,\nwe're not going to allow you to do that.\n\n263\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.870\nBut, it's really, really great.\n\n264\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.900\nAnd when it comes to joining the domain,\n\n265\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.730\nthat's a typical thing\nthat you'll do as a tech.\n\n266\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.330\nYou get new computers you have\nto join them to the domain so\n\n267\n00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.660\nthat they are trusted and a part of that.\n\n268\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.680\nBut you'll also join old\ncomputers to the domain.\n\n269\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.660\nYou'll have to break that trust.\n\n270\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.040\nBecause something may have gone\nhaywire with the connection and\n\n271\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.430\na lot of the times an easy fix is\nto un-join it from the domain and\n\n272\n00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.190\nthen rejoin it to the domain and\nthen everything starts working.\n\n273\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.100\nSo it's a really good skill to know\nhow to do like just rabble it off\n\n274\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.910\nthe top of your head.\n\n275\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.110\nIt's a great thing.\n\n276\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.620\n&gt;&gt; And we will get into showing that\nbecause you know sometimes people\n\n277\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.000\ndon't realize that authentication issues\ncould be exactly what Dan just said.\n\n278\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.060\nThat trust relationship you have\nto break the trust relationship.\n\n279\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.456\nWell sometimes it's broken for us,\n[LAUGH] when we didn't want to.\n\n280\n00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:53.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We didn't want ask it.\n\n281\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.538\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly and the domain controller\nsays I don't know who you are and\n\n282\n00:14:55.538 --> 00:14:57.380\nI'm certainly not going to\ntrust what you're handing me-\n\n283\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.274\n&gt;&gt; You're the devil.\n\n284\n00:14:58.274 --> 00:15:00.047\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah that's right and\n\n285\n00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:02.869\nthat's the good thing when we get into\nthings like authentication issues, when it\n\n286\n00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.630\ncomes to trouble shooting different\nportions of the operating system.\n\n287\n00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.430\nWe'll show you exactly that, and we'll\ntry to recreate some of these errors that\n\n288\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.470\nare gonna make you not only\nsuccessful on the exam.\n\n289\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.990\nThey're gonna save you a lot of headache\nwhen it comes to maybe the first time you\n\n290\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.210\nget into that help desk position.\n\n291\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.030\nNow the next thing that we have to talk\nabout is something known as network\n\n292\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.980\nshares, administrative shares,\nand mapping drives.\n\n293\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.720\nAll right, moving on, no just kidding.\n\n294\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.580\nWhat we have to do is,\nwhat is a network share?\n\n295\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.440\nAll right, what do we even mean when\nwe say network share, all right?\n\n296\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.940\nWell really, all it is is it's a folder\nthat's out there on a server somewhere,\n\n297\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.530\nand you can connect to\nit over the network.\n\n298\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.040\nAnd you can essentially store\nyour resources there all right?\n\n299\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.430\nAnd this is something\nthat's very important,\n\n300\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.050\nbecause I want you to keep in mind that in\na decentralized environment a lot of times\n\n301\n00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.880\nwhat you're gonna do, is you're gonna\nstore your files on the local hard drive.\n\n302\n00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.801\nRight in a very small office?\n\n303\n00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:55.791\nHowever, for\nan administrator that is a nightmare.\n\n304\n00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:57.687\nBecause what happens to hard drives?\n\n305\n00:15:57.687 --> 00:16:00.747\nIt's not a matter of if,\nit's a matter of when they fail.\n\n306\n00:16:00.747 --> 00:16:03.399\nAnd when you have user data that's very,\nvery important,\n\n307\n00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.949\nespecially if you're a company.\n\n308\n00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:07.590\nEspecially we talked about\nfinancial information.\n\n309\n00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:10.860\nNot even financial information,\nproductivity information and its loss\n\n310\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.280\ndue to a local hard drive failure, well,\nit can cost your company a lot of money.\n\n311\n00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.350\nSo one of the things that a lot of times\nthat we tell end users as administrators\n\n312\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.715\nas help desk is that save your information\nout there on that centralized location,\n\n313\n00:16:23.715 --> 00:16:25.345\nwhere everybody stores their information.\n\n314\n00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:28.713\nBecause then when I run preventative\nmaintenance and I'm running things like\n\n315\n00:16:28.713 --> 00:16:31.685\nbackups, I can back up all of your\ninformation in a single location.\n\n316\n00:16:31.685 --> 00:16:34.878\nRather than having to run the backup\nutilities on every single one of\n\n317\n00:16:34.878 --> 00:16:37.710\nthe hundreds of computers\nwithin your network.\n\n318\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.554\nSo we use what are known\nas network shares.\n\n319\n00:16:39.554 --> 00:16:41.535\nNow, I'm gonna show you\na network share coming up, but\n\n320\n00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:43.590\nthere are also administrative shares.\n\n321\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.583\nAnd administrative shares are ones\nthat are on your local machines.\n\n322\n00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:50.472\nAnd what they do is a lot of times,\nwell, first of all, they require\n\n323\n00:16:50.472 --> 00:16:55.275\nan administrator to gain access to them,\nhence the term, administrative share.\n\n324\n00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.760\nBut they use, a lot of times, for\nthings like troubleshooting and\n\n325\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.710\neven help desk as well, all right?\n\n326\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.550\nLet me show you where locally, you can\nsee those administrative shares, and\n\n327\n00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.650\nthen I'll show you network\nshares coming up, all right?\n\n328\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.730\nSo again, on our Windows 7 machine here,\nI'll tell you what,\n\n329\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.170\nwe'll move over to Windows 8.1 and\nkinda mix it up a little bit here.\n\n330\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.056\nAnd let me go ahead and if you guys\ndidn't know how to log in, at least now,\n\n331\n00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:16.620\nyou know how to log in.\n\n332\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.900\nYou log back into our machine, and\n\n333\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.700\nwe're gonna basically fire\nup computer management.\n\n334\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.020\nAnd I'm gonna right click on our Windows\ntile, choose Computer Management here.\n\n335\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.437\nAnd then you'll notice that\nin computer management,\n\n336\n00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:29.255\nthere's this Shared Folders, right?\n\n337\n00:17:29.255 --> 00:17:32.840\nAnd if we expand that out or\nwe can select it in the context pane,\n\n338\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.880\nit will show us what we're looking at,\nbut we'll select Shares, all right?\n\n339\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.140\nNow these are the administrative\nshares that you have\n\n340\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.480\nwithin your systems, all right?\n\n341\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.690\nNow, Users isn't an administrative share.\n\n342\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.750\nUsers is actually something\ncompletely different, so\n\n343\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.925\nI don't want you to worry about that one.\n\n344\n00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:50.840\nAdministrative shares are the ones that\nhave dollar signs after them, all right?\n\n345\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.055\nWell, the dollar sign basically\ndenotes it as being hidden.\n\n346\n00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:57.855\nAdministrative shares are ones that\nrequire administrative access to get to,\n\n347\n00:17:57.855 --> 00:17:58.430\nall right?\n\n348\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:04.820\nAnd every volume in which Windows is\ninstalled is an administrative share.\n\n349\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.350\nAnd you can connect to\nit over the network.\n\n350\n00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.220\nWe'll show you how to connect\nto shares here in a second.\n\n351\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.790\nBut that's an administrative share.\n\n352\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.109\nNow if you need to connect\nto the Windows directory in,\n\n353\n00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:18.670\nlet's say, over the network,\nyou can connect to it by typing in ADMIN$.\n\n354\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.192\nNow ADMIN$ is the share name,\n\n355\n00:18:21.192 --> 00:18:26.450\nit isn't the actual path to where\nthat share name's pointing.\n\n356\n00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.270\nIt's actually pointing to C:\\Windows.\n\n357\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.300\nAll right,\nnow you also have what's known as IPC.\n\n358\n00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.760\nIPC is not a soda, we're not talking\nabout IBC, we're talking about IPC.\n\n359\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.270\nThat's the interprocess communication.\n\n360\n00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.710\nThat is one that is used by two computers\nthat are sharing a network communication,\n\n361\n00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.470\nand they need a way to interact.\n\n362\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.010\nWe typically don't interact with this one,\nmore so as administrators more so\n\n363\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.270\nthan the operating systems.\n\n364\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.178\nThe network operating systems\ncommunicate behind the scenes, again,\n\n365\n00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:58.140\nwhen they're making\na network communication.\n\n366\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.739\nHowever, every drive is going to\nhave an administrative share, and\n\n367\n00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:03.487\nit's going to be a hidden share.\n\n368\n00:19:03.487 --> 00:19:05.522\nAnd it's usually hidden by default,\n\n369\n00:19:05.522 --> 00:19:09.280\nwell, it is hidden by default\nwith that dollar sign.\n\n370\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.330\nNow what do I mean when I say hidden,\nall right?\n\n371\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:18.280\nWell, let's show you how you would\nconnect to any network share,\n\n372\n00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.180\nfor that matter,\nlet alone if it's an administrative share.\n\n373\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.359\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwhat we'll do is,\n\n374\n00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:27.480\nwe'll bring up the traditional run line,\nright?\n\n375\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.522\nYou can also get to\nthe traditional run line if\n\n376\n00:19:32.522 --> 00:19:38.790\nyou want through the Windows key or\nkeyboard shortcut.\n\n377\n00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.770\nBut here's how you would get to it.\n\n378\n00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.050\nI'll also show you that you\ncan do this in file explorer.\n\n379\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.758\nYou do that through something known as\na universal naming convention, UNC,\n\n380\n00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:46.335\nall right?\n\n381\n00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:50.301\nThey call it universal naming convention\nbecause it isn't something that is just\n\n382\n00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:51.800\nspecific to Windows, right?\n\n383\n00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.942\nIf Dan's over there and\nhe's got a Linux box fired up,\n\n384\n00:19:54.942 --> 00:19:57.890\nhe's gonna use a UNC path\nto map to a network share.\n\n385\n00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.290\nIf we've got a Mac here, we're gonna\nmap to a network share, or not map,\n\n386\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.340\nwe're gonna connect to it.\n\n387\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.130\nWell, we'll talk about mapping coming up.\n\n388\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.610\nBut connect to that network share\nwith a universal naming convention.\n\n389\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.200\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n390\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:17.198\nAll right, so when you need to connect\nthe network share across the network,\n\n391\n00:20:17.198 --> 00:20:21.084\nyou type \\\\computername\\sharename.\n\n392\n00:20:21.084 --> 00:20:22.828\nNow I'm gonna get a little\nbit more specific.\n\n393\n00:20:22.828 --> 00:20:28.240\nThis is more generic than it is anything,\nbut I want you to know \\\\.\n\n394\n00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.620\nIt always starts with \\\\,\nit's the computer name.\n\n395\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.030\nThe one exception to that is the fact that\nit could be an IP address too because\n\n396\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.920\nit's TCP/IP communication over a network.\n\n397\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.010\nIt also responds to the IP\naddress of the computer.\n\n398\n00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.881\nBut I want you to know for\nthe test, computer name, backslash,\n\n399\n00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:45.330\nwhatever the share name is, all right?\n\n400\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.714\nNow remember, back here in the background,\n\n401\n00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:51.050\nwe have an example of\nan administrative share name.\n\n402\n00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.180\nAll right, when I said hidden,\nwhat do I mean?\n\n403\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:59.140\nWell, let me show you if I was to connect\nto an administrative share as well,\n\n404\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.040\nyou can do this in File Explorer too or\nWindows Explorer.\n\n405\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.330\nLet me show you, all right.\n\n406\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.750\nOop, backspace, not backslash.\n\n407\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.541\nAll right, if I do backslash backslash,\nand provided I have network discovery\n\n408\n00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:16.404\nturned on inside of the operating system,\nit's gonna show me some of the network\n\n409\n00:21:16.404 --> 00:21:19.711\ncomputers out there before\nI even finish the UNC path.\n\n410\n00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.120\nIn this case, you can see DC01,\n\n411\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.570\nthat's the domain controller\nthat we're talking about.\n\n412\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.090\nBut let me go a little\nbit farther than that and\n\n413\n00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.740\nshow you what I mean by computer name.\n\n414\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.175\nSo the DC's name is DC01.\n\n415\n00:21:29.175 --> 00:21:33.210\nWe do that a lot just so we can identify\nwhat the role is the server's providing.\n\n416\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.900\nAnd if I type backslash,\nnotice that right away,\n\n417\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.370\nit's letting me know that there's\nalready sharers out there.\n\n418\n00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.060\nAnd I didn't have to type a thing,\nall right?\n\n419\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.570\nNow what is the share name\nthat I wanna connect to?\n\n420\n00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.280\nWell, in this case, I've got one very\ngenerically called storage, right?\n\n421\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.630\nAnd if I connect to it,\nif I have the proper permissions,\n\n422\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.250\nI can create things like files in here,\nright?\n\n423\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.300\nAnd we store them.\n\n424\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.600\nThat's not on this local machine,\nthat's across the network, in this case,\n\n425\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.960\non the server.\n\n426\n00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.260\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Think of it like Dropbox or\n\n427\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.940\nGoogle Drive, but you're doing it\nyourself, it's not Google or Dropbox.\n\n428\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, the only difference is\nyou're not going out to the Internet.\n\n429\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.190\nYeah, that's a great analogy.\n\n430\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.020\nYou're just staying local, right?\n\n431\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.410\nAnd it's your computer across\nthe network that it's being stored on.\n\n432\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.200\nIt's a great analogy.\n\n433\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.240\nNow, notice that when I did the backslash\nhere, and let me kinda backspace this out,\n\n434\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.320\nit shows me some of these shares already.\n\n435\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.358\nRemember I said an administrative\nshare is a hidden share, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:31.358 --> 00:22:36.392\nc$, all right, so if I do c$,\nnotice that nothing came up.\n\n437\n00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:42.690\nBut if I hit Enter, because I'm\nan administrator, it is there, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.840\nSo there might be times where maybe\nDan calls me up and says hey Wes,\n\n439\n00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.070\nyou're in the local office.\n\n440\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.200\nI've tried to remotely connect.\n\n441\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.080\nI can't see what's going on on such and\nsuch computer.\n\n442\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.290\nCan you connect to the local hard drive\nand tell me if this driver's present?\n\n443\n00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.498\nMaybe on a network adapter and\n\n444\n00:22:57.498 --> 00:23:00.090\nthen maybe that's the reason\nhe can't get to it, right?\n\n445\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.320\nI just updated a driver, and\nit's giving me a hard time.\n\n446\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.975\nWell, I can connect over the network,\nin this case,\n\n447\n00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:07.990\nto the local hard drive of this machine.\n\n448\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.745\nAnd if I need to do some troubleshooting,\nI can go into things like Windows, right?\n\n449\n00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:14.580\nI can go into system 32.\n\n450\n00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.910\nI could go into drivers, right?\n\n451\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:22.160\nAnd I can find out hey,\nis that driver there, right, or is not?\n\n452\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.090\nI can also go to things\nlike the Windows directory.\n\n453\n00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:30.740\nNow notice that, again, if I do admin,\nand it isn't case sensitive by the way,\n\n454\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.500\neven though it's capitalized\ninside of computer management.\n\n455\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.410\nNotice that I can also type admin $\nsign and when I go there, that takes me,\n\n456\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:46.600\neven though the shared path is \\\\dco1,\nremember this for the exam.\n\n457\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.336\nI cannot stress this enough.\n\n458\n00:23:48.336 --> 00:23:52.833\nIt is share name, not folder name.\n\n459\n00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:54.128\nWhy do I say that?\n\n460\n00:23:54.128 --> 00:23:57.257\nI'm in the Windows folder\non the domain controller.\n\n461\n00:23:57.257 --> 00:24:01.184\nThat's not what it says in the UNC path,\nit says the share name.\n\n462\n00:24:01.184 --> 00:24:05.861\nAnd in this case, the administrative\nshare called admin$ is the share name.\n\n463\n00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:12.629\nHowever, the local path is c:\\window, so\nbe careful of that on the exam, all right?\n\n464\n00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:16.666\nIt is share name not folder name,\nall right?\n\n465\n00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:22.140\nIt just happens that I called\nthe folder that we went to originally,\n\n466\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.359\nI called it storage right?\n\n467\n00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:30.159\nI could have called it storage01 and\nthe folder could be called data, right?\n\n468\n00:24:30.159 --> 00:24:31.531\nSo don't get that confused.\n\n469\n00:24:31.531 --> 00:24:33.801\nAgain as a real quick recap.\n\n470\n00:24:35.819 --> 00:24:39.976\nIt is computername\\sharename, all right?\n\n471\n00:24:39.976 --> 00:24:41.952\nNow, that's a lot of work to do, right?\n\n472\n00:24:41.952 --> 00:24:46.480\nI mean, a lot of average end users, they\ndon't wanna have to type all this, right?\n\n473\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.571\nI don't wanna have to type that\nevery time I wanna go to share.\n\n474\n00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:50.763\nIf they can even do\nthat in a week anyways.\n\n475\n00:24:50.763 --> 00:24:52.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And again,\n\n476\n00:24:52.134 --> 00:24:55.647\nI'm not talking down to the average end\nuser who just wants to be available to use\n\n477\n00:24:55.647 --> 00:24:56.652\nthings like Outlook.\n\n478\n00:24:56.652 --> 00:24:59.172\nWants to be able to send emails,\nwants to be able draft a document,\n\n479\n00:24:59.172 --> 00:25:00.892\nthey don't wanna have\nto do all that typing.\n\n480\n00:25:00.892 --> 00:25:05.454\nSo the other thing that we can actually do\nis we can make it a little bit easier for\n\n481\n00:25:05.454 --> 00:25:09.065\nthem to get to locations by doing\nthings like mapping drives.\n\n482\n00:25:09.065 --> 00:25:12.498\nSo if I'm in Windows,\nlet's do this from Windows 8.1,\n\n483\n00:25:12.498 --> 00:25:15.940\nI know we're kinda running on\ntime on this first part here.\n\n484\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.385\nBut I can actually log in or\nlaunch up Windows Explorer or\n\n485\n00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:24.149\nFile Explorer in this case and I could\nchoose from the ribbon bar, Computer,\n\n486\n00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:26.443\nhere Map Network Drive, all right?\n\n487\n00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:31.025\nNow, provided I have the privileges of\nthe permissions and I can connect to it.\n\n488\n00:25:31.025 --> 00:25:35.705\nI can type that same\nlocation by typing again,\n\n489\n00:25:35.705 --> 00:25:42.434\n\\\\computername\\sharename and\nthis case it was, what was it?\n\n490\n00:25:42.434 --> 00:25:43.378\nIt was storage, right?\n\n491\n00:25:43.378 --> 00:25:48.576\nAnd if I want, I can also browse\nwhich kinda makes it easy.\n\n492\n00:25:48.576 --> 00:25:50.766\nSometimes, if you can't find it.\n\n493\n00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:54.378\n&gt;&gt; Or you can't remember the exact name of\nthat's all is to wanna guess means like\n\n494\n00:25:54.378 --> 00:25:55.991\nwhat is the name of that share?\n\n495\n00:25:55.991 --> 00:25:58.114\nJust browse, there it is,\nclick, and I'm done.\n\n496\n00:25:58.114 --> 00:25:59.878\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we have the GUI, right?\n\n497\n00:25:59.878 --> 00:26:03.989\nAgain, if you're into the command prompt,\nyou don't get all of this but\n\n498\n00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:08.381\nthat is the reason we're in the GUI and\nI could select that, I could choose OK.\n\n499\n00:26:08.381 --> 00:26:11.159\nAnd you have to have\nthe appropriate credentials, so\n\n500\n00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:13.145\nlet's say that I'm logged in as Dan.\n\n501\n00:26:13.145 --> 00:26:18.066\nAnd like we showed you on a past episode,\nDan was still in a standard user mode.\n\n502\n00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:19.298\nHe can't map this, right?\n\n503\n00:26:19.298 --> 00:26:23.888\nSo I can actually, or even Dan, if Dan\nis running according to best practices,\n\n504\n00:26:23.888 --> 00:26:27.056\nis running as a standard user but\nhas an admin account.\n\n505\n00:26:27.056 --> 00:26:30.393\nYou can actually connect using different\ncredentials, and it would give you\n\n506\n00:26:30.393 --> 00:26:34.036\nthe potential to enter those credentials\nwhen it connects to wherever the store is,\n\n507\n00:26:34.036 --> 00:26:35.131\nor the share is located.\n\n508\n00:26:35.131 --> 00:26:38.836\nNotice that I have the ability\nto map the drive letter, right?\n\n509\n00:26:38.836 --> 00:26:41.064\nSo I might wanna call it F, right?\n\n510\n00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:43.215\nI might want to call it the F drive,\nright?\n\n511\n00:26:43.215 --> 00:26:45.111\nSo I choose Finish.\n\n512\n00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:47.092\nNow, I want you to notice something.\n\n513\n00:26:47.092 --> 00:26:51.124\nNotice what happened,\nnotice it says this PC storage.\n\n514\n00:26:51.124 --> 00:26:52.930\nWell what is that gonna look like to me?\n\n515\n00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.268\nAll right, well,\nif I open File Explorer now, notice this.\n\n516\n00:26:56.268 --> 00:26:59.439\nNotice this Network location, but to me,\n\n517\n00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:03.940\nit no longer looks like a UNC path,\nat least not completely.\n\n518\n00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.050\nAnd what's kinda interesting here is that\nI could create a shortcut, all right?\n\n519\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.958\nAnd notice when I create a shortcut on\nthe desktop here, all I did by the way,\n\n520\n00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:13.803\nI know I did that kinda quick there.\n\n521\n00:27:13.803 --> 00:27:17.313\nNotice I did a create, right-click on it,\nchoose Create Shortcut.\n\n522\n00:27:17.313 --> 00:27:22.879\nWell, now out here I have this\nlittle storage location, right?\n\n523\n00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:27.904\nAnd as an end user I can tell\nthe end user just go ahead,\n\n524\n00:27:27.904 --> 00:27:32.930\nclick on that little drive icon,\nand I want you to save\n\n525\n00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:38.310\nwhatever you're working on\nup there on that hard drive.\n\n526\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.675\nNow to them it looks no different\nthan being a local drive but\n\n527\n00:27:41.675 --> 00:27:46.334\nwhat's going on in the background, again\nit just looks like the F drive, right?\n\n528\n00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:52.358\nBut we know that in the background\nit's actually //dco1/Storage,\n\n529\n00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:56.713\nso it's the UNC path without\nthem having to type it.\n\n530\n00:27:56.713 --> 00:27:58.441\nNow to take this a little bit further,\n\n531\n00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:01.627\none of the benefits we talked about\njoining a computer to the domain and\n\n532\n00:28:01.627 --> 00:28:04.328\nbeing able to control through GPO,\na Group Policy Object.\n\n533\n00:28:04.328 --> 00:28:07.837\nJust a setting that is\npushed out to this machine.\n\n534\n00:28:07.837 --> 00:28:11.788\nI can actually within one of\nthe settings I can say map this drive.\n\n535\n00:28:11.788 --> 00:28:16.113\nSo that when the user logs on, that\nicon is right up there on their desktop.\n\n536\n00:28:16.113 --> 00:28:17.809\nAnd as an administrator,\n\n537\n00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:22.056\nI could do this one time in\na centralized location on that server.\n\n538\n00:28:22.056 --> 00:28:26.810\nAnd I could pass that setting out to\nhundreds if not thousands of computers,\n\n539\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.051\nmaking it a lot easier, all right?\n\n540\n00:28:29.051 --> 00:28:33.570\nSo that is the difference between what a\nnetwork share is, an administrative share,\n\n541\n00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.713\nand mapping a drive.\n\n542\n00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:39.663\nUnderstand that when you're mapping\na drive it essentially looks no different,\n\n543\n00:28:39.663 --> 00:28:43.477\nI mean it's just like any other\ndrive inside of File Explorer.\n\n544\n00:28:43.477 --> 00:28:48.455\nBut now for the end user stand point it is\neasier than having to enter the UNC path\n\n545\n00:28:48.455 --> 00:28:50.499\nevery time you want to connect.\n\n546\n00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:53.017\nSo it makes it a lot\neasier on your end users.\n\n547\n00:28:53.017 --> 00:28:55.784\nNow Dan I know that's a few things to go,\nbut I'm looking at the clock here and\n\n548\n00:28:55.784 --> 00:28:57.886\nit looks like we're gonna do\nanother mini-series here.\n\n549\n00:28:57.886 --> 00:29:00.349\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem Wes,\nit's always a good time had by all and\n\n550\n00:29:00.349 --> 00:29:02.456\nthis is really good stuff,\nI love networking.\n\n551\n00:29:02.456 --> 00:29:06.214\nSo we could make this a 20 part series and\nI'd be thrilled to death about it.\n\n552\n00:29:06.214 --> 00:29:09.545\nHopefully you would be as well, cuz it's\na lot of fun to get computers to talk and\n\n553\n00:29:09.545 --> 00:29:13.213\ndo the right things and make them, I mean,\nit's the whole reason we got them, right?\n\n554\n00:29:13.213 --> 00:29:16.822\nIt's so that they'll communicate,\nmaking our lives easier, and\n\n555\n00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:18.288\nknowing how we can do that.\n\n556\n00:29:18.288 --> 00:29:20.397\nAnd then troubleshoot\nissues when they arise so\n\n557\n00:29:20.397 --> 00:29:21.986\nwe can get them back up and running.\n\n558\n00:29:21.986 --> 00:29:25.805\nWell, that's gonna make us a plus\nawesome people in our business, right?\n\n559\n00:29:25.805 --> 00:29:27.682\nSo that's what we wanna do.\n\n560\n00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:29.697\nWes thanks so much for\nyour insights on this so far.\n\n561\n00:29:29.697 --> 00:29:30.337\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n562\n00:29:30.337 --> 00:29:32.634\n&gt;&gt; And we do thank our good audience for\nwatching.\n\n563\n00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:35.725\nBut as you say we are out of time and\nit's time to sign off.\n\n564\n00:29:35.725 --> 00:29:37.919\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n565\n00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:38.717\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n566\n00:29:38.717 --> 00:29:40.821\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n567\n00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:46.676\n[MUSIC]\n\n568\n00:29:46.676 --> 00:29:50.285\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.167\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:08.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:12.111\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.011\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.057\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:19.851\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode well,\n\n9\n00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.828\nwe are moving on going forward\nwith more in our A plus series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:25.637\nSo hopefully that's what you've\ncome to see because that's what\n\n11\n00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:27.080\nwe're dishing up today.\n\n12\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.660\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain to continue our conversation\n\n13\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.050\non networking with\nthe Windows operating system,\n\n14\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.360\nvery fun stuff, joining us is\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.820\nWes, glad to have you yet again sir.\n\n16\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.184\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n17\n00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:39.858\nGreat to be here.\n\n18\n00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:42.915\nThat's right, we are continuing on\nwith Windows client networking.\n\n19\n00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:46.396\nAnd in the first part, well we really only\ngot through a couple of bullet points\n\n20\n00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:47.661\nbecause of the fact, well,\n\n21\n00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.123\nit's gonna be important understanding\nwhat a domain is versus a workgroup.\n\n22\n00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:54.826\nAs well as being able to join your\ncomputers to the domain in order to form\n\n23\n00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:59.025\nthat trust relationship, and have that\ndomain controller out there, be able to\n\n24\n00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:03.980\nessentially, just control the settings and\ncontrol the computing environment.\n\n25\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.182\nWe also talked about, a little bit about\nnetwork shares, administrative shares, and\n\n26\n00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:10.989\nwhat that really means for\nus and mapping network drives.\n\n27\n00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:15.619\nWe've basically showed you guys how\nyou can access the resources that\n\n28\n00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.561\nare out there on the network, essentially\nallowing you to store your files\n\n29\n00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.795\nin a location other than\nlocally on the machine.\n\n30\n00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:26.910\nAll right, so the next thing that we're\ngonna get into really can benefit you.\n\n31\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.220\nDoesn't matter if we're talking\nabout in just a home environment,\n\n32\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.120\nif we're talking about a SOHO environment,\nSmall Office Home Office,\n\n33\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.390\nif we're talking like a workgroup,\nwhere's there only ten computers, or\n\n34\n00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.600\nif we're talking about\na domain environment.\n\n35\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.473\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n36\n00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:44.956\nWell we're talking about everybody's, well\nI should say the IT's vein of existence,\n\n37\n00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:47.061\nand that is something known as printers.\n\n38\n00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:51.369\nAnd more specifically as we talked\nabout the hardware in the 901 series,\n\n39\n00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.760\nnow we're talking about how is that we\nmap, if you will, network printers?\n\n40\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.350\nHow do we essentially share printers?\n\n41\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260\nAnd that's what they call\nout in the objectives here,\n\n42\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.410\nprinter sharing versus\nnetwork printer mapping.\n\n43\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.553\n&gt;&gt; I'll get some garlic,\na stake, maybe some priests, and\n\n44\n00:02:05.553 --> 00:02:07.422\nthen we can take care of business.\n\n45\n00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nremember your Louisville Slugger too.\n\n46\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's your printer maintenance\n\n47\n00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:11.387\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n48\n00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:15.050\n&gt;&gt; For sure, and that will help you\ntake care of a lot of the problems.\n\n49\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.943\nWe're just kidding.\n\n50\n00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, [LAUGH] so\n\n51\n00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.155\ndo keep that in mind that.\n\n52\n00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:23.807\n[LAUGH] When it comes to printers, I mean\nyou're probably gonna be dealing with,\n\n53\n00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:25.846\nregardless of what kind\nof a network it is, or\n\n54\n00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.873\nnetwork architecture it is that\nyou are dealing with, all right?\n\n55\n00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:29.919\nSo I wanna go ahead and\n\n56\n00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.045\neven though they just say printer sharing\nversus printer network printer mapping,\n\n57\n00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:37.994\nI do want to take a little bit of time and\ntalk about the different types of printers\n\n58\n00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:42.100\nthat we have and comes down to understand\nthat we're talking about a print device.\n\n59\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.290\nWe're also talking about a piece\nof software that controls anything\n\n60\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.700\nthat you want to send to the printer,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.218\nIf we talk about a local printer, then\nwhat we mean is a printer that is attached\n\n62\n00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.756\ndirectly to your client operating system.\n\n63\n00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:59.004\nNow when I say that, understand that it\ncould be physical media, bounded media,\n\n64\n00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:03.190\nit could be some kind of wired cable, like\nUSB is common, or it could be a radiated\n\n65\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.510\nconnection, unbounded media like wireless,\ncould be Bluetooth, if you will.\n\n66\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.190\nAnd that's not just Windows, that's\nsupported in Linux, it's supported in Mac,\n\n67\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.110\nas well, to do things like\nthe Bonjour Service that we talk about in\n\n68\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.380\nlater episodes and things like air\nsharing or air print if you will.\n\n69\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.280\nBut, understand that what\nthat means is that the local.\n\n70\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.450\nLet's talk about the actual service,\n\n71\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.630\nspecifically in Windows that controls the\nprint job, when I need to print something.\n\n72\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.750\nLet's say that I've got\nthe Office Suite open.\n\n73\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.910\nI've gotta Word document up,\nand I need to print it.\n\n74\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.180\nWell, when I go to send it to the printer,\n\n75\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.510\nwe do have a service in Windows that\nallows us to send that job to the printer.\n\n76\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.540\nNow, a local printer, it means that you\nhave the local machine is controlling\n\n77\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.730\nthe print job and it is responsible for\nsending it directly to the printer.\n\n78\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.775\nLet me show you what I\nmean when I say service.\n\n79\n00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:57.570\nI've got a Windows 8.1 machine here, and\nif we just kind of right click on our\n\n80\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.770\nWindows tile here, and\ngo to Computer Management.\n\n81\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.800\nRemember, you could do this\nfrom the services console.\n\n82\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.240\nBut one of the things that we've\ntalked about in other episodes about\n\n83\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.990\nComputer Management is that it's\nkinda like your one stop shop.\n\n84\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.290\nIt's kinda like a convenience store,\n\n85\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.180\nif you will, for a lot of your\ndifferent utilities here, so.\n\n86\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.154\nIf we go to services and we've already\nmentioned I think in a couple episodes,\n\n87\n00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.260\nDan, we've mentioned the Print Spooler.\n\n88\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.950\nAnd if I get down in here and basically\nI like to click on the name column and\n\n89\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.895\ntype the first letter of\nservice I'm looking for,\n\n90\n00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:26.650\nespecially with Print Spooler cuz\nwe can find it right here up front.\n\n91\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.425\nNow, understand that by default,\nthe principle or service is, it's running,\n\n92\n00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:37.949\nand it is an automatic start up type,\nwhich means that as we start the machine,\n\n93\n00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.483\nthe principle or\nservice already start running.\n\n94\n00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:42.732\nWhile the principle or\n\n95\n00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:47.540\nservice inside of a Windows environment is\nreally what Microsoft calls the printers.\n\n96\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.905\nSo just be careful as you go into\nMicrosoft training, if you're going on\n\n97\n00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.800\nfurther training outside of Comtea\nunderstand that Microsoft doesn't call\n\n98\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.250\nthe physical printer, what you and I,\nwhat Dan and I would call the printer,\n\n99\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.670\nthey don't really call that the printer\nthey call that the print device.\n\n100\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.660\nThe printer itself is the service\nthat's responsible for\n\n101\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.930\nmanaging the print jobs and\nsending the message to the printer.\n\n102\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.510\nNow when it's a local printer, all right,\nnot to beat this one to death to much, but\n\n103\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.240\nwhen it's a local printer that means\nthat my local machine is controlling\n\n104\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.246\nessentially the print jobs,\nsending them directly to the printer.\n\n105\n00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:22.260\nNow, when you do print sharing,\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n106\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.775\nWell, essentially what we're doing\nis we're installing a printer, and\n\n107\n00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:29.568\nthen we're making it a shared resource\nover the network much like we talked about\n\n108\n00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:32.160\nin the first part when we\ntalked about network shares.\n\n109\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.670\nOne of the things that can be a network\nshare, even though on this context a lot\n\n110\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.126\nof times we don't call it a network share,\na network share we call a folder or\n\n111\n00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:41.719\na directory that people can\nstore their information in.\n\n112\n00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.269\nBut a shared printer essentially\nis another type of share,\n\n113\n00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:45.990\nit is a shared resource, right?\n\n114\n00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.696\nAnd that's what they\nmean by print sharing.\n\n115\n00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:51.940\nAnd now what happens is we have another\ndevice that could be managing your\n\n116\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.160\nprint job on your behalf.\n\n117\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.430\nNow understand that the principle or\n\n118\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.890\nservice in your machine does\nactually interact, for a little bit.\n\n119\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.430\nWhat it does, is it says, okay,\nwell I see this print job.\n\n120\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.834\nLet me look at the devices that I have,\nthe available printers.\n\n121\n00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.594\nI see that there's a shared printer\nout there that's been installed on\n\n122\n00:06:09.594 --> 00:06:10.200\nyour machine.\n\n123\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.620\nWe’ll show you how that process works.\n\n124\n00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.850\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna send that\nprint job over to the print server, and\n\n125\n00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.270\nthe print server is now\ngonna manage that job.\n\n126\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.670\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n127\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.260\nSo I'm on a Windows Server 2012 box and,\nladies and\n\n128\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.090\ngentlemen, you don't have to worry\nabout configuring your server\n\n129\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.670\noperating systems inside of Windows,\nbut I could share a printer out, right?\n\n130\n00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.950\nAnd let me show you how I can do this.\n\n131\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.040\nEssentially, what I can do is I can\nbasically, just like Windows 8.1,\n\n132\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.210\nI can right click on the desktop, and\nif I want to, I can go to Hardware, right?\n\n133\n00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.310\nAnd the great thing is it's the same\nthing inside of Windows 8.1.\n\n134\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.470\nI go into Hardware, here, and\nwe have Devices and Printers, all right?.\n\n135\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.592\nNow please understand that again they're\nnot gonna ask you about, if you will,\n\n136\n00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:55.602\nthe Windows server operating system.\n\n137\n00:06:55.602 --> 00:06:59.662\nBut if I'm not, to bump over here real\nquick to the Windows 8.1 operating system\n\n138\n00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:02.050\nin which they will ask you,\nand I right-click.\n\n139\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.110\nYou're gonna notice that\nthe interface is identical.\n\n140\n00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.210\nSo, this is slightly different,\n\n141\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.920\ncuz in servers you're not worried\ntoo much about sound, right?\n\n142\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.070\nWe focus all of our resources\non providing the services.\n\n143\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.530\nSo, you'll see that it is Hardware and\nSound.\n\n144\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.450\nBut then from here, minus the sound issue,\nor the sound location,\n\n145\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.120\nwhich they kinda have sound there.\n\n146\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.424\nIt's pretty much one and\nthe same, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:24.424 --> 00:07:27.193\nSo I'm going to go here and\nI'm going to add a device, and\n\n148\n00:07:27.193 --> 00:07:30.742\nin this case what I'm going to do is\nI'm gonna add a printer, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:35.310\nNow when I add a printer here,\nit's going to ask me, well is the,\n\n150\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.231\nlet's say is there available\nprinter out there at all?\n\n151\n00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:41.000\nWell, in this case there isn't.\n\n152\n00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.200\nI haven't shared a printer out.\n\n153\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.870\nBut if I want to,\nI could say you know what,\n\n154\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.560\nthe printer that I want isn't listed.\n\n155\n00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.890\nAnd there's a few different ways that\nwe can do print sharing here, right?\n\n156\n00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.730\nWe could find a printer in\nthe directory if it's all ready there.\n\n157\n00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.700\nI'll show you how that looks\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n158\n00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.439\nCuz we will find one\nin the directory soon.\n\n159\n00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:59.003\nI could share it by its UNC path, right?\n\n160\n00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:01.875\nRemember the UNC path we talked\nabout earlier in this episode or\n\n161\n00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:02.751\nin the first part.\n\n162\n00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:05.380\nComputer name, back slash, share name.\n\n163\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.854\nNow this is printername key be careful\nbecause that is technically a sharename or\n\n164\n00:08:09.854 --> 00:08:13.230\nI can do it by a traditional URL,\nuniform resource locator.\n\n165\n00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.670\nA couple different ways we can do\nprint sharing as well is I could do\n\n166\n00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.520\nadding a printer with TCP/IP settings so\nI can use an IP address.\n\n167\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.910\nRight, we'll talk a little bit more about\nIP later on in client networking here.\n\n168\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.840\nRemember I told you, it could also be\na Bluetooth or a wireless type printer,\n\n169\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.210\ncould be using some kind of SSDP\n(Simple Service Discovery Protocol).\n\n170\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.430\nLike for instance, if you're in a Mac\nworld, you could be using something like\n\n171\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:42.080\nair sharing or air print, or\nwe can do this locally, right?\n\n172\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.760\nNow, don't let that confuse you cuz\nwe're gonna share a printer out here but\n\n173\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.690\nwe're gonna it locally.\n\n174\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.086\nI know that's kinda confusing.\n\n175\n00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:48.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, let's go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:48.665 --> 00:08:51.190\nlet's continue to walk through this,\nall right.\n\n177\n00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.970\nSo, we're gonna choose Next.\n\n178\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.296\nAnd what I'm gonna is I'm just gonna\ncreate a new port, I'll tell you what,\n\n179\n00:08:56.296 --> 00:08:59.483\nI will use an existing port here and\nwe're gonna kinda trick it into this.\n\n180\n00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:02.590\nIt's gonna be a software\nbased printer here.\n\n181\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.420\nDon't worry about that.\n\n182\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.660\nBut we're gonna mimic the same thing\nwould be if we were physically plugging\n\n183\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.830\na cable in.\n\n184\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.510\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna pick the printer port.\n\n185\n00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.540\nIn this case,\nI'm just gonna do a local port here.\n\n186\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.470\nWe're gonna choose Next.\n\n187\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.280\nAll right, and\nthen I'm gonna pick a driver, right?\n\n188\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.310\nThat is important, right?\n\n189\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.750\nDrivers are important.\n\n190\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.580\nAnd in the Hardware episode, I talked\n\n191\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.620\npretty extensively about the different\ntypes of drivers that we have out there.\n\n192\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.710\nSo for our purposes here, we're gonna\nchoose Microsoft as the manufacturer.\n\n193\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.940\nWe're gonna use the Printer Control\nLanguage, PCL version 6, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.280\nAnd then we're gonna choose Next.\n\n195\n00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.740\nAnd, it note good,\nbecause I kinda ran through this earlier.\n\n196\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.870\nIt says hey,\nthe driver that is currently installed.\n\n197\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.220\nif not,\nit will just go through the wizard, or\n\n198\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.070\nyou could replace the current\ndriver either way.\n\n199\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.210\nSince it's all ready installed,\nwe'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n200\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.289\nNotice the printer name.\n\n201\n00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:51.920\nI'm gonna call this printer name,\nI'm gonna call this DC01.\n\n202\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.170\nIn fact, let me get out of my caps here,\ndc01_ and I'll call it, printer,\n\n203\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.770\njust for the name so that I can find it\nand I can identify it a little bit easier.\n\n204\n00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.230\nNow, remember, when we do printer sharing,\n\n205\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.320\nit's just like I told\nyou about with folders.\n\n206\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.020\nAnd sharing network resources,\nnetwork shares.\n\n207\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.610\nRemember I told you the network share,\n\n208\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.820\nthe UNC path to find it is\n\\\\computername\\sharename.\n\n209\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:21.690\nAnd the share name and the folder\nname do not need to be the same.\n\n210\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:26.430\nA lot of times people name the same thing\njust to make sure that it's not confusing.\n\n211\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.930\nBut I do wanna show you, that once I\nchoose Next, if I'm doing Printer Sharing\n\n212\n00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.170\nit says if you wanna share this\nprinter you must provide a share name.\n\n213\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.080\nAll right,\nnow it says you could use a suggested one\n\n214\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.510\nwhich tells me that it\nkeeps it consistent, right?\n\n215\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:49.160\nBut if I wanted to, let's say this was on\na sales floor I could say sales_printer.\n\n216\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.080\nRight, and I'm gonna go ahead,\nand I'm gonna change that name.\n\n217\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.180\nFor me, the printer name itself,\nI just know locally where\n\n218\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.950\nit's running on the machine, in this case,\nis the reason I kinda changed it.\n\n219\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.586\nThen I'll choose Next.\n\n220\n00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:00.330\nAll right.\n\n221\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.372\nNow, I can set this as\nthe default printer.\n\n222\n00:11:02.372 --> 00:11:04.800\nAll right, I'm not gonna Print a test\npage, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n223\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.170\nchoose Finish.\n\n224\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.720\nNow, notice that I have this\nprinter is here, right?\n\n225\n00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.710\nIt is now attached, this is a local\nprinter to me even though it's shared,\n\n226\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.680\nI'm on the machine that the printer was\ninstalled so that's a local printer.\n\n227\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.830\nNow, if I want to I can always,\nif I want to, I can right-click, I could\n\n228\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.800\nchoose the Printer Properties and I can\nmanage the printer from here if I want to.\n\n229\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.790\nI could choose the Sharing option, right?\n\n230\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.653\nAnd if I choose the Sharing option,\nI can now list it in the directory.\n\n231\n00:11:31.653 --> 00:11:34.910\nAnd that's what I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo so when we bump over to our client.\n\n232\n00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.670\nYou can see how you would\nattach a machine or\n\n233\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.620\nattach a client Operating System to\na printer or vice versa, depending on how\n\n234\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.740\nyour perspective there, to a printer\nthat's already been shared out.\n\n235\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.030\nSo we'll go ahead,\nwe'll list it in the directory here and\n\n236\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.830\nin the directory in this case,\n\n237\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.890\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna give me\nthe ability to find it when I go ahead and\n\n238\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.110\nI search for it through those options\nthat we just found in Hardware &amp; Sound.\n\n239\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.732\nAll right, so now that that's done,\nlet's go ahead, and\n\n240\n00:11:59.732 --> 00:12:02.309\nwe're gonna bump back over\nto our Windows 8.1 client.\n\n241\n00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:06.176\nAnd we're gonna see if we\ncould find our shared printer.\n\n242\n00:12:06.176 --> 00:12:10.310\nNow you can also do again, you talk\nabout mapping a network printer mapping.\n\n243\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.650\nWe could also map,\nthere are things like group policy,\n\n244\n00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:17.930\nin which we could pull down,\nopen up a GPO, a group policy object.\n\n245\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.610\nAnd we can essentially say, hey,\nevery time you log on to this computer,\n\n246\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.540\nwe're gonna apply that shared printer to\nyour devices and printers here, right?\n\n247\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.870\nAnd in fact if we go ahead,\nwe'll take a look here,\n\n248\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.900\nif I right-click on the Windows tile and\nI go to the Control Panel,\n\n249\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.900\nI go to Hardware and Sound and\nthen you can see Devices and Printers.\n\n250\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.670\nI can make it to where every time\nwe log on to this machine we've\n\n251\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.060\nmapped that network printer.\n\n252\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.835\nNow you can see that there are some\nprinters already here, by default.\n\n253\n00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:50.845\nAnd I do have one that's been shared out.\n\n254\n00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:51.865\nThis is actually one that we,\n\n255\n00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:55.405\nas you can see it's there at the ITProTV\nOffice, this is one of our black and white\n\n256\n00:12:55.405 --> 00:12:58.895\nprinters that are over on the floor where\nour host and our development team is.\n\n257\n00:12:58.895 --> 00:13:01.850\nBut maybe I want to add a printer\nthat's already been shared.\n\n258\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.082\nRight?\nThat's the beauty of print sharing,\n\n259\n00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:05.450\nrather printer sharing.\n\n260\n00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.130\nSo I can come in here and\nI could choose Add Printer.\n\n261\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.000\nNow, if I wait a bit, what I should\nend up seeing, and you know what?\n\n262\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.860\nIt isn't gonna happen.\n\n263\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.750\nI notice that I do have\nnetwork connectivity.\n\n264\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.690\nLet me go ahead real quick and\n\n265\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.950\nyou won't be able to find the printer\nif you're not on the right network.\n\n266\n00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.919\nSo let me go ahead and\nfix that real quick,\n\n267\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.980\nI should have checked the network\nadaptor here, we make sure okay, so yep.\n\n268\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.010\nAll right, so let me go ahead real quick\nand change the Network Adaptor settings\n\n269\n00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.440\nhere, like I said it does matter\nif you are on the right network.\n\n270\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Kinda hard to talk to\na computer on a different network,\n\n271\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.310\nwithout a router in the middle.\n\n272\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.032\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's absolutely correct,\n\n273\n00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:45.685\nwhich you'll go on to learn more about in\nour networking sections on the hardware,\n\n274\n00:13:45.685 --> 00:13:46.900\nas well as in network plus.\n\n275\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.895\nNow, let's give it a second and make sure,\n\n276\n00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:53.525\nlet me see, oops,\nI wanna cancel that out and\n\n277\n00:13:53.525 --> 00:13:59.135\nlet's see if we can find our DC, so\npick DCO1, do a little troubleshooting.\n\n278\n00:13:59.135 --> 00:14:01.295\nThere we go, so yeah I can find it,\nall right, perfect.\n\n279\n00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:02.845\nThat's what I want, all right.\n\n280\n00:14:02.845 --> 00:14:05.245\nNow, let's go ahead we'll Add the Printer.\n\n281\n00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:09.650\nNow you can see we've got\na couple of printers, all right?\n\n282\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.780\nNow, it's listed it by\ntwo different names.\n\n283\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.950\nAnd the reason I wanted to tell you that,\nagain, when you name a printer\n\n284\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.180\ndifferent than what the share is,\nthe directory only sees one printer.\n\n285\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.220\nNow, it sees it by two names and\nit's confusing it, so which one you want?\n\n286\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.130\nNow, you’ve seen that it's the same one\nand that's why we always say, go ahead and\n\n287\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.190\ngo with the suggestions,\nit makes it a little bit easier.\n\n288\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.490\nBut notice how I could find it right away?\n\n289\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.250\nAnd all I gotta do is choose Next,\nall right.\n\n290\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.100\nNow, let's see here, sales floor,\nI'll try that one more time.\n\n291\n00:14:39.182 --> 00:14:40.160\nThere we go.\n\n292\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.890\nAll right,\ndidn't like the first one there, but\n\n293\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.075\nnow notice that we've successfully\nadded the printer and\n\n294\n00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:51.200\nit lets me know dc01_printer, and\nit let's me know where it's connected to.\n\n295\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.360\nAll right, and it also lets me know that\nthe Driver's been installed that's one of\n\n296\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.450\nthe great things about\nlistening the directory,\n\n297\n00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.760\nis that it also takes that Driver, and\nit adds it to the directory, as well.\n\n298\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.760\nAnd that's a good thing, because you don't\nhave to walk around, do sneakernet, thumb\n\n299\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.560\ndrive, and plugging it into the computer\nand find the driver after the fact.\n\n300\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.160\nSo we'll go ahead and choose next, and\nI'm not gonna print a test page, or\n\n301\n00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.810\nanything here,\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n302\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:19.870\nAnd if I scroll down, what I should see\nhere is, oops, and let's try that again.\n\n303\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.430\nIs that I should see that we\nhave a printer right here.\n\n304\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.630\nNow, I can right-click on this and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n305\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.730\nset this as the default.\n\n306\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.990\nLooks like I changed it there for\na second.\n\n307\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.370\nAnd notice, that we now have\nour shared printer, all right?\n\n308\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.670\nNow, one of the great things\nabout these network printers and\n\n309\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.640\ndoing network printer mapping and printer\nsharing if you will, is the fact that,\n\n310\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.770\nif you have multiple printers within your\nnetworks and you go to the print server.\n\n311\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.320\nYou can always manage Drivers and\neverything from a centralized location and\n\n312\n00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.120\nthat's a good thing to be able to do like\nwe talked about in other episodes rather\n\n313\n00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.290\nthan having to go printer to\nprinter to printer to printer and\n\n314\n00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.460\nmanage these devices.\n\n315\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.366\nAll right, so that's a little bit on how\nto essentially do your printer sharing.\n\n316\n00:16:02.366 --> 00:16:07.073\nNow the other things that they call\nout on the exam are setting up for\n\n317\n00:16:07.073 --> 00:16:10.706\ninstance, Your different\nnetwork connections.\n\n318\n00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:12.002\nWell, where would we do that?\n\n319\n00:16:12.002 --> 00:16:14.010\nWell, there's a couple different\nways that we can get there.\n\n320\n00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.933\nIn fact, my head's kind of covering\nup one way, as it usually is.\n\n321\n00:16:16.933 --> 00:16:18.084\n[LAUGH] Big head, right?\n\n322\n00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:20.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All I gotta do is I can right\n\n323\n00:16:20.452 --> 00:16:25.016\nclick here on the little monitor icon\nwith a little trident pitchfork.\n\n324\n00:16:25.016 --> 00:16:28.006\nActually, it's a little ethernet cable, I\nalways thought it was a trident pitchfork.\n\n325\n00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:33.790\nBut if you zoom in, you can almost see\nthat it's a little RJ45 jack there.\n\n326\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.880\nAnd I choose Open Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n327\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.580\nWell, that's one way that\nwe can get there, and\n\n328\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.100\nit's definitely one way that\nI want you to be aware of.\n\n329\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.200\nHowever, we can also right-click\non the Windows tile here, and\n\n330\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.210\nwe can choose Control Panel.\n\n331\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.354\nWe can go to Network and Internet and\nthen the Network and Sharing Center.\n\n332\n00:16:48.354 --> 00:16:50.653\nNow it's the scenic approach to get there,\nbut\n\n333\n00:16:50.653 --> 00:16:53.021\nyou never know which way\nthey're gonna ask you.\n\n334\n00:16:53.021 --> 00:16:57.115\nAll right, now here's where if\nyou don't have a connection,\n\n335\n00:16:57.115 --> 00:16:59.220\nyou can set up a connection.\n\n336\n00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.002\nNow a lot of times, what happens is with\ntoday's plug and play with your network\n\n337\n00:17:03.002 --> 00:17:06.568\nadapters, a lot of times, you don't\nhave to set up connections, right?\n\n338\n00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:10.441\nYou're gonna have a wired cable\ncoming into your house, if you will,\n\n339\n00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:15.240\nwhether it's cable, whether it's DSL,\neven dial-up for that matter.\n\n340\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.130\nAnd the moment you plug that into the\nnetwork adapter, Windows recognizes it,\n\n341\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.170\nand it does a little bit\nof configuration for you.\n\n342\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.340\nNow, that's not always the case.\n\n343\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.530\nSometimes you have to set\nup a VPN communication.\n\n344\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.910\nSometimes you have to set up dial-up,\nor you have to set up wireless.\n\n345\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.030\nIf it's the case of wireless,\n\n346\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.150\nyou have to make sure that you have your\nwireless settings set appropriately.\n\n347\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.250\nIf it's a wired setting, a lot of times,\n\n348\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.970\nwhat you have to make sure is that\nthe IP configuration is correct as well.\n\n349\n00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.640\nWhich we'll show you a little bit\nmore about the IP configuration too.\n\n350\n00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.600\nNow you could also do things like, for\ninstance, wireless wide area networks, and\n\n351\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.090\nthat's your cellular connections too.\n\n352\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:55.390\nBut that typically takes, well, I guess,\nlike any wired or any Internet connection\n\n353\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.150\nor network connection that you have,\ntypically is a subscription based.\n\n354\n00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.970\nKeep in mind that, technically,\nif you're setting up network connections,\n\n355\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.650\nyou don't have to have\nan Internet connection.\n\n356\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.890\nBut most networks are gonna have some\nkinda Internet connection today.\n\n357\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.740\nLet's go ahead and show you how you can\nset up a different connection, right?\n\n358\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.440\nSo if you notice here, it says,\nchange your network settings.\n\n359\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.640\nWe can set up a new connection if we want.\n\n360\n00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.865\nAll right, and we've got a couple\nof different options here, right?\n\n361\n00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:23.015\nI can connect to the Internet,\nI can set up a new network.\n\n362\n00:18:23.015 --> 00:18:27.027\nYou can set up a wireless router\nif you want or an access, well,\n\n363\n00:18:27.027 --> 00:18:30.437\nnew router access point,\nAP wireless access point,\n\n364\n00:18:30.437 --> 00:18:35.145\nif you will, or\nyou can connect via dial-up or VPN, right?\n\n365\n00:18:35.145 --> 00:18:36.365\nLet's go ahead, and I'll tell you what.\n\n366\n00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.905\nSince we've already got an Internet\nconnection, let's go ahead, and\n\n367\n00:18:38.905 --> 00:18:44.720\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nchoose to connect to a workplace or VPN.\n\n368\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.140\nAll right, so, if I go through this,\nright, it's gonna tell me,\n\n369\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.220\nuse my Internet connection and\nconnect using a virtual private network.\n\n370\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.220\nAnd then I can walk through this,\nand it tells me,\n\n371\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.470\nit says set up an Internet connection, do\nyou wanna set this up before continuing?\n\n372\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.030\nI'm not gonna set this up right now,\nagain, because we really don't need it.\n\n373\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.930\nWhat I want is the VPN communication.\n\n374\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.850\nI also wanna show you it\nfrom the new interface.\n\n375\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.370\nThis is the way it would\nalso look like in Windows 7.\n\n376\n00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.206\nLet's show you the Modern or\nMetro UI here in Windows 8.1.\n\n377\n00:19:10.206 --> 00:19:13.360\nAll right, so if I go ahead, and I get\nout of Network and Sharing Center, and\n\n378\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.125\nmy head's gonna kinda cover this one up.\n\n379\n00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:19.560\nBut I kinda just basically take my cursor\nover here to the side to where we get\n\n380\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.120\nthe Charms menu and I go to Settings.\n\n381\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.920\nI could turn around, and\nI can go to PC Settings.\n\n382\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.450\nAnd now we got an interface that's\na little bit different, right?\n\n383\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.270\nAnd then from here,\nI can choose the Network option.\n\n384\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.200\nAll right, and\nnotice that I have this add VPN.\n\n385\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.160\nNow I've already got\nan ethernet wired connection.\n\n386\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.706\nThat's why I'm not worried about\nthis one connecting to the Internet,\n\n387\n00:19:38.706 --> 00:19:41.370\nreally not worried about\nthat at this point.\n\n388\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.960\nBut I do wanna try to add\na VPN connection, right?\n\n389\n00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.330\nMaybe you wanna make\nan encrypted communication\n\n390\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.020\nover a public network\nback into your workplace.\n\n391\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.000\nWell, that's the beauty of\na Virtual Private Network or VPN.\n\n392\n00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.770\nNow, it does require you to\nhave a client side VPN, and\n\n393\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.850\nthey call it a VPN provider here.\n\n394\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.290\nBut it's essentially a lot of times,\nwhat we call it,\n\n395\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.370\njust in jargon, is VPN client, right?\n\n396\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:08.260\nWell, the great thing is Windows 8.1 has\nsome already built in for you by default.\n\n397\n00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.508\nNow I'm gonna go ahead, and\nwhat I'm gonna use is the Microsoft VPN or\n\n398\n00:20:12.508 --> 00:20:14.100\nVPN client, if you will.\n\n399\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.390\nAnd again, they call it VPN provider.\n\n400\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.170\nAnd then for me, I'm just gonna call this,\nwhat will I call this?\n\n401\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.869\nI'll call this Work Network\nbecause I'm that creative.\n\n402\n00:20:22.869 --> 00:20:25.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now the next thing is,\n\n403\n00:20:25.042 --> 00:20:28.920\nI could do a server address or I could do,\nor a server name or an address.\n\n404\n00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.410\nKeep in mind if you use a server address,\n\n405\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.780\nthat means that that server\naddress has to be resolvable.\n\n406\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.050\nAll right,\nyou can also do this by IP address, so for\n\n407\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:42.810\ninstance, maybe I'll do a 192.168.1,\nI tell you what,\n\n408\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:48.510\nwe're gonna do one that's\na little bit different.\n\n409\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.985\nWe're gonna go ahead cuz I know my IP\naddress is already 192.168 something or\n\n410\n00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:54.755\nother we could see it here.\n\n411\n00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:57.645\nLet's go ahead and\nuse a completely different IP address.\n\n412\n00:20:57.645 --> 00:20:58.655\nThat's what we're gonna set up.\n\n413\n00:20:58.655 --> 00:21:01.415\nBecause what's kind of interesting\nis if I use the same IP address as\n\n414\n00:21:01.415 --> 00:21:04.205\nthe local network adapter, well,\nI'm really not doing a VPN.\n\n415\n00:21:04.205 --> 00:21:07.233\nI'm just basically on the same\nprivate network here, so\n\n416\n00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:10.403\nwhat we'll do is we'll end up go ahead and\nwe'll connect.\n\n417\n00:21:10.403 --> 00:21:14.574\nWe'll make sure that our other network\nadapter does look like it is on the right\n\n418\n00:21:14.574 --> 00:21:15.150\nnetwork.\n\n419\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.151\nSo now I've got a 192.168 adapter,\n\n420\n00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:23.158\nnow I also got a 10.10.10 network.\n\n421\n00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:25.620\nSo that's gonna keep it\nbasically multihome.\n\n422\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.800\nSo our local traffic is going\nto one network adaptor, and\n\n423\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.770\nour VPN communication is gonna go\nover a completely different network.\n\n424\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.730\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nput our server IP address.\n\n425\n00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:40.702\nAnd this just happens to be the IP\naddress of the VPN server that\n\n426\n00:21:40.702 --> 00:21:42.153\nwe have on the back end.\n\n427\n00:21:42.153 --> 00:21:45.305\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm not\ngonna put in a username and password.\n\n428\n00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.541\nI'm gonna do this just, and\nyou could do this right here, and\n\n429\n00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:50.235\nthen you could save it and\nyou don't have to worry about clicking.\n\n430\n00:21:50.235 --> 00:21:52.990\nBut I kinda wanna show you some of\nthe properties of the VPN connection\n\n431\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.665\nafter the fact.\n\n432\n00:21:53.665 --> 00:21:57.635\nSo we'll go ahead and\nauthenticate when we make the connection.\n\n433\n00:21:57.635 --> 00:22:00.828\nAll right, so once that's done,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll choose Save.\n\n434\n00:22:00.828 --> 00:22:07.270\nGive this a second, and now we see that\nwe got a Work Network VPN communication.\n\n435\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.160\nNow from here,\nI can't really do anything with it.\n\n436\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.418\nI can remove it, or\nI could edit it, right?\n\n437\n00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:13.630\nI don't wanna do that, right?\n\n438\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.163\nSo now we're gonna go bump back\nover to our traditional Network and\n\n439\n00:22:17.163 --> 00:22:18.928\nSharing Center, all right?\n\n440\n00:22:18.928 --> 00:22:23.020\nAnd what has happened is we've\nactually set up a completely different\n\n441\n00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.490\ntype of network connection.\n\n442\n00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.990\nAnd if i go to adapter settings,\n\n443\n00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.080\nyou should see that I have\na Work Network here, all right?\n\n444\n00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.050\nI've got my VPN communication,\n\n445\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.810\nand I've got the protocols\nthat are associated with it.\n\n446\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.490\nNow if I select this, and\n\n447\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:41.500\nI choose Connect, now we see the other\nconnections that we have, right?\n\n448\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.544\nI have my wired connection here, I've got\nanother unidentified connection here.\n\n449\n00:22:45.544 --> 00:22:50.285\nThat's actually the other adapter\nthat it's gonna use to make this VPN\n\n450\n00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:51.479\ncommunication.\n\n451\n00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:54.430\nAnd I could choose Work Network,\nand I can choose Connect.\n\n452\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.041\nNow you have to be able\nto authenticate and\n\n453\n00:22:57.041 --> 00:23:01.828\nunderstand that this is not something\nyou have to worry about for this exam.\n\n454\n00:23:01.828 --> 00:23:06.990\nBut you do have to make sure that your\nconnection is set up on the VPN side.\n\n455\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.190\nFor instance,\n\n456\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:13.050\nyou have to allow the user to be able to\nmake a remote access connection, right?\n\n457\n00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:17.317\n&gt;&gt; That's inside of the active directory\nproperties of the user right now, right?\n\n458\n00:23:17.317 --> 00:23:18.630\n&gt;&gt; You got it absolutely correct.\n\n459\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.231\nAnd you know what's interesting here, and\n\n460\n00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:22.050\nthen this one might throw some people for\na loop.\n\n461\n00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.530\nUsually the administrators, enterprise,\ndomain, default administrators,\n\n462\n00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.940\nthey can do whatever they want.\n\n463\n00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.900\nNot so, your administrative account isn't\ngranted the ability to perform a remote\n\n464\n00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.890\naccess connection, and\nthat's for security purposes.\n\n465\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.870\nSo I'm doing this in a closed environment.\n\n466\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.257\nSo I'm not worried about\na security vulnerability.\n\n467\n00:23:40.257 --> 00:23:44.192\nA lot of times and almost all the time,\nyou never want a default administrator to\n\n468\n00:23:44.192 --> 00:23:46.380\nbe able to make a remote\naccess connection.\n\n469\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.592\nBecause everybody is aware that that\naccount exists, including the hackers.\n\n470\n00:23:50.592 --> 00:23:55.707\nSo understand this is just for purposes\nof showing you guys how to set this up.\n\n471\n00:23:55.707 --> 00:23:59.932\nNow if you rewind the episode a little\nbit, you might notice that it started out,\n\n472\n00:23:59.932 --> 00:24:04.350\nand it said ike version 2, that's\nthe Internet key exchange version 2.\n\n473\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.636\nThat's a very good connection.\n\n474\n00:24:05.636 --> 00:24:06.616\nIt's very good protocol.\n\n475\n00:24:06.616 --> 00:24:08.153\nAs you guys go on into network clusters,\n\n476\n00:24:08.153 --> 00:24:10.789\nsecurity clusters, you'll learn\nway more about these protocols.\n\n477\n00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:15.046\nBut then it Flipped over to an older\nprotocol that really Microsoft invented\n\n478\n00:24:15.046 --> 00:24:18.038\nway back in the 90s,\nI don't know, 93ish or so,\n\n479\n00:24:18.038 --> 00:24:20.805\ncalled Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n480\n00:24:20.805 --> 00:24:22.750\nWell, why did that happen?\n\n481\n00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.315\nWhy did it flip these automatically?\n\n482\n00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:28.533\nAnd this is where I want you to just\nkind of see some of the properties.\n\n483\n00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:32.529\nThis is why I didn't wanna do the\nauthentication right there, because then\n\n484\n00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:37.035\nit becomes transparent and I wanted you\nguys to see that flip over like that.\n\n485\n00:24:37.035 --> 00:24:38.291\nNotice that I have Properties here.\n\n486\n00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:42.718\nWhen I right-click on the connection,\nthis gives me the ability,\n\n487\n00:24:42.718 --> 00:24:47.165\nlet's say I accidentally type that\nname wrong or I wanna switch it.\n\n488\n00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:48.518\nI'm not getting name resolution.\n\n489\n00:24:48.518 --> 00:24:51.240\nI can't resolve the name,\nthere's no way I can hit the VPN.\n\n490\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.050\nWell, I could come in here and\n\n491\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.580\nI could change it from the named IP\naddress and we could do a little bit of\n\n492\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.630\ntroubleshooting to see if it's\nDNS that's causing the problem.\n\n493\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.130\nBut I also have the options, and again,\nremember my credentials so, if I decide\n\n494\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.770\nthat I want that and I don't wanna burden\nany of the end users, you can do that.\n\n495\n00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.990\nBut security,\nhere's the big one right here.\n\n496\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.750\nWhat type of VPN do we have?\n\n497\n00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.040\nWell, it's a good thing about a Microsoft\nclient, if you're in a Microsoft world,\n\n498\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.916\nMicrosoft client,\nit can automatically figure it out.\n\n499\n00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:17.870\nAnd it'd be no different than\nif you were in the Cisco world.\n\n500\n00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.800\nYou got a Cisco client,\nyou got a Cisco router,\n\n501\n00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.710\nyou got a Cisco Access Point,\nwell, guess what?\n\n502\n00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.819\nThey can communicate and\nthey can do it automatically.\n\n503\n00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:29.850\nWe're not worried about\nauthentication at this point in time.\n\n504\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.670\nWhat kind of authentication methods\nwe're using is well beyond the scope of\n\n505\n00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.520\nthis exam.\n\n506\n00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.540\nBut I did want to at least show you\nthat you do have the ability to set up,\n\n507\n00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.710\nnot only set up the VPN connection, but\nyou can also modify it after the fact.\n\n508\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.683\nAll right, so Dan,\nI see that we're coming up on time here.\n\n509\n00:25:46.683 --> 00:25:50.050\nI think we could fit in just\none more little tidbit here,\n\n510\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:55.570\nthat they call out, and that's something\nknown as proxy settings, all right?\n\n511\n00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.330\nWhat is a proxy?\n\n512\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.800\nWe talk about a proxy, a lot of times what\nwe're talking about very basically is\n\n513\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.300\nwe're talking about what's\nknown as a web proxy.\n\n514\n00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.720\nThere are other types of proxies.\n\n515\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.993\nThere are DHCP proxies, if you will.\n\n516\n00:26:06.993 --> 00:26:08.850\nYou have remote access proxies.\n\n517\n00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:14.306\nBut really what a proxy comes down to it,\nis that it sits in between, in this case,\n\n518\n00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:17.710\nsince we're in Windowsj, let's say\nthe Windows Client Operating System, and\n\n519\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.390\nsome kind of service that's being\nprovided, right, by typically a server.\n\n520\n00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:27.150\nWell, you have middleman, woman, person,\nif you will, sitting in between, and\n\n521\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.290\nwhat happens is, typically without\nthe proxy, the request goes to a server.\n\n522\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.210\nThe server responds back to\nthe client with the service or\n\n523\n00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.504\nwhatever was requested.\n\n524\n00:26:36.504 --> 00:26:41.415\nWell, with a proxy, you actually have\nanother server, another device that\n\n525\n00:26:41.415 --> 00:26:45.148\nsits in the middle and when a request\nis made, it's sent to the proxy.\n\n526\n00:26:45.148 --> 00:26:48.420\nAnd then the proxy does\nsomething kinda unique.\n\n527\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.570\nWhat the proxy does is it generates\na completely new request.\n\n528\n00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.780\nAnd it sends it to the end,\nwherever the service is being provided.\n\n529\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.378\nThat service is then provided back to the\nproxy, and then finally it's sent back to\n\n530\n00:27:01.378 --> 00:27:04.278\nthe original Windows client\nthat made the request.\n\n531\n00:27:04.278 --> 00:27:05.971\nSo what are the benefits of the proxy?\n\n532\n00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:09.255\nAll right, well, the benefits of the proxy\nare we can control Internet access\n\n533\n00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:11.420\nright from that location,\nright from your proxy.\n\n534\n00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.225\n&gt;&gt; Right from your bones and teeth.\n\n535\n00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:13.491\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n536\n00:27:13.491 --> 00:27:16.073\n[LAUGH] Absolutely, and\nwe can do things like auditing, right?\n\n537\n00:27:16.073 --> 00:27:19.327\nWe can say hey, well, I want Dan's\ncomputer as an administrator to be able\n\n538\n00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:22.515\nto connect out to the Internet, but\nI don't want Wes as a standard user.\n\n539\n00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:25.540\nWes's connection to go\ndirectly out to the internet.\n\n540\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.930\n&gt;&gt; I love the connection sharing\ncapabilities of a proxy.\n\n541\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.938\nIt's a really quick and\neasy way to set up.\n\n542\n00:27:29.938 --> 00:27:33.368\nIf you only have one IP address to\nshare out and you can't do natting for\n\n543\n00:27:33.368 --> 00:27:35.710\nwhatever reason,\nproxies are a good way to go.\n\n544\n00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:36.519\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, yeah.\n\n545\n00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:40.334\nIn the earlier days, well,\nthey still have it in Windows today.\n\n546\n00:27:40.334 --> 00:27:42.844\nWe call that ICS, right,\nInternet Connection Sharing, right?\n\n547\n00:27:42.844 --> 00:27:44.451\nSo it's a great technology to have.\n\n548\n00:27:44.451 --> 00:27:48.650\nLet me show you here in\nInternet Explorer where you would set up\n\n549\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.070\nbasically your proxy setting.\n\n550\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.980\nIf you're in a corporate environment,\na lot of times this is gonna be\n\n551\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.810\ncontrolled through your Active Directory\nconfiguration settings,\n\n552\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.476\nthrough what are known\nas group policy objects.\n\n553\n00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:59.430\nBut let me show you here\non the client side,\n\n554\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.090\nif I launch up our Internet Explorer,\nand it shouldn't connect here,\n\n555\n00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.420\nbecause I don't have an outbound\nInternet connection.\n\n556\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.860\nWe can go to those Internet options\nthat we've shown you in other episodes,\n\n557\n00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.780\nin the Control Panel Utilities episode,\nwhere we go to our little gear icon and\n\n558\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.520\nwe go to Tools, and then I can go\nto Connections here, all right?\n\n559\n00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.390\nRemember that we could set up our\nconnections just like we're showing you,\n\n560\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.230\nsetting up network connections here.\n\n561\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.370\nI could do that here.\n\n562\n00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.820\nBut if I scroll down a little bit,\nyou'll see that there are LAN settings.\n\n563\n00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.390\nAnd in our LAN settings, if I wanna use a\nproxy server for your LAN, understand that\n\n564\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.230\nit says it doesn't apply to dial-up or\nVPN connections, which is just fine.\n\n565\n00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.540\nWe're not worried about that right now.\n\n566\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.370\nBut I could use the proxy, and\nwhatever the proxy server might be,\n\n567\n00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:46.150\nI would just type in its IP address here,\nand making sure there's no letters in it.\n\n568\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.515\nPat, may we buy a vowel?\n\n569\n00:28:47.515 --> 00:28:48.930\n[LAUGH] And then,\n\n570\n00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.085\nfrom here what I can do is I can\nchoose OK, I can apply that setting.\n\n571\n00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:55.460\nAnd now, in this case,\nif it's gonna let's say connect, and\n\n572\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.245\nI know it's not gonna connect right here,\nbut if it was gonna connect outbound to\n\n573\n00:28:58.245 --> 00:29:01.850\nITProTV, it would actually be\nsending it to the proxy server.\n\n574\n00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.777\nThe proxy server would generate\na completely new request and\n\n575\n00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:07.090\nsend it to ITProTV.\n\n576\n00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.856\nAnother benefit of the proxy server,\nand let me go ahead and\n\n577\n00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:12.100\nshow you how to undo these settings.\n\n578\n00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.510\nI'm going back to Connections.\n\n579\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:17.650\nNow the benefit of the proxy server,\nin general, is from a security standpoint,\n\n580\n00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.110\none of the things that,\nto the rest of the world,\n\n581\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.150\nespecially across the Internet there,\n\n582\n00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:26.340\nis the fact that the Internet doesn't\nknow that your client sent the request.\n\n583\n00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.370\nIt only understands the proxy.\n\n584\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.980\nSo it also does something called reducing\nthe attack surface of your internal\n\n585\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.225\nclients, because again, to the outside\nworld, they only see the proxy request.\n\n586\n00:29:36.225 --> 00:29:40.065\nThey don't see what's going on that it's\nactually coming from another client and\n\n587\n00:29:40.065 --> 00:29:42.135\nit gives you a little bit\nof this obscurity, right?\n\n588\n00:29:42.135 --> 00:29:46.925\nWe talk about security through obscurity\nin other courses that we have.\n\n589\n00:29:46.925 --> 00:29:51.605\nIt just means that you kind\nof obscure the fact that that\n\n590\n00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:53.115\nclient is even making a request.\n\n591\n00:29:53.115 --> 00:29:54.017\nSo it's a good thing to have.\n\n592\n00:29:54.017 --> 00:29:58.975\n&gt;&gt; Even more so, because it is actually,\nyou're not making a direct connection,\n\n593\n00:29:58.975 --> 00:30:02.260\nso you are protected\nbehind the proxy server.\n\n594\n00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n595\n00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.600\nNow I have to say, Dan, like I said,\nwe've got a lot more to go,\n\n596\n00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.330\nbut I can see that time has\ndefinitely creeped up on us.\n\n597\n00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.640\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, it ticks away just\nway too fast, doesn't it, Wes?\n\n598\n00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.927\nWe're having a good time and\nall of a sudden the clock is done.\n\n599\n00:30:13.927 --> 00:30:16.545\nSo well, it looks like we’re\nmoving into a part three.\n\n600\n00:30:16.545 --> 00:30:18.307\nSo definitely join us for that,\n\n601\n00:30:18.307 --> 00:30:22.368\nbecause this is one of the best parts\nof being a part of computers, right?\n\n602\n00:30:22.368 --> 00:30:22.941\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n603\n00:30:22.941 --> 00:30:25.247\n&gt;&gt; Networking, learning how to\nget these things to talk and\n\n604\n00:30:25.247 --> 00:30:28.045\nmaybe different types of network\nconnections; a lot of fun stuff.\n\n605\n00:30:28.045 --> 00:30:29.565\nSo join us back for part three.\n\n606\n00:30:29.565 --> 00:30:31.395\nAs for this one,\nwe thank you for watching.\n\n607\n00:30:31.395 --> 00:30:33.905\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI’ve been your host, Daniel Lowrie\n\n608\n00:30:33.905 --> 00:30:34.955\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n609\n00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:35.859\n&gt;&gt; And we’ll see you next time.\n\n610\n00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:42.969\n[MUSIC]\n\n611\n00:30:42.969 --> 00:30:46.166\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.334\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:12.195\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:14.054\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:17.160\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.900\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n8\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.880\nwe are moving on with more\nof our A+ series as usual.\n\n9\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.302\nAnd joining us, back in the studio yet\nagain, lending himself to us so\n\n10\n00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:29.206\nwe might learn from him,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:30.901\nWes, glad to have you yet again, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.510\nHow is it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Man, its going great.\n\n14\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.941\nThat's right,\nanother miniseries within a series.\n\n15\n00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n16\n00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.450\nwe are in part three of\nWindows Client Networking.\n\n17\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.785\nAnd well,\nclient networking is gonna be important,\n\n18\n00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:45.210\nespecially even as a help desk technician,\nif you are a bench tech and\n\n19\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.610\nhappen to be working in, maybe you're\nnot working in a corporate environment.\n\n20\n00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.570\nMaybe you're just working at\nthe local computer repair store.\n\n21\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.740\nKeep in mind that networking\nis very important, right?\n\n22\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.294\nI know Dan and I, we both really enjoy\nnetworking, and you might say to yourself,\n\n23\n00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:00.882\nwell, wait a second, Wes.\n\n24\n00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:05.117\nThis is A+, we're gonna be learning\nabout computers, why do you spend so\n\n25\n00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:07.690\nmany times in our third\nparty on networking?\n\n26\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.111\nWell, one of my teachers told me at one\npoint, and I definitely, over the years,\n\n27\n00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.140\nbelieve that he was right on\nthe money when he said this.\n\n28\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.787\nHe said, if you don't understand\nnetworking within today's computing\n\n29\n00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.021\nenvironment, he says,\n\n30\n00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:23.278\nchances are all you're gonna do\nis deliver the computer in a box.\n\n31\n00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:25.270\nAnd you won't be opening it, right?\n\n32\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.430\nBecause everything that we do today\ncenters around networking, right?\n\n33\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.000\nCommunication and sharing resources, it\ndoesn't matter if you're talking about our\n\n34\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.990\nmobile devices, doesn't matter\nif you're talking about laptops.\n\n35\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880\nIf you're talking about Rokus, even\ncable television for that matter, right?\n\n36\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.051\nEverything is networked at some point,\nso that's why it's very, very important.\n\n37\n00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.540\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's move on in some of our objectives.\n\n38\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.640\nIf you guys and gals out there are\nfollowing along with us, remember this has\n\n39\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.310\ngiven a scenario, install and configure\nWindows networking on a client or desktop.\n\n40\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.240\nAll right, so in the past episodes we\ntalked about a lot of different things.\n\n41\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.731\nDomain set ups,\nwe talked about network shares.\n\n42\n00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:08.814\nWe talked about things like UNC paths,\nprinters, the different types of network\n\n43\n00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:12.990\nconnections you can establish, and\nwe left off with proxy settings, right?\n\n44\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.920\nEssentially, a proxy is nothing more than\nkinda like a middleman, if you will,\n\n45\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.020\nbetween a client asking for a resource and\nthe resource being delivered.\n\n46\n00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.860\nNow, moving on, there are some other\nthings that we also have to be aware of\n\n47\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.160\nwhen it comes to basic computing\ninside of a Windows environment.\n\n48\n00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.040\nAnd this one, a lot of times,\nreally centers around either remote\n\n49\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.920\nadministration, remote support,\nor both, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.930\nSo the next couple of topics that we're\ngonna talk about are gonna be something\n\n51\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.000\nknown as remote desktop, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.380\nRemote Desktop Connection is\nthe software that runs it, but\n\n53\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.570\nsometimes you might hear it called,\nRemote Desktop.\n\n54\n00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.920\nIt uses a protocol,\nremember in our networking,\n\n55\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.160\nwe were talking about different\ntypes of protocols right, and\n\n56\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.720\nwe mentioned that port 3389,\nRDP remote desktop protocol.\n\n57\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.950\nSometimes you'll even hear the jargon,\nas we say,\n\n58\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.990\njust RDP into that that Windows machine,\nright?\n\n59\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.070\nAnd a lot of times what that means is\nwe're using the Remote Desktop Connection\n\n60\n00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.720\nsoftware over RDP.\n\n61\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.510\nRight, so that'll be the first\nthing that we talk about.\n\n62\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.790\nNow, when we talk about\nRemote Desktop Connection software,\n\n63\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.390\nI want you to understand the way\nit was explained to me, and\n\n64\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.460\nthe way I've been explaining it\nto people for a few years now.\n\n65\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.930\nWell, ever since I started teaching,\nis that it allows you to connect over\n\n66\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.820\nthe network from one Windows\nmachine to the next.\n\n67\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.070\nAnd control that Windows machine that\nyou're connecting to no differently than\n\n68\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.190\nyou would if you sit down in front of\nthe monitor and you log in locally.\n\n69\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.440\nSo what do I mean when I say,\ntake control over the desktop?\n\n70\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.370\nWell, let’s go ahead and show you, in\nfact, I’ve got a couple of machines here.\n\n71\n00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.031\nAnd the great thing is, this works on\nWindows 7, works in Windows 8, 8.1,\n\n72\n00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:46.750\nVista, pretty much all the same.\n\n73\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.160\nSo you can learn one software, and\nit applies across all [LAUGH] of your\n\n74\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.300\neditions of Windows,\nversions of Windows, really.\n\n75\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.690\nSo that is a great thing to keep in mind.\n\n76\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.440\nNow, the way you find Remote Desktop\nConnection is a little bit different\n\n77\n00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.050\nbetween the two.\n\n78\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.560\nSo I do wanna take a second and\nshow you that, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.290\nIf you're on a Windows 7 box, all right,\n\n80\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.710\none of the ways that you can find it\nis to go to your Start button, right?\n\n81\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.170\nAnd from your Start button, you go to\nAll Programs, then you go to Accessories.\n\n82\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.382\nAnd then from Accessories you'll see,\nthere is Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n83\n00:04:14.382 --> 00:04:18.290\nAll right now, if you're on a Windows\n8.1 box, it's a little bit different.\n\n84\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.205\nBecause when I look, well I don't really\nhave, and let me show you guys and\n\n85\n00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:26.500\ngals out there if you forgot how\nto log into a Windows machine.\n\n86\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.670\nProbably should have done\nthat before we started.\n\n87\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.310\nBut I have the modern UI, all right and\none of the things that I don't really see\n\n88\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.850\nhere is, well,\nthe Windows Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n89\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.080\nSo what I can do here is I\ncan type remote, right, and\n\n90\n00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.230\nfrom there I get\nRemote Desktop Connection, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.905\nThe other thing that you can do in\nboth of the operating systems is well,\n\n92\n00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.216\nWindows 7 in the the Start search field or\n\n93\n00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:59.053\nthe traditional run line,\nis you can also type mstsc.exe.\n\n94\n00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:04.183\nNow, keep in mind that this\nwill launch an executable.\n\n95\n00:05:04.183 --> 00:05:07.494\nAnd in Windows 8.1 it is\nintuitive enough to know that hey,\n\n96\n00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:11.430\nwhat you mean here is\nthe Remote Desktop Connection software.\n\n97\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.890\nBut this is actually an executable,\nit's been around for a long time,\n\n98\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.340\nand it's been around so long that\nthey really haven't changed the name.\n\n99\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.970\nEven though today it's called\nRemote Desktop Connection,\n\n100\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.980\nin the earlier days it used to be called\nMicrosoft's Terminal Services Client.\n\n101\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.060\nRight again, client-server architecture,\n\n102\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.610\nwe'd have a client requesting to make\na connection to another machine.\n\n103\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.760\nThe other machine would be considered\nthe server, so it's M-S-T-S-C.\n\n104\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.420\nNow, I like to let you guys and gals out\nthere know that, because it'll help you\n\n105\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.090\nwhen it comes to trying to memorize\nthis little run line command.\n\n106\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.390\nSo that's just the leftover remnants\nfrom the earlier terminal services,\n\n107\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.880\nis what it used to be called and\nwas known for a very long time.\n\n108\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.300\nSo it's Microsoft Terminal\nServices Client, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.320\nAnd then I can run Remote Desktop here,\nall right?\n\n110\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.020\nNow, that being said,\nlet's talk about a few of the options.\n\n111\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.030\nNow, I kinda did that kinda fast there, so\nlet me show you what we have here, right?\n\n112\n00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.840\nSo the computer that you're gonna\nconnect to is what you are going,\n\n113\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.540\nthe name of the computer or\neven IP address.\n\n114\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.670\nOkay, keep in mind that if you use\nthe name here, it's gonna rely on\n\n115\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.950\na NetBIOS name, or it's gonna rely\non a fully qualified domain name.\n\n116\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.440\nSo it does have to find it,\nit has to be resolvable.\n\n117\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.151\nBut you can also put an IP\naddress here as well.\n\n118\n00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:28.745\nAll right, now, the other thing\nI want you to keep in mind too,\n\n119\n00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:31.800\nis that we have a few options, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.570\nAnd if I choose that Hide Options\nis what it changes to, but\n\n121\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.810\nif I choose Show Options, we could\nactually make modifications essentially to\n\n122\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.240\nhow Remote Desktop Connection\nis gonna interact with this.\n\n123\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.310\nThings like the quality of the connection,\nif you have a limited amount of bandwidth,\n\n124\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.080\nyou might want to tone down some\nof the resources that you have, so\n\n125\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.240\nthat you get a better connection.\n\n126\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.960\nIt's a more steady connection, and it's\nnot as unreliable if you're asking for\n\n127\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.300\nthings like better graphics.\n\n128\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.560\nFor instance we can,\nwhen we talk about display,\n\n129\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.398\nright, I can modify how high I want\nthe quality of the color right?\n\n130\n00:07:04.398 --> 00:07:08.380\nAnd I could say, hey, go ahead and\ndisplay it in full screen, right?\n\n131\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.790\nExperience, we can go a little bit\neven farther than that, right?\n\n132\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.280\nI always use these to detect the quality\nautomatically, and Windows will do it.\n\n133\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.780\nAnd if it senses that you\nhave a limited connection,\n\n134\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.360\nit'll kinda throttle down\nthe resources that it's using.\n\n135\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.220\nBut you could even tell it, you could\ndefine what kind of setting you have.\n\n136\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.250\nA lot of times, ladies and\ngentlemen out there,\n\n137\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.970\nI really just leave this to\nwhat it wants to detect it at.\n\n138\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.430\nAll right, let's see here,\nAdvanced Server authentication,\n\n139\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.490\nwe're not gonna worry about this.\n\n140\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.320\nIf you're on an external network,\n\n141\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.340\nyou might have to put in what's\nknown as a remote service, or\n\n142\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.670\nit's called an RDS Gateway,\na Remote Desktop Services Gateway.\n\n143\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.640\nAgain, I wouldn't worry about that for\nthis exam.\n\n144\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.625\nHowever, you can also say, hey,\ndo we wanna display the remote audio?\n\n145\n00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.394\nWhich means that if I do something,\nlike Wes likes to do,\n\n146\n00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.394\nI like to do something wrong,\nand get the little Windows Chime\n\n147\n00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:03.283\nthat comes out that says hey, do you wanna\nsend that back over your connection?\n\n148\n00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:05.370\nHow do you wanna interact with a keyboard?\n\n149\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.950\nAnd this one is really, really important.\n\n150\n00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.018\nI absolutely love this one because there's\ntimes that I'm, let's say, on my Windows 8\n\n151\n00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:15.731\nmachine, I have a file and I want to send\nit to the machine that I'm connecting to.\n\n152\n00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:20.443\nWell, I can also do, choose more and\nI could say, you know what,\n\n153\n00:08:20.443 --> 00:08:25.575\ngo ahead and get, let me connect\nmy local drive on this machine.\n\n154\n00:08:25.575 --> 00:08:29.710\nSo that when I need to over the connection\nI can take, for instance, a driver and\n\n155\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.254\nI can send it over to that machine\nthat I'm connecting to remotely.\n\n156\n00:08:33.254 --> 00:08:37.424\nThat's why I said it's a little bit\nbetween remote administration and\n\n157\n00:08:37.424 --> 00:08:39.710\nactual sometimes Help Desk as well.\n\n158\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.480\n&gt;&gt; I love that drives that I plug in\nlater, cuz I'll always have that USB drive\n\n159\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.580\nlaying around and we're like, yeah,\nit's on the USB drive, click.\n\n160\n00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.544\nAw, now I've got to reconnect\nto make sure that, no.\n\n161\n00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:53.838\nYou just make sure that's plugged in\nevery time you plug your flash drive in,\n\n162\n00:08:53.838 --> 00:08:56.210\nand.there it just pops up\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great point,\n\n163\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.720\nI wanna kind of expand that.\n\n164\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.700\nI'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n165\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.490\nKeep in mind that if you\nmake a connection, and\n\n166\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.010\nthese settings aren't set,\njust like Dan said.\n\n167\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.034\nIf you remember after the fact,\nthat's okay, just go ahead and\n\n168\n00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:07.218\ncancel the connection.\n\n169\n00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:10.710\nClose it down and then you can reconnect.\n\n170\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.610\nOr close it down, modify the options,\nand then reconnect.\n\n171\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.096\nAll right, so that's a little bit\nabout the option that you can see.\n\n172\n00:09:17.096 --> 00:09:21.317\nI do want you guys out there to keep in\nmind that there are some things that you\n\n173\n00:09:21.317 --> 00:09:24.960\ngotta set up to allow remote\ndesktop connection to work.\n\n174\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.680\nSo we're gonna connect over\nto a Windows 7 machine.\n\n175\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.180\nBut before we do that,\nlet's ensure that our Windows 7 machine\n\n176\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.450\nis configured correctly to\nreceive the incoming connections.\n\n177\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.090\nAnd there's one of things I want you\nto understand what you have to do.\n\n178\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.130\nI want you to remember, you gotta\nget to your system Control Panel and\n\n179\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.140\nnot Computer,\nyou gotta get to system Control Panel.\n\n180\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.943\nAnd you can just push the Start button,\nif you want.\n\n181\n00:09:45.943 --> 00:09:47.819\nYou can right-click, and\ncan choose Properties.\n\n182\n00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:50.930\nOr you can go the other ways that we've\nshown you through the Control Panel.\n\n183\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.570\nNotice that we have a couple\nof task links here.\n\n184\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.520\nOne of them's Remote settings, right?\n\n185\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.070\nAnd this brings up your System Properties\ndialogue box, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.980\nAnd you have three options here,\nall right?\n\n187\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.390\nNow, by default, exam alert,\nexam alert and, by the way, exam alert.\n\n188\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.200\nRemote Desktop is disabled by default,\nokay?\n\n189\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.480\nNow notice that when I\nopen this dialog box,\n\n190\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.310\nit said all right,\nit'll allow the connection.\n\n191\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.810\nThat is not the default setting,\nI want you to understand that.\n\n192\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.540\nAnd I'm gonna compare and\n\n193\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.420\ncontrast that to another remote\nconnection that you can make.\n\n194\n00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.470\nThe other thing I want you to keep in\nmind is not only when you turn this on.\n\n195\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.731\nYou also have to worry about this little\nwarning that it's giving you here.\n\n196\n00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:31.895\nIt's letting you know that this\ncomputer is set to go to sleep or\n\n197\n00:10:31.895 --> 00:10:33.815\nhibernation when not in use, right?\n\n198\n00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:36.959\nPeople cannot connect to machine that\nis in a hibernated state, right,\n\n199\n00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.927\ncuz that'd be, essentially, turned off.\n\n200\n00:10:38.927 --> 00:10:41.010\nAll right, so keep that in mind as well.\n\n201\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.170\nThe next thing I wanna let you guys know\nis, and let me just double check and\n\n202\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.600\nmake sure,\ncuz I don't think I modified anything.\n\n203\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.740\nAll right, the other thing you\nalso have to keep in mind too,\n\n204\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.670\nis that you have a potential for\nfirewall settings to get in the way.\n\n205\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.970\nIf firewall settings get in the way,\n\n206\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.320\nyou're not gonna be able\nto communicate too.\n\n207\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.640\nSo what you're gonna have to do is\nyou're gonna have to drop down,\n\n208\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.520\na lot of times it'll set it by default.\n\n209\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.902\nI have found in times, in certain\ncircumstances, you know computing, Dan,\n\n210\n00:11:06.902 --> 00:11:10.200\ninsight it doesn't always work\nthe way we want it for sure.\n\n211\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.650\nThat the firewall doesn't allow\nthe exceptions through the firewall.\n\n212\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.190\nSo let me go ahead and drop down to\nour firewall here real quick and\n\n213\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.620\nshow you where we can modify that.\n\n214\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.260\nSo we're gonna go to Start,\nwe're gonna go to Control Panel.\n\n215\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.630\nThen go to System and Security, and\n\n216\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.920\nwe're gonna look at our firewall\nsettings in the Windows Firewall.\n\n217\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.271\nAll right now, remember,\nit doesn't say exceptions.\n\n218\n00:11:31.271 --> 00:11:34.391\nIn the exam objectives we\ntalk about configuration,\n\n219\n00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:38.820\nwe talk about exceptions but\nwhat does it mean for an exception?\n\n220\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.226\nWell, the rule is by default that the\nWindows Firewall blocks everything coming\n\n221\n00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:45.901\ninbound from another\ncomputer to your machine.\n\n222\n00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:49.111\nWhich would include\nRemote Desktop by default, so\n\n223\n00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:51.431\nI have to make exemption to the rule.\n\n224\n00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:55.652\nThe rule is everything's blocked, we allow\nan application through the firewall,\n\n225\n00:11:55.652 --> 00:11:57.760\nwe're making an exemption to the rule.\n\n226\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.373\nSo we would choose allow\nan application through the firewall.\n\n227\n00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:08.770\nNow, when we go here, understand that this\nis an administrative privilege, right?\n\n228\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.530\nDan and I, we've talked about in other\nepisodes the User Account Control, and\n\n229\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.710\nI think Dan,\nyou mentioned the little shield here.\n\n230\n00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.180\nIf I see the shield,\nI have to be an administrator.\n\n231\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.340\nNow, I'm already in\nan administrative account,\n\n232\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.630\nyou see how it's grayed out,\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n233\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.630\nThe other thing that you can tell,\ntoo, is that this entire, sorry guys,\n\n234\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.990\nthis entire section would be grayed out.\n\n235\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.360\nAnd then you push the button, change\nsettings, and it's like you can see here,\n\n236\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.810\nit darkens up a little bit.\n\n237\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.890\nBut, in this list, we have to make sure.\n\n238\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.940\nYou notice this setting right here,\nRemote Desktop.\n\n239\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.000\nAll right, I have to make sure that\nthe Remote Desktop is checked.\n\n240\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.070\nNow the other thing I want you to\nkeep in mind is that we have profiles\n\n241\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.590\ninside of the Windows Firewall.\n\n242\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:57.610\nNow these profiles are directly\nrelated to network location.\n\n243\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.543\nYour Windows operating supports something\nknown as NLA, Network Location Awareness.\n\n244\n00:13:02.543 --> 00:13:03.720\nNow what does that mean?\n\n245\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.220\nThat sounds like it's big old high tech\ntechnology and, for the most part,\n\n246\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.690\nit's cool technology, but\nit's not really high tech.\n\n247\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.840\nJust means that, if you make a choice\nof which network you're connected to,\n\n248\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.790\nsoftware can be aware of that and\n\n249\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.640\nalso make configurations\nto the Windows Firewall.\n\n250\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.170\nAnd what we mean by that is,\nyou have three different work locations.\n\n251\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.490\nA potential for\none to be a fourth one, if you will,\n\n252\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.920\nbecause it's called work as well.\n\n253\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.130\nSo you have Home, Work and Public.\n\n254\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.330\nYou also have Domain,\nwhich is the fourth one I should say.\n\n255\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.020\nBecause Domain shows up, when like this\ncomputer, it's joined to a domain.\n\n256\n00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.310\nDomain and Work are pretty\nmuch close to the same thing.\n\n257\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:47.070\nBy default Domain does not\nturn on network discovery.\n\n258\n00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.330\nHowever, in Home and Work,\nnetwork discovery is turned on and\n\n259\n00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.479\nthat means that other computers\ncan find you on the network.\n\n260\n00:13:53.479 --> 00:13:58.409\nSo when you have a network setting, or you\nset the network to Home, what you have is,\n\n261\n00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:03.280\ninside of the Windows Firewall, you have\na profile that is configured, alright.\n\n262\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.920\nAnd it means that it's a global suite\nof settings based on the choice,\n\n263\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.220\nthe network location, that you've set.\n\n264\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.919\nIf you choose the Public profile,\nthe Public setting network location,\n\n265\n00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:17.131\nthen it's the most restrictive.\n\n266\n00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:20.672\nBecause you don't want to go into\na hotspot, a public location, and\n\n267\n00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:24.140\nhave people be able to share files\nwith your machine by default.\n\n268\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.720\nBe able to discover your computer, so it\nshuts off things like network discovery.\n\n269\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.860\nIt shuts off things like\nyour public file sharing.\n\n270\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.940\nSo understand a little bit\nabout what's going on here, and\n\n271\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.050\nremember which location,\nwhich network you've selected.\n\n272\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.800\nBecause, just because I have\nRemote Desktop turned on,\n\n273\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.110\nif my network location changes, let's\nsay to Public, I won't be able to, and\n\n274\n00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.290\nI know my head's kind of covering it up,\nthere we go.\n\n275\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.465\nIf it changes to Public,\nI won't be able to connect.\n\n276\n00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:58.188\nSo I would have to come in here and check\nthat setting to allow that to happen,\n\n277\n00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:00.122\nand it's up to you whether you do that.\n\n278\n00:15:00.122 --> 00:15:03.866\nSo we're gonna go ahead and,\nand that's network discovery,\n\n279\n00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:07.559\nthat's not what I want, so\nwrong setting, let's turn that off.\n\n280\n00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:13.202\nLet's go back to Remote Desktop and\njust make sure that it is set to,\n\n281\n00:15:13.202 --> 00:15:18.660\nacross all of the different profiles,\nand it is set to all three.\n\n282\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.380\nAnd I'll choose OK, and\nnow what we've done, is configured it.\n\n283\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.735\nNow keep in mind,\nwe've talked about in other episodes too,\n\n284\n00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:26.440\nthat you can also disable\nthe firewall here.\n\n285\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.410\nWe don't disable firewalls, all right?\n\n286\n00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.652\n&gt;&gt; Where's the fun in that, Wes?\n\n287\n00:15:29.652 --> 00:15:32.661\n&gt;&gt; That's right, leave the front\ndoor to your house open, and\n\n288\n00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:33.851\nthen walk away from it.\n\n289\n00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:36.295\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen sprinkle diamonds on the porch.\n\n290\n00:15:36.295 --> 00:15:37.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, no,\n\n291\n00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:38.855\nthat would be bad.\n\n292\n00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.925\nI will tell you that in some instances,\n\n293\n00:15:40.925 --> 00:15:43.562\nif you believe the firewall's\ncausing an issue,\n\n294\n00:15:43.562 --> 00:15:47.925\nyou can disable it temporalily just to\nfind find out if you've misconfigured it.\n\n295\n00:15:47.925 --> 00:15:50.120\nHowever, you always turn it back on.\n\n296\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.175\nAll right, so, it looks,\nwe'll keep our fingers crossed here, Dan,\n\n297\n00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:57.245\nthat we do have Remote Desktop\nconfigured correctly.\n\n298\n00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:59.450\nNow let me show you what\nI mean when I say And\n\n299\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.175\nRemote Desktop allows you to take\ncontrol of the desktop, all right?\n\n300\n00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:07.272\nWe're gonna switch back over to our\nWindows 8.1 machine, all right.\n\n301\n00:16:07.272 --> 00:16:11.009\nI'm gonna put in the computer name which\nI pretty much already have here and\n\n302\n00:16:11.009 --> 00:16:11.731\nmy username.\n\n303\n00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:14.020\nAnd I'm gonna choose connect.\n\n304\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.800\nAll right, now If this is connecting,\nall right,\n\n305\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.450\nyou get an authentication dialogue box.\n\n306\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.720\nThat's what you wanna see.\n\n307\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.190\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nbreak this for a second, on purpose,\n\n308\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.460\nbecause I wanna show you what would\nhappen if your network adapter is not, is\n\n309\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.290\nsomething wrong with your network adapter,\nyour computer's in the hibernate state,\n\n310\n00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.940\nlike it warned you there or\nif your firewall is blocking this.\n\n311\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.010\nSo let me show you here,\n\n312\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.052\nreal quick, what it would look like\nif it doesn't connect, all right?\n\n313\n00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:45.500\nIt does give you a warning.\n\n314\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.750\nSo I'm just gonna disable Remote Desktop,\nhere,\n\n315\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.370\nand that'll cause it to throw the error.\n\n316\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.230\nAll right, and you'll notice right away\nhow it doesn't go right to the dialog box.\n\n317\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.930\nThat's a tell tale sign\nthat something's wrong.\n\n318\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.770\nYou don't know what's wrong, at this\npoint, again it could be the firewall,\n\n319\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.620\ncould be the computer's in\na hibernation or a sleep state.\n\n320\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.034\n&gt;&gt; It's erasing the C drive.\n\n321\n00:17:03.034 --> 00:17:05.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Erasing the C drive, that's right.\n\n322\n00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:06.686\n[LAUGH] Downloading\na virus to your machine.\n\n323\n00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:07.416\n&gt;&gt; It's great stuff.\n\n324\n00:17:07.416 --> 00:17:09.580\n&gt;&gt; But notice that it does\ngive you a warning here.\n\n325\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.580\nRemote access to\nthe server is not enabled.\n\n326\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.190\nNow, keep in mind you're not.\n\n327\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.210\nThe server is a mindset of the operating\nsystem or a functionality if you will.\n\n328\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.200\nIt just means that, that computer is\nnot receiving an incoming connection.\n\n329\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.930\n&gt;&gt; I like how they do give\nyou a really good idea of\n\n330\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.590\nthe most common possibilities of\nwhy you're not connected, right?\n\n331\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.640\nThe remote computer is\nnot available on network.\n\n332\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.305\nThat's right, it could be,\n\n333\n00:17:30.305 --> 00:17:34.390\nI'm sitting there going l want\nconnection all day long but\n\n334\n00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:39.730\nthe cable got unplugged, you know, or the\nport on the switch it's plugged into died.\n\n335\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.640\nAnd it's just unavailable\nat this point in time.\n\n336\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.140\nThe network connection\nis down all together.\n\n337\n00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.790\nThere's no, the ISP had a fiber cut,\nyou never know, these things can happen.\n\n338\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.280\nSo you obviously wanna check,\nhey, you know, call someone,\n\n339\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.930\ncan you go and check and\nmake sure that computer's turned on?\n\n340\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:54.530\nI've had to do that.\n\n341\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n342\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the lights are on.\n\n343\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.430\nOkay, now I got bigger fish to fry.\n\n344\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n345\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.130\nAnd like you said,\n\n346\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.440\nat least it gives you some kind\nof indication of what's going on.\n\n347\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.630\nSo let's go ahead, and\nlet's fix the problem.\n\n348\n00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.892\nAnd no, the problem in this case is not\nthat Wes was touching the keyboard.\n\n349\n00:18:07.892 --> 00:18:09.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It knew it was you,\n\n350\n00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.063\nit was like, just shut all the blinds.\n\n351\n00:18:12.063 --> 00:18:12.569\n[LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:13.653\nAnd don't answer the door.\n\n353\n00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:14.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wes, step away from\n\n354\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:15.810\nthe keyboard, that's right.\n\n355\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.510\nSo, we'll go ahead and say ok to this and\nthen we're gonna reconnect.\n\n356\n00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.660\nAnd I wanna go ahead and show you\nthat when I log into this machine.\n\n357\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.446\nLet me go ahead and log in and\nshow you what happens.\n\n358\n00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:27.100\nI get locked out of the Windows 7 blocks,\nright?\n\n359\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.650\nIf I do CTRL, ALT, DELETE, notice it\ntells me that I'm logged on remotely.\n\n360\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.328\nAnd then it gives you the name here.\n\n361\n00:18:33.328 --> 00:18:36.090\nLet's see if we can, yeah,\nyou could see the name.\n\n362\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.650\nRemember, this is why we say\ntaking control of the desktop.\n\n363\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.330\nOnly one person can be logged\ninto a Windows machine\n\n364\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.640\ncontrolling the desktop at one time,\nright?\n\n365\n00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.630\nThat isn't a limitation inside a Unix\nbased system or a Linux system, right?\n\n366\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.270\nLinux systems are true multi-user systems.\n\n367\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.810\nAnd the fact that you can have\nmultiple sessions logged into a single\n\n368\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.660\nphysical piece of hardware.\n\n369\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.100\nThat's not the case with Windows.\n\n370\n00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.200\nSo that's what we mean when we say\ntaking control of the desktop.\n\n371\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.610\nDid you notice I just basically wrestled\nit away from the instance that I was\n\n372\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.457\nlogged into.\n\n373\n00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:12.698\nAll right, the other thing to keep in\nmind when we say, taking control over\n\n374\n00:19:12.698 --> 00:19:16.246\nthe desktop, and you can see we still have\nthe Windows Control Panel open just like\n\n375\n00:19:16.246 --> 00:19:19.487\nwe did, is the fact that, let's say\nDan wants to help me do something, but\n\n376\n00:19:19.487 --> 00:19:21.670\nhe wants me to see what's going on.\n\n377\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.303\nRemote Desktop is not a good solution for\n\n378\n00:19:24.303 --> 00:19:28.185\nthat because if you notice,\nI cannot see what's going on?\n\n379\n00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no collaboration when\nit comes to remote desktop.\n\n380\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.380\nThat's like, when you said at\nthe beginning, this was basically for\n\n381\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.870\nremote administration,\nthat was nail on the head right there.\n\n382\n00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:43.270\nSystem administrators or that they're not\ngonna be there, they're gonna be at lunch,\n\n383\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.150\nhey, I'm gonna take over your computer\nbecause you've got admin rights.\n\n384\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.220\nAnd you don't need any\noutside help from anybody.\n\n385\n00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.430\nYou're just gonna log in, do whatever\nwork you have to do, when you're done,\n\n386\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.270\nyou disconnect, and\nit's all said and done.\n\n387\n00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.659\nBut that's when we get into\nremote systems, right, Wes?\n\n388\n00:19:56.659 --> 00:19:57.919\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct, and\n\n389\n00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:00.315\nthat's gonna be the next one that\nwe are gonna tackle right here.\n\n390\n00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:04.741\nBut I do wanna get props out cuz we always\ngot our viewers out there in the chat room\n\n391\n00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:08.335\nthat always chime in with\nsome very good advice, right?\n\n392\n00:20:08.335 --> 00:20:11.505\nAnd what we have in the chatroom,\nI know you can't see it right now,\n\n393\n00:20:11.505 --> 00:20:14.345\nis that you've mistyped the IP address,\nall right.\n\n394\n00:20:14.345 --> 00:20:16.105\nThat is a great thing to keep in mind and\n\n395\n00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:18.921\nlet me show you real quick\nbecause there's another one too.\n\n396\n00:20:18.921 --> 00:20:22.200\nYou can mistype the name too,\nsame results would apply.\n\n397\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.142\n&gt;&gt; Notice that I get this log off ability,\nright, and\n\n398\n00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:29.122\nmy normal start button if you will,\nI can disconnect or I can log off.\n\n399\n00:20:29.122 --> 00:20:34.062\nLet me tell what I always do; I always log\noff of a machine and here is why, because\n\n400\n00:20:34.062 --> 00:20:38.515\nif I stay logged on there are certain\ntimes when that can be problematic.\n\n401\n00:20:38.515 --> 00:20:43.198\nIf you stay logged off and you just\ndisconnect your session is still active,\n\n402\n00:20:43.198 --> 00:20:43.720\nright?\n\n403\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.520\nAnd that could be consuming resources\non a machine that maybe you don't\n\n404\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.370\nwanna consume.\n\n405\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.640\n&gt;&gt; That's the way daddy likes it though.\n\n406\n00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n407\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.130\nSo the next thing that we're\ngonna do is let's move into\n\n408\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.500\none that Dan talked about, right?\n\n409\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.810\nWhere we wanna actually share\ncontrol over the desktop.\n\n410\n00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.280\nNow in order to do this, you're gonna use\nsomething known as remote assistance.\n\n411\n00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.990\nLike Dan mentioned, let's go ahead and\n\n412\n00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.820\nlet's get logged back in\nto our Windows 7 machine.\n\n413\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.880\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n414\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.210\nwe're gonna fire up our remote\nassistance connection, right?\n\n415\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.370\nAnd we'll show you how to share\ncontrol over the desktop.\n\n416\n00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.120\nSo in this situation, there's a couple\nof different things that we can do.\n\n417\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.800\nOne of the easiest ways to\nfind remote assistance is to,\n\n418\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.629\nessentially do nothing more then well,\na couple different ways.\n\n419\n00:21:23.629 --> 00:21:28.530\nIf l go to all programs, l believe is it's\nAccessories, and l believe if l come down\n\n420\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.092\nhere to Tools, System Tools, l believe\nwe find remote assistance in there.\n\n421\n00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:33.869\nAnd I am not seeing.\n\n422\n00:21:33.869 --> 00:21:34.978\nIt's been a while since I've actually.\n\n423\n00:21:34.978 --> 00:21:35.787\n&gt;&gt; There any more.\n\n424\n00:21:35.787 --> 00:21:38.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been a while since\nI've actually launched it up.\n\n425\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.420\nBut here's the way I typically\nfind Remote Assistance.\n\n426\n00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.590\nThere is an executable called MSRA, and\n\n427\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:50.100\nit is an executable, so know that,\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n428\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.855\nThe other place that I know you\ncan get to as well is if I go to,\n\n429\n00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:57.310\nwhere is our,\nI'm trying to remember, our Help?\n\n430\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.260\nOops, I don't know.\n\n431\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.020\nI got Caps Lock on here.\n\n432\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.430\nHelp and Support, right?\n\n433\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.880\nIs another place that I\nknow you can get to it.\n\n434\n00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.020\nAnd what we can do is, we can Ask,\nnotice that we have an option here, right?\n\n435\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.008\nWe can ask and\nI believe this is where you can get help\n\n436\n00:22:13.008 --> 00:22:17.765\nas soon as it gets through\nits help content here.\n\n437\n00:22:17.765 --> 00:22:19.193\nLet's see if I cancel that out.\n\n438\n00:22:22.597 --> 00:22:23.740\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n439\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.870\nNotice that I say, ask a person for help\nyou can launch it through a hyperlink.\n\n440\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.630\nSo there's a couple different ways,\nhelp and support, you can get to it.\n\n441\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.019\nI really like the msra,\n\n442\n00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:35.130\nand again, this is just because I\ndon't have to search around for it.\n\n443\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:40.900\nI just type msra and that's just short for\nMicrosoft Remote Assistance, all right?\n\n444\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.260\nNow when you do this,\nwhat you're gonna do,\n\n445\n00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.310\nis there's a couple of\nthings that you can do.\n\n446\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.620\nLargely speaking,\nwhat we do more often than not,\n\n447\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.790\nis we end up sending what is\nknown as an invitation, right?\n\n448\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.180\nAnd there's a couple of different\nways that you can do this,\n\n449\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.810\nwhen you send an invitation like this.\n\n450\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.270\nEssentially, I have to invite somebody.\n\n451\n00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.510\nI can ask somebody, essentially,\nhey, I need your help.\n\n452\n00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:09.445\nI need you to show me how to do whatever\nit might be inside of the operating\n\n453\n00:23:09.445 --> 00:23:10.116\nsystem.\n\n454\n00:23:10.116 --> 00:23:13.140\nAnd we can see the remote assistance\nwindow come up here, right?\n\n455\n00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.420\nSo there's two sides of the tracks,\nall right?\n\n456\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.310\nInvite somebody you trust to help,\nall right?\n\n457\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.770\nAnd there's a couple of different ways.\n\n458\n00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.040\nNow, if you're on the same network,\n\n459\n00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.710\nyou could have used this easy connect\nif were' on the same network.\n\n460\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.940\nBut I'm not on the same network, so\n\n461\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.740\nwhat I'm gonna do is save\nthis to an invitation file.\n\n462\n00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.360\nNow I have to save it to a common\nlocation where, let's say,\n\n463\n00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.380\nDan could get a hold of it.\n\n464\n00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.240\nSo let me go ahead and kind of double\nback on something we showed you guys in\n\n465\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.530\nan earlier part here in client networking.\n\n466\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.020\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna open up Windows Explorer.\n\n467\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.170\nAnd we didn't who you this.\n\n468\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.490\nWe showed you how to do this in WIndows 8,\n8.1.\n\n469\n00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.914\nBut I didn't show you how to do\nthis inside of the Windows Explorer\n\n470\n00:23:48.914 --> 00:23:49.495\nin Windows 7.\n\n471\n00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:52.859\nSo if I choose Computer,\nup here at the top, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n472\n00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:54.494\nI'm gonna map a network drive.\n\n473\n00:23:54.494 --> 00:23:56.993\nAnd we're gonna do the same\nthing that we did before.\n\n474\n00:23:56.993 --> 00:24:00.076\nI'm gonna just call this F drive,\nlike I did in the first part here.\n\n475\n00:24:00.076 --> 00:24:04.485\nAnd I'm going to essentially use\nthat network share that we had out\n\n476\n00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:06.210\nthere on the network.\n\n477\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.920\nI'll choose Finish, and\nif I do, there we go.\n\n478\n00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.750\nSo I need a place to store this where the\nperson who's gonna help me can get a hold\n\n479\n00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.160\nof this file.\n\n480\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.420\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nsay Save an imitation file.\n\n481\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.135\nAnd I'm gonna save it to that location,\nthat network share that we've just mapped,\n\n482\n00:24:22.135 --> 00:24:22.798\nall right?\n\n483\n00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:26.246\nAnd notice that it says invitation,\nand you can see the extension here.\n\n484\n00:24:26.246 --> 00:24:28.809\nWe'll go ahead and choose Save.\n\n485\n00:24:28.809 --> 00:24:34.369\nNow keep this dialogue box open,\nright, because this is essentially\n\n486\n00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:40.980\na password that you're gonna need after\nopening the invitation file, all right?\n\n487\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.300\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's jump over to Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n488\n00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.310\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and go to the\nmodern UI, metro UI as they used to call\n\n489\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:55.740\nit, and type MS RA as well, and\nyou could see it's executable.\n\n490\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.710\nAnd now notice it says,\nHelp someone whose invited you, all right?\n\n491\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:05.786\nSo we;re gonna go ahead and choose that\nto help somebody whose invited me.\n\n492\n00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:08.912\nAnd you know what, it looks like it fell\nback on the network connections again.\n\n493\n00:25:08.912 --> 00:25:13.213\nLet me cancel that out and see what\nhappen with my network connection.\n\n494\n00:25:13.213 --> 00:25:13.782\nNo?\n\n495\n00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:19.180\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n496\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.773\nI should be, I'm gonna do a little\ntroubleshooting here real quick.\n\n497\n00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:27.850\nOkay, so I still have access,\nI wanted to make sure I do.\n\n498\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.021\nAll right, so let's close,\nand you know what?\n\n499\n00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:34.287\nWe've got to, I still got the VPN,\nthat's what it is.\n\n500\n00:25:34.287 --> 00:25:38.381\nI cannot do this over VPN communication,\nthat would cause problems.\n\n501\n00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:43.336\nThat's why it's telling me that I do have\nan Internet connection when technically I\n\n502\n00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:43.960\ndon't.\n\n503\n00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.830\nRemember, we showed you\na using the VPN communication?\n\n504\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:52.998\nI actually just, let me go ahead and\ndisconnect here really quick.\n\n505\n00:25:52.998 --> 00:25:55.240\nDisconnect that, there we go.\n\n506\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.090\nThat should help, and it is disconnected.\n\n507\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.730\nAnd let me make sure that\nI'm on the right adapter.\n\n508\n00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.988\nAgain, gotta be on the right adapter,\nright network for this to work, [LAUGH] or\n\n509\n00:26:05.988 --> 00:26:06.874\nit will not connect.\n\n510\n00:26:06.874 --> 00:26:07.918\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] That's the way.\n\n511\n00:26:07.918 --> 00:26:11.330\n&gt;&gt; Little bit of troubleshooting\nright there on camera.\n\n512\n00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.180\nI wish I could tell you,\nI meant to do that.\n\n513\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n514\n00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:19.874\n&gt;&gt; All right, and you have to be\nable to type MSRA appropriately.\n\n515\n00:26:19.874 --> 00:26:27.240\nSo MSRA, and there we go, there's\nMicrosoft Remote Assistance connection.\n\n516\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.900\nAnd now we're gonna choose, help\nsomebody who has invited you, all right.\n\n517\n00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.100\nNow notice it's telling me\nthat I can use Easy Connect.\n\n518\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.740\nIn this case,\nwe got an invitation file, all right?\n\n519\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.350\nWhen we choose invitation file,\nit's already connected to that location.\n\n520\n00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.040\nI could browse to the location, but since\nI'm already connected directly to it,\n\n521\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.860\nI do see that I have this invitation file.\n\n522\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.936\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna click it.\n\n523\n00:26:49.936 --> 00:26:53.410\nAnd then it should ask me for\nthat password, so I'm gonna go ahead.\n\n524\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:27:00.311\nAnd I'm gonna type this password here,\nthat's what, zb6.\n\n525\n00:27:00.311 --> 00:27:05.946\nThis is gonna be fun,\nsorry guys for this back and\n\n526\n00:27:05.946 --> 00:27:10.354\nforth here, and that is what, lq2.\n\n527\n00:27:10.354 --> 00:27:14.339\nAnd I believe that was zz4tk, and\n\n528\n00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:19.570\nthen what was the last one,\ntkq, all right.\n\n529\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.760\nAnd what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna choose OK.\n\n530\n00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.650\nNow I have to switch back over to my\nWindows 7 machine, because it's asking me,\n\n531\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.988\ndo you want to allow the Administrator\nto connect to your computer?\n\n532\n00:27:29.988 --> 00:27:34.670\nSo remember, I'm making a connection\nto the Windows 7 machine, all right?\n\n533\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:39.281\nSo now it tells me, it says the color\nscheme has changed to Visual Basic.\n\n534\n00:27:39.281 --> 00:27:39.793\nI'm sorry, Visual Basic.\n\n535\n00:27:39.793 --> 00:27:40.423\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Visual Basic.\n\n536\n00:27:40.423 --> 00:27:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Wrong software, and that's because\nI'm on a different connection.\n\n537\n00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:45.774\nit doesn't use the aero theme,\n\n538\n00:27:45.774 --> 00:27:48.633\nbecause it wants to try to give\nyou the best connection quality.\n\n539\n00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:49.805\n&gt;&gt; Experience.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n540\n00:27:49.805 --> 00:27:53.570\nespecially if we're at\na help desk situation.\n\n541\n00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.677\nAnd I want people to be able\nto see what's going on,\n\n542\n00:27:55.677 --> 00:27:59.213\nI don't care about all those flashy little\nimages, I just wanna be able to help them.\n\n543\n00:27:59.213 --> 00:28:01.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, rounded edges aren't really\nhelping me get the problem solved.\n\n544\n00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:03.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's for sure, right?\n\n545\n00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.614\nSo here, notice that this is my screen\non the Windows 8.1 machine, and\n\n546\n00:28:08.614 --> 00:28:11.244\nI do have the ability to request control.\n\n547\n00:28:11.244 --> 00:28:14.461\nYou have to be careful, if you\nare doing this in a lab environment,\n\n548\n00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:18.597\nyou have to remember which screen you're\nlooking at, because if I request control,\n\n549\n00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:20.730\nit shows up what looks like my desktop.\n\n550\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.332\nBut that isn't my desktop,\nwe're sharing control of the desktop.\n\n551\n00:28:24.332 --> 00:28:28.297\nSo I had to flip back over to Windows\n7 machine that we're connected to,\n\n552\n00:28:28.297 --> 00:28:30.860\nand say yes, I'll allow that.\n\n553\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.589\nNow notice what it let's me know.\n\n554\n00:28:32.589 --> 00:28:36.107\nIt says, your helper is sharing\ncontrol over your computer.\n\n555\n00:28:36.107 --> 00:28:39.612\nSo this is our Windows 7 machine, and\nyes, I can move things around, right,\n\n556\n00:28:39.612 --> 00:28:41.790\nI'm sitting in front of this desktop.\n\n557\n00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.660\nBut if Dan was connecting to this and\nhelping, well guess what?\n\n558\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.284\nNow he can move it around too.\n\n559\n00:28:48.284 --> 00:28:52.509\nSo he could say, all right, Wes, I want\nyou to know how to get to Control Panel,\n\n560\n00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:54.795\nand I need you to look\nat Windows Defender.\n\n561\n00:28:54.795 --> 00:28:56.740\nAll right, so he says, push start.\n\n562\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.097\nHe says, go to Control Panel.\n\n563\n00:28:58.097 --> 00:29:00.830\nNow he can do it to if I get lost, right?\n\n564\n00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.729\nAnd then he says,\nI need you to switch the category view.\n\n565\n00:29:02.729 --> 00:29:06.778\nI know this is what you're seeing\nby default, and go to large icons.\n\n566\n00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.737\nBut if I switch back over\nto Windows setting machine,\n\n567\n00:29:09.737 --> 00:29:13.637\nall of these basically happening\nthe same way in real time, see that?\n\n568\n00:29:13.637 --> 00:29:15.844\nAnd then he could say, well,\nscroll down to the bottom and\n\n569\n00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:17.350\nyou'll see Windows Defender.\n\n570\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.380\nSo we're sharing control over the desktop.\n\n571\n00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.175\nAnd that is a great thing to keep in mind,\nall right?\n\n572\n00:29:22.175 --> 00:29:26.184\nAnd I'm going to go ahead,\nand let's close this out.\n\n573\n00:29:26.184 --> 00:29:26.970\nI'll stop sharing.\n\n574\n00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.294\nAnd actually, I wanna go ahead and\n\n575\n00:29:29.294 --> 00:29:34.680\nI wanna just close the Windows Remote\nAssistance now, and do understand that.\n\n576\n00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.560\nAll right, now the last couple of\nthings that I wanna show you, and\n\n577\n00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.620\nI know we're running short on time here,\n\n578\n00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.780\nis a little bit about just\nconfiguring your IP addresses.\n\n579\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.228\nAnd I also wanna show you\nthe network card properties.\n\n580\n00:29:47.228 --> 00:29:49.772\nBut I will tell you Dan,\nit does look like,\n\n581\n00:29:49.772 --> 00:29:52.820\nwe might even have to go into\na part four on this one.\n\n582\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.711\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat might just too big of a bite for\n\n583\n00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:59.414\nus to give within the limited\ntime that we have which is none.\n\n584\n00:29:59.414 --> 00:30:03.611\n[LAUGH] So Wes, I guess we're rolling\ninto that P4, so everybody join us for\n\n585\n00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:04.600\nthat one.\n\n586\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.130\nAs for this episode,\nlooks like we are done, right?\n\n587\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.230\nThanks for watching.\n\n588\n00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.280\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n589\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.963\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n590\n00:30:11.963 --> 00:30:12.555\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.119\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.337\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:17.152\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.001\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.450\nI'm excited to be here today because\nwe are continuing in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.400\nHopefully, you guys are having just\nas much fun as we are teaching it.\n\n10\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510\nAnd joining us in the studio, and when I\nmean we, I mean me and my good friend, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.410\nWes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.550\nWes, we're glad to have you back, man.\n\n13\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.220\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Man, it is going great.\n\n15\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.180\nGood to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.590\nThat is right, we are moving along\nin another one of those mini-series,\n\n17\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.296\nthe series within a series, right?\n\n18\n00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:43.836\n[LAUGH] We've been talking about\nthe Windows client side networking,\n\n19\n00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:46.716\nright, and some of the things\nthat we have to be aware of,\n\n20\n00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:49.070\nand then how we set up\nclient side networking.\n\n21\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.040\nBut it's kind of interesting.\n\n22\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.290\nThat's one thing that we really haven't\ntalked about is actually, well,\n\n23\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.730\nthe client side networking part.\n\n24\n00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.610\nWe've talked about some of\nthe components within it.\n\n25\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.806\nAnd we've talked about about all different\ntopics, but we're really gonna go ahead\n\n26\n00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:04.834\nand what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna look at more of like for\n\n27\n00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.422\ninstance addressing, right?\n\n28\n00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:10.650\nIn the 901 series we really\ntalked about IP addresses.\n\n29\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.680\nWe kinda broke down the networks and\nhow they work.\n\n30\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.360\nBut we didn't really get too much into\n\n31\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800\nactually setting that up\nwithin the operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.440\nSo that's something that\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.500\nwe're gonna look at in this episode.\n\n34\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.738\nWhen it comes down to it,\nyou really have to know.\n\n35\n00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:28.398\nWell, if I am gonna setup some\nkind of network connection,\n\n36\n00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:30.973\nwhere is it that I really do this, right?\n\n37\n00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:33.706\nAnd that's gonna be definitely\ngonna be important for us.\n\n38\n00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:38.418\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nthe first thing we're gonna talk about is,\n\n39\n00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:43.610\nwell, they talk about configuring\nalternative IP addresses in Windows.\n\n40\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.947\nWell, let's talk about IP addresses and\n\n41\n00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:49.505\nthen we'll talk about why we\nmight need an alternative first.\n\n42\n00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:52.261\nSo remember when we talked\nabout about TCP/IP,\n\n43\n00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:56.500\nthe Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\nProtocol Protocol Suite,\n\n44\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.010\nremember that we talked about\nthat we have to have an address.\n\n45\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.680\nWe have to have an IP address to be able\nto send information between source and\n\n46\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.510\ndestination, right?\n\n47\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.060\nThe other thing that we also\nhave to have is a subnet mask.\n\n48\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.820\nRemember that we said that an IP\naddress is actually broken into two\n\n49\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.410\ndifferent parts.\n\n50\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.000\nRemember there's a network portion and\nthere's a node portion.\n\n51\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.300\nThe network portion has to be shared by\nall of the computers on that same network.\n\n52\n00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.680\nAnd then the node portion\nhas to be unique.\n\n53\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.620\nRemember what defines that, that split,\nright, where we define those two portions,\n\n54\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.270\nis with a subnet mask.\n\n55\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.902\nKeep in mind that every computer that's\non the same network has to share\n\n56\n00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.906\na common subnet mask.\n\n57\n00:02:34.906 --> 00:02:37.670\nThe last thing that we also need to keep\nin mind, too, well, a couple of things,\n\n58\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.880\nI guess we can say.\n\n59\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.620\nWe need to keep in mind something\nthat they call out as a gateway.\n\n60\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.740\nNow a gateway can be used generically,\nall right?\n\n61\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.037\nSo let me tell you what I mean when\nI'm talking about TCP/IP settings.\n\n62\n00:02:48.037 --> 00:02:51.360\nWhat we're talking about when we say\ngateway really is something known as\n\n63\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.384\nthe default gateway.\n\n64\n00:02:52.384 --> 00:02:57.570\nI want you to think of it as the doorway\nthat leads off of your network.\n\n65\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.839\nAll right,\nthe gateway is essentially, really,\n\n66\n00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:03.324\njust nothing more than the router that's\nconnected to your local network that\n\n67\n00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:06.733\nallows you to route traffic off of your\nnetwork to a remote network, right?\n\n68\n00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:10.030\nA lot of times, in a home environment,\nthat's gonna be out to the Internet.\n\n69\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.970\nBut keep in mind, you could have a very\nbig routed network within a corporation,\n\n70\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.540\nwhich you have multiple networks and\n\n71\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.470\nyou have these routers that allow\ncomputers to communicate between them.\n\n72\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.670\nSo that's the gateway.\n\n73\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.290\nThat is the IP address, typically,\n\n74\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.990\nof the router that is connected\nto your local network.\n\n75\n00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.230\nBut then you also need things\nlike name resolution, right?\n\n76\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.980\nName resolution happens through DNS,\ndomain name system.\n\n77\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.190\nNow how I'm I going to do name resolution?\n\n78\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.810\nWell, I'm gonna actually have to\ncommunicate with the DNS server.\n\n79\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.650\nI'm gonna have to send traffic,\nor a resolution request,\n\n80\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.130\nif you will, from my local computer,\nthe local DNS service,\n\n81\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.690\nif you will, that's running on my\ncomputer out to the DNS server.\n\n82\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.640\nAnd then it's gonna go through a process\nlike we talked about in other episodes\n\n83\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.330\nof resolving that name to its fully\nqualified domain name of QDN.\n\n84\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.560\nAll right, so where do we see\nthese settings inside of Windows?\n\n85\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.131\nLet's go ahead and dive in.\n\n86\n00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:00.550\nI've got a Windows 8.1 box here.\n\n87\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.900\nMy head's kind of covering this up.\n\n88\n00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.320\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncheat a little bit on this one.\n\n89\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.950\nRemember how to get to Network and\nSharing Center?\n\n90\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.300\nWe've shown you a few different ways.\n\n91\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.780\nRemember, you can always get\nto it right from the desktop,\n\n92\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.070\non the little monitor\nicon in your Taskbar.\n\n93\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.080\nNow once you're here, what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna go from Network and\n\n94\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.010\nSharing Center.\n\n95\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.610\nWe're gonna look at the adapter settings,\nall right?\n\n96\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.930\nWell, I want to talk a little\nbit about the adapter settings.\n\n97\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.920\nNow, I have quite a few\nnetwork adapters here.\n\n98\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.265\nWe set up, in the first part of this,\nwe set up a VPN communication,\n\n99\n00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:28.166\nVPN connection.\n\n100\n00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:29.700\nI'm not worried about that one.\n\n101\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.790\nBut I also have what's known as\na multi-homed computer, right?\n\n102\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.900\nThat means just more\nthan one network adapter.\n\n103\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.350\nI can connect to one network, and\nI can also connect to another network.\n\n104\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.840\nAll right, well, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n105\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.180\nI'm gonna focus on this\nnetwork connection.\n\n106\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.970\nNow I could always rename this by default.\n\n107\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.830\nThis is what it names.\n\n108\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.360\nAnd it names it ethernet zero and\nethernet one, two, three,\n\n109\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.760\nand four if I had to fill up the computer\nwith network adapters, right?\n\n110\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.820\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna right-click, and\n\n111\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.402\nwe're gonna look at some\nright-click options.\n\n112\n00:04:56.402 --> 00:05:00.110\nAll right, now when you choose Disable,\nlike this network adapter over here,\n\n113\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.742\nwhat it does is it turns off the network\nadapter in the operating system.\n\n114\n00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:08.080\nAll right, so your operating system loses\nthe ability to communicate with it.\n\n115\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.040\nBut you also have status, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.050\nAnd if I look at status,\n\n117\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.310\nI can see just some general\nlevel status information, right?\n\n118\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.280\nFor instance, I can see that yes,\nthere is IP connectivity.\n\n119\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.950\nI can see no Internet access with IPv6,\nright?\n\n120\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.120\nWe've talked about those two different\nprotocols in other episodes.\n\n121\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.290\nI can see that the media state, right, is\nenabled, and you can see that right here.\n\n122\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.940\nIt would say disabled,\nkind of like this one does up here.\n\n123\n00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.580\nAnd we could see that fact here.\n\n124\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.320\nI can also see the duration of the uptime.\n\n125\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.450\nYou can see that we've been using this\ncomputer for a little over an hour or\n\n126\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.400\na little under an hour and a half, right?\n\n127\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.150\nSo that shows me the uptime.\n\n128\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.260\nBut it also shows me the speed, all right?\n\n129\n00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.830\nAnd that's one of the things you need to\nunderstand is the network card speed.\n\n130\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.380\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nspeed where you can see additional\n\n131\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.250\nsettings here as well.\n\n132\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.799\nBut the speed typically today\nis gonna be gigabit networks.\n\n133\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.960\nHowever, you do have some other\ntypes of networks as well that we'll\n\n134\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.690\nmention coming up.\n\n135\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.010\nNow we also have the ability to\ndo things like, for instance,\n\n136\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.270\nwe can disable from the status dialog box\njust like we could from the right-click.\n\n137\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.150\nWe can also look at our properties which\nwe're gonna look at the properties coming\n\n138\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.090\nup here in a bit.\n\n139\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.260\nBut then we also can do diagnostic,\nall right?\n\n140\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.540\nOne of the things to keep in mind is\nthat the Windows operating system\n\n141\n00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.110\nhas what's known as a built-in\ndiagnostic troubleshooter, all right?\n\n142\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.350\nThat's part of the network stack in which\nthat it can kinda search for problems,\n\n143\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.810\ngive you some ideas,\nmaybe even automatically fix them.\n\n144\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.290\nSometimes it work, sometimes it doesn't,\ndepends on what the problem is, all right?\n\n145\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.220\nNow we'll talk a little bit more about\nproperties coming up here in a second, but\n\n146\n00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.290\nI do wanna show you the Details button,\nright?\n\n147\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.230\nIf we choose the Details button,\n\n148\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.450\nnow I get a lot of information\nabout the network adapter, right?\n\n149\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.570\nI get things like connection\nspecific DNS suffix.\n\n150\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.490\nDon't worry about that for this exam\nbecause one of the ones that I'm really\n\n151\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.240\nworried about are things\nlike the physical address.\n\n152\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.360\nRemember that's Microsoft,\nthey call it a MAC address,\n\n153\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.110\na physical address, right, the Media\nAccess Control address, that 48 bit,\n\n154\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.730\n6 byte address that we've talked about,\nagain, in other episodes,\n\n155\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.310\nthat uniquely identifies the network\nadapter that's in this machine.\n\n156\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:14.720\nI can see that I'm actually receiving this\naddress through a DHCP lease, if you will.\n\n157\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.459\nIt means my computer called out\nto the network and said, hey,\n\n158\n00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:18.920\nI need an IP address out there.\n\n159\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.040\nAnd there was a DHCP server\nthat was out there listening,\n\n160\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.130\nand gave us this IP address.\n\n161\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.350\nSo here I can see my IPv4 address\nas well as the subnet mask, right?\n\n162\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.150\nAnd I can see right here that I\nhave a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask,\n\n163\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.540\nwhich I know y'all can read out there,\ntoo.\n\n164\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.810\nAll right, I can also say that the lease,\nand when this was obtained, all right, and\n\n165\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.570\nwhen did my computer\nreceive this IP address.\n\n166\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.290\nAnd I can also see when the lease expires.\n\n167\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.384\nAgain, we've talked about\nDHCP in other episodes.\n\n168\n00:07:45.384 --> 00:07:47.500\nSo we're just kind of\nbriefing over this but\n\n169\n00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.226\nnot going too in-depth on it cuz we do\nhave other episodes that we talk about.\n\n170\n00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:54.256\nSo definitely go back and\ncheck out some of those 901 episodes,\n\n171\n00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:56.705\ntoo, because they will\nalso help you here in 902.\n\n172\n00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:01.910\nAll right, I can also see that,\nwell, I don't have a default gateway.\n\n173\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.400\nWhy don't I have a default gateway?\n\n174\n00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.120\nWell, this computer is connected\nto an internal lab environment so\n\n175\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.340\nI don't need to route information\noff of this local network,\n\n176\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.195\nso I don't have a default gateway.\n\n177\n00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:12.940\nThere's no reason to have it, right?\n\n178\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.700\nI can also see what the IP address is of\nthe DHCP server that gave me this address.\n\n179\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.660\nIn this case, remember when we were\nstoring those invitation files and\n\n180\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.430\nwe showed you how to map the drives?\n\n181\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.270\nWell, I've also got that server\nconfigured as a DHCP server.\n\n182\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.310\nSo it's making the offer and\ngiving me these addresses.\n\n183\n00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.950\nAnd it's also providing DNS and it's also\nin some of the options in the background,\n\n184\n00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.790\nI've also got it configured\nto use another DNS server.\n\n185\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.170\nSo I can see a lot of that information.\n\n186\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.740\nI can also see things like our link\nlocal IPv6 address as well, right?\n\n187\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:48.300\nSo I can communicate on my local subnet\nif you will over IPv6 too, all right?\n\n188\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.440\nSo that's the status.\n\n189\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.120\nNow you can also see this information\nfrom the command prompt as well.\n\n190\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.150\nIf I was to right click and\nchoose command prompt, right?\n\n191\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.140\nI can come in here,\n\n192\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.570\nlet me give you a little more\nreal estate here on the screen.\n\n193\n00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.400\nBut I can run something known,\nipconfig, all right, and\n\n194\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.860\nit would show me some of\nthis same information.\n\n195\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.968\nIn fact, let me kinda move this over here,\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n196\n00:09:12.968 --> 00:09:17.040\nAll right, so I can see a lot\nof the same information, right?\n\n197\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.401\nI can see IPv4 address, right?\n\n198\n00:09:18.401 --> 00:09:19.470\nI can see 192.168.0.20.\n\n199\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.960\nSame thing that we see,\nif you will, right here.\n\n200\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.670\nI can also see the subnet mask, as well.\n\n201\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.950\nAnd I can see lack of default gateway,\ntoo.\n\n202\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.140\nNow, I could go a little bit further than\nthis, and if I wanted to find out more\n\n203\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.155\ninformation in the command prompt, I could\ndo an ipconfig and I could do a /all.\n\n204\n00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:41.330\nThat would give me a lot more detail,\na lot more detailed information.\n\n205\n00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.354\nIn fact, when we bring up the status\ndialog box, again, I'll go ahead and\n\n206\n00:09:44.354 --> 00:09:46.770\nmove this to the side, and choose details.\n\n207\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.580\nNotice that now here's where I can\nsee things, like for instance,\n\n208\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.630\nthe DHCP server, DNS server, if you will.\n\n209\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.690\nSame information that we're\nfinding over here, likewise.\n\n210\n00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.643\nIf I scroll up I can also see things like\nthe physical address, or the MAC address,\n\n211\n00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:03.680\nright, and that's the same thing that we\ncan see in the graphical user interface.\n\n212\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.300\nOne's through the command line,\nthe command line interpreter,\n\n213\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.040\nversus what you're seeing here\nin a graphical user interface.\n\n214\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.820\nNow that's where I find this information,\nright?\n\n215\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.540\nNow how will I configure this?\n\n216\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.240\nWell, there's a couple different\nways that you could do this.\n\n217\n00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.580\nOne of the ways that we showed you can do\nthis is by just choosing properties here\n\n218\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.670\nin [INAUDIBLE] dialog box.\n\n219\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.160\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna close this down.\n\n220\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.700\nAnd I'll also close down\nour command prompt as well.\n\n221\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.800\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on\nthe network adapter, too,\n\n222\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.450\nbecause you'll see this given out a lot\nas, piece of advice on how to do this.\n\n223\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.970\nI right click on the network\nadapter that I wanna configure, and\n\n224\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.050\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna choose properties.\n\n225\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.335\nWhen we choose properties here, I now have\nthe properties of the network adapter,\n\n226\n00:10:42.335 --> 00:10:43.500\nalright.\n\n227\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.810\nNow understand that when we talk\nabout configuration, notice\n\n228\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.090\nthat we have all these check marks, and\nwe have all this information in here and\n\n229\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.390\nyou can see things like\nInternet Protocol Version 4.\n\n230\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.580\nYou could also see things like\nInternet Protocol Version 6 as well.\n\n231\n00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.150\nWell, these are what are known as\nprotocol bindings and not to get\n\n232\n00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:06.070\ntoo technical guys on you when we say\nprotocol binding what does that mean?\n\n233\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.360\nWell, it means that your network adapter\nknows how to speak that protocol,\n\n234\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.860\nknows how to speak that language.\n\n235\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.750\nThat's really all it means, right?\n\n236\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.480\nAnd if we say bound to\nthe network adapter,\n\n237\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.580\nwe're just saying hey you've\nbasically taught that network adapter\n\n238\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.170\nthrough configuration how\nto speak that language.\n\n239\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:26.020\nNow if we select for this case, we're just\ngonna focus on Internet Protocol Version 4\n\n240\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:31.720\nor IPv4 as it's commonly abbreviated and\nwe're gonna choose the properties option.\n\n241\n00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.640\nNow when we choose the properties option,\nright, you notice they said,\n\n242\n00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.965\nthe objective says configuring\nan alternative IP address in Windows.\n\n243\n00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.581\nWell-\n&gt;&gt; Alternative to what?\n\n244\n00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:42.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, that's exactly why.\n\n245\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.570\nThat's what got me.\n\n246\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.130\nI'm like well hey, how about we figure\nout what our normal IP address is and\n\n247\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.706\nthen we can show you why you\nwould need an alternative, right?\n\n248\n00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:51.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; An alternative to\n\n249\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.860\nour normal IP address, right?\n\n250\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.890\nSo here's where it might\nget confusing on the exam.\n\n251\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.340\nNotice it says obtain an IP\naddress automatically.\n\n252\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.150\nI really don't like the verbage\non this cuz it's confusing for\n\n253\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.990\nsome students, right?\n\n254\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.450\nThere's nothing really automatic.\n\n255\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.950\nIt might be automatic to the client side,\nbut an administrator, at some point,\n\n256\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.310\nhad to set this up on the server side.\n\n257\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.417\nAll right, because we technically do have\nan address which is the alternative that\n\n258\n00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:20.230\nhappens automatically, through what\nis known as a zero config technology,\n\n259\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.040\nzero configuration.\n\n260\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.655\nSo this, I want you to understand,\nis DHCP.\n\n261\n00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:28.920\nAll right, if you say if Dan\nwas to call me and say, hey,\n\n262\n00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.010\nWes, I have a manual configuration\nthat I don't want there anymore,\n\n263\n00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.670\nI need you to switch this\nmachine over to DHCP.\n\n264\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.430\nI would come in to the properties\nof the network adapter and\n\n265\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.520\nI would switch this from\nuse the following, and\n\n266\n00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.270\nI'll show you what I mean here in\na second, to obtain automatically.\n\n267\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.041\nAnd that's how we know DHCP is enabled.\n\n268\n00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:48.465\nNow, what if Dan says,\n\n269\n00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:53.386\nyou know what, I've actually turned off\nthe configuration to the access point or\n\n270\n00:12:53.386 --> 00:12:58.111\nthe router, and I've reconfigured what\nprivate IP addresses we're using.\n\n271\n00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:02.821\nSo we're no longer using the ones in DHCP,\nand until I get the DHCP server back on,\n\n272\n00:13:02.821 --> 00:13:06.940\nI need this computer to have\na statically assigned IP address, right?\n\n273\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.500\nWe talked about the difference\nbetween static and dynamic, right?\n\n274\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.360\nStatic is just a manual configuration,\nright?\n\n275\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.460\nAnd if I wanna do that then I have to tell\nthe network adapter you will use this IP\n\n276\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.130\naddress, not call out to the network and\nask for one.\n\n277\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.560\nYou will use this one.\n\n278\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.700\nAnd this is where we could do\nsomething like 192.168.0 and\n\n279\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:32.460\nI might just do 101 cuz I know\nthat is not under my DHCP scope.\n\n280\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.570\nAll right and then I have to make sure\nthat it has the right IP address and\n\n281\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:41.130\nnow you can configure these to\nwhatever valid subnet mask you want.\n\n282\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.790\nHowever, keep in mind on this\nnetwork to be considered\n\n283\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.410\nto be on the same network\nas these other computers,\n\n284\n00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.270\nI have to have the same subnet mask that\nall the other computers have alright.\n\n285\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.360\nAnd yes,\nI could put a default gateway in here.\n\n286\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.800\nI will tell you I don't have a router.\n\n287\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.621\n&gt;&gt; You're not connected to the internet.\n\n288\n00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:02.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm not connected to the internet,\nso it doesn't really matter.\n\n289\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.540\nBut I'll show you,\nif you were connected to the internet,\n\n290\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.660\nyou might have something like this, right,\nthis is a commonality in home networks,\n\n291\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.530\nwhere it's the very first address\nwithin that IP range, right?\n\n292\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:19.410\nYou might see 192.168.0.1 or you might see\n192.168.1.1, that's a common one as well.\n\n293\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.440\nNow, I can also manually\nconfigure the DNS server.\n\n294\n00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.340\nNow, a lot of times when you do this\non home networks, what you're gonna do,\n\n295\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:34.120\nis you're gonna do typically\nthe same thing as your router.\n\n296\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.169\nYou're gonna do 192.\n\n297\n00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:39.227\nSo if my default gateway or your default\ngateway, if my default gateway is\n\n298\n00:14:39.227 --> 00:14:43.746\n196.168.0.1 and then on home network\nI'm typically gonna do the same\n\n299\n00:14:43.746 --> 00:14:48.020\nthing because what you are telling\nthe router is yeah here's my DNS request.\n\n300\n00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.540\nA lot of times your home routers they\njust kind of go that's a DNS request.\n\n301\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.600\nWell, I'm not really doing anything,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n302\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.540\njust pass that over to ISP and the ISP's\nDNS server will resolve it for you.\n\n303\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.590\nAll right, so this is how I would\nset up a static assignment.\n\n304\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.525\nAll right and then once that's done, I can\nchoose okay, and I can choose close, and\n\n305\n00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:09.380\nit'll go through the process of\nmaking sure that it's configured.\n\n306\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.560\nNow, I can always turn around, and\nI can choose status, after the fact, and\n\n307\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.550\nI can choose details.\n\n308\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.910\nAnd now we can see,\nnotice that it says DHCP Enabled,\n\n309\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.870\nno because I didn't do this automatically,\nright?\n\n310\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.440\nIt's no longer dynamic,\nit is a static assignment.\n\n311\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.508\nAll right and then we could use\nthings like your ping utility,\n\n312\n00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:29.105\nwhich we'll show you in\ntroubleshooting section,\n\n313\n00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:32.130\non how to test whether this\nconnection is valid and working.\n\n314\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.061\nAll right, so\nthat is a little bit about how you would\n\n315\n00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:38.396\nconfigure things like your IP address,\nyour subnet mask,\n\n316\n00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:43.420\nyour DNS server settings as well as\nyour gateway or your default gateway.\n\n317\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.998\nNow, some of the other things that they\ncall out are the network card properties.\n\n318\n00:15:45.998 --> 00:15:49.191\nAnd I kinda mentioned one of them\nwithout actually going into it too much.\n\n319\n00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:53.756\nIf I go back to our properties of a\nnetwork adapter here and I right click and\n\n320\n00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:58.857\nI choose status You'll notice one of the\nthings that it said was speed 1 gigabit.\n\n321\n00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:05.628\nOr 1000 megabits, if you will,\ndepending on what your reference point is.\n\n322\n00:16:05.628 --> 00:16:07.498\nI didn't set this.\n\n323\n00:16:07.498 --> 00:16:11.200\nAnd so\nwhere is it getting this information?\n\n324\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.186\nI didn't set anything.\n\n325\n00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:15.704\nWell, today, a lot of times,\nyou don't have to set this speed settings.\n\n326\n00:16:15.704 --> 00:16:18.180\nThey're auto negotiated.\n\n327\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.970\nWhat happens is when you connect\nto a switch, you connect to\n\n328\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.095\na connectivity device, your operating\nsystem reaches out to that device.\n\n329\n00:16:25.095 --> 00:16:27.345\nAnd it says, hey,\nhere's my MAC address so you can find me.\n\n330\n00:16:27.345 --> 00:16:31.112\nAnd the switch says, yeah,\nokay, I see your MAC address.\n\n331\n00:16:31.112 --> 00:16:34.190\nBy the way,\nthis is what the network is running at.\n\n332\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.060\nThis is the configuration that we have.\n\n333\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.550\nAnd the adapter says, okay.\n\n334\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.820\nThe driver, if you will, technically to\nthe network adapter through the operating\n\n335\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.250\nsystem says, okay,\nlet me configure that automatically.\n\n336\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.650\nSo where would I see that information?\n\n337\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.398\nWell, you can actually\nset your speed settings.\n\n338\n00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:52.070\nLet me go ahead and\njust close this down here.\n\n339\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.205\nAnd I'm gonna go to Computer Management.\n\n340\n00:16:54.205 --> 00:16:56.800\nRight-click on the Windows tile.\n\n341\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.300\nWe'll go ahead, well, there's a couple\nof different ways I could do this.\n\n342\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.600\nI could actually go to Computer Management\nand launch Device Manager.\n\n343\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.431\nBut in Windows 8.1 here,\n\n344\n00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:07.520\nyou do have that right on\nthe administrative quick links here.\n\n345\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.475\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust go to Computer Management.\n\n346\n00:17:09.475 --> 00:17:12.730\nCuz that's consistent across\nall the operating systems.\n\n347\n00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.390\nDevice Manager being there at the top.\n\n348\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.187\nThat's really just\nsomething that's unique,\n\n349\n00:17:17.187 --> 00:17:20.160\nexam alert, [LAUGH] to Windows 8.1.\n\n350\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.090\nSo then I could go to Device Manager here.\n\n351\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.624\nAnd what we could is we could look for,\nwell, it's kind of neat.\n\n352\n00:17:27.624 --> 00:17:29.060\nIt's already expanded out for us.\n\n353\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.830\nNotice I have network adapters.\n\n354\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.060\nAnd I could look for\nthe appropriate network adapter.\n\n355\n00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.339\nI could right-click on it and\nI could choose Properties.\n\n356\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.717\nNow when you look at the properties,\n\n357\n00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:41.658\nyou can go to what's known as\nthe Advanced tab, all right?\n\n358\n00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:43.085\nAnd the Advanced tab,\n\n359\n00:17:43.085 --> 00:17:47.302\nI'm not sure that they're gonna\nreally call this out on the exam.\n\n360\n00:17:47.302 --> 00:17:49.147\nBut just in case they do,\nyou'll know where it is.\n\n361\n00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:54.510\nAnd if I scroll down, you'll see that\nthere's a term called Speed &amp; Duplex.\n\n362\n00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.660\nWe'll get into duplex\nhere in just a second.\n\n363\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.990\nIf I look at Speed,\nnotice the value there, Dan.\n\n364\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.200\nNotice it says, well,\nit's auto negotiated.\n\n365\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.543\nSo this is why we didn't have to set this.\n\n366\n00:18:02.543 --> 00:18:04.640\nAnd a lot of times, we don't set this.\n\n367\n00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.270\nBut I do have some options,\nif I want, when it comes to speed.\n\n368\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.857\nAnd I'm gonna talk about\nduplex here in a second.\n\n369\n00:18:10.857 --> 00:18:12.852\nBut let's just talk about\nsome of the speeds.\n\n370\n00:18:12.852 --> 00:18:18.280\n10 gigabit, or excuse me, not 10 gigabit\nbut 10 megabits, this is an old network.\n\n371\n00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.960\nThis is the ethernet-based standard.\n\n372\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.270\nIt's been around for a very long time.\n\n373\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.470\nIt's largely obsolete today\nas far as in your networks.\n\n374\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.124\nHowever, most of your network adapters\nlike you can see here, they call them 10,\n\n375\n00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:32.650\n100 and 1000 megabit adapters\nbecause they support ethernet.\n\n376\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.790\nThey also support 100 megabits, which is\nfast ethernet, which is still common.\n\n377\n00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.685\nYou can still find that out there.\n\n378\n00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:39.211\nAnd in fact, a lot of times,\n\n379\n00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:43.130\nyour networks will run at 100 megabits\neven though they say gigabit.\n\n380\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.220\nA lot of times,\nyou don't get the full gigabit speeds.\n\n381\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.330\nJust cuz there's a lot of contributing\nfactors that can hinder the performance of\n\n382\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.430\nthe network.\n\n383\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.820\nAnd then you also have gigabit speeds.\n\n384\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.155\nA lot of times,\nwe just do auto negotiation.\n\n385\n00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:57.885\nSo what do these other settings mean.\n\n386\n00:18:57.885 --> 00:18:59.990\nThey also talk about duplex.\n\n387\n00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.735\nWe have what's known as half duplex and\nwe have what's known as full duplex.\n\n388\n00:19:03.735 --> 00:19:06.245\nWell, let me bump over\nto a slide that I got so\n\n389\n00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.675\nyou guys can see what\na duplex setting means.\n\n390\n00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:15.195\nNotice that with duplex, we talk about the\nability to send and receive information.\n\n391\n00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:20.834\nAnd it really boils down to, can we send\nand receive information at the same time.\n\n392\n00:19:20.834 --> 00:19:24.300\nSo remember that like we've talked\nabout in the hardware side,\n\n393\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.090\nwe talked a little bit about\nthe wiring of your network adapter.\n\n394\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.363\nWe said we have two pins that\nactually send information.\n\n395\n00:19:30.363 --> 00:19:32.440\nWe've got two pins that actually receive.\n\n396\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:38.324\nWell, if you are in a half duplex\nsituation, that means you send or\n\n397\n00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:43.970\nyou receive, but\nyou don't do both at the same time.\n\n398\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.560\nThat means if we're in a half\nduplex communication and\n\n399\n00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.590\nI'm sending information to Dan.\n\n400\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.360\nDan's got no alternative but to wait\nbefore he can send information back to me.\n\n401\n00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.170\nCuz he can send or he can receive.\n\n402\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.750\nIf I'm sending him information, that means\nhe's receiving it, he cannot send it back.\n\n403\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.622\nMost of our networks don't operate\nin single duplex or half duplex,\n\n404\n00:20:03.622 --> 00:20:04.472\nexcuse me, today.\n\n405\n00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:12.040\nWhat they operate in is full duplex,\nwhich is send and receive simultaneously.\n\n406\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.382\nNow, again, most of these\nare going to be auto negotiated in\n\n407\n00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.692\nthe majority of your networks.\n\n408\n00:20:18.692 --> 00:20:21.467\nAnd if you're in a gigabit network,\nyou have to run full duplex.\n\n409\n00:20:21.467 --> 00:20:23.987\nThere's no such thing as\na half duplex gigabit network.\n\n410\n00:20:23.987 --> 00:20:27.646\nThe standard requires full\nduplex communications.\n\n411\n00:20:27.646 --> 00:20:30.919\nAnd with that being the commonality\nof your networking today,\n\n412\n00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:35.060\nthat's why we're typically\noperating in full duplex today.\n\n413\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.660\nHalf duplex is gone by the wayside.\n\n414\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.571\nNow, the other thing that they will call\nout, they not only call out speeds and\n\n415\n00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:45.328\nduplex settings, they also call out\nwhat's known as quality of service.\n\n416\n00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:49.720\nNow, quality of service essentially\nis a way to prioritize traffic\n\n417\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.050\nwithin your networks to\ndefine what types of traffic.\n\n418\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.290\nLike, for instance,\nyour online gaming systems.\n\n419\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.520\nI want all of my network bandwidth\nto go to the gaming system so\n\n420\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.600\nI get the best performance.\n\n421\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.320\nOr I want all of the web servers'\ntraffic to be prioritized so\n\n422\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.580\nI got a better web experience.\n\n423\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.380\nWell, that's something that\nyou set on the access point.\n\n424\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.078\nBut you also have inside of\nWindows if I drop down to.\n\n425\n00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:17.246\nAnd I'll show you on a Windows 7 machine\nso we're showing you both things.\n\n426\n00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:19.279\nI could drop down at\nthe Start button here.\n\n427\n00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.570\nI can go to Control Panel.\n\n428\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.640\nI change this back to category view\njust for the purposes of teaching.\n\n429\n00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.620\nI can go to Network and Internet.\n\n430\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.070\nAnd again, Network and Sharing Center.\n\n431\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.680\nIt's interesting cuz\nwe're going right back\n\n432\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.212\nto the properties of the network adapter.\n\n433\n00:21:32.212 --> 00:21:34.470\nI can go to Change adapter settings.\n\n434\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.198\nAnd then I right-click on whatever\nthe connection is that we're choosing.\n\n435\n00:21:38.198 --> 00:21:40.540\nIn this case, it's Local Area Connection.\n\n436\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.660\nI can choose Properties.\n\n437\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.260\nAnd in here, notice that we talked about\nthe protocols and technologies that\n\n438\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.660\nare bound to the network, teaches\nthe network adapter how to do something.\n\n439\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.000\nWell, notice what's right there.\n\n440\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.910\nQoS Packet Scheduler,\nright there at the top.\n\n441\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.100\nAnd if I select that, and\nwe come down here, it'll tell you.\n\n442\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.180\nIt says,\nQuality of Service Packet Scheduler.\n\n443\n00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.190\nWhat this does is this is a component\nthat provides network traffic control,\n\n444\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:12.400\nincluding rate-of-flow and, I can't\neven say that, prioritization services.\n\n445\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.180\nIt prioritizes which traffic\ngets what resources.\n\n446\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.600\nSo that's a great thing to have.\n\n447\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.046\nAnother thing that they call out\nis something known as Wake-on-LAN.\n\n448\n00:22:23.046 --> 00:22:26.689\nWake-on-LAN or the WoL packets,\nthis is essentially a way to,\n\n449\n00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:29.404\nif the network adapter is\nin a low powered state or\n\n450\n00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:34.290\nthe operating system is in a hibernation\nor a sleep state, you can wake it up.\n\n451\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.730\nMost of them today actually,\n\n452\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.340\nif it's in a powered off state,\nthe computer can be completely turned off.\n\n453\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:45.780\nAnd if you configure it right and you send\nthe Wake-on-LAN package over the network,\n\n454\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.410\nyou can actually wake it up from\na low powered or powered off state.\n\n455\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.570\nNow, this network adapter\ndoesn't support it, but\n\n456\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.080\nI can show you where you\nwould configure that.\n\n457\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.562\nIf we go back to our Start button,\nwe go to Control Panel.\n\n458\n00:22:58.562 --> 00:23:04.170\nWe go to System and\nSecurity &gt; Administrative Tools.\n\n459\n00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:08.372\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nlaunch up Computer Management just so\n\n460\n00:23:08.372 --> 00:23:10.325\nI can show you Device Manager again.\n\n461\n00:23:10.325 --> 00:23:16.190\nAnd inside the Device Manager, when I\nget there, we have Network adapters.\n\n462\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.739\nAnd what you can do is you can select\nthe appropriate network adapter.\n\n463\n00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:21.503\nYou can right-click and choose Properties.\n\n464\n00:23:21.503 --> 00:23:24.710\nAnd under Power Management, it says,\n\n465\n00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.405\nallow the computer to turn\nthis device off to save power.\n\n466\n00:23:29.405 --> 00:23:32.315\nBut notice it says,\nallow this device to wake the computer.\n\n467\n00:23:32.315 --> 00:23:35.319\nNow, again,\nthis virtual machine doesn't support that.\n\n468\n00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:36.835\nAnd that's why it's grayed out.\n\n469\n00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:39.265\nYour physical machines and\neven your laptops do support it.\n\n470\n00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:41.477\nAnd then you just come in here and\nyou click that.\n\n471\n00:23:41.477 --> 00:23:45.241\nAnd that would allow you from\nan access point or a network switch to\n\n472\n00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:49.494\nsend the Wake-on-LAN package over\nthe network and wake this device up.\n\n473\n00:23:49.494 --> 00:23:52.061\nAnd that's perfect for\nthings like remote administration.\n\n474\n00:23:52.061 --> 00:23:56.062\nAll right, Dan one last thing\nthat I just want to mention here,\n\n475\n00:23:56.062 --> 00:23:59.701\nwe've already pretty much\ntalked about this in 901.\n\n476\n00:23:59.701 --> 00:24:03.382\nWe talked about BIOS and\nsome of the BIOS configurations and\n\n477\n00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:05.280\nsettings that you can do.\n\n478\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.930\nInside of your BIOS,\n\n479\n00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:12.790\nyou have what's known as the ability\nto turn on an onboard network adapter.\n\n480\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.360\nWe've talked about this extensively,\ntalking about motherboard functionality,\n\n481\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.690\nthe chip set functionality and the fact\nthat the chip set can perform the same\n\n482\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.690\nthing that a network adapter does, it's\nessentially an integrated network adapter.\n\n483\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:29.220\nIn order for that to function, you have\nto go into your BIOS settings, and\n\n484\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.753\nyou enable it.\n\n485\n00:24:29.753 --> 00:24:31.125\nIt's usually just a check mark, right?\n\n486\n00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:34.953\nIt's just a setting that you turn off, you\nsave the settings, you reboot the machine\n\n487\n00:24:34.953 --> 00:24:38.674\nand then the integrated or on board NIC,\nas they call it the network interface car,\n\n488\n00:24:38.674 --> 00:24:42.055\nnow allows the motherboard to control\nall of the network communications.\n\n489\n00:24:42.055 --> 00:24:45.348\nAnd it isn't something that\nis put in an expansion slot,\n\n490\n00:24:45.348 --> 00:24:47.720\nlike your other network adapters are.\n\n491\n00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.500\nKeep in mind that inside of the operating\nsystem, though, a network adapter's\n\n492\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.180\na network adapter, and it looks no\ndifferent, whether it's onboard or\n\n493\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.980\nit happens to be a network adapter card\nthat is put into an expansion slot.\n\n494\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.560\nIt's still gonna look the same,\nstill gonna be configured the same,\n\n495\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.660\nhowever, to configure at the hardware\nlevel you gotta boot into your BIOS or\n\n496\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.780\nUEFI if that's what you end up having,\nand you enable it.\n\n497\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.840\nKeep in mind that sometimes\nthey don't play nice together.\n\n498\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.280\nSo if you have an onboard network adapter,\nand you have one that is installed in\n\n499\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.680\nan expansion slot, sometimes you have\nto disable one over the other, right?\n\n500\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.530\nSo just pay attention to that, because\nif you have both of them enabled and\n\n501\n00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.270\nthey don't play nice, sometimes\nthe operating system doesn't like it.\n\n502\n00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:33.100\nAnd both of them will fail to work,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n503\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.790\nAnd then I think as far as\nthe network card properties go,\n\n504\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.210\nI think we've got everything.\n\n505\n00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.895\nKeep in mind where some\nof these settings are.\n\n506\n00:25:39.895 --> 00:25:44.088\nI know we've been into a few parts here,\nbut remember, if you're just starting out\n\n507\n00:25:44.088 --> 00:25:47.927\nin A+, client network side of things\nis gonna be very, very important, and\n\n508\n00:25:47.927 --> 00:25:51.200\nit is something that you absolutely\nwill wanna be familiar with.\n\n509\n00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.470\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, you did a fantastic job of\nwalking us through the myriad of different\n\n510\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.180\nthings that we would have to know about\nnetworking in our client computers that we\n\n511\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.960\ncan make sure that the connections are\nestablished and that if we need to maybe\n\n512\n00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.905\ndo a little troubleshooting and\nlittle odds and ins, and knobs and\n\n513\n00:26:05.905 --> 00:26:09.976\ntwisties that we could do to tweak it and\nmake it perform just like we like.\n\n514\n00:26:09.976 --> 00:26:15.540\nNow Wes, we covered a bevy of topics\non that so definitely, go back over,\n\n515\n00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.800\nwatch this little bit of series that we\nhave inside of A+ here, because this is\n\n516\n00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.880\ngoing to help you out a lot when it comes\nto your career as an IT technician.\n\n517\n00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.440\nThat being said, Wes,\nI'm looking at the clock, and\n\n518\n00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.010\nit looks like we have come right to\nthe end of our time here for this episode.\n\n519\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.050\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n520\n00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.200\nBut signing off for ITPRO.TV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n521\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.273\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n522\n00:26:38.273 --> 00:26:44.407\n[MUSIC]\n\n523\n00:26:44.407 -->

[SOUND]\n\n3\n00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:08.268\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:12.410\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.030\n&gt;&gt; Alright,\n\n6\n00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.920\ngreetings everyone and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.448\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well you guys have\n\n8\n00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:24.200\ncome to the right spot because we\nare dishing out more of our A plus series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.100\nI've been enjoying it very much so\nfar, hopefully you have as well.\n\n10\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.040\nBecause joining us back in\nthe studio again today to help\n\n11\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.420\nlend his expertise to this topic,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.820\nWes, how's it going man?\n\n13\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.780\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.610\nGreat to be back here.\n\n15\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.210\nThat's right, continuing on and\nwe've really, over the last few episodes,\n\n16\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.200\nbeen in our first domain.\n\n17\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.600\nThe first domain being\nthe Windows Operating System.\n\n18\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020\nAnd well, we're gonna continue along here\nwith the Windows Operating System but\n\n19\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.960\none of the things that when we talk about,\nwhat's the title, right?\n\n20\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.280\nPreventive maintenance.\n\n21\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.930\nNow I'm gonna use this\nterm interchangeably.\n\n22\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.825\nIn fact Dan and I were talking,\nour director out there, we were talking.\n\n23\n00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; About it before we even started,\n\n24\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.310\nthat you're gonna hear me say,\npreventative maintenance as well, right?\n\n25\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.480\nSo understand that the formal objectives\nthat were looking at right now 1.7 perform\n\n26\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.970\ncommon preventive maintenance procedure\nusing the appropriate Windows OS tools.\n\n27\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.160\nHowever, again I'm going\nto say preventative, right?\n\n28\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.275\nSo either or\nunderstand that it's not a semantic.\n\n29\n00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:20.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That you\n\n30\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.905\nhave to worry about on the exam\nbecause you do get the point.\n\n31\n00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:23.910\nRemember.\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be fun,\n\n32\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.996\nthey give you the question,\nis it preventative or preventive?\n\n33\n00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right, and\n\n34\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.390\nI always tell people if you\nunderstand what's going on and\n\n35\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.815\nsomebody points to the moon.\n\n36\n00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:34.115\nDon't critique the finger that's pointing,\n\n37\n00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.125\npay attention to what\nthey're talking about, right?\n\n38\n00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.095\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good point Wes.\n\n39\n00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:38.625\n&gt;&gt; We do have to keep that in mind.\n\n40\n00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:42.275\nNow, and one of the things I also want\nto preface this with is even though\n\n41\n00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:46.187\nwe're talking about Windows OS,\nthis goes for any operating system.\n\n42\n00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:49.517\nIn fact, we're gonna be looking heavily at\nWindows, but let's go ahead take a look at\n\n43\n00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:53.097\nmy screen real quick and let me show you\nwhat's going on behind the scenes, right.\n\n44\n00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:54.947\nI actually have my Mac going on,\n\n45\n00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:58.078\nmy Mac that we're running where we're\nrunning our virtual machines on that.\n\n46\n00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:01.381\nWell, I was kind of telling Dan in\nthe background, I'm actually doing\n\n47\n00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:04.962\npreventative maintenance as we speak\nright here because it's important for\n\n48\n00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:08.815\nme to make sure, and Dan as well, and all\nthe other hosts and subject matter experts\n\n49\n00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:12.428\nthat we have here, that our systems\nare up and running for our shows, right?\n\n50\n00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:16.193\nWe want to bring you that great content,\nwe want to bring you these great shows, so\n\n51\n00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:19.372\nwe can impart the education to you and\nimpart the information to you.\n\n52\n00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:23.910\nBut if my laptop fails, well I'm going to\nfail to be able to impart anything, right?\n\n53\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.532\nSo I want you to.\n\n54\n00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:25.365\n&gt;&gt; You're a failure Wesley.\n\n55\n00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:26.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthat's right, a big failure.\n\n56\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n57\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.840\nwe have to make sure that\nwe're doing this, and\n\n58\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.690\nit doesn't matter what\noperating system we're in.\n\n59\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.170\nSo I do want to just let you know that\nyeah we'll be talking about Windows,\n\n60\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.650\nbut this is what we.\n\n61\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.220\nIf were verbally saying,\nwe practice what we preach.\n\n62\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.830\nWe have to back up our system.\n\n63\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.362\nSo I'm actually doing this live,\nright now.\n\n64\n00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:45.915\nLive through recorded TV, right?\n\n65\n00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:46.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm actually doing this in\n\n66\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.670\nthe background right now.\n\n67\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.110\nSo just wanna to throw that out there as\na side note even though we're gonna be in\n\n68\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.160\nour Windows Operating Systems\nin this episode.\n\n69\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.740\nSo one of the first things they talk\nabout are scheduled backups, all right?\n\n70\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.670\nNow what do we mean when we\ntalk about scheduled backups?\n\n71\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.750\nWell first of all we're talking\nabout a way to make sure,\n\n72\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.980\nensure, that when we set a backup we\ncan walk away from the machine and\n\n73\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.410\nthen at a certain time\nit's gonna run a backup.\n\n74\n00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.900\nIt's gonna run,\nbasically it's gonna take copies, right?\n\n75\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.090\nLet's start very basically.\n\n76\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.320\nWhat is a backup to begin with, right?\n\n77\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.870\nWell I have a couple different types of\nfiles that we always wanna make sure that\n\n78\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.260\nwe have access to, all right?\n\n79\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.430\nSome are more important than others,\ndepends on how,\n\n80\n00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.200\nwhat your perspective is, right?\n\n81\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.250\nAnd what I mean by that is, well,\nthe operating system has crucial files\n\n82\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.710\nthat are important for the operating\nsystem to even function, right?\n\n83\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.400\nBut then you also have user files, right?\n\n84\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.870\nWe've talked about user profiles.\n\n85\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.560\nIn fact, let me show you our\nWindows 8.1 machine here.\n\n86\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.980\nIf I drop down to my file explorer,\nwe'll dig down in local disk C, and\n\n87\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.940\nwe'll get into users.\n\n88\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.630\nRemember, we talked about\nthe user profile a little bit.\n\n89\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.030\nIn past episodes, right?\n\n90\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.620\nAnd the user profile is just that\ncollection of directories, folders,\n\n91\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.470\nif you will, in the GUI,\ndirectories inside of your command prompt.\n\n92\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.670\nWhere we store information,\nthat is specific to each user, right?\n\n93\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.350\nAnd every user, has a user profile\nwhere they have a collection of\n\n94\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.340\nfolders than they store their information.\n\n95\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.840\nNow for your end users this information\nis very very important, right?\n\n96\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.030\nWe have to make sure that if we're\nusing things like line of business\n\n97\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.270\napplications, right?\n\n98\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.850\nThat we have that company\ndata that is saved.\n\n99\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.052\nWell, it is no different than if you're\nsaving this information in a network share\n\n100\n00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:31.848\nlike we've shown you in past episodes,\nmapping network drives, right?\n\n101\n00:04:31.848 --> 00:04:33.508\nWe still have to go to that computer,\n\n102\n00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:36.517\nit might just be a server that\nwe're saving information on right?\n\n103\n00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:39.130\nAnd we still have to\nback up that user data.\n\n104\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.840\nBut if I dig down in here to local\ndisk C understand that i've also got\n\n105\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.100\nWindows files that are very,\nvery important right?\n\n106\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.777\nThe operating system files that we need to\njust have this operating system running.\n\n107\n00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:53.430\nNow the reason I said that it\ndepends on what your perspective is,\n\n108\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.610\nis which one is more important\nthan the other, right?\n\n109\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.050\nWhy do I say that?\n\n110\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.660\nWell, when we look at client operating\nsystems today, they make it very,\n\n111\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.250\nvery easy to recover from operating\nsystem failures for us today.\n\n112\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.010\nWe've got a lot of utilities that\nwe've talked about in past episodes;\n\n113\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.440\nthings like system restore, right?\n\n114\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.050\nWhere we can restore the configuration\nto an earlier point in time.\n\n115\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.770\nShould we happen to have some\nkind of error if you will or\n\n116\n00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.460\ndriver causes a problem.\n\n117\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.580\nWe can do complete system restores, right?\n\n118\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.161\nI can go if I wanted to do recovery,\nright?\n\n119\n00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:26.430\nI could jump down to our charms menu\nhere go into PC settings, right?\n\n120\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.790\nAnd then over here we have what's\nknown as update and recovery, right?\n\n121\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.122\nAnd when we talk about update and\nrecovery, right?\n\n122\n00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:39.220\nWe have to understand that I could\ndo a complete refresh the PC, right?\n\n123\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.040\nSo it says if your PC isn't running well,\nyou can refresh it without losing your\n\n124\n00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.800\nphotos, music, video and\nother personal files, right?\n\n125\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.020\nIn a home environment, right?\n\n126\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.380\nThis might be a little bit more\nimportant to you because it´s not so\n\n127\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.140\neasy to just rush out and\ngrab a new operating system, right?\n\n128\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.080\nSo your system files and then,\nobviously, your photos and\n\n129\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.300\nyour music that's going to be very,\nvery important to you.\n\n130\n00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.960\nHowever in a corporate environment,\na lot of times, and Dan I think you've\n\n131\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.960\nmentioned this and I've mentioned this in\npast episodes, if something gets hosed\n\n132\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.995\nup with the operating system and\nwe can't solve it within a few minutes.\n\n133\n00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.153\nIt's not convenient, and\n\n134\n00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:14.720\nI think you said money isn't\nreally conducive to the time and\n\n135\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.111\nrelative to the money that they would pay\nyou to try to fix the operating system.\n\n136\n00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.064\nWhat'd you guys usually do?\n\n137\n00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:22.826\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it got to be where it was just\ntaking too much time, we would just say,\n\n138\n00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:23.567\nyou know what,\n\n139\n00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:27.445\nwe've got a nice little room right over\nhere where there's a guy in here creating\n\n140\n00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:30.835\nnew computers with fresh installs\nthat should work just fine for you.\n\n141\n00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:32.290\nI'm going to send you one of those.\n\n142\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.240\nYou show me that hunk of crap you\ngot right there back [LAUGH].\n\n143\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.830\nAnd you know what we'll do with it?\n\n144\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.550\nWe'll reimage it and\n\n145\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.280\nwe'll send that to somebody else because\nit will be just like it was brand new.\n\n146\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.640\nIt just makes things a whole lot easier.\n\n147\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.220\nWhen you work in a line of business it's\nnot about having your mahjong games and\n\n148\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.347\nkeeping your free cell scores high,\nit's about,\n\n149\n00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:50.950\ndoes it have the applications\nI need to run my business?\n\n150\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.050\nIf it does, great.\n\n151\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.545\nIf it doesn't, I need one that does.\n\n152\n00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:54.456\n&gt;&gt; And I need it now, right?\n\n153\n00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Or I need it yesterday.\n\n154\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:06:55.888 --> 00:06:57.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Time is money.\n\n156\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.750\nSo you can see, just like given a scenario\nlike that where, operating system files,\n\n157\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.040\nyes they are important, but\n\n158\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.690\nthey're not detrimental because\nwe can always replace it.\n\n159\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.750\nWe can reinstall an operating system,\nand while that is happening, your\n\n160\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.160\nuser is logging into another computer,\ncontinuing to work with their files.\n\n161\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.710\nAgain from the home user's perspective,\nthings are very important.\n\n162\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.250\nI've commonly said this that the only\nfiles, even in a home user, at my home.\n\n163\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.050\nThe only files that are so\nimportant to me are my photos.\n\n164\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.020\nMy photos of my family.\n\n165\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.080\nThose capture our memories, and\nwe'd like to keep them in our mind, but\n\n166\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.990\nwe also like to see them.\n\n167\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.740\nAnd it's something that we can't\njust duplicate anymore, right?\n\n168\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.740\nSo, I'm not worried about\nthe operating system.\n\n169\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.950\nI'm not worried about any application,\nI don't care what it is.\n\n170\n00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.760\nWhy?\n\n171\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.380\nBecause I keep copies of my license.\n\n172\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.250\nHere's where we go to the back ups, right?\n\n173\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.790\nSo, those might actually in some\nof the documents that I back up.\n\n174\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.659\nI keep my license so that if I\nhave to reinstall an application,\n\n175\n00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:53.221\nI can reactivate it, and I'm good to go.\n\n176\n00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:56.492\nNow, there are some ways\nthat we can do this, right?\n\n177\n00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:01.196\nThere are some ways that we can\nensure That the crucial files within\n\n178\n00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.812\nthe operating system get backed up.\n\n179\n00:08:03.812 --> 00:08:06.156\nNow I'm in Windows 8.1 here, and\n\n180\n00:08:06.156 --> 00:08:11.840\nthere are some very different ways that we\ndo this between Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\n\n181\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.260\nAnd then honestly from Windows 8 on they\nkind of changed a lot of things because of\n\n182\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.930\nthe fact that they make it a lot easier\nfor you to re-install Windows today.\n\n183\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:26.080\nSo in Windows 7, what we do is we're\ngonna drop down to our start button.\n\n184\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.040\nWe're gonna go into Control Panel.\n\n185\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.950\nWe're gonna go into System and Security.\n\n186\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.060\nAnd they have a utility in here\ncalled Backup and Restore.\n\n187\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.970\nSo right there in the Control Panel.\n\n188\n00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.740\nI don't know if we mentioned this\nin the Control Panel utilities, but\n\n189\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.320\njust know that it is\na Control Panel utility.\n\n190\n00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.920\nAnd when I get in here I get the ability\nto do a few different things, right.\n\n191\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.170\nIf I want to make sure that I\nbackup everything in the current\n\n192\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.120\nstate that this machine is, well, guess\nwhat, we talked about in another episode\n\n193\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.350\nwhen you're installing Windows we do image\ndeployment in a corporate environment.\n\n194\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.280\nWell, guess what inside a backup restore,\n\n195\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.630\nthey give you the ability to\ntake an image of this machine.\n\n196\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.250\nYou can take a bit by bit file\nby file copy of everything,\n\n197\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.340\nincluding the operating system\nin its current configuration.\n\n198\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.040\nSo how's that beneficial?\n\n199\n00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.830\nWell there's pros and cons.\n\n200\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.540\nThe con is that it takes\na long time to run an image,\n\n201\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.200\nespecially if you've got a terabyte\nsized drive, cuz it's gonna copy.\n\n202\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.790\nEverything, including slack space.\n\n203\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.840\nIncluding blank space.\n\n204\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.440\nI mean it is a literal bit by bit copy.\n\n205\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.700\nSo that's really the only con to it.\n\n206\n00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.480\nThe pro is that if this hard drive fails.\n\n207\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.775\nIf I get a a malware,\nI almost said a malrus,\n\n208\n00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:41.945\nI dont know what that is, a combination\nof a virus and malware on my machine.\n\n209\n00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:44.875\nIf I get a virus on my machine and\nI just can't recover, well guess what,\n\n210\n00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.735\nI can format the hard drive,\nI can take this image,\n\n211\n00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:51.515\nboot up to the preinstallation\nenvironment, in the recovery tools.\n\n212\n00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:56.815\nI can also use from creating a repair\ndisc and I can reimage the system.\n\n213\n00:09:56.815 --> 00:09:59.450\nHowever maybe I don't\nwanna go through all that.\n\n214\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.450\nMaybe I just wanna do a back up,\nall right?\n\n215\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.890\nWell, this is scheduling a backup.\n\n216\n00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.240\nNotice that it says, set up backup.\n\n217\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.460\nThis is the first\ntelltale sign on the exam\n\n218\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.520\nthat you have never\nscheduled a backup right?\n\n219\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.690\nJust because it says,\nset up back up, all right?\n\n220\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.420\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n221\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.840\nAlright?\nAnd it's going to say starting\n\n222\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.390\nthe back up.\n\n223\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.170\nAnd what it's doing, is it's not\nactually running the back up yet,\n\n224\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.430\nbecause we got to tell back up and\nrestore a few different things, alright?\n\n225\n00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.780\nWhat we need to do first of all,\n\n226\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.720\nis we need to say where is the back\nup going to reside, right?\n\n227\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.220\nBecause we're going to take\ncopies of the files, right?\n\n228\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.940\nAnd we can get really\nspecific on what we take.\n\n229\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.880\nAnd I'll show you what I mean when\nI say that we can pick and choose.\n\n230\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.140\nIf we want operating system files,\nwe can use those.\n\n231\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.120\nIf you're like me, and it's more\nimportant that I just get my photos,\n\n232\n00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.950\nwe can also be selective about that.\n\n233\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.520\nSo there's a few different things\nthat you can use here right.\n\n234\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.400\nNotice that they have the optical drive.\n\n235\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.070\nI wouldn't recommend this.\n\n236\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.350\nHere's why, if that's all you have,\nat least you have something.\n\n237\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.270\nIf you have a 50 gig, 100 gig,\n200 gig backup, guess what?\n\n238\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:09.770\nYour DVDs, at best, have 9.7 gigs on them,\n9.4 gigs if they're double sided.\n\n239\n00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.780\nTypically they only have 4.7 gigs.\n\n240\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.217\n&gt;&gt; So get you a spindle,\nis what you're saying?\n\n241\n00:11:13.217 --> 00:11:14.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n242\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.470\nI mean, even though-\n&gt;&gt; And set a weekend aside.\n\n243\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, cuz even in only 47 gigs,\n\n244\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.750\nyou're gonna have ten disks that\nyou are gonna be putting in.\n\n245\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.640\nAnd you are gonna have to stay there.\n\n246\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.820\n&gt;&gt; Plus it only writes at a certain speed,\nand it's not that, I mean it's fine, but\n\n247\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.240\nit's not great like hard drives,\nUSB ThunderBolt kind of speeds.\n\n248\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.880\nIt's very hands on process to, cuz when we\nsay scheduling back-ups one of the great\n\n249\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.660\nthings is we set it and forget it,\nwe walk away and know it happens.\n\n250\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.960\nIf you're saving this to optical drives,\nyou're waiting, and\n\n251\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.050\nit's gonna stop the backup and\nit's gonna eject the drive.\n\n252\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.160\nGet you a good binge watch TV\nseries cuz you're gonna be sitting\n\n253\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.220\nthere with a computer.\n\n254\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.240\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you might wanna implement\nsome quality of service on your Netflix\n\n255\n00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.030\nstream, [LAUGH] you know?\n\n256\n00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:59.520\nSo I don't recommend it, however you\ncan always have something, all right?\n\n257\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.060\nAnd you can see that they're telling you\nthat external drive is the way to go.\n\n258\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.700\nThis is another drive\nthat's in this machine, and\n\n259\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.520\nIt won't let you save it to C:.\n\n260\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.580\nAnd why?\n\n261\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.900\nWell your backing up C:, you're not\ngoing to back up the drive that your\n\n262\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.240\nmaking a copy of, to the drive your making\na copy of, it just doesn't make sense.\n\n263\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.200\nNow the other thing that you could do as\nwell, is you could save it on the network\n\n264\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.640\nas well, so we could, we can type in\nour UNC path and if you end up having\n\n265\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.870\na location out there on the network,\nlike you guys have seen the same exact\n\n266\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.985\nnetwork share that we've shown you in\nother episodes, I could browse to that.\n\n267\n00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:37.460\nLet me make sure that I'm\nauthenticating against the domain here,\n\n268\n00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.220\nI'm not sure if it's gonna\ngive me a hard time.\n\n269\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.080\nAnd it validates the location,\n\n270\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.890\nso I could also back the information\nup to the network too.\n\n271\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.230\nI'm gonna go ahead,\nwhat I'll do is I'll do a local.\n\n272\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.310\nBut this is also called a local backup\nbecause even though it isn't to the local\n\n273\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.910\nC drive it's still local to the machine,\nright.\n\n274\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.360\nIf I do a network backup it's\nactually going to a remote location,\n\n275\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.230\nwherever that location is\nthat you're sending it.\n\n276\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.955\nJust remember where you sent it.\n\n277\n00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:04.642\n[LAUGH] All right?\n\n278\n00:13:04.642 --> 00:13:06.220\nAll right, so we'll go ahead.\n\n279\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.930\nWe're just gonna,\nwe'll use the local disk c.\n\n280\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.600\nI did wanna just show you the three\npossibilities that you would have there.\n\n281\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.188\nNow, this is kinda cool because\nyou can let Windows choose.\n\n282\n00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:21.830\nIf Windows chooses, you can see, right,\nit says that it's gonna save all\n\n283\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.110\nthe libraries, desktop,\ndefault Windows folders, right?\n\n284\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.990\nAnd it'll create the system image.\n\n285\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.900\nWhich is great because now,\nyou got a system image that'll\n\n286\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.090\nreinstall your operating system and\nyou can point your files back\n\n287\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.870\nto the locations that they were\npreviously before you had the problem.\n\n288\n00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.440\nI'm a bit of a rebel and\n\n289\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.800\nI'm not gonna do anything that's\nrecommended, just ask my doctor.\n\n290\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.260\n[LAUGH] And we'll choose next here.\n\n291\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.890\nAnd here's where we can get kinda really\ngranular on what we wanna save, so\n\n292\n00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:56.070\nI'm gonna go ahead and check all of this,\nin fact I'll check pretty much everything.\n\n293\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.070\nSo I can drill down in here and say, hey,\n\n294\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.970\nit's really my pictures that\nare important, for me that's good.\n\n295\n00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.690\nYou might not want to do this,\nyou might want to do everything.\n\n296\n00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.930\nThen what I can do,\ndown here I can include the system image.\n\n297\n00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.900\nHere's a little thing to keep in mind.\n\n298\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.580\nSometimes on the CompTIA exams, they tell\nyou, how would you do a restoration?\n\n299\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.040\nCuz backup is preventative maintenance,\nbut remember,\n\n300\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.970\nrestore is still part of that.\n\n301\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.510\nIf I restore the machine and\n\n302\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.809\nI use the system image, I also have\nto create a system repair disk.\n\n303\n00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.860\nWhy is that?\n\n304\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.930\nA lot of times you don't have\nyour installation media anymore.\n\n305\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.470\nIt's very few and far between.\n\n306\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.520\nA lot of times you'll have a recovery\npartition, which is good, but\n\n307\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.350\nsometimes you don't even have that So\n\n308\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.760\nwhat you need is the Windows' recovery\nenvironment, Win RE, as it's called.\n\n309\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.090\nThis makes Win RE, oops, excuse me here,\nI don't know what I'm doing and\n\n310\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.350\nI don't know where I sent my backup.\n\n311\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.380\nSo, let me go ahead and\nstart that over here, okay, great.\n\n312\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.340\nI knew that was gonna happen.\n\n313\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.930\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; It worked very well, Wes.\n\n314\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, I appreciate it.\n\n315\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.180\nI'm meant to do that, but\n\n316\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.560\nknow that you can you do have to have your\nsystem repair disc, because what happens\n\n317\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.470\nis when you boot your computer- remember,\nwe've talked about boot methods before,\n\n318\n00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.100\nI'm going to point it to the optical drive\nand what it's going to do is it's going to\n\n319\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.500\nload that memory resident operating\nsystem, the pre-installation environment\n\n320\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.800\nwhich has all of those tools, It allows\nme to do a system image recovery.\n\n321\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.640\nAlright, so we'll go ahead,\nand I'm going to uncheck this.\n\n322\n00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.780\nI'm not going to include assistant image\nin the drive or anything, just for\n\n323\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.340\ntime purposes because it could take A very\nlong while and we only have a half hour in\n\n324\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.910\nthis episode so I don´t want\nto bore you guys with waiting.\n\n325\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.230\nBut it does show you, right?\n\n326\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.190\nIt does show you that hey,\nthis is what´s going to be.\n\n327\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.580\nIt does show you if I can\nkeep it in the screen there,\n\n328\n00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.920\nwhat´s going to be backed up,\nwhat´s not going to be included.\n\n329\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.410\nNow, I said scheduling.\n\n330\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.650\nAnd you know what we've done?\n\n331\n00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.265\nWell what we haven't done at all?\n\n332\n00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:51.163\nWe haven't done any scheduling, right?\n\n333\n00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:56.074\nSo notice that the schedule right\nhere tells you when it's gonna back\n\n334\n00:15:56.074 --> 00:15:57.182\nup your files.\n\n335\n00:15:57.182 --> 00:16:01.819\nIf you use the optical drive,\nyou better be around on Sunday 7:00 P.M.\n\n336\n00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:04.000\nafter going to church or whatever.\n\n337\n00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.900\n&gt;&gt; There better be a blank\ndisc in that drive.\n\n338\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.930\n&gt;&gt; You better have somebody ready to\nfeed them in and feed them out, right?\n\n339\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.640\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna change that schedule.\n\n340\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.270\nAll right, and then here's the option,\nright, run back up on a schedule and\n\n341\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.110\nit is recommended.\n\n342\n00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:25.650\nWe can change it to daily, monthly, weekly\nand again what day and what the time is.\n\n343\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:30.660\nI will tell you, you might think\nwhile daily is really good,\n\n344\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.840\njust like we talked about in things like\nsecurity, Dan you've mentioned this too,\n\n345\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.820\nwhere we talked about convenience.\n\n346\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.054\nAs convenience goes up,\n\n347\n00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:41.874\nsecurity kinda weens as a security goes\nup which are to get less convenience,\n\n348\n00:16:41.874 --> 00:16:45.103\nwell I also want you to know that\nWhen you do daily backups, yeah,\n\n349\n00:16:45.103 --> 00:16:49.277\nyou're getting a lot of fault tolerance or\nresiliency to failure, but you're also\n\n350\n00:16:49.277 --> 00:16:53.620\nincreasing the administrative effort of\nthe upkeep of the operating system, right?\n\n351\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.560\nCuz you're gonna have to just remember,\nokay, especially talking about\n\n352\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.850\nusing optical disks, it might not\nbe worth its weight in gold, so.\n\n353\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.660\n&gt;&gt; And that's a good point,\nyou talked about the worth of it, right?\n\n354\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.240\nIt is more administrative effort.\n\n355\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.800\nAnd you gotta try to\njust find that balance of\n\n356\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.350\nwhat's worth more of my time versus what's\nworth more of my convenience, right?\n\n357\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.770\nSo it's different for every organization,\nit's different for every network.\n\n358\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.670\nSo you just have to figure that\nout by kinda jumping in there.\n\n359\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:25.135\nAnd the first time you go how bad\nwould it be if I lost of this.\n\n360\n00:17:25.135 --> 00:17:28.425\nIf that was no longer around would\nthat be mission critical with that?\n\n361\n00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:31.520\nWould that drop us to our knees or\nwould that not be such a big deal?\n\n362\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.065\nDefinitely weigh the administrative\neffort versus the gain or loss.\n\n363\n00:17:36.065 --> 00:17:39.245\nLike Dan said both sides of the track for\nsure.\n\n364\n00:17:39.245 --> 00:17:43.405\nWe're not going to change anything again,\nI just want to kind of show you where\n\n365\n00:17:43.405 --> 00:17:46.552\nthese settings are so\nif they do ask you on the exam.\n\n366\n00:17:46.552 --> 00:17:47.162\nYou'll be ready.\n\n367\n00:17:47.162 --> 00:17:49.542\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're going to say this settings.\n\n368\n00:17:49.542 --> 00:17:52.842\nAnd I will give it a second here and\nit's gonna run the backup.\n\n369\n00:17:52.842 --> 00:17:55.782\nI want it I want to show you\nall the little screens that\n\n370\n00:17:55.782 --> 00:17:59.520\nthat you'll see here because you could\npotentially see these greens on the exam.\n\n371\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.890\nWe're not sure exactly which one,\nbut we want you to be prepared.\n\n372\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.260\nNotice what's going on here,\nit says, location.\n\n373\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.360\nWe can manage the spaces well,\nif we wanted.\n\n374\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.050\nSo for instance, Manage space,\nwe could come in here and say,\n\n375\n00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.300\nhey, view the backups that\nare currently on the machine.\n\n376\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.420\nGives me kind of the metadata, says,\nhey, this is how big the drive is right,\n\n377\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.200\nthis was the free space that's in it, and\nthis is how much data you're consuming or\n\n378\n00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.440\nspace you're consuming\nwithin that drive right?\n\n379\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.160\nWe can view the individual backups here.\n\n380\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.715\nAnd it looks like yeah it looks\nlike it has finished here.\n\n381\n00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:35.135\nSo we can kinda view the existing backups,\nand\n\n382\n00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:38.745\nthis is great because it gives you\nthe time frame that it's backed up, right?\n\n383\n00:18:38.745 --> 00:18:42.285\nSo if Dan comes to me and says hey Wes,\nI've got a user that's in the sales\n\n384\n00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:47.570\ndepartment and says that they\naccidentally deleted a good portion\n\n385\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.330\nof a folder that we need, I say okay,\nwell do you know what the time is right?\n\n386\n00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.610\nHe say well it's about such and such time\nand I will take this for example right?\n\n387\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.730\nIt was on 7:20 all right?\n\n388\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.350\nIt was somewhere in the middle of the day,\nit's like okay,\n\n389\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.895\nwhat we know I can come here and\nI can say okay, well we have a backup for\n\n390\n00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:05.060\n7:20 If this happened on 7/21,\nit's probably a better example.\n\n391\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.210\nI can restore to that earlier point and\ntime and I can recover that file.\n\n392\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:14.400\nAll right, so, again the recovery\nprocess isn't much different.\n\n393\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.840\nWe're more focused on\nthe backup side of this.\n\n394\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.250\nBut, if you see, I could restore our files\nhere just by choosing the restore side.\n\n395\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.570\nAnd what it'll end up\ndoing is it'll search.\n\n396\n00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.140\nYeah, let's go ahead and\nsearch or browse here.\n\n397\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.470\nShould be able, there we go.\n\n398\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.400\nAnd you can see when I browse there,\nback up of C, all right?\n\n399\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.170\nAnd again, I coud open the folder and\nthis is one of the great things in here,\n\n400\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.040\nyou can come in here,\nyou can look at the folders.\n\n401\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.740\nAnd I say you know what?\n\n402\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.420\nThere's nothing in the public location\nthat I need, well, that's okay.\n\n403\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.990\nI do wanna go ahead and\nI wanna add everything to pictures, right?\n\n404\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.700\nSo, I just happen to have a desktop.INI\nfile, I'm not worried about that,\n\n405\n00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700\nthat's actually.\n\n406\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.360\nThat's actually remnants of\na configuration of the desktop at\n\n407\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.230\nthe time that it took to backup.\n\n408\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.730\nAgain, it just kind of shows you\nthat I could, if I wanted to,\n\n409\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.700\nI could add that file.\n\n410\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.430\nI could choose Next and\n\n411\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.605\nit's intuitive enough to know where\nyou should be setting this file.\n\n412\n00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:11.845\nIt says hey I've got the metadata,\ndata about data,\n\n413\n00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:14.265\nthat tells me where that location was.\n\n414\n00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:17.095\nDo you want me to go ahead and\nrestore that to that location, or\n\n415\n00:20:17.095 --> 00:20:20.465\nin this case maybe it is a situation and\nscenario\n\n416\n00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:24.395\nwhere Dan told a user to take that crucial\nfile and save it on the network share.\n\n417\n00:20:24.395 --> 00:20:25.875\nDon't save it locally.\n\n418\n00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:26.865\nYou saved it locally, and\n\n419\n00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:29.605\nnow we're having to go through this\nproblem of trying to get that file back.\n\n420\n00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:32.230\nIf you would have saved it\nup on the network share\n\n421\n00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.510\nI run backups on the server everyday.\n\n422\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.970\nSo I could say something like\nthat where I say you know what?\n\n423\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.860\nI want to browse to a different location.\n\n424\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.030\nI want to save this not locally.\n\n425\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.205\nI want to do what I told\nyou in the first place.\n\n426\n00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:48.170\n[LAUGH] And I want to end up because\nyou'll run into this with users, trust me.\n\n427\n00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.000\nI wanna go ahead, and I wanna save\nit up on that network share, right?\n\n428\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.760\nAnd then I could do that, and it's not\nreturned to it's original location.\n\n429\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.800\nLike, you guys are a smart\ncrowd out there.\n\n430\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.230\nIt's now on that server, and now Dan's,\nessentially, a system administration.\n\n431\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.540\nThe back ups are happening daily.\n\n432\n00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.980\nHe doesn't have to worry about it anymore.\n\n433\n00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.370\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nnot do that, after all that explanation.\n\n434\n00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.230\nAnd we'll choose Restore and\nit's letting me know,\n\n435\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.540\nit's saying, hey, you've already\ngot a file in this location.\n\n436\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.230\nDo you want to copy and replace it?\n\n437\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.685\nDon't copy, keep both files I'm\nactually going to cancel this.\n\n438\n00:21:21.685 --> 00:21:26.185\nBecause as much as we didn't do,\nI'm not gonna copy it.\n\n439\n00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:28.215\nAll right,\nit says your files have been restored.\n\n440\n00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:31.325\nEven though it really didn't\ndo anything it thinks it did.\n\n441\n00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:35.800\nWe'll let it just think what it wants,\nbut this is actually a system file.\n\n442\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.520\nEven though it was in the user profile,\nit's a hidden file that you don't see,\n\n443\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.270\nby default, on the desktop.\n\n444\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.170\nBut we don't have to worry about that,\n\n445\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.250\nthat's not really anything\nthat's important for the exam.\n\n446\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.030\nAll right, and\nI know we got about a few more minutes.\n\n447\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.435\nI do wanna show you that it's\nslightly different in Windows 8.\n\n448\n00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.370\n8.1 in Windows 8 and 8.1,\n\n449\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.870\nthey kind of did away with\nthe traditional Windows backdrop utility.\n\n450\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.770\nIt is still there, so\nlet me be careful on saying that.\n\n451\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.170\nThey want you to move to a newer\ntechnology that they introduced starting\n\n452\n00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.280\nwith Windows 8 and\nthat´s called \"File History\".\n\n453\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.220\nFile history is continued in Windows 8,\nWindows 8.1, and\n\n454\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.860\nwhen we see the exam objectives\nmove past the 900 series.\n\n455\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.960\nWe'll see that Windows 10 is probably\ngoing to be included there as well,\n\n456\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.220\nas part of that file history\nis also there as well.\n\n457\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.950\nSo this is a great technology, that if\nyou learn it now, here in the 900 exam.\n\n458\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.520\nThat you're not only going to be\nlearning it for one operating system,\n\n459\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.120\nyou're actually learning it for\nthree different additions of Windows or\n\n460\n00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.100\nversions, which is really, really good.\n\n461\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:40.810\nSo let me go ahead, and we'll switch over\nto our Windows eight point one box here.\n\n462\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.350\nWe'll log in and let me show you.\n\n463\n00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.560\nI wanna show you a couple different ways.\n\n464\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:51.060\nI know we kinda left that there\nat the inside of our modern UI.\n\n465\n00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.950\nI want you to know that I can get to\nfile history a couple different ways.\n\n466\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.700\nWe can go the traditional desktop route\nwhich we´ve kind of been doing a lot here.\n\n467\n00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.640\nI can right click on my windows tile,\nI can choose control panel,\n\n468\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.470\ngo into system and security and\nyou´ll see that we have, down here.\n\n469\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.000\nWe have file history.\n\n470\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000\nAnd when I launch up file history\nnotice this launches file history in\n\n471\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.810\nthe traditional control panel.\n\n472\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.610\nHowever, I'm not sure which one they're\ngoing to show you on the exam so\n\n473\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.540\nlet's go ahead and\nlet's you have all of your bases covered.\n\n474\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.275\nWe'll go ahead and close down the\ntraditional control panel interface and\n\n475\n00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:28.472\nwe'll go to the metro or\nmodern UI as well, so we'll go ahead and\n\n476\n00:23:28.472 --> 00:23:30.032\nswitch over to settings here.\n\n477\n00:23:30.032 --> 00:23:32.672\nRemember, my heads kinda\ncovering it up here,\n\n478\n00:23:32.672 --> 00:23:37.160\nit always does that with the charms here,\nif I scroll down to the settings charm,\n\n479\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.252\nI choose change PC settings and then\nif we scroll down you probably already\n\n480\n00:23:41.252 --> 00:23:45.542\nseen it when we went to the recovery\nsection there, update and recovery, and\n\n481\n00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:49.436\nthen from update and recovery not\nonly do you have Window's Update and\n\n482\n00:23:49.436 --> 00:23:51.831\nRecovery you also have file history here.\n\n483\n00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.341\nAll right?\nAnd\n\n484\n00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:57.081\nunderstand that I can turn file history on\nand, see, it says back up your personal\n\n485\n00:23:57.081 --> 00:24:00.598\ndrive and it's already backing\nit up to a certain location.\n\n486\n00:24:00.598 --> 00:24:03.910\nBut I'm gonna actually start this and\nwe'll start the process over.\n\n487\n00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.760\nAnd I can select a different drive and\n\n488\n00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.830\nnotice it lets me know\nwhat drive that might be.\n\n489\n00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.020\nIn the modern UI,\nyou don't really get as much flexibility.\n\n490\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.822\nI could select the same drive,\nit's going to the same drive there,\n\n491\n00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:19.070\nso it [LAUGH] really\ndidn't do anything there.\n\n492\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.648\nBut I do wanna show you that interface.\n\n493\n00:24:20.648 --> 00:24:23.004\nI like the control panel\ninterface better than I do.\n\n494\n00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:25.515\nAnd it's not that I don;t\nlike the modern UI.\n\n495\n00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:29.384\nBut it's kinda like the difference between\nasking somebody, for instance Dan,\n\n496\n00:24:29.384 --> 00:24:32.280\nwho's familiar with command prompt,\na terminal, right?\n\n497\n00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.161\nVersus the graphical user interface,\nright?\n\n498\n00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:36.625\nThe terminal has so\nmuch more things that you can do,\n\n499\n00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:40.213\nbecause if I don't have the button,\nI can't perform that functionality.\n\n500\n00:24:40.213 --> 00:24:44.509\nWell, that's kind of akin to the control\npanel version of file history versus\n\n501\n00:24:44.509 --> 00:24:45.370\nmodern UI.\n\n502\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.500\nWe don't have a lot of options there.\n\n503\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.065\nControl panel is a more mature, however\nyou would say that, interface, so again,\n\n504\n00:24:52.065 --> 00:24:54.394\nit does have a few more bells and\nwhistles.\n\n505\n00:24:54.394 --> 00:24:59.307\nThat being, said let's drop back to the\nControl Panel, again System and Security.\n\n506\n00:24:59.307 --> 00:25:03.428\nI know I did that kinda fast,\nI did that with my superpowers [LAUGH] and\n\n507\n00:25:03.428 --> 00:25:04.671\nthen file history.\n\n508\n00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:08.153\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna turn off,\nI did this for a reason.\n\n509\n00:25:08.153 --> 00:25:10.299\nCuz I wanna kind of show you\nwhen you would come in here,\n\n510\n00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:11.780\nthis is what you would see.\n\n511\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.050\nYou would see that there\nisn't anything set up here.\n\n512\n00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.280\nUnderstand that you can\nselect your drives.\n\n513\n00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:25.270\nSo, for instance, I can select drives and\nI do have local disk Z there as well.\n\n514\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.761\n&gt;&gt; Zed for our Australian and\nEnglish counterparts.\n\n515\n00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:29.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n516\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.040\nBut something that we\ndidn't have in Windows 7,\n\n517\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.790\nwhich is why I wanted to show you this,\nis I also have storage spaces.\n\n518\n00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.060\nWe created in another episode, Dan and I,\nwhen were looking at some of the features,\n\n519\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.770\nwe put together a storage space here,\naggregated a couple of drives together.\n\n520\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.536\nI could also use storage spaces for\nfile history.\n\n521\n00:25:45.536 --> 00:25:47.310\nAnd I really like that capability, too.\n\n522\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:51.224\nBecause if one of those drives fails,\nI still have access to my backup, so\n\n523\n00:25:51.224 --> 00:25:53.322\nit's kinda like backup to the backup.\n\n524\n00:25:53.322 --> 00:25:55.159\n&gt;&gt; Redundancy to the redundancy.\n\n525\n00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:57.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n526\n00:25:57.023 --> 00:26:01.540\nin the dictionary for the definition\nof redundancy, it says see redundancy.\n\n527\n00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.828\n&gt;&gt; Recursive redundancy,\nthat's where we're gonna go.\n\n528\n00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:04.399\nWe just coined the phrase right here.\n\n529\n00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:05.919\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, so\n\n530\n00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:08.683\nyou couls also add a a network\nlocation here as well.\n\n531\n00:26:08.683 --> 00:26:11.130\nSo let me go ahead,\njust take a second to do that.\n\n532\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.450\nIf you have File Explorer on, you could\nend up seeing like you have these\n\n533\n00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.486\nclickable hot icons,\nas they're kinda called.\n\n534\n00:26:18.486 --> 00:26:21.436\nAnd I could choose DC1\nhere if I'm in the right.\n\n535\n00:26:21.436 --> 00:26:26.430\nNo, I do have to authenticate here,\nso let me make sure that I do that.\n\n536\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.020\nIt's not gonna like it.\n\n537\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.980\nIt's not gonna just let you in\nbecause you knocked on the door.\n\n538\n00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.719\nYou have to know the secret password.\n\n539\n00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:35.323\n[LAUGH] And then once you do that-\n&gt;&gt; The password is.\n\n540\n00:26:35.323 --> 00:26:37.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Once you do that,\nyou can select the location, and\n\n541\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.830\nI can choose Select Folder.\n\n542\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.020\nAnd now you see, just like before,\nit shows up in the list.\n\n543\n00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.310\nAnd I tell you what,\n\n544\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.030\nI'm gonna do storage spaces,\njust because I like storage spaces.\n\n545\n00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.501\nAnd then what we'll do is we'll come down\nhere and we'll choose OK, all right?\n\n546\n00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:55.403\nAnd it says do you wanna use this drive\nfor file history again, all right?\n\n547\n00:26:55.403 --> 00:26:57.590\nThe drive doesn't have\nyour most recent files.\n\n548\n00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.260\nThat's perfectly fine, I'm okay with that.\n\n549\n00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:05.220\nAnd then it tells me that it's going to\ncopy the location, all right, and it has.\n\n550\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.700\nAnd I could run it right\nhere from this hyperlink.\n\n551\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.510\nI also wanna show you that\nyou have the exclusions.\n\n552\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.450\nExclusions just mean take this library,\nbut don't take that library.\n\n553\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.540\nI just want my pictures,\nI don't care about videos, right?\n\n554\n00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.470\nI just want pictures.\n\n555\n00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.310\nI don't care about certain documents.\n\n556\n00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.986\nOr I just care about documents and I don't\ncare about Johnny's MP3 collection that he\n\n557\n00:27:23.986 --> 00:27:27.077\nshouldn't be storing on this\nmachine anyways, right?\n\n558\n00:27:27.077 --> 00:27:28.814\nYou also have Advanced Settings too.\n\n559\n00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:33.923\nAnd the Advanced Settings are really cool\nin the fact that they give you the ability\n\n560\n00:27:33.923 --> 00:27:38.305\nto determine how long you wanna save\ncopies and how often I should say.\n\n561\n00:27:38.305 --> 00:27:40.055\nCuz remember, it's about scheduling.\n\n562\n00:27:40.055 --> 00:27:42.555\nThat's the whole point of\nthis is scheduling backups.\n\n563\n00:27:42.555 --> 00:27:46.355\nNotice it gives you\nthe schedule on it as well.\n\n564\n00:27:46.355 --> 00:27:51.660\nI also can say, how much of the drive do\nI wanna use in the offline cache, right?\n\n565\n00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.100\nDo I want to start overriding files\nwhen it gets to 20% of the disk space.\n\n566\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.003\nAgain, that's gonna be up to\nyou as to what you choose.\n\n567\n00:27:59.003 --> 00:28:01.702\nA lot of times I just\ngo with the defaults.\n\n568\n00:28:01.702 --> 00:28:05.352\nBut you, for whatever reason, Dan\nmentioned it, it's personal computing, and\n\n569\n00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:07.730\nit's not really\na one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n570\n00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.460\nOr there wouldn't be any options here.\n\n571\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.630\nKeep saved versions, how often do you\nwanna keep the version of a file?\n\n572\n00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.870\nAnd you can see that I wanna keep\nthem forever, right, by default.\n\n573\n00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.280\nDo I wanna use and\nintegrate this with homegroup?\n\n574\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.780\nYou can also do that as well, so\nthat's also a great thing to have.\n\n575\n00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.770\nI'll tell you what,\nlet me go ahead real quick.\n\n576\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.690\nAnd I know we're well out of time here,\nDan.\n\n577\n00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.960\nIf you'll just bear with me here.\n\n578\n00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.570\nWe'll call this a recovery,\nas a recovery txt.\n\n579\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.100\nAnd we'll jump back down to file recovery.\n\n580\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.849\nAnd what we'll do is,\nwe'll go ahead and run this now and\n\n581\n00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:46.818\nhopefully it'll run for us.\n\n582\n00:28:46.818 --> 00:28:47.577\nIt might just do it.\n\n583\n00:28:47.577 --> 00:28:49.457\n&gt;&gt; It might already be done.\n\n584\n00:28:49.457 --> 00:28:51.462\n&gt;&gt; It might already be done, absolutely.\n\n585\n00:28:51.462 --> 00:28:54.710\nSo let's see, well, you know what?\n\n586\n00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.179\nThere's only one way to find out.\n\n587\n00:28:56.179 --> 00:28:59.574\nHere, we're gonna be flying without a net\nand I didn't put this in the notes, Dan.\n\n588\n00:28:59.574 --> 00:29:02.527\nSo we are flying without the-\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed.\n\n589\n00:29:02.527 --> 00:29:05.093\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're walking across the high\n\n590\n00:29:05.093 --> 00:29:06.738\nwire and the net's gone.\n\n591\n00:29:06.738 --> 00:29:07.966\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we'll go ahead and-\n\n592\n00:29:07.966 --> 00:29:08.706\n&gt;&gt; Who moved my net?\n\n593\n00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:11.021\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't fall!\n\n594\n00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:14.548\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nsee if Wes falls on his face here.\n\n595\n00:29:14.548 --> 00:29:17.273\nIf I do,\nyou guys can always laugh with us along.\n\n596\n00:29:17.273 --> 00:29:19.232\n&gt;&gt; This is must-see TV right here!\n&gt;&gt; I'll be dying inside but\n\n597\n00:29:19.232 --> 00:29:21.500\nyou guys can laugh with us out there.\n\n598\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.050\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n599\n00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.620\nthe thing you can do here is\nyou can restore personal files.\n\n600\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.600\nThey made it very easy to do this.\n\n601\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.350\nI really like this interface.\n\n602\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:34.293\nIf we go ahead and we run the restore\npersonal files, notice that it says, okay,\n\n603\n00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:36.707\nso what do you want to restore, right?\n\n604\n00:29:36.707 --> 00:29:40.216\nWell, I have Desktop here and\nI got a file location and look at there.\n\n605\n00:29:40.216 --> 00:29:43.894\nNot only did it get that, but\nI also get the desktop.ini file.\n\n606\n00:29:43.894 --> 00:29:47.470\nAnd I didn't have to tell it in the backup\nit's there, but that's a system file.\n\n607\n00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.169\nI'm not really worried about it,\nbut there's my recovery text.\n\n608\n00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:55.889\nI choose Restore and if I go out to\nmy desktop and open it File Explorer,\n\n609\n00:29:55.889 --> 00:30:00.849\nI'm hoping, fingers crossed,\nthat sure enough even after we took it out\n\n610\n00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:05.340\nof the recycle bin, we recycled it,\nrecovery text is back there.\n\n611\n00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.760\nSo, Dan, again, you guys out there,\nthank you for bearing with me on this one.\n\n612\n00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.330\nI know this one has run\na little bit longer.\n\n613\n00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.430\nWe got a lot more to cover,\n\n614\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.700\nbut these are just some of the things\nthat you're gonna need to know.\n\n615\n00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.610\nAnd we didn't wanna\nshort-change you in anyway.\n\n616\n00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right, learn how to take\nyour backups, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n617\n00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:22.140\nBecause they can definitely save your life\nwhen it comes to being a computer tech,\n\n618\n00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.780\neven if you're not.\n\n619\n00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.520\nIf you're just a person who has\na computer, which is most people, right?\n\n620\n00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.670\nLike Wes said, they've got those pictures,\nthey're priceless,\n\n621\n00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.870\nyou can't get them back.\n\n622\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.460\nSo make sure that you're backing\nthem up some way, shape or form.\n\n623\n00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.778\nWindows affords us a great backup\nsolution for even the home PC.\n\n624\n00:30:36.778 --> 00:30:41.230\nSo take advantage of it, learn how to\nuse it, and use it to your advantage.\n\n625\n00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.880\nThat being said, as Wes was alluding to,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n626\n00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.220\nCome back for part two.\n\n627\n00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.190\nCuz we have plenty of more\npreventative things that we can do\n\n628\n00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.290\nto keep our computers on the up and up.\n\n629\n00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.140\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n630\n00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n631\n00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.214\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n632\n00:30:57.214 --> 00:31:03.167\n[MUSIC]\n\n633\n00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:05.714\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.822\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:17.210\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.130\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well guess what,\n\n7\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550\nyou're here for A+ and\nthat's what we're serving up.\n\n8\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.470\nJoining us back in the studio again to\ncontinue our conversation on preventative\n\n9\n00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.410\nmaintenance, things that we can do\nto keep our computers running and\n\n10\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.580\nin good health,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.430\nWes, so glad to have you again man,\nhow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.380\nThat's right, we're gonna continue on and\n\n14\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.258\nin the first part we were talking\nabout well, backups, and we were\n\n15\n00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:43.490\nalso talking about the difference between\nWindows 7 backups and Windows 8.1 backups.\n\n16\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.890\nWe talked a little bit about\nthe backup and restore software,\n\n17\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.470\nas well as in Windows 8 and then 8.1 file\nhistory, right, so a couple different\n\n18\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.400\nways that you need to perform preventative\nmaintenance on those machines.\n\n19\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.425\nNow we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nmove down our list of objectives here and\n\n20\n00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:04.480\nthey talk about scheduled disk\nmaintenance, wow, let's talk about that\n\n21\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.896\nfor a little bit because, guess what,\nyou don't have to schedule it.\n\n22\n00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:11.790\n[LAUGH] It's been scheduled out for\nyou for a very long time now, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.820\nwhen I say very long time keep in\nmind that Vista, I think Vista was\n\n24\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.600\nreleased in 2007 I wanna say, and here\nwe are ten years later and since Vista\n\n25\n00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.750\nnormal things like this maintenance\nare actually part of Task Scheduler.\n\n26\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.870\nIn fact let's go ahead and show you,\n\n27\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.490\nI'll show you on the Windows\n7 machine that I have here.\n\n28\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.920\nLet's say that I wanted to perform,\n\n29\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.240\nlet's say defragmentation right, again\nthat's gonna be part of disk maintenance.\n\n30\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.580\nAnd what I can do here really\nis I can go to the Start,\n\n31\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.540\nwell there's a couple different\nways that you can do this.\n\n32\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.510\nActually you can go to the Start\nbutton you can go to Computer, or\n\n33\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.110\nyou can go to File Explorer and\nthen you can choose Computer over\n\n34\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.380\nhere in the Explorer bar, right,\nthe file hierarchy if you will.\n\n35\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.490\nSo couple different ways that you can\nget to Computer, and then we can select\n\n36\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.370\nthe disk that it is that you wanna\nperform the disk defragmentation.\n\n37\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.080\nYou can turn around and what you\ncan do is you can right-click, and\n\n38\n00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.870\nthen from here you could\nchoose Properties,\n\n39\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.400\nnow be careful because if you\naren't choosing the actual disk and\n\n40\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.590\nyou do a right-click you're gonna\nget the wrong set of options.\n\n41\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.910\nNotice that this is just since you're\nin the computer control panel,\n\n42\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.340\nwhen I right-click and I choose\nProperties notice that it's bringing up\n\n43\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.940\nsystem control panel,\nthat's not what I want, right?\n\n44\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.410\nSo make sure that the local disk c or\nthe disk in question is highlighted, and\n\n45\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.639\nthen what you can do from here is you can\nright-click and you can choose Properties.\n\n46\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.190\nNow from the disk's properties\nthat you are currently looking at,\n\n47\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.680\nnotice that we have this Tools tab, right.\n\n48\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.210\nThe Tools tab is the one that I want and\nthis is where we can do different type of\n\n49\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.970\ndisk maintenance, now you can do things\nlike for instance running Check Disk.\n\n50\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.310\nWe can run a Check Disk on it and\nwhat that would do is we\n\n51\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.610\nwould ask it to fix system file errors,\nif you will, and\n\n52\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.730\nthen scan for areas that have stored\ndata in that are failing sectors and\n\n53\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.440\nit would try to pull that data if it was\nreadable, essentially recover it and write\n\n54\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.650\nit to a good portion of the hard drive and\nthen mark those sectors as bad so\n\n55\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.650\nthat the operating system doesn't try\nto send information to them again.\n\n56\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.730\nSo that is one thing that you can do and\ntypically you're gonna schedule this,\n\n57\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.640\nyou gonna run this after a reboot because\nkeep in mind that the operating system is\n\n58\n00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.860\ncurrently using the hard drive, right.\n\n59\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.570\nWe might not think that it's using\nthe hard drive, but if we open up\n\n60\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.310\nour Task Manager, right, and we look in\nthe background and we look at, let's see,\n\n61\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.102\nPerformance, there is some paging\nthat's going on right now, right.\n\n62\n00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:50.670\nIt talks about page memory, that's the\narea of the hard drive that's being used\n\n63\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.120\njust like it was physical memory, so\n\n64\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.790\nyou're operating system is currently\nwriting to this disk as we speak so\n\n65\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.610\nyou can't be using it at the same time\nthat you're trying to repair it, right.\n\n66\n00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.070\nSo just keep in mind that that is, even\nthough it doesn't really say scheduled\n\n67\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.240\nthat is a form of scheduled maintenance\nthat you can do on the disk as well,\n\n68\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.860\nyou go to run this and\nit does it after the reboot.\n\n69\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.730\nBut what I'm really looking at\nis the defragmentation side,\n\n70\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.730\nnotice it says Defragment Now and\nthis brings up Disk Defragmenter.\n\n71\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.757\nAnd that's one of the ways that you\ncan get to the Disk Defragmenter,\n\n72\n00:04:21.757 --> 00:04:25.922\nthe other way that you can get to it\nis through Control Panel &gt; System and\n\n73\n00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:28.090\nSecurity &gt; Administrative Tools.\n\n74\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.084\nOops, just a bit outside,\nball one, let's try that again.\n\n75\n00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:35.008\n[LAUGH] Administrative Tools here,\nand I don't see it in, you know what,\n\n76\n00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.970\nit isn't in [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they hide it now.\n\n77\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.196\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They hide it now, that's right,\n\n78\n00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.930\nit is no longer in Administrative Tools,\nso strike that.\n\n79\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Who needs it there,\nthat just makes too much sense, Wes.\n\n80\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, scratch that.\n\n81\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.745\nI wonder if it's still in Computer\nManagement, maybe that's why I went there,\n\n82\n00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:56.381\ntry to save some face here on camera\nhere but no, it really isn't.\n\n83\n00:04:56.381 --> 00:05:01.032\nThere was a time when it was actually\ninside of your Computer Management back in\n\n84\n00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:04.413\nthe day, but it isn't anymore so\nyeah, scratch that and\n\n85\n00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:07.452\nwell I'm glad I showed you\nthe very first way to go.\n\n86\n00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:08.694\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's the way to go.\n\n87\n00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's the, exactly,\n[LAUGH], cuz that's the way to go.\n\n88\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.650\nSo keep in mind that when you\nchoose Disk Defragmenter I want\n\n89\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.689\nyou to notice something here, let's see,\n\n90\n00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.059\nScheduled defragmentation is\nalready turned on, all right.\n\n91\n00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:26.031\nWhen Vista came out, all right, they said\na lot of people, the average end user,\n\n92\n00:05:26.031 --> 00:05:30.061\ndoesn't even know what fragmentation is,\nright, well maybe you don't know what\n\n93\n00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:33.574\nfragmentation is so let's go ahead and\nexplain that and as to why we would\n\n94\n00:05:33.574 --> 00:05:37.700\neven do this in the first place,\nor even want it to be scheduled.\n\n95\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:44.360\nWhen you have a brand new fresh operating\nsystem the files within the operating\n\n96\n00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.990\nsystem on the physical disk are in\na contiguous fashion, we write to the,\n\n97\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.600\nwe fill up the drive, we keep writing\nto the new locations of the drive.\n\n98\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.020\nBut then you start moving files around and\nyou start deleting files,\n\n99\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.070\nwell that leaves an empty space in\nthat contiguous storage, right.\n\n100\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.023\nAnd then you add something to another file\nand it expands the file, well you're not\n\n101\n00:06:08.023 --> 00:06:12.623\nwriting it to that empty space, you're\nactually writing it on the outside of\n\n102\n00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:17.251\nthe sector, if you will, or the platters\nwithin the physical drive itself.\n\n103\n00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:21.472\nNow I want you to think about if you have\na filing cabinet and I open the filing\n\n104\n00:06:21.472 --> 00:06:26.104\ncabinet, right, and I have folders in\nthere and portions of a document, right.\n\n105\n00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:29.059\nAnd there's a 900 page\ndocument that you have,\n\n106\n00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:33.733\n50 pages are in a folder that is closer\nto the front of that drawer, 100 pages\n\n107\n00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:38.337\nare somewhere in the middle of the drawer,\n100 pages are a few folders down,\n\n108\n00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:42.280\nright, all the way scattered out\nthrough that whole entire shelf.\n\n109\n00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.950\nWell for you to put that document together\nso that you can read it as a human,\n\n110\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.120\nyou would have to go through a lot of\ndifferent places to put all those papers\n\n111\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.080\nback together to be able to see it.\n\n112\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.660\nWell storage on a physical media works\njust like that when we're talking\n\n113\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.780\nabout a document within the operating\nsystem, but when we look at it any kind of\n\n114\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.920\nfile that we see if just, to us it's just,\nfor instance right here on the desktop.\n\n115\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.410\nSo if I created a file here, right, and\n\n116\n00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.120\nI open it I see it in a single location,\nbut when you have this fragmentation it's\n\n117\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.120\nactually stored in different\nlocations physically on the disk and\n\n118\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.340\nthat makes performance start to,\nthe performance just goes down, right.\n\n119\n00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.880\nSo when we do a disk defragmentation\nwhat we're doing is we're realigning all\n\n120\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.860\nthe files in a nice contiguous fashion and\nit makes it a lot easier on the operating\n\n121\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.500\nsystem and then the drive controller\nspeaking to the drivers, if you will, to\n\n122\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.340\nactually present that information to you\nso you get a better performance out it.\n\n123\n00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.980\nAnd that just is why we would\ndo a disk defragmentation and\n\n124\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.770\nany kind of disk\nmaintenance to begin with.\n\n125\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.414\nBut we can also configure the schedule\nif we want to, just like we did when we\n\n126\n00:07:46.414 --> 00:07:51.234\nshowed you in the first part when we\nwere talking about our backup utilities.\n\n127\n00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:53.943\nSo and I can select the disks that I want,\n\n128\n00:07:53.943 --> 00:07:57.211\nright, it doesn't have\nto be just your C drive,\n\n129\n00:07:57.211 --> 00:08:02.186\nit can also be any kind of other drives\nthat you have within the system too.\n\n130\n00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:05.732\nAll right, now you go to the analyzation\nunderstand though I have a solid\n\n131\n00:08:05.732 --> 00:08:07.197\nstate drive in this machine.\n\n132\n00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:11.726\nSo because of that fact solid state\ndrives they do not delete information\n\n133\n00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:15.450\nthe same way traditional\nmechanical magnetic drive does.\n\n134\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.220\nWhen a mechanical drive, when you delete\na file in the operating system, all you're\n\n135\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.640\ndoing is a, you're erasing the pointer and\nwhat's known as the master file table.\n\n136\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.673\nIt's just taking it and kinda\nscratching a line through it, right, or\n\n137\n00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:30.440\njust going like this.\n\n138\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.140\nThe file is still physically\nlocated on the platters themselves.\n\n139\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.466\nAnd then when you need to write to\nthat location, nothing stops it.\n\n140\n00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:38.014\n&gt;&gt; Machine.\n\n141\n00:08:38.014 --> 00:08:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing stops it, that's right.\n\n142\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.434\nYour machine just overrides,\n\n143\n00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:43.080\nthat's why overriders work\nreally good at data destruction.\n\n144\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.970\nBecause all they're doing is they're\noverriding every location of that drive\n\n145\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.740\nwith multiple passes with new binary bits,\nright?\n\n146\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.135\nSolid state drives work a little\nbit different than that.\n\n147\n00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:58.083\nThey operate on a combination of\nwhat's known as garbage collection and\n\n148\n00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:02.548\nthe trim functionality in which that when\nI delete a file from a solid state drive,\n\n149\n00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:07.560\nwhat happens is the drive controller says,\ngo ahead and erase that right now.\n\n150\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.480\nErase it, clear the cell, write the data\nthere that you don't want to delete, and\n\n151\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.080\nthen write the new data down.\n\n152\n00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.790\nAnd what that helps is that keeps\nthe performance of solid state drives up.\n\n153\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.371\nIn the earlier days, you would get\nwhat's known as garbage collection.\n\n154\n00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:25.992\nThere'd be a lot of this, essentially,\nfiles that weren't deleted.\n\n155\n00:09:25.992 --> 00:09:30.930\nAnd what would happen is to overwrite\nfirst you'd have to pull the information,\n\n156\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.680\nall the information, even if you're saving\nit, write it to a buffer, clear the cell.\n\n157\n00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.210\nWrite the old data that you still\nwanted to save back to the cell and\n\n158\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.040\nthen write your brand new file, right.\n\n159\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.640\nSo you would start to see the performance\njust really, really wane.\n\n160\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.331\nJust go really bad on\nthese solid state drives.\n\n161\n00:09:49.331 --> 00:09:51.830\nThey introduced the trim command.\n\n162\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.605\nAnd the trim command said, hey,\nthe moment you perform a delete operation,\n\n163\n00:09:55.605 --> 00:09:56.427\nclear the cell.\n\n164\n00:09:56.427 --> 00:10:00.134\nSo that when we get back to it,\nwe get total functionality or\n\n165\n00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:01.699\nbetter functionality.\n\n166\n00:10:01.699 --> 00:10:04.426\nNow inside of Windows,\nthis is Windows 7 here.\n\n167\n00:10:04.426 --> 00:10:06.872\nKeep in mind that we can\nalso do this in Windows 8.\n\n168\n00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:10.686\nI will tell you it is a little bit\ndifferent in what they call it inside of\n\n169\n00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:11.430\nWindows 8.\n\n170\n00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.684\nApparently, I gotta log in here.\n\n171\n00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:18.632\nIn case you guys and gals out there don't\nknow how to log in, I'm glad you are here.\n\n172\n00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:22.689\n[LAUGH] We are going to go ahead and\ngo pretty much the same route here.\n\n173\n00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:28.309\nI am going to open up File Explorer,\nnotice it doesn't say computer anymore.\n\n174\n00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:29.357\nIt says This PC.\n\n175\n00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:31.403\nAnd like we've told you before,\n\n176\n00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:35.140\nthat could be a text-based answer\nto a question on the exam.\n\n177\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.985\nSo you want to know that it isn't Computer\n\n178\n00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:45.667\ninside of Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n179\n00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:48.094\nBut the process is gonna be\npretty much the same here.\n\n180\n00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:51.847\nNotice that I got Local Disk C and\nif I right-click I choose Properties.\n\n181\n00:10:51.847 --> 00:10:56.665\nAnd now, I will tell you that they've\nkinda given a new name to a old technology\n\n182\n00:10:56.665 --> 00:10:58.130\nagain here on this one.\n\n183\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.630\nSo another thing that I want you\nto be familiar with on the exam.\n\n184\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.450\nAgain, you're not going to this\ndefragmenter inside of Windows 8 and\n\n185\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.155\nWindows 8.1.\n\n186\n00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:10.621\nNow, what they do is they call it\noptimize and defrag or defragment and\n\n187\n00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:12.220\nwe can choose Optimize.\n\n188\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.370\nIt's pretty much the same utility, but\nthey call it the drive optimizer today so\n\n189\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.400\nwe're optimizing drives.\n\n190\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.550\nWe can also, again,\nnotice that the schedule is on.\n\n191\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.060\nNotice it says the drives are being\noptimized automatically and\n\n192\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.890\nit sets the frequency.\n\n193\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.601\nThis is something that's just\ncontinued from the days of Vista.\n\n194\n00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:34.318\nHowever, if we want we do get\nthe ability to change how often we\n\n195\n00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:37.510\nwant this to happen, so that is up to you.\n\n196\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.540\nThere is no right or wrong way here, but\n\n197\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.490\nyou can see that in the background it\nis something that you can perform.\n\n198\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.415\nNow, notice that it's telling me here, and\n\n199\n00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.653\nI'm glad I kinda get to show\nyou guys this on camera.\n\n200\n00:11:48.653 --> 00:11:51.059\nNotice it says solid state drive.\n\n201\n00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:53.940\nAll right, optimization isn't available.\n\n202\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.381\nYou do not benefit defragging or\noptimizing as they call it,\n\n203\n00:11:57.381 --> 00:11:59.141\nstill just defragmentation.\n\n204\n00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:01.443\nYou do not benefit that\non a solid state drive.\n\n205\n00:12:01.443 --> 00:12:02.176\nSo it's good to know.\n\n206\n00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:05.529\n&gt;&gt; Those drives are just optimized and\ndefragged by nature, they're great.\n\n207\n00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:09.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right so non-mechanical\ndrives do not benefit from this.\n\n208\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.811\nAnd I also have a storage space that\ntells me it's thin provisioned.\n\n209\n00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:18.220\nDon't let that fool you, it just means\nthat I haven't used all of the space.\n\n210\n00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.980\nAnd again, so it tells me right now\nthat I've got 100% space efficiency.\n\n211\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.134\nSo there's nothing I\nreally need to do to it.\n\n212\n00:12:25.134 --> 00:12:27.810\nNow, it's kind of interesting cuz\nit's lying to the operating system in\n\n213\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.636\nthe background this is\nstill solid state drives.\n\n214\n00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:30.222\n&gt;&gt; Filthy liar.\n\n215\n00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:31.124\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n216\n00:12:31.124 --> 00:12:35.606\n[LAUGH] It still sees it as\na thin provision storage space.\n\n217\n00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:39.239\nBut really underneath the hood,\nit still is a solid state drive, so\n\n218\n00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:41.296\nit wouldn't benefit either from it.\n\n219\n00:12:41.296 --> 00:12:44.470\nAgain, that kinda shows\nyou what you can do there.\n\n220\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.960\nNow, the next thing that we've gotta\ntalk about is something known as\n\n221\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.860\npatch management.\n\n222\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.160\nAnd when we talk about patch management,\npatch management is, essentially,\n\n223\n00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.680\nis a systematic approach to applying\nupdates to your machines to\n\n224\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.280\nmaximize stability and up time.\n\n225\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.218\nIt's essentially what patch management is,\nand there is a method to the madness here.\n\n226\n00:13:02.218 --> 00:13:05.447\nAll right, and let me show you what I mean\nhere, since we're already in our Windows\n\n227\n00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:08.743\n8.1 machine, we'll bump back over in\na second and show you, Windows 7 as well.\n\n228\n00:13:08.743 --> 00:13:13.048\nAnd again we kinda wanna show you a few\ndifferent operating systems, right.\n\n229\n00:13:13.048 --> 00:13:14.523\nThat they might ask you on the exam.\n\n230\n00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:17.293\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna right click eventually, well,\n\n231\n00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:19.706\nI'll tell you what,\nwhile it's thinking about working.\n\n232\n00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll go over here to Windows 7 and\n\n233\n00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.539\nlet me close down some of\nthese screens here so-\n\n234\n00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:26.256\n&gt;&gt; It thinks, therefore,\n\n235\n00:13:26.256 --> 00:13:26.809\nit's slow [LAUGH].\n\n236\n00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:31.126\n&gt;&gt; That's right we gotta give\nit a little bit more memory.\n\n237\n00:13:31.126 --> 00:13:35.487\n&gt;&gt; When I get into Windows 7, what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna end up launching\n\n238\n00:13:35.487 --> 00:13:37.577\nthe start button &gt; control panel.\n\n239\n00:13:37.577 --> 00:13:39.770\nI'm gonna go to System and Security.\n\n240\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.897\nAnd then we have\nWindows Update right here.\n\n241\n00:13:41.897 --> 00:13:46.080\nAnd the great thing is I am\nconnected outbound to the Internet.\n\n242\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.166\nI do have a few updates,\nquite a few actually,\n\n243\n00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.888\nthey're already installed on here.\n\n244\n00:13:49.888 --> 00:13:53.200\nSo we can kind of give you the rundown\non everything that you might see when\n\n245\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.515\nit comes to Windows update.\n\n246\n00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:57.516\nAll right remember you do have\nsome task links over here and\n\n247\n00:13:57.516 --> 00:14:01.630\nthese are good to understand and know for\nthe exam and know what they're about.\n\n248\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.250\nNotice that if you've never checked for\nupdates before,\n\n249\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.797\nyou won't have any of\nthis information here.\n\n250\n00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:12.565\nYou'll have a little red check, or a red\nX that says never checked for updates and\n\n251\n00:14:12.565 --> 00:14:14.570\nthen it'll say, do you want to check now?\n\n252\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.781\nIt's already downloaded this update and\nthat's why it says install,\n\n253\n00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:20.270\nit could say download the update.\n\n254\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.610\nOnce it reaches out to Windows update\nservers, Microsoft Windows update servers.\n\n255\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.750\nIt'll say, it'll pull down some meta data,\nright, just a little file that says\n\n256\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.210\nhere's the available updates for\nyour operating system.\n\n257\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.920\nThen it's up to you to choose,\ndo you want to download and install?\n\n258\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.230\nWell I already said download and install,\nand now it's to the install process.\n\n259\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.616\nI know it still says download and\ninstall, but if I choose this,\n\n260\n00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:44.982\nI can find out what this update is.\n\n261\n00:14:44.982 --> 00:14:48.468\nAnd since this is Windows 7 again,\nthey have a rollup package,\n\n262\n00:14:48.468 --> 00:14:50.353\nwhich is really an all inclusive.\n\n263\n00:14:50.353 --> 00:14:54.974\nIt includes things like any service\npacks that might be available,\n\n264\n00:14:54.974 --> 00:14:56.604\nthings like hot fixes.\n\n265\n00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.984\nHot fixes are typically\njust security related,\n\n266\n00:14:59.984 --> 00:15:04.040\nmeans we got to essentially\napply a patch to a system.\n\n267\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.710\nAnd we can't wait for\nthe normal patch cycle.\n\n268\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.700\nWhich inside of Windows\nis usually patch Tuesday.\n\n269\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.271\nSecond Tuesday of every month is when they\nroll out all their updates that they've\n\n270\n00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.700\nbeen testing.\n\n271\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.420\nAnd then you have, again,\njust a patch in general.\n\n272\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:19.930\nAll right,\n\n273\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.580\nthey're all patches it just depends\nwhat is the criticality behind them.\n\n274\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.370\nI can always, if I wanted to,\nI could right click on this.\n\n275\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.109\nAnd I could hide this update if it happens\nto be something that maybe a language\n\n276\n00:15:33.109 --> 00:15:36.287\npackage that's in here, and\nI don't speak a certain language.\n\n277\n00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:39.783\nAnd it keeps showing up as an optional\nupdate, I could hide it if I wanted to.\n\n278\n00:15:39.783 --> 00:15:43.943\nI could always copy the details and\nthen I could paste it to a text document,\n\n279\n00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.538\nif I wanna read it for later.\n\n280\n00:15:45.538 --> 00:15:51.318\nA great thing is here they give me a lot\nof information about what this is.\n\n281\n00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:52.938\nAnd this happens to be a security issue,\nso\n\n282\n00:15:52.938 --> 00:15:54.920\nthis is one that we're\ndefinitely gonna wanna run.\n\n283\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.501\nAnd we can see when it was published and\n\n284\n00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:58.833\nalso lets us know that there\nmight be a pending restart.\n\n285\n00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.795\nIf we want additional information,\n\n286\n00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:04.477\nwe can always get that additional\ninformation likewise here, too.\n\n287\n00:16:04.477 --> 00:16:10.060\nAll right, now, that being said, let's go\nahead and let's check some other settings.\n\n288\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.790\nSo I could check for updates right here.\n\n289\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.780\nAnd I'm gonna save time on this one,\njust by skipping that for now.\n\n290\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.070\nI could change the settings, right?\n\n291\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.090\nAnd the settings dictate what happens,\nright?\n\n292\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.861\nWhen we're doing our patch management,\nwhat happens?\n\n293\n00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:26.390\nIn this case, recommended is to\ninstall updates automatically.\n\n294\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.410\nWe could say download those updates but\nwait till I'm there and\n\n295\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.280\nI can make a choice of which\nones I actually wanna install.\n\n296\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.590\nI could say, just pull down the list,\nshow me the list, and\n\n297\n00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.170\nthen I'll choose if I\nwanna download anything.\n\n298\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.570\nAnd then definitely not recommended\nis to never check for updates.\n\n299\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.100\nAgain this gives you the ability to do,\nhey, if it's recommended, go ahead and\n\n300\n00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.550\ngive me the recommended updates the same\nway I receive the critical ones, right?\n\n301\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.720\nSo if Microsoft is recommending that\nyou install these critical ones,\n\n302\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.260\nyou're gonna install.\n\n303\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.090\nBut if Microsoft is also recommending that\nyou install XYZ as well, go ahead and\n\n304\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.830\njust install them, too.\n\n305\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.968\nIf you end up having, and\nthis is about a privilege thing,\n\n306\n00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:10.518\nallow all users to install updates on this\ncomputer cuz typically we're not talking\n\n307\n00:17:10.518 --> 00:17:12.392\nabout third party software here.\n\n308\n00:17:12.392 --> 00:17:16.143\nWhat we're talking about are things\nthat make the operating system stable,\n\n309\n00:17:16.143 --> 00:17:20.410\nthat fix functionality flaws,\nbugs in the operating system, if you will.\n\n310\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.130\nNow if you're one that has line\nof business software, maybe for\n\n311\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.750\nsome of you home users out there, if you\ngot, for instance, the Office Suite.\n\n312\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.670\nWell, guess what?\n\n313\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.580\nYou don't have to go to\na second location and\n\n314\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.640\ninstall the Office Suite products updates,\ntoo.\n\n315\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.540\nGive me the updates for\nMicrosoft products and\n\n316\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.035\ncheck for optional Microsoft software\nwhen I check Windows Update.\n\n317\n00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes,\nwhile we're talking about updates,\n\n318\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.900\nI've dealt extensively with updates.\n\n319\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.937\nAnd as we've been saying\nthroughout the series,\n\n320\n00:17:47.937 --> 00:17:51.247\nwe don't wanna just give you the\ninformation that helps you pass the test.\n\n321\n00:17:51.247 --> 00:17:53.665\nWe wanna give you practical\ninformation that will help you\n\n322\n00:17:53.665 --> 00:17:55.305\nas a technician out in the wild.\n\n323\n00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:56.965\nYou're the guy, right?\n\n324\n00:17:56.965 --> 00:17:58.705\nThey called, help, please.\n\n325\n00:17:58.705 --> 00:18:00.796\nThere's some things you need to know\nabout updates that I've learned.\n\n326\n00:18:00.796 --> 00:18:02.167\nWell, I just wanna pass\nthat on to you guys.\n\n327\n00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:05.538\nI thought it'd just be good tidbits\nof stuff that can help you and\n\n328\n00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:07.410\nhelp your users.\n\n329\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.700\nIf they're not installing their updates,\nA, that's a security problem, right?\n\n330\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.890\nYou're open to security flaws and\nvulnerable to that.\n\n331\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.150\nBut B,\nit can actually slow down your computer.\n\n332\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.550\nYour computer will act like junk\nbecause it's sitting there going,\n\n333\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.730\nyou need to really install this.\n\n334\n00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.530\nI don't know why that happens.\n\n335\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.620\nBut in my experience,\n\n336\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.890\npeople with, especially a lot of updates\nthat they're waiting to install, for\n\n337\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.560\nsome reason, I've noticed that a lot of\nend users feel like updates break things.\n\n338\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.900\nSo they don't wanna install it and\nthey're gunshy about them.\n\n339\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.800\nSo if they have control over whether or\n\n340\n00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.440\nnot their updates get applied,\nthey won't do it.\n\n341\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.160\nAnd you'll see that\nlittle icon down there.\n\n342\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.850\nYou'll go to the Control Panel\nin the updates, there they are.\n\n343\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.812\nYou have like 200 updates waiting.\n\n344\n00:18:47.812 --> 00:18:48.900\nWhy aren't these being installed?\n\n345\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.730\nWell, they break things.\n\n346\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.400\nNow, here comes the rub, that can happen.\n\n347\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.750\nUpdates can actually break things.\n\n348\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.550\nSo I understand why they would\nbe cautious about that, but\n\n349\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.160\nyou can tell them, for\nthe most part, that does not occur.\n\n350\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.610\nThat's an exception to the rule and\nnot the rule, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.840\nSo it should be safe for\nthem to install updates.\n\n352\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.138\nAnd if it does break, we can go in, find\nout which update is causing the problem by\n\n353\n00:19:14.138 --> 00:19:17.428\nuninstalling them one at a time\nuntil the problem goes away and\n\n354\n00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:19.308\nthen we know which one it is.\n\n355\n00:19:19.308 --> 00:19:23.450\nReinstall the ones that weren't causing\nan issue and work with the one that does.\n\n356\n00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.560\nSo that is practical update management\nright there, patch management.\n\n357\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.530\nI ran WSUS servers for\na large company for many years and\n\n358\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.440\nI've dealt with updates a lot.\n\n359\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.591\nEven down at the home level working\nwith people at their home PC.\n\n360\n00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:38.190\nIt is something they get very afraid of.\n\n361\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.950\nSo you can help them guide the way, and\n\n362\n00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.630\nhave a secure system that is up to date\nwith their patches and running smoothly.\n\n363\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, now you wanna lift\nthe hood and look at the engine now?\n\n364\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.942\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you exactly why that can\n\n365\n00:19:49.942 --> 00:19:51.010\nspeed up your PC.\n\n366\n00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.590\nAll right, we have something out there\nknown as Windows Hardware Quality Labs.\n\n367\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.630\nAnd when a manufacturer goes to\nsubmit a driver to Microsoft for\n\n368\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.460\na product that they've designed,\nthey have to go through a pretty rigorous\n\n369\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.730\nprocess to ensure that it doesn't corrupt\nthe operating system, right, doesn't\n\n370\n00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.160\ncause the bugs that Dan's saying that\nit can in the past, it has in the past.\n\n371\n00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.550\nGot a lot better today that you don't\nhave to worry about that as much, and\n\n372\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.140\none of the reasons is because\nof the hardware quality labs.\n\n373\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.870\nSo what happens a lot of times is that a\ndriver can be installed that is a generic\n\n374\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.570\ndriver that Microsoft has embedded within\ntheir operating system at the time of\n\n375\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.400\ninstallation and it gives you the basic\nfunctionality of the device, all right?\n\n376\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.340\nLet's talk about having maybe\na four-barrel carburetor, right?\n\n377\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.300\nYou've got two barrels running right now.\n\n378\n00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.597\nBut then the moment the driver\nis submitted to Microsoft,\n\n379\n00:20:35.597 --> 00:20:37.083\nit is considered stable.\n\n380\n00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:40.217\nIt is digitally signed by Microsoft and\nit makes it into the updates,\n\n381\n00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:43.687\nit is from the manufacturer and gives\nthe full functionality of the drives.\n\n382\n00:20:43.687 --> 00:20:46.122\nNow we've opened up all carbs, right?\n\n383\n00:20:46.122 --> 00:20:47.866\nSo that's one of the reasons.\n\n384\n00:20:47.866 --> 00:20:52.130\nThe other thing is, is it can be software\nfunctionality, coding problems, right?\n\n385\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.920\nCuz they're always doing code revisions.\n\n386\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.790\nAnd they could find something\nin the code that says,\n\n387\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.520\nthat's not really running efficiently.\n\n388\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.550\nSo let's go ahead and let's update,\nlet's bring this update out, and\n\n389\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.610\nit makes more adequate\nuse of the resources.\n\n390\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.910\nSo I have seen that's where\ntimes that that has happened.\n\n391\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.753\nAnd I have to say I've also been,\nyou say that yes it can happen,\n\n392\n00:21:14.753 --> 00:21:18.094\nit can cause system instability problems.\n\n393\n00:21:18.094 --> 00:21:19.808\nI have been on the other\nside of the tracks there.\n\n394\n00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:21.440\nI've been there.\n\n395\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.945\nAnd the one time I had,\none time, only one time,\n\n396\n00:21:23.945 --> 00:21:27.861\nI ever had a problem with Windows Vista\nwas when I updated a video driver, and\n\n397\n00:21:27.861 --> 00:21:30.450\nit came from Windows Update and\nit locked me out.\n\n398\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.522\nI couldn't even get into\nthe recovery environment and\n\n399\n00:21:32.522 --> 00:21:34.691\nI essentially had to re-install\nthe operating system.\n\n400\n00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Wes, eight years of running updates in\na company with over 1,000 computers in it.\n\n401\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.690\nAnd I think we had four updates that\ncaused line of business issues.\n\n402\n00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.040\nNothing detrimental to the operating\nsystem like what you had.\n\n403\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.920\nI mean, that's an even more rare anomaly.\n\n404\n00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.560\nSo we had four updates that\nwe had to rollback, reinstall\n\n405\n00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.790\nthe others that were part of that package,\nand find out why that one wasn't working.\n\n406\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.106\nAnd we actually ended up, a couple of\nthem we submitted to Microsoft and\n\n407\n00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:03.887\nthe others that we had to fix\nour line of business software.\n\n408\n00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:07.280\nIt was on our end that\nthat was the problem.\n\n409\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.150\n&gt;&gt; And I wouldn't put it past that problem\nthat happened where I had to reinstall\n\n410\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.800\nthe operating system being\nuser error as well on my part.\n\n411\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.240\nI mean, honestly, cuz that's\nthe only time it's ever happened.\n\n412\n00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.918\nThe only other time I've ever had a really\nbad blue screen was in Windows 7 and\n\n413\n00:22:20.918 --> 00:22:24.427\nthat was because I was trying to do\nsomething that you really should only be\n\n414\n00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:27.048\ndoing on Linux, and\nit wasn't supported on Windows.\n\n415\n00:22:27.048 --> 00:22:30.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You tried to mix the chocolate\nand the peanut butter together.\n\n416\n00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:33.042\nAbsolutely, and\nwe need to leave that to Reese.\n\n417\n00:22:33.042 --> 00:22:34.420\nReese is the one that\nknows how to do that.\n\n418\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.183\n&gt;&gt; They're the professionals.\n\n419\n00:22:35.183 --> 00:22:36.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n420\n00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.880\nso again,\nthat was more user error on my part.\n\n421\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.130\nSo that's a great thing.\n\n422\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.050\nLet's go ahead and bump on over\nto our Windows 8.1 machine now.\n\n423\n00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.370\nSo we'll go ahead and\npull the charms menu out here.\n\n424\n00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.020\nOr there's a few different\nways that you can get to this.\n\n425\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:57.250\nYou can actually, if I remember right,\nwe can go here, and let's see.\n\n426\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.273\nWe'll do just Search,\nPC Settings, right, so\n\n427\n00:23:00.273 --> 00:23:02.947\na few different ways\nthat you can get to it.\n\n428\n00:23:02.947 --> 00:23:05.961\nBut we kinda wanna show you again in\nthe modern UI because it is different from\n\n429\n00:23:05.961 --> 00:23:07.810\nthe traditional control panel.\n\n430\n00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.200\nNotice that we have down here\nat the bottom Update and\n\n431\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.500\nrecovery, that's where we wanna be.\n\n432\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.380\nAnd then we have Windows Updates here.\n\n433\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.690\nAll right, now couple of\nthings that we can do, right?\n\n434\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.340\nThere aren't any updates download\nautomatically, right, but\n\n435\n00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.620\nwe could do things like\nviewing the update history.\n\n436\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.030\nAll right, and depending on what you've\nalready updated, we didn't do that in\n\n437\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.130\nWindows 7, but the interface looks like\nthe traditional control panel, right.\n\n438\n00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.920\nAnd we can see that these\nare successfully updated.\n\n439\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.660\nThese KBs,\nthese are called knowledge base and\n\n440\n00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.040\nMicrosoft has a running\ndatabase of the KBs.\n\n441\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.600\nWe call it the KB,\nthe knowledge base, hence,\n\n442\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.280\nKB, that you can look and you can find out\n\n443\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.830\ninformation related to whatever the update\nwas that you were going to install.\n\n444\n00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.250\nGo ahead and choose Back.\n\n445\n00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.313\nWe can also choose how\nupdates get installed.\n\n446\n00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:55.617\nKeep in mind you've probably\nseen something like this,\n\n447\n00:23:55.617 --> 00:23:57.490\nthat we just showed you in Windows 7,\nright?\n\n448\n00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.761\nWe have the Install updates.\n\n449\n00:23:58.761 --> 00:24:00.350\nDownload, but let me choose.\n\n450\n00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.000\nCheck for updates, but let me choose\nwhen to download and install them.\n\n451\n00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.613\nBasically show me the list.\n\n452\n00:24:05.613 --> 00:24:07.577\nOr never update at all.\n\n453\n00:24:07.577 --> 00:24:09.212\nSame thing with Microsoft Update.\n\n454\n00:24:09.212 --> 00:24:12.838\nRemember, we talked about if you\nhave other Microsoft products we can\n\n455\n00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:16.260\npull those down with\nWindows Update likewise too.\n\n456\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.450\nNow let me go ahead.\n\n457\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.900\nI'm gonna live dangerously here.\n\n458\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.297\nAnd we'll go ahead.\nAnd we'll see if any updates come up.\n\n459\n00:24:22.297 --> 00:24:24.260\nI do want to talk about-\n&gt;&gt; Evel Knievel cape on.\n\n460\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.680\n&gt;&gt; And it looks like we have, exactly.\n\n461\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.860\nLooks like we are up to date.\n\n462\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.600\nSo that's a great thing.\n\n463\n00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.337\nRemember we could do\nthings like driver and\n\n464\n00:24:30.337 --> 00:24:32.430\nfirmware updates through this location.\n\n465\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.120\nThe other thing to keep in mind\nis that we have several tools.\n\n466\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.040\nSome of them we've already talked about,\nright?\n\n467\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.510\nBack up, we've seen Back Up and\nRestore Center, we've seen File History.\n\n468\n00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.630\nSystem Restore is another\none out there too, remember,\n\n469\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:50.670\nany time you install a driver,\nyou install some kind of application.\n\n470\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:55.820\nAnd you wanna make sure\nthat you can uninstall it,\n\n471\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.690\nessentially, if it becomes problematic.\n\n472\n00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.190\nOr roll your computer back\nto an earlier configuration.\n\n473\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.645\nYou can always go into Control Panel.\n\n474\n00:25:02.645 --> 00:25:07.458\nYou can go into System and Security,\nthey both apply here.If you are talking\n\n475\n00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:11.495\nabout things like Vista,Windows 7 and\nWindows 8 and 8.1.\n\n476\n00:25:11.495 --> 00:25:16.410\nA we can go to system,and then\ninside of the system control panel,\n\n477\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.925\nwe can choose system protection here.\n\n478\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.600\nAnd inside of the System Protection,\n\n479\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.710\nonce it shows up here we'll have,\nwell, essentially, System Restore.\n\n480\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.430\nAnd we can always restore\nby starting this wizard.\n\n481\n00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.760\nWe can restore to\nan earlier point in time.\n\n482\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.510\nYou can see that here's a Windows update.\n\n483\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.940\nThis was a critical update that\nwas installed, shows me the time.\n\n484\n00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.490\nIt created this automatically.\n\n485\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.610\nThere are other restore points too.\n\n486\n00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.747\nAutomatic restore point that happens.\n\n487\n00:25:42.747 --> 00:25:47.403\nOne that's known as the initial system\ncheck point, once I install the operating\n\n488\n00:25:47.403 --> 00:25:52.263\nsystem before I go any farther with post\ninstallations configurations, third party\n\n489\n00:25:52.263 --> 00:25:57.018\ndriver installations, it goes ahead and\nit creates one automatically there too.\n\n490\n00:25:57.018 --> 00:26:00.670\nSo you can choose to do the system\nrestore here as well if\n\n491\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.550\nyour system never becomes problematic.\n\n492\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.260\nThe other thing, too, is that you can\ncreate the recovery image, right?\n\n493\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.396\nThey call it on the objectives,\nthey call it the recovery image.\n\n494\n00:26:09.396 --> 00:26:14.480\nBut we've seen in Windows\n7 here that it's actually,\n\n495\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.650\nit is a recovery image if you will.\n\n496\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.530\nBut there are two different kinds right?\n\n497\n00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.800\nThere's a system image which is a file by\nfile snapshot of the hard drive that I can\n\n498\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.130\napply to this hard drive if operating\nsystem needs to be restored in anyway.\n\n499\n00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.815\nYou could technically called\nthe system repair disk or\n\n500\n00:26:32.815 --> 00:26:36.535\nrecovery image as well because it has\nthe Windows pre installation environment.\n\n501\n00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:41.435\nWhich is a small footprint memory resonant\noperating system, it includes the repair\n\n502\n00:26:41.435 --> 00:26:44.840\ntools that you need and that's called\nWindows Recovery Environments.\n\n503\n00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.050\nSo technically it is a recovery image,\nif you will.\n\n504\n00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.320\nLast hand full of disk maintenance\nutilities that we kind of just got\n\n505\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.610\nto just recap here.\n\n506\n00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.780\nRemember there's disk management.\n\n507\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.180\nDisk management again you can get\nto it through computer management.\n\n508\n00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.270\nAgain, I'm just pushing start, right\nclicking on computer, choosing manage.\n\n509\n00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:08.200\nAnd then inside of Computer Management,\nyou have Disk Management.\n\n510\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.450\nGreat thing about Windows 8.1 is\nif you are on the desktop, well,\n\n511\n00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.130\nyou really could be on the modern or\nmetro UI as well.\n\n512\n00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.680\nYou right click on the Windows tile there,\nDisk Management is actually in\n\n513\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.120\nthe administrative list here, so we could\nalso bring up Disk Management here.\n\n514\n00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.549\nSome of the other ones that we have,\nwe diskpart, remember that\n\n515\n00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:31.740\ndiskpart is a really is a utility\nthat allows you to do the same thing\n\n516\n00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.610\nthat disk management does but it allows\nyou to do it from the command prompt.\n\n517\n00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.838\nSo we can do diskpart here.\n\n518\n00:27:37.838 --> 00:27:40.700\nNotice that diskpart allows\nme to do things like\n\n519\n00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.720\nlist the disks that are in the operating\nsystem including partitions and volumes.\n\n520\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.830\nAlso we have things like check disk that\nwe've shown you in other episodes too,\n\n521\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.380\nso do go back and\ncheck some of those other episodes.\n\n522\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.250\nI've shown you in the graphical\nuser interface, even in this show.\n\n523\n00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.590\nSystem file checker we've talked\nabout sometimes just called SFC.\n\n524\n00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.130\nAnd again remember SFC\nallows me to do scans.\n\n525\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.310\nAnd you know what I gotta get\na diskpart because I'm technically not\n\n526\n00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.990\nin command prompt when I'm in diskpart.\n\n527\n00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:15.730\nI can run SFC system file checker and\n\n528\n00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.370\nI can do a scan of the system files,\n\n529\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.030\nI can verify them, we can also try to\ncorrect things that are wrong with them.\n\n530\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.248\nNotice it scans the integrity\nof all protected system files.\n\n531\n00:28:26.248 --> 00:28:31.390\nThat's important to understanding system\nfiles vs regular files and folders.\n\n532\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.250\nRegular files and folders are where\nwe store our information as users.\n\n533\n00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.020\nSystems files or directories if you will,\nare where the operating system stores\n\n534\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.330\nthe files and folders that it needs\nto function on a daily basis.\n\n535\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.440\n&gt;&gt; Wes, is that the thing that's\nalways yelling at me when I start\n\n536\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.502\nmy computer up and,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n537\n00:28:44.502 --> 00:28:45.605\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Says that you need,\n\n538\n00:28:45.605 --> 00:28:46.745\nI'm like just forget that.\n\n539\n00:28:46.745 --> 00:28:49.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, yeah,\n\n540\n00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.923\ndon't do that.\n\n541\n00:28:49.923 --> 00:28:51.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a joke.\n\n542\n00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n543\n00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.790\n&gt;&gt; We talked about disk defragmentor and\n\n544\n00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.930\ndisk optimizer drive optimizers\nthey call it in Windows 8.1.\n\n545\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.000\nI will tell you one of the last ones and\n\n546\n00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.310\nI did mention this in another if we could\ncheck out the screen here,defrag.exe,\n\n547\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.930\nis also there and again this is more of\nthe cmd line interface to do this and-\n\n548\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.580\n&gt;&gt; Give you that little bit more power.\n\n549\n00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.110\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely you need\na little bit more power and\n\n550\n00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.910\nyou don't have that button in the GUI\nthis is the way that you can do it.\n\n551\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.940\nSo a lot of different stuff\nthat you can do inside\n\n552\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.330\nof updating your operating system.\n\n553\n00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.320\nThere is one last thing that they\ncall out that can be integrated\n\n554\n00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.740\ninside of your Windows update, and\nin fact we've kind of seen this already.\n\n555\n00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.570\nThey talk about anti-virus and\nanti-malware updates.\n\n556\n00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.530\nLet me go ahead and in fact I think\ngot it still here in the background.\n\n557\n00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.780\nYeah, let's go back to update and\nrecovery real quick because well,\n\n558\n00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.380\nthis is on the exam.\n\n559\n00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.420\nBut it's kind of bundled\ntogether with your Windows update\n\n560\n00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.370\nif you're using third party\nsoftware go to manufacturer, right?\n\n561\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.390\nBut this is where we could show you\nnotice that definition updates of\n\n562\n00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.220\nWindows Defenders.\n\n563\n00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.630\nSo that is built right in and\n\n564\n00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.580\nit says, install this update to revise the\ndefinition files that are used to detect\n\n565\n00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.670\nviruses, spyware, and\nother potentially unwanted software.\n\n566\n00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.850\n&gt;&gt; That sounds are a good thing.\n\n567\n00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:03.562\n&gt;&gt; It is right?\n\n568\n00:30:03.562 --> 00:30:05.252\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So this is the combination of\n\n569\n00:30:05.252 --> 00:30:08.556\nthe anti-virus and anti malware\nupdates that you can run likewise, so\n\n570\n00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:10.820\na lot of different utilities.\n\n571\n00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.750\nDan's mentioned it already this\nisn't just about what's on the exam,\n\n572\n00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.550\nsome of the piece of advice that we gave\nyou for the real world is something that\n\n573\n00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.832\nyou're gonna wanna use to make sure\nthat your systems stay online.\n\n574\n00:30:20.832 --> 00:30:24.480\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, did a fantastic\njob running us through all the cool\n\n575\n00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.740\nlittle gidgets and gadgets that they give\nus inside of the Windows operating system.\n\n576\n00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.370\nYou bought the OS,\nyou bought the whole thing,\n\n577\n00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.950\nyou might as well use it all, right.\n\n578\n00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.490\nSo jump in there, try to figure out how\nto use each one of these tools to your\n\n579\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:40.270\nadvantage so that we can keep our systems\npeaked and tweaked into an optimal state.\n\n580\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.070\nWes, we do appreciate\nyou dropping by today.\n\n581\n00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.020\nWe appreciate our good audience there for\nwatching.\n\n582\n00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.120\nWe hope you enjoyed it.\n\n583\n00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.530\nBut it's time for us to sign off.\n\n584\n00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.880\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n585\n00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n586\n00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.803\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n587\n00:30:51.803 --> 00:30:57.839\n[MUSIC]\n\n588\n00:30:57.839 -->

00:00:08.276\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:11.945\nYou're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.215\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:16.063\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:17.634\nI'm your host today, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:21.428\nAnd in todays episode,\nwe are looking at more in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:24.073\n22902 for those keeping score at home.\n\n10\n00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:26.085\nJoining us back in the studio,\nyet again, and\n\n11\n00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.296\nlending his expertise to us on that topic,\nmy good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.559\nWes, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:31.860\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.828\nGreat to be here, and that's right,\nwhile we're diving into\n\n15\n00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:38.468\nother operating systems today, and\nI'm kind of glad I've got Dan with me and\n\n16\n00:00:38.468 --> 00:00:40.826\nlet’s see which side of\nthe river we're on here.\n\n17\n00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad I've got Dan with me because\n\n18\n00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.781\nwell, one of the operating\nsystems we're gonna talk about,\n\n19\n00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:45.918\nhe's got a lot of experience.\n\n20\n00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:48.862\nSo usually you're like,\nglad to have you here.\n\n21\n00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:52.166\nWell, I'm actually glad to have Dan here\ntoday helping out in this one cuz we're\n\n22\n00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.516\ngonna be talking about well,\nthe Mac Operating System.\n\n23\n00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:58.479\nOne of the things that they call out and\nit's so good see.\n\n24\n00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.193\nIn the earlier days of the A Plus,\neverything would be Windows.\n\n25\n00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:05.318\nThat’s about all you would ever see was\njust the Windows Operating Systems but\n\n26\n00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.206\nlet's face it.\n\n27\n00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:11.413\nWhile Windows does still have a very large\nmarket share when it comes to enterprise\n\n28\n00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:16.093\nenvironment, you're seeing a lot more\npopularity and really good bit of\n\n29\n00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:21.401\npopularity in the Mac operating system,\nand then well, Linux operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:25.219\nAnd when it comes down to it, a lot of\npeople might be running Linux in a lot of\n\n31\n00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.327\ndifferent applications, and\nthey don't even realize it.\n\n32\n00:01:28.327 --> 00:01:33.139\nA lot of your devices that are out there,\neven small miniature devices, IoT devices.\n\n33\n00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:36.311\nEven your smart TV is probably\nrunning some kernel in Linux and\n\n34\n00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:37.898\nmaybe you didn't realize it.\n\n35\n00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.985\nSo, it's really good to see.\n\n36\n00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:42.715\nNow the fact that we will be\ntalking a little bit about\n\n37\n00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:44.275\nthe Linux Operating System.\n\n38\n00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:49.368\nNow I do want you to understand that they\ndon't really put a lot of emphasis on Mac\n\n39\n00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:54.245\nor Linux in the A plus, but there are some\nbasics that you need to be aware of.\n\n40\n00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:57.943\nAnd that's what we hope to familiarize\nyou with in this episode here.\n\n41\n00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:02.551\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes, the open source community\nand the Linux community specifically have\n\n42\n00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.357\nreally made a concerted effort to\nget more into the desktop arena and\n\n43\n00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:08.381\nhave more of a say in that spectrum.\n\n44\n00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:12.125\nSo they've really come out with some\nreally cool desktop operating systems.\n\n45\n00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.605\nI know Ubuntu is very popular with\nit's Unity desktop, people love that.\n\n46\n00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.451\nThe Zorn OS, elementary, you name it,\nthere's a bunch of them out there that\n\n47\n00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:22.833\nare really geared specifically toward\nthe end user, the home user so\n\n48\n00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.549\nthat they can start having\na Linux experience as well.\n\n49\n00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.256\nThat coupled with the open source\ncommunity trying to also help out\n\n50\n00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:33.426\nwith that, making software that end\nusers and not necessarily business or\n\n51\n00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.717\nserver people would want or care about.\n\n52\n00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:39.184\nBut someone that at home wanting to\nget into an Internet experience have\n\n53\n00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:41.324\nthat sweet software that\nthey're used to and\n\n54\n00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:43.592\nmore traditional Windows\nmaybe environment.\n\n55\n00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:46.677\nThey're just trying to pull their\nboot straps up and go, you know what,\n\n56\n00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.459\nwe’re really kind of lagging over here.\n\n57\n00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.921\nLet's take charge and get at it.\n\n58\n00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.645\n&gt;&gt; And let's go ahead and even though it's\nnot in the objectives, in other episodes,\n\n59\n00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:57.054\nwe have talked about the difference\nbetween a proprietary based software and\n\n60\n00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:58.168\nopen sourced software.\n\n61\n00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:01.273\nSo Dan, I'm glad you mentioned that\nbecause it's not in the objectives, and\n\n62\n00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:04.397\nI kind of almost forgot about it, that's\nwhy I said I'm glad to have Dan here.\n\n63\n00:03:04.397 --> 00:03:06.114\nGot my back sir.\n\n64\n00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:07.870\nLet's talk about proprietary.\n\n65\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.142\nProprietary means\na copyright you might hear.\n\n66\n00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:13.282\nThat means a single company,\nthey own the rights to it.\n\n67\n00:03:13.282 --> 00:03:16.696\nIt's also called closed sources,\nopposite of open source.\n\n68\n00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:20.763\nAnd that just means that without reverse\nengineering, which would be copyright\n\n69\n00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:24.612\ninfringement, you're not allowed to\nget in there, see what's going on.\n\n70\n00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:27.997\nYou're not allowed to get in there and\nduplicate it, if you will, make changes,\n\n71\n00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:30.464\nand then repackage it and\nrebrand it off and sell somebody.\n\n72\n00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:35.227\nIt's basically intellectual property of\na specific company versus open source.\n\n73\n00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:38.423\nOpen source software is a little\nbit different in the fact that\n\n74\n00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:42.786\nthe Richard Stallman, which is primarily\nconsidered like the godfather if you will\n\n75\n00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:47.041\nof the initial open source movement,\ncalls it and coined the phrase, copy left.\n\n76\n00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:50.257\nAnd it just means that the code is\nfreely available for you to look at.\n\n77\n00:03:50.257 --> 00:03:52.454\nAnd in fact, you can look at it.\n\n78\n00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:53.350\nYou can modify it.\n\n79\n00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.067\nYou can make changes to it.\n\n80\n00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.179\nAnd then you can freely redistribute it.\n\n81\n00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:01.532\nNow understand that open source does have\nsome things that you gotta be careful.\n\n82\n00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:06.486\nIt doesn't mean that just every part of\nopen source software is gonna be free.\n\n83\n00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:09.634\nIn fact, Dan corrected me on something\nthat I was talking about cuz I'm I'm so\n\n84\n00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:10.502\nused to saying okay.\n\n85\n00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:12.098\nWell third party software, right?\n\n86\n00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:14.630\nThat just means you go\noutside of Linux but Dan,\n\n87\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.112\nyou mentioned before we even talked,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:17.112 --> 00:04:21.073\nThe Linux kernal is really what's open\nsource and then all these pieces that we\n\n89\n00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:24.736\nadd to it after the fact when you\nmentioned different distros and stuff,\n\n90\n00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:27.879\nthat's really controlled by\na specific community, right?\n\n91\n00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI mean they can be open source as well.\n\n92\n00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.291\nThey can use that copy\nleft if they feel like it.\n\n93\n00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:36.838\nTypically you'll see if there's\nthe GNU licensing, right?\n\n94\n00:04:36.838 --> 00:04:40.067\nGNU's not Unix which is\nanother recursive acronym.\n\n95\n00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:43.770\nYou'll see this is a lot in the open\nsource community, they're fun but\n\n96\n00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.800\nbasically Linux is controlled by people\nthat create the Linux term, right?\n\n97\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.304\nThis is Linux.\n\n98\n00:04:49.304 --> 00:04:53.695\nEverything else that goes on top of that,\nall the cool tools that are built into it,\n\n99\n00:04:53.695 --> 00:04:58.023\nthat's somebody going, I want to make\na distribution, and I want to have tool X,\n\n100\n00:04:58.023 --> 00:05:01.157\nY and Z, so I'm gonna bundle\nthat on top of my Linux kernel,\n\n101\n00:05:01.157 --> 00:05:03.089\nwhich I get open-source rom them.\n\n102\n00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:05.820\nNow, the creator of the tool,\ncould be a closed-source tool.\n\n103\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.164\nCould be an open-source tool.\n\n104\n00:05:07.164 --> 00:05:09.155\nIf it is open-source,\nwe've got access to it.\n\n105\n00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:11.356\nWe'll look at it, otherwise it will\nbe just like any other software.\n\n106\n00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:13.240\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and you mentioned GNU.\n\n107\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.652\nGNU first started,\nyou know GPL is the GNU public licensing.\n\n108\n00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:21.975\nIn fact, I went ahead and brought that up\nas we're explaining in the background,\n\n109\n00:05:21.975 --> 00:05:25.187\nthat this is the GNU or\ngeneral public -GNU public license.\n\n110\n00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:26.627\nBoy those acronyms are confusing right?\n\n111\n00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:27.395\n&gt;&gt; They love them.\n\n112\n00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:29.112\n&gt;&gt; But notice who is controlling this.\n\n113\n00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.064\nWindows is controlled by Microsoft.\n\n114\n00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.828\nIt gives proprietary, you're not going to\ncopy their software and get away with it\n\n115\n00:05:34.828 --> 00:05:37.840\nwithout some kind of violation of\nan end user license agreement and\n\n116\n00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.105\ncopyright infringement.\n\n117\n00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.433\nHowever, when you're using\nthings that fall under the GNU,\n\n118\n00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:46.156\nor the GPL, more specifically,\nright, you are bound to a license.\n\n119\n00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:49.841\nBut notice what it says,\nit's the Free Software Foundation, so\n\n120\n00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.183\njust keep that in mind.\n\n121\n00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:55.351\nA lot of times what you'll find is that\nin these open source based distros,\n\n122\n00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.810\nin Linux, they call them distros, right?\n\n123\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.156\nWe call them versions of Windows,\nand within each version of Windows,\n\n124\n00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:02.562\nwe have different editions.\n\n125\n00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.731\nThe different flavors of\nthe Linux operating system,\n\n126\n00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.909\nwe're really talking about distributions,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.527\nNow, please understand that one of the\nthings that you'll notice a lot of times\n\n128\n00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:11.553\nwith distributions,\n\n129\n00:06:11.553 --> 00:06:14.632\nis where they're gonna get you if\nthey do wanna make money off of it.\n\n130\n00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:17.037\nSay, they make money off of support,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:17.037 --> 00:06:19.422\nIf you think about it,\nif I buy a Windows operating system,\n\n132\n00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:22.665\none of the things that I typically do not\nhave to do after I purchased, and again,\n\n133\n00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:23.929\nthrough legal means, right?\n\n134\n00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:25.586\nWe've purchased the Windows\noperating system.\n\n135\n00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.748\nOr maybe you didn't purchase\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n136\n00:06:27.748 --> 00:06:29.184\nMaybe you bought the hardware already.\n\n137\n00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:31.901\nIt had the operating system pre-loaded.\n\n138\n00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:35.442\nTypically, don't have to pay for\nupdates after that, right?\n\n139\n00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:37.319\nI don't really have to pay for\n\n140\n00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.361\na lot of additional things that are gonna\nbe supported in the operating system.\n\n141\n00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:46.068\nThere could be a potential that if you\ndo have different distributions of\n\n142\n00:06:46.068 --> 00:06:50.035\nLINUX flavors, that you might end up\nhaving to pay for the long time support.\n\n143\n00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:53.821\nNow, not saying that that's everything,\nbut if you look at something like Red Hat.\n\n144\n00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:56.828\nRed Hat,\nit’s a LINUX based distribution, but\n\n145\n00:06:56.828 --> 00:07:01.737\nit is an enterprise level operating\nsystem, and they do make some good, pretty\n\n146\n00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:06.600\ndecent monies, pretty big foundation for\nthe support that they provide for.\n\n147\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.517\nBecause of the fact that the stability and\n\n148\n00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:11.912\na lot of the resource that they put in\nto making sure that that distribution\n\n149\n00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:15.168\nmaintain the stability instead of\nan enterprise level environment.\n\n150\n00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.454\nNow that's a little bit about the Linux\noperating system and we could go even\n\n151\n00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:21.501\nfurther, we could talk about\nLinus Torvalds, I mean for a bit there.\n\n152\n00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:24.683\nLinus Torvalds was\nthe inventor of Linux and\n\n153\n00:07:24.683 --> 00:07:30.192\nhe liked Unix in back I wanna say 91,\nlate 80s he was in college, right.\n\n154\n00:07:30.192 --> 00:07:33.531\nHe was operating I think on a Sun Solaris,\n\n155\n00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:37.546\nSun micro systems based\nUnix operating systems.\n\n156\n00:07:37.546 --> 00:07:40.767\nAnd he loved it so\nmuch that he wanted his own.\n\n157\n00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:45.370\nHe wanted his own, and there was a lot\nof PC devices in his native country but\n\n158\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.891\nthere wasn't a lot of support for\nPC in general, right?\n\n159\n00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.123\n&gt;&gt; Well plus those UNIX style operating\nsystems are extremely expensive.\n\n160\n00:07:53.123 --> 00:07:57.332\nSo expensive that they're basically out of\nthe hands of anybody that wants to play\n\n161\n00:07:57.332 --> 00:07:58.313\nwith them at home.\n\n162\n00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:00.604\nSo he was like,\nhow do we solve this problem?\n\n163\n00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:05.120\nWhat if I wrote an operating system that\nwas very similar in the way UNIX works?\n\n164\n00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.231\nBut was freely available.\n\n165\n00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:08.731\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it too Dan,\n\n166\n00:08:08.731 --> 00:08:13.233\nbecause he mentioned that to buy one of\nthose Sun Microsystems-based Unix systems,\n\n167\n00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:17.750\nyou were talking about 5 to $7,000, and\nagain, that gets kind of expensive.\n\n168\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.720\nAnd one of the ways, I believe, and\ntake this with a grain of salt, but\n\n169\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.760\none of the ways I believe that his\nuniversity would get around it\n\n170\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.170\nis the fact that they would let 14 or\nhowever many people use it in the morning.\n\n171\n00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.660\nAnd then in the evening classes,\nthey would use again 14 people,\n\n172\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.780\nyou log into it.\n\n173\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.510\nNow, that begs, what do you mean,\n14 people using an operating system?\n\n174\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:42.170\nWell, this is where Unix-based operating\nsystems, which essentially Mac OS even,\n\n175\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.550\nand Linux operating systems are the\nderivatives of the earliest Unix operating\n\n176\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.850\nsystem that came out from Bell\nlaboratories in the late 60's.\n\n177\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.650\nIs that it is a true\nmulti-user operating system.\n\n178\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.880\nAll right, now what I mean by multi-user,\nyou might say, well, wait second, Wes.\n\n179\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.445\nI've got a Windows machine, and\nI've got a user account on it for\n\n180\n00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.937\nmy wife, for myself, for my kids.\n\n181\n00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:11.100\nI've got three kids, and each one of\nthem have an account, it's multi-user.\n\n182\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.280\nWell yes, but\n\n183\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.000\nI want you to think about how each\nuser has to use the operating system.\n\n184\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.815\nWhat do I have to do?\n\n185\n00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:21.270\nI have to log out and\nthen the other user logs in, right?\n\n186\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.340\nAnd then they take control\nover their desktop.\n\n187\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.350\nBut what we don't have Is multiple people\nlogging into the same system at the same\n\n188\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.470\ntime, using their own desktop\nsimultaneously, that's multi-user.\n\n189\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.340\nAnd that's one of the characteristics\nof a Unix operating system\n\n190\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.425\nthat definitely differs differs\nfrom the Windows environment.\n\n191\n00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:42.585\nIs the fact that you can have\na single piece of hardware, and\n\n192\n00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:46.165\neach user can connect to that hardware and\n\n193\n00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:50.127\nrun their own isolated environment, have\ntheir own applications that are running.\n\n194\n00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:53.515\nAgain, a little bit different than what we\nthink of when we think of in the Windows\n\n195\n00:09:53.515 --> 00:09:55.235\noperating system.\n\n196\n00:09:55.235 --> 00:09:57.335\nNow the other thing I want you to\nknow a little bit about is the Mac\n\n197\n00:09:57.335 --> 00:09:58.155\noperating system.\n\n198\n00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:01.630\nNow the Mac operating system I\nbelieve is BSD under the hood, right?\n\n199\n00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.710\nIt's the Univ based derivative again, and\n\n200\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.740\nit follows the Unix flavor\nunderneath the hood.\n\n201\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.230\n&gt;&gt; It is a Unix operating system.\n\n202\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.890\n&gt;&gt; It is a Unix system,\nI think it was called-\n\n203\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Darwin now.\n\n204\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.484\n&gt;&gt; Darwin, that's right.\n&gt;&gt; That's just what it is,\n\n205\n00:10:13.484 --> 00:10:16.263\ncame out of BSD,\nwhich BSD is Berkeley Unix.\n\n206\n00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:17.235\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n207\n00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:18.756\n&gt;&gt; And it's just a free version of it.\n\n208\n00:10:18.756 --> 00:10:22.430\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and that's right,\nthe Darwin source code, that's right.\n\n209\n00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.580\nSo understand that the Mac OS,\n\n210\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.180\nif you will, is a proprietary\noperating system likewise.\n\n211\n00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.640\nIt doesn't follow the Linux GPL, so\nplease understand there's a distinction,\n\n212\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.050\neven though they both\nhave their earliest DNA.\n\n213\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.330\nTheir DNA, if you will,\ndoes come out of the Unix flavors, now.\n\n214\n00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.020\nSo that's a little bit about the two\ndifferent operating systems, and\n\n215\n00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.970\nkind of a little walk down memory lane,\na little bit of history behind it.\n\n216\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.750\nAgain, you guys that wanna learn\na little bit more about it,\n\n217\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.530\njust go look at the history of\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak,\n\n218\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.570\nthe original founders of Apple,\nand you can learn a lot about it.\n\n219\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.710\nThey were students, and\n\n220\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.270\nin fact they talked about seeing one of\nthe very first graphical user interfaces.\n\n221\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:03.890\nAnd believe it or\n\n222\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.770\nnot, prior to even Windows doing their\ndesktop manager back in the early days.\n\n223\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.940\nAnd they had seen one that was wrapped\naround a BSD system, they kinda knew\n\n224\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.000\nthat's the way the future was going, and\nlearn a little bit about Linus Torvalds.\n\n225\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.836\nHowever, understand I'm\ngonna kinda differ, and\n\n226\n00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:18.461\nI'm going to get out of\nthe history part of it,\n\n227\n00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:20.854\nbecause I don't know that it's gonna\nhelp you too much on the exam.\n\n228\n00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:23.540\nAnd that's what we want to\nbenefit you here at ITProTV.\n\n229\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.102\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into some of the objectives.\n\n230\n00:11:27.102 --> 00:11:32.111\nNow I'm gonna kind of move back and\nforth between our Ubuntu operating system,\n\n231\n00:11:32.111 --> 00:11:36.460\nand I'm gonna move back and\nforth between our Mac operating system.\n\n232\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.452\nNow one of the first things that they\ncall out Is backing up your operating\n\n233\n00:11:40.452 --> 00:11:41.440\nsystem, right?\n\n234\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.910\nThey talk about scheduled backups.\n\n235\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.785\nNow I was talking to Dan about this\nbefore, and Dan, you mentioned\n\n236\n00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:48.820\na common backup for the Linux operating\nsystem, what was that one called?\n\n237\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's called Bacula,\nthat's very popular, it's graphical based.\n\n238\n00:11:52.326 --> 00:11:54.139\nSo a lot of people like that,\nespecially for\n\n239\n00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:56.202\ncoming over from a Windows\nserver type of system.\n\n240\n00:11:56.202 --> 00:11:59.736\nYou still like to have the,\nplus it's very robust solution.\n\n241\n00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:02.995\nVery, very common, Bacula, so just\ncheck that out, you can Google that and\n\n242\n00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:04.112\nsee what's up with that.\n\n243\n00:12:04.112 --> 00:12:07.320\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and what I did is I went ahead,\nand you can see on our screen right here.\n\n244\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.735\nI went to the Ubuntu documentation here,\nbecause you'll see\n\n245\n00:12:10.735 --> 00:12:14.882\nthat there are a bunch of different\npossibilities that you have out there.\n\n246\n00:12:14.882 --> 00:12:18.132\nIn fact, they'll give you some\ninformation on backing up and\n\n247\n00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:20.720\nthe back up utilities that you have there.\n\n248\n00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.710\nAnd Dan mentioned graphical, right?\n\n249\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.360\nUnderstand that that's one of\nthe big differences, if you will,\n\n250\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.930\nbetween our Linux operating systems and\nreally when it comes to Windows.\n\n251\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.420\nNow, both of them have graphical user\ninterfaces, as you're gonna see, so\n\n252\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.100\ndoes Ubuntu.\n\n253\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.630\nBut they also have a lot of command line\ndriven stuff there, and a lot of Linux\n\n254\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.400\nusers prefer the command line because\nthere's a lot more power in it.\n\n255\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.227\nYou have a lot more access to\nthe operating system rather than some of\n\n256\n00:12:43.227 --> 00:12:44.027\nthe limitations.\n\n257\n00:12:44.027 --> 00:12:47.627\nThat if the developer of the software\ndoesn't put that little function in there\n\n258\n00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:50.437\nbecause they don't have that\nbutton that you can click on it.\n\n259\n00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:55.215\nSo you do have, again,\ndepending on your level of expertise,\n\n260\n00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:58.740\nif you will,\nyou do have command line driven.\n\n261\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.544\nKeep in mind, just like in the Windows\ncommand prompt or PowerShell,\n\n262\n00:13:02.544 --> 00:13:06.790\nit's text-based input and\ntext-based output, and syntax matters.\n\n263\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.550\nAs you guys can see, that would challenge\nsomebody like Wes who can't type to save\n\n264\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.000\ntheir life [LAUGH] for sure.\n\n265\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.426\nSo these are some of the options\nthat you have, right?\n\n266\n00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:17.840\nAnd I don't know that they're going to\ncall out, and in fact, did Bacula come up?\n\n267\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.555\nIt sure did, look at that, Dan, very good.\n\n268\n00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:22.634\nSo that's right there in the list,\nso thanks for that one too.\n\n269\n00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:25.630\nAnd you can see this one, again,\nit's got a command line so\n\n270\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.850\nyou can script it if you need to.\n\n271\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:33.045\nAnd you can schedule it, right,\nas well as a graphical user interface.\n\n272\n00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.816\nNow let's go ahead, and\nwhat we're going to do is,\n\n273\n00:13:34.816 --> 00:13:36.520\nwe're gonna switch over\nto the Mac environment.\n\n274\n00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.430\nNow the Mac environment also has their\nbackup utilities that you can use\n\n275\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.380\nlikewise, right?\n\n276\n00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.170\nSo if I switch over to the desktop here,\nand\n\n277\n00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.190\nthere's a couple of different\nways that you can get to this.\n\n278\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.623\nYou can go up to the Help menu bar at the\ntop, and you can click Go, if you will.\n\n279\n00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:57.720\nAnd then you can scroll down, and\nI believe you'll see this in Applications.\n\n280\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.549\nWhen Applications comes up, if we scroll\ndown, there is a little button here,\n\n281\n00:14:03.549 --> 00:14:09.385\nor a little application called Time\nMachine, and if I want, I can launch that.\n\n282\n00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:11.408\nNow Time Machine, in order to use it,\n\n283\n00:14:11.408 --> 00:14:14.230\nyou have to have a backup\ndrive configured, right?\n\n284\n00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.310\nWell, I've got a backup drive here,\nbut I don't have it plugged in.\n\n285\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.730\nAll right, so\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n286\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.805\nLet's go ahead, and\nlet me cancel out of this, and\n\n287\n00:14:21.805 --> 00:14:24.905\nit should cancel the whole application,\nand that's all right.\n\n288\n00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:30.970\nBut what I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo is I'm gonna plug in my drive.\n\n289\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.050\nAll right, now depending on how you have\nto set up, you have to keep in mind that,\n\n290\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.500\nyes you can schedule backups.\n\n291\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.340\nAll right, and that's really depending\non how you have Time Machine set up.\n\n292\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.140\nNow you can also set up\nTime Machine up in your Help menu,\n\n293\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.360\nup here, the Help menu bar up here,\nand that's what I've done.\n\n294\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.429\nYou can see this little clock right here,\nand if I click on it you could see,\n\n295\n00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:56.732\nit can tell me what's the last\ntime I've used Time Machine.\n\n296\n00:14:56.732 --> 00:15:00.527\nIf I want to back up now, right,\nif I wanna enter Time Machine, or\n\n297\n00:15:00.527 --> 00:15:03.290\nif I want to open\nthe Time Machine Preferences.\n\n298\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.880\nAnd we'll go ahead and do this so\nyou could actually see\n\n299\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.810\nwhat the Time Machine application would\nlook like if you were to watch it.\n\n300\n00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.510\nKeep in mind,\nif you don't have it connected to your\n\n301\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.160\nbackup drive set and connect.\n\n302\n00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.260\nWell, let me jump back on that one.\n\n303\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.190\nIf you have your backup drive set,\n\n304\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.040\nand it's not connected,\nthis menu won't open up.\n\n305\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.880\nIf it isn't set, this will open up, and\n\n306\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.250\nthis is where it'll give you\nthe ability to select the disk.\n\n307\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.340\nNow, notice something, that it's\nbacking up data already, all right?\n\n308\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:37.120\nSo that's one of the things that you can\ndo if you say, Back Up Automatically.\n\n309\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.960\nThat's how you can schedule a back up\ninside of your Mac operating system.\n\n310\n00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.632\nI gotta be careful,\ncuz I've been saying Windows so\n\n311\n00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:43.300\nmuch-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.430\n&gt;&gt; I know I'm going to mess up and\n\n313\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.000\nsit here and say Windows.\n\n314\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.980\nSo you can, and you can see that it\ndoes different types of backups, right?\n\n315\n00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.270\nNotice that it says Time Machine\nkeeps backups hourly for\n\n316\n00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:58.010\nthe past 24 hours, daily for\nthe past month, weekly.\n\n317\n00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.320\nAnd you guys can read this out there,\nguys and gals out there, all right?\n\n318\n00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.579\nFor all previous months.\n\n319\n00:16:02.579 --> 00:16:07.568\nNow notice, it also lets you know that the\noldest backups are deleted when your disk\n\n320\n00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.150\nbecomes full.\n\n321\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.213\nBe careful with this, right?\n\n322\n00:16:10.213 --> 00:16:13.745\nI've actually had this problem\nwhere I didn't realize,\n\n323\n00:16:13.745 --> 00:16:15.480\nbecause I sudden forget it.\n\n324\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.282\nIt's nice to have on schedule,\nit's not a bad thing.\n\n325\n00:16:18.282 --> 00:16:20.760\nHave 1 terabyte drive right now,\nthat it's connected to.\n\n326\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.000\nAnd I didn't realize it Dan, a couple\nof weeks back, I plugged my drive in.\n\n327\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.320\nAnd time machine started giving me\na warning, said I've got 50 gigs left.\n\n328\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.690\nThat's out of a 1 terabyte drive, because\nI didn't pay attention to the fact that\n\n329\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.810\nthe moment I plug it in,\nit's scheduled to run it's back ups.\n\n330\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.040\nAnd it essentially just\nfilled up the entire drive so\n\n331\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.890\nI didn't have any space left.\n\n332\n00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.190\n&gt;&gt; So you were plugging in,\nplugging out, plugging in, plugging out.\n\n333\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.830\nAnd it was taking a back up every\ntime you've reconnected that sucker.\n\n334\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.820\nAnd it'll go, hey, I got the space.\n\n335\n00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.060\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and it did, and\nthen at a certain point it stopped.\n\n336\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.690\nAnd it said well,\nnow what do you wanna do?\n\n337\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.860\nAnd you gotta be careful because,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n338\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.610\nshow you here on this drive here.\n\n339\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.660\nThere's your backup file, or\nyour backup folder, if you will.\n\n340\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:10.470\nYou can see Backups.backupdb, and\nagain that's short for database.\n\n341\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.040\nIt doesn't like you to delete this file,\nright?\n\n342\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.180\nSo if I go in and I have other files-\n&gt;&gt; You don't like it to delete that file.\n\n343\n00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you dont want it to\n\n344\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.120\ndelete that file at all.\n\n345\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.210\nBut I will tell you, when it decided that\nit wasn't gonna backup anything else,\n\n346\n00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.180\nI tried to delete some old\nbackups that it had in there.\n\n347\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.980\nAnd it doesn't like that at all,\nso just pay attention.\n\n348\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.700\nIf you're gonna schedule your backups,\n\n349\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.270\nyou wanna make sure that you\nhave plenty of drive space.\n\n350\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.830\nSo just pay attention to these, and\n\n351\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.080\nif you start getting to where\nmaybe the backups are full.\n\n352\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.740\nJust pay attention to your\ntime machine preferences.\n\n353\n00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.190\nSo that's a great thing to have,\n\n354\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.280\nit's good to have this here,\nmake sure that you use it.\n\n355\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.470\nJust like in any other operating system,\n\n356\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:58.710\nwe keep backups as part of best practices\nand normal system maintenance right?\n\n357\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.240\nNow speaking of maintenance,\n\n358\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.992\nthe other thing that they\ncall out is disc maintenance.\n\n359\n00:18:02.992 --> 00:18:05.480\nThere are a couple of different utilities,\n\n360\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.970\nwe'll talk about the Ubuntu one,\nor in Linux.\n\n361\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.300\nBecause there are different utilities\ndepending on whether you have a graphical\n\n362\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.930\nuser interface, whether you're gonna be\nusing something like the terminal here.\n\n363\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.890\nBut for the most part, what they're\ngonna call out, more so than anything,\n\n364\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.770\njust because of the commonality of Ubuntu,\nis probably the graphical user interface.\n\n365\n00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.710\nWe'll talk about some of the command line\ninterfaces, or terminal, if you will.\n\n366\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:32.440\nCommand prompt, it's not command prompt,\nbut command line terminal here coming up.\n\n367\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.300\nAgain, in the Ubuntu operating system.\n\n368\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.290\nLet me go ahead and get logged in here,\nI'll show you guys the desktop here.\n\n369\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.088\nAgain, you do have the ability\nthat you can go to, and\n\n370\n00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:46.660\nlet me close out of this here.\n\n371\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.690\nThis is the Unity interface that\nDan was mentioning earlier.\n\n372\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.452\nIt's got a lot of cool features and\nfunctionality.\n\n373\n00:18:53.452 --> 00:18:56.330\nIt's got kind of like Mac\ndoes with Spotlight search.\n\n374\n00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.230\nIf I'm in Mac,\nI can do a Spotlight search and\n\n375\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.200\nsearch for anything within the computer,\napplications as well.\n\n376\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.430\nWell, the Unity desktop also has that too,\nwhich is kinda cool right there.\n\n377\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.100\nBasically, you just click the little\nUbuntu icon, and if you type the word\n\n378\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.320\ndisks, you will see that you do have\nthis utility here called Disks, right?\n\n379\n00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.910\nAnd that allows you to do some\ngeneral disk maintenance, right?\n\n380\n00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.420\nWe can do partitioning,\nwe can set up repair drives if you will.\n\n381\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.940\nNow, keep in mind,\n\n382\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.500\ntoo, that it depends on how you\nhave your file systems implemented.\n\n383\n00:19:27.885 --> 00:19:30.815\nWhether you can do things\nlike shrinking partitions,\n\n384\n00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:33.765\ndividing partitions like\nwe talked about in Windows.\n\n385\n00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:39.775\nI believe you have to set up your disk\nwith an LVM, a logical volume manager,\n\n386\n00:19:39.775 --> 00:19:42.835\nto be able to manipulate these and\nresize these partitions.\n\n387\n00:19:42.835 --> 00:19:45.258\nBut we're not worried about that too much.\n\n388\n00:19:45.258 --> 00:19:48.427\nBut I do want you to pay attention,\nup here, this little,\n\n389\n00:19:48.427 --> 00:19:50.773\nkind of ellipse button or three bars here.\n\n390\n00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:53.766\nThat's your settings and\nthat allows you to do many really,\n\n391\n00:19:53.766 --> 00:19:55.240\nreally cool things, right?\n\n392\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.420\nSo, for instance, you can format a disk,\n\n393\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.330\nif you will,\nkinda like we've mentioned here.\n\n394\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.980\nYou can also do it through\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n395\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.100\nYou can do benchmarking,\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n396\n00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.320\nYou can benchmark the drive,\n\n397\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.490\nyou want to see what the performance level\nof the drive is, which is kinda cool here.\n\n398\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.740\nBut other things that you can do too,\nis if the drive supports\n\n399\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:17.520\nthe self monitoring analysis and\nreport technology, the SMART technology.\n\n400\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.790\nIt'll allow you to do again,\n\n401\n00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.950\nprovided that it supports it,\nyou can see this drive doesn't have it.\n\n402\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.520\nAnd you can do basically\ndiagnostics to your drive too,\n\n403\n00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.150\nso nice little utility to have.\n\n404\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.530\nKeep in mind that I'm not sure if\nthey're really gonna go into depth.\n\n405\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.550\nBut just know that in the Ubuntu\noperating systems, you do have disks,\n\n406\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.910\nas well as some other utilities,\ntoo, right?\n\n407\n00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.670\nThat's one of the ones that,\nwhen it comes to disk maintenance,\n\n408\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.820\nthat we need to kinda be aware of.\n\n409\n00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.580\nIf we drop back down to\nour Mac operating system.\n\n410\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.000\nWe have one that's,\nI've found a couple of different ways.\n\n411\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.720\nIf I use the Spotlight search,\napparently it pulls up time machine,\n\n412\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.970\nwe can use the disk utility,\nit makes it kinda easy to find anything.\n\n413\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.682\n&gt;&gt; Wes, what's that hotkey you're using\nto get a Spotlight search to show up?\n\n414\n00:21:07.682 --> 00:21:08.810\n&gt;&gt; Great, great question there.\n\n415\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.790\nThat right there is your command,\nright, with the little,\n\n416\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.900\nI don't know what you'd call\nthe little icon on the command.\n\n417\n00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.490\n&gt;&gt; To me it looks like,\nalmost like a clover leaf.\n\n418\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.960\n&gt;&gt; The clover leaf thank you,\nwith the spacebar, right?\n\n419\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.070\nAnd that's a little keyboard shortcut,\nright?\n\n420\n00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.640\nJust like if you were gonna bring up the\ntraditional run line inside of Windows,\n\n421\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.170\nyou do a Windows key R.\n\n422\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.140\nThink of command as kind of akin to\nwhat a Windows key is on a Windows\n\n423\n00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.430\nkeyboard, right?\n\n424\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.360\nAnd that's all I'm doing is, now I say the\nWindows key, I knew it was gonna happen.\n\n425\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.750\nIt's the command key with the spacebar.\n\n426\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.860\nNow, there's another way that you\ncan get to the Spotlight search.\n\n427\n00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.800\nAnd you can kind of manipulate\n\n428\n00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.690\nthe way Spotlight search works Let me\ngo ahead and show you that here too.\n\n429\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.530\nSo if I go up to the Help\nmenu bar here and\n\n430\n00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.330\nI click on the little apple,\nI can go to System Preferences.\n\n431\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.470\nAnd up at the top row here,\nyou'll see Spotlight.\n\n432\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.140\nSo I do have the option that\nI could change, right, where,\n\n433\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.560\njust basically manipulating the Spotlight\nsearch if I want to, right?\n\n434\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.040\nOnly selected categories will appear\nin the Spotlight search results, right?\n\n435\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.590\nSo little bit just about the spotlight\nthat there, because they do mention that\n\n436\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.680\nin the objectives, and\nthey kinda want you to know about it.\n\n437\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.640\nSo, back to the disk utility,\nlet's show you how you can get there.\n\n438\n00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.910\nAnd again you can use the Spotlight\nsearch if you want to.\n\n439\n00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:35.020\nBut you can also go to, again the help\nmenu up here at the top, the menu bar.\n\n440\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.050\nYou can choose Go, and\nthen you can scroll down to Utilities.\n\n441\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.870\nWhen you go to Utilities in the upper,\n\n442\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.280\nwell I guess it depends on\nhow Finder is arranged.\n\n443\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.790\nFinder can be arranged in a couple ways.\n\n444\n00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.780\nAnd we'll talk about Finder coming up.\n\n445\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.270\nIf you're in the defaults, you can see\nhere, for me it's up in the upper left, or\n\n446\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.990\nright hand corner.\n\n447\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.225\nI swear I know my right from my left.\n\n448\n00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:56.870\n[LAUGH] And we choose that, all right now,\nthis gives me the ability that\n\n449\n00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.405\nif I want to I can run,\nagain do more partitioning right?.\n\n450\n00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:02.955\nWe can divide up a drive if you will.\n\n451\n00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:05.385\nWe can apply a file system to it.\n\n452\n00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:11.085\nBut more importantly, for disk maintenance\nwe could run the first-aid on this.\n\n453\n00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:16.775\nSo if you do suspect that you have\na drive that you wanna run first-aid on,\n\n454\n00:23:16.775 --> 00:23:18.230\nyou can run it.\n\n455\n00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.910\nAll right, and it will let you know that\nit's gonna kinda keep your boot drive\n\n456\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.270\nin a special, I mean,\nlike a locked mode, if you will.\n\n457\n00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.550\nSo, basically, just be careful, right?\n\n458\n00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.630\nAnd this shouldn't really\ntake too long here.\n\n459\n00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.940\nBut you can kinda see, yeah,\nit's kinda locked up there.\n\n460\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.570\nThere you go,\nyou can kinda see what it's doing here.\n\n461\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.020\nIt's going through and\nit's checking everything.\n\n462\n00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.540\nSo, it's good to use this if you feel\nlike maybe that you have a problem.\n\n463\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.120\nThe other time that I've actually\nused this, too, is Mac is really,\n\n464\n00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.090\nreally particular on making sure\nthat you safely eject drives.\n\n465\n00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:56.190\nSo much so, that sometimes if\nyou don't safely eject a drive,\n\n466\n00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.790\nwhen you go to plug it back in,\nyou have problems right?\n\n467\n00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.130\nIn fact sometimes it won't even see it.\n\n468\n00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.461\nAnd I've actually got to where,\nhey, it did see it.\n\n469\n00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:07.080\nBecause, for whatever reason,\nI plugged it in, and it seen it again.\n\n470\n00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.140\nAnd I ran first aid on it\nright away just to make sure.\n\n471\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.790\nThat I didn't have a problem.\n\n472\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.727\nSo, let me go ahead just real quick as\npart of just, I know it's not really\n\n473\n00:24:13.727 --> 00:24:17.297\nscheduled disk maintenance but\nit is part of best practices here.\n\n474\n00:24:17.297 --> 00:24:21.536\nIf you haven't seen this, one of\nthe things that you're gonna wanna know is\n\n475\n00:24:21.536 --> 00:24:23.798\nright click on a drive and choose Eject.\n\n476\n00:24:23.798 --> 00:24:25.480\nNow, this is actually a partition drive.\n\n477\n00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.009\nSo it looks like two disks here,\nit's actually only one disk.\n\n478\n00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:33.060\nI didn't make that mistake of letting\nTimeMachine take up a whole terabyte.\n\n479\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I went ahead and\n\n480\n00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.238\npartitioned it with\nthe Disk Utility there.\n\n481\n00:24:36.238 --> 00:24:39.761\nSo, you'll see that it's gonna, it should\ngive me a little warning that says right,\n\n482\n00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:42.726\nwait a second here, this is a partition\non a disk that has 2 partitions.\n\n483\n00:24:42.726 --> 00:24:43.990\nDo you want to eject them all?\n\n484\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.763\nAnd I'll just go ahead, say Eject All.\n\n485\n00:24:45.763 --> 00:24:50.604\n&gt;&gt; Wes, this little factoid about the Mac\noperating system is actually the lynch pin\n\n486\n00:24:50.604 --> 00:24:54.886\nfor me to push away from Mac hardware\noperating systems specifically and\n\n487\n00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:58.000\ninto I'm gonna get a System76 for\nmy next laptop.\n\n488\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.725\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, yeah.\n\n489\n00:24:58.725 --> 00:25:02.147\nNow, System76,\nthat is where you can run like a Ubuntu?\n\n490\n00:25:02.147 --> 00:25:03.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it comes with a Ubuntu.\n\n491\n00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.011\n&gt;&gt; It comes with a Ubuntu.\n\n492\n00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:06.523\nSo, that's one of the great\nthings you say and\n\n493\n00:25:06.523 --> 00:25:10.776\nthat's why I'm glad to see this in the A+\nlevel because of the fact that we talk\n\n494\n00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:14.319\nabout the more prevalent operating\nsystems like Mac and Linux and\n\n495\n00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:18.653\nnow we've got a hardware that they say,\nhey, we're just gonna ship it to you.\n\n496\n00:25:18.653 --> 00:25:22.544\nAnd it's gonna have Windows and it's gonna\nhave Ubuntu on it that we've seen some too\n\n497\n00:25:22.544 --> 00:25:24.723\nthat just have Ubuntu on\nthem out there as well.\n\n498\n00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:29.178\nWe've even seen tablets today that could\ndo fast boots between different operating\n\n499\n00:25:29.178 --> 00:25:29.749\nsystems.\n\n500\n00:25:29.749 --> 00:25:31.975\nI think there was kind of\na licensing violation.\n\n501\n00:25:31.975 --> 00:25:33.779\nI think they stopped that for\nwhatever reason.\n\n502\n00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:34.324\nBut, again,\n\n503\n00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:37.517\nyou can start to see where five years ago\nwe wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\n504\n00:25:37.517 --> 00:25:38.447\n&gt;&gt; Never would at all.\n\n505\n00:25:38.447 --> 00:25:39.981\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n506\n00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:43.923\nAll right, that is a little bit\nabout your disk management.\n\n507\n00:25:43.923 --> 00:25:47.096\nI know we're running up on a little\nbit short on time on this one.\n\n508\n00:25:47.096 --> 00:25:51.155\nSo, one of the last things I wanna just\nkind of briefly go over is they mentioned\n\n509\n00:25:51.155 --> 00:25:54.108\nsystem updates and\nwhen they talk about system updates,\n\n510\n00:25:54.108 --> 00:25:55.975\nthey also talk about the App Store.\n\n511\n00:25:55.975 --> 00:25:58.562\nAll right, well, that's all part\nof patch management, right?\n\n512\n00:25:58.562 --> 00:26:02.850\nAnd just like any operating system\nyou've gotta perform some level of patch\n\n513\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:03.657\nmanagement.\n\n514\n00:26:03.657 --> 00:26:07.669\nNow, if you're in an enterprising,\na corporate environment typically\n\n515\n00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:12.199\nwhat you're gonna be doing and Dan, you've\ntalked about this in other episodes,\n\n516\n00:26:12.199 --> 00:26:16.793\nis you might be submitting a ticket, some\nkind of patch management that says, hey,\n\n517\n00:26:16.793 --> 00:26:18.826\nwe need this new update, all right?\n\n518\n00:26:18.826 --> 00:26:19.953\nWell, you need the update?\n\n519\n00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:21.643\nOkay.\nHave you tested it on the machines?\n\n520\n00:26:21.643 --> 00:26:22.449\nIs it stable?\n\n521\n00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:24.638\nHas it broken our line\nof business software?\n\n522\n00:26:24.638 --> 00:26:27.928\nIs our line of business software\nthat we just paid $75,000 for\n\n523\n00:26:27.928 --> 00:26:30.206\ncontinue to work after\nyou applied the update?\n\n524\n00:26:30.206 --> 00:26:33.535\nSo it's not as simple as just clickety,\nclickety, clickety and your done.\n\n525\n00:26:33.535 --> 00:26:36.511\nNow, in your home environment that\nmight be exactly what you do, right?\n\n526\n00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:40.881\nSo, keep in mind that patch management\nit's a systematic approach to applying\n\n527\n00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:45.253\nsystem updates, firmware, and DriveWare\nupdates to your systems to maintain\n\n528\n00:26:45.253 --> 00:26:47.879\nstability and\nminimize the downtime, right?\n\n529\n00:26:47.879 --> 00:26:51.028\nAnd I know that you've seen this\nbefore in your line of business too.\n\n530\n00:26:51.028 --> 00:26:55.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do enough of this stuff,\nyou're gonna see good plans go wrong,\n\n531\n00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.406\nright?\n\n532\n00:26:56.406 --> 00:26:59.478\nAnd obviously, patching and\nupdating your systems is a good thing and\n\n533\n00:26:59.478 --> 00:27:00.833\nit increases functionality,\n\n534\n00:27:00.833 --> 00:27:04.756\nit closes security vulnerabilities, those\ntypes of things, those are things we want.\n\n535\n00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:05.863\nIt's good, right?\n\n536\n00:27:05.863 --> 00:27:09.022\nBut every now and then it just\ndoesn't go the way we had hoped and\n\n537\n00:27:09.022 --> 00:27:10.960\nit can damage the system.\n\n538\n00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.187\nDamage other software.\n\n539\n00:27:12.187 --> 00:27:15.627\nJust, I mean, cause general\ndisarray inside of your systems.\n\n540\n00:27:15.627 --> 00:27:17.172\nYou have to roll back from that.\n\n541\n00:27:17.172 --> 00:27:19.920\nAnd that's where our backups\ncome in very much handy, right?\n\n542\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.924\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to a previous state.\n\n543\n00:27:21.924 --> 00:27:25.334\nTime machine's fantastic for that,\ndoing any of the backup stuff that we have\n\n544\n00:27:25.334 --> 00:27:27.411\ninside of our Linux utilities,\nalso the same.\n\n545\n00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:30.670\nAnd Windows is no exception either.\n\n546\n00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.662\nYou have to do it for\nall three of these types of systems.\n\n547\n00:27:32.662 --> 00:27:33.639\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n548\n00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:35.402\nIt's interesting that\nwe put backups first.\n\n549\n00:27:35.402 --> 00:27:37.217\nIt's almost like we planned it that way,\nthat's right.\n\n550\n00:27:37.217 --> 00:27:37.954\n&gt;&gt; It's weird.\n\n551\n00:27:37.954 --> 00:27:40.030\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\nlet's just take the last few minutes.\n\n552\n00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.714\nWe're gonna definitely have to go into\npart two cuz we've got a lot of other\n\n553\n00:27:42.714 --> 00:27:43.705\ngreat stuff to talk about.\n\n554\n00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:46.068\nBut let's go ahead and\njust show you where you would do updates.\n\n555\n00:27:46.068 --> 00:27:49.952\nNow, I did call out drivers and\nthey also call out firmware.\n\n556\n00:27:49.952 --> 00:27:52.826\nUnderstand in the Mac world,\nit's gonna be all in one, right?\n\n557\n00:27:52.826 --> 00:27:57.768\nJust understand that when Apple releases\nan update, they control all the updates.\n\n558\n00:27:57.768 --> 00:27:58.512\nWhy?\n\n559\n00:27:58.512 --> 00:28:00.509\nBecause they control all the hardware,\ntoo, right?\n\n560\n00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:03.513\nAnd when I say proprietary,\nwe're talking Uber proprietaries.\n\n561\n00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:07.564\nNot like PC where there's a lot of\ndifferent PC manufacturers that go to\n\n562\n00:28:07.564 --> 00:28:11.480\nMicrosoft and they license Windows\nto be put on operating systems and\n\n563\n00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.602\nyou have a whole bunch of\npotential hardware, right?\n\n564\n00:28:14.602 --> 00:28:17.987\nIt's really locked down\nto just Apple doing this.\n\n565\n00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:20.643\nSo, you're gonna see it\nin the same location.\n\n566\n00:28:20.643 --> 00:28:22.419\nA couple different ways you can get to it.\n\n567\n00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:24.387\nThe end point is still the same.\n\n568\n00:28:24.387 --> 00:28:27.446\nIf you want you can always\ngo to the App Store, right?\n\n569\n00:28:27.446 --> 00:28:30.207\nAnd if we go to the App Store\nyou can use your launcher here.\n\n570\n00:28:30.207 --> 00:28:31.530\nI believe App Store is in the launcher.\n\n571\n00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.718\n&gt;&gt; It's usually is.\n\n572\n00:28:32.718 --> 00:28:34.847\nIt's hiding in there somewhere.\n\n573\n00:28:34.847 --> 00:28:35.975\n&gt;&gt; It is hiding in there.\n\n574\n00:28:35.975 --> 00:28:37.854\nAnd I say the launcher and\nit's not in there.\n\n575\n00:28:37.854 --> 00:28:42.710\nLet's go another way, and we can go to\nthe help menu taskbar here or menu bar,\n\n576\n00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.552\nif you will.\n\n577\n00:28:43.552 --> 00:28:45.630\nAnd then we can go to Applications.\n\n578\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:51.645\nAnd when we go to Applications the App\nStore should be right there, there we go.\n\n579\n00:28:51.645 --> 00:28:55.582\nAnd the other thing, too, is a default\ninstall it's in the doc as well.\n\n580\n00:28:55.582 --> 00:28:56.976\nWe'll talk a little bit\nmore about the doc here.\n\n581\n00:28:56.976 --> 00:29:01.025\nI've got mine kind of manipulated for\nwhat we do here at ITProTV.\n\n582\n00:29:01.025 --> 00:29:02.097\nAnd I can launch this.\n\n583\n00:29:02.097 --> 00:29:03.972\nAnd again guys, we're not getting paid for\n\n584\n00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:07.375\nany of the commercials that you might see\nhere, so I do apologize ahead of time.\n\n585\n00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:09.445\nMaybe some of you developers\nout there are like, wow,\n\n586\n00:29:09.445 --> 00:29:11.432\nwe really need to get our\napp there on the front page.\n\n587\n00:29:11.432 --> 00:29:12.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n588\n00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.482\nBut if you notice here,\nyou have the update option.\n\n589\n00:29:15.482 --> 00:29:19.580\nIf I can zoom in here and\nget the help bar out of the way there.\n\n590\n00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.534\nWe do have the option here.\n\n591\n00:29:20.534 --> 00:29:23.522\nAnd now, this update,\nit updates everything.\n\n592\n00:29:23.522 --> 00:29:25.446\nAnd you can see that\nthere are some updates,\n\n593\n00:29:25.446 --> 00:29:27.786\napparently I have done some\nupdates here in the past.\n\n594\n00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:29.722\nAnd notice its applications as well.\n\n595\n00:29:29.722 --> 00:29:35.522\nAnd that's why I said it's all bundled\ntogether inside of your operating system.\n\n596\n00:29:35.522 --> 00:29:40.078\nNow, so that's where you're gonna go to\nupdate pretty much your Mac operating\n\n597\n00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:40.626\nsystem.\n\n598\n00:29:40.626 --> 00:29:47.623\nNow, if you're in Ubuntu there's a couple\nof different ways that you can do this.\n\n599\n00:29:47.623 --> 00:29:51.263\nLet me go and switch back over to\nmy Ubuntu operating system and\n\n600\n00:29:51.263 --> 00:29:55.533\nclose down disks and apparently I have\nlogged out, so time down a grade,\n\n601\n00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:57.992\nwrite security, security, security.\n\n602\n00:29:57.992 --> 00:30:03.242\nGo ahead and close down the disks\nutility and what you have here over\n\n603\n00:30:03.242 --> 00:30:08.236\non your unity bar here on the left\nhand side is Ubuntu Software.\n\n604\n00:30:08.236 --> 00:30:10.532\nAnd when you click Ubuntu Software,\nI want you to notice them.\n\n605\n00:30:10.532 --> 00:30:16.066\nNow, I went ahead, Dan and I didn't do\nany updates on this for a reason, right?\n\n606\n00:30:16.066 --> 00:30:20.206\nPast just getting the VMware tools\ninstalled because I want you guys to\n\n607\n00:30:20.206 --> 00:30:24.848\nsee that when I click updates, notice\nthat we've got a whole bunch of things.\n\n608\n00:30:24.848 --> 00:30:27.211\nWe've got applications, right?\n\n609\n00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:31.968\nWe've got software and updates but I also\nwant you to notice if I look at the top,\n\n610\n00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:36.310\nnotice that it includes performance and\nthat means OS Updates, right?\n\n611\n00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:40.683\nSo, we have it includes performance,\nstability, security and improvement.\n\n612\n00:30:40.683 --> 00:30:45.227\nNow, I think down, I'll go ahead and\nmention one more thing\n\n613\n00:30:45.227 --> 00:30:50.306\nbecause the other way that you can\nupdate things like an installer or\n\n614\n00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:53.888\ninstall updates is through apt-get, right?\n\n615\n00:30:53.888 --> 00:30:56.480\nSo, and they do kind of mention apt-get.\n\n616\n00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.349\n&gt;&gt; You just say apt-get.\n\n617\n00:30:58.349 --> 00:30:59.066\n&gt;&gt; I'll get it right eventually.\n\n618\n00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:00.642\nApt-get, yeah, thanks man,\nI appreciate it.\n\n619\n00:31:00.642 --> 00:31:02.399\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n620\n00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:05.586\nthat's why you have to have a Linux\nguy here with you on this show.\n\n621\n00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:08.446\nAgain, I could go to\nthe terminal if I wanted to, and\n\n622\n00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:10.662\nlet me go ahead and just type in T-E-R.\n\n623\n00:31:10.662 --> 00:31:12.928\n&gt;&gt; That would be the best way to\ntype in apt-get is the terminal.\n\n624\n00:31:12.928 --> 00:31:14.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit is through the terminal, right?\n\n625\n00:31:14.712 --> 00:31:18.578\n[LAUGH] This is your command.\n\n626\n00:31:18.578 --> 00:31:19.596\nAnd what do they call it?\n\n627\n00:31:19.596 --> 00:31:21.147\nI always call it terminal,\nbut they call it something.\n\n628\n00:31:21.147 --> 00:31:22.207\n&gt;&gt; They're terminal.\n\n629\n00:31:22.207 --> 00:31:23.071\nYeah, I always call it terminal.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n630\n00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:23.632\n&gt;&gt; Console.\n\n631\n00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:27.234\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, they call it shell,\nand again, that's why I was looking for\n\n632\n00:31:27.234 --> 00:31:28.774\nthe shell environment, right?\n\n633\n00:31:28.774 --> 00:31:29.669\nBut let me go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n634\n00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:33.032\ntechnically the unity environment is also\na shell, it's just a graphical shell.\n\n635\n00:31:33.032 --> 00:31:33.752\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n636\n00:31:33.752 --> 00:31:37.516\nSo, exam objectives,\nmake sure you understand that, right?\n\n637\n00:31:37.516 --> 00:31:40.511\nWe always call it terminal and\nbecause I'm usually in Windows,\n\n638\n00:31:40.511 --> 00:31:43.624\nI'm always saying Command Prompt\neven if it is just the terminal.\n\n639\n00:31:43.624 --> 00:31:47.088\nBut again, you can do apt-get.\n\n640\n00:31:47.088 --> 00:31:52.382\n&gt;&gt; Here now, I will tell you,\nif I try do like an apt-get install and\n\n641\n00:31:52.382 --> 00:31:59.145\nopenvpn, you might see that I get an error\nand I believe this will throw me an error.\n\n642\n00:31:59.145 --> 00:32:03.086\nAnd one of the reasons I believe\nis permission denied, all right.\n\n643\n00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:06.761\nAnd that's because just like in the\nWindows environment we talk about having\n\n644\n00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:08.070\na Windows administrator.\n\n645\n00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.555\nWell, where do you think\nWindows got it from, right?\n\n646\n00:32:09.555 --> 00:32:12.650\nThey got it from the Unix,\nbasically the Unix root user and\n\n647\n00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.261\nLinux is that derivative still\nfollowing that same architecture.\n\n648\n00:32:16.261 --> 00:32:22.787\nSo, what you have to do as\na superuser do or sudo if you will.\n\n649\n00:32:22.787 --> 00:32:25.044\nYou do have to be the administrator or\nyou have to be root.\n\n650\n00:32:25.044 --> 00:32:28.273\nWe typically don't run in root and\nI learned this from Dan,\n\n651\n00:32:28.273 --> 00:32:29.961\nyou never run in root, right?\n\n652\n00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:31.130\nBecause of the-\n&gt;&gt; Never, never.\n\n653\n00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.401\n&gt;&gt; They will never run in root.\n\n654\n00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:34.599\nYou never run as the root,\nyou never login as root,\n\n655\n00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:36.863\nI guess is probably the better\nway to say it, right?\n\n656\n00:32:36.863 --> 00:32:37.806\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't login as root.\n\n657\n00:32:37.806 --> 00:32:41.782\nYou can change into the root user\nfirst if you're gonna do a bunch of\n\n658\n00:32:41.782 --> 00:32:46.611\nadministrative tasks, it can save you\na lot of time and headache typing sudo, or\n\n659\n00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:49.257\nforgetting to type sudo\nin a bunch of times.\n\n660\n00:32:49.257 --> 00:32:51.025\n&gt;&gt; Do your administrative tasks and\nlog back down.\n\n661\n00:32:51.025 --> 00:32:53.818\nOther than that, you're gonna run some\none-offs, you're gonna use the sudo,\n\n662\n00:32:53.818 --> 00:32:54.475\nit's very handy.\n\n663\n00:32:54.475 --> 00:32:55.243\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n664\n00:32:55.243 --> 00:32:59.363\nSo you could run something like sudo and\nwhat is it?\n\n665\n00:32:59.363 --> 00:33:03.730\nApt-get, excuse me there,\nI'll get that right eventually, and\n\n666\n00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.040\nI could do something like updates.\n\n667\n00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:13.230\nAnd let's see if I login, and then we're\ndoing updates as well there too as well.\n\n668\n00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.919\nAnd kudos out there to the chat room,\nMr. Andrew.\n\n669\n00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:18.095\nAs always,\nwe love having our viewers out there.\n\n670\n00:33:18.095 --> 00:33:22.037\nAlso let you know that if you wanna\ndo your updates and upgrades as well,\n\n671\n00:33:22.037 --> 00:33:24.151\nlet me go ahead and clear this screen.\n\n672\n00:33:24.151 --> 00:33:29.169\n&gt;&gt; Well, no update has occurred\nrunning just the update command.\n\n673\n00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:29.706\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n674\n00:33:29.706 --> 00:33:31.939\n&gt;&gt; It just finds the packages\nthat are available for updates.\n\n675\n00:33:31.939 --> 00:33:32.946\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\nI got you, Dan.\n\n676\n00:33:32.946 --> 00:33:33.460\nGood.\n\n677\n00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.244\n&gt;&gt; Then if you want to install those\nupdates you have to run the upgrade\n\n678\n00:33:37.244 --> 00:33:38.072\ncommand.\n\n679\n00:33:38.072 --> 00:33:39.877\nOkay, very good, and thank you again.\n\n680\n00:33:39.877 --> 00:33:43.025\nSo great to have the Linux user here,\nthat's right.\n\n681\n00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:44.475\nSo, do keep that in mind, and\n\n682\n00:33:44.475 --> 00:33:48.420\nDan, I know we've probably blown this one\nout of the water when it comes on time,\n\n683\n00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.400\nbut we did wanna just kinda throw\nthat in there before we end.\n\n684\n00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.639\nAnd again, remember, driver and\nfirmware updates all in one for Mac.\n\n685\n00:33:55.639 --> 00:33:58.813\nKeep in mind that you have\nthe software updater as well.\n\n686\n00:33:58.813 --> 00:34:03.684\nYour Ubuntu software, you've got\napt-get inside of Ubuntu as well.\n\n687\n00:34:03.684 --> 00:34:07.534\nIf you're in other flavors of\nLinux it might be the YUM command.\n\n688\n00:34:07.534 --> 00:34:11.241\nAgain, so it really just depends on\nwhat Linux distro you are gonna be in.\n\n689\n00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:13.923\nBut it does look like we're gonna\nhave to go into a part two.\n\n690\n00:34:13.923 --> 00:34:15.131\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell, it's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n691\n00:34:15.131 --> 00:34:18.564\nI know I've had a lot of fun so\nfar and hopefully you have as well and\n\n692\n00:34:18.564 --> 00:34:22.140\njust continue on with us down this\nrole of Mac and Linux fun, right?\n\n693\n00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.541\nSo, join us for part two.\n\n694\n00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:25.727\nAs for this one we're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day.\n\n695\n00:34:25.727 --> 00:34:28.313\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n696\n00:34:28.313 --> 00:34:28.961\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n697\n00:34:28.961 --> 00:34:31.450\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n698\n00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:37.391\n[MUSIC]\n\n699\n00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:40.647\nThank you for watching

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:13.935\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.890\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.779\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode it's more NRA+ series,\n\n6\n00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.620\ntrying to round that out for you guys.\n\n7\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.235\nAnd speaking of rounding out,\nwe're actually moving into part two on Mac\n\n8\n00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.050\noperating system and Linux features\nthat you might find inside of that exam.\n\n9\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.843\nJoining us back in the studio again\nto continue that conversation,\n\n10\n00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:34.170\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.630\nWes, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.540\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.190\nWhen you said round it out I'm glad\nyou weren't talking about my figure.\n\n14\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.875\nI thought that's where you were going for\nsure.\n\n15\n00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're gonna eat\na bunch of potato chips.\n\n16\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.028\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right, bring on the bread.\n\n17\n00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:47.860\nThat's right, we're coming back in a part\ntwo like Dan said, on our Mac OS and\n\n18\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.920\nour Linux features.\n\n19\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.840\nAnd we're just basically working\nthrough our list of objectives.\n\n20\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.311\nIf you weren't with us in the first part,\nremember we talked about some basics,\n\n21\n00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:56.920\nbackups.\n\n22\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.980\nTalked about some of the disk\nmaintenance utilities that you have and\n\n23\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.460\nsome of the things that you could do for\nscheduling your back ups if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.141\nSystem updates we mentioned as well,\nthings like patch management, driver and\n\n25\n00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:10.070\nfirmware updates.\n\n26\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.804\nAnd basically,\n\n27\n00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:14.270\nwhat we're gonna do is we're just gonna\nkinda pick up right where we left off.\n\n28\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.449\nAnd the next subject we have to talk about\nis one that's sometimes you don't really\n\n29\n00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:22.270\nmention too much in these operating\nsystems because, well let's face it,\n\n30\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.680\nWindows they got the big\ntarget on their chest.\n\n31\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.660\nAnd a lot of times people are attacking\nthese Windows based systems.\n\n32\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.390\nAnd what I'm talking about is\nanti-malware or antivirus software.\n\n33\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.260\nNow, when I say that,\ndon't expect that Macs don't get viruses.\n\n34\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.730\nDon't expect that a Linux system\ncan't get a virus, right.\n\n35\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.657\nYou just have to understand that for\nthe most part, these pieces of software,\n\n36\n00:01:45.657 --> 00:01:48.700\nthey're written the DNA\nof a Windows machine.\n\n37\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.940\nA lot of the times,\nthat's what they’re doing.\n\n38\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.440\nThey're writing it in some kind of\nformat that's specific to Windows.\n\n39\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.130\nNow, I will tell you one\nthink that I've heard before.\n\n40\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.093\nAnd again debatable here, I don't\nwanna get into too much of a debate,\n\n41\n00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:04.918\nis that sometimes you can download viruses\nthat don't affect the Mac because they're\n\n42\n00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:08.970\nnot written in the DNA of a Mac\noperating system, they don't affect it.\n\n43\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.310\nBut the moment that you connect that\nMac machine to a Windows environment,\n\n44\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.780\nwell now you might have a problem.\n\n45\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.636\nAgain, whether that's hearsay or\nwhether that's truth or a fact or fiction,\n\n46\n00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:22.060\nI'll leave that to you.\n\n47\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.008\nKeep in mind there is a reason\nyou have a antivirus and\n\n48\n00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.830\nthe anti-malware software out there for\nboth operating systems.\n\n49\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.660\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n50\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.030\nOn our MAC operating system I'm\njust going to go to the App Store.\n\n51\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.136\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, keep in mind,\nwe've got entire series in the library,\n\n52\n00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:41.380\nour course library,\nabout anti-virus software and security.\n\n53\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.944\nAll kinds of different security\nproducts out there, so\n\n54\n00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:46.190\nwe're not really endorsing\none over the other.\n\n55\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.120\n&gt;&gt; Just have one, right?\n\n56\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, that's a great point,\nmake sure you use one.\n\n57\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.950\nSo just go into your app store, if you\nwill, and you can just type in anti-virus.\n\n58\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.451\nYou type in any virus, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:03.010\nyou'll see that sure enough they\ncome up on the list, right.\n\n60\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.606\nThere is a reason why something like\none of the biggest companies out there\n\n61\n00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:10.260\nthat's really finds a lot of these\nviruses out there has like Trend Micro.\n\n62\n00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.604\nThey're out there, so understand that\nwhich one you use is really up to you, but\n\n63\n00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:19.660\nthere are a lot of them out there and\nthere is a reason they're there, right.\n\n64\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.202\nThings like Adware as well too, so\nantivirus, anti-malware software,\n\n65\n00:03:24.202 --> 00:03:27.820\nkeep in mind what you use is up to you,\nthat's your choice.\n\n66\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.070\nBut I can't agree more with Dan, just make\nsure you are gonna use these of some kind.\n\n67\n00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.136\nEspecially if you're bringing these\noperating systems into a Windows\n\n68\n00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.770\nenvironment, really that's just,\n\n69\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.233\na lot of times that's just protecting\nyou in the Windows environments as well.\n\n70\n00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:41.083\nSame thing goes here.\n\n71\n00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:45.053\nIf we just kinda switch right\non over to our Ubuntu and\n\n72\n00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:47.320\nwe go to our Ubuntu software.\n\n73\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.480\nAgain you can also type right in here\nyou can look for software here too.\n\n74\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.885\nAnd if we do an anti-malware\nwell guess what, Or antivirus,\n\n75\n00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:58.790\nthat'd be interesting if\nantivirus doesn't come up.\n\n76\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.330\nLet's see yep, so Clam here.\n\n77\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.890\nYou can see that there's\na graphical front end, right.\n\n78\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.510\nSo, essentially you also have them\ninside of Ubuntu too as well.\n\n79\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.520\nIt's kind of interesting there's\nnot a lot of them it seems like but\n\n80\n00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.199\nthere are some there.\n\n81\n00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.121\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just not in their software store.\n\n82\n00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:13.605\n&gt;&gt; Right but\nthey're not in the software store.\n\n83\n00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:19.720\n&gt;&gt; Sophos runs for Linux, I've installed,\nI love Sophos for Linux, great piece.\n\n84\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.800\nJust gotta go out there and find them.\n\n85\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.070\nSometimes, they're not available in\ntheir little stores that they create.\n\n86\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point.\n\n87\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.530\nAnd again, we're not really\nendorsing any one over the other.\n\n88\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.220\nAgain, just make sure that you have them,\nwhichever one you do go with.\n\n89\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.670\nNow, moving on, there's some other things\nthat we have to talk about as well.\n\n90\n00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.610\nAnd one of those things that really\nhas to do with, well, restoration.\n\n91\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.200\nWe talk about backups, right?\n\n92\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.090\nWell we talked about,\nin the first episode,\n\n93\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.740\nwe talked about Time Machine, right?\n\n94\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.430\nTime Machine is what you're gonna\nuse to back up your software.\n\n95\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.620\nWell, there might be a point in time\nwhere you have to restore from a backup.\n\n96\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.950\nWell, what are you gonna do?\n\n97\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.950\nHow are you going to do\nthat when the time comes?\n\n98\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.910\nSo If I bump back over here to my,\none of these screens here,\n\n99\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.903\nbump back over to our Mac operating\nsystem, notice I have my Time Machine if\n\n100\n00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:13.100\nyou remember I ejected\nit in the first episode.\n\n101\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.820\nWhen I had plugged this back\nin when we're off camera.\n\n102\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.536\nBut what I can do is I can go up to,\n\n103\n00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.970\na couple different ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n104\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.340\nAgain if you go to your menu\nyou can always use your\n\n105\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.040\nlittle command button\ncommand space bar shortcut.\n\n106\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.380\nOr I could go up to the top here,\nyour Help menu bar,\n\n107\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.120\nand then Go and then Applications.\n\n108\n00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.290\nAnd that'll take me, and if I scroll down,\nI'll find Time Machine there.\n\n109\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.130\nNow, because I use Time Machine a lot,\nwe're always tweaking our computers and\n\n110\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.080\ndoing things to them that maybe\nsometimes you shouldn't do.\n\n111\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.271\nSo for me, I don't really want to have\nto search for it, so it's got this nice\n\n112\n00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:57.245\npreference that I'll show you again if you\ndon't remember it from the first episode.\n\n113\n00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:00.779\nBut you can actually put it in your\nHelp bar up here, your menu bar and\n\n114\n00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.770\nyou'll see that it's a little icon.\n\n115\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.618\nNow, remember that one of the things that\nyou can do is you can schedule a back up,\n\n116\n00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:09.430\nthe moment that it's plugged\nin it runs its back up.\n\n117\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.895\nAnd it actually did this when\nI plugged the hard drive\n\n118\n00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:14.800\nback into the USB port here.\n\n119\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.805\nBut you can also Enter Time Machine or you\ncan Enter the Time Machine preferences.\n\n120\n00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:21.510\nLet’s go and\nopen the preferences here real quick.\n\n121\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.563\nI just want to recap, keep in mind that\nyou can put this in the menu bar and\n\n122\n00:06:25.563 --> 00:06:27.330\nthat's where we can see that.\n\n123\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.233\nNow if you are gonna do a restoration,\nif you're going to do a restore or\n\n124\n00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:35.256\nfrom a snapshot then\nwhat you can do here is,\n\n125\n00:06:35.256 --> 00:06:39.700\nyou can use your little icon here and\nyou can enter Time Machine.\n\n126\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.478\nNow when you enter Time Machine,\nyou're gonna see this kinda the 3D\n\n127\n00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:47.730\nscreen here with multiple windows,\nit looks like multiple finder windows.\n\n128\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.694\nBut you'll also see that you\nhave kinda like this slider bar,\n\n129\n00:06:50.694 --> 00:06:52.750\nmy head's kinda covering it up right now.\n\n130\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.930\nOkay just like in Windows they put a lot\nof things in the lower right hand corner.\n\n131\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.310\nWell this also has the lower\nright hand corner likewise.\n\n132\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.500\nBut if I wanted to,\nI could select specific dates and\n\n133\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.080\ntimes that I want to do backups.\n\n134\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.947\nDepending on if it's an hourly backup,\nyou might have multiple backups or\n\n135\n00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:14.720\nsnapshots if you will to do\na restore from in a single day.\n\n136\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.576\nOr you can just choose this up and\ndown arrow, and\n\n137\n00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:20.849\nyou can see I can choose whichever\none it is that I want and\n\n138\n00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:23.720\nthen I could pick this and\nI could do the restore.\n\n139\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.750\nRestore the snapshot here.\n\n140\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.535\nSo that's one of the ways that you can do,\n\n141\n00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:34.342\nwell that's the way you would do it\nhere Mac OS, or Mac operating system.\n\n142\n00:07:34.342 --> 00:07:37.296\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\ncancel out of this,\n\n143\n00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:40.910\nbecause we can also do this inside\nof your Ubuntu environment too.\n\n144\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.774\nNow, remember that to do this in the\nUbuntu environment, let me go ahead and\n\n145\n00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:48.814\nclose our Ubuntu software\napplication down and\n\n146\n00:07:48.814 --> 00:07:51.409\nwe'll go back to our Unity Search here.\n\n147\n00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:55.339\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna type disks and\n\n148\n00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:57.690\nwe're gonna reopen disks here.\n\n149\n00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.740\nNow in the disks part here.\n\n150\n00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.118\nWhat you can do, is you can actually\ngo up to a little settings icon here.\n\n151\n00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.280\nI zoom into that,\nyou can see that a little bit better.\n\n152\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.610\nAnd if, I can create a disk image, right?\n\n153\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.180\nSo I can image the disk.\n\n154\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.360\nAnd that essentially will\ngive me the ability to take\n\n155\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.750\na snapshot of the entire drive, right?\n\n156\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.850\nAnd its current state with\nall the applications and\n\n157\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.130\nall the current configuration settings,\nand then guess what?\n\n158\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.261\nWell, if I need to restore, it's not\nreally too difficult to find, right.\n\n159\n00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:29.954\nThey're making kind of easy to find just\nlike they do here in time machine and\n\n160\n00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:31.080\ninside of your MacOS.\n\n161\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.372\n&gt;&gt; It seems like a smart\nmove on their part.\n\n162\n00:08:32.372 --> 00:08:33.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is, right?\n\n163\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.516\n&gt;&gt; Let's make this process\nas easy as humanly possible.\n\n164\n00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:36.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Most definitely.\n\n165\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.955\n&gt;&gt; She kind host your machine.\n\n166\n00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:38.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:40.217\n&gt;&gt; You're back at it and\nyou don't hate our guts.\n\n168\n00:08:40.217 --> 00:08:41.928\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you work?\n\n169\n00:08:41.928 --> 00:08:42.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.353\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's a good thing,\n\n171\n00:08:44.353 --> 00:08:46.790\nthat's one of the ways you\ncould do it inside of Ubuntu.\n\n172\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.910\nNow there are more technical ways that\nyou can create like bootable disks,\n\n173\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.270\nif you will, and\nthat's through the dd command, I believe.\n\n174\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.680\nThe disk duplicator data duplicator here,\ncreates boot images.\n\n175\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.020\nNow, I did talked to you, one of our\nother host Don Pezet and he's like Dan,\n\n176\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.406\nwho really knows Linux and he said, you\ngot to be careful with that because dd can\n\n177\n00:09:09.406 --> 00:09:14.750\nget very, very finicky with drive\nsizes and drive layout, right?\n\n178\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.970\nSo, it doesn't like to restore\nto different drives and\n\n179\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.650\nstuff like that different drive sizes.\n\n180\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.960\nAnd you also have to make sure\nthat you're not just copying or\n\n181\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.440\nmaking a copy of the partition,\njust the partition.\n\n182\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.780\nYou gotta use, make sure you\nhave the boot partition as well.\n\n183\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.458\nSo, a little bit more complex to it.\n\n184\n00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.568\nBut we do just wanna mention the dd\ncommand there because it is in\n\n185\n00:09:36.568 --> 00:09:37.870\nthe objectives.\n\n186\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.633\nUnderstand that that's the data duplicator\nor disk duplicator, if you will.\n\n187\n00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:42.711\n&gt;&gt; Data destroyer.\n\n188\n00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.214\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Data destroyer.\n\n189\n00:09:44.214 --> 00:09:48.378\n[LAUGH] Dan was mentioning and\nwhat it was originally used for\n\n190\n00:09:48.378 --> 00:09:52.873\nwhich is kind of interesting is it\nwas really used to take data and\n\n191\n00:09:52.873 --> 00:09:57.890\nconvert it to tape format, and\ntake it off a tape format and convert it.\n\n192\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.320\nSo it basically does conversion as well.\n\n193\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.161\nSo, that's a little bit about restoring\nyour snapshots, doing a restore or\n\n194\n00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:08.630\nfrom snapshot,\nagain those are both in there,\n\n195\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.710\nand we'll I just gonna\nmentioned on both here,\n\n196\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.020\nboth on the Ubuntu, Linux side if you\nwill, as well as the Mac operating system.\n\n197\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.620\nAnd that will allow you to do\nimage recovery, like you've seen\n\n198\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.600\nhere inside of the Ubuntu system you\nhave to create the disk image first.\n\n199\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.455\nIt can't restore disk image if\nyou don't have one to begin with.\n\n200\n00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:29.860\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n201\n00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.569\nMoving on here inside our\nobjectives that we have.\n\n202\n00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.180\nSome of the other things\nthat they call out.\n\n203\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.521\nThey call out screen sharing.\n\n204\n00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:46.032\nNow when we look at screen sharing,\nscreen sharing is something\n\n205\n00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:51.553\nthat you can do inside like for\ninstance, inside of your MacOS.\n\n206\n00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:56.395\nAnd it relies on a Wi-Fi\ndirect technology.\n\n207\n00:10:56.395 --> 00:10:59.332\nAnd Wi-Fi direct is\nactually an implementation,\n\n208\n00:10:59.332 --> 00:11:01.805\nit's part of the 802.11 standard.\n\n209\n00:11:01.805 --> 00:11:06.312\nWhat Apple calls theirs is\nwhat's known as Air Display.\n\n210\n00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:11.100\nAnd you can actually see the Air Display\nsettings if we dive in here to our Mac\n\n211\n00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.430\noperating system and we go to System\nPreferences, and then we go to Display.\n\n212\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.138\nYou'll see that I have the ability\nto turn Air Display on or off.\n\n213\n00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.562\nAnd you could see that we've got\na couple here, we've got a Game Room.\n\n214\n00:11:22.562 --> 00:11:25.230\nYou can imagine where the game room is.\n\n215\n00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.760\nBut I don't wanna enter any codes here for\nthe game room.\n\n216\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.260\nBut if I do decide to do that,\nI could basically share the screen of\n\n217\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.170\nmy Mac htere inside of the game room for\nthe Apple TV that we have.\n\n218\n00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.558\nSo understand that you\ncan do screen sharing.\n\n219\n00:11:40.558 --> 00:11:43.744\nNow, following along the same lines too,\n\n220\n00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:49.785\nthat you also have the ability to\ndo is multiple, Desktops, right?\n\n221\n00:11:49.785 --> 00:11:52.440\nAnd you could get to this\na couple different ways.\n\n222\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.031\nIn Mac, they call it mission control.\n\n223\n00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:56.513\nAnd if you look at my dock here,\n\n224\n00:11:56.513 --> 00:12:00.320\ndock again is kind of like what we\ncall it like in a Windows environment.\n\n225\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.790\nYou'll call it the task bar,\n\n226\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:07.020\nthey call it the dock here inside\nof your Mac operating system.\n\n227\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.750\nBut down here in the dock, you have\nwhat's known as Mission Control, right.\n\n228\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.120\nAnd I can launch Mission Control.\n\n229\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.090\nAnd if I launch that,\n\n230\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.170\nyou'll notice that I've got a couple\nof desktops already created.\n\n231\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.680\nI'm using gestures,\nthree finger swipe period.\n\n232\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.040\nThe swipe back and forth between\nthe different desktops that I have.\n\n233\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.880\nBut you can also use mission control\nto add additional desktops too.\n\n234\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.310\nSo for instance, if I add another one,\nnow it gives me a completely blank slate.\n\n235\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.125\nLet's say, I open System Preferences here.\n\n236\n00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.730\nWell I can actually switch.\n\n237\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.180\nSee that I have the two\nmultiple desktops going here?\n\n238\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.210\nAnd notice that system preferences\nisn't not here, right?\n\n239\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.670\nIt isn't inside or\nit isn't on this desktop.\n\n240\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.100\nBut, the other way you could use is,\nis you could use a gesture and\n\n241\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.160\ndo a three finger swipe up.\n\n242\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.440\nAnd it also takes you into your mission\ncontrol to get to your different\n\n243\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.300\ndesktops as well.\n\n244\n00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.190\nSo cool little feature, this is also\ninside of other Linux distros as well,\n\n245\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.940\nthe ability to switch\nbetween multiple desktops.\n\n246\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.630\nWindows, and\n\n247\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.700\nwe're not worried about in the A+ at this\npoint in the 900 series, about Windows 10.\n\n248\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.870\nWindows 10 just recently started to add\nthis feature that they now have multiple\n\n249\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.880\ndesktops, but Linux has been doing\nthis for a very long time now.\n\n250\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.985\nThey had a really cool feature that you\ncould too, you could do a 3D rotation that\n\n251\n00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:21.850\nwas really cool and some of the earliers-\n&gt;&gt; That was a cool one, I remember that.\n\n252\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.673\n&gt;&gt; Compass\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:22.673 --> 00:13:23.802\n&gt;&gt; I think was one of the softwares-\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n254\n00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.814\n&gt;&gt; That could do that, man, that was\nreally cool because what you could do is\n\n255\n00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:29.260\nyou could do a whole complete\nthree dimensional rotation.\n\n256\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.025\n&gt;&gt; It's like a cube turning on its axis.\n\n257\n00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:33.940\n&gt;&gt; And one of the thing that\nwas really cool about that,\n\n258\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.260\nDan, was the fact that one of my friends\nthat I used to go to school with\n\n259\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.940\nwhen we were studying for computers.\n\n260\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.884\nAs he would rotate the desktop,\nhe'd have something playing on YouTube and\n\n261\n00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:43.632\nyou could see right through the desktop,\nand\n\n262\n00:13:43.632 --> 00:13:46.163\nsee the other desktops keep playing\nthe video in the background.\n\n263\n00:13:46.163 --> 00:13:46.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool.\n\n264\n00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:50.420\n&gt;&gt; So, it's something that's been\naround a lot for a while now,\n\n265\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.940\nit's gain more popularity in\nadditional operating systems.\n\n266\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.895\nAgain like Windows 10, but\ndon't worry in the 900 series for\n\n267\n00:13:56.895 --> 00:14:00.696\nWindows 10 because they really only call\nout the Windows 8 operating system at this\n\n268\n00:14:00.696 --> 00:14:01.884\npoint or Windows 8.1.\n\n269\n00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:02.492\nAll right, so\n\n270\n00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:06.520\nthat takes care of a couple of the other\nthings that we need to talk about.\n\n271\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.703\nI mentioned gestures.\n\n272\n00:14:07.703 --> 00:14:11.840\nBut I just kind of said,\nhey here, a gesture right?\n\n273\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.366\nGestures are really cool cuz when you\nhave something like your trackpad,\n\n274\n00:14:16.366 --> 00:14:20.892\nright, on your laptop, it allows you\nthe ability to do just like swipes,\n\n275\n00:14:20.892 --> 00:14:24.560\nyou might also hear them call\nbased on some of the settings.\n\n276\n00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.890\nAnd you can do a lot of cool\nfeatures with it, right.\n\n277\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.218\nSo if we show my desktop again,\nif I use a three finger swipe,\n\n278\n00:14:31.218 --> 00:14:33.260\nI can go between multiple desktops.\n\n279\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.051\nRight, I can also do\na three finger swipe up and\n\n280\n00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:40.432\nthat gives me the ability to do things\nlike get into the mission control.\n\n281\n00:14:40.432 --> 00:14:47.670\nYou can manipulate how gestures\nwork inside of the MacOS here.\n\n282\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.560\nAnd we can go up to our\nlittle Apple icon here.\n\n283\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.460\nAnd I know you guys, it's kinda hard to\nsee that, so let me kind of zoom in so\n\n284\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.930\nyou guys could see what's\nkinda going on here.\n\n285\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.620\nI'm using the Apple icon, right,\nand then if we scroll down,\n\n286\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.640\nwe have our System Preferences.\n\n287\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.500\nRight and inside of our system\npreferences you'll see that,\n\n288\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.450\nI believe this is in Trackpad right here.\n\n289\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.460\nNotice Trackpad, and then notice that\nyou have, and in fact, this is kind of\n\n290\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.000\ncool cuz they've got the video here kind\nof showing you what's going on, right.\n\n291\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.370\nNow if you have like a magic pad,\n\n292\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.490\nthat's something that we\nhave like at our desks too.\n\n293\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.912\nYou could also set up a Bluetooth magic\npad or a Bluetooth trackpad maxes.\n\n294\n00:15:23.912 --> 00:15:27.328\nIt just happens to be called a magic pad,\ncuz everything's magic.\n\n295\n00:15:27.328 --> 00:15:29.784\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It magically doesn't work.\n\n296\n00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:32.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why aren't you connecting?\n\n297\n00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:33.896\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n298\n00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:39.039\n[LAUGH] So you can use those as well,\nbut noticed that I give you the ability\n\n299\n00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:44.260\nto do swipes and it shows you like\nif I select one, what are you doing?\n\n300\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.307\nAnd again, just a little gestures, right.\n\n301\n00:15:47.307 --> 00:15:51.730\nFor instance, let see,\nif I pull up the Google here, right.\n\n302\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.220\nAnd I want to zoom in right,\nthat's your pinch to zoom.\n\n303\n00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.581\nMost of you probably seen this if you've\ngot a cell phone, right, and you've opened\n\n304\n00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:03.822\nup a document or something and you do the\npinch to swipe, and it opens it up, right,\n\n305\n00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:07.397\nso You could do things like that,\ngestures are really, really good,\n\n306\n00:16:07.397 --> 00:16:11.576\nthat can make it really easy to work with\nyour track better work with your operating\n\n307\n00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:15.190\nsystem in general and really can\nkind of enhance the user experience.\n\n308\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.186\n&gt;&gt; I know we're talking Mac OS and\nLinux but I remember Microsoft and\n\n309\n00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:21.729\nSamsung I think, they did this evil, and\n\n310\n00:16:21.729 --> 00:16:27.196\nthey hand like 300 points where it would\nrecognize 300 different points contact.\n\n311\n00:16:27.196 --> 00:16:31.200\nSo like multiple people can,\nwhat do you call it?\n\n312\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.430\nWhat's the word?\n\n313\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.140\nIt starts with a C where we work together.\n\n314\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Collaborate.\n\n315\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, collaborate.\n\n316\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:35.905\nThank you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's the word I was looking for.\n\n318\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.033\nI wanna say conglomerate\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:42.491\n&gt;&gt; Collaborate on the same project at\n\n320\n00:16:42.491 --> 00:16:45.510\nthe same time is a really cool software.\n\n321\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.051\n&gt;&gt; And even earlier than that,\n\n322\n00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:50.196\nVista brought in a lot of these\nwhere they were using that,\n\n323\n00:16:50.196 --> 00:16:54.319\nI know people dont like too much about\nthis, but would bring in digitizers.\n\n324\n00:16:54.319 --> 00:16:56.880\nAnd the digitizers,\nyou could use flicks and stuff like that.\n\n325\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.730\nSo a little bit different than here,\nthan gestures in general.\n\n326\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.900\nBut yeah, they've definitely come\na long ways and the technology.\n\n327\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.835\nAllright, so that is gestures.\n\n328\n00:17:06.835 --> 00:17:09.485\nAlso they mentioned Finder.\n\n329\n00:17:09.485 --> 00:17:13.525\nFinder is kinda like what Windows, Windows\nhas Windows Explorer, File explorer,\n\n330\n00:17:13.525 --> 00:17:17.137\ndepending on which generation of Windows\nyou're looking at, Windows seven.\n\n331\n00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:19.057\nThey call it Windows Explorer\nup until Windows 7.\n\n332\n00:17:19.057 --> 00:17:21.367\nAnd then beyond that,\nthey call it File Explorer.\n\n333\n00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:24.917\nWell, Finder is basically the file and\nfolder or\n\n334\n00:17:24.917 --> 00:17:28.647\ndirectory utility that you use in the\ngraphical user interface in order to be\n\n335\n00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:31.977\nable to work with your files and\nfolders and applications.\n\n336\n00:17:31.977 --> 00:17:34.577\nPretty much everything inside\nof the Mac operating system.\n\n337\n00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:36.094\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n338\n00:17:36.094 --> 00:17:38.590\nSo if you have left your dock the same,\n\n339\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.450\nyou have Finder down here in\nthe lower left hand corner.\n\n340\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.530\nUnderstand that if you click the desktop,\nand\n\n341\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.885\nyou make the desktop the focus,\nyou also have Finder up here.\n\n342\n00:17:48.885 --> 00:17:51.755\nHere too, so you can use this right\nfrom the menu bar as well, so\n\n343\n00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:54.275\nit depends on how you wanna launch this,\nand\n\n344\n00:17:54.275 --> 00:17:59.935\nyou can launch basically,\nyou can launch your finder, right?\n\n345\n00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:04.075\nAnd you can see here that on\nthe left-hand side of the screen here,\n\n346\n00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:05.925\nwe have kind of like the hierarchy, right?\n\n347\n00:18:05.925 --> 00:18:07.205\nWe have favorites here,\n\n348\n00:18:07.205 --> 00:18:10.185\nwe've got your devices, these\nare different devices that are available.\n\n349\n00:18:10.185 --> 00:18:13.720\nYou can see, for instance,\nmy passport here,\n\n350\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.760\nthe drive that I'm using for\ntime machine is here.\n\n351\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.790\nRemote disk,\nremote disk is very, very cool.\n\n352\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.670\nThis is kind of a cool utility because\nknow one of the things that you're not\n\n353\n00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.130\nreally seeing in laptops anymore?\n\n354\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.280\nDVD drives, optical drives, right.\n\n355\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.030\nWhere we're basically going to solid state\nmedia, and we're using USB thumb drives.\n\n356\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:36.400\nWell remote disk is a great way that\net's say Dan's computer Supported DVD,\n\n357\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.020\nthe optical drive.\n\n358\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.360\nDVD sharing.\n\n359\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.470\nWell, guess what?\n\n360\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.780\nI could click Remote Disk, and\n\n361\n00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.990\nif it is available,\nI could basically use his optical drive.\n\n362\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.490\nRight?\nThat's a great little thing to have\n\n363\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.150\nbecause of the fact that,\nfor the most part,\n\n364\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.600\nyour laptops don't have\noptical drives anymore.\n\n365\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.850\nSo you can also see\nthat in Finder as well.\n\n366\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.070\nYou can manipulate the way Finder looks.\n\n367\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.800\nRight.\nWe got different ways to look.\n\n368\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.890\nLet me go ahead and\nget back up here to the top.\n\n369\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.970\nHere we go.\nSo I can if I want,\n\n370\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.900\nit depends on what kind\nof view you might want.\n\n371\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.339\nHere comes the gestures again.\n\n372\n00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:09.400\nI'm gonna two finger swipe at the top.\n\n373\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.910\nI can also change this to traditional like\nfile or directory hierarchy if I want.\n\n374\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.130\nAnd then you got potentials\nto do like your right clicks.\n\n375\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:26.570\nAgain if we do a right click inside of\nyour Finder window, well you can also\n\n376\n00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:32.720\ndo things like right clicks here as well\ntoo, as well as sharing files and folders.\n\n377\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.390\nSo a lot of different things you can do,\n\n378\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.170\nyou can even search pretty much\nthrough your hard drive for\n\n379\n00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.670\ndifferent files and for directories your\nfolders if you want all inside the Finder.\n\n380\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:48.640\nSo pretty much just know what Finder it is\nand also know what remote disk is as well.\n\n381\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:55.840\nThat moves us into one other thing that\nwe have to be aware of inside of our\n\n382\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:02.440\nMac OS is something\nthat's known as iCloud.\n\n383\n00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.000\niCloud is another thing\nthat you can get through if\n\n384\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.280\nwe go to our menu bar here to the top and\nwe choose go.\n\n385\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.160\nAnd then we go to,\nactually I say applications and\n\n386\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.720\nI'm gonna tell you right now.\n\n387\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.810\nIt's not an application.\n\n388\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.305\nSo let me close this down and get you\nto the right side of the river here.\n\n389\n00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:21.861\nLet's try that again, so if I go to Go,\n\n390\n00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:25.811\nyou'll notice that iCloud Drive\nis right there in the left,\n\n391\n00:20:25.811 --> 00:20:30.630\nright so that's gives me the ability\nof merging this to launch up iCloud.\n\n392\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm blown away.\n\n393\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.076\n&gt;&gt; Glad you came to the episode.\n\n394\n00:20:37.076 --> 00:20:37.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n395\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.700\nkeep in mind that this is\ntheir cloud-based solution.\n\n396\n00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.990\nYou can also back up your\ndevices to iCloud if you want.\n\n397\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.790\nYou can restore them down from iCloud.\n\n398\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.260\nGreat thing to have,\n\n399\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.060\nespecially you know at Microsoft\nthey have things like One Drive.\n\n400\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.820\nYou probably heard of\nGoogle Drive out there.\n\n401\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.470\nSo most of the major platforms have them.\n\n402\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.180\nWell guess what?\n\n403\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.490\nApple isn't short on their\ncloud based solution too.\n\n404\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.520\nThis is their Software as a Service.\n\n405\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.860\nBased solution there and\n\n406\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.400\nit's integrated right into your Mac OS as\nwell as things like your iPads, iPhones.\n\n407\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.560\nI've never owned an iPod, so I don't know.\n\n408\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.910\nI can only imagine that\nif it's part of the iOS,\n\n409\n00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.210\nthen it's also going to be an iPod.\n\n410\n00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's there's as well we have, very good.\n\n411\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.290\nAll right so that's a few more, the\nutilities that we gotta needed to know.\n\n412\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.460\nThere are a couple of other things, right.\n\n413\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.314\nThey mention something known as well,\nKeychain.\n\n414\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.660\nAnd Keychain is basically a place to\nstore things like your certificates,\n\n415\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.770\nauthentication credentials,\nif you will and you can also get to that.\n\n416\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.730\nKeep in mind that you do happen to\nbe an administrator to get there.\n\n417\n00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.723\nAnd the way we get to key chain is to,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n418\n00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:43.491\nwe'll go to our menu bar again.\n\n419\n00:21:43.491 --> 00:21:44.827\nWe'll go to Go.\n\n420\n00:21:44.827 --> 00:21:45.971\nWell, that's redundant.\n\n421\n00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll launch utilities.\n\n422\n00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.710\nAnd I believe in utilities,\nhere yeah, Keychain access.\n\n423\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.980\nThere you go, you got it right there.\n\n424\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.130\nAnd we can launch this up.\n\n425\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.533\nAnd I don't know how much of this I wanna\nshow on screen, I will show all of it.\n\n426\n00:21:59.533 --> 00:22:02.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you could see the different things\n\n427\n00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.470\nthat I've log into as well like\nthings like my Apple ID, right.\n\n428\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.600\nAnd again is more about authentication and\nmanaging certificates and\n\n429\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.540\nstuff Surrounding passwords as well,\nall there in key chain.\n\n430\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.432\nYou can see some of the encryption\ninformation right there, right?\n\n431\n00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:20.990\nRSA encryption, and it shows me what\nthe key length is and what the usage is.\n\n432\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.060\nSo again, keep in mind that does\nrequire administrative access.\n\n433\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.968\nThere are some times that\nyou have to get in there.\n\n434\n00:22:25.968 --> 00:22:27.220\nI've had to get in there before,\n\n435\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.770\nbecause some certificate\nmismatches have happened before.\n\n436\n00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.010\nI can't remember what I was doing, I think\nI was SSHing from a terminal on the MAC\n\n437\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.670\ninto a sent box, and the RSA key or\nsomething like that had change or\n\n438\n00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.650\nsomething like that so\nI had to get down in here and\n\n439\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.910\nI had to basically delete the SSH key for\nwhatever reason.\n\n440\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.980\nAgain, your average end users a lot of\ntimes will never have anything to do with\n\n441\n00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.456\nthat and\nif you want more information about Mac OS.\n\n442\n00:22:54.456 --> 00:23:00.650\nDon Prezet,\none of our host brilliant SME has done\n\n443\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.740\na whole entire series on Mac that you can\nreally, really get down in depth on map.\n\n444\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.430\nAll right.\nNow,\n\n445\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.940\none of the other things\nthat they also call out,\n\n446\n00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.650\nthat is specific to Mac is\nsomething known as Boot Camp.\n\n447\n00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.560\nNow Boot Camp is kind of interesting.\n\n448\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.029\nLet's say that you had a necessity that\nwhat you wanted to do is you wanted\n\n449\n00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:25.243\nto run the Windows operating system,\nbut you have a Mac, all right?\n\n450\n00:23:25.243 --> 00:23:27.544\nNow that sometimes isn't very uncommon.\n\n451\n00:23:27.544 --> 00:23:28.804\nIt's not uncommon,\n\n452\n00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:32.584\nactually it's very common to do\nthat is what I'm trying to say.\n\n453\n00:23:32.584 --> 00:23:36.389\nBecause we have to do this, and\nwe have to do this a lot, right?\n\n454\n00:23:36.389 --> 00:23:37.970\nWe do this through virtualization.\n\n455\n00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.580\nIn fact, if you'll see if I go back to my\nscreen here real quick you'll see that I\n\n456\n00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.860\nhave VMware, right.\n\n457\n00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.230\nVMware has their own set of drivers\nthat allows you to virtualize.\n\n458\n00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.890\nWe've talked about virtualization in\nother episodes here in the 902 Series.\n\n459\n00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.230\nThere's some times some functionalities\nthat are lost in virtualization.\n\n460\n00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:01.890\nAnd what you don't need is that software\ntype two hypervisor in between.\n\n461\n00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.354\nYou need access to the raw hardware,\nright?\n\n462\n00:24:04.354 --> 00:24:06.620\nAnd maybe, you'd need to do this\nin a Windows environment, right?\n\n463\n00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.048\nSo I would lose some of the functionality.\n\n464\n00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:12.346\nLike for instance, if I was to boot up my\nWindows operating system right here, one\n\n465\n00:24:12.346 --> 00:24:16.421\nof the things that VMware would not allow\nme to do is see the wireless adapter.\n\n466\n00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:19.905\nSo if I wanted to do anything to show\nyou guys wireless communications,\n\n467\n00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:23.631\nI have to get my Windows machine out\nwithout plug, which isn't a bad thing.\n\n468\n00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:26.514\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you can plug\nin a USB wireless adapter and\n\n469\n00:24:26.514 --> 00:24:28.345\nit would detect that as wireless.\n\n470\n00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n471\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.807\n&gt;&gt; But if I need physical access to\nthe hardware of inside the machine,\n\n472\n00:24:31.807 --> 00:24:33.669\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a little more [INAUDIBLE].\n\n473\n00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:35.142\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where Boot Camp comes in, right?\n\n474\n00:24:35.142 --> 00:24:35.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n475\n00:24:35.758 --> 00:24:37.555\n&gt;&gt; And that's essentially what Boot Camp,\n\n476\n00:24:37.555 --> 00:24:41.340\nin fact, I went ahead and did a Boot Camp\nfor one of the shows that we're gonna do.\n\n477\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.017\nWe really didn't do it for this show, but\nI can kinda show you what's going on here.\n\n478\n00:24:44.017 --> 00:24:48.680\nSo if we take a look at my screen here,\ndon't get into the Boot Camp drive itself.\n\n479\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.294\nThat's actually storing Windows.\n\n480\n00:24:50.294 --> 00:24:53.622\nIn fact, you can do a Cmd + I on\nthis if you want to forget info or\n\n481\n00:24:53.622 --> 00:24:55.039\njust right-click on it.\n\n482\n00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:57.742\nYou can actually see,\nI believe, yeah, there we go.\n\n483\n00:24:57.742 --> 00:25:02.410\nIt says, NT FS or\nthe New Technology File System.\n\n484\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.349\nThis is actually a 60-gig drive.\n\n485\n00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:10.313\nIt's actually a 60-gig partition that\nI created when I installed Windows,\n\n486\n00:25:10.313 --> 00:25:13.160\nbasically, like a dual-boot situation.\n\n487\n00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.800\nSo, for instance, if we,\nI'm trying to remember.\n\n488\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.220\nWhere is Boot Camp?\n\n489\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.360\nI wanna say, it's in Applet.\n\n490\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.209\nIt might be in Utilities.\n\n491\n00:25:19.209 --> 00:25:21.928\nThe Boot Camp Assistant, yes, there we go.\n\n492\n00:25:21.928 --> 00:25:24.660\nAnd you could see right here that we\nhave the Boot Camp Assistant, right?\n\n493\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.700\nAnd if I launch this up,\nthis would give me the ability\n\n494\n00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.890\nto basically install Windows operating\nsystem right on this machine.\n\n495\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.214\nAnd yeah, it's not gonna see it,\nI don't believe, yeah.\n\n496\n00:25:34.214 --> 00:25:38.910\nSo it wants to do a restore because\nI've already got Windows on here.\n\n497\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.127\nAnd now, essentially,\nwe could do a dual-boot.\n\n498\n00:25:40.127 --> 00:25:42.245\nNow, let me go ahead.\n\n499\n00:25:42.245 --> 00:25:44.629\nWhat I'm gonna do is since we've already\ngot this, I'm gonna close this down.\n\n500\n00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:47.783\nAnd what I could do is I could turn it\naround and I could restart this machine.\n\n501\n00:25:47.783 --> 00:25:50.475\nAnd essentially,\nI can launch in the Windows, right?\n\n502\n00:25:50.475 --> 00:25:54.052\nI can restart the machine, and\nI'm natively launched right on the Windows\n\n503\n00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:56.920\noperating system and\nI have access to the hardware.\n\n504\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.552\nI don't know if we can show, I'm not sure.\n\n505\n00:25:58.552 --> 00:26:01.063\nWe're gonna try this one here,\nand why not?\n\n506\n00:26:01.063 --> 00:26:05.120\nLet's go ahead, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna restart our machine.\n\n507\n00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.406\nNow, be careful cuz once you do this,\n\n508\n00:26:07.406 --> 00:26:11.631\n[LAUGH] your operating MAC is always\ngonna boot to Windows, all right?\n\n509\n00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:16.539\nYou have to hold the Option\nbutton down during the boot time.\n\n510\n00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:19.602\nAnd let me see if it will actually-\n&gt;&gt; Hold the button down with Mac to make\n\n511\n00:26:19.602 --> 00:26:20.865\nit do something you want it to do.\n\n512\n00:26:20.865 --> 00:26:21.768\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:23.563\n&gt;&gt; And here, I can hear a rant coming on.\n\n514\n00:26:23.563 --> 00:26:26.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Boy, when we stop this episode, right?\n\n515\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.410\nSo let me [LAUGH] go ahead,\nI'm gonna restart this.\n\n516\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.720\nAnd we'll see how well this works here.\n\n517\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.887\nSo maybe,\nyou guys will get a chance to see that.\n\n518\n00:26:34.887 --> 00:26:38.775\nAnd actually, it's doing a graceful\nshutdown in Ubuntu operating system\n\n519\n00:26:38.775 --> 00:26:40.586\nbecause apparently, I didn't.\n\n520\n00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:42.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we'll go ahead and\n\n521\n00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:45.437\nwe'll let the Ubuntu\noperating system shut down.\n\n522\n00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:49.726\nAnd essentially, what's gonna\nhappen is it's gonna do a graceful\n\n523\n00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:52.220\nshutdown on the Mac operating system.\n\n524\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.531\nAnd what it should do is boot into or\njust turn around and reboot this machine.\n\n525\n00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:58.846\nAnd I'm hoping what we're gonna see\nhere is we're gonna actually see it turn\n\n526\n00:26:58.846 --> 00:27:00.181\naround and boot into Windows.\n\n527\n00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:05.730\nNow, if it doesn't, I can see, I can feel\naccess to the track pad in the background.\n\n528\n00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.210\nSo it does look like\nthat it's booting here.\n\n529\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.660\nBut again, and you know what?\n\n530\n00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.250\nIt might try to boot to the, there we go.\n\n531\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.827\nAnd I don't know if you guys\ncould see that out there.\n\n532\n00:27:13.827 --> 00:27:17.390\nI do have a Windows boot\nscreen here in the background.\n\n533\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.660\nAnd we will see if it gets started here.\n\n534\n00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.200\nYou can't really see it\non the screen right now.\n\n535\n00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.543\nSo we're gonna have to figure\nout what's going on here.\n\n536\n00:27:23.543 --> 00:27:24.563\nMight just be a driver issue.\n\n537\n00:27:24.563 --> 00:27:26.287\n&gt;&gt; I would say it's probably\na driver issue, yeah.\n\n538\n00:27:26.287 --> 00:27:28.093\n&gt;&gt; Probably a driver,\nthere we go, [LAUGH] perfect.\n\n539\n00:27:28.093 --> 00:27:29.322\n&gt;&gt; There we go, drivers have kicked in.\n\n540\n00:27:29.322 --> 00:27:31.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, the drivers are there.\n\n541\n00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:32.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n542\n00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.267\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that I do\nhave the option of boot right\n\n543\n00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:37.155\ninto a Windows operating system.\n\n544\n00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:40.080\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna restart this.\n\n545\n00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.540\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold\nin the Option button and restart it.\n\n546\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.470\nI just wanted to show you that you\nguys have seen what the windows\n\n547\n00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.230\noperating system.\n\n548\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:53.220\nThis is Windows 10, again, don't worry\nabout Windows 10 for this, the 900 series.\n\n549\n00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.769\nBut it shows you what Boot Camp\ngives you the ability to do.\n\n550\n00:27:55.769 --> 00:28:00.882\nAnd now, I'm rebooting the machine and I\ndon't see that it is gonna show you that.\n\n551\n00:28:00.882 --> 00:28:05.315\nBut again, you do get the ability\nto choose the Mac drive.\n\n552\n00:28:05.315 --> 00:28:07.455\nAnd that's what I'm gonna go ahead and do.\n\n553\n00:28:07.455 --> 00:28:12.290\nSo I get to reboot right\nback into the Mac OS.\n\n554\n00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.240\nAnd again, now, the Mac OS is taking\ncontrol basically of the hardware like\n\n555\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.310\nwe've talked in other episodes when\nyou do a multi-boot situation.\n\n556\n00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.794\nAnd what you should see here in a second\nis that we get the login screen.\n\n557\n00:28:22.794 --> 00:28:28.801\nAnd just like that, I could type in\nmy super secret password of 123456,\n\n558\n00:28:28.801 --> 00:28:31.631\nand I can log back into this machine.\n\n559\n00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:34.929\nNow, Dan, that really takes care of,\nand there is one more thing.\n\n560\n00:28:34.929 --> 00:28:37.733\nI'm gonna go Colombo on you on\nthis one like I like to do so\n\n561\n00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:39.115\nmany other times, right?\n\n562\n00:28:39.115 --> 00:28:42.189\nLet me go ahead and\nshut that AirServer down here.\n\n563\n00:28:42.189 --> 00:28:45.913\nAnd let's say that I've got an application\n\n564\n00:28:45.913 --> 00:28:50.046\nthat just doesn't wanna play nice,\nall right?\n\n565\n00:28:50.046 --> 00:28:52.060\nSo I went ahead and launched up Chrome.\n\n566\n00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.650\nAnd I'm not picking on\nChrome by any means.\n\n567\n00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.380\nBut let's say that this application\nhangs on me, all right?\n\n568\n00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.420\nIt locks up and I can't shut it down.\n\n569\n00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.360\nI got some options here.\n\n570\n00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.448\n&gt;&gt; You go to the Task Manager, wait.\n\n571\n00:29:02.448 --> 00:29:04.573\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bad, wrong operating system, Dan,\n\n572\n00:29:04.573 --> 00:29:05.150\nthat's right.\n\n573\n00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.916\n&gt;&gt; But it works really well for me.\n\n574\n00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:07.132\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, wrong side of the river.\n\n575\n00:29:07.132 --> 00:29:07.732\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n576\n00:29:07.732 --> 00:29:10.120\nhe is right if we're [LAUGH] in Windows,\nright?\n\n577\n00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.775\nSo what we can do is we can actually\ndo what's known as a Force Quit.\n\n578\n00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:16.825\nYou might hear this in\nthe Android operating system.\n\n579\n00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:18.295\nThey call it a Force Stop.\n\n580\n00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:19.715\nI mean, pretty much the same thing.\n\n581\n00:29:19.715 --> 00:29:24.475\nTask kill, process kill inside of Linux,\nright, issuing a command.\n\n582\n00:29:24.475 --> 00:29:27.825\nAnd there's a way that\nyou can actually do this.\n\n583\n00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:31.135\nNotice, if I right-click on\nthe icon that's in the Dock here,\n\n584\n00:29:31.135 --> 00:29:32.630\nI don't see what I want.\n\n585\n00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.520\nBut the moment I basically,\nlet's see here.\n\n586\n00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.750\nLet me zoom in so\nthat you guys can see that.\n\n587\n00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.380\nI'm holding the Option button.\n\n588\n00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And what happens here is it allows me\n\n589\n00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.700\nthe ability to do a Force Quit.\n\n590\n00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:49.790\nI wanna say, the other way that you can\ndo this too is with the Activity Monitor.\n\n591\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.372\nAnd I can't remember, I believe you can.\n\n592\n00:29:53.372 --> 00:29:58.560\nYou can go to, yeah, so\nyou can go to Google Chrome here.\n\n593\n00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.870\nAnd notice this option up here,\nForce a process to quit.\n\n594\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.400\nIt doesn't say force quit on it.\n\n595\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:04.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n596\n00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.110\nthat's what they call out Force Quit,\nso I just wanted to show you that.\n\n597\n00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.040\nBut that's another way that you can do\nthat with the Activity Monitor as well.\n\n598\n00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040\nAgain, keep in mind,\n\n599\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:18.160\nall you have to do is right-click on\nwhatever the application is in the Dock.\n\n600\n00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.760\nAnd just hold down your Alt key or\nyour Option key.\n\n601\n00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.030\nAnd that gives you\nthe ability to Force Quit it.\n\n602\n00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.080\nAnd you can shut it down.\n\n603\n00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.120\nAnd notice that one of the things about\nthe Dock here is if an application is\n\n604\n00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.310\nactive and it's open or, well,\nlet me be careful with that.\n\n605\n00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.763\nIt could be open and it has a dot under\nit, but it can be closed and still active.\n\n606\n00:30:37.763 --> 00:30:39.980\nHence, why you might\nneed to do a Force Quit.\n\n607\n00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.550\nWhen that dot goes away, you can see that\nyou've actually killed the application.\n\n608\n00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.540\nIf you still think that you\nhaven't killed the application,\n\n609\n00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.730\nlaunch your Activity Monitor, right?\n\n610\n00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.720\nAnd you can find whatever the process is.\n\n611\n00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.060\nMake sure that it's an application.\n\n612\n00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.230\nYou don't wanna start messing with\nprocesses that are in here [LAUGH]\n\n613\n00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.800\nbecause they could be system processes and\nthat could cost you some problems here.\n\n614\n00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.170\nBut you could find\nwhatever the problem is,\n\n615\n00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.080\nlike I know I can kill Flux here and\nit's not gonna cause a problem here.\n\n616\n00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.691\nAnd I could do Kill, and\nit asks me if I wanna do a Force Quit.\n\n617\n00:31:11.691 --> 00:31:15.230\nAnd when I do that, they apparently,\nthere it goes, it's gone.\n\n618\n00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.683\nSo, couple different ways\nthat you can do that.\n\n619\n00:31:16.683 --> 00:31:20.390\nNow, then, it does look like we're gonna\nmight have a little small part 3 in this\n\n620\n00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.581\none because we still got some Linux\ncommands that we gotta talk about.\n\n621\n00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.640\nBut I know, we don't have time.\n\n622\n00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.860\n&gt;&gt; No, we're fresh out of time for today,\nbut at least this episode, should I say.\n\n623\n00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.457\nSo we will do that, very good,\na part 3, I'm loving it.\n\n624\n00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:36.220\nMelvin, never I say, gonna give us more\ntime to focus on the Linux side of things.\n\n625\n00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.971\nMake sure we're not\nrushing through anything.\n\n626\n00:31:37.971 --> 00:31:40.095\nMake sure all that pertinent information\nis there for you guys out there.\n\n627\n00:31:40.095 --> 00:31:41.832\nWes, thanks so much for joining us today.\n\n628\n00:31:41.832 --> 00:31:44.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Teaching us all that you've taught us.\n\n629\n00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.400\nLooking forward to seeing what\nelse you got on the plate.\n\n630\n00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.240\nJoin us then, so this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n631\n00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.470\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n632\n00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n633\n00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:52.820\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

All right, greetings, everyone, welcome\nback to another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.849\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.790\nwell we're continuing on\nwith more in our A+ series.\n\n11\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.250\nTrying to actually finish up our\nconversation about Mac OS features and\n\n12\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.160\nLinux operating system features, as well.\n\n13\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460\nJoining us in the studio to continue\ntalking about that very thing,\n\n14\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.820\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.830\nWes, welcome back sir, we're so\ngood to have you again.\n\n16\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.030\n&gt;&gt; Hey man thanks for having me back.\n\n17\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.860\nThat's right, we are finishing up the last\nlittle bit that we gotta talk about and\n\n18\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.930\nthat is some basic Linux commands.\n\n19\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.540\nYes, those of you that maybe were\nseeing a command prompt, and\n\n20\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.213\nif you were like me when I was an A+\nstudent, the first time I seen\n\n21\n00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:52.940\na command prompt inside of a Windows\noperating system it made my skin crawl.\n\n22\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.240\nAnd I'm like, my gosh,\nwhat the heck did I get myself into?\n\n23\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.485\nWell, as this exam, CompTIA has\nmatured this exam, if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:05.367\nThey now want you to know a handful\nof basic Linux commands too.\n\n25\n00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:11.827\nSo that is something that you might\nbe responsible for on the exam.\n\n26\n00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:14.487\nAll right now,\ndon't let it make you nervous, right,\n\n27\n00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:18.197\nyou don't have to be, you know,\na Linux administrator by any means.\n\n28\n00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:21.007\nYou know, I'm telling you, be the first\none to tell you, I'm not, I understand\n\n29\n00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:24.737\nsome of the basic commands too and\nI've got people like Dan by my side.\n\n30\n00:01:24.737 --> 00:01:26.147\nYou know, I've got people like Don Pezet,\n\n31\n00:01:26.147 --> 00:01:30.537\nanother one of our host on SMEs here\nthat are pretty much Linux gurus.\n\n32\n00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:32.890\nAnd guess what,\nI also have search engines too.\n\n33\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.260\nSo you do have the ability to\nbasically practice these commands, and\n\n34\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.720\nyou do have a lot of\nresources at your disposal.\n\n35\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.240\nBut one of the great things, too, that\nyou have at your disposal, disposable?\n\n36\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.985\nDisposal.\n\n37\n00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:51.150\n[LAUGH] Is help options inside\nof your shell or your terminal,\n\n38\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.550\njust like you do inside of a Windows\ncommand prompt when we talk about putting\n\n39\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.710\na space forward slash question mark to\nany command that you might be typing.\n\n40\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.090\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive right in and\n\n41\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.250\nI actually have a terminal\nalready open here.\n\n42\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.870\nKeep in mind that you can use the,\nyou know if you're running Unity,\n\n43\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.140\nyou can use a little search functionality\nto and you can always type terminal.\n\n44\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.580\nAnd you can launch up your terminal,\nso very easy to get to.\n\n45\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.790\nI really like the Unity desktop here,\n\n46\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.940\nthey make it kinda easy,\nwhich is kinda what they wanna do.\n\n47\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.080\nYou know overall when it comes to\nUbuntu experience, you don't have to be\n\n48\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.150\none of these Linux gurus that really just\nrely on this text based input and output.\n\n49\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.820\nBecause in the earlier days of\nthe Linux operating system,\n\n50\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.870\nyou didn't have this\ngraphical user interface.\n\n51\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.020\nYou had to interact pretty much,\nwould you say that's right Dan,\n\n52\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.970\nwith the terminal just to\neven be able to run Linux?\n\n53\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah back in the heyday, back in my day\nwe only had these terminal-based things,\n\n54\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.130\nwe didn't have no graphical stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.830\nIt's true, you didn't have a nice X,\nit wasn't out quite yet.\n\n56\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.850\nX did come along pretty quickly\nafterward I would think, but yeah,\n\n57\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.750\nyou're gonna spend a lot of time in this\nlittle boxy box here, typey, typey thing.\n\n58\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, you know we have many, and\n\n59\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.230\nyou have so many different GUIs today that\nyou can put on different Linux flavors,\n\n60\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.330\nright Unity,\nhappens to the one here in Ubuntu.\n\n61\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.550\nBut you have things like Katie and\nGnome, Enlightenment,\n\n62\n00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.480\nI believe, is another one that's out\nthere too, just a handful of them.\n\n63\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.560\nBut again,\n\n64\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.020\nthe terminal really isn't much different\nin what you see in command prompt.\n\n65\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.722\nIn fact you probably say\nwell you can say this,\n\n66\n00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:27.610\nterminal was around before\ncommand prompt was ever around.\n\n67\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.170\nSo you do have some commands,\nthey kind of stay the same.\n\n68\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.740\nLike for instance the dir command, the dir\ncommand is something that you can run\n\n69\n00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.880\ninside of Windows just like you can run\ninside of your Linux operating system,\n\n70\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.870\ncuz that actually started earlier\nthan both of them, started in Unix.\n\n71\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.400\nSo you can run that, but even more than\nthat, you can also run what's know as,\n\n72\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.890\nI believe it's called List right?\n\n73\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.130\nThe list command, ls, and\n\n74\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.440\nyou'll see that it's pretty much\ndoing the same thing as well.\n\n75\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.220\n&gt;&gt; It's doing a little bit better though.\n\n76\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is right, so the colors,\nI could tell the difference between a file\n\n77\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.240\nand I could tell the difference\nbetween a directory.\n\n78\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.790\nNow correct me if I'm wrong Dan,\n\n79\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.790\nthat really depends on the flavor\nof Linux you're in, right?\n\n80\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.050\n&gt;&gt; The flavor, yeah, but specifically,\n\n81\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.140\nthe aliasing that has been\nbuilt in to the system itself.\n\n82\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.262\nYou can do all that afterwards,\nif you just get a standard vanilla,\n\n83\n00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:23.871\nout-of-the-box terminal, it might not\nhave this coloration scheme available.\n\n84\n00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:26.130\nBut you can go in there and modify it so\n\n85\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.160\nthat it would have that\nregardless what favor you're in.\n\n86\n00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good, very good.\n\n87\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.340\nAnd what if you don't know\nmuch about the ls command?\n\n88\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.000\nWhat if you don't know much\nabout the dir command, right?\n\n89\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.910\nWell that's one of the great things\nthough, keep in mind a little bit\n\n90\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.845\ndifferent than Windows for those of you\nthere maybe you're familiar with Windows.\n\n91\n00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:48.670\nWe like to take a command and\nwe do a dir/forward?\n\n92\n00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.370\nIt doesn't work here in the Linux world,\ninside of Linux,\n\n93\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.770\nyou're gonna do a space and --help, and\nthat's where you get your information.\n\n94\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.930\nNow, that gives you a little\nbit of information.\n\n95\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Quick and dirty.\n\n96\n00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.380\nHere's the vast majority of what\nyou're probably looking for\n\n97\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.300\nreally quickly laid out for you.\n\n98\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.700\nThe big dog is man.\n\n99\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.716\n&gt;&gt; Man, right so we're gonna go ahead and,\n\n100\n00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:15.060\nnow here's another one that completely\ndiffers from Windows altogether.\n\n101\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.130\nBecause in Windows we told you and\nDan, you were in that episode with me,\n\n102\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.190\nwe told you that you type the command,\nspace, forward slash,\n\n103\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.061\nquestion mark gives you the syntax and\nhow to use it.\n\n104\n00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:28.620\nMan is a little bit different, so\nlet me go ahead and clear the screen here,\n\n105\n00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.860\ngive us a little bit more real estate.\n\n106\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:37.420\nMan is actually placed before the command,\nman dir, and boy we get the manual pages.\n\n107\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.780\nManual, man page if you will, and\nthis gives us a lot of information.\n\n108\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.040\nSo you can see there\nis tons of information\n\n109\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.670\nwhen it comes to the man pages.\n\n110\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.660\nRemember that, now manned pages\naren't here and even dash dash help,\n\n111\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.230\nthey don't mention like they do in the\nearlier command prompt episodes where they\n\n112\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.170\nspecifically say in your objectives,\ncommand or\n\n113\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.130\nspace forward slash question\nmark to let you know.\n\n114\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.820\nYou really wanna know those, they help\nme a lot and, in fact, they helped\n\n115\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.165\nme prepare for this episode, to understand\nwhat some of these commands are.\n\n116\n00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:14.390\nCuz for\nme I don't use them on a daily basis.\n\n117\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.690\nNow, how do we get out of the main pages?\n\n118\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.570\nQ, you can't Ctrl+C that one [LAUGH].\n\n119\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.986\nSometimes we talk about there\nare some that you can Ctrl+C, but\n\n120\n00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:26.690\nnot with the man page, Q for Quit.\n\n121\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.722\nAll right so, ls,\nls can show you some basic information,\n\n122\n00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:35.413\nit could also show you things like\nit could show you the oops, right?\n\n123\n00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:40.880\nIt could also show you things like\npermissions and a lot more information.\n\n124\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.100\nSo it really depends on how much\ninformation you need to see.\n\n125\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.180\nIf you just want quick, I wanna see what\nis in the current directory that I'm at?\n\n126\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.860\nAll I'm gonna do is type ls,\nit shows me what's in this directory.\n\n127\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.320\nNow you might need to do\na little bit of navigation.\n\n128\n00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.080\nMaybe I need to do\na little navigation here.\n\n129\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.180\nWell, guess what, It also has a Unix-based\ncommand that works in Windows,\n\n130\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.720\nworks in in Unix and\nworks in Linux too, and that's cd.\n\n131\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.915\nAnd again, if you need to know cd, you\ncould always push --help if you just need,\n\n132\n00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:15.262\nit doesn't have.\n\n133\n00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:16.321\n&gt;&gt; No, you can't.\n\n134\n00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:20.615\n&gt;&gt; No you can't apparently,\n&gt;&gt; Not everything has a help option.\n\n135\n00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:21.395\n&gt;&gt; No manual entry.\n\n136\n00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:23.555\n&gt;&gt; You just go into the man page.\n\n137\n00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:25.195\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha, gotcha.\n\n138\n00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.340\nSo let me go ahead and clear this and\nactually type this right.\n\n139\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.070\nYou can do the cd, and what I can do is I\ncan do the full path or the relative path.\n\n140\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.900\nDot forward slash say hey, take\nthe directory that I'm currently in, and\n\n141\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.450\nnow move me up in this way,\nup a directory.\n\n142\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.400\nNow here's something I want you\nto be careful about in Linux.\n\n143\n00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.793\nLet me go ahead and let me type desktop.\n\n144\n00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:55.058\nDidn't find it, you have to be careful,\nLinux, Unix based operating systems,\n\n145\n00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:59.889\neven MAC because it's BSD under the hood,\nIt's case sensitive, right?\n\n146\n00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.787\nI can think of one command off the top of\nmy head and it's about the only one I know\n\n147\n00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:07.823\nin Windows operating system that has\na case sensitivity, and that's nbtstat.\n\n148\n00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:08.947\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n149\n00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:12.080\nBig difference between an uppercase A and\na lowercase A,\n\n150\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.373\nright or an uppercase R and a lowercase R.\n\n151\n00:08:14.373 --> 00:08:16.389\nIt is case sensitive here.\n\n152\n00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:19.100\nSo if I do a cd space, right?\n\n153\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.912\nAnd I do, we'll just do the relative path,\n./, that's the other thing too,\n\n154\n00:08:22.912 --> 00:08:24.830\nforward slash rather than back slashes.\n\n155\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I do believe that\nforward slashes work in Windows now.\n\n156\n00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:29.462\n&gt;&gt; They work in Windows now?\n\n157\n00:08:29.462 --> 00:08:32.029\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's Windows 8.1 but\nI know it's in 10.\n\n158\n00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.736\n&gt;&gt; In 10, yeah,\n\n159\n00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.727\nbecause they did some major overhaul\nto the command prompted as well.\n\n160\n00:08:35.727 --> 00:08:36.621\nYou can do copy and\n\n161\n00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.267\npaste a little bit differently which\nis kinda really cool there as well.\n\n162\n00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:44.533\nBut if we look at the cd option here,\nwe get the ability if I type,\n\n163\n00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:46.590\nlet me just type d, all right?\n\n164\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.089\nI can actually use our tab functionality,\nand\n\n165\n00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:51.918\nI can find kinda like an LS,\nalmost like LS, right?\n\n166\n00:08:51.918 --> 00:08:55.286\nI can find what other directories\nstart with a letter D, all right?\n\n167\n00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:58.511\nSo if you get to a certain\namount of characters, and\n\n168\n00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:03.994\nit can kinda delineate what you're talking\nabout, you just hit tab, and guess what?\n\n169\n00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:06.472\nNow I can go to and move change directory.\n\n170\n00:09:06.472 --> 00:09:07.741\nI always say that in my head for the exam.\n\n171\n00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:08.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n172\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.649\n&gt;&gt; Cd change directory, so you can see\nexactly what is gonna allow you to do.\n\n173\n00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:15.926\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned that the dot\nslash is implied, correct?\n\n174\n00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.844\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Within the current directory.\n\n175\n00:09:17.844 --> 00:09:20.565\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely,\nyou don't have to put it, right?\n\n176\n00:09:20.565 --> 00:09:24.679\nI could do a cd, actually let me see,\ncd cuz it's Unix.\n\n177\n00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:25.662\n&gt;&gt; Which backs you up.\n\n178\n00:09:25.662 --> 00:09:28.751\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, backs you up, just like I\nshowed the command prompt, right?\n\n179\n00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:33.391\nAnd just like, again, it's a remnant from\nthe old Unix based operating, I say old,\n\n180\n00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.922\nUnix is still around, but, Don's running\nit on his computer right now as I speak.\n\n181\n00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:39.468\n&gt;&gt; Unix has a long and\nillustrious history.\n\n182\n00:09:39.468 --> 00:09:40.873\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n183\n00:09:40.873 --> 00:09:45.326\nSo cd ..here, that takes you to\nwhatever the parent directory\n\n184\n00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:48.218\nis currently of what you're in, right?\n\n185\n00:09:48.218 --> 00:09:52.098\nAnd we have a file hierarchy, a directory\nhierarchy, in all your file systems,\n\n186\n00:09:52.098 --> 00:09:55.193\ndoesn't matter what operating\nsystem you're in, all right?\n\n187\n00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:59.041\nBut I can also do a cd, and\none of the things that I could do, and\n\n188\n00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.420\nlet me make sure that I put de in there.\n\n189\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.544\nI could do the same thing, right?\n\n190\n00:10:02.544 --> 00:10:05.534\nI could do,\nI don't have to put the dot forward slash.\n\n191\n00:10:05.534 --> 00:10:09.044\n./ and help me out, Dan, cuz I know\nyou're working with scripts a lot, too.\n\n192\n00:10:09.044 --> 00:10:12.524\nA lot of times, they'll put a ./ to make\nsure that scripts can find a location\n\n193\n00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:13.865\nwithin a certain directory?\n\n194\n00:10:13.865 --> 00:10:18.787\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when your scripting, it's very\nimportant to use full file path names or\n\n195\n00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:20.557\nsomething similar to that.\n\n196\n00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:24.397\nBecause if you don't, then hackers can\ncome along if they've gained access to\n\n197\n00:10:24.397 --> 00:10:27.628\nyour system, can use those scripts\nto elevate their privileges.\n\n198\n00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:32.509\nSo it's always a good idea when you're\nscripting to use the actual full path\n\n199\n00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:37.387\nnames, or at least use the dot slash\nif it's in that current directory where\n\n200\n00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.235\nthe binary of the script is.\n\n201\n00:10:39.235 --> 00:10:40.503\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and like we mentioned, but\n\n202\n00:10:40.503 --> 00:10:43.502\nyou don't have to if you're just doing\nbasic navigation inside your terminal.\n\n203\n00:10:43.502 --> 00:10:45.421\n&gt;&gt; If it's in the path,\n\n204\n00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:51.405\nthere's a thing called a path\nenvironmental variable, $PATH.\n\n205\n00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:56.359\nAnd that will give you a list of\ndirectories that it will look into\n\n206\n00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:59.126\nto run any kind of executable file.\n\n207\n00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:01.743\nSo if you create a script,\nit should be executable,\n\n208\n00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.597\nyou set the path to be that\ndirectory that script lies in or\n\n209\n00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:08.222\nyou've created the script in one of\nthose paths that are already there,\n\n210\n00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:11.394\nthen you can just run it from\nthe command line without any help.\n\n211\n00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:12.093\n&gt;&gt; Easy breezy, right?\n\n212\n00:11:12.093 --> 00:11:12.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:16.981\n&gt;&gt; Very good, so keep in mind,\ncd allows you to move inside and\n\n214\n00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:20.756\nthroughout the directory\nhierarchy as you see fit.\n\n215\n00:11:20.756 --> 00:11:26.748\nAnd again, you can do cd\\,\nI think cd\\ works too in this.\n\n216\n00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:27.397\nLet's find out.\n\n217\n00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:29.785\nYeah, it does, but\nit doesn't keep you there for long, right?\n\n218\n00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:33.663\nNow, the other thing that you also want to\nkeep in mind, what if I want to know what\n\n219\n00:11:33.663 --> 00:11:36.995\nis the current directory that I'm\nactually working in at that time?\n\n220\n00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:40.830\nWell, they do call this one out because\nthis one confused the heck out of me, Dan.\n\n221\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.324\nIt's PWD versus PASSWD, right?\n\n222\n00:11:45.324 --> 00:11:47.382\n&gt;&gt; Make sure that I get that right, right?\n\n223\n00:11:47.382 --> 00:11:48.359\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, man,\n\n224\n00:11:48.359 --> 00:11:50.144\nthat confused the heck out of me, right?\n\n225\n00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:53.401\nIf you want to know what's known\nas the present working directory,\n\n226\n00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:55.755\nwhere am I working from,\nI can see that, right?\n\n227\n00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:58.773\nSo that shows me,\nif I believe my home directory right here,\n\n228\n00:11:58.773 --> 00:12:01.744\nthe user profile basically,\nlike we would say in Windows.\n\n229\n00:12:01.744 --> 00:12:08.206\nBut if you're talking about\nsomething like the password command,\n\n230\n00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:14.450\nP-A-S-S-W-D, that actually\nallows you to set passwords.\n\n231\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:22.496\nSo for instance, student 01 is the user\nthat I'm currently logged in as, right?\n\n232\n00:12:22.496 --> 00:12:24.927\nSo if I wanted to,\nI can change my password, right?\n\n233\n00:12:24.927 --> 00:12:31.290\nI believe that if I type passwd, and I\ntype student's, if I could type student's.\n\n234\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:36.441\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:12:36.441 --> 00:12:38.685\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and I hit Enter,\n\n236\n00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:42.946\nit's going to say, okay,\nwhat is the current Unix password?\n\n237\n00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:45.240\nAnd I can type that.\n\n238\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.362\n&gt;&gt; You can type it in.\n\n239\n00:12:46.362 --> 00:12:48.746\n&gt;&gt; And enter the new password.\n\n240\n00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:53.380\nIf I can type the same password twice\nwe will be doing good apparently.\n\n241\n00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:56.374\nThere we go.\n\n242\n00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:57.888\nPassword unchanged?\n\n243\n00:12:57.888 --> 00:12:59.100\nIt's because I don't know how to type.\n\n244\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.046\n[CROSSTALK] Here we go,\nlets try that again.\n\n245\n00:13:05.093 --> 00:13:06.867\nI bet you.\n\n246\n00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:07.899\nLet me try that one more time.\n\n247\n00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:09.628\nYou know what?\nI keep putting a backslash in there.\n\n248\n00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:11.829\nI think that's exactly what it is.\n\n249\n00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:12.859\nI am going to try that one more time.\n\n250\n00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:15.102\nSee, sorry, passwords do not match.\n\n251\n00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:16.930\nAll right, so passwords unchanged.\n\n252\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.429\nLets try that one more time and\neventually-\n\n253\n00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:19.775\n&gt;&gt; Log files to see what an error\n\n254\n00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:20.396\nlooks like.\n\n255\n00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:23.154\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:13:23.154 --> 00:13:24.697\n&gt;&gt; Nothing like your syslog there,\n\n257\n00:13:24.697 --> 00:13:25.916\nright on camera, right?\n\n258\n00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:29.323\nSo let's try that again, so student-\n&gt;&gt; You know what, Wes,\n\n259\n00:13:29.323 --> 00:13:31.390\njust the first thought\noff the top of my head.\n\n260\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.571\nAre you trying to change the password\nto the password it already is?\n\n261\n00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:35.417\n&gt;&gt; Yes I am.\n\n262\n00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:36.912\n&gt;&gt; That might be your issue.\n\n263\n00:13:36.912 --> 00:13:40.002\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting, because in Windows,\nyou're allowed to do that.\n\n264\n00:13:40.002 --> 00:13:40.891\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:41.593\n&gt;&gt; Not here in Linux.\n\n266\n00:13:41.593 --> 00:13:45.809\n&gt;&gt; Linux is saying I'm looking at this\npassword you're saying you want to change,\n\n267\n00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:49.036\nand there's no difference, so\nthere's nothing to change.\n\n268\n00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:50.065\nIt's already that.\n\n269\n00:13:50.065 --> 00:13:52.782\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's try to do that again here.\n\n270\n00:13:52.782 --> 00:13:54.648\nSo again,\nkind of cleared the screen up here.\n\n271\n00:13:54.648 --> 00:13:57.648\nWe'll go ahead and do passwd.\n\n272\n00:13:57.648 --> 00:14:01.441\nJust like Dan said, since it's the user\naccount that I'm already logged in as.\n\n273\n00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:04.659\nAnd now let's see if I can, I might\nnot be able to remember my password.\n\n274\n00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:06.633\nThere we go.\nI can remember my password.\n\n275\n00:14:06.633 --> 00:14:07.527\n&gt;&gt; It can be done.\n\n276\n00:14:07.527 --> 00:14:08.132\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n277\n00:14:08.132 --> 00:14:10.705\n&gt;&gt; And we'll try that again,\nand there we go.\n\n278\n00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:11.404\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n279\n00:14:11.404 --> 00:14:14.123\n&gt;&gt; Very good so, you gotta change,\nactually you got to change the password.\n\n280\n00:14:14.123 --> 00:14:17.775\nAnd that's kind of interesting, cuz like I\nsaid, you can do that in Windows, right?\n\n281\n00:14:17.775 --> 00:14:18.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n282\n00:14:18.287 --> 00:14:21.704\n&gt;&gt; When you do, for instance, you do\npassword resets, and for whatever reason,\n\n283\n00:14:21.704 --> 00:14:25.070\nI've done it before, where I'm just\ngonna keep a generic password anyways.\n\n284\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.118\nI'm gonna reset it back to the same\ngeneric password regardless.\n\n285\n00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.331\nIt's just for demonstration.\n\n286\n00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:32.571\n&gt;&gt; I would think that you would probably\nnot have an issue with it if you were\n\n287\n00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:33.496\nlogged in as roots.\n\n288\n00:14:33.496 --> 00:14:35.497\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; If you on route now,\n\n289\n00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:40.052\nI'm changing student one's password,\nit wouldn't have given you any problems.\n\n290\n00:14:40.052 --> 00:14:43.508\nBut just like in Windows,\nif you have password policies that\n\n291\n00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:48.481\nsay don't reuse passwords, the user would\nnot have been able to reuse that password.\n\n292\n00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:51.518\nThey would have said no, you can't\ndo that, if that policy was enabled.\n\n293\n00:14:51.518 --> 00:14:53.722\nWhere here in Linux it's\nprobably a default thing.\n\n294\n00:14:53.722 --> 00:14:56.764\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kinda interesting\ncuz that actually gives a good segue\n\n295\n00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:57.700\nto the next command.\n\n296\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's move on.\n\n297\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.376\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:04.637\n&gt;&gt; We talked about a little bit about\n\n299\n00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:05.695\nSUDO, right?\n\n300\n00:15:05.695 --> 00:15:06.957\nSuper User Do.\n\n301\n00:15:06.957 --> 00:15:10.422\nKeep in mind that even though\nStduen01 here is an administrator,\n\n302\n00:15:10.422 --> 00:15:12.808\nthose privileges aren't elevated, right?\n\n303\n00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:16.321\nAnd we don't want to log in and\nrun as route.\n\n304\n00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:20.416\nSo what we do is we have that privilege,\nit's escalation, we've got that lowered\n\n305\n00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:24.231\nprivilege, and it's not until you need\nthose privileges that you elevate.\n\n306\n00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:27.708\nBecause we don't want just software\nto have access to the kernel and\n\n307\n00:15:27.708 --> 00:15:31.809\nbe able to make modifications to things\nand really hose things up or even worse.\n\n308\n00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:33.448\n&gt;&gt; Ask Microsoft how that worked out for\nthem [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:35.366\n&gt;&gt; Right, works out great, right?\n\n310\n00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:36.633\nVery good.\n\n311\n00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:37.939\nSo let's go ahead, and let's show you.\n\n312\n00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:42.151\nSo if I want to do something like\nmaybe I wanna do an app get.\n\n313\n00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:45.937\nAnd I don't know,\nI wanna install, well, we'll do,\n\n314\n00:15:45.937 --> 00:15:48.606\nwe kind of mentioned updates, right?\n\n315\n00:15:48.606 --> 00:15:51.140\nSo, apt-get update, right?\n\n316\n00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.858\nAnd I wanna do something like,\nI don't know,\n\n317\n00:15:53.858 --> 00:15:56.521\nlet's see if it'll actually do the update.\n\n318\n00:15:56.521 --> 00:15:57.870\nOkay, so\ndoes it give me permission denied?\n\n319\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:58.565\nYes, it does.\n\n320\n00:15:58.565 --> 00:15:59.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gives permission denied.\n\n321\n00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:01.672\n&gt;&gt; There we go,\nit gives me a permission denied, right?\n\n322\n00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:05.048\nWell, notice that if I want,\nif I'm part of sudoers group,\n\n323\n00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.178\nyou've gotta be part of\nthe super users group, right?\n\n324\n00:16:08.178 --> 00:16:09.340\nIn order for this to work.\n\n325\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.450\nI can run a sudo.\n\n326\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.902\nIn fact, I can just run that command here,\nmake it easier so\n\n327\n00:16:13.902 --> 00:16:16.193\nI can type a little bit easier, right?\n\n328\n00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:18.291\nAnd I add the sudo to it.\n\n329\n00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:22.671\nNow it's gonna ask me for my password, and\nit's gonna elevate those privileges, and\n\n330\n00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:24.655\nit's gonna run that command, right?\n\n331\n00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:25.824\n&gt;&gt; Get a little more action out of it.\n\n332\n00:16:25.824 --> 00:16:27.712\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I can give you a little trick there,\n\n333\n00:16:27.712 --> 00:16:29.090\ncuz I do this all the time.\n\n334\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.940\nI'm horrible about forgetting to use sudo.\n\n335\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.658\nI just run the command and go,\nyeah moron, you're not root.\n\n336\n00:16:34.658 --> 00:16:37.490\n[LAUGH] Time to elevate the privileges.\n\n337\n00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.915\nWhen you do that, do sudo space\nexclamation point exclamation point,\n\n338\n00:16:41.915 --> 00:16:45.766\nand it will run the last command\nwith sudo in front of it.\n\n339\n00:16:45.766 --> 00:16:48.789\n&gt;&gt; That's great, that's a neat little tip.\n&gt;&gt; That's a nice little fast quick trick.\n\n340\n00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:49.937\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I could have used that-\n\n341\n00:16:49.937 --> 00:16:50.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As I was practicing for that one for\n\n342\n00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:52.267\nsure.\n[LAUGH] So again,\n\n343\n00:16:52.267 --> 00:16:55.860\nkeep in mind that elevates your commands.\n\n344\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.670\nWell, there might be a point, and maybe\nyou can give an example where you just\n\n345\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.260\nwanna run a series of commands as root.\n\n346\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.750\nSo you can use SU.\n\n347\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.620\nSU you should be using very\nvery sparingly, I would say.\n\n348\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.264\nBecause you are going to run as root,\nand you could do an SU.\n\n349\n00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.688\nAnd I don't know if we set\nthe password on this one.\n\n350\n00:17:14.688 --> 00:17:15.468\nYeah, they did.\n\n351\n00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:22.048\nAll right, so now you'll notice\nthat if I do an apt-get and\n\n352\n00:17:22.048 --> 00:17:28.113\nI do update, it didn't ask me for\na password, right?\n\n353\n00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:31.035\nAgain, you've gotta be\nsparing with this one, right?\n\n354\n00:17:31.035 --> 00:17:34.066\nWe don't wanna run as root,\nrun it as least as possible.\n\n355\n00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:38.830\nAnd if you are done with it,\njust exit out of it and\n\n356\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.490\nput yourself back into the context\nof whatever the standard user, or\n\n357\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.860\nthe non-root user is,\nthat you are currently working with.\n\n358\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.670\nAll right, so those are a couple of\nthe commands too that we can use.\n\n359\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.220\nSome of the other ones\nthat they call out too.\n\n360\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.040\nThey call out iwconfig ifconfig.\n\n361\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.590\nNow, iwconfig is for\nthe wireless interface, right?\n\n362\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.290\nSo if you wanna check out your\nwireless network adapter settings,\n\n363\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.970\nyou can use iwconfig.\n\n364\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.347\nifconfig, it's kinda like the Windows\nipconfig, but it's a little bit more.\n\n365\n00:18:09.347 --> 00:18:12.768\nipconfig is just internet\nprotocol configuration,\n\n366\n00:18:12.768 --> 00:18:15.893\nwhile ifconfig is at\ninterface configuration.\n\n367\n00:18:15.893 --> 00:18:18.982\nPay attention to the Linux\ndistro you have,\n\n368\n00:18:18.982 --> 00:18:23.171\nbecause a lot of times what\nthey're using today is ip addr.\n\n369\n00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:27.255\nUbuntu does have ifconfig\ninstalled by default.\n\n370\n00:18:27.255 --> 00:18:28.530\nSo let me go ahead and show you here.\n\n371\n00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:35.650\nIf you do an ifconfig, and I run like -a,\nit shows me my IP information, right?\n\n372\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.960\nSo for instance,\nI can see what the broadcast address is,\n\n373\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.200\nI could see what my IP addresses,\nI could see the hardware addr if you will.\n\n374\n00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.830\nThe hardware address,\nthat's my Mac address.\n\n375\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.475\nAnd I can see what the subnet mask is too.\n\n376\n00:18:49.475 --> 00:18:52.050\nNotice there's a lot of\ninformation here too.\n\n377\n00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.465\nMaybe I just wanna know\nwhat the IP address is.\n\n378\n00:18:54.465 --> 00:18:57.041\nMaybe I don't care about what\nthe hardware address is.\n\n379\n00:18:57.041 --> 00:19:00.885\nWell, that's where another command,\nand then swears by this command does,\n\n380\n00:19:00.885 --> 00:19:03.565\nthat you can use what's known\nas a pipe character, and\n\n381\n00:19:03.565 --> 00:19:05.915\nyou could take one command and\npipe the output.\n\n382\n00:19:05.915 --> 00:19:08.615\nSend that output into the next command.\n\n383\n00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.795\nAnd the one of that,\nthat we use a lot is what's known as grip.\n\n384\n00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:16.568\nSo for instance, if I wanted to say,\nyou know what, I don't care about all this\n\n385\n00:19:16.568 --> 00:19:20.718\nother information, what I just wanna\nsee is, what is my IP address.\n\n386\n00:19:20.718 --> 00:19:23.174\nMaybe for the IP address.\n\n387\n00:19:23.174 --> 00:19:26.916\nThen what I could do is, if I put the dash\non the right side of the river there.\n\n388\n00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:27.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:29.348\n&gt;&gt; -a\n&gt;&gt; Hit me.\n\n390\n00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:30.742\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pipe command.\n\n391\n00:19:30.742 --> 00:19:33.220\nAnd I could do |grep here.\n\n392\n00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.200\nAnd I could do something like inet.\n\n393\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.280\nNotice that what it does, is when I use\n|grep, it's telling me, all right, well,\n\n394\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.860\nthis is the information that\nstarts with inet in this case.\n\n395\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.560\nAnd now I can kinda keep some\nof that information right,\n\n396\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.100\nisolate down and get all the information,\njust the information that I want.\n\n397\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.159\nBecause there's a lot of times\nwhen these files that you have,\n\n398\n00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.468\ncuz everything in Linux\nis essentially a file,\n\n399\n00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:58.480\njust understand that now they've\nwrapped a GUI around it.\n\n400\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.480\nIf you're first getting into Ubuntu,\nyou maybe lose that factor.\n\n401\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.001\nThere could be a lot of\ntextual information,\n\n402\n00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.098\nthat you just wanna get to specific line.\n\n403\n00:20:05.098 --> 00:20:09.759\nAnd the grep command is perfect for\nhelping you just isolated down,\n\n404\n00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:12.639\njust those few lines that maybe you want.\n\n405\n00:20:12.639 --> 00:20:14.780\nAll right, so a little bit about grep.\n\n406\n00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.510\nThere are some other things we could use.\n\n407\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.750\nI mentioned DD in the previous episode.\n\n408\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.780\nRemember, that's the data duplicator,\ndisk duplicator.\n\n409\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.593\nWhat you call their name?\n\n410\n00:20:24.593 --> 00:20:25.497\n&gt;&gt;

If you're not careful,\nthat's exactly what it's gonna do.\n\n414\n00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:31.214\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's a very powerful command.\n\n415\n00:20:31.214 --> 00:20:34.117\nAgain, it was originally\nmade to take tapes and\n\n416\n00:20:34.117 --> 00:20:37.900\nconvert that over to disk format,\ndisk format over to tapes.\n\n417\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.510\nBut it does a lot of things,\nit does conversion, if you will.\n\n418\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.880\nCreates bootable images as well,\non things like USB drives too.\n\n419\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.005\nYou also have a basic copy command\nthat's CP, that you can use as well.\n\n420\n00:20:49.005 --> 00:20:52.150\nAnd it's just copying files\nfrom source to destination.\n\n421\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.820\nYou also have mv.\n\n422\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.348\nmv is the move command.\n\n423\n00:20:55.348 --> 00:20:57.135\nAnd again, now,\nyou're not copying it right,\n\n424\n00:20:57.135 --> 00:20:59.106\nyou're just moving it from\none location to the next.\n\n425\n00:20:59.106 --> 00:21:01.381\n&gt;&gt; It's a great way to\nquickly rename a file.\n\n426\n00:21:01.381 --> 00:21:01.941\n&gt;&gt; Very very good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n427\n00:21:01.941 --> 00:21:03.643\njust move it to the same\ndirectory with a different name.\n\n428\n00:21:03.643 --> 00:21:04.412\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n429\n00:21:04.412 --> 00:21:05.503\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, perfect.\n\n430\n00:21:05.503 --> 00:21:12.100\nNow, there might be some times that\nmaybe you want to maybe change or\n\n431\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.171\nmodify the permissions inside of a file.\n\n432\n00:21:16.171 --> 00:21:20.421\nOne of the things that you can use, you\ncan use a chmod, if I can say that right.\n\n433\n00:21:20.421 --> 00:21:21.849\nYour change mode bits, I believe.\n\n434\n00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n435\n00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:27.200\nRight, and essentially that will\nallow you to modify the permissions.\n\n436\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.061\nThere might be a time that\nmaybe you wanna take and\n\n437\n00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:36.061\nchange the user or group ownership,\nover a file or directory.\n\n438\n00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:38.020\nThat's where you're gonna\nuse something like,\n\n439\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.658\ndo you say chown is that how it's called?\n\n440\n00:21:39.658 --> 00:21:41.224\n&gt;&gt; I just say ch own.\n&gt;&gt; ch own, right, and\n\n441\n00:21:41.224 --> 00:21:44.394\nthat's all that does,\nis it changes the ownership too.\n\n442\n00:21:44.394 --> 00:21:47.850\nA lotta cool things that you have too,\nright?\n\n443\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.010\nHere's another one that you have,\n\n444\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.240\nthat is built into most of\nyour Linux operating systems.\n\n445\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.360\nAnd that's something known as Vi.\n\n446\n00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.648\nA simplistic text, I say simplistic-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n447\n00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:59.609\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a simple text editor as far as\n\n448\n00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:04.783\nprocessing power goes, but it's certainly\nnot simplistic when it comes to using it.\n\n449\n00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:06.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n450\n00:22:06.223 --> 00:22:09.810\nit definitely has its own\nlanguage that you have to learn.\n\n451\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.960\nSo let me go ahead and show you here.\n\n452\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.512\nLet me clear the screen here real quick.\n\n453\n00:22:14.512 --> 00:22:18.790\nAnd let me see, I don't know if\nI have any, I'll tell you what,\n\n454\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.767\nlet me go ahead and just do touch,\nand we'll do demo.txt.\n\n455\n00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:25.500\n&gt;&gt; You can also just\ncreate it with the vi.\n\n456\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.294\nSo just say vi demo.txt,\nand it'll create that.\n\n457\n00:22:28.294 --> 00:22:29.133\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect, perfect.\n\n458\n00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:32.599\nSee, again perfect reason to have\na Linux scout here on the show with me.\n\n459\n00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:33.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:22:33.617 --> 00:22:34.889\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so again,\n\n461\n00:22:34.889 --> 00:22:36.230\nnow we use our ls command.\n\n462\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.659\nYou could see that I've\ncreated a little file here.\n\n463\n00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:41.994\nAnd if I do a vi and we do demo.txt,\n\n464\n00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:47.634\nyou can see that we can get\ninto the Vi text editor, right?\n\n465\n00:22:47.634 --> 00:22:52.295\nAnd this gives us the ability to,\nif we want,\n\n466\n00:22:52.295 --> 00:22:56.120\nwe can say, right, this is my file.\n\n467\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.255\nRight, and essentially, if you know\nthe lingo, which it has it's own lingo\n\n468\n00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:06.397\nthat you really really gotta watch,\nhere you can essentially save the file.\n\n469\n00:23:06.397 --> 00:23:11.640\nAnd if you want, you can see the text\nwithin that file with the cat command.\n\n470\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.185\nYou could see that I can\nread the file as well.\n\n471\n00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:15.690\nSo, Vi, again, very basic.\n\n472\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.292\nAgain, basic is in CPU resources\n[LAUGH] and memory resources.\n\n473\n00:23:19.292 --> 00:23:22.670\nIt's pretty much in all the Linux distros,\nso you've got to make modifications.\n\n474\n00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.013\nAnd you don't know if there's a file or\n\n475\n00:23:25.013 --> 00:23:29.703\na text editor inside of the operating\nsystem, you at least have access to one.\n\n476\n00:23:29.703 --> 00:23:34.507\nDan is not joking around, I'm certainly\nnot joking around when it comes to using\n\n477\n00:23:34.507 --> 00:23:36.921\nthis, you really have to get used to it.\n\n478\n00:23:36.921 --> 00:23:40.002\n&gt;&gt; Yes, think of all the favorite things\nyou love about your graphical text\n\n479\n00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:42.342\neditors, and\nput that into a command line in some way.\n\n480\n00:23:42.342 --> 00:23:44.734\nSo you have to use a lot\nof key combinations,\n\n481\n00:23:44.734 --> 00:23:49.560\nto make things do stuff you're used\nto doing in a graphical environment.\n\n482\n00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.409\nThat's where they took it from.\n\n483\n00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:54.572\nIt's all these old text editors Well,\nthere's big buttons for that now,\n\n484\n00:23:54.572 --> 00:23:56.821\nwhere back in the day, it was keystrokes.\n\n485\n00:23:56.821 --> 00:24:00.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, in fact, let me,\nI'll tell you what, [LAUGH].\n\n486\n00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:02.684\nLet me show you what I learned too.\n\n487\n00:24:02.684 --> 00:24:07.213\nBecause right, so since I'm using\nvirtualization, I started hitting things,\n\n488\n00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:10.705\nI went into the insert mode, and\nI started hitting the arrows.\n\n489\n00:24:10.705 --> 00:24:12.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yeah that wasn't working.\n\n490\n00:24:12.756 --> 00:24:13.685\n&gt;&gt; It looks great.\n\n491\n00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:16.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit worked absolutely wonderful.\n\n492\n00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:21.639\nSo again, just keep in mind, oops,\nand make sure that I do that right.\n\n493\n00:24:21.639 --> 00:24:27.773\nJust keep in mind that you, oops,\nI'm gonna try that again here.\n\n494\n00:24:27.773 --> 00:24:31.082\nAnd I'm gonna quit,\nI don't wanna write anything, there we go.\n\n495\n00:24:31.082 --> 00:24:35.390\nBut again, keep in mind that [LAUGH] you\ndon't have access to even sometimes,\n\n496\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.791\neven things like your arrow keys, right?\n\n497\n00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:41.633\nSo you'll have to know textual,\n\n498\n00:24:41.633 --> 00:24:46.717\nhow to move around and\nmanipulate the text.\n\n499\n00:24:46.717 --> 00:24:50.693\nThere is, one of our other hosts\ngave me a good piece of advice,\n\n500\n00:24:50.693 --> 00:24:54.385\nmaybe I'll give it to you guys\nif you ever wanna look at vi.\n\n501\n00:24:54.385 --> 00:24:58.277\nvi is now, I think now called vim,\nit's vi improved, if you will.\n\n502\n00:24:58.277 --> 00:25:02.579\nAnd there's actually a website out there,\nI think called Vim Adventure.\n\n503\n00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:05.142\nAnd you play the whole entire\nvideo game through vi,\n\n504\n00:25:05.142 --> 00:25:07.949\nand you have to use vi in order\nto be able to manipulate it.\n\n505\n00:25:07.949 --> 00:25:11.108\nSo it kinda gets you used to it,\nin a fun fashion if you wanna use it.\n\n506\n00:25:11.108 --> 00:25:14.129\nAgain, I don't think they're\ngonna ask you how to use vi.\n\n507\n00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:17.678\nThey're just gonna want to know,\nat the A+ level,\n\n508\n00:25:17.678 --> 00:25:20.824\nwhat you would use if you\nonly have a terminal or\n\n509\n00:25:20.824 --> 00:25:26.166\na shell to do textual manipulation, or\njust to create files and change texts.\n\n510\n00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:29.204\nAll right, a couple more that\nwe gotta talk about, well,\n\n511\n00:25:29.204 --> 00:25:32.432\nhow about removing a file, or\nremoving a directory, right?\n\n512\n00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:34.351\nWell, that's where the rm\ncommand comes in too.\n\n513\n00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:38.712\nSo for instance, if I do an ls,\nremember that I do have that demo.txt.\n\n514\n00:25:38.712 --> 00:25:43.454\nWell, I can always do a rm demo.txt,\nand if I run the ls command,\n\n515\n00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:45.448\nnotice it is gone, right?\n\n516\n00:25:45.448 --> 00:25:50.660\nSo rm remove is another command there too,\nthat you need to know about.\n\n517\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.483\n&gt;&gt; If you are, a helpful little\nhint as well goes on there,\n\n518\n00:25:53.483 --> 00:25:57.405\ntrying to remove a directory and\nit's got files there, even if it doesn't.\n\n519\n00:25:57.405 --> 00:26:00.420\nIt hates removing directories\njust based off of principle.\n\n520\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.708\nIt's like, no no no,\nyou might have something in there,\n\n521\n00:26:02.708 --> 00:26:04.075\nyou wanna check that out, right?\n\n522\n00:26:04.075 --> 00:26:07.815\nThat's nice, it's gonna make sure there's\nnothing in there that you don't wanna\n\n523\n00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:10.196\ndelete, but\nif you need to remove a directory rm -r.\n\n524\n00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:10.725\n&gt;&gt; The force options.\n\n525\n00:26:10.725 --> 00:26:13.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not saying force,\nit's saying recursive.\n\n526\n00:26:13.194 --> 00:26:15.714\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Recursively remove everything inside of\n\n527\n00:26:15.714 --> 00:26:18.650\nthat directory, and\nthen remove the directory.\n\n528\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.369\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n529\n00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:21.764\n&gt;&gt; That's a very nice good little fail\nsafe, well we're not gonna say fail safe,\n\n530\n00:26:21.764 --> 00:26:22.427\na little safety net.\n\n531\n00:26:22.427 --> 00:26:24.339\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I guess the last command that we just\n\n532\n00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:26.387\ngot, I kind of gotta mention here too,\n\n533\n00:26:26.387 --> 00:26:29.800\nkind of looking through the list\nhere is the ps command.\n\n534\n00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:35.035\nAll right, you noticed that, for instance\nin the Mac operating system, Mac OS.\n\n535\n00:26:35.035 --> 00:26:36.535\nI launched Task Manager,\n\n536\n00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:40.292\nand that would show me things\nlike our active processes, right?\n\n537\n00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:44.069\nWell, you can also see that inside\nof a text, inside of a command,\n\n538\n00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:46.710\nI'm gonna say a command\nprompt to everybody.\n\n539\n00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Terminal, or a shell,\n\n540\n00:26:49.031 --> 00:26:54.013\njust by using the ps command,\nand if you do a ps -A, remember,\n\n541\n00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:58.250\nthe capital, uppercase,\nlowercase matters here.\n\n542\n00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.633\nI could see all the active processes\nthat are working, or running right now,\n\n543\n00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:04.533\ninside of the operating system.\n\n544\n00:27:04.533 --> 00:27:09.045\nSo just a few different little,\na few of the commands that you have to,\n\n545\n00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:10.742\nI would know for the exam.\n\n546\n00:27:10.742 --> 00:27:16.020\nYou don't have to know the ins and outs of\neach one, just kind of know what they do.\n\n547\n00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.513\nSo that if they give you a scenario\non the exam and they say, hey,\n\n548\n00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:22.899\nyou need to edit this file inside\nof a Linux operating system.\n\n549\n00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:26.182\nWhich of these, through the terminal,\nwill allow you to do that and\n\n550\n00:27:26.182 --> 00:27:27.580\nknow that it's vi, right?\n\n551\n00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:32.021\nYou need to view all the processes that\nare running on an Ubuntu operating system\n\n552\n00:27:32.021 --> 00:27:35.743\nand you only have a terminal,\nwhich one of these are you gonna use?\n\n553\n00:27:35.743 --> 00:27:37.630\nI really think that you'll be doing good.\n\n554\n00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.733\nLast but not least,\nyou have the shutdown option.\n\n555\n00:27:40.733 --> 00:27:43.470\nYou can always shut down a machine here.\n\n556\n00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.699\nYou could restart a machine.\n\n557\n00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:47.600\nKeep in mind that I saved this one for\nlast.\n\n558\n00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because we'll go ahead and\n\n559\n00:27:49.493 --> 00:27:50.340\nshut it down.\n\n560\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.080\n&gt;&gt; Please shut the machine down.\n[LAUGH]\n\n561\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.352\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna shut the machine down and\n\n562\n00:27:52.352 --> 00:27:53.470\nyou can see exactly what it does.\n\n563\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.045\nIt'll perform a graceful\nshutdown of the machine.\n\n564\n00:27:55.045 --> 00:27:55.970\nSo, that's it.\n\n565\n00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:00.298\nThat's essentially some of the things\nthat you need to know when it comes to\n\n566\n00:28:00.298 --> 00:28:03.745\nthe other technologies\ninside of the A+ 22902 exam.\n\n567\n00:28:03.745 --> 00:28:05.545\nAnd I think we've covered it all.\n\n568\n00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:08.909\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, it was definitely\na long list of things for us to know.\n\n569\n00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:11.626\nBecause well, hey, you know what,\nif you're gonna mess around as\n\n570\n00:28:11.626 --> 00:28:14.819\nan IT technician, well, you've gotta\nbecome familiar at least, somewhat,\n\n571\n00:28:14.819 --> 00:28:17.267\nwith the other technologies\nthat might come along your way.\n\n572\n00:28:17.267 --> 00:28:20.736\nSo that being said, Wes, you did a great\njob with showing us what those might be,\n\n573\n00:28:20.736 --> 00:28:21.922\nand how we could use those.\n\n574\n00:28:21.922 --> 00:28:24.030\nGo out there and practice and\nplay, and have a good time.\n\n575\n00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.800\nAs for this episode though, we are out\nof time, we do thank you for watching.\n\n576\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.426\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n577\n00:28:30.426 --> 00:28:30.992\n&gt;&gt;

great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:20.767\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, well, we're back in action,\n\n7\n00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:24.960\nback in the

00:00:34.530\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.901\nThanks for putting some Steven Tyler and\nsome classic Aerosmith in my head,\n\n13\n00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:38.803\nback in the saddle.\n\n14\n00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:42.737\nBut that is right, like Dan says,\nwe are moving along in our 220-902C,\n\n15\n00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:46.671\nhe does better with the exam codes than I\ndo and I've been teaching it for seven,\n\n16\n00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.397\neight years.\n\n17\n00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:48.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n18\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.990\nSo we're gonna be looking at a 1concept\nthat you should be familiar with and\n\n19\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.980\nI gotta say ladies and\ngentlemen out there,\n\n20\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.190\nthis is probably my second favorite\ntopic when it comes to the 902 series.\n\n21\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.433\nMy first favorite topic is,\nDan's already mentioned is networking,\n\n22\n00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.629\nwe both love networking.\n\n23\n00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.590\nSo I love the networking side of things,\nbut\n\n24\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.840\nthis really has to be my\nsecond favorite topic.\n\n25\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.100\nBecause well, it's really what let's us\ndo some of the things that we've been\n\n26\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.500\nshowing you through.\n\n27\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.615\nReally the A+ series, the net plus series,\nsecurity plus as well, and\n\n28\n00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.230\nthat's something known as virtualization.\n\n29\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.849\nNow, we're gonna talk\nabout in this episode,\n\n30\n00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.170\nwe're gonna talk about one\nside of the tracks, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.418\nSo let me show you, or\njust explain what I mean, all right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:32.540\nYou have two sides of the tracks.\n\n33\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.680\nYou have what's known as\nclient-side virtualization and\n\n34\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.020\nyou have what's known as\nserver-side virtualization.\n\n35\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.380\nNow, both of them are beneficial,\nboth of them have their pros.\n\n36\n00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.500\nAnd well, I guess one of them\nreally doesn't have a con to it.\n\n37\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.870\nBut one does have a pro and a con to it.\n\n38\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.910\nAnd the other one, we have to kinda keep\nin mind that while it doesn't really have\n\n39\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.280\na con to it, it's, I guess,\nexpense might be a con.\n\n40\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.530\nSo let me tell you what I mean, all right?\n\n41\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.144\nWhat you find inside of corporate\nenvironments today, all right?\n\n42\n00:01:57.144 --> 00:02:00.310\nYou find what's known as\nserver-side virtualization.\n\n43\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.450\nYou have a pretty powerful computer\nsitting there right in the server closet.\n\n44\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.510\nOr a cluster of powerful computers\nwhich means they're all kind of\n\n45\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.850\nin tandem together.\n\n46\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.390\nAnd they become what are known as server\nclusters or even farther than that,\n\n47\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.490\nclusters of clusters,\nwhich become server farms, right?\n\n48\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.070\nThey have a lot of resources,\na lot of CPU power, multiple CPU's,\n\n49\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.305\neven tens, up to hundreds of CPU's,\nso that same thing with RAM,\n\n50\n00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:29.660\ntens to hundreds of gigs\nof random access memory.\n\n51\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.767\nNow, when we talk about server-side\nvirtualization, this is what you\n\n52\n00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:40.125\nfind inside of your corporate environments\nbecause it's what we utilize to\n\n53\n00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:46.426\nessentially run our corporate environments\neven in our data centers today, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:51.697\nThe benefit here is you get better\nperformance when you have a server\n\n55\n00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:56.521\nthat is operating and\nrunning the virtualization platform.\n\n56\n00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.736\nAnd I'll break that down\nhere in just a second.\n\n57\n00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:02.120\nThey're not really gonna want you\nto know too much about that at\n\n58\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.800\nthe A+ level on the exam.\n\n59\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.670\nThey're gonna want you to\nknow some of the concepts.\n\n60\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.780\nOne of the great things about it is\nthe concepts, they transcend which side\n\n61\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.360\nof the tracks you're talking about,\nwhen you're talking about virtualization.\n\n62\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.804\n&gt;&gt; And that's a good thing too because\nthere are a few heavy hitters when it\n\n63\n00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:18.923\ncomes to virtualization that\nyou're probably gonna run into.\n\n64\n00:03:18.923 --> 00:03:23.965\nAnd CompTIA wanted to be vendor neutral\nand good thing that they do because\n\n65\n00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:29.246\nif they wanted you to know Citrix,\nthey wanted you to know ESX, from VMware,\n\n66\n00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:34.230\nor any of their other that are out there,\nHyper-V from Microsoft.\n\n67\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.860\nThose would be classes\nall into themselves,\n\n68\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.040\nit would just be impossible for\nyou to cover the nuances of those.\n\n69\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.700\nWell, now we just want\nyou to know the general\n\n70\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.260\nideas behind how we get virtualization\ninside of our environments.\n\n71\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n72\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.180\nAnd Dan, I know you and\nI have both hosted for\n\n73\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.910\nsome of the subject matter\nexperts that have come in here.\n\n74\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.440\nAnd even our internal\nsubject matter expert, Mr.\n\n75\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.760\nDon Pezet, who knows just an extensive\n\n76\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.618\namount of knowledge on virtualization\nthat you're absolutely right.\n\n77\n00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:04.680\nIf we wanted to focus\non one specific vendor,\n\n78\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.190\nwe could be here for quite a few weeks\non just that vendor alone, right?\n\n79\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.701\nWell, that's what you're gonna find\ninside of the corporate environment.\n\n80\n00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:11.630\nWell, guess what?\n\n81\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.032\nYou're also gonna find many different\nvendors on the client-side as well.\n\n82\n00:04:16.032 --> 00:04:19.430\nBut client-side also has its benefits,\nbut it also has its drawbacks, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.230\nNow, I want you to think about this, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.610\nYou have a fairly limited\namount of resources.\n\n85\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.830\nAnd when I say resources,\nunderstand what we're talking about.\n\n86\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.340\nWe're talking about CPU strength,\nyour random access memory, or\n\n87\n00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.020\nyour RAM if you will, generally a little\nlimited amounts of storage if you will.\n\n88\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.090\nAnd that's why client-side is\ntypically something you find in\n\n89\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.283\ntwo basic environments, right?\n\n90\n00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.631\nYou find it in you lab environments,\ntest environments, test bed,\n\n91\n00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:48.550\ntest bed software, right?\n\n92\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.701\nYou can find it basically for\nnon production environments,\n\n93\n00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.060\ntesting in non-production environments.\n\n94\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.570\nAnd again, that's because if\nyou look at my laptop and\n\n95\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.920\nwhen I say my laptop not\nnecessarily the screen, but\n\n96\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.880\njust in general if you're thinking outside\nof the box if I take my laptop here.\n\n97\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.190\nThis laptop has one CPU,\nI mean it's a good CPU,\n\n98\n00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.180\nit's an Intel i5 I think it is, or\nit might be an i7 but I think it's an i5.\n\n99\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.310\nAnd it's a quad core CPU,\nright, so it's a decent CPU.\n\n100\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.634\nI mean Intel makes some of the best CPUs,\nif some will argue,\n\n101\n00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:21.140\nthe best CPUs in the world.\n\n102\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.610\nSo there's nothing wrong with the CPU.\n\n103\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.400\nIt has 16 gigs of random access memory.\n\n104\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.348\nIt's DDR3, so\nit's very good quality memory, right?\n\n105\n00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:31.900\nBut that's not the same thing as a server,\n\n106\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.850\nwhich a server could have 16 CPUs that\nare all quad-core, octa-core, and\n\n107\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.100\neven beyond that, 16 core today,\nand 128 gigs of RAM.\n\n108\n00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.620\nSo the amount that we could\ndo with a server is a lot\n\n109\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.730\ngreater than what we can\ndo here on the client-side.\n\n110\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.440\nBut here on the A+,\nwhat we want to focus on is what\n\n111\n00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.740\ncan we do with your clients when\nit comes to virtualization.\n\n112\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.775\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlet's do that transcend, right?\n\n113\n00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:58.178\nLet's transcend whether we're\ntalking about client-side,\n\n114\n00:05:58.178 --> 00:06:02.212\nwhether we're talking about server-side,\nproduction environments and\n\n115\n00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:04.820\nlet's talk about virtualization,\nall right?\n\n116\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.570\nSo what are some of the benefits\nof virtualization, all right?\n\n117\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.278\nWell, we can run what are known\nas virtual machines, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:13.365\nAnd we talk about virtual machines,\n\n119\n00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:17.474\nthe purpose of a virtual machine is\nthe fact that through virtualization\n\n120\n00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:22.070\nI can run more than one operating system\non a single physical device, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.034\nNow we talk about in other episodes in\n902, we talk about the Linux operating\n\n122\n00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:28.950\nsystem and really Unix based\nsystems in general, right?\n\n123\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.890\nRemember one of the benefits, there are\na lot of benefits to Nix based systems.\n\n124\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.543\nAnd I say Nix as in just combining of the\nother Unix Linux is the fact that you can\n\n125\n00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:42.281\nhave more than one person actively working\nwith a physical piece of hardware.\n\n126\n00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:44.887\nAnd that might be foreign to you if you're\ncoming from the Windows environment and\n\n127\n00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:46.370\nsay, well, wait a second,\nwhat do you mean?\n\n128\n00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.050\nWell, I can have a hundred people that\nhave user accounts on a Windows machine.\n\n129\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.390\nWell, yes, you can but only one of\nthem can be logged in at a time.\n\n130\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.720\nUnix and\nLinux doesn't have that problem, right?\n\n131\n00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.914\nI can have Dan logged into a Unix box,\nI can log into a Unix box,\n\n132\n00:07:00.914 --> 00:07:06.567\nwe can run simultaneous instances within\nour own user sessions that are completely\n\n133\n00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:11.034\nseparate so we have multiple people\non a single physical device.\n\n134\n00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:13.260\nSo how does that compare\nback to virtualization?\n\n135\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.760\nWell, I want you to take that concept and\nI want you kind of flip it around and\n\n136\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.100\nthe fact that what we can have is\none physical device with multiple\n\n137\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.500\noperating systems each\nwith their own resources\n\n138\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.950\nrunning on a single physical machine,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.470\nSo that same type of concept, right,\nwhere you have multiple users but\n\n140\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.892\nthink of that as each isolated\ninstance of an operating system.\n\n141\n00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:36.032\nAnd that's one of the benefits\nof running a virtual machine.\n\n142\n00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:37.878\nNow what is a virtual machine, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:41.462\nWell, a virtual machine is\nnothing more then a logical,\n\n144\n00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:45.560\nsoftware-based if you will,\nphysical device.\n\n145\n00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.780\nThat got tricky, right?\n\n146\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.615\nWell, we got the physical device, right?\n\n147\n00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:51.942\nI can pick up my laptop and\nhand it to Dan,\n\n148\n00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:56.404\nthat's that physical device that Dan\ncan turn around and work with, right?\n\n149\n00:07:56.404 --> 00:07:59.727\nBut a virtual machine is actually\nnothing more than a file.\n\n150\n00:07:59.727 --> 00:08:01.654\nBut what's great about\na virtual machine and\n\n151\n00:08:01.654 --> 00:08:04.810\nvirtualization is there's something\nknown as a hypervisor, right?\n\n152\n00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.130\nKind of like a middle man or a middle\nperson, if you will, that allows this\n\n153\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:17.230\nsoftware based folder or file to encompass\nall of the physical hardware that we see.\n\n154\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.050\nAnd allow it to interact\nwith physical hardware.\n\n155\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.800\nAnd it has no idea, the operating system\nthat's running on it has no idea that hey,\n\n156\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.770\nyou're just a little file\nthat's out there, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.540\nIt thinks that it's a physical machine.\n\n158\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.930\nIt has access through the Hypervisor\nto work with the physical devices.\n\n159\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.810\nAnd the Hypervisor actually kind\nof kind of like a traffic cop.\n\n160\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.300\nSays, okay, you can access the CPU,\nbut hey, you know what.\n\n161\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.390\nYou operating system number two,\nyou can access the hardware now too.\n\n162\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.870\nHey, you operating system four,\nfive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\n163\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.390\nAll these different operating systems\ncan access the hardware at one time.\n\n164\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.630\nThat's a great thing, right?\n\n165\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.940\nSo the purpose of a virtual\nmachine is the fact that\n\n166\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.180\nI can have an isolated instance\nof an operating system.\n\n167\n00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.591\nAnd when I say isolated instance of\nan operating system it's because with\n\n168\n00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:08.200\nclient side virtualization\nyou have to understand,\n\n169\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.900\nthere is kind of these abstract layers.\n\n170\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.700\nLet's go ahead and let's look at our,\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n171\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.830\nLet's see if we can give you something\na little bit more tangible to\n\n172\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.070\nkinda look this up.\n\n173\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.690\nNow, my head's kind covering\nthis one up here, but\n\n174\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.530\nhere's a non-virtualized environment,\nall right?\n\n175\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.840\nAnd if we look at just\nthe abstract layers of computing,\n\n176\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.700\nnotice down here you have your hardware.\n\n177\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.600\nAnd I'm talking about physical devices,\nright?\n\n178\n00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.480\nI have my hardware down here.\n\n179\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.060\nBut then I install an operating system\nlike we've shown you in the 902 series how\n\n180\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.140\nto install Windows, right on the hardware.\n\n181\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.420\nBut when I do non-virtualized environment,\nI get that single\n\n182\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.210\noperating system if you will that is\nrunning and controlling the hardware.\n\n183\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.310\nAnd then what do I do within\nthat operating system?\n\n184\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.360\nI install my different applications.\n\n185\n00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.870\nAll right, now when I install my different\napplications they then communicate to\n\n186\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.620\nthe operating system, and the operating\nsystem allows us to control our hardware.\n\n187\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.840\nWell with a virtualized environment\nthings change a little bit,\n\n188\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.140\nwhat we do is add and extra abstract\nlayer called the hypervisor here.\n\n189\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.540\nAnd what they hypervisor\ndoes is the hypervisor now\n\n190\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:20.390\nacts like the communication point that\nearlier, one operating system was doing.\n\n191\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.220\nAnd what the hypervisor does is it\nallows me to install, guess what?\n\n192\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.940\nOn top of it, multiple operating systems.\n\n193\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.110\nSo I just gave an example,\nif you will, of Server 2012.\n\n194\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.670\nAnd you could you pick your\noperating system, honestly.\n\n195\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.970\nLinux supports this, Mac supports this.\n\n196\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.780\nMac, you have to have their hardware,\nbut still Mac supports this.\n\n197\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.610\nIn fact, we're running Macs right now,\nall right.\n\n198\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.470\nSo you can pick your operating system and\nI can install it on top of the hypervisor\n\n199\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.750\nand then the hypervisor allows us\nto communicate with the hardware.\n\n200\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.370\nSo, again, you're adding an extra layer,\nall right?\n\n201\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.790\nNow, another purpose of the virtual\nmachine is that I can install these\n\n202\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.850\napplications in one operating system,\nand guess what?\n\n203\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.260\nIt doesn't interfere with\nthe other operating system, and\n\n204\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.280\nthat's one of the great things,\nwhen we talk about the isolation.\n\n205\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes,\nI notice a lot of people get confused,\n\n206\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.540\nbecause apparently there is a type one\nhypervisor, and then there's a type\n\n207\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.760\ntwo hypervisor and it gets a little\nconfusing to a lot of people.\n\n208\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.690\nWhat is the distinction between the two?\n\n209\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.140\nBecause they seem to be\ndoing the same thing.\n\n210\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.230\n&gt;&gt; That is a great, great question.\n\n211\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.310\nAnd one of the reasons I say that is\nbecause this is where we talk about\n\n212\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.250\nthe server side virtualization versus\nthe client side virtualization.\n\n213\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.530\nSo you say, well, wait a second, Wes.\n\n214\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.450\nThen which one are you showing us here?\n\n215\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.010\nThis is what's known as\nthe type one hypervisor.\n\n216\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.020\nThis is what you would see\nin a production environment.\n\n217\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.127\nWell wait a second Wes [LAUGH] you said we\nneed to know about client side hypervisor,\n\n218\n00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:46.431\nclient side virtualization, aha.\n\n219\n00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:48.061\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n&gt;&gt; Now we've got client side\n\n220\n00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:49.069\nvirtualization.\n\n221\n00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:51.369\n&gt;&gt; He removes the veil that we might see.\n\n222\n00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:52.207\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n223\n00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:54.628\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; We've been doing this awhile so\n\n224\n00:11:54.628 --> 00:11:56.580\nhe had his old Johnny Carson.\n\n225\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n226\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.364\n&gt;&gt; Part right there.\n\n227\n00:11:58.364 --> 00:11:59.315\n[CROSSTALK] Google that.\n\n228\n00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:02.200\nSome of you guys don't even know\nwho Johnny Carson is anymore.\n\n229\n00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.730\nBut.\n\n230\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.022\n&gt;&gt; I feel old now thank you Wes.\n\n231\n00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.487\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right we just aged Dan for sure.\n\n232\n00:12:06.487 --> 00:12:07.792\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what is the.\n\n233\n00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:11.150\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is the type two hypervisor?\n\n234\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.860\nThat's the client side virtualization.\n\n235\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.360\nCuz kind of what happens here and\n\n236\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.720\nnot to get too confusing is we still\nhave our host operating system.\n\n237\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.680\nJust like we did in our\nnon-virtualized environment, right?\n\n238\n00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.460\nWe still have our operating system.\n\n239\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.620\nI've kind of color coded this\na little bit different so\n\n240\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.798\nwe can see what's going on here.\n\n241\n00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:33.200\nBecause your hypervisor that you\ninstall on client side virtualization,\n\n242\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.550\nit actually runs shoulder to\nshoulder with all your applications.\n\n243\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.990\nIt's just like another piece of\nsoftware that's running side by side.\n\n244\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:46.750\nNow, its functionality is very close,\nbut understand that the hypervisor,\n\n245\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.840\nlike an application on client side, it's\ntalking directly to the operating system.\n\n246\n00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.960\nBut it still gives you the ability\nto run multiple operating systems.\n\n247\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.370\nYou just need what's known as\na host operating system, all right?\n\n248\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.470\nAnd the hypervisor allows the guest\n\n249\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.500\noperating system which is running\nin the virtual machine, right.\n\n250\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.570\nThe software based physical device if\nyou will, the software based hardware.\n\n251\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.260\nIt communicates with the hypervisor\nwhich then in turn communicates with\n\n252\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.940\nthe operating system which then in\nturn communicates with the hardware.\n\n253\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.160\nAnd that's why we say client side\nvirtualization doesn't give you quite\n\n254\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.260\nthe level of performance that\nthis model would, right?\n\n255\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.810\nBecause this model, your operating systems\nare talking right to the hypervisor,\n\n256\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.700\nthe hypervisor goes right\nstraight to the hardware, right?\n\n257\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.760\nSo you get less of that multiple\nlayers of communication, right?\n\n258\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.780\nYour operating system in\nclient-side virtualization,\n\n259\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.080\nit's still performing all\nthe same functionality.\n\n260\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.760\nNow, let's take virtualization and\nthrow it completely out and\n\n261\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.758\ngo back to our non-virtualized\nenvironment, right?\n\n262\n00:13:50.758 --> 00:13:52.840\nIn our non-virtualized environment,\n\n263\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.320\nan application communicates\nwith the operating system.\n\n264\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.170\nThe operating system's got some of\nthe services running in the background,\n\n265\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:58.980\nthat we talked about.\n\n266\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.540\nSo a lot's going on.\n\n267\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.380\nWell, that really doesn't change with\nclient-side virtualization at all.\n\n268\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.850\nYou're hypervisor's just\nlike another application.\n\n269\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.870\nSo it's not only gonna\nmanage the hypervisor,\n\n270\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.472\nthe host operating system does.\n\n271\n00:14:11.472 --> 00:14:15.430\nIt's gotta manage the hypervisor,\nthe hypervisor manages the guest operating\n\n272\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.190\nsystem, which is the virtualized\nside of things, but\n\n273\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.680\nthe host operating system still has to\nmanage all of the applications, all right.\n\n274\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.570\nSo what are some of\nthe additional purposes?\n\n275\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.160\nNow, we're gonna call\non virtual machines but\n\n276\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.300\nunderstand virtual machines run\nvirtualized operating systems.\n\n277\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.090\nDo not let that confuse you, right.\n\n278\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.750\nIt's the whole package, right.\n\n279\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.800\nA virtual machine is a software-based\nrepresentation of physical hardware and\n\n280\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.180\nagain the reason it can run that\nis cuz the hypervisors allowing\n\n281\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.520\nthe communication.\n\n282\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.230\nAll right, so\nwhat are some of the other purposes?\n\n283\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.900\nI want you to think about\nallocating your resources.\n\n284\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.700\nBetter allocation of the resources, right?\n\n285\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.120\nIf I think about my laptop here as\nhaving 16 gigs if I was just to run\n\n286\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.550\na single operating system one operating\nsystem has access to 16 gigs.\n\n287\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.830\nNow there are some programs\nthat we run around here and\n\n288\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.240\nI know you've been working on\nthe back end like Linux stuff and\n\n289\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.460\nprogramming so there are times when\nwe're using a lot of that ram.\n\n290\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.780\nSo don't get me wrong but the majority of\n\n291\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.620\nthe time the majority of that ram is\nsitting silent, not being fully utilized.\n\n292\n00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.250\nThe processors that we have in here and\nlike I said there are always exceptions to\n\n293\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.720\nthe rules, there are some things that\nwe do that are very CPU intensive.\n\n294\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.340\nBut for the most part a lot of those cores\nare just sitting there doing nothing.\n\n295\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.640\nBut imagine the ability to say,\nokay, you know what,\n\n296\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.400\nwhen it comes to the resource\nrequirements, we're gonna go ahead,\n\n297\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.280\nwe're gonna give this machine\nthrough allocation two gigs of ram.\n\n298\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.800\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n299\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.620\nRather than just talk about it let me\njust show you here on the Mac, right,\n\n300\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.140\nthat I have.\n\n301\n00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.840\nI'm running a client side hypervisor,\n\n302\n00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.800\na virtualization software\ncalled VMware Fusion.\n\n303\n00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.696\nAnd you can see that I have\nthese virtual machines here.\n\n304\n00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:57.466\nAll right now, if I, and these\nare the virtual machines, honestly Dan,\n\n305\n00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:59.312\nthat we've been using\nthroughout this series.\n\n306\n00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:03.108\nAnd so, I mean, this is, you're seeing\nwhat Has been running in the background,\n\n307\n00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:03.661\nall right.\n\n308\n00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:08.524\nSo if I go to the settings here I have to\nallocate resources including things like\n\n309\n00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:13.391\ndisplay resources, processor and memory,\nkeyboard and mouse, you can see,\n\n310\n00:16:13.391 --> 00:16:15.519\nnetwork adapters and hard drive.\n\n311\n00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:19.700\nNow these hard drives are logical, they\nare really nothing more than a folder.\n\n312\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.640\nBut a virtual disk, or\na virtual hard drive,\n\n313\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.910\ndepending on what platform you're looking\nat, they'll call it different things.\n\n314\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.560\nAll comes down to a file that\nencompasses all of the normal\n\n315\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.230\nactions of a traditional physical drive.\n\n316\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.530\n&gt;&gt; And this is the type two hypervisor\nbecause this is the software that's\n\n317\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.390\nrunning on your operating system.\n\n318\n00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.290\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n319\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.440\nIf I get out of this right here and\nkind of, switch back and, kind of,\n\n320\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.570\nminimize this,\nI'm running this right here on my map.\n\n321\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.140\nAbsolutely, thank you for\nyour clarification on that, too.\n\n322\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.220\nAll right, now if I look, some of\nthe resource requirements I can do, right,\n\n323\n00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.350\nthis is a quad-core processor.\n\n324\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.770\nAll right, and because it is a quad core\nprocessor, I have the ability through\n\n325\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.830\nvirtualization to say, hey, I'm gonna\ngive you one of these processors.\n\n326\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.020\nYou can have it virtual machine.\n\n327\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.240\nIn this case, it's gonna be, what is this?\n\n328\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.710\nWhat am I looking at?\n\n329\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.970\nI'm looking at the Windows 7\nvirtual machine, all right.\n\n330\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:18.860\nI can say all right, Adam that's 16\ngigs of RAM, I'm gonna give you 4 gigs.\n\n331\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.830\nOr maybe, and here's what you always\nhave to keep in mind, I don't care,\n\n332\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.920\nagain server-side,\nclient-side virtualization.\n\n333\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.890\nYou do have, when it comes to resource\nrequirements, you have limitations.\n\n334\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.270\nWhat's limitation?\n\n335\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.230\nYou're limited by whatever\nthe host the test.\n\n336\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.916\nBut you also got to keep in mind that\nif I have 16 Gigs of RAM in my machine,\n\n337\n00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:41.382\nit doesn't mean I can give 4 gigs, 4 gigs,\n4 and 4 to 4 different virtual machines.\n\n338\n00:17:41.382 --> 00:17:44.669\nBecause the question then remains,\nwait a second,\n\n339\n00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:48.060\nwhat is the host operating\nsystem gonna use?\n\n340\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.980\nSo you also have your host operating\nsystem that needs to run its resources.\n\n341\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.750\nWhich is another one of the reasons a type\none hypervisor is better for production,\n\n342\n00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.190\nbecause I can now locate all my RAM.\n\n343\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.780\nThe hypervisor is just gonna communicate\na very, very small footprint.\n\n344\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.520\nAll right, but maybe I decide,\nyou know what Dan?\n\n345\n00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.066\nI'm running out of resources,\n\n346\n00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:11.225\nI've allocated a little bit too\nmuch RAM to one of these devices.\n\n347\n00:18:11.225 --> 00:18:13.167\nSo I decide that you know what,\n\n348\n00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:18.090\nI don't need to give all of that\nRAM from a single operating system.\n\n349\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.460\nSo now I can back this RAM down\nwhat I'm allocating to it.\n\n350\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.310\nNow if this was a physical machine,\n\n351\n00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.220\nwhat would the resource\nrequirement to do be there?\n\n352\n00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.830\nI'd have to shut the machine down.\n\n353\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.963\n&gt;&gt; Pull out the screwdriver.\n\n354\n00:18:29.963 --> 00:18:31.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n355\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.270\nOpen the box, and then I'd have to pull\nthe stick out, and then I'd have to go\n\n356\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.060\nphysically walk over to another\nmachine and I have to install it.\n\n357\n00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.200\nSo we have a very easy way to\nbump back and forth right.\n\n358\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.430\nSo do keep that in mind all right.\n\n359\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.290\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention the fact that you\nhave the Google search if it didn't have\n\n360\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.120\nthe specifications on the RAM.\n\n361\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.460\nIt's already in there,\nget the correct kind of RAM.\n\n362\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.050\nIf you don't have it already,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n363\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.300\nI wanna change processors, what\nprocessors, what kinda socket do I have?\n\n364\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.760\nIt's a lot more intensive\nthan working with, okay,\n\n365\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.540\nI'll build one machine on one platform and\nif I want multiple operating systems,\n\n366\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.580\nyeah I could probably go dual boot or\nmulti-boot.\n\n367\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.460\nBut this virtualization\nbusiness is a whole lot easier.\n\n368\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n369\n00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.180\nAnd some of the other benefits of\nVMs too is the fact that if we're\n\n370\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.120\nlooking at my screen right here,\nI've got what are known as snapshots.\n\n371\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n372\n00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.040\n&gt;&gt; And I take these a lot right?\n\n373\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.780\nSo we had an episode where we're talking\nabout the Windows updates right?\n\n374\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.200\nAnd I wanted to make sure that everything\nwent off without a hitch right or\n\n375\n00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.120\nhowever you would say that.\n\n376\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.410\nIs that right?\n\n377\n00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay thank you Dan,\n\n378\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.240\ngotta have Dan here for\nsome of the English here.\n\n379\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Dead on.\n[LAUGH] And\n\n380\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.318\nit get's you like a book of sayings.\n\n381\n00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:38.596\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say I am multi lingual\n\n382\n00:19:38.596 --> 00:19:42.472\nI speak three languages,\nI speak good english, worser english and\n\n383\n00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:43.769\neven worser english.\n\n384\n00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:45.348\n&gt;&gt; You're like the bartender\nfrom Boondock saints.\n\n385\n00:19:45.348 --> 00:19:46.169\n&gt;&gt; Yes absolutely.\n[LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:19:46.169 --> 00:19:48.057\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:19:48.057 --> 00:19:50.543\n&gt;&gt; So what's the benefit of snapshots?\n\n388\n00:19:50.543 --> 00:19:54.125\nWell if I make a configuration error,\nwhich I do often from time to time,\n\n389\n00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:57.649\nI really stress test Windows, I put\nit through the ringer if you will and\n\n390\n00:19:57.649 --> 00:20:01.150\nI make configurations,\njust kinda see whats gonna happen.\n\n391\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.570\nWell what happens if I make a mistake?\n\n392\n00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.130\nWell that's okay, what I'm gonna\ndo is I restore this snapshot.\n\n393\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.090\nI'm gonna do this right here on camera and\nI'm not gonna save anything.\n\n394\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.695\nAnd its gonna restore it back to\nthat earlier point in time and\n\n395\n00:20:11.695 --> 00:20:14.720\nit's like I can get out of jail free card\nwithout having a run in on some of those\n\n396\n00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.990\nsystem recovery utilities that we've\ntalked about in other episodes, right?\n\n397\n00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.470\nSo that's very beneficial.\n\n398\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.830\nSo those are some of the purposes\nof virtual machines and\n\n399\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.990\nsome of the things to keep in mind,\nthe resource requirements, all right?\n\n400\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.640\nThe other thing I wanna talk about,\nthey mention, and\n\n401\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.660\nI've already kinda talked\nabout hypervisor here.\n\n402\n00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.220\nLadies and\n\n403\n00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:36.700\ngentlemen there is a very confusing term a\nlot of times that is used interchangeably.\n\n404\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.352\nYou'll hear hypervisor and\nyou'll hear emulator.\n\n405\n00:20:40.352 --> 00:20:44.238\nThey're used interchangeably but\ntechnically they are not the same thing,\n\n406\n00:20:44.238 --> 00:20:44.843\nall right?\n\n407\n00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:49.605\nA hypervisor's purpose is to allow\nyou to have multiple operating\n\n408\n00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:53.780\nsystems running on a single\nphysical device, all right?\n\n409\n00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.930\nAn emulator is something\nthat represents in software\n\n410\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.930\na replication of physical hardware.\n\n411\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.710\nNow you might say, well,\nwait a second, how is that different?\n\n412\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.320\nI want you to think of now,\nthose of you who are gamers out there.\n\n413\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.420\nSo this will probably click right away.\n\n414\n00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.520\nAll right, I have a game that\nonly runs on the NES system.\n\n415\n00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.350\nDo I virtualize it?\n\n416\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.280\nNo, I still have the ROM.\n\n417\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.440\nI have the ROM from the NES\ngame that I still have.\n\n418\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.530\nBut my NES is broken.\n\n419\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:26.640\nSo what do they do?\n\n420\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.740\nThey have emulators out there that as\na software device software application,\n\n421\n00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.350\nthat purposely, or actually purposely,\n\n422\n00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:40.150\nyeah, perfectly is what I meant to say,\nallows that ROM to believe\n\n423\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.225\nit's on the same physical hardware\nthat it was originally intended.\n\n424\n00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:46.349\nLittle bit different, right [CROSSTALK] So\nthere's a slight variation.\n\n425\n00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:47.650\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of a translator right?\n\n426\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n427\n00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.370\nSo sometimes in a testing environment,\n\n428\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.020\nall right, our dev team is\nworking on an iOS app, right?\n\n429\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.530\nWe don't have an iOS device,\nso what can we do?\n\n430\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.100\nWell we can go get and\niOS device emulator.\n\n431\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.850\nAnd what it does is it allows them\nto test that software on that iOS\n\n432\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.759\nemulator because it's\nemulating a physical device.\n\n433\n00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.670\nOr the Android, there's Android\nemulators out there, right?\n\n434\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:21.330\nI need an Android tablet, but my company\ndoesn't, at this point, wanna go out and\n\n435\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.020\nspend $800 to buy an Android tablet\njust to test an application that may or\n\n436\n00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.200\nmay not run.\n\n437\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.700\nWe get an emulator,\nan emulator represents,\n\n438\n00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.115\nreplicates that physical hardware.\n\n439\n00:22:31.115 --> 00:22:33.300\nThe hypervisor's purpose is close, but\n\n440\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.750\nit allows you essentially\naccess to physical hardware.\n\n441\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.790\n&gt;&gt; It's not emulating the hardware.\n\n442\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.020\n&gt;&gt; But it's not emulating it.\n\n443\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.480\n&gt;&gt; But it's not emulating anything.\n\n444\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.418\n&gt;&gt; It's really there.\nIt's real hardware.\n\n445\n00:22:41.418 --> 00:22:43.530\nIt's like, you want RAM, there's the RAM.\n\n446\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.290\nThis is real RAM,\nit's the RAM that's in your machine.\n\n447\n00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.660\nI'm just sharing it between\nthe host operating system and\n\n448\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.490\nthe guest operating system.\n\n449\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.795\n&gt;&gt; And let's give an example.\n\n450\n00:22:51.795 --> 00:22:57.410\nOn a hypervisor, the operating system has\nto have the same hardware architecture\n\n451\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.830\nas the physical device that the hypervisor\nis allowing me to communicate.\n\n452\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.010\nAn emulator, I don't need that.\n\n453\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.610\nAn emulator is a software representation,\na replica.\n\n454\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have an SNES\nchip inside of our computers, but\n\n455\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.860\nthat ROM is looking for that chip.\n\n456\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.940\nIt's looking for that specific\narchitecture that we don't have.\n\n457\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.710\nSo the emulator pretends that it's that.\n\n458\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely, so\ndon't let that confuse you.\n\n459\n00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.770\nWhen it comes to emulator requirements and\nhypervisors,\n\n460\n00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.880\nthe requirements are typically the same.\n\n461\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.660\nIf it's a hypervisor,\nI need the same architecture\n\n462\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.660\nthat the operating system that\nI'm gonna virtualize runs on.\n\n463\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.719\nIf it's an emulator, the software\nthat's gonna run in the emulator needs,\n\n464\n00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:41.030\nthat emulator needs the same requirements\nof the original physical platform that\n\n465\n00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.041\nit's emulating.\n\n466\n00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:43.353\nDon't let it confuse you.\n\n467\n00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:48.665\nThe last thing I wanna talk about here\nare two very, very important things.\n\n468\n00:23:48.665 --> 00:23:51.394\nOne they talk about network requirements,\nall right.\n\n469\n00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:54.944\nFirst thing that you have to remember\nwith any network requirement,\n\n470\n00:23:54.944 --> 00:23:58.258\nyou have to have a network and\nyou have to have a network adapter.\n\n471\n00:23:58.258 --> 00:24:00.702\nSee what I mean [LAUGH], case dismissed.\n\n472\n00:24:00.702 --> 00:24:01.525\nNo, just kidding.\n\n473\n00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:03.530\n[LAUGH] Well,\nlet's go a little further with that.\n\n474\n00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.990\nThere are different kinda interactions\nwith the network that you can have\n\n475\n00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.460\na virtual machine do.\n\n476\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.650\nIn fact let me go ahead and show you here\nin our VMware Fusion on my Mac, right?\n\n477\n00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:18.840\nSo if I take the Windows 7 machine\nin VMware Fusion on my desktop here,\n\n478\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.530\nand I go to the Settings,\n\n479\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:26.890\nI have the ability with the network\nadapter to do a few things, all right?\n\n480\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:30.220\nI'm gonna just, cuz Dan mentioned\nthe vendor neutrality on this,\n\n481\n00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.260\nthey call it different things\nwith different vendors.\n\n482\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.220\nI'm gonna be very generic here, okay?\n\n483\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.988\nYou have what's know as\nguest-to-guest communication,\n\n484\n00:24:37.988 --> 00:24:41.910\nyou have guest-to-host communication,\nand guest-to-LAN communication.\n\n485\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.925\nAnd that's as generic as I can get.\n\n486\n00:24:43.925 --> 00:24:46.420\nHyper-V's gonna call it\nsomething different.\n\n487\n00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.570\nYou'll see here in VMware they\ncall it Internet sharing,\n\n488\n00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.475\nbridge networking, and customization.\n\n489\n00:24:51.475 --> 00:24:58.850\nHyper-V calls it an internal network,\na external network, and a private network.\n\n490\n00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.850\nSo they have different terminologies.\n\n491\n00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.790\nIt boils down to these three\ngenerically that talked about.\n\n492\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.380\nGuest-to-guest, guest-to-host,\nguest-to-LAN.\n\n493\n00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.220\nLet's talk about what they are.\n\n494\n00:25:08.335 --> 00:25:12.950\nGuest-to-guest means these\nvirtual machines can communicate\n\n495\n00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.112\namongst themselves and nothing else.\n\n496\n00:25:16.112 --> 00:25:20.150\nThey cannot communicate with the host\noperating system that they're running on.\n\n497\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.828\nWhen I say guest-to-host,\nthat's exactly what I mean.\n\n498\n00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:27.766\nThe guest virtual machine, the virtualized\nmachines that we're running here can\n\n499\n00:25:27.766 --> 00:25:30.260\nin this case can talk to my Mac.\n\n500\n00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.880\nIf I'm running a client-side Hyper-V,\n\n501\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.370\nthat means essentially that the guest\nvirtual machine can talk to the Windows\n\n502\n00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.490\nhost that it's running on,\nthat's why the guest to host.\n\n503\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.560\nNow, what if I want these machines, here?\n\n504\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.170\nIn this case, let me show you.\n\n505\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.440\nWe're gonna launch up\nour Windows 8.1 machine,\n\n506\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.210\nthat's a virtual machine running,\nand I actually gave this\n\n507\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.130\nnetwork access because I'm doing\nsomething in the background.\n\n508\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.210\nAnd you guys can kinda see this.\n\n509\n00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:57.750\nThis is unscripted here, so bear with me,\nyou know how unscripted works for me.\n\n510\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.892\n&gt;&gt; Wes falls down the stairs and\nlands on his feet.\n\n511\n00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.760\n&gt;&gt; So I'm actually needing this for\ntesting purpose, cuz I'm\n\n512\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.320\nin a Mac environment, I need to run\ndiagnostic and recovery toolkit, right.\n\n513\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.070\nBut I don't have access to it.\n\n514\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.760\nSo what do I do?\n\n515\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.623\nFor testing purposes, actually,\n\n516\n00:26:11.623 --> 00:26:15.850\nI'm using this, and what I'm doing is\nI'm giving it physical network access.\n\n517\n00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.270\nIt can access our network.\n\n518\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:22.630\nAnd in fact, if I was to, let's say\njust fire up PowerShell here, all right?\n\n519\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.112\nAnd I run whatever that was.\n\n520\n00:26:26.112 --> 00:26:28.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; cd \\ and do a clear here.\n\n521\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.050\nAnd I run a ping against.\n\n522\n00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.880\nLike, we'll do somewhere out\nthere across the Internet.\n\n523\n00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.960\nNotice that I'm getting replies.\n\n524\n00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.360\nIt is communicating with\nthe local area network, and\n\n525\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.480\nthat's why I said guest-to-LAN,\njust generically.\n\n526\n00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.250\nAgain, all the different vendors\ncall it different things.\n\n527\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.310\nSo network requirements really depends.\n\n528\n00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.560\nDo you just want complete isolation?\n\n529\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.300\nIf you want complete isolation, then what\nyou're gonna do is make sure that only\n\n530\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.360\nthe virtual machines can\ncommunicate between each other.\n\n531\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.645\nIf you need to, let's say, send a file\nfrom my Mac in this case over to one of\n\n532\n00:26:59.645 --> 00:27:03.409\nthese virtual machines,\nthen what I do is, I share with my Mac.\n\n533\n00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:05.190\nWell, there's a couple of\ndifferent things that you can do.\n\n534\n00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.740\nI could do guest-to-host communication.\n\n535\n00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.460\nThis one here is called Internet sharing.\n\n536\n00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.030\nThis is kinda like ICS,\nInternet connection sharing.\n\n537\n00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.854\nAnd what it would do is build up a network\naddress translation communication and\n\n538\n00:27:14.854 --> 00:27:18.060\nhide the fact that I'm communicating\ndirectly with the network.\n\n539\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.090\nThe last one is if I need the virtual\nmachine to actually communicate,\n\n540\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.316\nlike I just showed you with\nthe Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n541\n00:27:25.316 --> 00:27:28.880\nI need it to communicate outbound to\nthe Internet to download something inside\n\n542\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.958\nof the virtual machine,\nI give it guest-to-LAN communication.\n\n543\n00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:35.592\nLast thing I want to just mention real\nbriefly, they talk about security.\n\n544\n00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:37.542\nNow, security.\n\n545\n00:27:37.542 --> 00:27:42.023\nYou have to secure your virtual machines\nin every way that you secure your\n\n546\n00:27:42.023 --> 00:27:43.350\nphysical machines.\n\n547\n00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.871\nThey are full-blown operating systems\nfunctioning just like a normal host\n\n548\n00:27:47.871 --> 00:27:49.433\noperating system would.\n\n549\n00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:53.408\nThat's the purpose of the hypervisor,\nit makes it transparent to the guest that\n\n550\n00:27:53.408 --> 00:27:57.270\nit's actually a software representation\nof physical devices, all right?\n\n551\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.091\nThe other thing I want to mention is,\nI've been mentioning, I say we,\n\n552\n00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:01.793\nI've been doing a lot of the talking here.\n\n553\n00:28:01.793 --> 00:28:04.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned isolation.\n\n554\n00:28:04.556 --> 00:28:10.017\nTrue isolation only happens if you only\nallow guest-to-guest communication.\n\n555\n00:28:10.017 --> 00:28:14.264\nSo, understand something, if you\nare testing viruses, sometimes we do that,\n\n556\n00:28:14.264 --> 00:28:18.880\nwe test security software cuz we wanna\nsee if we can catch it and lock it down.\n\n557\n00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.360\nIf it's guest-to-guest communication,\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n558\n00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.505\nIt's completely isolated,\n\n559\n00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:25.490\ncuz only the virtual machines can\ncommunicate with other virtual machines.\n\n560\n00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.130\nI don't have to worry about\nthe host getting infected.\n\n561\n00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.682\nThe moment you open up\nguest-to-host communication,\n\n562\n00:28:30.682 --> 00:28:34.138\nanything that happens to the host,\nanything that happens to the guest become\n\n563\n00:28:34.138 --> 00:28:37.502\nsymbiotic or parasitic, depending\non how you're looking at it, right?\n\n564\n00:28:37.502 --> 00:28:39.054\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So be careful,\n\n565\n00:28:39.054 --> 00:28:40.846\nthat is a security vulnerability.\n\n566\n00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:43.860\nThose are some of the things you need\nto know in client-side virtualization.\n\n567\n00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.090\nDan, I think I got it all, but\n\n568\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.910\nI do know that we're probably\nburning the clock on this one.\n\n569\n00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, we're good to go.\n\n570\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.050\nI think you covered the basics.\n\n571\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.800\nIt was a really good\nprimer on virtualization.\n\n572\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.250\nSo if you're new to virtualization,\nyou've never seen it before, or\n\n573\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.090\nyou just heard of it but\nnever really experienced it.\n\n574\n00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:02.350\nWes has done a really good job of\nkinda taking you from soup to nuts.\n\n575\n00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.550\nWhat you need to know as\nfar as virtualization goes.\n\n576\n00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.220\nIf you have worked with virtualization\nbefore, maybe there were some concepts\n\n577\n00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.650\nthat you didn't quite understand, or\nyou weren't really that familiar with.\n\n578\n00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.410\nAnd now hopefully that has\nbeen cleared up for you.\n\n579\n00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.510\nAnd if you've used virtualization,\nyou're pretty good at it,\n\n580\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.290\nyou've worked with it extensively.\n\n581\n00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.440\nNow you know what is gonna be on the exam,\nso you're prepared for that.\n\n582\n00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.710\nSo, whatever way you slice it, this should\nhave been a very good episode for you,\n\n583\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.770\nand Wes, it was really well done.\n\n584\n00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:28.720\nI appreciate you-\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n585\n00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Just dropping by.\n\n586\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.520\nBut you're running out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n587\n00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.700\nMan, it's too bad, cuz I love\nvirtualization, as well as Wes does.\n\n588\n00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.805\nSo, I guess we're gonna have to sign off.\n\n589\n00:29:36.805 --> 00:29:38.138\nWell.\nSigning off for ITProTV,\n\n590\n00:29:38.138 --> 00:29:39.533\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n591\n00:29:39.533 --> 00:29:40.381\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n592\n00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:42.134\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.679\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.629\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.561\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.870\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode it's all about the A+ Series.\n\n7\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.627\nThat's right, continuing on in that track,\nour 220-902 to be exact.\n\n8\n00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.832\nAnd joining us back in the studio, you\nknow him, you love him, he's number one in\n\n9\n00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.320\nyour hearts, he is Mr. Wes Bryan, let's\nwelcome back, sir how's it going on today?\n\n10\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.835\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great, thanks for\nsetting the bar pretty high on this one.\n\n11\n00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.502\nHopefully you'll help me hold\ndown that bar up for sure.\n\n12\n00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:38.965\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Good luck with that.\n\n13\n00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:40.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but\n\n14\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.490\nlike Dan says that's right, we're back\nwith more of our 902 exam content,\n\n15\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.800\nand we're gonna be moving into,\nwell, we're gonna take your head and\n\n16\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.701\nput it right in the clouds today,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n17\n00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.113\nSome might say well,\nthat's where my head is every day.\n\n18\n00:00:53.113 --> 00:00:56.427\nBut [LAUGH] joking aside, ladies and\ngentlemen out there, we're gonna talk\n\n19\n00:00:56.427 --> 00:01:00.250\nabout some of the basic Cloud concepts\nthat you have to be aware of for the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.485\nMoving along in our objectives, if you're\nfollowing along out there we're looking at\n\n21\n00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:06.260\n2.3, identify basic cloud concepts.\n\n22\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.290\nSo as far as the objective title goes,\n\n23\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.940\nit's pretty similar to what you'll see if\nyou are looking at the exam objectives.\n\n24\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.360\nNow, cloud concepts right when we talk\nabout cloud concepts I want you ladies and\n\n25\n00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.190\ngentleman out there to understand that\nvirtualization that we've talked about in\n\n26\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.710\na past episode, it's really how we get\ncloud based technologies today, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.630\nThe ability to run more than one\n\n28\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.570\ninstance of an operating system on\na single physical device, right?\n\n29\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.379\nOn a much larger scale though, it's\nserver side virtualization through things\n\n30\n00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:44.640\nlike clustering multiple servers\ntogether and they work in tandem.\n\n31\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.044\nWe have this large data centers that\nallow, through a paid or measured service,\n\n32\n00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:56.801\nallow you to go to a provider essentially\nand buy the resources you need.\n\n33\n00:01:56.801 --> 00:02:00.400\nDepending on what it is that you're\ntrying to accomplish, all right?\n\n34\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.820\nSo I went ahead and I talked about, right\noff the top, measured service, all right?\n\n35\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.780\nWhat do we mean when we\nsay measured service?\n\n36\n00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.290\nWell, one of the benefits\nof the cloud is that, well,\n\n37\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.590\nyou don't have to maintain a lot\nof your own infrastructure, right?\n\n38\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.030\nYou can go to a provider.\n\n39\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.802\nAnd when I say a provider, I'm not talking\nabout an internet service provider,\n\n40\n00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:21.059\nbecause you're still gonna need\nan internet service provider.\n\n41\n00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.602\nBecause it requires\nan internet connection for\n\n42\n00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:27.810\nthe majority of our cloud-based models.\n\n43\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.067\nNow, one of them doesn't really require an\nInternet connection, but usually when you\n\n44\n00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:38.052\nget to this scale of one of the models,\nyou're gonna have an Internet connection.\n\n45\n00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:42.480\nA lot of times just due to\nthe geographical distribution.\n\n46\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.318\nWe'll talk about cloud types here,\ncoming up, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:48.113\nBut, either way, it's going to be\na measured service, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:53.583\nAnd a measured service means that,\ndepending on how much computational power,\n\n49\n00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.165\nhow many applications we need to run.\n\n50\n00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:58.001\nHow many users we're going to have,\n\n51\n00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:02.130\nwhat kinds of virtual machines we\nneed to support our infrastructure.\n\n52\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.650\nWe're gonna pay.\n\n53\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.980\nBut the great thing about\nthis is you're only pay for\n\n54\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.350\nthose services that you need, all right?\n\n55\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.020\nSo, we go ahead and compare and\ncontrast, if you will, a little bit,\n\n56\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.213\ncloud versus what we call on-premises.\n\n57\n00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:19.032\nBecause these are two concepts that\nwhile they don't really call them\n\n58\n00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:23.626\nout on the exam, generically speaking you\nneed to be aware of the difference between\n\n59\n00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:28.350\non-premise resources in a measured\nservice or a cloud based resource.\n\n60\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.655\nAnd when we say on-premise, all right,\nif we were to walk over to the ITPro.TV\n\n61\n00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:36.620\nserver closet, you would see that we\nhave a series of servers in there.\n\n62\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.740\nWe have switches,\nwe have all kinds of video gear,\n\n63\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.624\ncommunication gear,\nvoice-over IP technologies, right.\n\n64\n00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:45.160\nOn-premises right?\n\n65\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.944\nThat's within our local building.\n\n66\n00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:53.060\nNow the thing to keep in mind about that\nis that we need to manage and maintain it.\n\n67\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.110\nNow thank goodness Wes doesn't\nhave to manage and maintain,\n\n68\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.610\nor we probably wouldn't be able to\neven bring you this video right now.\n\n69\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.460\nWe have some people that are trained and\nthey can manage and maintain this.\n\n70\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.100\nA lot of the people that you don't see,\n\n71\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.420\nthe majority of the people that\nyou don't see behind the cameras,\n\n72\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.280\nare the ones that are trained in order\nto bring us this content, right?\n\n73\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.990\nBut that's people we have within\nour physical building, all right?\n\n74\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.382\nYou might be a company that maybe\nyou don't want to go through,\n\n75\n00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:23.734\nand I say problem, it sounds like you guys\nout there that are helping us edit these\n\n76\n00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:28.215\nvideos and stuff, and helping us bring\nthis content, you guys aren't problems,\n\n77\n00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:29.588\nthat's not what I mean.\n\n78\n00:04:29.588 --> 00:04:32.988\n[LAUGH] Your company might not have\nthe additional resources, right,\n\n79\n00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.610\nthat it takes, because it does.\n\n80\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.360\nIt takes money.\n\n81\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.160\nIt takes time.\n\n82\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.387\nIt takes effort, right, to train people\nto manage a server, to manage a switch,\n\n83\n00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:42.551\nto manage a voiceover IP communication.\n\n84\n00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:47.054\nIn order to be able to edit and\nstream these videos, to stream them,\n\n85\n00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:50.370\nif you will, out to you guys, right?\n\n86\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.240\nSo what can you do?\n\n87\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.910\nIf you're a company that doesn't\nhave those additional resources,\n\n88\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.840\nwhat do you do?\n\n89\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.370\nWell, you get a measured service.\n\n90\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.270\nYou go to a provider that says,\nhey, you know what?\n\n91\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.060\nWe've got a huge network.\n\n92\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.670\nIn fact, we've got networks all over the,\n\n93\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.830\nlet's say the continental United States,\nor even North America, right?\n\n94\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.030\nInternationally, we have networks.\n\n95\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.880\nAnd I tell you what,\nif you come to us, you give us money,\n\n96\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.670\nwe'll charge you monthly for this service.\n\n97\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.021\nAnd depending on what you need,\nwe'll give you access to our network.\n\n98\n00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:27.981\nBut what you don't have to do is\nmanage the network, and you don't have\n\n99\n00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:33.037\nto pay the electrical costs that it\ntakes to keep the equipment running.\n\n100\n00:05:33.037 --> 00:05:35.210\nYou don't have to have the technicians.\n\n101\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.010\nYou don't have to train\nthe technicians in order to use these.\n\n102\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.781\nWe'll do that for you.\n\n103\n00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:41.680\nAnd that's one of\nthe benefits of the cloud.\n\n104\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.200\nThe cloud says well you know what?\n\n105\n00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.050\nWe'll pay somebody to use their network.\n\n106\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.150\nWe'll pay somebody to\nuse their applications.\n\n107\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.720\nAnd they're gonna manage updates.\n\n108\n00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.695\nThey're gonna manage the Flaws.\n\n109\n00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.605\nThe development side of it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.725\nThe management and maintaining of that.\n\n111\n00:05:57.725 --> 00:06:00.615\nAnd all you have to do is\njust connect to the Internet.\n\n112\n00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:05.435\n&gt;&gt; So we're basically outsourcing at\nleast a lot of the administration\n\n113\n00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:09.405\nthat would go into a standard\non-premises network.\n\n114\n00:06:09.405 --> 00:06:11.745\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n115\n00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:16.010\nAll right, so\nwhat different models do we have, right?\n\n116\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.940\nWell, we have to understand that,\nagain like I said,\n\n117\n00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.660\nIt's based on what you might need to do,\nall right?\n\n118\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.278\nMaybe you're one that says, you know what?\n\n119\n00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:25.340\nI don't wanna set up email servers,\nI don't wanna set up a web\n\n120\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.540\napplication server to serve up\nsome kind of web application.\n\n121\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.180\nI don't wanna have to manage and\nmaintain line of business software.\n\n122\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.280\nWell, it's great that you have\na platform that will allow you to\n\n123\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.320\nbasically pay somebody else to do that.\n\n124\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.170\nAnd the first one that\nwe talk about though,\n\n125\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.560\nyou'll see that these terms\nare abbreviated, SaaS.\n\n126\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.320\nThat's something known as\nSoftware as a Service.\n\n127\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.240\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive\ninto a little diagram that I've got,\n\n128\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.570\nthat kind of explains what\nSoftware as a Service is.\n\n129\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.300\nAll right,\nnow I had to put a cloud in there, right?\n\n130\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.430\nWe can't talk about a cloud.\n\n131\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.080\nBut really when it comes down to it.\n\n132\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.259\n&gt;&gt; We actually have a visual cloud.\n\n133\n00:06:59.259 --> 00:06:59.785\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n134\n00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:00.715\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n135\n00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:03.900\n[LAUGH] Keep in mind it's up\nthere on the internet, right?\n\n136\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.460\nThe world wide web, if you will.\n\n137\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.982\n&gt;&gt; What we used to call\nthe cloud was the web.\n\n138\n00:07:07.982 --> 00:07:10.690\nIt's run from a web, now it's a cloud.\n\n139\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.920\nGod know what it'll be in the future.\n\n140\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n141\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.730\nAs long as it's not a storm,\nwe're okay, right?\n\n142\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.780\nSo keep in mind that what you're doing\nhere essentially is, you are paying\n\n143\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.320\nsomebody else that has the infrastructure\nto support the applications.\n\n144\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.380\nAnd they maintain them and\nwhat you do is you pay per user and\n\n145\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.045\nper amount of applications\nthat you're using.\n\n146\n00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:32.680\nSome of you probably used it before and\nyou didn't even realize it, right?\n\n147\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.820\nHave ever used something like Gmail,\nHotmail, Outlook if you will.\n\n148\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.430\nYou've used it.\n\n149\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.640\nHave you ever used Google Doc?\n\n150\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.480\nHave you ever used Outlook?\n\n151\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.463\nNot Outlook, but Office 365?\n\n152\n00:07:42.463 --> 00:07:44.864\nThis is Software as a Service, right?\n\n153\n00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:47.983\nBecause you're going to their platform.\n\n154\n00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:50.355\nAnd, yeah, you've got to a little\nbit of configuration, right,\n\n155\n00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:51.780\nyou're got to set up your user account.\n\n156\n00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.094\n&gt;&gt; Even things like Facebook and Instagram\nwould be considered Software as a Service\n\n157\n00:07:55.094 --> 00:07:56.832\nbecause they are giving you an interface.\n\n158\n00:07:56.832 --> 00:07:58.361\nThat is completely controlled by them.\n\n159\n00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:02.760\nYou just log in and utilize the interface,\nwhich is a type of software.\n\n160\n00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.809\n&gt;&gt; That is a great analogy.\n\n161\n00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:08.290\nSocial media is a classic example\nof software as a service.\n\n162\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.268\nDo you manage the servers at Facebook?\n\n163\n00:08:10.268 --> 00:08:12.451\nIf you've ever seen the size\nof their warehouses,\n\n164\n00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.192\nyou're probably glad that you don't.\n\n165\n00:08:14.192 --> 00:08:15.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n166\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.080\nYou don't manage the servers\non the backend when\n\n167\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.163\nit comes to things like\nyour Gmail account, right?\n\n168\n00:08:21.163 --> 00:08:22.442\nSometimes they're free.\n\n169\n00:08:22.442 --> 00:08:24.720\nOkay, so understand you're like,\nwell, those are all free.\n\n170\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.109\nThose aren't a measured or\npaid service in any way.\n\n171\n00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:30.654\nNo, they're not, but you can definitely\nget into a paid account where\n\n172\n00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:34.450\nif you do this and integrate it in\nbusiness, you're gonna pay, all right?\n\n173\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.625\nSo that's one of the things.\n\n174\n00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:39.600\nNow what's one of the other benefits of\nall these different technologies, right?\n\n175\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.630\nWe get what's known as redundancy and\nrecovery.\n\n176\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.680\nWhat do I mean by redundancy?\n\n177\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.080\nI want you to think about the last time\noutside of your Internet connection,\n\n178\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.110\nwhether it's your fault, your device's\nfault, your ISP's fault, how many\n\n179\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.460\ntimes have you ever had to walk over and\nreboot a server if you've got Gmail or\n\n180\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:03.020\nyou've got Hotmail, Outlook.com\nas it is called today, Yahoomail.\n\n181\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.810\nProbably never once, right?\n\n182\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.110\nThat's because on the back end,\ntheir technicians, when a server fails or\n\n183\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.320\na cluster, a group of servers fail,\nthey fail you over to another site and\n\n184\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.900\nit's transparent to you.\n\n185\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.680\nSo you get the benefit of redundancy\nwithout having to manage it on-premise,\n\n186\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.490\nrecovery, if you will.\n\n187\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.160\nWhen's the last time you've actually had\nto roll out and develop, manage, and\n\n188\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.700\nmaintain updates for Facebook,\nfor Twitter, for LinkedIn, right?\n\n189\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.959\nGMail, YMail, probably never, right?\n\n190\n00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:35.173\nThat's because on the back end,\nthey're the ones doing it.\n\n191\n00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:38.226\nAnd that's one of the benefits of\na cloud-based solution like software as\n\n192\n00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:39.650\na service here.\n\n193\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.910\nSame thing with the maintenance,\nwhat do you need?\n\n194\n00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.810\nWell, the only thing that we need to\nwork really worry about on our end\n\n195\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.515\nin paying our Internet bill.\n\n196\n00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:50.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Having Internet connection.\n\n197\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.790\nHaving some kind of ISP.\n\n198\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:57.880\nAnd one of the most prevalent pieces\nsoftware within any operating system,\n\n199\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.440\nthe web browser.\n\n200\n00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.239\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n201\n00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:01.889\nthe web browser needs to connect.\n\n202\n00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:04.210\nAnd again,\nthat's one of the beneficial things.\n\n203\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.520\nReason I start here is cuz\nit's one of the most common\n\n204\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.500\nin today's environments, right?\n\n205\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.420\nBecause some of these other ones\nthat we're gonna talk about,\n\n206\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.080\nwe're gonna talk about\nplatform as a service,\n\n207\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.770\nwe're gonna talk about\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n208\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.550\nBehind the scenes,\n\n209\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.130\nif you're just getting into this,\nyou might not be able to relate to that.\n\n210\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.600\nBut it's a very rare day in today's\nsociety, today's day and time, time and\n\n211\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.930\nday, if you will,\nthat somebody can't at least relate to\n\n212\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.580\nhaving some kinda hosted software\nas a service based email.\n\n213\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.410\nRight, cloud-based email solution.\n\n214\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.940\nAnd like Dan said, things like social\nmedia technologies that are out there.\n\n215\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.810\nWordPress is another one.\n\n216\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.587\nSome of them blur the line because they do\nallow you to set up your own on-premise\n\n217\n00:10:42.587 --> 00:10:44.290\nand cloud-based solution.\n\n218\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.530\nNow when we start mixing on-premise and\ncloud-based solutions,\n\n219\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.750\nthey become what are known as hybrids.\n\n220\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.300\nCuz why?\n\n221\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.490\nWell, it's not strictly\na cloud-based solution only.\n\n222\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.606\nIt's not strictly an on-premise.\n\n223\n00:10:58.606 --> 00:11:02.950\nIt's actually two different models at\nthe same time, so they'll call it hybrid.\n\n224\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.129\nWe'll talk about another situation which\nyou can also see hybrid as well, but\n\n225\n00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:07.491\nthat's definitely one of them.\n\n226\n00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:09.997\nNow I mentioned\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n227\n00:11:09.997 --> 00:11:13.953\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nswitch to infrastructure as a service.\n\n228\n00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:15.929\nWhy don't you think about this, all right?\n\n229\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.430\nYour company needs to be able to have 100\n\n230\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.310\ndesktop experiences with 100\nline of business applications.\n\n231\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.700\nWell, one of the great things, we have\nan offering, a service, if you will,\n\n232\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.280\nanother measured service,\ncalled infrastructure as a service.\n\n233\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.730\nAnd what that does is it provides you with\nthe computational resources that you need\n\n234\n00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.580\nto run thins like operating systems,\nright?\n\n235\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.100\nWe talked about virtualization\nin another episode.\n\n236\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.900\nIn which I can run virtual machines,\nmore than one virtual machine,\n\n237\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.350\nmore than one operating system\non a single physical device.\n\n238\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.730\nImagine being able to serve\nthat up to your end-users and\n\n239\n00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.510\nall they have to do is log into a desktop.\n\n240\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.814\nAnd you don't have to manage the computer,\nthe operating system updates,\n\n241\n00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.522\nyou don't have to manage some\nof the things in the background.\n\n242\n00:11:56.522 --> 00:11:58.198\nYou don't have to worry about RAM failing,\n\n243\n00:11:58.198 --> 00:11:59.929\nyou don't have to worry\nabout a CPU failing.\n\n244\n00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:02.020\nYou don't wanna have to worry\nabout a hard drive failing either.\n\n245\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.221\nAll you have to do is pay somebody, you\nhave to worry about the pocketbook, right?\n\n246\n00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:08.684\nAnd the other thing, too,\n\n247\n00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:12.510\nabout this that's really great is\nit's got scalability, all right.\n\n248\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.070\nIt's what we call on demand, right?\n\n249\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.150\nNow when we say on demand,\n\n250\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.440\nagain it's relative to the money\nthat you have to pay somebody.\n\n251\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.620\nBut let's say today Dan says,\nhey, you know what, Wes?\n\n252\n00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.599\nI'm gonna have 100 users.\n\n253\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.929\nAnd these 100 users,\n\n254\n00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:29.141\nI'm gonna need them to have these\nsoftware applications, right?\n\n255\n00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:32.146\nAnd that's where we get\ninto software as a service.\n\n256\n00:12:32.146 --> 00:12:33.680\nI say, okay, Dan, I got that set up.\n\n257\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.912\nWe've got our software as a service,\nwe've got an Office 365 account, right?\n\n258\n00:12:37.912 --> 00:12:41.090\nAnd it gives us Excel,\nit gives us Notepad, it gives us Word,\n\n259\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.630\nit gives us Outlook, right?\n\n260\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.852\nSo now we've got our email set up.\n\n261\n00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:48.450\nBut Dan says, also I'm gonna need them\nto be able to log into desktops too.\n\n262\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.060\nWell, that's where infrastructure\nas a service comes, right?\n\n263\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.481\nIt gives us access to things\nlike networking communications,\n\n264\n00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:59.201\noperating systems, and even servers if we\nwant virtual servers, virtual machines.\n\n265\n00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.824\nWell, here's the thing,\nBlack Friday comes out.\n\n266\n00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:08.024\nIf you're here in the States, you know\nthat during Thanksgiving season, right,\n\n267\n00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:10.426\nwe have what's known as Black Friday,\nright?\n\n268\n00:13:10.426 --> 00:13:13.648\nAnd you're an online distributor,\nright, of some kind of product,\n\n269\n00:13:13.648 --> 00:13:15.950\nall right, maybe multiple products.\n\n270\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.310\nBlack Friday comes out and\nyour company exponentially grows and\n\n271\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.820\nyou now need, Dan says,\nI need 100 more desktops.\n\n272\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.620\nI need 100 more accounts created.\n\n273\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Servers, right?\n\n274\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.202\n&gt;&gt; Servers.\n&gt;&gt; Just to handle the load, and\n\n275\n00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:31.440\nthose things are not cheap.\n\n276\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.310\nHave you ever specced out a server?\n\n277\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.170\nThey cost a little bit of\nthe ching-ching right here.\n\n278\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.779\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\nlet's think about it this way too, Dan.\n\n279\n00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:42.010\nThey also cost a lot of money to install\nand get into your server closet, right?\n\n280\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.710\nThat is time-consuming.\n\n281\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.590\n&gt;&gt; And then what happens\nwhen Black Friday's over?\n\n282\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.720\nWhat do I do with that hardware that I\nhave now purchased that is sitting in\n\n283\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.670\na rack that I had to pay to get in there?\n\n284\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.077\nIt's just gonna sit there\nuntil next Black Friday?\n\n285\n00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:52.598\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n286\n00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.336\nhopefully that our business\ndid really well and\n\n287\n00:13:55.336 --> 00:14:00.455\njust our standard daily business jumps\nup to where I utilize those resources.\n\n288\n00:14:00.455 --> 00:14:01.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would be nice,\n\n289\n00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:03.155\nbut probably not gonna happen.\n\n290\n00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:06.095\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it comes into the whole\nROI thing, return on investment.\n\n291\n00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.832\nIt usually takes a company a minimum of\nthree, as well as up to five years to\n\n292\n00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:12.909\nhave a return on investment\nwhere they've actually paid for\n\n293\n00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:15.650\na product and\nit's paying them to use it now, right?\n\n294\n00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.421\nSo the on demand access is the fact that\nDan could call me up and say, hey, Wes.\n\n295\n00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:20.840\nI need ten more servers.\n\n296\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.218\nI need 100 more user accounts.\n\n297\n00:14:22.218 --> 00:14:27.149\nAnd I need 100 more desktops with 100\nmore instances of Office 365, right?\n\n298\n00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:30.262\nWell, don't think that it's\nnot gonna cost you, right?\n\n299\n00:14:30.262 --> 00:14:35.030\nBut your return on investment is also\nwhat we call elasticity too, right?\n\n300\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.610\nI want you to think of elastic, right?\n\n301\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.160\nA rubber band, I could stretch it out and\nthen when I let it go, yes,\n\n302\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.790\nI snap myself, it hurts.\n\n303\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.460\nBut it also goes back\nto the original size.\n\n304\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.610\n&gt;&gt; I've actually got a great analogy for\nelasticity.\n\n305\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.860\nThink of it as the stretchy pants for\nThanksgiving.\n\n306\n00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:56.048\nNormally, I don't need the waistline\nof a 48 waistline, right?\n\n307\n00:14:56.048 --> 00:14:58.296\nNormally I'm typically a 38, yeah.\n\n308\n00:14:58.296 --> 00:15:00.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n309\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.100\nBut when Thanksgiving comes,\nI need more room in the britches, right?\n\n310\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.170\nBecause I'm gonna eat a lot of food, so\nthey're gonna stretch out allowing me to\n\n311\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.740\nexpand my capabilities of my\npants to accommodate the need.\n\n312\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.513\nSame thing with elasticity\ninside of cloud technologies.\n\n313\n00:15:17.513 --> 00:15:18.702\nI'm expanding rapidly.\n\n314\n00:15:18.702 --> 00:15:22.600\n[LAUGH] I need more room to move,\ntherefore the servers ramp up and\n\n315\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.631\nI can do all this automatically.\n\n316\n00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:25.391\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n317\n00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:30.509\nI just set and say, if I need more\nresources, add the up to x amounts, right?\n\n318\n00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:34.430\nBecause obviously, money's going to\nbe [LAUGH] a factor in those things.\n\n319\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.100\nBut the same idea,\nas my pants need to grow,\n\n320\n00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.150\nas my server farm needs to grow,\nthe demand is there, it grows as needed.\n\n321\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.568\nWhen the demand goes away,\nwell, guess what?\n\n322\n00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.880\nIt shrinks back down.\n\n323\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm over here dying because I'm like,\nthat is a great analogy.\n\n324\n00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.605\nI'm over here cracking up, but\nthat's absolutely correct, right?\n\n325\n00:15:51.605 --> 00:15:53.940\nWhen we need it,\nwe can expand our network.\n\n326\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.076\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We could expand those resources.\n\n327\n00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.455\n&gt;&gt; You'll never think of\nelasticity the same again.\n\n328\n00:15:57.455 --> 00:15:59.408\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll never think of elasticity\n\n329\n00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:00.171\nthe same way again.\n\n330\n00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:00.781\nThat's right.\n\n331\n00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:02.482\nBut you guys can relate to that, right?\n\n332\n00:16:02.482 --> 00:16:05.890\nI need it now so I expand out.\n\n333\n00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.670\nI don't need it tomorrow, I can reduce it.\n\n334\n00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.910\nAnd guess what?\n\n335\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:15.000\nThe price point, the return on investment,\nI get it almost immediately, right?\n\n336\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.480\nImmediately because guess what?\n\n337\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.880\nI no longer have to pay for those servers.\n\n338\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.310\nAll right, now I'm not saying\nfire your hundred employees but\n\n339\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.190\nI don't those employees,\nmaybe they were temps, right?\n\n340\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.320\nI don't need them now cuz\nthe demand's no longer there, right.\n\n341\n00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.350\nSo that's the great thing about\nthe elasticity, rapid elasticity.\n\n342\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.197\nMore so than anything else right?\n\n343\n00:16:34.197 --> 00:16:35.110\nWhat else do we have?\n\n344\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.950\nSo if our infrastructure as a service\nreally is the computational power.\n\n345\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.370\nMemory, storage, network communications,\noperating systems that you need to run.\n\n346\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.100\nI said servers because, again, remember a\nserver is a combination of those physical\n\n347\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.340\nresources and the operating system, pretty\nmuch rolled into one package, right?\n\n348\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.510\nWell, the next one is going\nto be platform as a service.\n\n349\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.800\nNow this is the one,\nif you're first getting into A+,\n\n350\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.480\nthat probably most of you\nwill relate to the least.\n\n351\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.400\nWhy?\n\n352\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.360\nNow if you're coming from\na developer environment,\n\n353\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.860\nyou're gonna relate to this\none probably the most, right?\n\n354\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.500\nImagine I need to work with some\nkind of software, all right?\n\n355\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.490\nWe're doing some kind of\nsoftware development.\n\n356\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.860\nAll right, well in order to have\nthat development environment.\n\n357\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.690\nAll right, you're gonna need servers.\n\n358\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.290\nWell, I've got that with\nInfrastructure as a Service.\n\n359\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.620\nBut you're also gonna need a run time\nenvironment, and what I mean by a run\n\n360\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.160\ntime environment is an application\nworks within a set type of environment.\n\n361\n00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.236\nSo for instance a lot of times in\nthe Windows environment, right,\n\n362\n00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:35.080\nwe do .NET framework.\n\n363\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.620\nWell, guess what?\n\n364\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.120\nWe have to set all that up.\n\n365\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.920\nWe have to set up that operating system.\n\n366\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.050\nWe have to set up that\nrun time environment,\n\n367\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.350\nso that my programs can\nbe tested within it.\n\n368\n00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:49.820\nWell guess what, that's where\nplatform as a service comes in,\n\n369\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.600\nbecause what it does is when you combined\nit with things like infrastructure as\n\n370\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.380\na service, you get that run time and\nexecution environment.\n\n371\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.080\nYou get the infrastructure, if you will,\n\n372\n00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.910\nto support the computational power of\nthe applications that you're testing.\n\n373\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.310\nRight?\nDevelopment teams if you will,\n\n374\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.010\nthat can work with all of\nthe common program languages.\n\n375\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.934\nNow you don't have to understand anything\nabout programming cuz I could spell C++\n\n376\n00:18:11.934 --> 00:18:12.771\non a good day.\n\n377\n00:18:12.771 --> 00:18:15.747\nYou don't have to understand anything\nabout development or programming, right?\n\n378\n00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:17.815\nIf you wanna learn a little\nbit more about development,\n\n379\n00:18:17.815 --> 00:18:19.181\ncheck out our development courses.\n\n380\n00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.430\nWe've got DevProTV and\n\n381\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.733\nif you wanna learn a foreign language-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:24.770\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be your platform for sure.\n\n383\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.010\nAll right, and I joke around about it, but\n\n384\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.520\nI'm serious too because I\ndon't understand programming.\n\n385\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.500\nAnd with platform as a service\nI don't need to understand it.\n\n386\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.340\nAs an administrator a development\nperson can come to me and\n\n387\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.570\nsay this is what I need.\n\n388\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.550\nAnd I can say okay I can\nspin up an instance and\n\n389\n00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.510\nI can pull down this\nmodularly if you will.\n\n390\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.440\nAnd I can bring up that environment for\nyou, and now you can work with it.\n\n391\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.940\n&gt;&gt; Even further than that if you have\na few developers with any kinda wits about\n\n392\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.400\nthem which they are usually\npretty smart people.\n\n393\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.110\nI can even remove myself from the equation\naltogether as a systems administrator.\n\n394\n00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.750\nWhereas, before, in a traditional model,\nthey need a development environment.\n\n395\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.310\nWe wanna test an application,\nwe wanna write it in this.\n\n396\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.450\nI gotta have a Windows 2000 something or\nother server, right?\n\n397\n00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.140\nI've gotta have this development\nplatform to run on that,\n\n398\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.640\nbecause that's what we're writing it in.\n\n399\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.470\nAnd I need network connectivity to it, I\nneed access from here, access from there.\n\n400\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.704\nI'm doing a lot of work as an admin\nof things I'm never gonna touch and\n\n401\n00:19:18.704 --> 00:19:22.370\nthen when it comes time for\nupdates I've got to do all that.\n\n402\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.608\nI'm basically supporting my developers so\nthey can test things and\n\n403\n00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:28.920\nthat takes a lot of time,\nit takes a lot of effort.\n\n404\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.730\nNow like Wes said, we can go to this\npast environment and say, okay,\n\n405\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:37.180\nwell I can just go into AWS or\nWindows Azure and fire that up.\n\n406\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.954\nThere you go.\nPlatform as a service, login,\n\n407\n00:19:38.954 --> 00:19:41.090\nhere's your credentials,\ngo crazy and enjoy.\n\n408\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.170\nBut I can take it one step further and\ngo, you know what?\n\n409\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.575\nI can give you a login with\nthe ability to fire it up yourself,\n\n410\n00:19:47.575 --> 00:19:51.110\ncuz all your doing is going\nI need Windows server\n\n411\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.000\nwith this environment already built in\nclick, click, click your way through.\n\n412\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.410\nAnd it's done.\nThey can do that themselves.\n\n413\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.610\nThey can follow a wizard that allows\nthem to develop that themselves.\n\n414\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.905\nIt's very simple and different.\n\n415\n00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:05.230\nI'm now out of the loop completely.\n\n416\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.270\nAll the updates are being\ndone by our cloud provider.\n\n417\n00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.230\nAll the hardware redundancy is\nbeing done by the cloud provider.\n\n418\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.930\nI don't even need to get involved\nother than making sure they don't go\n\n419\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.580\ncrazy with spending.\n\n420\n00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:21.360\nRight, and\nI can even input spending caps inside of\n\n421\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.570\nthe environment as an administrator of\nthe cloud service that we've rented out.\n\n422\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.210\nIt's really nice.\n\n423\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.186\n&gt;&gt; And you know what, again to continue\non with that line of thinking,\n\n424\n00:20:30.186 --> 00:20:32.790\nthat's exactly what we do here at ITProTV.\n\n425\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:38.330\nBy far, one of our best,\nmost knowledgeable subject matter experts.\n\n426\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.510\nProbably more so than anybody\nthan I've seen ever is Don Pezet.\n\n427\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.080\nAnd he fully understands\nthe cloud platforms that we use.\n\n428\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.460\nInside and out.\n\n429\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.790\nAnd he does a lot of things around here.\n\n430\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.160\nAnd one of the things that you've\nprobably seen is that he also does shows.\n\n431\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.390\nWell he's actually removed himself a lot\nfrom that development environment.\n\n432\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.980\nAnd our dev team and our lead developer\ndoes just what Dan's talking about.\n\n433\n00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.260\nBrings down that environment,\nspins it up, and\n\n434\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.000\nthen hands it out to the rest of the dev\nteam, and then they collaborate together.\n\n435\n00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.810\nAnd then when it's no longer\nneeded Its gone, right.\n\n436\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.750\nAnd then we can do things that you\ndon't have to worry about here,\n\n437\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.820\nthey call it charge back metering,\nit's another cloud based technology,\n\n438\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.380\nit goes beyond this exam.\n\n439\n00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.220\nBut charge back metering is just,\nessentially if I need to find out\n\n440\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.450\nwhich departments are using what\nwithin our cloud based environment,\n\n441\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.770\nI need to know which manager and\nwhich team to charge it to, right?\n\n442\n00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:36.380\nSo it helps us also to do with basically\nresource and monetary allocation, right?\n\n443\n00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.180\nIt's accountability.\n\n444\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.237\nSo it's a great thing to have.\n\n445\n00:21:39.237 --> 00:21:43.309\nNow, those are a little bit about the\ndifferent infrastructures that we have,\n\n446\n00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:47.640\nand we definitely want you guys to be\naware of them out there, all right?\n\n447\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.910\nNow the next thing I want to mention just\na little bit are some of the different\n\n448\n00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.730\ncloud, we talked about the cloud\nsolutions that you have.\n\n449\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.220\nServices they call it,\n\n450\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.220\nwe call them services solutions a lot of\ntimes they're gonna be interchangeable.\n\n451\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.320\nBut there are different models you\nneed to be aware of too, all right.\n\n452\n00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.090\nAnd in the exam objectives they call out\npublic, private, hybrid and community.\n\n453\n00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:12.089\nGoodness, so\nwhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n454\n00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:16.068\nWell, when we say public cloud,\nwhat we're talking about is,\n\n455\n00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:21.169\nyou go to somebody like AWS, somebody like\nDan mentioned, a couple of them here.\n\n456\n00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:22.721\nAWS, Amazon Web Services,\n\n457\n00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:27.220\neven though they don't like to be\ncalled Amazon Web Services, AWS.\n\n458\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.890\nWIndows Azure, Microsoft's solution.\n\n459\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.630\nThese are gigantic solutions.\n\n460\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.420\nAnd in fact,\nto give some credit to our chat room.\n\n461\n00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.330\nIn fact one of our faithful\nmembers out there that's in\n\n462\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.710\nthe chat room almost every day,\nmentions this.\n\n463\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.520\nSays that the software as a service that\nwe use today, has a massive redundancy.\n\n464\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.670\nSo much so, that we're talking about\nmultiple geographical locations.\n\n465\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.245\nAnd I mean continental,\nwe're talking about not just regions,\n\n466\n00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:57.320\nwe're talking about entire continents,\nall right?\n\n467\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:03.195\nAnd a public resource like that, a public\ncloud major using their infrastructure,\n\n468\n00:23:03.195 --> 00:23:06.268\nsolely their infrastructure, all right?\n\n469\n00:23:06.268 --> 00:23:07.729\nWhat's a private cloud?\n\n470\n00:23:07.729 --> 00:23:09.760\nNow a private cloud's a little\nbit different, all right.\n\n471\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.810\nLet me give you kind of\nan example here of a private.\n\n472\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.800\nThis is actually a hybrid\nmodel that I've got.\n\n473\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.700\nBut we'll go ahead and\ntalk about it in both contexts.\n\n474\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.100\nSo the diagram that I have here is\nactually what's known as a hybrid model.\n\n475\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.850\nAnd the reason I say that is because\nwe're using some private cloud.\n\n476\n00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.113\nIf we focus in on this main office here,\nand\n\n477\n00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:30.201\nif I'm maintaining and\nmanaging, managetaining?\n\n478\n00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:33.077\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maintaining all of the resources\n\n479\n00:23:33.077 --> 00:23:39.780\nmyself, and they're my servers, my data\ncenters, my connections, guess what?\n\n480\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.590\nThat's called a private cloud.\n\n481\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.890\nNow, that's very, very expensive.\n\n482\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.415\nBut it does give me the ability to\nhave multiple geographical locations\n\n483\n00:23:47.415 --> 00:23:50.293\nthat can communicate with my\nown internal resources, and\n\n484\n00:23:50.293 --> 00:23:52.602\nI don't have to share\nthem with anybody else.\n\n485\n00:23:52.602 --> 00:23:54.671\nNow, it is very expensive,\n\n486\n00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:59.342\nyou have to have a lot of money\nto do something like this, right?\n\n487\n00:23:59.342 --> 00:24:01.344\nSome companies might\nbe able to justify it.\n\n488\n00:24:01.344 --> 00:24:05.380\nWhen security, which security isn't so\nmuch an issue anymore, it was for a while.\n\n489\n00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.340\nSome people would be like, well, we don't\nknow about the whole security thing.\n\n490\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:08.880\nWith the cloud,\n\n491\n00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.500\nthere's certain information that I just\ncan't have in the cloud because I don't\n\n492\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.750\nknow if it meets compliance standards.\n\n493\n00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.530\nThat's long been not an issue.\n\n494\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.540\nIn fact, you can go to AWS.\n\n495\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.180\nYou can go to the Azure websites.\n\n496\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.330\nAnd they have more documentation than\nyou ever wanna read in your life on\n\n497\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.240\nthe different security\nstandards that they follow.\n\n498\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.141\nBut that was in the earlier days.\n\n499\n00:24:28.141 --> 00:24:32.680\nThat was definitely a concern,\nthat's private cloud.\n\n500\n00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.629\nThen you have the hybrid cloud.\n\n501\n00:24:33.629 --> 00:24:35.285\nAnd that's actually what this is.\n\n502\n00:24:35.285 --> 00:24:38.470\nThis is a hybrid cloud, and why is that?\n\n503\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:43.770\nWell, I have some resources on site.\n\n504\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.550\nSo I can manage those, maintain them.\n\n505\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.140\nThose are private,\nsome kind of private cloud.\n\n506\n00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.290\nI've got a main office.\n\n507\n00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.550\nAnd the main office allows\nall these connections.\n\n508\n00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.280\nEven though it's cloud based to us,\nit's because I'm connecting to different\n\n509\n00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.970\nlocations, regardless of where I'm at,\ngeographically distributed.\n\n510\n00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.540\nBut then we have some sites that,\n\n511\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.690\nwell, they just don't have\nany on-site resources.\n\n512\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.740\nI don't have any on-site,\nif you will, servers.\n\n513\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.607\nI might have just a network switch, where\nwe can connect outbound to the Internet.\n\n514\n00:25:11.607 --> 00:25:13.960\nBut for the most part,\nI don't have on-site resources.\n\n515\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.549\nSo what do we use?\n\n516\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.570\nWe use part of the public cloud as well.\n\n517\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.200\nSo public and\nprivate is your hybrid cloud.\n\n518\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.759\nNow the other one that they also call out\nis what's known as a community cloud.\n\n519\n00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:28.198\nAnd I'm gonna change this\npretty much all around.\n\n520\n00:25:28.198 --> 00:25:32.242\nI want you to take something\nlike a doctor's office.\n\n521\n00:25:32.242 --> 00:25:36.230\nSo we'll say DR1 for a doctor's office.\n\n522\n00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.560\nBut then we also have insurance companies.\n\n523\n00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.374\nSo we'll just say, Insurance,\n\n524\n00:25:45.374 --> 00:25:48.470\nI always get that wrong, Insurance 1.\n\n525\n00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.490\nNow a community is where\ntypically you have essentially\n\n526\n00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:59.470\na private cloud that is being utilized\nby more than one organization.\n\n527\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.300\nAnd you might say, well,\nhow is that beneficial?\n\n528\n00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.090\nWell, one of the examples I'd give is\nI want you to take a doctor's office.\n\n529\n00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.110\nIf a doctor's office and\nan insurance company\n\n530\n00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.520\nneed to make things like claims\nto Medicare and stuff like that.\n\n531\n00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.700\nChances are they probably need\naccess to the same information.\n\n532\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.330\nA doctor's and insurance office.\n\n533\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.860\nSo you can see something like that,\nwhere they have a community cloud.\n\n534\n00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.539\nThey have a mutual benefit.\n\n535\n00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:28.690\nAnd the benefit is obviously servicing\nthe customers that they're supporting.\n\n536\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.490\nSo the doctor's office has access to\ncertain HIPAA compliant records, where?\n\n537\n00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.505\nWell, guess what?\n\n538\n00:26:33.505 --> 00:26:36.340\nIt's private healthcare information,\nprivate health information,\n\n539\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.190\nPHI as it's called.\n\n540\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.170\nThe insurance company needs access\nto that kind of information as well.\n\n541\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.130\nSo you can have a community cloud,\nwhere the goal is\n\n542\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.830\nsimilar on both sides of their businesses.\n\n543\n00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.475\nSo they share resources.\n\n544\n00:26:52.475 --> 00:26:56.120\nNow whether there's commonality in that,\nI'm not really sure.\n\n545\n00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.367\nI don't have any statistics on it.\n\n546\n00:26:57.367 --> 00:27:03.220\nBut I do know that one of the most common\nones is a public only and a hybrid model.\n\n547\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.615\nThose are two of the most common.\n\n548\n00:27:04.615 --> 00:27:07.860\nIt is the fact that\neverything's in the cloud.\n\n549\n00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.780\nOr portions are on-premise and\nportions are in the cloud as well,\n\n550\n00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.626\nthe hybrid model.\n\n551\n00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:15.323\nSo those are a few different models\nthat we want you to be aware of.\n\n552\n00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:18.970\nAgain, remember public,\nprivate, hybrid and community.\n\n553\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.568\nAgain, remember with community,\nit gets a little confusing sometimes.\n\n554\n00:27:21.568 --> 00:27:23.808\nCuz you might say\ncommunity as a hybrid and\n\n555\n00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:26.117\nnot necessarily does it have to be hybrid.\n\n556\n00:27:26.117 --> 00:27:28.161\nEverything can be in the cloud.\n\n557\n00:27:28.161 --> 00:27:30.180\nEverything can be in\nthe cloud in a community.\n\n558\n00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.614\nIt just means you have\nmore than one organization\n\n559\n00:27:33.614 --> 00:27:36.810\naccessing the same cloud resources.\n\n560\n00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.040\nIf Dan has company one, well,\nget community out of it.\n\n561\n00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.041\nDan's got company one,\nI've got company two.\n\n562\n00:27:43.041 --> 00:27:48.870\nWe can both go to AWS and\nget our own cloud based services.\n\n563\n00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.020\nBut they're isolated from each other.\n\n564\n00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.750\nDan's information on AWS isn't allowed to\nsee mine, and I'm not allowed to see his.\n\n565\n00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.590\nWe're completely two separate customers.\n\n566\n00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.130\nYou don't see, that's different.\n\n567\n00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.580\nThat's one of the benefits, too,\nof the cloud based solution, too,\n\n568\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.220\nis that isolation between tenants.\n\n569\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.620\nThey call it tenant isolation.\n\n570\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.434\nA community, though, is where you\nhave the same cloud resources.\n\n571\n00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:15.970\nAnd two different companies\naccess those same resources.\n\n572\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.502\nSo just be careful.\n\n573\n00:28:17.502 --> 00:28:18.890\nI wanna make sure that I clarify on that.\n\n574\n00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.380\nRemember, cloud has its benefit.\n\n575\n00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.440\nIf you're a smaller company and you can't\nafford the hundreds of thousands of\n\n576\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.050\ndollars that it could cost to manage,\nmaintain, train teams to do specialized\n\n577\n00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.770\nmanagement of your\ninfrastructure on-premise.\n\n578\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:37.000\nYou can pay somebody who already has\nthe network, already has those resources,\n\n579\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.590\nhas the highly trained staff.\n\n580\n00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.815\nThey can do it for you, and\nyou can just pay them a service.\n\n581\n00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:43.760\nSo keep in mind, cloud is here.\n\n582\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.019\nCloud is where it's at.\n\n583\n00:28:45.019 --> 00:28:46.580\nCloud is here to stay.\n\n584\n00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.080\nAnd in fact,\n\n585\n00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.840\nif there's any piece of advice on any\ntechnology within the A+ series that I\n\n586\n00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.770\ncan tell you, you really should be\nstudying, it better be the cloud.\n\n587\n00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.790\nBecause the cloud isn't going away.\n\n588\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.217\nAnd it's only getting more prevalent.\n\n589\n00:28:58.217 --> 00:29:01.450\nAnd it's getting more and\nmore popular as time progresses.\n\n590\n00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, I totally agree\nwith everything you just said there.\n\n591\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.336\nCloud is definitely the present.\n\n592\n00:29:07.336 --> 00:29:09.300\nAnd it definitely will\nbe the future as well.\n\n593\n00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.416\nSo take some time.\n\n594\n00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:13.978\nUnderstand the difference of\nthe cloud types, the cloud models.\n\n595\n00:29:13.978 --> 00:29:17.180\nWhether or not it's a private,\npublic, hybrid or community.\n\n596\n00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.205\nKnow those like the back of your hand.\n\n597\n00:29:18.205 --> 00:29:22.528\nAlso know the differences between\nthings like IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS.\n\n598\n00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:26.218\nCuz they're probably gonna hit you\nwith some type of question of,\n\n599\n00:29:26.218 --> 00:29:30.555\nhere's the setup,\nwhat type of cloud model is that?\n\n600\n00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:34.490\nAnd you gotta be able to,\nthat's platform as a service, no problem.\n\n601\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.773\nClick and move on to the next one.\n\n602\n00:29:35.773 --> 00:29:37.640\nSo be familiar with those.\n\n603\n00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.790\nVery good stuff, and Wes,\nyou did a great job presenting that.\n\n604\n00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.939\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Explaining it for us,\n\n605\n00:29:41.939 --> 00:29:42.750\nwe appreciate that.\n\n606\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.148\nWe hope you guys enjoyed it out there.\n\n607\n00:29:44.148 --> 00:29:46.568\nAnd maybe even were\na little bit entertained,\n\n608\n00:29:46.568 --> 00:29:48.620\nif we could get away with that.\n\n609\n00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.464\nBut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n610\n00:29:50.464 --> 00:29:52.300\nSo we're gonna have to sign off.\n\n611\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.600\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:29:54.600 -->

00:00:17.363\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:18.813\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:22.097\nin today's episode well we're moving\non with more in our A plus series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:25.904\nThe 22902, they got too many 2s,\ntoo many 9s and\n\n10\n00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:29.876\ntoo many 0s in that thing for\nme but it is a lot of fun to say.\n\n11\n00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:34.148\nAnd joining us in the studio to help me\nfigure that out is our good friend, Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:34.824\nWes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:35.665\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:36.529\nHow is it going, today?\n\n15\n00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:37.355\n&gt;&gt; I'm over here, dying.\n\n16\n00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:38.112\nYeah, man, that's awesome.\n\n17\n00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:38.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n18\n00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:40.485\nout of like 60 episodes we've recorded.\n\n19\n00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:41.588\n&gt;&gt; I know, I finally get it wrong.\n\n20\n00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:44.425\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, I think you've only\nmissed the curve ball maybe once or twice.\n\n21\n00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:48.613\n&gt;&gt; I've been wanting to call that\nthing the 920 for like two weeks now.\n\n22\n00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:49.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why.\n\n23\n00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:51.112\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n24\n00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:53.673\nAnd as you can see, that's right,\nwe're back in A+, right?\n\n25\n00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:55.152\nIt just happens to be the 902.\n\n26\n00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:58.471\nAnd we are going to be looking at\nsomething that's kinda interesting.\n\n27\n00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.166\nAnd it might throw you off a little bit\nwhen we've talked about network host\n\n28\n00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:02.760\nservices.\n\n29\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.285\nDan and I were actually talking\ndiscussing this before we even started\n\n30\n00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:11.357\nbecause we've been into things\nlike system administration.\n\n31\n00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:12.431\nI can say aluminum too,\n&gt;&gt; Max Hedrum.\n\n32\n00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:13.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're rubbing off on me Dan\n\n33\n00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.632\nthat's for sure.\n\n34\n00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:15.856\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Aluminimum.\n\n35\n00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:20.644\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you might be looking at this episode\n\n36\n00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:23.606\ntitle and\nsaying what the heck are we talking about?\n\n37\n00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:27.224\nAnd the reason I say that is because in\nsystems administration, in networking, we\n\n38\n00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:30.758\ntalk a lot about services that different\ncomputers provide out in our networks.\n\n39\n00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.715\nAnd while most of your\ncomputers are network host,\n\n40\n00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.484\nwe gotta understand what a host means,\nright?\n\n41\n00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:41.125\nIn the earlier days of computing,\na host really just meant something like,\n\n42\n00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.963\nbasically a centralized mainframe, right?\n\n43\n00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:47.075\nIt hosted all the services,\nprovided all the resources,\n\n44\n00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:51.282\nall the storage, all the processing power\nthat you can have on your networks.\n\n45\n00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:53.876\nWell, that really isn't\nthe case any more today.\n\n46\n00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:56.938\nWhen we We talk about generically\nTCPIP based networks,\n\n47\n00:01:56.938 --> 00:02:00.575\na host is really nothing more than\nany self-sufficient computer,\n\n48\n00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.936\noperating system device\nthat can manage and\n\n49\n00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:07.122\nmaintain its own networking communications\nout there in the network today.\n\n50\n00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.116\nSo when we talk about network host\nservices what are we talking about?\n\n51\n00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:13.145\nAll right, I want you to think\nof them about the services and\n\n52\n00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:17.344\nresources that are provided to other\ncomputers out there on the network, right?\n\n53\n00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:22.041\nIn past episodes we've talked a little bit\nabout our network architectures, right?\n\n54\n00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.115\nNetwork technologies.\n\n55\n00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:25.560\nWe've talked about what a client is.\n\n56\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.336\nWe've talked about what a server is.\n\n57\n00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:29.169\nWe've talked about peer to\npeer environments, right?\n\n58\n00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.828\nSo let's go ahead, before we dive into\nthe different services that we have out\n\n59\n00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:38.577\nthere on our networks, let's talk about\nthe networking models, if you will.\n\n60\n00:02:38.577 --> 00:02:42.065\nRemember that we have a completely\ndecentralized networking model, and\n\n61\n00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:44.044\nthat's a peer-to-peer environment.\n\n62\n00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:47.750\nThey call it a peer to peer environment\nbecause each one of the operating\n\n63\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.306\nsystems or\n\n64\n00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:52.508\nthe devices that are associated with the\noperating systems out there can act like\n\n65\n00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:56.626\na client requesting a resource as well\nas providing resources on the network.\n\n66\n00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:59.411\nSo for instance, in Microsoft Workgroup,\n\n67\n00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:04.317\nthat is essentially Microsoft's\nimplementation of a peer to peer network.\n\n68\n00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:07.085\nI can have one computer that actually\nhas a printer connected to it.\n\n69\n00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:08.928\nAnd that printer, if you will,\n\n70\n00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:13.316\nis basically gonna be the printer that\neverybody else uses on that network.\n\n71\n00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:15.767\nWell, that computer is\nacting kinda like a server.\n\n72\n00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:19.341\nIt's providing a service, a print\nfunctionality for the rest of the network.\n\n73\n00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:21.326\nWhile on another computer we could have,\n\n74\n00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.488\nmaybe Dan's put about\nten hard drives in it.\n\n75\n00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:27.017\nSo we know there's a lot of storage in\nthat one computer within this peer to peer\n\n76\n00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:28.412\nenvironment, so guest what?\n\n77\n00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:32.377\nThat device is where we're gonna store\nthe majority of our business document in\n\n78\n00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:33.099\na SOHO right?\n\n79\n00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.004\nSo maybe we've got RAID array in there or\nRAID1 configurations,so we've got a little\n\n80\n00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:40.183\nbit of fall tolerance redundancy so\nthat if one of the hard drives fail.\n\n81\n00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:44.829\nSo you can see that those two\ncomputers are providing resources.\n\n82\n00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.519\nBut when the computer that is actually\nin that peer to peer network that is\n\n83\n00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.284\nproviding the storage for our files\nneeds to send something to a printer.\n\n84\n00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:54.380\nWell now, it's no longer\nacting like a server, right?\n\n85\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.648\nIt's gonna request a resource that's\nprovided by the other computer.\n\n86\n00:03:58.648 --> 00:04:00.640\nSo that's why they call them peers, right?\n\n87\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.171\nAnd peers are in relation to\nanother type of topology or\n\n88\n00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:07.028\narchitecture called Client Server Model.\n\n89\n00:04:07.028 --> 00:04:10.034\nAnd Client Server Models where we get\ninto our corporate environments, right?\n\n90\n00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:14.053\nClient Server Models where we get\ncentralized administration rather than in\n\n91\n00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.103\na work group we call it decentralized.\n\n92\n00:04:16.103 --> 00:04:19.508\nCuz you have to go from computer to\ncomputer to computer managing user\n\n93\n00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:23.330\naccounts and resources, and every\ncomputer controls it's own resources.\n\n94\n00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.180\nUser accounts and in the Client Server\nModel we have centralized administration,\n\n95\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.986\ncuz we can use things like\nauthentication servers, right?\n\n96\n00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:33.078\nAnd when we use an authentication server\nessentially what we have is a single\n\n97\n00:04:33.078 --> 00:04:34.784\nserver out there that's on the network.\n\n98\n00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:39.069\nAnd what it does is it really provides\nthe authentication resource for\n\n99\n00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.074\nall the other machines that are out\nthere on the network, right?\n\n100\n00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:46.308\nSo for instance, we could have\nlike an Active Directory domain.\n\n101\n00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:48.708\nIf we talked about\nan Active Directory domain,\n\n102\n00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:52.188\nthen essentially what we mean here\nis that we have one single device,\n\n103\n00:04:52.188 --> 00:04:54.952\none single computer that's\nout there on the network.\n\n104\n00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:58.553\nThat when somebody logs in,\nin fact, let me show you here,\n\n105\n00:04:58.553 --> 00:05:00.291\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n106\n00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.213\nSo when somebody logs into the network,\nright?\n\n107\n00:05:02.213 --> 00:05:06.054\nIt rather than that being checked on\nthe local machine, that authentication,\n\n108\n00:05:06.054 --> 00:05:09.164\nit actually sends it out over\nthere across the network, right?\n\n109\n00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:13.016\nAnd the user database is\nstored on the server, right?\n\n110\n00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:17.153\nSo now we're talking, when we talk about\nClient Server Model, what you have,\n\n111\n00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:18.772\nyou have clients, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:22.932\nThat are, you could do most of your\nday to day functionality, right?\n\n113\n00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:26.876\nBut they do require a certain amount of\nresources or services that are provided by\n\n114\n00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:30.067\nother computers out there and\nthat's where the server comes in.\n\n115\n00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:31.906\nKeep in mind in this case the server,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:31.906 --> 00:05:35.214\nIs denoted by the role or\nthe service that it's providing.\n\n117\n00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:38.664\nIn this case it happens to be\nan authentication server which means when\n\n118\n00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:40.952\nthe client,\nyou log onto the client, right?\n\n119\n00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:43.492\nDan or I,\nwe log into our local computer here.\n\n120\n00:05:43.492 --> 00:05:47.291\nWell, it really isn't the computer that\nwe're logging into that is providing\n\n121\n00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.375\nthe authentication.\n\n122\n00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.884\nWhat it's doing is it's\ncalling out to the network,\n\n123\n00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.189\nagain a client requesting\nresources out there.\n\n124\n00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.386\nSaying, hey,\nsomebody out there on the network?\n\n125\n00:05:56.386 --> 00:06:00.084\nDo you have a database that has Dan and\nmy username and\n\n126\n00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:03.531\npasswords stored in it,\nbecause we need to get,\n\n127\n00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:08.176\nI need to see if I grant access to\nthis device base on that service.\n\n128\n00:06:08.176 --> 00:06:12.251\nSo again keep in mind that Client\nServer Model means the client request\n\n129\n00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:15.371\nthe resources and\nthe server provide the resources.\n\n130\n00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:18.414\nSo, when we talk about network host,\nkinda back to the original pointer.\n\n131\n00:06:18.414 --> 00:06:20.599\nWhen we talk about network host service.\n\n132\n00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.389\nAll right, I want you to think about\nservices that we're gonna talk about,\n\n133\n00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.885\nit's more about the servers providing\na service, providing a role,\n\n134\n00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:32.233\na functionality that's needed, typically\nin things like corporate environments.\n\n135\n00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:35.919\nNow it doesn't have to be a corporate\nenvironment cuz you could have things like\n\n136\n00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.128\nmedia servers out there\non a SOHO environment.\n\n137\n00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.954\nBut again due to sometime, or\n\n138\n00:06:39.954 --> 00:06:43.905\nyou could even have a local web\nserver on the local environment.\n\n139\n00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:44.936\nBut either way,\n\n140\n00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:49.508\nkeep in mind that we typically find\nthese in an enterprise level network.\n\n141\n00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:53.526\nSo in this case, an authentication server\nessentially has a database, right?\n\n142\n00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:56.175\nJust a little storage on the hard drive,\nright?\n\n143\n00:06:56.175 --> 00:07:01.423\nAnd it contains all of the user accounts\nfor every user within the network.\n\n144\n00:07:01.423 --> 00:07:05.658\nAnd the good thing about this is,\nwhen we say centralized management,\n\n145\n00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:10.115\nit means that if we have multiple clients\nout there on this type of network.\n\n146\n00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:12.578\nThen a user should, in theory,\n\n147\n00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:16.691\nbe able to log into any one\nof those client computers.\n\n148\n00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:20.580\nBecause, since the client computer is\njust gonna hand off the authentication to\n\n149\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.954\na server that's providing that service,\nwe don't need to manage and\n\n150\n00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:27.060\nmaintain it decentralized like we\nwould in a peer to peer group.\n\n151\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.233\nSo hence a little bit about\nyour authentication server.\n\n152\n00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.833\nAnd a little bit about where we\nare going when we say services that\n\n153\n00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:33.712\nare being provided.\n\n154\n00:07:33.712 --> 00:07:37.779\nI want you to think of the service is\nthe role or functionality that is being\n\n155\n00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:42.124\nperformed by something that's really\nnothing more than a computer, right?\n\n156\n00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:45.958\nRemember, a computer is typically defined\nby the operating system that is running\n\n157\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.985\non it, and the functionality that\nit plays within your network.\n\n158\n00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:52.761\nNow that's one of the major servers\nthat we have is an authentication server\n\n159\n00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:54.713\nproviding authentication services.\n\n160\n00:07:54.713 --> 00:07:57.927\nBut we also have things like\nDNS services that are needed or\n\n161\n00:07:57.927 --> 00:07:59.771\nrequired to do name resolution.\n\n162\n00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.054\nWe've talked pretty extensively about\nthe DNS service in another episode.\n\n163\n00:08:03.054 --> 00:08:05.838\nI believe it was the 901 episode where\nwe had to go through the protocols.\n\n164\n00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:08.744\nYou gotta understand how the networks\nwere communicating with one another.\n\n165\n00:08:08.744 --> 00:08:14.383\nWell, remember one of the two major\nservices that are out there your network,\n\n166\n00:08:14.383 --> 00:08:15.670\nare DNS and DHCP.\n\n167\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.483\nAnd what [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So its completely important.\n\n168\n00:08:17.483 --> 00:08:18.638\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n169\n00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:19.560\n[CROSSTALK] We're never\ngonna need it at all.\n\n170\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n171\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.750\nBecause think about it, you don't really\nknow a lot of the IP addresses to\n\n172\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.290\nthe computers that you\nare trying to communicate with.\n\n173\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.450\nIn fact, let's take\nthe authentication server, in fact,\n\n174\n00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.350\nlet me just back step a little bit here,\nright?\n\n175\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.310\nAn authentication server, it really a lot\nof times is not a client reaching out to\n\n176\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.260\nthe network and saying hey,\nwho's got 10.10.10.100?\n\n177\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.090\nIt doesn't say that at all.\n\n178\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.260\nIn fact,\nit says I need a service out here.\n\n179\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.663\nI need an authentication service in\nthis case I need an ELD up server,right?\n\n180\n00:08:48.663 --> 00:08:54.615\nWell, to be able to find that service\nthat's being provided, guess what it does?\n\n181\n00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:55.276\nIt relies with DNS.\n\n182\n00:08:55.276 --> 00:09:00.243\nFirst, it talks to another server and\nsay hey, we got a name here,\n\n183\n00:09:00.243 --> 00:09:03.730\ncuz all I have is a name and\nI need an IP address.\n\n184\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.090\nAnd in this network protocol stack\nthat we have, it's telling me,\n\n185\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.010\naccording to the rules of TCP/IP,\n\n186\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.690\nI gotta have some kind of number to\ntalk to this authentication server.\n\n187\n00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.730\nSo you can start to see that these\nServices that we have out there and again,\n\n188\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.050\nthey call it network host services.\n\n189\n00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.350\nThese roles, these functionalities that\nare out there allow your computers,\n\n190\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.470\nif you will,\nto communicate between one another.\n\n191\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.571\nDNS keep in mind takes names and\nit resolves them to IP addresses.\n\n192\n00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.766\nIt's why we can type in to\nthings our web browsers, right?\n\n193\n00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:41.653\nWe type into our web browsers,\nwww.google.com, www.yourcompany.com and\n\n194\n00:09:41.653 --> 00:09:46.622\nwe could go to the web server and\nwe can actually find them.\n\n195\n00:09:46.622 --> 00:09:50.330\nWhich brings me, well,\nto the web server, right?\n\n196\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.510\nSo what is a web server doing for us?\n\n197\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:57.270\nWell, I want you to think about\na language called HTML, right?\n\n198\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.770\nThat's the HyperText Markup Language,\nright?\n\n199\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:05.050\nHyperText Markup Language is essentially\nthe language that a web page\n\n200\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.940\nis written in.\n\n201\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.970\nAnd what we use a web server for, right?\n\n202\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.300\nWell, it's a combination of things, right?\n\n203\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.890\nWe have a web application and\nthen we have a web application server.\n\n204\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.340\nSo in this case, you're probably familiar\nwith a lot of the different web browsers\n\n205\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.910\nwe have,\nwhich is your web application, right?\n\n206\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.440\nAnd the web application actually is\nthe software that acts like a client.\n\n207\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.880\nAnd what happens is when\nyou browse with DNS,\n\n208\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.542\nit renders the IP address or resolves,\nif you will, that name to that IP address.\n\n209\n00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:35.010\nNow you're web application, or\n\n210\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.550\nyour browser says, now I know where\nthe IP address is of this web server.\n\n211\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.040\nLet me go ahead and\nI'm gonna reach out across the network.\n\n212\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.910\nYou can start to see how they're\nall kinda intertwined here, right?\n\n213\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.086\nI can reach out to the web server and what\nyou're actually gonna do, and I say you\n\n214\n00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:50.184\nguys, keep in mind it's the software\nin the background that's doing this.\n\n215\n00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:54.532\nIs the web browser is saying,\nhey, I need that webpage.\n\n216\n00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.740\nDo you have that webpage, right?\n\n217\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.940\nAnd over something known as HTTP is the\ncommunication protocol that's happening,\n\n218\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.070\nhypertext transfer protocol.\n\n219\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.430\nWe actually reach out the web server,\nand we request a resource.\n\n220\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.400\nNow as you go on in the networking and or\nnetwork plus maybe go on a security plus,\n\n221\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.080\nwhere we start doing things like\nfiring up on packet analyzer, right?\n\n222\n00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.080\nProtocol analyzers, you can actually\nsee this communication going on,\n\n223\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.340\nyou're reaching out you're saying hey,\ngive me it's actually get requests,\n\n224\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.780\nhey give me this resource, do you have it?\n\n225\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.950\nAnd in the web server,\nbased on permissions,\n\n226\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.430\nbased on your authentications, sometimes\nwe secure them, so just not everybody\n\n227\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.672\ncan communicate with the web server says,\nlet me look down at my hard drive here.\n\n228\n00:11:36.672 --> 00:11:40.520\nAll right, I see that HTML,\nthat web page that you're requesting and\n\n229\n00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.295\nit returns it back to the browser,\nand then over HTTP or HTTPS, right?\n\n230\n00:11:46.295 --> 00:11:47.865\nHypertext Transfer Protocol or\n\n231\n00:11:47.865 --> 00:11:51.270\nHypertext Transfer Protocol over\nSecure Socket Layer, right?\n\n232\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.490\nIt's gonna be HTTPS is secure.\n\n233\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.340\nIt delivers it the web browser and\n\n234\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.120\nthen the web browsers job is to\ntake the HTML and render it.\n\n235\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.020\nAnd guess what?\n\n236\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.160\nWe see the web page.\n\n237\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.070\nLot of things are going on\nin the background, right?\n\n238\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:12.080\nLot of interconnections, lot of\ncommunications between each other between\n\n239\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.540\nclient server have to happen just for your\naverage, everyday computing experience.\n\n240\n00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.660\nNow, I mentioned DHCP, all right.\n\n241\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.720\nWe've also talked about DHCP\nin other episodes here too, so\n\n242\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.770\nI'm just going to briefly kind of recap,\nright?\n\n243\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.080\nSo if we're talking about\nsomething like DNS.\n\n244\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.520\nAll right, what's happening, right?\n\n245\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.090\nDNS again, you're calling out and saying\nI got a name, you got the IP address, but\n\n246\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.860\nI can talk to this computer.\n\n247\n00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.590\nWell, DHCP remembers the dynamic\nhost configuration protocol.\n\n248\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.160\nAnd what actually happens here is your\ncomputer connects to the local network,\n\n249\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.640\nand it doesn't have an IP address.\n\n250\n00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.870\nSo what does it do?\n\n251\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.540\nIt yells out to every computer\non the network, everybody, and\n\n252\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.910\nsays, hey,\nanybody out there got an IP address?\n\n253\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.550\nI could really use one, I'd like to\ntalk on this network, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.840\nThat's called a discovery packing,\nall right?\n\n255\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.350\nSo your client is requesting a resource.\n\n256\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.560\nIn this case, it just happens to\nbe some host configuration and\n\n257\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.960\nthere's a server out there that's\nlistening, the DHCP server.\n\n258\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.230\nNow, please understand that we\nalso talking about software here.\n\n259\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:17.030\nSo, even though, as far as the diagram\ngoes, I've got this big, massive\n\n260\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:21.060\nserver here compared to this client,\nit could just be your access point.\n\n261\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.810\nIf you're on the home environment it could\njust be wireless access point that's\n\n262\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.730\nrunning the DHCP service, right?\n\n263\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.700\nThat's still gonna provide that service,\n\n264\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.560\nor it is the server,\nserving up that resources.\n\n265\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.350\nAnd then what happens after that.\n\n266\n00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.490\nWell in DHCP, keep in mind that what\nthe server's gonna do is it's gonna offer\n\n267\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.780\nsome host configuration.\n\n268\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.518\nIt's gonna say hey, I've got these\nconfigurations packaged for you.\n\n269\n00:13:42.518 --> 00:13:47.050\nIf you wanna accept it, and\nthen the next process is the request.\n\n270\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.190\nIt's my computer saying,\nyeah, that sounds good.\n\n271\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.550\nI'll go ahead and I'll take those\nconfigurations, that IP address,\n\n272\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.550\nthat subnet mask, that default gateway.\n\n273\n00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.870\nSome other options like which\nDNS server you're gonna use,\n\n274\n00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.390\nwhen you need to use name resolution?\n\n275\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.200\nSo it makes a request.\n\n276\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.080\nSo we've got discover,\noffer, and request, right?\n\n277\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.450\nLast part of this, remember the DHCP\nserver makes an acknowledgement and\n\n278\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.890\nsays okay, let me just go ahead and\nmark this down in my little database.\n\n279\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.995\nSo I know that you're gonna take this\nIP address, it's gonna be valid for\n\n280\n00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:17.850\nthis length of time, so\nthat I don't give it to somebody else.\n\n281\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.490\nSo, that's your DHCP server as well.\n\n282\n00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:21.580\nAll right, so then,\n\n283\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.800\nmoving on, we also have many different\ntypes of mail servers, right?\n\n284\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.780\nAnd when we say mail servers, what we're\ntalking about is your email servers.\n\n285\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.080\nWe've talked about some of\nthe different email protocols in other\n\n286\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.460\nepisodes, as well.\n\n287\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.920\nKeep in mind that one of the email\nprotocols that we've about is SMTP.\n\n288\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.800\nAll right, when talk about SMTP or\nthe simple mail transfer\n\n289\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.480\nprotocol what we're talking\nabout is sending information.\n\n290\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.290\nNow, this is a request if you will kinda\nwhat's gonna happen on your local network.\n\n291\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.220\nOkay, let's go back to some of\nthe other server that we talk about.\n\n292\n00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.300\nFirst you authenticated,\n\n293\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.310\nyou log in to the computer, it sends the\nauthentication out to another computer.\n\n294\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.830\nAll right, you validated it, hopefully you\ncan log in if you're like Wes, you might\n\n295\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.890\nhave to type the password a couple\ntimes before you can get that right.\n\n296\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.570\nBut, then, you need to send an email.\n\n297\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.483\nSo what happens,\nyou're gonna reach out to DNS again and\n\n298\n00:15:11.483 --> 00:15:16.634\nyou're gonna say, hey,\nI've got this name, SMTP.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n299\n00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:19.253\nWell where the heck do I find that server?\n\n300\n00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:21.949\nAnd DNS returns the name, all right?\n\n301\n00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:24.321\nAnd then if we could show\nyou a little diagram here,\n\n302\n00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:27.977\nwhat end up happening is your computer\nsends that email out to the SMTP Server.\n\n303\n00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:32.470\nRemember like we've talked about in other\nepisodes, SMTP is to forward email.\n\n304\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.110\nSo you're actually sending email.\n\n305\n00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.450\nWe got some other ones out there too.\n\n306\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:36.996\nSo I want you to,\n\n307\n00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:39.351\nwe'll just kind of go over each of\nthem cuz they do mention mail server.\n\n308\n00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:43.424\nBut a mail server is a mail server, it\nreally just depends on the direction and\n\n309\n00:15:43.424 --> 00:15:46.199\nhow you utilize it,\nprotocols differ a little bit.\n\n310\n00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:49.081\nNotice the direction of\nthe communication on this one,\n\n311\n00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.858\nwhen we talk about a POP3 server,\n\n312\n00:15:50.858 --> 00:15:55.233\nPost Office Protocol version 3, when we\nsay POP we're pulling email, all right.\n\n313\n00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:59.042\nYou have push and pull if you will,\npushing emails, forwarding,\n\n314\n00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.548\nand sending it out bound.\n\n315\n00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:03.569\nYou might see that as you go into\nnetworking and they say, hey,\n\n316\n00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:06.080\nwe've pushed a configuration\nout to the switch\".\n\n317\n00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.473\nThat means you're sending it outbound,\nright?\n\n318\n00:16:08.473 --> 00:16:11.178\nIf you're pulling something\ndown to a machine, right?\n\n319\n00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:16.520\nIn this case, we're downloading, we're\ndownloading our email to our local inbox.\n\n320\n00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.594\nNow, remember that POP3, there is\na limitation to POP3 in the fact that when\n\n321\n00:16:20.594 --> 00:16:23.327\nyou download that email it\nerases it off the server.\n\n322\n00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:26.818\nWhich means that if you go to another\ncomputer and you log in and try to find\n\n323\n00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:31.150\nyour emails, sorry, it's actually on the\nother computer that you downloaded it to.\n\n324\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.170\nWhich brings us to our last\nemail type server, mail server,\n\n325\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.130\nthat we would have and\nthat's IMAP, all right?\n\n326\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.797\nRemember IMAP, Internet Mail,\nMessage or Mail Access Protocol,\n\n327\n00:16:39.797 --> 00:16:41.968\nI've heard them called\na couple of different things.\n\n328\n00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:46.157\nInternet Mail Access Protocol or Message\nAccess Protocol is another one that allows\n\n329\n00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:48.290\nyou to manage your\nemails up on the server.\n\n330\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.445\nAll right, so\nthat's got some of the major ones,\n\n331\n00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:54.960\nanother one that we talk about in another\nepisode that I'm gonna kinda brief over.\n\n332\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.520\nIn fact, Dan reminded me that we've talked\npretty extensively in another episode when\n\n333\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.340\nwe were talking about printers.\n\n334\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.450\nIn networking devices and stuff together,\nwe've talked about a print server.\n\n335\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.120\nAll right, keep in mind that\na print server is nothing more than\n\n336\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.940\nthe software that is managing\nthe print queue, really.\n\n337\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.870\nWindows machines, they have\nthe ability to become a print server.\n\n338\n00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.514\nWe have the print management functionality\nbuilt into the administrative\n\n339\n00:17:20.514 --> 00:17:23.397\ntools within every\nclient operating system.\n\n340\n00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:27.252\nIt essentially means that Microsoft gave\nyou the ability that whether you're in\n\n341\n00:17:27.252 --> 00:17:30.482\na client-server network or\nyou're in a peer-to-peer network,\n\n342\n00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:34.520\nyour Windows client operating\nsystem can act as a print server.\n\n343\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.950\nAnd when we talk about that,\nkeep in mind that a print server,\n\n344\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.800\nwhat you're doing is it's receiving,\nright?\n\n345\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.380\nSo we talk about, again, requesting\nservices and providing services.\n\n346\n00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.570\nIf I send a print job over the network,\nright,\n\n347\n00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.130\nsomething that I have to print over to\nanother computer, I'm acting as a client.\n\n348\n00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.784\nAnd that service that's being provided,\nthat hey yeah, you can send it to me and\n\n349\n00:17:54.784 --> 00:17:56.290\nI'll manage that print queue and\n\n350\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.319\nI'll send it to the right printer\nis the print server, all right?\n\n351\n00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:01.970\nSo that's essentially\nwhat a print server is.\n\n352\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.892\nDon't think of it, again, as having\nto be this really beefy computer.\n\n353\n00:18:04.892 --> 00:18:08.224\nI know, Dan I don't know about you, but\nI've seen some print servers that were\n\n354\n00:18:08.224 --> 00:18:10.213\nthe size of a Roku sitting\nout on your network and\n\n355\n00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:12.521\nall they were doing was just\nmanaging the print queue.\n\n356\n00:18:12.521 --> 00:18:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or you have them just\nbuilt into the device itself.\n\n357\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.235\nThey'll have print services, you go\nto the little LCD display screen and\n\n358\n00:18:19.235 --> 00:18:20.980\nstart bumping through the menus and\n\n359\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.620\nit says, would you like to\nmake this a print server?\n\n360\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.760\nWell yes I would, thank you very much.\n\n361\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.080\nTurn that on and there you go.\n\n362\n00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.370\nAnd they're doing that more and\nmore anymore, right?\n\n363\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\n\n364\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.700\nespecially on like you get smaller\nnetwork like SOHO networks like that.\n\n365\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.960\nAnd you get things like\nwireless communications, right?\n\n366\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.984\nYou're finding that built\ninto a lot of devices,\n\n367\n00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:41.944\nwhere they're doing with AirPrint,\nl in Mac-based devices and\n\n368\n00:18:41.944 --> 00:18:45.334\nstuff like that,\nWi-Fi direct type printing as well.\n\n369\n00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:49.949\nSo again, keep in mind that while we\nare talking a lot about the corporate\n\n370\n00:18:49.949 --> 00:18:53.220\nenvironment, it's just as valid\nespecially when it comes to printing\n\n371\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.610\nin SOHO environments or\nwork groups, all right?\n\n372\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:02.100\nSo that's a little bit about your mail\nservers as well, and print servers too.\n\n373\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.970\nKeep in mind that we do have some\nother type of servers that we need to\n\n374\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:05.780\nbe aware of, too.\n\n375\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.730\nAnd these sometimes can\nget a little confusing.\n\n376\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.390\nThese are proxies, all right?\n\n377\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.250\nNow we've talked about proxies before, and\n\n378\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.100\nI got a little diagram to kinda\nunderstand what's going on with a proxy.\n\n379\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.740\nAnd I kinda built this up as much as I\ncould so you can really, in a diagram,\n\n380\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.900\nsee what the heck is going on\nhere when we talk about a proxy.\n\n381\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.780\nWell, a proxy is kind of like a middleman,\nif you will.\n\n382\n00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.630\nMiddle person, if you will, not to exclude\nour ladies out there, between a request\n\n383\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:36.280\nbeing made and the author coming back and\nreturn to the client, right?\n\n384\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.810\nOne of the great things about a proxy is,\nand\n\n385\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.570\nI'm just gonna take\nForward Proxy out of here.\n\n386\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.870\nYou guys do not have to know about\nthe difference between a reverse and\n\n387\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.160\nforward proxy here at the A plus level.\n\n388\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.250\nWe talk more about that in the Net Plus,\nand certainly in Security Plus.\n\n389\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.190\nBut understand that the proxy,\na lot of times in this case is a web\n\n390\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.010\nproxy there are other services out\nthere that can be proxied as well, too.\n\n391\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.470\nBy large here at A plus,\nwe're talking about a web proxy.\n\n392\n00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.700\nAnd it just means that my client is\ngoing to make a web request, right?\n\n393\n00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.880\nJust like browsing to the Internet.\n\n394\n00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.700\nBut the difference here is instead\nof the web browser sending that\n\n395\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.270\ninformation out to lets say a website\nout there across the Internet.\n\n396\n00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.580\nWhat it does is it actually sends\nit to the proxy, all right, and\n\n397\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.640\nthen what the proxy does,\nwell a couple of things.\n\n398\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.110\nLet's say the proxy, it's the first\ntime it's received a web request for\n\n399\n00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.010\nthis website, www.anysite.org.\n\n400\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.710\nIf there's a site out there\nthat's www.anysite.org,\n\n401\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.645\nI apologize ahead of time.\n\n402\n00:20:33.645 --> 00:20:34.691\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just trying to generically\n\n403\n00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.960\nmake these up.\n\n404\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.960\nWell, what it's gonna do is if\nit's never received a request for\n\n405\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.080\nthat website is it's gonna generate\na completely new request, all right?\n\n406\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.900\nAnd when it does, it's gonna send it\noutbound through your network and\n\n407\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.110\nit's gonna send it over to the website.\n\n408\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.130\nNow the website,\nunderstand that from this standpoint,\n\n409\n00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.420\ndoesn't know that this client\nat all sent the request.\n\n410\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.960\nAll the website knows is\nthat it was the proxy\n\n411\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.840\nthat generated the web request and it\nsends that web request back to the proxy.\n\n412\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.470\nAll right, now once the proxy receives it,\nit does a couple of things.\n\n413\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.714\nAll right, one of the things that\nit does is it caches, right?\n\n414\n00:21:15.714 --> 00:21:17.878\nJust kind of like we\ntalked about DNS caching,\n\n415\n00:21:17.878 --> 00:21:20.160\ncaches on the local hard\ndrive that web request.\n\n416\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.009\nAnd then it sends it back\nto the original client.\n\n417\n00:21:23.009 --> 00:21:27.400\nNow, let's stop right there so you\nunderstand, what are the benefits of that?\n\n418\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.270\nAll right, well from a security standpoint\nthe proxy is the only thing that exists\n\n419\n00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.570\ninside of your network because when the\nweb server received the request it didn't\n\n420\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:40.150\nreceive it directly from the client,\nit only received it from the proxy.\n\n421\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.960\nSo everything behind essentially\nto your network if you will,\n\n422\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.660\nif I were to just kind of say here,\ntake this blot.\n\n423\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.570\nEverything behind your network\ndoesn't exist to that web server, and\n\n424\n00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.390\nthat's great for security purposes.\n\n425\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.560\nIf you want to try to\nkeep people from seeing,\n\n426\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.440\neasily seeing what's behind your network,\nit kind of obscures it.\n\n427\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.490\nNow the other great thing\nabout this is on the proxy\n\n428\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.560\nyou can control what sites can be seen.\n\n429\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.920\nYou can do things like content filtering,\nsometimes called URL filtering,\n\n430\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.220\nyou could base it on keywords and stuff.\n\n431\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.540\nCertain websites shouldn't\nbe viewed at work, right?\n\n432\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.180\nAnd there's some that are obvious, but\neven things like online gambling and\n\n433\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.360\nstuff, maybe you don't\nwant people going to.\n\n434\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:26.770\nMaybe you don't want your end users within\nyour business chewing up your bandwidth\n\n435\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.840\nby streaming Netflix, doing media\nstreaming, so you can control that, right?\n\n436\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.370\nThe other thing is, you can control\nwho has access, all right, as well.\n\n437\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.799\nNow the other great thing about this\ntoo is that let's say this next\n\n438\n00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:43.885\ncomputer decides that\nit wants to communicate\n\n439\n00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:47.622\nacross the Internet out\nhere with www.anysite.org.\n\n440\n00:22:47.622 --> 00:22:49.060\nSo what does it do?\n\n441\n00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.450\nWell, the second client actually makes\na web request, it hits the proxy and\n\n442\n00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.510\nthe proxy says, well, hold on a second let\nme check my cache here, let me find out.\n\n443\n00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.040\nYou know what?\n\n444\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.100\nThe first client's already requested\nthat and it's still up to date.\n\n445\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.326\nSo instead of having to reach out\nacross the Internet to www.anysite.org,\n\n446\n00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:07.911\nI'll just go ahead and\ngive you that information from the cache.\n\n447\n00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:09.126\nNow how does that benefit you?\n\n448\n00:23:09.126 --> 00:23:11.040\nWell, twofold, all right?\n\n449\n00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.340\nAnd I'm sure there's probably more, but\n\n450\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.110\ntwo that I can think of\noff the top of my head.\n\n451\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:20.180\nOne, is that it increases the response\ntime, I just had to find it locally.\n\n452\n00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.530\nTwo is it saves your bandwidth.\n\n453\n00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.180\nIf you've got some kind of metered\nconnection like that, which typically your\n\n454\n00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.140\ncorporate companies will have some\nkind of metered connection like this.\n\n455\n00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.810\nThey save their bandwidth as well.\n\n456\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.190\nSo you also have the proxies too.\n\n457\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.410\nSo proxies are great.\n\n458\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:38.425\nThey're great from a security standpoint,\ncontrolling who has access,\n\n459\n00:23:38.425 --> 00:23:43.439\nas well as even giving you the ability\nto control how much bandwidth you're\n\n460\n00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:48.468\nutilizing when it comes to multiple\nrequests to the same site, all right?\n\n461\n00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:50.835\nAll right,\nnow let's see where we are here,\n\n462\n00:23:50.835 --> 00:23:55.028\nI know we're running a little bit short\non time here, we only got a couple more.\n\n463\n00:23:55.028 --> 00:23:59.730\nThe other one that I wanna talk about is\nsomething known as an IDS, all right?\n\n464\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.901\nThese sometimes get a little confusing\ncuz there's what we call an IDS,\n\n465\n00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:07.885\nand there's what we call an IPS, right?\n\n466\n00:24:07.885 --> 00:24:11.294\nAn intrusion detection system and\nan intrusion prevention system.\n\n467\n00:24:11.294 --> 00:24:14.662\nAll right, so sorry to feed you alphabet\nsoup right here at the end, but\n\n468\n00:24:14.662 --> 00:24:15.966\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n469\n00:24:15.966 --> 00:24:18.956\nWell, the intrusion detection system,\nI want you to understand,\n\n470\n00:24:18.956 --> 00:24:21.061\nis really more of a passive device,\nall right?\n\n471\n00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:24.850\nIt sits out in your network and\nit does, primarily, three things.\n\n472\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.880\nIt monitors for signs of an intrusion,\njust like the names implies,\n\n473\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.590\nintrusion detection.\n\n474\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.019\nIt detects, well hopefully,\nthat's the goal [LAUGH].\n\n475\n00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:35.317\nIt detects, and\nthen it also sends down an alert,\n\n476\n00:24:35.317 --> 00:24:38.620\nwhether it'd be some kind of email or\nsome kind of SMS message, right?\n\n477\n00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now Wes, this is where\na lot of people get confused,\n\n478\n00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.930\nbecause you said this was an active,\nor I'm sorry, a passive technology.\n\n479\n00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.500\nBut it seems like it's\ndoing something active.\n\n480\n00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.921\nIt is detecting network attacks and\n\n481\n00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:50.996\nalerting to you too when\nthey have occurred.\n\n482\n00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:52.951\nSo how is that passive and not active?\n\n483\n00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:54.930\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n484\n00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.556\nBecause the next one,\nthe IPS goes a little bit father.\n\n485\n00:24:59.556 --> 00:25:03.493\nBecause one thing that the IDS lacks,\nreally,\n\n486\n00:25:03.493 --> 00:25:07.929\nin all actuality,\nthe IPS does the exact same thing.\n\n487\n00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:11.480\nBut one thing that the IDS\nlacks is countermeasures.\n\n488\n00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.630\nSee, an IPS is called\nan Intrusion Prevention System, all right?\n\n489\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.270\nAnd it does a lot the same thing.\n\n490\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.647\nBut see, the different between the IDS\nis that is another device on our network\n\n491\n00:25:24.647 --> 00:25:29.173\nwhere notice the IPS is screening all\ntraffic coming in and leaving the network?\n\n492\n00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:34.023\nAnd then, on top of that,\nit provides not only monitoring and\n\n493\n00:25:34.023 --> 00:25:39.360\ndetection, here's where the active\nnature is countermeasures.\n\n494\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:46.300\nWhen I find out, or the device, if I'm\ndiving into the device's mind right?\n\n495\n00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.920\nIf I find something that's going on,\nnow I don't just monitor and\n\n496\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.780\ndetect and say, hey Dan you've got\nsomething going on in your network.\n\n497\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.360\nI implement a countermeasure\nthat stops it in its tracks.\n\n498\n00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.030\nNow be careful with this one, right?\n\n499\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:04.386\nBecause the last one I'd like to\ntalk about is something known as\n\n500\n00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:06.410\nunified threat management.\n\n501\n00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.610\nAnd unified threat management,\nthis second one there, it's just for\n\n502\n00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.080\nyou guy's benefit.\n\n503\n00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.600\nAgain, keep in mind, we try not just for\nwhat's on the exam, but also real world.\n\n504\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.981\nYou might here it called not only UTM,\nunified threat management,\n\n505\n00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:22.673\nyou might hear it called USM, and\nthat's unified security management.\n\n506\n00:26:22.673 --> 00:26:24.411\nReally no different, all right?\n\n507\n00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:29.251\nBut a unified threat management\ndevice does all the same things of\n\n508\n00:26:29.251 --> 00:26:32.955\nintrusion detection and\nintrusion prevention.\n\n509\n00:26:32.955 --> 00:26:34.390\nBut it goes a little bit farther.\n\n510\n00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:39.949\nIt can implement things like firewall\nservices, gateway antivirus, as well.\n\n511\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.130\nAnd that's really what you find today.\n\n512\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.500\nA lot of times you don't find something\nthat is just an intrusion detection\n\n513\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.120\nsystem, you find one that's\nan intrusion prevention system.\n\n514\n00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.047\nWhy?\n\n515\n00:26:51.047 --> 00:26:52.560\nWell they can do both.\n\n516\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.600\nWell if I've got an intrusion detection\nsystem, why not just have an intrusion\n\n517\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.940\nprevention system that can also\nimplement some kind of countermeasure?\n\n518\n00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.850\nAnd we find this a lot today, all right?\n\n519\n00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:01.913\nNow, here's another one.\n\n520\n00:27:01.913 --> 00:27:04.170\nAgain not for the exam,\nmore for your own benefit.\n\n521\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:09.490\nIf you hear next-gen firewall, right,\nyou might hear it literally NG firewall.\n\n522\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.427\nThat's usually what these devices are\ntoday, is an intrusion prevention system,\n\n523\n00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:15.208\nit is an intrusion detection system.\n\n524\n00:27:15.208 --> 00:27:20.630\nIs a VPN concentrator, where it can\nalso do simultaneous VPN communications.\n\n525\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.784\nAs well as firewall services,\nas well as antivirus gateways.\n\n526\n00:27:24.784 --> 00:27:28.881\nAs well as, even, spam filters and\ncontent filters, right?\n\n527\n00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:31.480\nAnd that essentially is\nwhat the UTM device is.\n\n528\n00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.160\nJust think about unified\nthreat management.\n\n529\n00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.255\nAnd they go even farther than that, too.\n\n530\n00:27:36.255 --> 00:27:38.520\nThis is just very generic, right?\n\n531\n00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.624\nThey get to where they\nactually connect to the cloud,\n\n532\n00:27:40.624 --> 00:27:42.279\nconnect to your cloud-based services.\n\n533\n00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:45.690\nAnd can become things like your\nconnection security brokers.\n\n534\n00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.940\nCan find find out what's going\non across your cloud devices.\n\n535\n00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:54.270\nCan integrate with heuristics, where they\nactually contact the vendor's websites and\n\n536\n00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.870\npull down things like definitions and\nsubmit samples out there so\n\n537\n00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.960\nyou can be aware of things\nlike your zero-day threats,\n\n538\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.910\nwhich we'll talk about in\nthe security episodes, as well.\n\n539\n00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.960\nSo again, keep in mind what a unified\nthreat management device is.\n\n540\n00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.628\nLast one they talk about here,\n\n541\n00:28:09.628 --> 00:28:12.640\nladies and gentlemen, is one that\nI really don't have a diagram for.\n\n542\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.830\nThis is something known as legacy and\nembedded systems.\n\n543\n00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:20.166\nSo what's the issue with\nthese network host services?\n\n544\n00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.955\nAn embedded system, all right?\n\n545\n00:28:21.955 --> 00:28:24.720\nAn embedded system are like\nyour SCADA systems.\n\n546\n00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.860\nSupervisory data acquisition and\ncontrol system,\n\n547\n00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.230\nI believe, SCADA systems all right?\n\n548\n00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.560\nThese are devices where a lot of times\nwhat you have are what they call SoC,\n\n549\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.680\nsystem on a chip.\n\n550\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.400\nYou have everything built into the PCB,\nthe printed circuit board, itself.\n\n551\n00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.250\nA lot of times they have sensors\non them that do active sensing.\n\n552\n00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:51.110\nThey might even accept inputs where you\ncan control certain devices within things\n\n553\n00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.250\nlike manufacturing, as well.\n\n554\n00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.530\nLegacy systems.\n\n555\n00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.675\nNow, it's interesting because this doesn't\nreally have anything to do with security,\n\n556\n00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:02.992\nminus the internet appliances\nthat they talk about here,\n\n557\n00:29:02.992 --> 00:29:04.832\nwhich are the UTM, IPS and IDS.\n\n558\n00:29:04.832 --> 00:29:08.797\nBut you gottta be careful with Legacy\nsystems, because there are systems out\n\n559\n00:29:08.797 --> 00:29:13.280\nthere that we need and that you will\nsupport that they're not gonna upgrade.\n\n560\n00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.240\nAll right, why?\n\n561\n00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.030\nWell, you have devices out there that\nare maybe specific to a piece of software,\n\n562\n00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.715\nand it isn't broke, don't fix it, right?\n\n563\n00:29:21.715 --> 00:29:23.318\nWe're not gonna fix it until it is.\n\n564\n00:29:23.318 --> 00:29:26.450\nOr there's a device on your network that\nis supporting a piece of software that,\n\n565\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.844\nwell, we've mentioned many\ntimes throughout this series,\n\n566\n00:29:28.844 --> 00:29:30.842\nthat your company wants to\nget all their money for.\n\n567\n00:29:30.842 --> 00:29:31.631\nWorks, right?\n\n568\n00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:35.463\n$100,000 we just spent on this\nprotection system, right?\n\n569\n00:29:35.463 --> 00:29:38.879\nOr maybe not even a protection system,\nbut a piece of software out there.\n\n570\n00:29:38.879 --> 00:29:44.936\nAnd the only device that really\nsupports it is Windows XP box, right?\n\n571\n00:29:44.936 --> 00:29:50.608\nOr a Server 2003, which is well past it's\nlife cycle, you can't get updates for it.\n\n572\n00:29:50.608 --> 00:29:52.650\nSo be careful with these devices.\n\n573\n00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:57.390\nA lot of times what they'll do is they'll\ndo air gap networks on some of these\n\n574\n00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:02.390\nsystems so that you don't have to worry\nabout security vulnerabilities with them.\n\n575\n00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:08.396\nAgain, keep in mind, embedded systems\ntypically take small resource required or\n\n576\n00:30:08.396 --> 00:30:13.903\nsmall, resource-intensive,\nstreamlined operating systems, right?\n\n577\n00:30:13.903 --> 00:30:16.892\nA lot of times they're not\ngonna be like a Windows.\n\n578\n00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:19.508\nAnd there are Windows-embedded\noperating systems out there.\n\n579\n00:30:19.508 --> 00:30:22.069\nBut I will tell you, a lot times what\nthey're gonna be running is they're gonna\n\n580\n00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:24.250\nbe running some\nstripped-down form of Linux.\n\n581\n00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.380\nWhy?\n\n582\n00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.691\nBecause it's more stable.\n\n583\n00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:29.370\nA lot more that you can do with it.\n\n584\n00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.190\nAnd it runs in a very,\nvery small, small footprint.\n\n585\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.340\nCuz if I have an embedded system,\na lot of times what I don't have is a lot\n\n586\n00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.860\nof CPU power,\na lot of horsepower, if you will.\n\n587\n00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.670\nAnd if you can download\nsomething like Linux to it and\n\n588\n00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.530\nit only runs in 200 MGs of RAM,\nthen you're not really worried about it.\n\n589\n00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.579\nSo keep in mind embedded systems.\n\n590\n00:30:46.579 --> 00:30:51.434\nAnd then those legacy systems are the ones\nwhere the operating system and maybe even\n\n591\n00:30:51.434 --> 00:30:56.650\nthe hardware itself is well past its\nmanagement lifecycle from the vendor.\n\n592\n00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.330\nSo you can have them.\n\n593\n00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.320\nYou probably are gonna see them,\nmaybe even a few of them.\n\n594\n00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.045\nKeep in mind that they're also\na security vulnerability,\n\n595\n00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:06.338\ncuz a lot of time the vendors\nno longer patch them.\n\n596\n00:31:06.338 --> 00:31:08.560\nBut you might have to have\nthem in your company.\n\n597\n00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.360\nSo a lot of different\nnetwork host services.\n\n598\n00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.797\nOne of the last things I'll say,\nDan, here,\n\n599\n00:31:12.797 --> 00:31:15.920\nis just keep in mind, it't the service\nthe device is providing on your networks\n\n600\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.170\nthat defines what its functionality\nis within that network.\n\n601\n00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.132\n&gt;&gt; That's good stuff, Wes.\n\n602\n00:31:20.132 --> 00:31:24.424\nWe do appreciate you walking us through\nthese different types of servers, and\n\n603\n00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:28.262\nservices, and hosts that we might\nfind networked or connected inside\n\n604\n00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:32.572\nof our environments that we might have\nto actually support and administrate.\n\n605\n00:31:32.572 --> 00:31:36.734\nPeople are gonna say, hey, this thing's\noffline and something's not working.\n\n606\n00:31:36.734 --> 00:31:38.884\nWell, what are we gonna do?\nWe have to be familiar with what that\n\n607\n00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:41.819\nsomething is, and make sure that\nwe can get it back online so\n\n608\n00:31:41.819 --> 00:31:43.714\nthat people can take advantage of it.\n\n609\n00:31:43.714 --> 00:31:46.531\nWes, thanks for that, we do appreciate\nyou stopping by the studio today.\n\n610\n00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:48.438\nWe do thank our good audience for\nwatching.\n\n611\n00:31:48.438 --> 00:31:50.462\nHopefully you've gotten\na lot out of this episode.\n\n612\n00:31:50.462 --> 00:31:52.823\nBut it's our time to sign off.\n\n613\n00:31:52.823 --> 00:31:55.963\nThat's right, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n614\n00:31:55.963 --> 00:31:57.005\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n615\n00:31:57.005 --> 00:31:59.274\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:05.359\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.922\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:16.800\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.469\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're back with\n\n7\n00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.609\nmore in our A+ series,\nalways having a good time there.\n\n8\n00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.679\nSo joining us back in the studio to have\na good time with us, our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.303\nWes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:29.590\nWes, welcome back to the show sir,\nso glad to have you yet again today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.190\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.010\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.052\nGreat to be here, and regardless of what\nthe chat room says, I hope I will not be\n\n14\n00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:37.150\nhaving glass fragments-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.003\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] hitting my head with\n\n16\n00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:38.964\nmobile devices, that's right.\n\n17\n00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:42.250\n[CROSSTALK] We're gonna be looking\na little bit at some mobile devices.\n\n18\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.227\nWe're gonna be talking about really\ntwo of the most common ones.\n\n19\n00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:49.967\nWe'll mention another one that they kind\nof want you to know on the exam here, but\n\n20\n00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:54.847\nit's not really quite as popular, if you\nwill, as the two that we're going to kind\n\n21\n00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:59.265\nof demonstrate here for you, and\nwe hope to show you, and that is well iOS.\n\n22\n00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.200\nWe talked about mobile operating systems.\n\n23\n00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.393\nWe talked about iOS.\n\n24\n00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:07.030\nWe talked about the Android platform, and\nwell Windows mobile is out there, as well.\n\n25\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.896\nNow, IOS and Android,\nthey're really the two most popular and\n\n26\n00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.558\nmost common mobile operating\nsystems that are out there, right?\n\n27\n00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:18.743\nNow I'm certainly not picking\non Windows when I say this,\n\n28\n00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.890\nthat Windows isn't quite as popular.\n\n29\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.564\nAnd that's just because Windows' focus,\nthey kinda got into the mobile market.\n\n30\n00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:28.936\nA little bit late in the game, now\nthey've been into it for a while now but\n\n31\n00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:32.805\nlet's face it, iOS really kind of,\nthey jumped in, you know,\n\n32\n00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:36.630\nApple did if you will, jumped in and\nthey hit the gate running.\n\n33\n00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.913\nAnd then Android was probably\nright around the same time,\n\n34\n00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:42.260\nnot too far, not too long after, right?\n\n35\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.390\nAnd these have just become the two\nmost popular operating systems.\n\n36\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.350\nIn fact, if you were to look around\nthe office here at ITPro.TV,\n\n37\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.050\nthose are the two that you would find,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.599\nI know Dan and myself,\nwe both have the Android operating system.\n\n39\n00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.306\nI know that for\ninstance our CEO and Owner Tim,\n\n40\n00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:02.210\nhe absolutely loves everything Apple,\nso he's got IOS devices.\n\n41\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.604\nAnd a multitude of those different devices\nthat that operating system is running on.\n\n42\n00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:10.728\nNow let's talk about the operating systems\njust briefly here before we kinda show you\n\n43\n00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:13.029\nsome of the features that\nyou can expect to see.\n\n44\n00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.443\nWhen it comes to dealing with the IOS,\nagain from Apple, or\n\n45\n00:02:16.443 --> 00:02:22.040\nthe Android operating system if you will\ninside of, well, the Android market.\n\n46\n00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.870\nNow when we talk about a mobile\noperating system, understand\n\n47\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.970\nthat really what we're talking about is\na very small foot print operating system.\n\n48\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.455\nAll right, and I say small foot print\nbecause we're talking relative to like\n\n49\n00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:36.980\na full blown desktop if you will or\nserver operating system.\n\n50\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.806\nNow just as I say that understand that the\nmobile devices that we have today are ten\n\n51\n00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:43.507\ntimes more powerful than some\nof the computers that we had\n\n52\n00:02:43.507 --> 00:02:45.270\njust five years ago or ten years ago.\n\n53\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.219\nAnd maybe even 100 times you know more\npowerful than some of the earlier\n\n54\n00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.370\ncomputers for sure.\n\n55\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.901\nSo, again that's all relative to time you\ndefinitely have some very very powerful\n\n56\n00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:59.238\ndevices out there that have just as much\nif not more power than some of your common\n\n57\n00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:00.226\ndesktops today.\n\n58\n00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:03.793\nNow mobile operating systems, one of the\nthings that you also want to understand\n\n59\n00:03:03.793 --> 00:03:07.162\nrelative to the devices that they run on,\nthey really focus on a few things.\n\n60\n00:03:07.162 --> 00:03:09.165\nTwo main things, right.\n\n61\n00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:11.415\nOne of the main things is\nlow powered operations and\n\n62\n00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:15.110\nthe other thing is essentially\nthermal management that's\n\n63\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.020\ntwo of your most important things when\nit comes to any kind of mobile device.\n\n64\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.970\nSo, you'll have things like power\nsaving techniques that you have keep in\n\n65\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.470\nmind to preserve your battery life.\n\n66\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.037\nYou also,\n\n67\n00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:28.399\nyou know we're talking about very small\nplatform in the hardware device itself.\n\n68\n00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.970\nSo, we have to worry about overheating.\n\n69\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.887\nSo, that's one of the commonalities when\nit comes to a mobile operating system\n\n70\n00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:38.394\nversus something like again,\na full blown work station, if you will or\n\n71\n00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:39.517\nreally even a laptop.\n\n72\n00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:43.338\nWhich is essentially just a client\noperating system running on a smaller form\n\n73\n00:03:43.338 --> 00:03:47.332\nfactor device, like we say, for instance\nlike our MacBooks that Dan and I have,\n\n74\n00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:51.130\nSystem 76 machines that some of\nthe other hosts have and Windows, right?\n\n75\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.893\nSo, understand very streamline\noperating system and again,\n\n76\n00:03:54.893 --> 00:03:59.297\nit's really focused on things like\nbattery preservation, if you will.\n\n77\n00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:02.218\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense,\nbecause if you're anything like my wife,\n\n78\n00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:04.880\nyou're killing these things\nbatteries on a daily basis.\n\n79\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.067\nI don't know how she does it.\n\n80\n00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:09.710\nI can go a good two days\nwithout killing my battery.\n\n81\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.993\nShe can't go half a day and\nthat sucker's dead as a door nail [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:16.606\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, you know I'm glad that\nyou mentioned that because coming up we're\n\n83\n00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:20.015\ngonna have an episode on mobile\ndevice data synchronization.\n\n84\n00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:23.395\nAnd Dan and\nI have kinda talked behind the scenes.\n\n85\n00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.901\nAnd we'll mention that in this\nepisode because Dan's wife and\n\n86\n00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.996\nI both have the same phone.\n\n87\n00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:29.284\nAnd [LAUGH] I can do the same thing.\n\n88\n00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:31.597\nSo unfortunately, we're in the same boat.\n\n89\n00:04:31.597 --> 00:04:35.337\n[LAUGH] So let's talk a little bit\nmore about the software, right?\n\n90\n00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:36.867\nWhen we talk about software, right?\n\n91\n00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:39.187\nYou did mention in your objectives, right?\n\n92\n00:04:39.187 --> 00:04:42.917\nThey say Android versus iOS\nversus Windows, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.909\nAnd then one of the first objectives\nyou're gonna see, is well,\n\n94\n00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.577\nthis term open source and close source.\n\n95\n00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:50.507\nNow, we've kinda already mentioned that,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:53.727\nWhen we were talking about Linux,\nwe had a, Dan and\n\n97\n00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:56.885\nI had a MacOS and Linux episode.\n\n98\n00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:59.964\nWhere we talked about the difference\nbetween a proprietary operating systems\n\n99\n00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:00.996\nand open source, right?\n\n100\n00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:03.469\nYou'll say, well wait a second Wes,\nyou didn't say proprietary,\n\n101\n00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.330\nyou said close source.\n\n102\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.906\nWell, they're kinda synonymous terms.\n\n103\n00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:10.390\nProprietary means that a single company\nis the one that has copyrighted this.\n\n104\n00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.390\nIts their intellectual property, and\nthere's no way, well, I can't say there's\n\n105\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.860\nno way, legally, you're not supposed to be\nable to look into the make up, the code.\n\n106\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.560\nCopy the code, make modifications to it,\nand redistribute it as your own, right?\n\n107\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.110\nThat's close source,\nthat's proprietary, right?\n\n108\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.320\nAnd that's what the Windows operating\nsystem, the Windows mobile OS, like, for\n\n109\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.790\ninstance Windows 7 mobile today, you know,\n\n110\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.880\nit'd be Windows 8.1 mobile,\nWindows 8 mobile, if you will.\n\n111\n00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.054\nAnd really even,\nat the time in this recording,\n\n112\n00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:41.176\neven though according\nto the exam objectives,\n\n113\n00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:44.263\nyou don't have to worry about this,\nWindows 10 mobile, as well.\n\n114\n00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:46.160\nBut those are closed-source, right?\n\n115\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.659\nApple owns the rights, all of the rights\nif you will, to the iOS right?\n\n116\n00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.270\nAnd it's closed-source,\nit's their intellectual property, and\n\n117\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.590\nyou're outside of doing things that run\ninto illegalities like jail-breaking.\n\n118\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.990\nYou're really not supposed\nto be modifying the code.\n\n119\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.936\nAnd certainly not supposed\nto be redistributing it and\n\n120\n00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:04.170\nmaking a profit off of it, right.\n\n121\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.321\nThat would get you into some pretty hefty\nviolations, right, copyright violations.\n\n122\n00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:12.168\n&gt;&gt; And that's an interesting conversation\nto have because you think, well,\n\n123\n00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:13.800\nI purchased this, it's mine.\n\n124\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.400\nI should be able to do whatever\nI want to with it, right?\n\n125\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.530\nWhat they've kind of come up with is\nyou've purchased the hardware but\n\n126\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.810\nany software that's running on it is\nlicensed from us, so don't modify it.\n\n127\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.030\nIt's not yours technically,\nwe're just allowing you to use it.\n\n128\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nAnd that's right,\n\n129\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.380\nyou know in another episode that Dan and\n\n130\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.070\nI was in, we were talking about\nthings like your privacy.\n\n131\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.160\nWe talked about policies and we talk\nabout an end user license agreement.\n\n132\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.100\nBelieve it or not, when you purchase\nthe device from an original equipment\n\n133\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.480\nmanufacturer which means that let's\nsay that I've got a Google Pixel here,\n\n134\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.075\nI purchase this device.\n\n135\n00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:55.205\nWell, when I sign all the paperwork,\nand when I log into this device,\n\n136\n00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:59.365\nthere's an end user license agreement\nsometimes that you have to adhere to.\n\n137\n00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:02.015\nAnd it basically means\nthis is not your software.\n\n138\n00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:02.945\nThis isn't your software.\n\n139\n00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:06.085\nAny of you that have ever installed\nan operating system on a workstation know\n\n140\n00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:09.321\nthat one of the first things that you have\nto do is you have to accept that end user\n\n141\n00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:10.222\nlicense agreement.\n\n142\n00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:14.450\nNow keep in mind, the manufacturer might\nhave done that on your behalf before they\n\n143\n00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.240\never sold you to the device right?\n\n144\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.152\nSo you go to a place like Verizon,\nyou go to a place like AT&amp;T,\n\n145\n00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:21.170\nyou go to a place like Sprint, T-Mobile.\n\n146\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.196\nAll these and other ones out there and\n\n147\n00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:26.853\na lot of times when you purchase\nthe device and you sign on the dotted\n\n148\n00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:30.720\nline you might be adhering to an EULA\nthat maybe you weren't aware of.\n\n149\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.755\nSo be very careful when it comes\nto closed source and proprietary.\n\n150\n00:07:33.755 --> 00:07:36.574\nOperating systems and\nthey could be vendor specific too,\n\n151\n00:07:36.574 --> 00:07:39.520\nsee that's another thing they\ncall out as vendor specific.\n\n152\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.640\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n153\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.455\nWell, what I mean by that,\nlet's go ahead if we will,\n\n154\n00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:46.249\nlet's take a look at my computer.\n\n155\n00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:48.790\nVendor specific right, we have an Apple.\n\n156\n00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:54.100\nAn Apple IOS this is vendor\nspecific it's specific to Apple.\n\n157\n00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.547\nAndroid gets a little\ndifferent on this one.\n\n158\n00:07:56.547 --> 00:08:01.652\nIt can be vendor specific and what I mean\nby that is if I was to dig down in here I\n\n159\n00:08:01.652 --> 00:08:07.347\nbelieve I might see things like Let's see\nif I can, okay so if we, yeah there we go.\n\n160\n00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:10.995\nSo if I zoom in here, notice that\nwe got some applications here, and\n\n161\n00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:13.880\nnotice these applications,\nwhat do they say?\n\n162\n00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.649\nThey say T-Mobile, right,\n\n163\n00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:19.910\nwell is that something that you\nfind in every Android device?\n\n164\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.190\nWell no, right, you're not gonna\nfind that in my Android device, and\n\n165\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.150\nI'm not sure exactly who you for\nyour carrier or your provider, Dan.\n\n166\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.300\nBut if you don't have T-Mobile-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm AT&amp;T.\n\n167\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.591\n&gt;&gt; You're AT&amp;T, right, so\n\n168\n00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:33.380\nthere are things that we want you to\nunderstand that are vendor specific.\n\n169\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.162\nAnd that means that they're vender\nspecific to whoever it was, it could be\n\n170\n00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:41.137\nthe carrier, that you have, that you\npurchased the device from, all right?\n\n171\n00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:45.396\nSo, vender specific, could be Microsoft,\nright, it could be Apple, when comes to\n\n172\n00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:49.540\nAndroid, it could be the carrier that\nyou've actually purchased the phone from,\n\n173\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.860\nor purchased the device.\n\n174\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.120\nNow, notice that we got a phone,\nwe had a phone and we have a tablet, so\n\n175\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.340\nthis doesn't just apply to cellular\nphones, it also applies to tablets, right?\n\n176\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.809\nNow the other side of\nthe tracks is open source.\n\n177\n00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:05.720\nAnd when we talk about things like open\nsource, we want you to understand that\n\n178\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.730\nopen source typically means\nthat it's under some kind of,\n\n179\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.330\nwhat they call the GPL,\nthe GNU, Public License.\n\n180\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.000\nAnd that's overseen by\nthe Free Software Foundation, and\n\n181\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.720\nit generally means the kernel itself,\nthe Linux kernel that,\n\n182\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.810\nessentially, Android is built on top of,\nit means you can modify it.\n\n183\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.638\nIt means you can look at the source,\nyou can make modifications, and\n\n184\n00:09:26.638 --> 00:09:28.422\nyou're free to distribute it.\n\n185\n00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:35.400\nNow, again, you have to keep in mind that,\nThere's always a catch 22, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.360\nSome vendors do not allow you to do\nthings like rooting your devices,\n\n187\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.695\nand, you understand what a jailbreak and\na root is, all right?\n\n188\n00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:47.690\nJailbreak means that hey, I'm not gonna\nfollow Apple's End User License Agreement,\n\n189\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.830\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put custom\nfirmware on there, or custom ROMs.\n\n190\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.788\nAnd that could be, and a lot of times is,\n\n191\n00:09:53.788 --> 00:09:56.327\na violation of your\nEnd User License Agreement, and\n\n192\n00:09:56.327 --> 00:09:58.882\nit could run you into issues, and-\n&gt;&gt; They don't like it, Wes.\n\n193\n00:09:58.882 --> 00:09:59.533\n&gt;&gt; Right-\n\n194\n00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:00.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly-\n\n195\n00:10:00.514 --> 00:10:01.378\n&gt;&gt; They don't like it at all.\n\n196\n00:10:01.378 --> 00:10:05.564\n&gt;&gt; They don't, and they make money on\nkeeping things like, for instance,\n\n197\n00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.938\nvendor specific applications on there.\n\n198\n00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:10.874\nSame thing goes with rooting,\na lot of people like to root,\n\n199\n00:10:10.874 --> 00:10:13.180\nbecause root means they\nnow have root access.\n\n200\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.493\nNo different than what we talked about in\nLinux, right, when you have root access,\n\n201\n00:10:17.493 --> 00:10:19.582\nthat means you can make modifications.\n\n202\n00:10:19.582 --> 00:10:22.332\nBasically you have unrestricted\naccess to the kernel, and\n\n203\n00:10:22.332 --> 00:10:25.522\nall the components within the kernel,\nincluding the software, and\n\n204\n00:10:25.522 --> 00:10:28.052\nyou can download from different sources,\nall right?\n\n205\n00:10:28.052 --> 00:10:30.015\nNow, speaking of downloading from sources,\n\n206\n00:10:30.015 --> 00:10:33.160\nthat's the next thing that we gotta\ntalk about, application sources.\n\n207\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.145\nThey call it specifically app sources,\nunderstand apps, applications,\n\n208\n00:10:37.145 --> 00:10:40.392\nsynonymous terms,\ndon't let that confuse you, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:44.028\nWhen we talk about apps or app sources,\napplication sources, we usually have two\n\n210\n00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:47.890\ndifferent, well, three different kinds,\ncuz we always got to keep in mind Windows.\n\n211\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.533\nI'm not gonna really be showing [LAUGH]\ntoo many Windows mobile devices.\n\n212\n00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:53.877\nAnd again,\nit's not because they're not good devices,\n\n213\n00:10:53.877 --> 00:10:58.080\nthey're just not quite as prevalent\nas the iOS and the Android devices.\n\n214\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.255\nSo when we talk about app sources,\nwhat are we talking about, all right?\n\n215\n00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:05.576\nThe location that you go to purchase,\ndownload, and install the applications or\n\n216\n00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:09.620\napps that will run on your mobile devices,\nand you do have a few options.\n\n217\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.985\nNow sometimes you have extra options,\n\n218\n00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:18.470\n[LAUGH] but that really is contingent on\nhow you configure your mobile devices.\n\n219\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.320\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nin fact here on the iPad, right?\n\n220\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.940\nYou'll notice that we have something\nknown right here as the App Store.\n\n221\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.520\nAgain, this is vendor specific, this is\ngonna be on your iOS based devices, right?\n\n222\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.257\nAnd if I open up the iOS, all right,\nI have applications that I can install,\n\n223\n00:11:36.257 --> 00:11:36.784\nright?\n\n224\n00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:41.716\nNow again, guys and gals out there,\nkeep in mind we're not making any money on\n\n225\n00:11:41.716 --> 00:11:46.827\nthese or anything, so we're not trying\nto advertise Madden 2K, or whatever.\n\n226\n00:11:46.827 --> 00:11:51.647\nBut this is where I would go to download\nmy applications or apps, if you will,\n\n227\n00:11:51.647 --> 00:11:56.337\ninside of an iOS device, whether it's\nan iPhone, whether it's an iPad.\n\n228\n00:11:56.337 --> 00:12:01.653\nBut then I also have the ability to do\nthis inside of your Android devices,\n\n229\n00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:05.840\ntoo, and in Android devices,\nspecific to Andrew.\n\n230\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.088\nAndrew, I don't know who Andrew is.\n\n231\n00:12:07.088 --> 00:12:08.040\n&gt;&gt; He's a nice guy.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n232\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what it is?\n\n233\n00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.228\nWe had,\none of our viewers' name is Andrew, and\n\n234\n00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:13.400\nI'm expecting him to\n[LAUGH] be here today.\n\n235\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.351\nWrong episode, Wes.\n\n236\n00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:15.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:15.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:16.152\n&gt;&gt; Swing and a miss.\n\n239\n00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:16.821\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n240\n00:12:16.821 --> 00:12:20.327\nthat's right, air ball on camera.\nOne of the things you'll [LAUGH] notice,\n\n241\n00:12:20.327 --> 00:12:23.667\nand probably Andrew will too [LAUGH]\nis the Play Store here, right?\n\n242\n00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:24.997\nSo the Google Play Store,\n\n243\n00:12:24.997 --> 00:12:30.159\nthis is where you would go to\ndownload your Google apps,\n\n244\n00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:32.516\nright?\nAnd Google apps, again,\n\n245\n00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:35.801\nis really no different than\nsomething that you have, like for\n\n246\n00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:40.437\ninstance, inside of the App Store here.\nThis gives you the ability to download and\n\n247\n00:12:40.437 --> 00:12:45.220\ninstall applications, right, so\nwe could definitely do that, too.\n\n248\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:51.715\nAll right now, great thing to have,\nunderstand that there are other sources\n\n249\n00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:57.120\ntoo, of applications, depending on how you\nhave your phone configured, all right?\n\n250\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.790\nSo for instance,\nif you're in Android, right?\n\n251\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.830\nNow outside of doing something like\njailbreaking your iPad, you're pretty much\n\n252\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.950\ngonna get, all of your applications\nare gonna come from the App Store.\n\n253\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.550\nWe're not advocating jailbreaking here,\nbut I just gotta mention it because,\n\n254\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.630\nas you move into maybe\nthe enterprise environment,\n\n255\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.870\njailbreaking does run\na security vulnerability.\n\n256\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.852\nIn the fact that you don't really\nhave a good way to lock down and\n\n257\n00:13:18.852 --> 00:13:20.443\nprotect your operating system.\n\n258\n00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:23.572\n&gt;&gt; You're kinda blowing through that\nwhole sandboxed environment that they've\n\n259\n00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:24.278\ncreated for you.\n\n260\n00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:26.031\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And opening that box up,\n\n261\n00:13:26.031 --> 00:13:28.631\nso that you can do things\nit's not meant to do.\n\n262\n00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nI like how you mentioned that sandboxing.\n\n263\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.204\nRight now, not only can we do things,\nbut, well,\n\n264\n00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:36.997\nwas it Andrew that mentioned this, right?\n\n265\n00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:39.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those computers only do what we tell\n\n266\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.960\nthem to do, and sometimes that becomes\na security vulnerability in and of itself.\n\n267\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.300\nSo understand that, for instance,\nif we go back to my screen here,\n\n268\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:54.760\nyou do have the ability, in your Android\ndevices, to download from other sources.\n\n269\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.728\nHowever, be careful here, so\nI could do this, going into my App Locker,\n\n270\n00:13:59.728 --> 00:14:02.306\nand I could go to Settings right here.\n\n271\n00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:06.547\nThis is one way that you can go, or you\ncan just kinda pin Settings to one of your\n\n272\n00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:09.760\nlittle screens here, and\nthat's kinda what I've done.\n\n273\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.480\nSo either way, but be careful with this,\n\n274\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.720\nright, because, let me see,\nis it in Developer options?\n\n275\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.954\nThink this is downloading from unknown\nsources, and that's our Developer options,\n\n276\n00:14:21.954 --> 00:14:28.195\nso that is not where we want,\nMy device, And where is that,\n\n277\n00:14:28.195 --> 00:14:33.853\nI seem to have lost that,\nApplication manager?\n\n278\n00:14:38.173 --> 00:14:42.118\nNo, that is not where it is, it's\nprobably in Security, yep there we go,\n\n279\n00:14:42.118 --> 00:14:46.349\nsorry guys,\n[LAUGH] I've got a Google Pixel, and\n\n280\n00:14:46.349 --> 00:14:49.354\nGoogle does their Android\nplatform completely different.\n\n281\n00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which is another mention that I should-\n\n282\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.300\n&gt;&gt; It is a little crazy,\n\n283\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.430\nif I try to use my wife's phone,\n\n284\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.190\nI have a Galaxy S8,\nit's completely backwards from everything.\n\n285\n00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.210\nSo the back button is on the other side,\n\n286\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.665\nand everything's just like, I'm like,\nwhat are you doing with this phone?\n\n287\n00:15:03.665 --> 00:15:05.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact,\n\n288\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.540\nwe're gonna get into, and\nI'll show you here what I'm talking about,\n\n289\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.790\nwe'll get into emergency notifications,\nright?\n\n290\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.400\nAnd the emergency notifications that I'm\ngonna show you here in Android coming up\n\n291\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.910\nis pretty much consistent\nwith Samsung devices.\n\n292\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.037\nI went to the Google location,\ncuz I have a Google Android device, and\n\n293\n00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:22.417\nit's completely different.\n\n294\n00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:23.701\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So Nate and I,\n\n295\n00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:25.757\none of our facilities manager here,\n\n296\n00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:29.485\none of the guys behind the scenes\nthat helps keep ITProTV running.\n\n297\n00:15:29.485 --> 00:15:33.480\n[LAUGH] I said okay, I need you to\ngo here, I need you to go here and,\n\n298\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.880\nwait it's not there.\n\n299\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.540\nSo that does happen, but\nlet's go ahead and go back to this,\n\n300\n00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.310\nand let me just kind of show\nyou this again one more time.\n\n301\n00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.950\nSo if you need to get to this location,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n302\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.370\njust kinda do this from\nthe beginning here.\n\n303\n00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.820\nSettings, all right, we're gonna go to\nMore, and then we'll go to Security,\n\n304\n00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.766\nand then you'll see, well,\nthere's Unknown sources.\n\n305\n00:15:55.766 --> 00:16:00.597\nNotice that it says, Allow installation\nof applications from both trusted and\n\n306\n00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:01.760\nunknown sources.\n\n307\n00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.060\nNow, what this means, ladies and gentlemen\nhere, let me take a second here and\n\n308\n00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.499\nkind of explain that, all right?\n\n309\n00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:12.220\nWhat unknown sources and, or trusted\nsources if you will, and unknown sources.\n\n310\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.456\nTrusted sources means they're\ncoming from the Google Play Store.\n\n311\n00:16:16.456 --> 00:16:19.657\nIt means that Google,\nto get an application there,\n\n312\n00:16:19.657 --> 00:16:23.439\nyou have to go to Google,\nthey have to test your application,\n\n313\n00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:27.222\nthey have to make sure that it's\nnot passing out malware, and\n\n314\n00:16:27.222 --> 00:16:30.850\nthat it isn't going to corrupt\nyour operating system.\n\n315\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.323\nIt doesn't mean that it\nwon't have bugs and flaws,\n\n316\n00:16:32.323 --> 00:16:34.035\nthat's just the way software is,\nit just happens that way.\n\n317\n00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:38.025\nUnknown source means it's\nnot coming from google.\n\n318\n00:16:38.025 --> 00:16:43.680\nIt means that there's no real guarantee\non the validity of that application, app.\n\n319\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.068\nThere's no guarantee that it isn't\ngonna cause some kind of instability\n\n320\n00:16:48.068 --> 00:16:51.747\nwithin your operating system\non your phone, or your tablet,\n\n321\n00:16:51.747 --> 00:16:56.698\nand the other thing is too, a lot of times\nthey don't have a digital certificates,\n\n322\n00:16:56.698 --> 00:17:00.449\nthe certificates like we talked\nabout in things like Windows,\n\n323\n00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:05.333\nwhen we were mentioning Windows, Digital\ncertificates where the way things like\n\n324\n00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:09.718\nsmart screen filter says, yeah,\nI know what that application is, and\n\n325\n00:17:09.718 --> 00:17:13.260\nI trust it, I can check it\nagainst a reputation database.\n\n326\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.481\nI don't get the ability to do that here,\nso be very careful, and\n\n327\n00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:20.120\nnow if we'll go back to my screen here\nreal quick I will show you that we can\n\n328\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.588\njust turn that on, and\nnotice the warning here.\n\n329\n00:17:22.588 --> 00:17:27.299\nIt tells you, can be harmful to your\ndevice and personal data by tapping OK,\n\n330\n00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:32.690\nyou agree that your sole, you, are solely\nresponsible for any damage to your device.\n\n331\n00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.161\nSo damaging of the device, instability\nin the operating system, loss of data.\n\n332\n00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:39.837\nAgain, we'll get into some\nsecurity issues that we might see.\n\n333\n00:17:39.837 --> 00:17:40.645\nMaybe people are scraping your data.\n\n334\n00:17:40.645 --> 00:17:44.940\nMaybe the permissions aren't\npresented like they are.\n\n335\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.595\nThat's another thing, in the Google Play\nthey'll present you with the permissions,\n\n336\n00:17:47.595 --> 00:17:50.850\nthat's a requirement of getting your\napplication into Google Play Store.\n\n337\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.576\nWe say OK to this.\n\n338\n00:17:52.576 --> 00:17:56.322\nNow you're kinda walking the highwire,\nand you don't have a net anymore, so\n\n339\n00:17:56.322 --> 00:17:57.560\nyou have to be careful.\n\n340\n00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.872\nIf you fall-\n&gt;&gt; And it's a windy day.\n\n341\n00:17:58.872 --> 00:18:01.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes sir, that's right.\n\n342\n00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.818\nSo if you fall,\nit's gonna be your responsibility.\n\n343\n00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:06.879\nNow that being said,\nthat's our disclaimer out of the way,\n\n344\n00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:10.370\nbecause there are some benefits\nto doing this as well.\n\n345\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.510\nAgain, one of the benefits is you can\ngo to some place like Amazon, and\n\n346\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.830\nAmazon has their Amazon app store.\n\n347\n00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.630\nI have probably 200 Amazon applications,\nbut\n\n348\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.020\nyou cannot download\nsomething known as the APK.\n\n349\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.408\nAll right, APKs are how we\ninstall applications here within\n\n350\n00:18:27.408 --> 00:18:31.205\nthe operating system,\nandroid operating system.\n\n351\n00:18:31.205 --> 00:18:33.395\nSo, for instance,\nif I'm gonna download and\n\n352\n00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:36.650\nI'm gonna install something in\nWindows right, what am I gonna do?\n\n353\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.610\nI'm gonna use a .exe,\nthat application's gonna be an installer.\n\n354\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:45.529\nIt's more correctly an executable,\nbut a lot of times they execute\n\n355\n00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:50.710\nthe installer, if that makes sense right,\nwithout the axe.\n\n356\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.264\n[LAUGH] Inside a Mac it's usually, you'll\nsee a lot of times, it's like a DMG,\n\n357\n00:18:54.264 --> 00:18:55.070\ndisk image file.\n\n358\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.090\nWell, guess what?\n\n359\n00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.050\nHere inside of Android it's an APK.\n\n360\n00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.904\nYou could also see SDKs too.\n\n361\n00:19:00.904 --> 00:19:05.673\nSDKs are just software development kits,\nand sometimes if you are gonna\n\n362\n00:19:05.673 --> 00:19:10.753\nconnect your phone to your computer,\nbecause you wanna be able to talk to it,\n\n363\n00:19:10.753 --> 00:19:14.296\nyou have to go down or\ngo out to, I think it's Google.\n\n364\n00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:16.693\nIt might be,\ncan't think of the repository,\n\n365\n00:19:16.693 --> 00:19:20.195\nGitHub, I think, might actually have it,\nwhere you could go, and\n\n366\n00:19:20.195 --> 00:19:23.280\nyou can get what's called\nthe Android debug bridge, ADB.\n\n367\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.846\nIt's a software development kit,\n\n368\n00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:28.000\nallows you to your computer\ncommunicate with your Android devices.\n\n369\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.621\nBut, once I've downloaded the Amazon store\nAPK, I can now install the Amazon store,\n\n370\n00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:37.625\nwhich I couldn't do before that\nsetting was configured, and\n\n371\n00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.945\nI can download the DB\napplications from my Amazon.\n\n372\n00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:44.996\nAll right, now whether you do that or not,\nit is up to you, but it does present,\n\n373\n00:19:44.996 --> 00:19:45.974\nI want you to know.\n\n374\n00:19:45.974 --> 00:19:49.148\nWe want you to be prepared,\nbecause some people do that, and\n\n375\n00:19:49.148 --> 00:19:53.074\nyou might be supporting a phone that\nmaybe has that already installed, and\n\n376\n00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:54.720\nmaybe it's caused a problem.\n\n377\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.622\nMaybe they didn't adhere to the warning,\nand for\n\n378\n00:19:57.622 --> 00:20:02.129\nwhatever reason, they downloaded an APK,\nand it's now causing problems.\n\n379\n00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:03.130\nYou have to be aware of it.\n\n380\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.850\nYou have to know what that means.\n\n381\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:11.065\nSo that's a little bit about your\ninstallation sources, your app sources.\n\n382\n00:20:11.065 --> 00:20:12.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I can say that.\n\n383\n00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.355\nLast one I didn't mention\nis the Windows store.\n\n384\n00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:16.025\nThey just call it the store.\n\n385\n00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:17.740\nUnderstand that's the Windows store.\n\n386\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.585\nIf you guys out there are into Xbox Live,\nif you got an Xbox live account and\n\n387\n00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:25.335\nyou log into Xbox, it's the same thing.\n\n388\n00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:28.346\nSame Microsoft account.\n\n389\n00:20:28.346 --> 00:20:32.660\nBasically what it is,\nit's a multi-authentications.\n\n390\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.215\nIt's single sign-on, multiple,\nmutual authentication.\n\n391\n00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:40.016\nEssentially I can sign into one account,\nand\n\n392\n00:20:40.016 --> 00:20:44.820\nI can log into all the different services\nthat, that provider will give you.\n\n393\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.953\nSo for instance, I have my Apple ID I\ncan log into, things like iTune, iCloud,\n\n394\n00:20:48.953 --> 00:20:52.410\nand we'll talk about this a little\nbit more in other episodes, but\n\n395\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.160\nI can also log into the app store.\n\n396\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.560\nSame thing goes with,\nfor instance, Google.\n\n397\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.423\nIf you want to log into Google,\nyou sign-up with your phone,\n\n398\n00:20:59.423 --> 00:21:02.467\nwith your Google account,\nallows you to log into the Play Store.\n\n399\n00:21:02.467 --> 00:21:03.134\nWell, guess what?\n\n400\n00:21:03.134 --> 00:21:04.134\nWindows Store is there, too.\n\n401\n00:21:04.134 --> 00:21:05.770\nAgain, just called Store.\n\n402\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.700\nI just say Windows to kind of\ndifferentiate it from the other ones.\n\n403\n00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.890\nYou also have that as a source, likewise.\n\n404\n00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.550\nAll right,\nlet's see what we got here, Dan.\n\n405\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.520\nSome of the other things they call out is\nscreen orientation and screen calibration.\n\n406\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.787\nAll right, when it comes to screen\norientation, I do want you to\n\n407\n00:21:20.787 --> 00:21:24.612\nunderstand that they call out two things,\naccelerometer and gyroscope.\n\n408\n00:21:24.612 --> 00:21:27.318\nAll right,\nnow accelerometer's kind of cool,\n\n409\n00:21:27.318 --> 00:21:32.040\nbecause that is what gives you your screen\norientation when you move it around.\n\n410\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.800\nYour gyroscope is interesting because\nit adds an extra functionality, like\n\n411\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.800\nthe pitch of how you roll your phone, but\nwhat's interesting they don't talk about,\n\n412\n00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.050\nand I wanna do that here,\nbecause I think it's cool.\n\n413\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.500\nWe can try to be fun here.\n\n414\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.460\nIt's not just about what's on the exam.\n\n415\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.583\nI wanna talk about some of the other\nsensors that maybe you weren't aware\n\n416\n00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:51.720\nof that are on your phone.\n\n417\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.180\nYour phones are amazing little devices,\n\n418\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.740\neven though they only call out the\naccelerometer, which is screen position,\n\n419\n00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.570\nand a gyroscope,\nwhich give you your tilt or your pitch,\n\n420\n00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.926\nI guess you might say,-\n&gt;&gt; Pitch and the YAW.\n\n421\n00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:03.567\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\n\n422\n00:22:03.567 --> 00:22:04.126\nthat's exactly what it is, yeah.\n\n423\n00:22:04.126 --> 00:22:07.950\nY-A-W, right?\n\n424\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.561\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n425\n00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:12.224\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so they help you know what\nthe position of the phone is, right, and\n\n426\n00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:13.560\nwhat its orientation is.\n\n427\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.367\nThe gyroscope is in a 3D space, right?\n\n428\n00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:16.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n429\n00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.600\n&gt;&gt; You have other ones too, and well,\nthey talk about screen calibration.\n\n430\n00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.849\nYou might have to calibrate your screen.\n\n431\n00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:26.040\n&gt;&gt; That's what I said,\nwhen do you ever calibrate a screen?\n\n432\n00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.053\nIt's a very rare occasion, right?\n\n433\n00:22:27.053 --> 00:22:31.346\n&gt;&gt; I will tell you, the only time I've\never had to do it is when we do what we're\n\n434\n00:22:31.346 --> 00:22:34.834\nnot advocating here, and\nthat is jail breaking or routing.\n\n435\n00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:35.920\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n436\n00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.394\n&gt;&gt; The operating systems that\nare meant to be on these devices,\n\n437\n00:22:39.394 --> 00:22:41.515\na lot of times they do it themselves.\n\n438\n00:22:41.515 --> 00:22:44.090\nIf you jailbreak a root you're, again-\n&gt;&gt; I've changed the way it's-\n\n439\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.885\n&gt;&gt; I've done this,\n\n440\n00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:46.855\nyou're out of the sandbox, like Dan said.\n\n441\n00:22:46.855 --> 00:22:49.080\nSo you might have to do calibrations.\n\n442\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.100\nBut tell you what,\nwe're not out of the water here.\n\n443\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.123\nLet me show you something kind of\ncool that's built into a lot of your\n\n444\n00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:54.983\nAndroid devices.\n\n445\n00:22:54.983 --> 00:22:59.760\nSo I'm gonna go to my phone here, and\nyes, we're talking about the dial pad.\n\n446\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.780\nBe very careful in what I'm to do here.\n\n447\n00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.251\nDon't just start messing around on your\nphone without understanding you could\n\n448\n00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.660\ndamage your phone here.\n\n449\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.806\nSo I'm gonna, this is one that is\nreally on a lot of android devices.\n\n450\n00:23:11.806 --> 00:23:19.420\nSo I'm gonna do*#0#*, and you know,\nI didn't do that right, *#, there we go.\n\n451\n00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.580\nWhat you're gonna see is it goes into\nwhat's known as a field service mode, and\n\n452\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.876\nmost of your android devices have this,\nand\n\n453\n00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:29.900\nyou can see there's all different\nkinds of things, that we could test.\n\n454\n00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:35.516\nI could test like for instance,\nwell let's do sensors.\n\n455\n00:23:35.516 --> 00:23:37.810\nLook at all the different\nsensors you have.\n\n456\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.330\nI can see what the accelerometer is.\n\n457\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.619\n&gt;&gt; Barometer [LAUGH].\n\n458\n00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:44.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, And you can see, you guys can't\nsee that I'm actually moving my phone\n\n459\n00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:48.106\nhere, but it's actually moving because\nI\"m doing the screen orientation.\n\n460\n00:23:48.106 --> 00:23:52.761\nYou'll notice the gyroscope is now gonna\ngo into 100s versus just in the tens,\n\n461\n00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:57.228\ncuz I'm doing the, you said the pitch and\nthe YAW, is that what you said to it?\n\n462\n00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.256\nBut notice that we also\nhave proximity sensor.\n\n463\n00:24:01.256 --> 00:24:03.381\nI don't know if it'll give,\nyep there's the green screen.\n\n464\n00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:07.674\nAll right, so proximity sensors is\nreally cool, and what that's doing Is,\n\n465\n00:24:07.674 --> 00:24:09.588\nas I get close to the front camera,\n\n466\n00:24:09.588 --> 00:24:13.370\nit's letting me know that it's\npicking up the proximity, right?\n\n467\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:18.276\nSo that's perfect for things that,\nand especially, let me go back here.\n\n468\n00:24:18.276 --> 00:24:21.661\nYou have TSP Hovering in a lot\nof these Android devices,\n\n469\n00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:24.479\nwhich also happens with\nmaybe some of the iOS.\n\n470\n00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:27.148\nBut I know it's specifically\nthe Android devices, and\n\n471\n00:24:27.148 --> 00:24:30.229\nI know, definitely, Dan,\nwith your Galaxy S series, right?\n\n472\n00:24:30.229 --> 00:24:32.587\nThis is a little older one, S4.\n\n473\n00:24:32.587 --> 00:24:37.150\nBut I know this is TSP Hovering in your\nGalaxy S8, is you can do air waves and\n\n474\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.542\nstuff and switch between the screens,\n\n475\n00:24:39.542 --> 00:24:43.440\nwhere you're not actually\ntouching the screen itself.\n\n476\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.700\nWell, this actually diagnoses it, right?\n\n477\n00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.160\nAnd you'll notice,\nDan will have to verify here,\n\n478\n00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.030\nI'm not actually touching the screen.\n\n479\n00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.710\n&gt;&gt; He's like a 12-year-old big brother\n\n480\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.768\nin the back seat of a car\nwith his little sister.\n\n481\n00:24:55.768 --> 00:24:56.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's not touching it.\n\n482\n00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:59.270\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n483\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.030\n&gt;&gt; So I'm actually hovering right over.\n\n484\n00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:06.080\nAnd what that was is, and again,\nin combination with the proximity sensor,\n\n485\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.000\nit's letting me know that, hey,\nyou're not actually touching the phone.\n\n486\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.720\nI just bumped the mic there, sorry, guys.\n\n487\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.749\nYou're not actually touching the phone,\nbut you're actually hovering over it.\n\n488\n00:25:13.749 --> 00:25:16.710\nYou could see the light sensor, and\nthe light sensor is kinda cool.\n\n489\n00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.110\nLet me show you the light sensor here.\n\n490\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.790\nLet me move this back so\nI'm not bumping the microphone.\n\n491\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.010\nI'm gonna cover up the front camera.\n\n492\n00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.590\nNotice how the level goes down.\n\n493\n00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.868\nNow, this is light sensitivity, right,\nbecause there's a lot of things.\n\n494\n00:25:27.868 --> 00:25:29.622\n&gt;&gt; That's how it does the auto-dimming\nof the screen, I think, yeah.\n\n495\n00:25:29.622 --> 00:25:31.170\n&gt;&gt; You got it, absolutely.\n\n496\n00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.950\nYeah, great, and barometer, right?\n\n497\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.510\nThat's altitude.\n\n498\n00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:40.370\nSo you have a lot of tracking systems,\na lot of software.\n\n499\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.650\nFor instance, I use a Nike run app.\n\n500\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.530\nAnd it kinda tracks where I'm going.\n\n501\n00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.485\nAnd it also tracks my ascent and\ndescent, if you will,\n\n502\n00:25:47.485 --> 00:25:49.489\nhow I'm going uphill and downhill.\n\n503\n00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:50.590\nWell, guess what.\n\n504\n00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.120\nIt's using the barometer to do that.\n\n505\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.410\nIf we go back to my screen, too,\nthere's also a magnetic sensor and\n\n506\n00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.410\na magnetic sensor, right?\n\n507\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.289\nSo if I'm not moving my phone,\nright, if I'm not moving up and down,\n\n508\n00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:07.338\ntilt, left and right, well,\nthen the gyroscope and the accelerometer\n\n509\n00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:12.177\nare doing nothing to track me,\nright, if I'm in just an even plane.\n\n510\n00:26:12.177 --> 00:26:13.580\nSo how do I know that I'm moving north?\n\n511\n00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.280\nHow is it tracking me?\n\n512\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.640\nWell, you could say it's using GPS.\n\n513\n00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.290\nBut GPS is okay when there's movement.\n\n514\n00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.450\nWell, you're doing this off of satellites,\nright?\n\n515\n00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.840\nBut it's also using the magnetic sensor,\n\n516\n00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:32.630\nwhich senses the magnetic polarity of the\nearth to help track where you're going.\n\n517\n00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.407\nGesture sensors, and again,\nwe talked about gestures in other.\n\n518\n00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:38.440\nAnd the last one down here is\ntemperature and humidity test.\n\n519\n00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.836\nRemember, one of the things that I told\nyou is that the operating systems,\n\n520\n00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:46.260\nthey support thermal management, right?\n\n521\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.250\nWell, one of the things in the thermal\nmanagement that you have to keep in mind\n\n522\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:54.120\nis that we don't want our devices to\noverheat, right, cuz what happens?\n\n523\n00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.680\nIf they overheat,\nwe're gonna damage the device.\n\n524\n00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.280\nWell, it's got a humidity and\na temperature sensor in it.\n\n525\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.120\nAnd what'll happen is, if you put\nyour device in a bright sunlight and\n\n526\n00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.705\nthat heat rises,\nlet alone some of the moisture,\n\n527\n00:27:07.705 --> 00:27:10.480\nit'll go into a thermal shutdown,\nprotecting itself.\n\n528\n00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.923\nI've actually done this.\n&gt;&gt; I did it the first week I had this S8.\n\n529\n00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:12.733\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n\n530\n00:27:12.733 --> 00:27:13.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we went to Disney.\n\n531\n00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:15.630\nI left it in the car on accident.\n\n532\n00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.895\nI come back, that joker was scald-you hot.\n\n533\n00:27:18.895 --> 00:27:20.585\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and the iPads-\n&gt;&gt; And it was gone.\n\n534\n00:27:20.585 --> 00:27:21.685\n&gt;&gt; The iPads have them, too.\n\n535\n00:27:21.685 --> 00:27:25.540\nAnd let me tell you why, because I was\nactually using mine as a navigation.\n\n536\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:31.077\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And I had it, In the cup holder.\n\n537\n00:27:31.077 --> 00:27:33.710\n&gt;&gt; It was in the direct sunlight.\n\n538\n00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.980\n&gt;&gt; And it was, and it was coming through.\n\n539\n00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.520\nAnd all of a sudden, on the iPad,\n\n540\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.435\nyou'll get this massive triangle\nwith an exclamation point.\n\n541\n00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:41.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it'll shut itself down.\n\n542\n00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.431\n&gt;&gt; It said, you done me dirty.\n\n543\n00:27:42.431 --> 00:27:42.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n544\n00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:44.543\n&gt;&gt; I think I wanna sleep, [LAUGH].\n\n545\n00:27:44.543 --> 00:27:46.420\n&gt;&gt; And\nit says something like thermal warning.\n\n546\n00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:51.186\nI can't remember, but I'm not about to do\nit again to a 900 to $1,000 device just to\n\n547\n00:27:51.186 --> 00:27:52.787\nshow you what that looks like.\n\n548\n00:27:52.787 --> 00:27:55.360\nSo those are some of\nthe things that you can do.\n\n549\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.391\nAnd again, maybe some of the calibrations\nof the screen like I was showing you,\n\n550\n00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:04.990\ntoo, with things like TSP Hovering,\nas well as the touchscreen, too.\n\n551\n00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.610\nBut again, a lot of these things,\nyou don't really get to do.\n\n552\n00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.857\nLet me show you one more thing with screen\ncalibration here on my screen here,\n\n553\n00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:13.310\ntouchscreen.\n\n554\n00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.300\nNow, this is a difference.\n\n555\n00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.870\nI'm not actually hovering this time.\n\n556\n00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:21.250\nI actually have to make contact\nwith the phone to pass this test.\n\n557\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.020\nSo it shows me that you can make\nphysical contact with the phone.\n\n558\n00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.100\nSo you can do things\nlike this calibration.\n\n559\n00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.474\nAnd apparently, I don't know how to\ndraw a straight line to save my life.\n\n560\n00:28:30.474 --> 00:28:32.960\nAnd I'm missing some squares there.\n\n561\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.372\nOnce you get done with the squares,\nit says, okay, everything seems good.\n\n562\n00:28:38.372 --> 00:28:40.940\nAll right, so that's some of\nthe things that you have as well.\n\n563\n00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.394\nKeep in mind, be careful, because some of\nthose codes that you enter can potentially\n\n564\n00:28:46.394 --> 00:28:51.261\ncause you problems with your phone,\nespecially with things like battery.\n\n565\n00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:53.340\nThere is one, and\nI'm not even gonna mention it here.\n\n566\n00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.420\nYou go out and find it out, but be careful\nbecause it'll reset the battery data.\n\n567\n00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.890\nAnd after that, the operating\nsystem might lose the ability to\n\n568\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.205\naccurately track where\nyour battery levels are.\n\n569\n00:29:03.205 --> 00:29:06.650\nSo be careful with some of\nthe field service tests and\n\n570\n00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.050\nthe field codes that you\nmight be able to put in.\n\n571\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.570\nNow, there's a couple of other things\nthat we also need to talk about.\n\n572\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.860\nWe mentioned GPS and geotracking, and\n\n573\n00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.550\nthat's all part of\nthe sensors that are in here.\n\n574\n00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:22.020\nAgain, remember, global positioning\nsystem is just 27 total satellites\n\n575\n00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.297\nthat are triangulated over the earth.\n\n576\n00:29:24.297 --> 00:29:26.560\n24 of them are active at all times.\n\n577\n00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.830\nThree of them are on standby.\n\n578\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.442\nOne goes down, one needs to repair,\nanother one comes online.\n\n579\n00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:35.136\nAnd it basically positions your location\nby doing three of them, triangulation,\n\n580\n00:29:35.136 --> 00:29:36.620\nlike in a constellation.\n\n581\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.170\nGeotracking is basically using that\nsystem to find out where the heck it\n\n582\n00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.080\nis you are, right?\n\n583\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.120\nNow, geolocation, you might hear, too.\n\n584\n00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.245\nYou find this in social media and stuff\nwhen you do, hey, I just posted this from\n\n585\n00:29:50.245 --> 00:29:53.760\nthe coffee shop at the corner of whatever,\nMain and Easy Street.\n\n586\n00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.390\nI'm just using that.\n\n587\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.850\nI heard that on the way in on\na commercial, so I stole that one.\n\n588\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.477\nOther things that you might be able to\ndo as well, things like Wi-Fi calling.\n\n589\n00:30:02.477 --> 00:30:03.828\nIf you can do Wi-Fi calling,\n\n590\n00:30:03.828 --> 00:30:06.430\nthis is a good thing where it\nsaves some of your data plan.\n\n591\n00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.960\nBecause what happens is, when you\ngot a good, strong Wi-Fi signal and\n\n592\n00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.220\nyou're on your Wi-Fi network, your calling\ngoes out through your wireless access\n\n593\n00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.340\npoint rather than over your cellular\nnetwork, like GSM, CDMA, LTE.\n\n594\n00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.223\nI think I got all of them.\n\n595\n00:30:20.223 --> 00:30:21.524\nUTMS is the other one.\n\n596\n00:30:21.524 --> 00:30:25.310\nUMTS, yeah, I think I got that right,\nthat acronym.\n\n597\n00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.773\n[LAUGH] And let me show you.\n\n598\n00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:31.020\nYou can actually set this here, for\ninstance, inside of your phone.\n\n599\n00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:39.100\nAnd I believe, if I go to Connections and\nI go to Wi-Fi, and that's Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n600\n00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.300\nWe don't wanna talk about that right now.\n\n601\n00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.265\nLet's see here.\n\n602\n00:30:42.265 --> 00:30:45.210\nWi-Fi Calling, right there,\nyou can see down at the bottom.\n\n603\n00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.470\nIt is something that you have\nthe ability to do, all right?\n\n604\n00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.740\nAnd I could just turn that on now.\n\n605\n00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.039\nIf I turn this on,\nit might give me an error.\n\n606\n00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.700\nAnd the reason I say that it's gonna\ngive me an error is cuz I don't have.\n\n607\n00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.461\nYeah, it's giving me an error up there\nbecause you have to have a data connection\n\n608\n00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:01.942\nto be able to use Wi-Fi.\n\n609\n00:31:01.942 --> 00:31:04.410\nAnd I don't currently have\na data connection on this one.\n\n610\n00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.780\nAll right, the other things\nthat we need to talk about.\n\n611\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:14.610\nWe need to talk about your virtual\nassistance that you have, right?\n\n612\n00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.747\nYou have things like Ok Google,\n\n613\n00:31:16.747 --> 00:31:21.267\nI know is one that has been inside\nof the Android operating systems.\n\n614\n00:31:21.267 --> 00:31:24.640\niOS device, that has Siri,\nright, you probably see.\n\n615\n00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.537\nIn fact, I can show you Siri here.\n\n616\n00:31:26.537 --> 00:31:30.448\nLet's see if I've got Siri\nset up to do what we want.\n\n617\n00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:32.148\nLooks like I moved that around there.\n\n618\n00:31:32.148 --> 00:31:37.343\nGuys, let me see if I can move that to the\nside, make it a little easier to see here.\n\n619\n00:31:37.343 --> 00:31:40.463\nThere we go.\n\n620\n00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:41.400\nThat's the double-click.\n\n621\n00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.460\nYou don't want the double-click.\n\n622\n00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.731\nI think it's hold.\n\n623\n00:31:43.731 --> 00:31:45.640\nThere we go.\n\n624\n00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.421\n[SOUND] And there we go.\n\n625\n00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:49.373\nShe's listening.\n\n626\n00:31:49.373 --> 00:31:51.182\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You're certainly entitled to\n\n627\n00:31:51.182 --> 00:31:51.848\nthat opinion.\n\n628\n00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:53.530\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you can hear that.\n\n629\n00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.170\nI'm entitled to that opinion, apparently.\n\n630\n00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.302\nBut [SOUND] there we go.\n\n631\n00:31:58.302 --> 00:31:59.836\nJust kinda be quiet there for a second.\n\n632\n00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:03.531\nYou could see Siri, I could talk, and\nI could basically do different things and\n\n633\n00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:06.248\nmove around within the operating\nsystem if I want as well.\n\n634\n00:32:06.248 --> 00:32:09.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nmy S8 has a new assistant called Bixby.\n\n635\n00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:12.377\nNice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I can probably pick it up.\n\n636\n00:32:12.377 --> 00:32:15.350\nIf I say, hey Bixby, yeah, there it goes.\n\n637\n00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sure did, too,\nI could see it in the background.\n\n638\n00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.744\n&gt;&gt; It's like hold on, what do you want?\n\n639\n00:32:18.744 --> 00:32:20.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The other one is,\n\n640\n00:32:20.186 --> 00:32:25.090\nwe wouldn't be doing any justice if we\ndidn't mention Cortana, for Windows.\n\n641\n00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.460\nThose of you who know Halo, I believe,\nis where Cortana was born out of.\n\n642\n00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.382\nSo again, you'll also have Cortana inside\nof your Windows operating systems as well.\n\n643\n00:32:34.382 --> 00:32:39.140\nAll right then, let's see what's left,\nwe got a couple more things here.\n\n644\n00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.610\nLaunchers, you might have the ability\nto do different launchers inside\n\n645\n00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.250\nof your Android operating system-\n&gt;&gt; Wait, so hold on, so\n\n646\n00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.400\nyou mention launcher,\nisn't that basically the GUI?\n\n647\n00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.220\n&gt;&gt; It is, and with launchers, they're just\na little bit different, what it is is,\n\n648\n00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.110\nyou actually got an application that you\ncan install from one of the app sources.\n\n649\n00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:01.590\nAnd it basically wraps itself around your\nGUI, and it'll give you a new theme, like\n\n650\n00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:06.259\nmaking it look like you're on the Starship\nEnterprise, so all your icons will change,\n\n651\n00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:08.247\nand it'll adjust to that-\n&gt;&gt; LCARS.\n\n652\n00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:10.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what we call them, LCARS.\n\n653\n00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.635\n&gt;&gt; LCARS, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember what it stands for,\n\n654\n00:33:11.635 --> 00:33:12.395\nit's light something.\n\n655\n00:33:12.395 --> 00:33:15.618\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, or you could change\nthe theme to a Disney theme or\n\n656\n00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:20.360\nsomething like that, so basically you'll\nsee your icons will now match that theme.\n\n657\n00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.670\nA lot of times,\nwe just go with the default launchers and\n\n658\n00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.140\nthe default graphical user interface.\n\n659\n00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.720\nNext thing I want to mention here is\nemergency notifications, so emergency\n\n660\n00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.690\nnotifications, that's gonna be something\nwhere you get things like AMBER alerts.\n\n661\n00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.370\nYou get critical alerts, that your cell\nphone provider or your cellular provider\n\n662\n00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.160\nhas to support these, and\na lot of them will support these.\n\n663\n00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.070\nLet me go ahead and show you where\nyou can modify those, for instance,\n\n664\n00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.740\ninside of your Android device.\n\n665\n00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.119\nIf I go to messages, and I go to settings,\n\n666\n00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.140\nall right, if you'll scroll down,\nit's usually at the bottom here.\n\n667\n00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.830\nLet me see here, emergency alerts,\nyou'll see right here,\n\n668\n00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:04.340\nlet me bring that to the forefront,\nnotice that we have emergency alerts.\n\n669\n00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:11.780\nWe get into emergency alerts, notice\nthat we have the ability to, let me see\n\n670\n00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.340\nif I can move this over just a little bit\nso we can get that on the screen there.\n\n671\n00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.290\nNotice that if you want to disable these,\nyou can,\n\n672\n00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:23.100\nLike the AMBER alerts, imminent\nsevere alert, imminent extreme alert.\n\n673\n00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.500\nSo you do have the ability, potentially,\n\n674\n00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.530\nto control the emergency\nnotifications that you get.\n\n675\n00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.670\nLast thing that I wanna mention for this\nepisode is gonna be mobile pay systems,\n\n676\n00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.080\nmobile pay services.\n\n677\n00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.040\nThere's quite a few that are out there,\nAndroid Pay is one, and\n\n678\n00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.080\nyou'll probably see that at some\nof your point of sale systems.\n\n679\n00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.850\nI know, for instance,\nyou could set this up in the iPad,\n\n680\n00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:49.009\nif I go back to the iPad here, you'll\nnotice that we can go to settings here.\n\n681\n00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:54.820\nAnd I believe, where is that,\nright there, you'll see Wallet and\n\n682\n00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.900\nApple Pay, and\nI can add a credit card or a debit card.\n\n683\n00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.679\nGiving me the ability, again, to do,\nenter into some kind of mobile payment.\n\n684\n00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:03.323\n&gt;&gt; And it's cool,\n\n685\n00:35:03.323 --> 00:35:06.360\nthese kind of services are becoming\na whole lot more prevalent than they were.\n\n686\n00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.790\nObviously, because people's phones\nare supporting them more and more.\n\n687\n00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:13.210\nWe've got a couple of vending machines\nhere in our break room that I can just\n\n688\n00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:18.220\nwalk up with my phone and do Android Pay,\nor if you have an iPhone, Apple Pay.\n\n689\n00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.735\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's nice because\nthey work over things like NFC,\n\n690\n00:35:20.735 --> 00:35:23.819\nnear field communications, so\nwe already got that built in our phones.\n\n691\n00:35:23.819 --> 00:35:26.841\nTouch it to the device and\nnow I've got me a soda when I want, or\n\n692\n00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:29.650\ntouch it to the device and\nnow I've got me a cup of coffee.\n\n693\n00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.990\nSo it's really nice to have,\nespecially for mobile environments,\n\n694\n00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.130\nI do believe it's one of those things that\njust add a little bit more convenience to\n\n695\n00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.200\nour everyday lives.\n\n696\n00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well,\n\n697\n00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:42.220\nwe've gone through a litany of things that\nyou need to know about mobile devices for\n\n698\n00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.660\nyour A+ exam, so definitely peruse\nthrough them a couple of times.\n\n699\n00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.044\nMake sure you're familiar with\neach one of those things, so\n\n700\n00:35:48.044 --> 00:35:50.379\nthat if any questions come up\nwhen it comes to the exam time,\n\n701\n00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:53.347\nyou're not lost in the dark, going,\nwell, you never talked about this.\n\n702\n00:35:53.347 --> 00:35:56.057\nWe covered it all, it's all there so,\n[LAUGH] good stuff, Wes,\n\n703\n00:35:56.057 --> 00:35:58.130\nwe appreciate your time and\neffort on this show.\n\n704\n00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.991\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And we appreciate\n\n705\n00:35:58.991 --> 00:36:02.360\nyou good folks out there for watching,\nbut looks like we're out of time.\n\n706\n00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.001\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n707\n00:36:05.001 --> 00:36:05.621\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n708\n00:36:05.621 --> 00:36:06.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n709\n00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.900\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n710\n00:36:07.900 -->

00:00:05.903\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:08.279\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.088\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:14.031\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.827\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:17.855\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:21.381\nAnd in today's episode, well, we're\ncontinuing on with more in our A+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:23.071\nCuz that's what you good\nfolks have come to see and\n\n11\n00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:24.770\nthat's what we're delivering today.\n\n12\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.280\nJoining us in the studio to help us out\nwith that, our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.190\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.530\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\n\n15\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.170\ngreat to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250\nThat's right, we are continuing on, and\nwell, our journey through mobile devices.\n\n17\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.635\nOver the last few episodes,\n\n18\n00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.643\nwe've been talking more about\nother technologies, right?\n\n19\n00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:44.617\nThe domain two in your 22902 exam is gonna\nbe about other operating systems and\n\n20\n00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:45.622\ntechnologies.\n\n21\n00:00:45.622 --> 00:00:49.200\nAnd we've been kinda work in\nour way through mobile devices.\n\n22\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.884\nWe had an episode, if you have not seen\nit that we talked about some of the basic\n\n23\n00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:56.538\nfeatures of your mobile operating systems,\nright, your mobile devices.\n\n24\n00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:00.420\nNow, what we'll be talking about in\nthis episode is you can see by the title\n\n25\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.510\nis really a couple of objectives,\nand I've put them together.\n\n26\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.980\nAnd the reason I did that is because\none kind of necessitates the other.\n\n27\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.015\nAnd you'll see that the long title is\nMobile Device Connectivity Email and\n\n28\n00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.010\nSyncing.\n\n29\n00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.930\nSo let me help you out here, those of you\nladies and gentlemen that are looking for\n\n30\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.900\nspecific objectives.\n\n31\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.329\nCuz hey, those objectives are gonna be\nwhat you need to know to pass the exam.\n\n32\n00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.759\nThis is 2.6, right?\n\n33\n00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.308\nThis is gonna be installing and\n\n34\n00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:28.760\nconfiguring basic mobile device\nnetwork connectivity and email, right?\n\n35\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.090\nEmail is definitely important, right?\n\n36\n00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.283\nNetwork connections are obviously\ngonna be important to have email.\n\n37\n00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:36.690\nBut this is also gonna be about\nexplaining the different data types and\n\n38\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.126\nsynchronization methods\nthat we have out there.\n\n39\n00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:43.511\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and because\nnetworking is required basically to do\n\n40\n00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:48.240\nemail and to do data synchronization,\nI went ahead and said hey, let's go ahead.\n\n41\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.280\nLet's keep all of this\ninto a single basket\n\n42\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.518\nthat we have it in basically\na single location.\n\n43\n00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:58.580\nAll right, so, diving into it, one of\nthe first things that they talk about,\n\n44\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.380\nwell, are our network connections, right?\n\n45\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.805\nThe network connections that we're\ntalking about is the wireless or\n\n46\n00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:06.110\nWi-Fi communications,\nas well as your cellular communications.\n\n47\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.100\nAnd what they call out is wireless\ncellular data networks and\n\n48\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.100\nenable and disable.\n\n49\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.920\nSo if we take a look at my screen here\nthere's a couple different ways that you\n\n50\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.470\ncan do this.\n\n51\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.840\nLike, for instance, I could if I wanted\nto, you'll see that on my Android device\n\n52\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.990\nover here, the Wi-Fi right there is,\nwell, it's enabled.\n\n53\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.490\nAnd I could push the button and\nguess what?\n\n54\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.790\nIt's disabled.\n\n55\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.842\nAnd well, I could push the button again,\nand it's enabled, right?\n\n56\n00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:31.084\n&gt;&gt; It's that simple.\n\n57\n00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.375\n&gt;&gt; It really is, right?\n\n58\n00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.520\nAnd then if I go to,\nlet's do cellular communications.\n\n59\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.144\nI gotta be careful on this one.\n\n60\n00:02:37.144 --> 00:02:38.631\nIf I disable the wireless communication,\n\n61\n00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.416\nI won't be able to communicate\nwith the iPad here.\n\n62\n00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:43.360\nSo we'll go ahead and\ngo to cellular connections.\n\n63\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.160\nAnd you can see that the Cellular Data,\nit's actually turned on, right?\n\n64\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.210\nAnd well, that's just as simple as,\nwell, turning it off.\n\n65\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.610\nAll right, case dismissed,\nmoving on, right?\n\n66\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.230\nWell, just kidding guys and\ngals out there.\n\n67\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.070\nWe're not gonna leave you.\n\n68\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.850\nIt really is that simple,\njust like Dan said.\n\n69\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.700\nBut let's go ahead and talk a little\nbit more about the communication.\n\n70\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.930\nAnd one of the things that we need to\nknow, if we dive back into our view here,\n\n71\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.220\nI wanna go a little bit farther than that.\n\n72\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.600\nQuite literally, it's that easy to\nenable a wireless communication,\n\n73\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.890\ndisable wireless communication, enable\na cellular communication, and disable it.\n\n74\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.000\nBut we wanna show you a little bit more\nabout the settings behind the scenes.\n\n75\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.670\nSo if I go to Settings here in my Android\ndevice, or Settings here in the iPad.\n\n76\n00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.260\nSo you guys can just see\nthat from beginning to end.\n\n77\n00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.122\nNotice then, I have Wi-Fi here, right?\n\n78\n00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:33.712\nIn the iPad, I've got Wi-Fi here.\n\n79\n00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:37.651\nAnd, well, these are the series of\navailable wireless networks, right?\n\n80\n00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:41.890\nWe've talked about wireless\nin other shows here, right?\n\n81\n00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.360\nAgain, the wireless access points or\nnetworks are broadcasting their SSIDs.\n\n82\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.696\nAnd we can see what those\nnetwork names are, right?\n\n83\n00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.360\nAnd you can also see that currently,\n\n84\n00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.810\nI'm connected to the ITProTV\nnetwork here within our building.\n\n85\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.470\nI could see, relative,\nkinda what the signal strength is.\n\n86\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.050\nAnd you can also see signal strength\nup here on the top of the iPad as well.\n\n87\n00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.937\nI know it's kinda,\ngot a little blurry there but\n\n88\n00:04:06.937 --> 00:04:09.973\nyou can see that we do have\nwireless connectivity.\n\n89\n00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:13.859\nNow, if I wanna know a little bit\nmore about the network, right, and\n\n90\n00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.604\nI can choose the network here.\n\n91\n00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:19.025\nAnd then I can get into, well, some of\nthe configurations that we have, right?\n\n92\n00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.745\nI can see my IP address.\n\n93\n00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:25.359\nI can see that I'm a 10.0.10.177.\n\n94\n00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:27.103\nI can see what the subnet mask is.\n\n95\n00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:29.030\nI can see what the,\nin this case, the router.\n\n96\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.495\nDon't let that confuse you,\n\n97\n00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:33.490\nthose of you who that have made\nit through our 901 series.\n\n98\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.410\nWe talk about a router,\nthat's our default gateway.\n\n99\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.520\nAnd the name servers that we use,\nDNS, Domain Name System, right?\n\n100\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.160\nThe DNS servers that we use for\nname resolution out here.\n\n101\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.530\nAll right, so that's essentially where\nyou could do this inside of the iPad.\n\n102\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.011\nNow, I do want you to understand\nthat if we look at the screen here,\n\n103\n00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.943\nyou can manually set these.\n\n104\n00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:56.430\nLet me see here if I\ncan switch over there.\n\n105\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.500\nI'm not gonna manually set up myself but\nIf you wanted to, you could, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.850\nI'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna leave these.\n\n107\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.890\nI'm gonna turn all of this off, right?\n\n108\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.220\nStatic addresses up here,\nI could set all of these.\n\n109\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.710\nThat's actually the HTTP proxy.\n\n110\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.620\nI don't wanna set a proxy.\n\n111\n00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.420\nBut I could if I wanted to.\n\n112\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.200\nI could come in here and\nI could define a static IP address.\n\n113\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.580\nAnd you can see that it's a static.\n\n114\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.350\nRemember we've talked about what DHCP\nis versus what static addressing is.\n\n115\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.170\nDon't worry about BootP.\n\n116\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.320\nBootP is, well, it's actually\nthe predecessor of the DHCP there.\n\n117\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.070\nThey're really a lot alike.\n\n118\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.560\nThey're very similar.\n\n119\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.330\nBut a lot of times, what we use BootP for\nis to install operating systems.\n\n120\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.472\nAnd thin clients use that\nto connect to a server and\n\n121\n00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.053\npull down their operating systems.\n\n122\n00:05:38.053 --> 00:05:41.569\nBut that's a little bit beyond\nthe scope of what we're doing here, and\n\n123\n00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.801\nmore importantly, a little bit\nbeyond the scope of the A+ exam.\n\n124\n00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes, how do you go as far as\nto say that whole thing where it says,\n\n125\n00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:48.358\nforget this networks?\n\n126\n00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:51.540\nProbably one of the most important buttons\non that screen, to be honest with you.\n\n127\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.150\nBecause a lot of times\nthese mobile devices,\n\n128\n00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.060\nthey're bouncing from network\nto network to network.\n\n129\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.030\nAnd sometimes either a setting changes or\njust some inconsistency occurs and\n\n130\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.150\nthings don't work correctly.\n\n131\n00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.710\nSo a good way to get that kind\nof thing troubleshooted and\n\n132\n00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.440\nfixed is by forgetting a network entirely.\n\n133\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.710\nAnd let it re-find it and then try\nconnecting, just start from scratch.\n\n134\n00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.220\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n135\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.814\nAnd I want you guys to put a little\nbookmark in what Dan said.\n\n136\n00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:19.791\nBecause when we get into\nsecurity in mobile devices,\n\n137\n00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.380\nthat is one of the security\nvulnerabilities.\n\n138\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.325\nAnd that's unintended connections and\nthat happens sometimes.\n\n139\n00:06:25.325 --> 00:06:28.340\nAnd you might say, well,\nwait a second, unintended connection?\n\n140\n00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.050\nWell, you might have multiple wireless\nnetworks that you're connecting to and\n\n141\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.780\nyou accidentally connected\nto the wrong one.\n\n142\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.630\nNow, it doesn't mean somebody\nis taking over your computer.\n\n143\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.305\nBut it does cause availability issues,\nand when we talk about security,\n\n144\n00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:41.635\nwe talk about availability.\n\n145\n00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:46.405\nNow, if we switch on over to the Android\nside of this, we'll go ahead and\n\n146\n00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.105\nlook at my screen here real quick.\n\n147\n00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:51.070\nNotice that we also have\nWi-Fi here as well.\n\n148\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.910\nAll right, and with WiFi,\nwe can go ahead and we can click that.\n\n149\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.320\nAnd when we click that, notice that I am\nalso connected to the ITProTV network.\n\n150\n00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.770\nNow, I can't do this really with the iPad.\n\n151\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.450\nCuz I'm actually using a wireless\nconnection to show you guys the iPad here\n\n152\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.590\non my desktop.\n\n153\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.440\nBut I can do this cuz I'm actually\ntethered directly with a cable\n\n154\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.810\nwith the Android device.\n\n155\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.094\nAnd notice if I choose the actual network,\nlet me cancel that and show you.\n\n156\n00:07:19.094 --> 00:07:23.160\nAll I'm doing does pressing on\nthe network that I'm connected to.\n\n157\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.910\nNotice what, remember what Dan was saying.\n\n158\n00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.989\nThis is also very important.\n\n159\n00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:29.859\nSo it's good since he mentioned it, we'll\ngo ahead and we'll keep it consistent.\n\n160\n00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:33.160\nWe'll mentioned it inside\nof Android as well.\n\n161\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.410\nNotice the Forget option right here?\n\n162\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.360\nThat might be something that you wanna do.\n\n163\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.642\nIf you wanna connect to a different\nnetwork and you don't want an unintended\n\n164\n00:07:40.642 --> 00:07:43.720\nconnection, well, you just forget it or\nif there's a communication issue.\n\n165\n00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.960\nOne of the communication issues that\nI could see is a security mismatch.\n\n166\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.205\nIf somebody changes the password on,\nessentially,\n\n167\n00:07:50.205 --> 00:07:54.687\nthe network that you're connected to,\nit still remembers the network.\n\n168\n00:07:54.687 --> 00:07:58.795\nAnd when you come in here, what you'll\nnotice is that it no longer says, oop,\n\n169\n00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:00.681\nI do not want to connect to that one.\n\n170\n00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.821\nLet me go ahead and dismiss that.\n\n171\n00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:04.353\nCancel, there we go.\n\n172\n00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:07.900\nJiminy Cricket actually, I don't know what\nyou would say with a touch screen, right.\n\n173\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.260\nNotice that it does say connected.\n\n174\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.960\nIf it says, no IP address or\nnot connected or authentication\n\n175\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.020\nissues, that might be a time when you\nhave to do exactly what Dan said.\n\n176\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.000\nClick the network interface or\nthe network that you're connected to and\n\n177\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.060\nchoose forget and notice that\nI'm no longer connected, right.\n\n178\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.590\nI can see that even though the wireless\nadapter in the settings here is turned on,\n\n179\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.780\nI no longer have a connection.\n\n180\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.540\nIn this case, what I need to do is I need\nto find the one in the list that I want to\n\n181\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.112\ngo to, in this list,\nit's going to be back to the same one.\n\n182\n00:08:44.112 --> 00:08:51.040\nITPro.TV right, and let's go ahead and get\nthrough that, dismiss that all together.\n\n183\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.240\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'll go ahead and\nconnect to it.\n\n184\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.190\nAll right now, when I connect to this all\nI'm doing is entering the password here\n\n185\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.380\nand you'll see that we've kind of\ngot the password offscreen there,\n\n186\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.819\nthat is for a reason.\n\n187\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.560\nAll right, and let me go ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.400\nreal quick just finish\nthe authentication again.\n\n189\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.120\nLike I said ladies and gentlemen,\nall I'm doing here is trying to enter this\n\n190\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.940\npassword here and you guys that have been\nwith me long enough now through this\n\n191\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.400\nseries know that, that is a very,\nvery technical thing for me.\n\n192\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.041\nYou might have see that [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:28.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's said obtaining IP address and\n\n194\n00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:30.390\nthen it said connected.\n\n195\n00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.252\nNow we're reconnected to that device so\n\n196\n00:09:32.252 --> 00:09:35.180\nthat's the process that Dan\nmentioned from beginning to end.\n\n197\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.190\nFor getting a network and\nthen reconnecting to it.\n\n198\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.470\nSo and we'll also talk about that and\nsome connection issues to it as well.\n\n199\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.640\nWe already mentioned that here, but\n\n200\n00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.180\nyou know it's a great point to go\nahead an mention that right here.\n\n201\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.426\nAll right, so\nnow we also have cellular networks too.\n\n202\n00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd cellular networks,\nare typically something that for\n\n203\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.053\nthe most part you don't control.\n\n204\n00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:58.342\nAnd what I mean by that is you go to\na carrier and whatever the carrier is that\n\n205\n00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:02.130\nyou have, they're the ones that have the\ninfrastructure that you pay them a price.\n\n206\n00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.660\nThey're no different than an ISP, right?\n\n207\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.010\nIs your Internet service provider\nusing a sonic back plane, right?\n\n208\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.265\nAre they using metro Ethernet?\n\n209\n00:10:10.265 --> 00:10:13.610\nWell, that's really not up to you\nwhether they're using fiber or\n\n210\n00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.450\nwhat type of network it is right there,\nyou're just paying them a service.\n\n211\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:21.010\nSo I do want you to understand that when\nit comes to the cellular connections,\n\n212\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.020\nthe cellular data network, you have to\nkind of do your research, you know.\n\n213\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.900\nAnd to some people it doesn't matter.\n\n214\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.940\nBut, I wanna go ahead and\n\n215\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.720\njust kind of talk briefly about\nsome of the options that you have.\n\n216\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.910\nIf we go back to the screen here, you'll\nnotice that, let me back out of here,\n\n217\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:39.860\nyou'll notice that I have this option\nhere of more networks right, in Android.\n\n218\n00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:46.290\nAll right, I can also look at cellular\ndata over here on our iPad, right.\n\n219\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.460\nSo, in my settings menu here, and\n\n220\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.430\nthey talk about cellular data options,\nwe can go to cellular,\n\n221\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.120\nlet me go ahead and see if that'll go in\nthere, notice that we have a sim, right.\n\n222\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.130\nYour security information management,\nI think is what that means and.\n\n223\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.210\nYou got your sim card, right?\n\n224\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.310\nYour sim cards are typically\non GSM networks,\n\n225\n00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.270\nbut understand that you can\nalso gain access to your,\n\n226\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.930\nthe technologies here in your Android\ndevice by going to more networks.\n\n227\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.010\nAlright, then mobile networks and\nyou can see the network mode.\n\n228\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.510\nAnd I just wanna briefly talk\nabout the options that you have.\n\n229\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.344\nLike I said,\nthis is because you can control,\n\n230\n00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:30.032\nyou could control the mode\nthat it works in,\n\n231\n00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:34.771\nbut that's not gonna be something that\nyou can control with the ISP, right.\n\n232\n00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:38.922\nThe ISP is that the provider AT&amp;T,\nmight use something different, and\n\n233\n00:11:38.922 --> 00:11:43.018\na lot of times they do AT&amp;T use\nsomething different over like Verizon.\n\n234\n00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:45.710\nBut I do just want you to be aware\nof the different technologies.\n\n235\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.090\nYou have your long-term evolution,\ncode-division multiple access or CDMA and\n\n236\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.310\nglobal systems mobile, right?\n\n237\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.270\nThose are your three\nprevalent options today,\n\n238\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.473\nnow a lot of times you just go ahead and\nyou leave it auto connect and this says,\n\n239\n00:11:59.473 --> 00:12:05.220\nhey let the phone detect what it is, and\nwe really don't have to worry about that.\n\n240\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.810\nSo I did just wanna kinda of mention\nthat you do have access to that\n\n241\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.970\noption right there, but for the most\npart so whatever your ISP is giving you,\n\n242\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.330\njust leave those settings the way you've\ngot when you brought the phone, right, and\n\n243\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.170\nyou should be good.\n\n244\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.900\nNow, the next thing that we\nhave to talk about briefly\n\n245\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.470\nis what's known as a hotspot or tethering.\n\n246\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:30.180\nAll right, now a lot of times they give\nclose to the same functionality but\n\n247\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.492\nhow they achieve it's\na little bit differently.\n\n248\n00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:35.640\nAll right, when we talk about a hotspot,\na hotspot is taking your phone and\n\n249\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.270\nturning it into kind of\nlike a wireless router.\n\n250\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.126\nRight, it allows it to do things like\nDHCP, perform network address translation.\n\n251\n00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:46.164\nYeah, it really kind of harkens back\nto the earlier days when we were doing\n\n252\n00:12:46.164 --> 00:12:48.230\nInternet connection\nsharing within computers.\n\n253\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.260\nRight, I have one connection up down to\nthe Internet but all I was allowed and\n\n254\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.090\nthis is before the reverence of\nyour home routers and stuff.\n\n255\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.180\nToday they are so cheap that we don't\neven really a lot of times worry about\n\n256\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.120\nInternet connection sharing\non our home networks.\n\n257\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.460\nBut what happens if you\nbring your device out?\n\n258\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.989\nAnd let's say Dan's got his phone or\nhis mobile device out there and\n\n259\n00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.671\nhe says, you know what?\n\n260\n00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:15.050\nYou need a connection,\nyou just need to download that little,\n\n261\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.640\nI don't know, so\nmany k file to fix your phone or whatever.\n\n262\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.200\nWell let me go ahead and\nput my phone in a hotspot mode and\n\n263\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.430\nguess what, you can connect to the\nInternet over my carrier through my phone.\n\n264\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.958\n&gt;&gt; And I think really saves you a lot of\ntime, cuz maybe you're maybe you are in\n\n265\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.758\na spot where there is just no\nopen wireless access for you and\n\n266\n00:13:31.758 --> 00:13:34.185\nyou are like men,\nI got do that firewall uploaded.\n\n267\n00:13:34.185 --> 00:13:39.086\nI've got a presentation and\nI've gotta do or I'm gonna be long in\n\n268\n00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:44.140\nthis web based whatever and\nwatch an online something or other.\n\n269\n00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.749\nI got nothing, what am I gonna do?\n\n270\n00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:49.330\nWell you plus your phone, almost everybody\nhas got a phone on them that has well,\n\n271\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.660\ncellular access.\n\n272\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.520\nBoom, turn it into a wireless hotspot and\ngo right to town.\n\n273\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.730\nIt's a very handy feature, definitely.\n\n274\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.070\n&gt;&gt; And the other one is tethering.\n\n275\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.558\nNow tethering is a little bit different.\n\n276\n00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:02.770\nAgain the that kind of the concept\nof what you are doing the end result\n\n277\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.290\nis close to the same.\n\n278\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.530\nBut I'm careful on how I say that, because\ntethering is typically a signal device.\n\n279\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.500\nWhere a mobile hotspot allows\nmultiple devices potentially up to\n\n280\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.473\nten a lot of times to\nconnect out to the Internet.\n\n281\n00:14:14.473 --> 00:14:19.160\nHowever, you are letting another devices\nthe similarity, you are letting another\n\n282\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.550\ndevice go through your connection and\nconnect outbound to the Internet.\n\n283\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.102\nSo for instance in tethering,\nI'm gonna use a cable, right?\n\n284\n00:14:26.102 --> 00:14:31.820\nI'm gonna use a cable and\nI'm gonna plug it into my laptop, right?\n\n285\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.500\nOr maybe even from a tablet to your phone,\nright?\n\n286\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.200\nAnd then that device through that\ncable is gonna piggyback off and\n\n287\n00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.240\nbe able to make a connection.\n\n288\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.159\nLike I said, one of the big differences is\nthat the hotspot allows mobile devices,\n\n289\n00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:46.672\nand even more so,\nsometimes when you have a mobile device,\n\n290\n00:14:46.672 --> 00:14:50.416\nwhat you'll end up having, or\nI'm sorry, a mobile hotspot.\n\n291\n00:14:50.416 --> 00:14:53.380\nYou'll sometimes from the carrier\nget a mobile hotspot box,\n\n292\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.427\ncompletely separate right, so understand\nthat this could be, and let me show you,\n\n293\n00:14:57.427 --> 00:15:00.280\nthis could be a functionality\nthat is built into the phone.\n\n294\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.640\nIn fact, let me kind of get back\nto our home screen so you guys,\n\n295\n00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.850\nif they ask you on the exam\nthey love step by steps here.\n\n296\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.466\nI just go to settings here.\n\n297\n00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:09.020\nGo to more networks here inside.\n\n298\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.680\n&gt;&gt; I wish those questions were.\n\n299\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.220\nHow do you turn on tethering\ninstead of your phone?\n\n300\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.508\nI go to Google, and\nthey read the directions, and I do that.\n\n301\n00:15:17.508 --> 00:15:18.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Google.com, that's right.\n\n302\n00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:20.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that should be the answer.\n\n303\n00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:23.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n304\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.360\nSo as you can see here, and our heads\nare kinda covering it up right now.\n\n305\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.860\nBut you can see we have the tethering,\nand the mobile hotspot here as well.\n\n306\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.480\nThat is something that you do have,\nthat you can gain access to.\n\n307\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.050\nGo ahead and also mention,\nwhile we're right here and\n\n308\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.570\nyou guys can see this, we have a couple of\nother types of connections that we wanna\n\n309\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.950\njust briefly mention.\n\n310\n00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.570\nAirplane mode.\n\n311\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.333\nAirplane mode you can see is at the top,\nover here on my.\n\n312\n00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:52.063\nYou'll see over here on my iPad Airplane\nmode is on the top of the settings and\n\n313\n00:15:52.063 --> 00:15:53.129\nI could turn that on.\n\n314\n00:15:53.129 --> 00:15:56.229\nI'm not gonna turn that on the iPod,\nbecause what it does,\n\n315\n00:15:56.229 --> 00:15:58.348\nit kills all the transceivers, right?\n\n316\n00:15:58.348 --> 00:16:03.078\nReceiver, transceivers combination\nof transmitter receiver, right?\n\n317\n00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:05.372\nAnd [LAUGH] there's a debate on this one,\nbut\n\n318\n00:16:05.372 --> 00:16:09.464\nyou're supposed to put your phones on\nAirplane mode when you are taking off and\n\n319\n00:16:09.464 --> 00:16:12.010\ntaxiing on the runway,\nthey'll tell you that.\n\n320\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:16.420\nNow, I've always said if my little $800\nphone can bring down a multi-million\n\n321\n00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.170\ndollar plane, they need to do a little\nbit better when it comes to their\n\n322\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.585\nwireless communications, but I'm joking,\njoking aside guys that's just my little.\n\n323\n00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:30.119\nAirplane mode though in to be safe and\nsecure, you make sure that when you're\n\n324\n00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:34.792\ntaxing the runway, at a certain point,\nmaybe even before you taxi the runway,\n\n325\n00:16:34.792 --> 00:16:39.502\nyou turn that on Airplane mode and it\ndisables all of the wireless connections.\n\n326\n00:16:39.502 --> 00:16:43.174\nAnd when I wireless, I'm not just\ntalking about things like your Wi-Fi,\n\n327\n00:16:43.174 --> 00:16:45.985\nI also talking about your\ncellular communications too.\n\n328\n00:16:45.985 --> 00:16:48.161\nSo you can see a couple different places.\n\n329\n00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:53.700\nIn fact, you can see here, it's just\nas simple as a click of a button.\n\n330\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.714\nNotice what it tells you here, allows\nyou to turn off calling, messaging and\n\n331\n00:16:57.714 --> 00:17:02.000\ndata network features, also turns off\nconnectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\n\n332\n00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.132\nSo all of your wireless communications,\nand I mean wireless in the true\n\n333\n00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:11.860\nsense that all radios will be\ntemporarily disabled, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.100\nSo we're go ahead and chose OK to that and\nnow Airplane mode is on, right?\n\n335\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.400\nSo we can see it very,\nvery simple to do that.\n\n336\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.592\nThe other thing that you might have\nto do is you might have to make and\n\n337\n00:17:21.592 --> 00:17:25.376\nI'm gonna go ahead and say OK to this,\nyou might have to make a VPN connection.\n\n338\n00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:27.579\nRemember, a VPN is\na Virtual Private Network.\n\n339\n00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:31.637\nIt allows me to take this, for\ninstance, this mobile device and\n\n340\n00:17:31.637 --> 00:17:36.920\nI can connect over a public network into\na corporate network in a protected manner.\n\n341\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.480\nIt uses a combination of tunneling and\nencryption, essentially,\n\n342\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.790\ntreating my public\nconnection as a virtualized\n\n343\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.800\npoint to point connection\nbetween two end points.\n\n344\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.310\nWhich one of the end points will be here,\nmy phone.\n\n345\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.972\nThe other end point there would\nbe the corporate network.\n\n346\n00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:56.417\nAnd we couple that with security\ntechniques known as encryption that takes\n\n347\n00:17:56.417 --> 00:18:00.440\nall of that data that's moving across\nthat virtualized point to point network.\n\n348\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.010\nAnd essentially,\nscrambling it on a way that say if Dan\n\n349\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.350\nout there has got his black hat on\ntoday rather than the white hat,\n\n350\n00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.520\nhe won't be able to see the information\neven if he can gain access to it, so\n\n351\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.430\nit does a couple different levels there.\n\n352\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.910\nBut we could set up things like our VPNs\nand you can see there's advanced VPN.\n\n353\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.821\nDo not worry about things like IPsec, I\nwould say, at this point in your training.\n\n354\n00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:24.506\nIf those of you that are going on to\nNetwork+ might have to start being\n\n355\n00:18:24.506 --> 00:18:27.120\nintroduced to\nthe Internet Protocol Security suite.\n\n356\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.360\nBut we can set up things like basic VPNs\nand then essentially, I could connect.\n\n357\n00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.310\nBut I'm not gonna set up a VPN here,\nbut just know that you can do that.\n\n358\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.160\nCuz the actual VPN set up itself\nis a little bit, I would say,\n\n359\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.738\nbeyond the scope of the exam.\n\n360\n00:18:42.738 --> 00:18:45.240\nKnow what the VPN is,\nknow that you have those capabilities,\n\n361\n00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.760\nbecause think about it.\n\n362\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.860\nYou use mobile devices in a corporate\nenvironment all the time, right?\n\n363\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.580\nI mean, that’s why we have new acronyms\nthat maybe you guys have heard about if\n\n364\n00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.450\nnot we'll mention it in mobile devices.\n\n365\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.100\nI don't even know if I've said this yet,\nbut I really should, BYOD.\n\n366\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.580\nBring your own device, right?\n\n367\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.160\nThat means that I want the ability\nthat I have my own device.\n\n368\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.740\nI want to gain access to\nmy corporate information.\n\n369\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.650\nI want to send information back and\nforth from myself to Dan.\n\n370\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.550\nI want to have access to my email.\n\n371\n00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.232\nWe also want to make sure that if you're\naccessing your corporate networks and\n\n372\n00:19:17.232 --> 00:19:20.466\nlet's say Dan's the administrator and\nhe's got a file server set up\n\n373\n00:19:20.466 --> 00:19:24.090\non the corporate side and\nI've got my mobile device, right?\n\n374\n00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.500\nI certainly don't wanna be on a coffee\nshop hotspot where everybody can see my\n\n375\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.180\ninformation, connect back over that public\nconnection in the server that he set up\n\n376\n00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.800\nand download a corporate file\nover that public network.\n\n377\n00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.580\n&gt;&gt; What's wrong with that Wes?\n\n378\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.135\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n379\n00:19:36.135 --> 00:19:39.527\n[LAUGH] And this give me the ability or\nDan as an administrator,\n\n380\n00:19:39.527 --> 00:19:41.885\nprobably he would be\nthe one setting it up.\n\n381\n00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:43.159\nI wouldn't even be setting it up.\n\n382\n00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:47.618\nA lot of times as the end user to\nset up that secure communication\n\n383\n00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:50.901\nbetween my device and\nthe corporate network so\n\n384\n00:19:50.901 --> 00:19:55.046\nthat people can't gain\nunauthorized access to the data.\n\n385\n00:19:55.046 --> 00:19:56.666\nAll right, last but not least,\n\n386\n00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:59.486\nlooks like we might have to go\ninto a part two on this one.\n\n387\n00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:03.446\nBut last but not least, one last\nthing that I want to mention since\n\n388\n00:20:03.446 --> 00:20:07.492\nwe're in the realm of the wireless\ncommunications is Bluetooth.\n\n389\n00:20:07.492 --> 00:20:11.590\nBluetooth, a very easy,\nshort range communication.\n\n390\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.690\nVery simplistic to set up.\n\n391\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.123\nYou can do this just as simple\nas a click of a button.\n\n392\n00:20:16.123 --> 00:20:20.019\nAnd sometimes,\nyou actually have to enter a PIN.\n\n393\n00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:20.970\nThey call it a PIN code.\n\n394\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.650\nPersonal identification number.\n\n395\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.943\nAnd sometimes you have these on devices,\n\n396\n00:20:24.943 --> 00:20:28.690\nsometimes you don't have these on\ndevices and let me show you here.\n\n397\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.990\nSo, you could see that I'm still\nin the wireless setting and\n\n398\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.720\nI'd like to go back to the home screen\nhere just so people can see it.\n\n399\n00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.258\nAgain, just in case they ask you\nin an exam environment because A+,\n\n400\n00:20:38.258 --> 00:20:40.027\nall the CompTIA exams are known for\n\n401\n00:20:40.027 --> 00:20:44.360\nwhat are known as performance based\nquestions, which means simulations, right?\n\n402\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.340\nSo you have settings\nhere on the iPad side.\n\n403\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.067\nYou also have settings\nhere on the Android side.\n\n404\n00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:53.770\nAnd notice that we have Bluetooth,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.670\nAnd by default, if I go to Bluetooth,\nthis actually turned it right on, okay?\n\n406\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.230\nSo give it a second here.\n\n407\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.380\nWhat it's gonna do, is it's gonna\nsearch for devices to pair with, right?\n\n408\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.490\nAnd it should find some.\n\n409\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.860\nI'm not sure if it will.\n\n410\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.410\nBut it should,\n\n411\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.690\nbecause we've got a few devices on this\nnetwork, and I'm gonna turn it on.\n\n412\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.210\nAnd there we go.\n\n413\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.250\nWell, it got my MacBook Pro, right?\n\n414\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.579\nSo I can connect potentially,\nand the iPad, so\n\n415\n00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:18.383\nit's interesting that these two devices-\n&gt;&gt; They see each other.\n\n416\n00:21:18.383 --> 00:21:19.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do see each other, right?\n\n417\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.162\nSo it's seeing my MacBook.\n\n418\n00:21:21.162 --> 00:21:22.215\n&gt;&gt; Fancy meeting you here.\n\n419\n00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:22.858\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n420\n00:21:22.858 --> 00:21:25.860\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] come\nto the dark side, yeah.\n\n421\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.670\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanted to, what we could\ndo is we can pair these devices up.\n\n422\n00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:35.080\nAnd they would have to enter into\na trust relationship, where basically,\n\n423\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.740\nyou do this bit with\nthings like headphones.\n\n424\n00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.723\nYou do this thing with wireless keyboards,\nwireless speakers, if you will.\n\n425\n00:21:42.723 --> 00:21:44.570\nAnd you go through the pairing process.\n\n426\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.040\nYou enable it, which enables it for\npairing, if you will.\n\n427\n00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.060\nYou find the device like\nwe've just seen for pairing,\n\n428\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.280\nyou would click on the device.\n\n429\n00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.920\nLet me go ahead and see if I can do this.\n\n430\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.870\nWe'll pair this up.\n\n431\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.240\nNotice that it's trying to pair up.\n\n432\n00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.290\nNotice there is a pairing request on\nthe iPad here, it's letting me know,\n\n433\n00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.370\nhey, it wants to pair up.\n\n434\n00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.450\nNotice the confirmation code.\n\n435\n00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:11.599\nIt tells me the confirmation code is and\n\n436\n00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:16.767\nI know that's a little blurry, 868148.\n\n437\n00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:18.050\nAll right, so there it is.\n\n438\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.780\nAnd all I'd have to do is\ncompare those two codes.\n\n439\n00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:26.010\nLet me go ahead and show you that it just\nlet me know that on the Android side,\n\n440\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.740\nI do have that code there.\n\n441\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.068\nSo you realize and verify that, hey, yes.\n\n442\n00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:33.597\nI'll hit OK, and I'll pick,\nit says unsuccessful.\n\n443\n00:22:33.597 --> 00:22:34.913\nI didn't hit it in time on the iPad.\n\n444\n00:22:34.913 --> 00:22:37.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But that would be the pairing process.\n\n445\n00:22:37.005 --> 00:22:38.910\nAnd I really don't have\nany reason to pair these.\n\n446\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.102\nBut you could see very easily that\nyou could pair these devices up but\n\n447\n00:22:42.102 --> 00:22:44.294\nnow they can communicate\nbetween each other.\n\n448\n00:22:44.294 --> 00:22:47.002\n&gt;&gt; And\nactually because it took you a little time\n\n449\n00:22:47.002 --> 00:22:50.716\nto try to pair those two things,\na built in security feature.\n\n450\n00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:54.300\nIf you go beyond a very short span of\ntime and you haven't paired it up, well,\n\n451\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.885\nthen we are stopping the process because\nmaybe this is some sought of attack or\n\n452\n00:22:57.885 --> 00:22:58.880\nsomething.\n\n453\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.255\nIf you're standing right there pairing\ndevices, it shouldn't take you too long.\n\n454\n00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:06.787\nAnd that's the assumption behind there if\nyou're maybe doing something malicious,\n\n455\n00:23:06.787 --> 00:23:08.773\nit could take you a little bit longer so\n\n456\n00:23:08.773 --> 00:23:12.680\nthey try to help mitigate that\nkind of stuff using that timeout.\n\n457\n00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan.\nAnd one of the things that you never want\n\n458\n00:23:14.573 --> 00:23:17.583\nto do is leave any kind of wireless\nconnection that's unused, well,\n\n459\n00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:18.360\nbasically open.\n\n460\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.550\nEspecially when it comes to Bluetooth,\n\n461\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.070\nbecause there are probably\na number of things.\n\n462\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.100\nI can think of Bluesnarfing and\nBluejacking, right?\n\n463\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.800\nThat these attacks that people\ncould get onto your computer.\n\n464\n00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.880\nSo definitely do what he says.\n\n465\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.816\nWell, that's why it's built in really\nwhen it comes down to it is that it\n\n466\n00:23:33.816 --> 00:23:36.140\nwill disconnect automatically.\n\n467\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.230\nNow I didn't actually get to test it,\nso let's go back and let me show you,\n\n468\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:45.020\nI'm actually gonna take my iPad, I'm\ngonna pair it with my Macbook Pro here.\n\n469\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.727\nSo, we're going back to my screen here,\nreal quick, we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n470\n00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:51.876\nwhat we'll do is I'll open up\nthe Bluetooth preferences on the Mac.\n\n471\n00:23:51.876 --> 00:23:56.773\nAll right, I don't have any devices yet\nto find, I gotta turn Bluetooth on, right?\n\n472\n00:23:56.773 --> 00:23:58.547\nNow, just because I turned Bluetooth on,\n\n473\n00:23:58.547 --> 00:24:00.588\nI don't have the devices\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n474\n00:24:00.588 --> 00:24:01.880\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n475\n00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.382\nlet me see if I can get this out of\nthe way so you guys can see that there.\n\n476\n00:24:05.382 --> 00:24:09.819\nI'm gonna turn on the Bluetooth\nhere on the iPad.\n\n477\n00:24:09.819 --> 00:24:14.670\nNow what I should see after a bit here is,\nI should see, well, there's the MacBook.\n\n478\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.300\nNotice the MacBook shows up and\nI have an iPad here as well.\n\n479\n00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.526\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead on the iPad and\nI'm gonna click Wes' Macbook Pro, and\n\n480\n00:24:22.526 --> 00:24:27.160\nnotice it's going to ask me, pair with the\ndevice to complete the pairing process.\n\n481\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.000\nWe're gonna ahead and we're gonna say yes,\nand now the iPad is connected, right?\n\n482\n00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.886\nAnother way too that you can do this, so\none of the things that I have right here,\n\n483\n00:24:36.886 --> 00:24:39.157\nI got in my hand this little magic pad,\nright?\n\n484\n00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:43.083\nSo you can see, I told you that\nyou test the functionality, right?\n\n485\n00:24:43.083 --> 00:24:46.440\nWell, let me show you how real quick how\nyou can test the functionality, all right?\n\n486\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.960\nIf I turn this on,\nthis is gonna give me the same thing.\n\n487\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.010\nAnd I'll go ahead disable the iPad\nhere cuz we don't need that right now.\n\n488\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.150\nBut I do wanna show you,\n\n489\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.760\nnotice that same process here, got\nWes' Trackpad there and it says Pair up.\n\n490\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.250\nAll right, and\nit should tell me that I'm connected.\n\n491\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.250\nWell, how do I know that I'm connected,\nright?\n\n492\n00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.110\nLook mum, no hands, right?\n\n493\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.660\nWell, now all I gotta do is move\nmy hand across the magic pad and\n\n494\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.240\nyou can see that it is working, right?\n\n495\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.137\nSo that's one of the ways that you can\ntest the connectivity if it is some\n\n496\n00:25:16.137 --> 00:25:17.295\nkind of tracking device, or\n\n497\n00:25:17.295 --> 00:25:19.973\na point device, right,\nthat you're gonna control the cursor.\n\n498\n00:25:19.973 --> 00:25:21.743\nIf it happens to be some\nkind of audio device,\n\n499\n00:25:21.743 --> 00:25:23.572\nmake sure there's music coming out, right?\n\n500\n00:25:23.572 --> 00:25:26.370\nAnd that's one of the easiest ways,\ncan you hear something coming out of it.\n\n501\n00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:29.550\nThis is one of the easiest ways that when\nit comes to testing the connectivity of\n\n502\n00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.090\nany Bluetooth connection,\nyou can ensure that it is properly paired.\n\n503\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, really great stuff,\ngood information for\n\n504\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.610\nus to know, not just for\nour exam but in practical life.\n\n505\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.904\nBecause a lot of times this can be\na confusing process for a lot of people,\n\n506\n00:25:41.904 --> 00:25:44.748\nespecially if it's your first\ntime entering the thing.\n\n507\n00:25:44.748 --> 00:25:47.160\nMan, what's all these numbers and pairing?\n\n508\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.390\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n509\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.240\nIt's not that bad,\n\n510\n00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.660\nyou just need to have it broken down like\nour good man Wes here has done for us.\n\n511\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.260\nWe do appreciate that Wesley.\n\n512\n00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.550\nBut we do have more information to go,\nso we're gonna need to go to a part two,\n\n513\n00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.120\nbecause that clock is\nshowing well out of time.\n\n514\n00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.757\nWe do thank you good folks for\nwatching, so signing off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n515\n00:26:03.757 --> 00:26:04.842\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n516\n00:26:04.842 --> 00:26:05.714\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n517\n00:26:05.714 --> 00:26:08.227\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n518\n00:26:08.227 -->

another\nexciting episode of ITPro.tv.\n\n9\n00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.305\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:23.097\nwell prepare yourselves because we're\nback with more in A+, that's right.\n\n11\n00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:26.845\nAnd actually taking a further look\ninto mobile network connectivity.\n\n12\n00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:27.865\nVery cool stuff in there.\n\n13\n00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:30.615\nWes is joining us today.\n\n14\n00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.195\nOur good man Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:32.975\nWelcome to the show sir.\n\n16\n00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.505\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great man.\n\n17\n00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:35.215\nGreat to be here.\n\n18\n00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:38.500\nThat's right, we are moving on in,\nwell like Dan said,\n\n19\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.010\nconnectivity, email, and\nthings like synchronization.\n\n20\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.230\nAnd you know what's interesting is, well,\nwe haven't gotten to the email part or\n\n21\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.210\nthe synchronization.\n\n22\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.230\nWe took care of the network.\n\n23\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.886\n&gt;&gt; We'll get to that.\n\n24\n00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:48.430\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n25\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.930\nWe took care of the connections,\nright, in the first one.\n\n26\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.610\nConnectivity we talked about some of\nthe different types of connections.\n\n27\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.340\nSo if you're not aware of that go back and\nwatch it as you might be supporting these\n\n28\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.960\nat home right now or maybe even\nin your own business environment.\n\n29\n00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.860\nAnd definitely, like Dan mentioned,\nstudying for that 220-902 exam.\n\n30\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.760\nNow we're gonna move into the email,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.800\nWe're gonna talk about, well, one of the\nmost important things inside of mobility\n\n32\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.350\nand mobile devices is, well,\nhow we send and receive our email and\n\n33\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.200\nthe applications that we use and\nsome of the configurations.\n\n34\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.458\nSo that if they do give you any kind\nof scenario that you'll know how to do,\n\n35\n00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:27.865\neven some basic installation and\nconfiguration of those communications.\n\n36\n00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:31.121\nNow when it comes to corporate email, and\n\n37\n00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:37.272\nISP email configuration this is really\ngonna depend on what the settings are.\n\n38\n00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:41.070\nLike for instance, your Internet service\nprovider might require you to use\n\n39\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.822\nthings like POP3,\npost office protocol version 3.\n\n40\n00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:47.404\nRemember that when you do get that\nconfigured, especially for the exam,\n\n41\n00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:50.082\nremember that is going to\nbe over port 110, right?\n\n42\n00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.769\nIf my ISP says here is our POP3 server and\n\n43\n00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:57.843\nthese are the settings understand\nthat configure the ports to port 110.\n\n44\n00:01:57.843 --> 00:02:02.245\nIf it's IMAP, which is another common one,\nremember the Internet message or\n\n45\n00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:03.590\nmail access protocol.\n\n46\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.386\nRemember that is going\nto be your port 143,\n\n47\n00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:10.960\nas far as the communication types and\nwhen you go to configure it.\n\n48\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.920\nHowever, you might be configuring\nthings like commercial providers.\n\n49\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.550\nIt could be something like Exchange,\nit could be something like Outlook.com.\n\n50\n00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.610\nAnd I have to tell you, in today's day and\n\n51\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.520\nage, you might have\nan on-premise Exchange server.\n\n52\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.270\nBut even more so, you might have\nOutlook.com, which is in the cloud.\n\n53\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.870\nSo you really have to pay attention\nto that, cuz we talk about data\n\n54\n00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.190\nsynchronization, we talk about the local\ndesktop versus the cloud providers.\n\n55\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.180\nKeep in mind that if you're\nusing a cloud provider,\n\n56\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.840\nthat means you're using\nsoftware as a service.\n\n57\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840\nYou're probably using\nsomething like Outlook.com,\n\n58\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.460\nyou're using something like Google,\nif you will, to do your email.\n\n59\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.730\nHowever, if you're using Exchange\nthat means you could be using\n\n60\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.970\nthings like POP three where you're gonna\npull that information down at the desktop.\n\n61\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.790\nYou're gonna erase that\ncopy off the server.\n\n62\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.685\nSo, keep in mind it really depends on\nwhat are you talking about, right?\n\n63\n00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.700\nAre you talking about the corporate\nenterprise environment?\n\n64\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.100\nIs it gonna be a cloud interface?\n\n65\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.400\nIs it gonna be a local desktop interface?\n\n66\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.121\nOr is it gonna be an ISP configuration?\n\n67\n00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.323\n&gt;&gt; Interesting thing about this West is\nthat this is probably the most wanted\n\n68\n00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:20.592\nfeature in mobile devices, also it can\nbe the most frustrating feature for\n\n69\n00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:23.000\nadministrators and mobile devices.\n\n70\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.390\nI can't tell you how many devices you\nclick yes I want an Exchange account,\n\n71\n00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.633\nthere you go, there's all the settings,\nwhy aren't you working.\n\n72\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.919\nIt's not working, you have to go\nthrough it a million times and\n\n73\n00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.833\nfinally it starts to work.\n\n74\n00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:37.740\nPlus there's a little bit,\nI've noticed at least there was.\n\n75\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.220\nIt might be a little bit better now.\n\n76\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.990\nWhere there's a bit of\na synchronization issue,\n\n77\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.990\nwhere it can take a little time before\nthings actually start working really well.\n\n78\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.100\nSo you've just gotta be prepared for that.\n\n79\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.100\nAnd that's real life thing kinda stuff,\nnot necessarily for\n\n80\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.650\nthe exam, but my experience with it.\n\n81\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the most unknowing things\nsometimes in computing is drivers,\n\n82\n00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.990\nprinters, and then of course, last but\nnot least, I guess in no specific order,\n\n83\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.220\nthere is email as well.\n\n84\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.470\nSo it can definitely be problematic.\n\n85\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.060\nI do want to mention the other thing too\nwith business email is that port settings,\n\n86\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.160\nSSL settings, you might have to set things\nlike Secure Socket Layer as well as SMIME,\n\n87\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.830\nthe Secure Multimedia\nInternet Mail Extensions.\n\n88\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.170\nA fancy acronym for\nessentially securing your emails.\n\n89\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.790\nUses a combination of\npublic key cryptology and\n\n90\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.970\nencryption essentially to scramble your\nemail so that if you send it to an email\n\n91\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.430\nto somebody that only the owner of\nthat email, the person that you're.\n\n92\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.650\nBasically keeping it encrypted so\n\n93\n00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.700\nthat only the authorized person\ncan be able to view that.\n\n94\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.610\nNow other things that you might have to\nlook at too are integrated commercial\n\n95\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.810\nproviders and do email configuration and\nthings like data synchronization.\n\n96\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.503\nLet me go ahead and\nwe'll quit talking so much here.\n\n97\n00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:55.660\nWe'll actually dive into\nmore some of the settings.\n\n98\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.728\nSo here in my desktop I've got again\nour iPad on one side running IOS.\n\n99\n00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:04.637\nWe've got our Android on the right hand\nside there and it is running, well,\n\n100\n00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.760\nthe Android operating system.\n\n101\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.940\nI do want to kinda mention\nthe settings here.\n\n102\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.642\nIf we go to Settings.\n\n103\n00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:14.240\nAll right, and\nyou can see right here we have Mail.\n\n104\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.300\nAnd I'll tell you what, let me see if\nI can make that a little bit bigger.\n\n105\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.690\nIt looks like that's\na little hard to see here.\n\n106\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.610\nSee if we can increase\nthe resolution size there.\n\n107\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.960\nThere we go, and\nwe can see right here if I select Mail,\n\n108\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.430\nthis is gonna give us our mail settings,\nright?\n\n109\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.840\nAnd we can see just some general settings,\nright, about signature, if you will.\n\n110\n00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.710\nBut what I'm really worried about more\nthan anything is I want to see this\n\n111\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.400\nAdd Account.\n\n112\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.030\nNotice the Add Account here?\n\n113\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.280\nNow this is where they talk about your\nintegrated commercial provider email.\n\n114\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.920\nAnd I can choose Add Account, and look,\n\n115\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.060\nwe've got some different\nthings that we can do, right?\n\n116\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.060\nWe can do iCloud.\n\n117\n00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.720\niCloud's great for\ndata synchronization as well.\n\n118\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.330\nComes to data synchronization iCloud can\ndo things like your contacts, programs,\n\n119\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.730\nthink of iTunes, right?\n\n120\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.500\nDownloading your email, pictures, music,\nyour video, calendars and bookmarks.\n\n121\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.530\nIt's a great thing to have for iCloud.\n\n122\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.630\nWe can do Exchange here as well.\n\n123\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.211\nYou know,\n\n124\n00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.420\nif we ended up using exchange we could\ndo whatever your corporate account is.\n\n125\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.880\nYou would login to that.\n\n126\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.920\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one to set up.\n\n127\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n128\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.370\nAnd then it shows you what\nthe device ID is to for\n\n129\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.840\njust authenticating the device, right?.\n\n130\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.520\nGoogle, let me cancel that out here.\n\n131\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.850\nI tell you what we'll go ahead and\nwe use Outlook 365 here at ITPro.tv,\n\n132\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.460\nso I'll see if I can't set up real quick\n\n133\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.670\nmy own email.\n\n134\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.409\nSo we'll do wes@itpro.tv and\n\n135\n00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.571\nwe'll choose next.\n\n136\n00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:49.210\nAnd you know what,\nit's not going to let me.\n\n137\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.290\nIt says it doesn't exist.\n\n138\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.230\nOkay, so it's not going to let me do that\nwith a commercial, that might actually,\n\n139\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.610\nyou know what's interesting is that might\nactually be the Exchange, let's see here.\n\n140\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.540\nLet's go ahead and do,\nlike I said it gets a little tricky cuz\n\n141\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.768\nMicrosoft likes to change\nnames of their product there.\n\n142\n00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:14.115\nSo ITPro.tv and I might just call that,\nwe'll just call it exchange.\n\n143\n00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:16.420\nWe'll see if it verifies it, right?\n\n144\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.490\nAll right now, if we can just\ntake away from the camera here,\n\n145\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.740\nI'm gonna type in a password.\n\n146\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.310\nI certainly don't want people\nout there seeing my password.\n\n147\n00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.720\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n148\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.235\nI'll type in my password and\nwe'll see if it is going to connect.\n\n149\n00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:31.310\n&gt;&gt; Password1 is your password?\n\n150\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't let them know that\n123456 is the name of my password here.\n\n151\n00:07:36.545 --> 00:07:40.891\nAnd here's where, and\nwe can go ahead and see this.\n\n152\n00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:42.250\nYou can take a look at this.\n\n153\n00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.880\nThis is some of the additional information\nthat you might have to end up putting in.\n\n154\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.740\nThe server name, right, username and\npassword and a description.\n\n155\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.739\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll just cancel out of that.\n\n156\n00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:53.282\nAnd I'm gonna show you also\nhow to log into Google,\n\n157\n00:07:53.282 --> 00:07:55.719\nbut those are some of\nthe basic configurations.\n\n158\n00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:57.100\nAgain, you could see Yahoo here.\n\n159\n00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.408\nYou could see Google,\nExchange, and iCloud.\n\n160\n00:07:59.408 --> 00:08:04.323\nNow, we can also do this commercial\nproviders as well like for instance,\n\n161\n00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:06.240\nthe Google with your inbox.\n\n162\n00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.470\nAnd let me go ahead,\nI'll show you the Google one as well.\n\n163\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.755\nSo if I go back down to my Android device.\n\n164\n00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:17.055\nWe'll end up seeing\nhere that I have Gmail.\n\n165\n00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:19.005\nNow Gmail, you have to do the same thing.\n\n166\n00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:21.635\nYou have to log in and\nyou could see Welcome to Gmail and\n\n167\n00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:26.618\nI could go through the process lets you\nget and there's their social emails.\n\n168\n00:08:26.618 --> 00:08:29.320\nYou can do also things\nlike social media as well.\n\n169\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.660\nSocial media data can be\nsynchronized likewise.\n\n170\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.550\nIt's one of the great things about\na lot of these integrated providers.\n\n171\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.200\nThey do a lot of things at one time.\n\n172\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.650\nWe'll go ahead and choose Done here,\nand we'll add an email address.\n\n173\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.020\nAnd here, it's kind of interesting.\n\n174\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.440\nYou see a lot of the same things.\n\n175\n00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.290\n&gt;&gt; Very similar.\n\n176\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.193\n&gt;&gt; That we see here, too.\n\n177\n00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:52.090\nSo there's the Office 365 and\nyou can see that's what we use here.\n\n178\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.970\nAnd that's why I said it gets confusing.\n\n179\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.560\nNotice we have Exchange and we've got\nOutlook, but here it says Exchange and\n\n180\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.390\nOffice 365, and that's actually\nwhat we use here at ITProTV.\n\n181\n00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.190\n&gt;&gt; And you know what else can get\nconfusing is a lot of these companies\n\n182\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.650\nGoogle, Yahoo,\nthey have their own mail apps.\n\n183\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.660\nYou don't have to use the mail app\nthat comes with the mobile device.\n\n184\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.724\nAnd a lot of them,\nthey want you to use their apps, so\n\n185\n00:09:14.724 --> 00:09:17.865\nit's like now I have got\nsix different mail apps.\n\n186\n00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:19.560\nBecause I have my personal account,\n\n187\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.520\nI have my business account,\nI've got my sign up for stuff account.\n\n188\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.460\nThat kind of thing.\n\n189\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.650\nSo, it can get a little\nunruly after a while,\n\n190\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.640\nbut it's just rolling with the punches\nit comes to mobile devices.\n\n191\n00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n192\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.370\nAnd, I will go ahead.\n\n193\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.457\nLet's try to shine in a couple\ncuz I really kinda wanna show you\n\n194\n00:09:36.457 --> 00:09:41.344\nthe Office 365 as well again cuz they\ndo call out Exchange and Outlook.\n\n195\n00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:42.974\nSo let me go ahead and show you that one.\n\n196\n00:09:42.974 --> 00:09:44.413\nWe'll also show you Gmail too.\n\n197\n00:09:44.413 --> 00:09:49.542\nLike I said, when we get to the password\npart there I'll probably say,\n\n198\n00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:53.700\nhey, can we basically get\naway from the password there.\n\n199\n00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.010\nLet me back up here and\nmake sure I pushed the right one.\n\n200\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.867\nThere we go.\nExchange, so\n\n201\n00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:02.711\nmy email address is wes@itpro.tv.\n\n202\n00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:08.060\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe will enter that, itpro.tv.\n\n203\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.550\nAnd we'll choose next.\n\n204\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.710\nNow here's where it gets tricky.\n\n205\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.110\nThis is gonna be the password.\n\n206\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.310\nSo if we can just for a second here,\nI just wanna kind of go away\n\n207\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.860\nfrom the password again cuz I\ndon't anyone knowing my password.\n\n208\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.050\nAnd I don't want to have to change\nit right after this episode and\n\n209\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.610\nthen constantly every day after this.\n\n210\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.005\n&gt;&gt; Paranoia pays in this business.\n\n211\n00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:30.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes it does, yes it does.\n\n212\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.360\nLet's see if it'll retrieve\nmy account information.\n\n213\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.270\nWe can go ahead and show that.\n\n214\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.710\nIt says, to configure your account,\n\n215\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.110\nGmail is asking to send an, so\nyou're gonna basically be redirected here.\n\n216\n00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.880\nAnd it's a redirection request here.\n\n217\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.950\nNow, remember we said ports.\n\n218\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.310\nWe talked a little bit about ports,\nand you can see that right here.\n\n219\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.540\nNotice that it's saying, hey, TLS,\nTransport Layer Security, as well as SSL.\n\n220\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.530\nAnd again port numbers are important but\nfor\n\n221\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.850\nPOP3, remember if it asks you that,\nPOP3 would be port 110.\n\n222\n00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.820\nIf it happen to be iMap,\nit will be port 443.\n\n223\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.560\nAnd will go ahead and\nchoose no certificates here and\n\n224\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.539\nwill choose and\nvalidate the server settings here.\n\n225\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.650\nAll right, and it'll go ahead and\nnow what it's doing is it's actually\n\n226\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.310\nlogging me over to,\nlaunching me over here to Gmail.\n\n227\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.890\nLet's go ahead and activate that.\n\n228\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.960\nYour account is set up and\nthe email is on the way.\n\n229\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.530\nSo there's one account that we have.\n\n230\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.490\nLet's go ahead and let's get in here and\nlet's add a Gmail account.\n\n231\n00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.050\nLet's see if it'll actually\nlog me into my Gmail account.\n\n232\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.680\nLet's go ahead and we'll do a new one.\n\n233\n00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:48.170\nI do wanna do an existing one here.\n\n234\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.690\nLet's do an existing one.\n\n235\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:55.900\nSo this one here is going to be,\nif I remember right, it's 220902,\n\n236\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.250\nand this is A+.\n\n237\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.975\nYou can't see what I created\nthis account for, right?\n\n238\n00:12:03.975 --> 00:12:05.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Aplus.\n\n239\n00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.500\n&gt;&gt; 22902, aplus, thank you.\n\n240\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.700\nThank you, right there, aaplus.\n\n241\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.415\nI'm glad I got Dan here with\nme to help my spellchecker.\n\n242\n00:12:13.415 --> 00:12:17.730\n[LAUGH] All right and we got at gmail.com.\n\n243\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.980\nThis is why Wes should\nnever type on camera.\n\n244\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.530\nAnd here's another password here, guys.\n\n245\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.832\nSo if we could just steer away\nfrom that one just for a second.\n\n246\n00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:27.539\n&gt;&gt; Pay no attention to\nthe man typing his password.\n\n247\n00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.604\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, nothing to see here,\n\n248\n00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:30.337\nthat's for sure.\n\n249\n00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:31.672\n&gt;&gt; Move along, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n250\n00:12:31.672 --> 00:12:35.770\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so as I type this,\nI know it's a little monotonous here.\n\n251\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.089\nBut we do wanna kinda show\nyou how to set these up.\n\n252\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.560\nAnd hopefully we'll go ahead and\nwe'll chose Done.\n\n253\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.590\nAnd now we can go ahead, and\nwe can show the EULA on this.\n\n254\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.720\nIt's telling me we're gonna\nagree on the Terms of Service.\n\n255\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.450\nHopefully I've entered\nthat password right.\n\n256\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.530\nIf not,\nwe're gonna find out here in a second.\n\n257\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't sign in.\n\n258\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:55.980\n&gt;&gt; It couldn't sign in.\n\n259\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.229\nSo let's go ahead, and\nlet's try that again here.\n\n260\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.640\nAnd again, this is back to\nthe whole password thing here.\n\n261\n00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.160\nSo if you'll just bear with me here,\nwe're gonna not show that password.\n\n262\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.090\nI'm gonna try one more time here.\n\n263\n00:13:10.653 --> 00:13:12.894\nI can try one more time here.\n\n264\n00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:21.450\nAnd gotta love typing in passwords.\n\n265\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.930\nIsn't this fun, which is done.\n\n266\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.990\nWe'll try that one more time and\nhopefully, there we go.\n\n267\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.710\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go ahead and\n\n268\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.900\nlook at this two, because this also\nbrings us into data synchronization.\n\n269\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.010\nRemember, I kind of mentioned some of\nthe data synchronization that you can do.\n\n270\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.430\nWe can do things like backups and\nrestores.\n\n271\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.180\nWe can back up our programs\nto things like Google.\n\n272\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.320\nGoogle Play remembers the fact\nthat you purchased an application.\n\n273\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:53.260\nThe App Store, iTunes, they remember\nthe fact that you have your programs done.\n\n274\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.070\nCalendars, bookmarks, music,\nif you're talking about iTunes, it's so\n\n275\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.920\ngood to have this.\n\n276\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.340\nAnd this isn't something\nthat just happens,\n\n277\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.560\nin Google it isn't something that\njust happens with your IOS as well.\n\n278\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.950\nIt also happens in Windows.\n\n279\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.390\nYou can use your Microsoft account.\n\n280\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.350\nYour Windows used to be\ncalled the Windows Live ID.\n\n281\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.480\nAnd that's great.\n\n282\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.050\nThat's where your single Sign On is.\n\n283\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.060\nThey call it mutual authentication for\nmultiple services.\n\n284\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.000\nIn this case, Gmail, Google docs or\n\n285\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.590\nif you're talking about iTunes,\niCloud, my iPad, the AppStore.\n\n286\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.970\nBeing able to synchronize all of this\ninformation across multiple services and\n\n287\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.790\nover here for instance we have iBooks.\n\n288\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:40.580\nOnce I log in to, if you will, once I\nlog in to things like for instance my\n\n289\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:46.000\niCloud I can now synchronize things\nlike ebook, my PDFs if you will too.\n\n290\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.060\nSo a lot of good fun things\nthat we can do here.\n\n291\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.432\nNow I'll go ahead and\nmy head's kind of covering it up here,\n\n292\n00:14:53.432 --> 00:14:57.207\nbut now we have essentially\ntwo different service or\n\n293\n00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:01.700\ntwo different accounts that\nare now connected via our email.\n\n294\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.497\nAnd at the same time we can do things\nnow like data synchronization and\n\n295\n00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:09.240\nthat is a great thing to have,\nit's good to be able to synchronize.\n\n296\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.270\nYahoo, I've kind of barely mentioned Yahoo\nbut Yahoo also allows you to log in,\n\n297\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:20.640\nit's called Ymail,\nagain Yahoo also has their own likewise.\n\n298\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.250\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we have to keep in mind.\n\n299\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:30.180\nOther things too, keep in mind other data\nsynchronization types that you can do for\n\n300\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.380\ninstance, location data.\n\n301\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.310\nKeep in mind location data.\n\n302\n00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.630\nThat might be a security concern for you.\n\n303\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.570\nI'm not really sure if you're\nin a corporate environment.\n\n304\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.420\nThat might be a security concern for you.\n\n305\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.830\nOne of the things that it might not\nbe a security concern or it could be,\n\n306\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.900\nlet me tell you what I mean.\n\n307\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.393\nSo security concern in the fact that\nthese third parties are tracking your\n\n308\n00:15:49.393 --> 00:15:51.660\ninformation and\nthey're scraping your data.\n\n309\n00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.701\nAnd that might be a security concern for\nyour corporation.\n\n310\n00:15:53.701 --> 00:15:56.399\nThe other thing is, there might be\na security implementation cuz they\n\n311\n00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:57.826\ncan do what's known as geo fencing.\n\n312\n00:15:57.826 --> 00:16:02.082\nGeofencing means that I can give you\naccess to certain resources when you're in\n\n313\n00:16:02.082 --> 00:16:03.810\nwithin a certain location too.\n\n314\n00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.560\nWhat else do we have there to, Dan?\n\n315\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.180\nAll right, so they also talk about\nthings like updates as well and\n\n316\n00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.900\nwe have to get into that likewise.\n\n317\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.570\nYeah Dan,\nwhen we're talking about updates,\n\n318\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.130\nthey mention some terms in here\nthat a lot of times we don't see.\n\n319\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:23.770\nAnd they're really updated with\njust any normal software update.\n\n320\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.260\nAnd that is the PRI updates,\nPRL updates, baseman updates,\n\n321\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.760\nthat's your preferred roaming list.\n\n322\n00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.100\nSo, it's a little text database.\n\n323\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.950\nAnd if I get here into for\ninstance, the settings and\n\n324\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.140\nI guess I got the settings up here.\n\n325\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.270\nI can just go right here to settings,\nright?\n\n326\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.960\nYour software updates that happen in\nthings like your Android devices,\n\n327\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.670\nyou can actually do this by going\nto More and then About the device.\n\n328\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.764\nAnd there's the software update option,\nright.\n\n329\n00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:55.980\nHere on your iPad, you just go to Settings\nand I'm kind of in there already.\n\n330\n00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.040\nYou might be in a different location.\n\n331\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.830\nJust look at General, right,\nand you can go About.\n\n332\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:06.320\nYou can see, for instance, what is\nthe current version of your iOS and\n\n333\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.840\nthen if you need to do software updates,\nwell, you just click Software updates.\n\n334\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.120\nIt's letting me know, hey we're up to\ndate, I don't need to do anything.\n\n335\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.110\nBut those again, again,\nthe PRL prefer roaming lists,\n\n336\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.850\na lot of times we don't do\nany configurations to that.\n\n337\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.790\nThat just means that when I connect\nmy phone to a CDMA network and\n\n338\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.845\nI go into roam,\nwhich providers is it gonna use.\n\n339\n00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:27.475\nAgain, that's what they\ncalled the preferred roaming.\n\n340\n00:17:27.475 --> 00:17:29.985\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, when it comes to\nupdates in our mobile devices,\n\n341\n00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:32.255\na lot of times that's kind of handled for\nus.\n\n342\n00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:34.235\nThey're automatically doing these things.\n\n343\n00:17:34.235 --> 00:17:38.220\nNot that we wouldn't from time to time\nmake sure that we have the latest updates\n\n344\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.330\nfor troubleshooting purposes, but\ntypically it's just happening.\n\n345\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.180\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthey're doing radio firmware as well.\n\n346\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.470\nAnd you might hear the term, to kind of\nadd to what Dan, that train of thought,\n\n347\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.280\nthey're called OTA updates over the air.\n\n348\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.320\nRight, cuz all I do is I push software\nupdate and it does everything over.\n\n349\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.420\nWe think of firmware updates,\nI don't know about you, Dan.\n\n350\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.089\nBut when I think of firmware updates,\nI think of hands-on.\n\n351\n00:18:00.089 --> 00:18:02.754\nWhen I update the firmware to\na BIOS on a workstation or server,\n\n352\n00:18:02.754 --> 00:18:04.690\nI'm physically touching the server.\n\n353\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.370\nWith the exception of some remote\ntechnologies, but for the most part,\n\n354\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.089\nyou're hands-on.\n\n355\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.100\nOTA just means over the air and\nthat's how all of these things work.\n\n356\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.800\nAre pretty much gonna be updated\ninside your mobile operating systems.\n\n357\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.358\nAgain, remember the PRI updates,\nPRL updates, base span and\n\n358\n00:18:21.358 --> 00:18:25.970\nyou're radio firmware, just like Dan said,\nit's bundled into everything.\n\n359\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.790\nBasically, they're gonna\ntake care of that.\n\n360\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.963\nNow there are a couple last little\nterms that I kind of do wanna mention.\n\n361\n00:18:32.963 --> 00:18:39.940\nAnd they mention an EMEI [LAUGH] or\nexcuse me, I'm sorry, an IMEI.\n\n362\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.688\nGotta love these acronyms,\nand then an IMSI.\n\n363\n00:18:43.688 --> 00:18:46.748\nLet me help you out with those,\nsince I need some help pronouncing them or\n\n364\n00:18:46.748 --> 00:18:48.020\nsaying the acronym right.\n\n365\n00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.720\nThe first one, IMEI, what is that?\n\n366\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.860\nThat is the International\nMobile Equipment Identity.\n\n367\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.460\nA lot of times I like to say identifier,\nbut it's identity, right?\n\n368\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.740\nAnd essentially what this is is this is a\nnumber inside of your device that lets you\n\n369\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.390\nknow who the manufacturer\nof the device is.\n\n370\n00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.410\nThink about our MAC addresses,\nwhat does that do?\n\n371\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.064\nRight, that lets me know\nof the network adapter,\n\n372\n00:19:10.064 --> 00:19:13.160\nthe ethernet adapter lets me\nknow of the hardware vendor,\n\n373\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.930\nas well as the uniqueness of\nthat adapter within the device.\n\n374\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.800\nWell, this identifies\nthe manufacture of the phone,\n\n375\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.400\nas well as uniquely identifying\nthe phone within that manufacturer.\n\n376\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.430\nNow the other one is the IMSI,\n\n377\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.590\nthat is the International\nMobile Subscriber identity.\n\n378\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.020\nThis is how on things like LTN network,\nCDMA, GSM networks,\n\n379\n00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.000\nhow the subscriber recognizes you when\n\n380\n00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.670\nyou connect to their networks and the\ndifferent local locations that you have.\n\n381\n00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.934\nNow, I will tell you that the IMEI-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:19:54.934 --> 00:19:56.840\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna be careful on that one is\n\n383\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.360\nalso the way they block devices,\nall right?\n\n384\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.950\nHave you ever had to do a warranty\ncall cuz maybe somebody's device or\n\n385\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.480\nyou got insurance and\nsomebody stole you're device?\n\n386\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.410\nWell guess what, that device,\nonce it's stolen, and\n\n387\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.800\nit's reported to the manufacturer,\nthey use that IMEI.\n\n388\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.130\nTo just basically block it\noff of their network and\n\n389\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.990\nthat helps things like fraud, right?\n\n390\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.362\n&gt;&gt; Wes, is that that number printed on the\nlittle sticker on the inside of my battery\n\n391\n00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:24.084\nor whatever on a lot of times\nyou see that [CROSSTALK]\n\n392\n00:20:24.084 --> 00:20:24.870\n&gt;&gt; You can find it there.\n\n393\n00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.110\nIn fact, that's a great question.\n\n394\n00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.740\nLet me show you exactly\nwhere you can find that.\n\n395\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.820\nSo going back into our device, right?\n\n396\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.450\nWe're in the About Devices\nhere on our Android, right?\n\n397\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.890\nI can go in here and\nI can look at the status, and\n\n398\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.210\nI believe you will find it right there,\nright?\n\n399\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.443\nYou can see it's just a little,\nI think it's 64 bit, right?\n\n400\n00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; 15 characters.\n\n401\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.400\nSo I've also seen, the earliest\nstandards were 15 characters, but\n\n402\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.340\nnow that you'll see that there are some\nthat are 15 and there's 16 and 17, right?\n\n403\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.194\nThis one essentially is\na 17 character number.\n\n404\n00:20:58.194 --> 00:20:58.774\nNow I say that,\n\n405\n00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:00.637\nyou're gonna count these and whoever-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:01.154\n&gt;&gt; Follows us right now,\n\n407\n00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:03.367\nthey're gonna count and they're gonna say-\n&gt;&gt; There's only 12.\n\n408\n00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:04.670\n&gt;&gt; No, they're gonna say it's 15.\n\n409\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, what do you mean there's 17?\n\n410\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.340\nWell, they added on an extension, and\n\n411\n00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.670\nsometimes you'll see that\ninside of the phone as well.\n\n412\n00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.279\nIn fact, I think I can show you here.\n\n413\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.560\nHere's another little service code and\nI don't know if I can remember it.\n\n414\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.149\n&gt;&gt; Might wanna zoom out there, Wes here.\n\n415\n00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:22.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know if I can-\n&gt;&gt; On your Mac.\n\n416\n00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.260\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n&gt;&gt; You're like totally-\n\n417\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.270\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n418\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.931\nLet's try that again,\nso you guys can see it,\n\n419\n00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:30.259\nI don't know if I can remember the code.\n\n420\n00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:34.430\nYep, there we go, and no, that's not it,\nthat's a different signal altogether.\n\n421\n00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.880\nBut Dan, it's essentially where\nyou can find that number and\n\n422\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.710\nwhen you do bring that number up.\n\n423\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.160\nKeep in mind that again, like I've said,\nif they ask you about it,\n\n424\n00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.350\nthat number uniquely\nidentifies the device itself.\n\n425\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.800\nA portion of it identifies\nthe manufacturer and\n\n426\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:57.190\nthen this one is relative\nlater in that IMEI standard.\n\n427\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.340\nThat SV stands for software version.\n\n428\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.690\n&gt;&gt; That's why originally,\nit would just be the 15 character number.\n\n429\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.040\nAnd then they started out\nin a 16th character and\n\n430\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.090\nthe 16th character would be a checksum,\njust verifying the whole entire number.\n\n431\n00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.410\nAnd then eventually they\nadded even more to that,\n\n432\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.070\nto where they could kind of tell\nwhat software version you had too.\n\n433\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:21.190\nSo not only could a carrier say okay,\nI know who manufactured your device.\n\n434\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.040\nI know the unique ID of the device but\n\n435\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.570\nI also know the software version\nthat you're running as well.\n\n436\n00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.960\nSo just a way to essentially\nidentify the device likewise too.\n\n437\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.270\nAnd again, the international\nmobile subscriber identifier or\n\n438\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:39.240\nidentity is the way that the provider\nwill identify you as you move\n\n439\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.460\nthrough different locations within the\nvarious cell towers within their networks.\n\n440\n00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, very cool stuff.\n\n441\n00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.380\nWe've definitely gone\nthrough a lot of different\n\n442\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.580\naspects to our mobile devices\nwhen it comes to connectivity,\n\n443\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.060\nsynchronization, working with data,\na lot of good information there.\n\n444\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.120\nAgain, the A+ exam is\na very comprehensive exam.\n\n445\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.830\nAnd they try to focus in on things\nthat you're actually going to work\n\n446\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.470\nwith in real life.\n\n447\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:07.290\nSo, even if you've never taken the exam or\nnever take the exam, this information will\n\n448\n00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.510\nserve you well as a technician if\nthat's the field you get in to.\n\n449\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.650\nWes, I think you did a great job of\nshowing us all the mobile aspects that we\n\n450\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.190\nneed to know for that exam.\n\n451\n00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.360\nBut we are out of time for this episode,\nthank you for dropping by.\n\n452\n00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.010\nWe thank you for\n\n453\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.690\nwatching, signing off for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n454\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:22.317\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n455\n00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:24.675\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n456\n00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:30.659\n[MUSIC]\n\n457\n00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.869\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO TV.\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n9\n00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:20.147\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we are moving on,\n\n10\n00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:22.426\ncontinuing forward with\nmore in our A+ series.\n\n11\n00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:25.829\nAnd we're glad that you have\njoined us today and when I say us,\n\n12\n00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.600\nI mean my good friend and\nmyself, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.150\nWes?\n\n14\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.850\nWelcome back sir and\nhow are we doing today?\n\n15\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.476\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing okay.\n\n16\n00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:33.355\nGreat to be here today, and\n\n17\n00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:37.379\nwe are gonna be diving into\na tin foil hat episode for sure.\n\n18\n00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.649\nWe're gonna be talking about threats and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n19\n00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.297\nAnd when it comes to security,\nyou have to know a little bit about\n\n20\n00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:45.800\nsome of these different threats and\nvulnerabilities that we have out there.\n\n21\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.370\nLet's go ahead and let's define\nwhat a vulnerability Is, all right?\n\n22\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.150\nA vulnerability is any weakness or\n\n23\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.050\nflaw within a system that\nleaves us open to attack.\n\n24\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.610\nA threat is any kind of event\n\n25\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.040\nthat actually seeks to\nexploit that vulnerability.\n\n26\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.060\nAnd we have to know about some of these.\n\n27\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.430\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.000\nOne of the very first things that they\ncall out is something known as malware.\n\n29\n00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.600\nNow when we talk about malware, what\nwe're talking about is really any kind of\n\n30\n00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.740\nmalicious piece of software or code,\nif you will, that runs on your machine.\n\n31\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.480\nThat causes some kind of unauthorized,\nundesired effect.\n\n32\n00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.910\nNow when it comes to malware, there are\nall different kinds of malware out there.\n\n33\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.070\nIn fact, one of the very first ones that\nthey've talked about is something known as\n\n34\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.080\nSpyware.\n\n35\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.930\nNow when we talk about spyware,\nunderstand that Spyware,\n\n36\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.610\nin fact I got a little\nbit of a diagram here.\n\n37\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.180\nSpyware is one that gets on your computer,\nand\n\n38\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.510\nwhat it really does is it\nmonitors your browsing habits.\n\n39\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.610\nIt monitors things like your\nlocal data store if you will,\n\n40\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.260\nmonitor things like your, again,\nweb browsing, email clients, and.\n\n41\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.830\nMore importantly, when we talk about\nSpyware is that it actually can collect\n\n42\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.820\nthat information and it can send it out.\n\n43\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.030\nAnd when it sends it out,\n\n44\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.110\nit can send it out to a collection\nlocation where they can turn around.\n\n45\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.420\nAnd they can resell this information if\nthey want to things like corporations for\n\n46\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.190\nthe purposes of well, giving you\nadvertisements and stuff if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.500\nBut it also can happen\nto be identity thieves.\n\n48\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.430\nSo Spyware again,\n\n49\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.280\nis one that just basically monitors your\nhabits, your browsing habits if you will.\n\n50\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.270\nNow one that's not on the list,\nthat's close to this is called Adware.\n\n51\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.920\nAnd Adware is one that gets on\nyour machine, and when it does,\n\n52\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.661\nit tries to put these pop-ups.\n\n53\n00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:30.490\nPop-ups are a really telltale\nsign that you've got some kind of\n\n54\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.460\nAdware on your machine, and\nit basically presents these advertisements\n\n55\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.850\nalong your browsing path as you're\nout there across the internet.\n\n56\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.560\nNow we do have other types of malware as\nwell, we have what are known as viruses.\n\n57\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.710\nNow when a Virus is\nessentially a component or\n\n58\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.420\na piece of software that needs some\nkind of host, it needs to be able to\n\n59\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.760\npiggy back like a file attachment if you\nwill or a file transfer, file download.\n\n60\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.540\nIf you end up visiting for\ninstance maybe a malicious website.\n\n61\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.650\nKeep in mind, we talked about\nHTTP in the prior episodes.\n\n62\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.040\nYou're actually asking,\n\n63\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.040\nthe web browsers asking the webpage of\nthe web server hey, I need this resource.\n\n64\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.175\nWell there isn't really any guarantee\nout there that the resource that's\n\n65\n00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:19.610\ngonna be turned back to the web browser,\nthen rendered locally on the client.\n\n66\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.630\nIs gonna be non malicious.\n\n67\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.430\nSo you can get Viruses that way.\n\n68\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.910\nThey can be USB-based, Email-Based or\ncould be other infected systems too.\n\n69\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.480\nKeep in mind, one of the big things about\nthe piece of malware known as a virus,\n\n70\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.650\nis that it does need a host to\nmake it's way on to your computer.\n\n71\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.270\nAnd the reason I kinda stress that\nis because this next component,\n\n72\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.700\nit doesn't need a host.\n\n73\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.470\nAnd that's something known as a Worm.\n\n74\n00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.090\nAnd Worms are very nasty\npieces of malware,\n\n75\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.200\nvery nasty piece of code because\nit's actually a self sufficient.\n\n76\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.100\nReplicating piece of code, and\nit really doesn't need a host.\n\n77\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.250\nYou can actually stand on the outside\nof your router out there on the,\n\n78\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.836\noutside of your access point in between\nyour network and your ISP's network,\n\n79\n00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:02.377\njust waiting for a port of entry.\n\n80\n00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:05.630\nAnd again, these can also be.\n\n81\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.700\nThey can be internet based,\nthey can consume things like USB, again,\n\n82\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.390\nmail, email systems.\n\n83\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.740\nOther infected systems too and\nwhat they kind of do,\n\n84\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.120\nwhat they really seek to do is\nconsume all your resources.\n\n85\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.080\nFor instance your disk IO, you might start\nto ramp up and if you open task manager\n\n86\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.250\ninside a Windows you'll notice you've\ngot 99%, 100% disk utilization.\n\n87\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.890\nConsuming your memory, network resources.\n\n88\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.290\nIn fact, we have to worry about Worms\nbecause of the fact that they are self\n\n89\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.760\nsufficient, and\n\n90\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.090\nthe fact that they can just maintain\ntheir own lifecycle if you will.\n\n91\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.440\nBut then they're also replicating.\n\n92\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.160\nThey can replicate themselves,\nhence the term Worm.\n\n93\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.950\nYou cut one Worm in half,\nyou end up having two Worms, and\n\n94\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.290\nagain each one of those worms is\nnow their own independent entity.\n\n95\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.620\nWell, Worms work the same\nway in computing.\n\n96\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.990\nEach one of those replicas becomes now\nits own self-sufficient piece of code\n\n97\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.770\nthat can now, again regenerate itself.\n\n98\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.190\nSo definitely have to worry about Worms.\n\n99\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.230\nNow the other type of malware that\nyou have that we need to be aware of,\n\n100\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.280\nare what are known as Trojans.\n\n101\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.890\nAnd a Trojan is one that may not seem\nlike it's really malicious in any way,\n\n102\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.960\nbecause what it does is it usually in and\nof itself, it's not an attack.\n\n103\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.940\nBut it paves the way for\nadditional attacks.\n\n104\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.590\nAnd again, these can make their way\nonto your system through things like\n\n105\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.690\nweb browsing.\n\n106\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.210\nThat's why we always say, go to known,\n\n107\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.560\ntrusted sites,\ndon't go to non-trusted sites.\n\n108\n00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.120\nFile transfers can happen.\n\n109\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.210\nIf you do a file transfer you can\nalso get Trojan Horses as well.\n\n110\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.010\nEmails, it's one of the reasons we tell\npeople don't open ann unsolicited email.\n\n111\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.560\nIf you don't know where that\nemail came from don't open it,\n\n112\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.980\nlet alone if it has an attachment.\n\n113\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.090\nDon't open the attachment.\n\n114\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.570\nThe other one too, are things like macros.\n\n115\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.040\nMacros are these little pieces of code\nthat actually run within an application,\n\n116\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.600\nlittle execution instructions.\n\n117\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.732\nWell, guess what.\n\n118\n00:06:01.732 --> 00:06:02.788\nYou can get Viruses.\n\n119\n00:06:02.788 --> 00:06:03.844\nYou can get Worms.\n\n120\n00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:08.943\nAgain, you can get Trojans too,\nby executing macros within documents.\n\n121\n00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:12.034\n&gt;&gt; Well that should be surprised at\nhow difficult it is to keep a user\n\n122\n00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:15.780\nfrom opening emails and\nattachments from people they don't know.\n\n123\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.940\nI've dealt with this all the time.\n\n124\n00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.090\nWe actually had a virus propagate\nthroughout the company I worked for.\n\n125\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.690\nWe called the accounting office\nthat was causing the issue.\n\n126\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.050\nWe told them do not open your email,\nyou have a virus, we need to clean it off,\n\n127\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.970\nwe need to get it off the rest of\nthe systems you've already infected, and\n\n128\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.910\nthen we'll be good to go.\n\n129\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.960\nAnd they kept reopening it.\n\n130\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.970\nThey kept reopening it.\n\n131\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.370\nAnd we told them you have this article.\n\n132\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.520\nI have to look at my email.\n\n133\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.710\nNot right now you don't.\n\n134\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.190\nIt is insane, so user awareness can\ngo a long way in helping stop that.\n\n135\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.120\n&gt;&gt; That is probably one of the best\npieces of advice you guys have out there.\n\n136\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.370\nWhen we talk about security,\nwhen we talk about information security.\n\n137\n00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.120\nWe've also mentioned\nthis in other episodes.\n\n138\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.250\nA lot of times what we've done is we've\nadopted, like the military best practices.\n\n139\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.090\nWe talk about a defense,\na layer defense system.\n\n140\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.960\nIt's called Defense In-Depth.\n\n141\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.590\nAnd if you look at it, the first line\nof defense are policies, procedures and\n\n142\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.230\nawareness.\n\n143\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.084\nUser awareness why don't you do this?\n\n144\n00:07:12.084 --> 00:07:16.872\nWell, people sometimes don't well do\nit anyways because they're not aware of\n\n145\n00:07:16.872 --> 00:07:20.515\nwhy they should not, but\nas you start to educate your users,\n\n146\n00:07:20.515 --> 00:07:24.529\nyou make them aware it can help to\nstop these things in their track.\n\n147\n00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.354\nSo again keep in mind, that when it\ncomes to things like user awareness,\n\n148\n00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:30.380\nit's constant communication.\n\n149\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.930\nAs the IT staff, as the helpdesk, you\nshould educate the users as why and you\n\n150\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.815\ncan keep that communication open because\nagain, it really is a cyclic process.\n\n151\n00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:44.265\nNow, with the Trojan Horse here,\nit usually paves for the way for\n\n152\n00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:46.315\nadditional attacks too.\n\n153\n00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:50.575\nAgain, it could be some kind of virus, for\ninstance, I've got some examples here.\n\n154\n00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:55.252\nCould be again things like Spyware, that\nit could be downloading to your computer,\n\n155\n00:07:55.252 --> 00:07:57.702\ncould be something like a logic bomb.\n\n156\n00:07:57.702 --> 00:07:58.662\nNow, what's a logic bomb?\n\n157\n00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:02.795\nLogic bombs aren't called out on threats\nand vulnerability here in this exam, but\n\n158\n00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:05.286\nI wanna go ahead and\nmention it cuz you never know.\n\n159\n00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:07.351\nIf it might show up on the exam or\nnot, right?\n\n160\n00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:11.707\nA logic bomb is typically a piece\nof malware that waits for\n\n161\n00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:13.720\na trigger event, right?\n\n162\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.550\nIt has some kind of trigger that activates\nit, but it doesn't activate right away.\n\n163\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.098\nWhat it tries to do is propagate\nitself to more and more devices and\n\n164\n00:08:22.098 --> 00:08:23.590\nthen it triggers, right?\n\n165\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.913\nAnd a logic bomb, all three of these that\nI'm gonna talk about are really closely\n\n166\n00:08:27.913 --> 00:08:32.060\nintertwined when it comes to their\nsuccess on getting on multiple machines.\n\n167\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.750\nSo for instance you download a Trojan.\n\n168\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.280\nIt has a logic bomb inside it and that\nlogic bomb waits for this trigger event.\n\n169\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.270\nWhat's the trigger event, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.940\nAnd we talked about propagating\nitself to other computers, right?\n\n171\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.360\nAs many as possible.\n\n172\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.047\nWell, what it's doing is it could\nbe creating what's known as,\n\n173\n00:08:50.047 --> 00:08:52.337\nthey call it zombie computers, right?\n\n174\n00:08:52.337 --> 00:08:54.607\nMore commonly called botnet, all right?\n\n175\n00:08:54.607 --> 00:08:59.333\nAnd what you have is essentially you\nhave this drone software if you will\n\n176\n00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:03.925\nthat is propagated through Trojans,\nthrough multiple computers.\n\n177\n00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:07.056\nThey wait for a trigger event just like\na logic bomb and then what they do,\n\n178\n00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:11.684\nis they simultaneously\nattack a single target.\n\n179\n00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:15.825\nYou'll go on to learn in additional\nsecurity technologies and\n\n180\n00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:20.747\nwhen it comes to additional threats,\nyou'll learn about what are known as\n\n181\n00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:24.045\ndistributed denial or\nservice attacks, right?\n\n182\n00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:27.773\nWhere if we attack a single\ntarget we can bring it offline.\n\n183\n00:09:27.773 --> 00:09:31.017\nIf the target is big enough,\na single attack won't do it, so\n\n184\n00:09:31.017 --> 00:09:34.459\nwe need to basically aggregate\nmultiple computers together and\n\n185\n00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:37.650\nall simultaneously attack\nthat single target.\n\n186\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.170\nThat's essentially what a botnet is.\n\n187\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.270\nYou might here it called a zombie based\nnetworks and that's because again it's got\n\n188\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:48.130\nthis drawn software that what the attacker\ndoes, is the attacker essentially\n\n189\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.270\nissues that command, that the logic\nbomb software is waiting on.\n\n190\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.058\nAnd when that command comes out, it says\nhere, I want you to attack this endpoint.\n\n191\n00:09:57.058 --> 00:09:58.019\nAll right, so\n\n192\n00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:03.080\nthat's a little bit about some of the\nother ones that we need to be aware of.\n\n193\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.940\nThe other thing too,\nare what are known as rootkits.\n\n194\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.970\nWhen we talk about a root kit,\nwell, what is a root kit?\n\n195\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.224\nAll right well, we have to kinda\ntake a trip back in time and\n\n196\n00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:13.110\nunderstand where it\noriginally got it's name.\n\n197\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:18.570\nBecause, even though its name\nmeant one thing in the olden days,\n\n198\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.720\nit doesn't really mean\nthat today,all right?\n\n199\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.760\nAnd when we talk about rootkits,\nwhat we're talking about,\n\n200\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.070\nI want you to go think about Unix\nbased operating systems, right?\n\n201\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.625\nThe highest privileged account, the most\nprivileged account on those earlier Unix\n\n202\n00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:37.261\noperating, even today and Linux operating\nsystems is what is known as the root user.\n\n203\n00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.485\nSee, the root user has,\nkind of in a Windows environment,\n\n204\n00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:43.074\nwe call it the Windows administrator,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:43.074 --> 00:10:47.985\nIt has privileged access to the system,\nutilities if you will, configurations,\n\n206\n00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:49.261\nsecurity settings.\n\n207\n00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.760\nWell, what the original rootkits would do,\nis they would try to install themselves\n\n208\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.040\nand when they install themselves,\nthey try to get that root user access so\n\n209\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.359\nthat they can take\ncontrol over the system.\n\n210\n00:10:58.782 --> 00:11:05.070\nNow, rootkits today aren't necessarily,\nWindows you don't have a root user, right?\n\n211\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.260\nYou have an administrative user.\n\n212\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.080\nSo the concept is still the same, and\n\n213\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.230\nthe fact that they're trying to gain\nprivileged access to the machine.\n\n214\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.800\nBut just don't think it is as\nexploiting the root account, right?\n\n215\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.187\nAnd when we say privileged access,\nit could be so much so,\n\n216\n00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:24.129\nthat they sit down in the level of\nthe kernel in between the drivers,\n\n217\n00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:27.935\nin between things like your\noperating system and your hardware,\n\n218\n00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:32.710\nto where when you run things like your\nantivirus software or antimalware software\n\n219\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.934\nas it's collectively called today, cuz we\ndon't just have viruses, we have malware.\n\n220\n00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:42.878\nAnd it hides itself, it hides itself\nfrom that anti-malware software and\n\n221\n00:11:42.878 --> 00:11:47.744\nwhat it sees is, it sees that this piece\nof software is trying to find it and\n\n222\n00:11:47.744 --> 00:11:52.452\ninstead of it just finding it,\nit tells that piece of software, yeah,\n\n223\n00:11:52.452 --> 00:11:55.260\nhere's what I want you to see.\n\n224\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.750\nSo it hides itself, right?\n\n225\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.110\nThe other thing too is that it can get so\n\n226\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.570\nlow down into the operating system and\nthe abstract architecture, if you will.\n\n227\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.587\nRemember we have the user, we have\nthe graphical user interface, right,\n\n228\n00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:11.590\nwhere the user interacts.\n\n229\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.050\nAnd then from there we have the kernel,\n\n230\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.030\nwhich is the lower portions of\nthe operating system with the drivers and\n\n231\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.800\nall the executive services,\nwe have firmware and then hardware.\n\n232\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.600\nWell imagine a rootkit being\nable to hide itself so\n\n233\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.860\nwell that even the CPU doesn't\neven know that it's there.\n\n234\n00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.880\nSo these can be very,\nvery nasty pieces of software.\n\n235\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.120\nAnd in fact,\nthey can be very difficult to identify and\n\n236\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.620\nget off of these machines, right?\n\n237\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right,\nbecause you never know when you actually\n\n238\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.890\nacquired said thing,\nand what happens then?\n\n239\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.870\nWell, I'll go to a backup, I'll be fine.\n\n240\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.990\nWell, do you know if that backup\nis got the infection in it or not?\n\n241\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.220\nCuz I sure don't.\n\n242\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.206\nAnd a lot of times when it comes down to\nthat, well, what are you gonna have to do?\n\n243\n00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:56.894\nWe're talking about smoking a computer,\nreinstalling, and\n\n244\n00:12:56.894 --> 00:12:59.820\nthen hopefully, I mean you're done.\n\n245\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.390\nIt's a worst case scenario to\nbe honest with you because you\n\n246\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.390\ndon't know what file might be infected.\n\n247\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\n\n248\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.650\ninside of Windows environment they have\nwhat's called ELAM drivers, right?\n\n249\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.762\nWhat's an ELAM driver?\n\n250\n00:13:10.762 --> 00:13:13.420\nELAM is just another acronym\nthat I'm throwing at you guys.\n\n251\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.510\nThat means early launch\nanti malware driver.\n\n252\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.230\nAnd this is interesting because when\nyour operating system goes to boot,\n\n253\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.819\na lot of times you don't have protection,\nright?\n\n254\n00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:25.900\nYour anti malware software\nhasn't even initiated.\n\n255\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.835\nAnd rootkits like to start well before\nthe operating system even gets started.\n\n256\n00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:35.227\nSo what Windows has built into it,\nright, is down there in the boot files,\n\n257\n00:13:35.227 --> 00:13:40.043\nbefore we even launch system drivers,\nthat's why it's called early launch anti\n\n258\n00:13:40.043 --> 00:13:43.321\nmalware driver,\nis that is actually loads and it says,\n\n259\n00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:48.250\nlet me check the boot configuration, let\nme check the system drivers, all right?\n\n260\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.970\nAnd let me check the operating system and\n\n261\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.829\nthe kernel and find out if they've\nmaintained their integrity.\n\n262\n00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.530\nAnd if they have,\nI'll let the boot loader go ahead and\n\n263\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.020\nboot strap the operating system.\n\n264\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.127\nBut if I see any sort of\ncompromise on there, guess what?\n\n265\n00:14:01.127 --> 00:14:04.333\nI'm gonna shut the machine down, right?\n\n266\n00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:08.121\nThat's one of the benefits of having\nsomething like that because of\n\n267\n00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:11.830\nthe rootkits being so\ndifficult to get off of your machines.\n\n268\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.587\nA lot of times what you have\nto do is an offline clean or\n\n269\n00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.605\neven more offline like says.\n\n270\n00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Completely reinstall the operating\n\n271\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.190\nsystem, cuz they can be\nnightmares to take care of.\n\n272\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.210\nNow the other one we have out there.\n\n273\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.140\nAnd I'm gonna actually couple\ntwo of these together,\n\n274\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.840\nbecause one of them isn't\ntalked about the other one is.\n\n275\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.716\nThe first one that is talked\nabout is called ransomware.\n\n276\n00:14:33.716 --> 00:14:38.827\nAnd there have been a bunch of\nransomware scares as of July 2017.\n\n277\n00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:40.893\nHere you probably heard of\nsome of them in the news,\n\n278\n00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:44.430\nif not just do a Google search for\nransomware and you're gonna find them.\n\n279\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.810\nOne of the most common ones is\nwhat's known as the FBI warning.\n\n280\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.980\nThis is the one where it\nlocks down all of your\n\n281\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.730\nfunctionality within your operating system\nand it puts an FBI warning up there.\n\n282\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.305\nAnd basically the only thing you're\nallowed to do, at best, the only thing\n\n283\n00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:03.953\nthat you're allowed to do is communicate\noutbound to some kind of third party\n\n284\n00:15:03.953 --> 00:15:08.833\nserver where you can pay them a fee to\nessentially unlock your computer, right?\n\n285\n00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:13.240\nOther forms of malware, or\nransomware if you will, what they'll do.\n\n286\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.910\nAnd Ben, let me show you.\n\n287\n00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.320\nThey'll actually encrypt your information\nso much so, that when they encrypt your\n\n288\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.260\ninformation, you end up having to connect\nto some kind of third-party website and\n\n289\n00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:31.560\npay them to unencrypt your software or\nyour hard drive if you will.\n\n290\n00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.262\nNow, the other thing to keep in mind and\n\n291\n00:15:33.262 --> 00:15:36.523\nthis is the other one I like to throw\nin there too is called rogue antivirus.\n\n292\n00:15:36.523 --> 00:15:40.471\nCuz rogue antivirus is another one\nthat can lock out your computer,\n\n293\n00:15:40.471 --> 00:15:44.072\nmuch the same way ransonware does,\nin the fact that it runs and\n\n294\n00:15:44.072 --> 00:15:46.996\nit makes you think that\nyou got all these viruses.\n\n295\n00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:50.210\nBut the only way you're actually gonna\nbe able to use your computer now is if\n\n296\n00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.140\nyou, again,\n\n297\n00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.750\nconnect outbound to that third-party\nwebsite kinda convenient, right?\n\n298\n00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.530\nThe only thing you can do is\ncommunicate with Internet Explorer-\n\n299\n00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.713\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like the planned\n\n300\n00:15:58.713 --> 00:15:59.474\nit that way [LAUGH].\n\n301\n00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:00.950\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly.\n\n302\n00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.705\nAnd you pay them money to\nunlock your computer, right?\n\n303\n00:16:03.705 --> 00:16:05.722\n&gt;&gt; It's a pay for service, right?\n\n304\n00:16:05.722 --> 00:16:07.123\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very good,\n\n305\n00:16:07.123 --> 00:16:12.062\nThat's why you want to have things\nlike task manager available to you or\n\n306\n00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:17.002\nprocess kill from assist internals\nbecause when they a lot of times what\n\n307\n00:16:17.002 --> 00:16:21.695\nransomware does is it locks down\nall legitimate exe applications,\n\n308\n00:16:21.695 --> 00:16:26.030\nexecutable applications,\nthings like task manager.\n\n309\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.490\nMight even be locked out, right?\n\n310\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:33.600\nIt's gonna give you just enough\nfunctionality to either contact a website,\n\n311\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.970\nor it might even lock that down and\nit gives you a phone number and\n\n312\n00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.160\nthey tell you you gotta call,\nmake some kinda digital transfer, right?\n\n313\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.930\n&gt;&gt; Even if they didn't, I mean,\nthese are encrypted files.\n\n314\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.440\nYou need that key to\nunencrypt those files,\n\n315\n00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.890\nso even if they were kind\nenough to not totally hose you,\n\n316\n00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.760\nyou're still not getting at your\ndata without that encryption key.\n\n317\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.330\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, so\nbe very careful with ransomware.\n\n318\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.340\nIt is one of those things that we're\nseeing a lot more of it today,\n\n319\n00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.460\nit is very prevalent.\n\n320\n00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.970\nThat's why it is always good,\nwhen talking about malware,\n\n321\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.610\nis to ensure you have some\nkind of anti-malware software.\n\n322\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.680\nRunning on your machine from the get-go,\nright?\n\n323\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.730\nYou just, you have to have it,\nalso keep your definitions up to date.\n\n324\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.766\nKeep in mind the way we define new pieces\nof malware that could potentially get\n\n325\n00:17:18.766 --> 00:17:21.389\non your machine,\nis through definitions right?\n\n326\n00:17:21.389 --> 00:17:24.027\nThat's why they call them definitions and\n\n327\n00:17:24.027 --> 00:17:28.424\nif you don't have the current definitions\nyou can run into problems and\n\n328\n00:17:28.424 --> 00:17:33.038\nagain your software while good to have\nmight not be accurately identifying\n\n329\n00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:37.453\nthings that are currently threats\nthat are currently on your machine.\n\n330\n00:17:37.453 --> 00:17:41.175\nNow speaking of additional\nthreats that we have.\n\n331\n00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:44.745\nWe also have some different\nsocial engineering\n\n332\n00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:46.245\nthings that we have to worry about, too.\n\n333\n00:17:46.245 --> 00:17:49.715\nSo let's go ahead, I've got an example\nof some on the screen here.\n\n334\n00:17:49.715 --> 00:17:51.545\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's just talk about, well,\n\n335\n00:17:51.545 --> 00:17:53.635\nwhat is social engineering in general?\n\n336\n00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:56.235\nWell, social engineering is\nwhere you try to get some\n\n337\n00:17:56.235 --> 00:17:59.225\nkind of authoritative information, right?\n\n338\n00:17:59.225 --> 00:18:04.330\nYou try to get some information that gains\nyou access whether it be to an account.\n\n339\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.820\nWhether it be to a system.\n\n340\n00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.140\nWhether it be to the data\nthat's on that system.\n\n341\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:15.190\nAnd, it really tries to exploit\nthings like your human vulnerability.\n\n342\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.605\nThere are different types of social\nengineering that you have to be aware of.\n\n343\n00:18:18.605 --> 00:18:20.690\nThere's what's know as phishing.\n\n344\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.710\nPhishing is an interesting scam and\nyou've probably seen this before.\n\n345\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.160\nThis is where you get an email and\n\n346\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.940\nit's somebody telling you you've just won\na gazillion dollars and they'd love to\n\n347\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.470\ngive you the first gazillion dollars if\nyou would give them your bank information,\n\n348\n00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.260\na bank statement and\nthey'll transfer the money over to you.\n\n349\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.150\nNow, there's also different\nforms of phishing,\n\n350\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.390\nlike one of the ones they call out is\nwhat's known as Spear Phishing and\n\n351\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.090\nwith Spear Phishing this\nis in a targeted attack.\n\n352\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.080\nAnd this is where you get instead of\njust getting a generic email that tries\n\n353\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.200\nto just that they just send out to\neverybody in the world hoping that just\n\n354\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.510\na handful of people might\nrespond back to it and\n\n355\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.080\nthey can make some money,\nthis is where I say, you know what?\n\n356\n00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.440\nI'm gonna send email to Dan, and\nit's gonna say, well you know what?\n\n357\n00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.420\nIt's gonna come from maybe\nsomebody Dan knows, right?\n\n358\n00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.290\n&gt;&gt; Just targeting me specifically.\n\n359\n00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.130\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthey've done their research, right?\n\n360\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:12.020\nThey've done their research and they said,\nokay, well, we see these 10, 15, 20,\n\n361\n00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.800\n100 employees.\n\n362\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.330\nWe know that they use this company.\n\n363\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.960\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna send\nthem an email that looks like it's coming\n\n364\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.200\nfrom that company so\nthey'll say, yeah, yeah.\n\n365\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.610\nI recognize that person so\nthat's gotta be a legitimate email,\n\n366\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.070\nwith hoping that they get some\nkinda success out of the deal.\n\n367\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.514\nNow, other kinds of social engineering\nthat we have to worry about is Tailgating,\n\n368\n00:19:33.514 --> 00:19:34.146\nall right?\n\n369\n00:19:34.146 --> 00:19:36.040\nTailgating is one that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n370\n00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.170\nYou might also hear things\nlike piggyback attacks.\n\n371\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.600\nTailgating is where, again, another one\nthat kind of preys on human vulnerability.\n\n372\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.530\nThe fact that we like to help people,\nyou could say a piggyback attack,\n\n373\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.890\nyou could say tailgating.\n\n374\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:54.600\nImagine an issue where somebody's\ncoming up to the door and they're\n\n375\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.640\ndressed in some kind of outfit that looks\nlike they're trying to deliver something.\n\n376\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.230\nYou have a secure door there and somebody\njust leaves the door open for you,\n\n377\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.050\nright, and you allow them in.\n\n378\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.920\nWell, that's impersonation, right?\n\n379\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.240\nImpersonation is the fact that they're\nimpersonating the fact that they should be\n\n380\n00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.320\nthere or\nthat they're delivering something.\n\n381\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.200\nWhen really they're just the attacker.\n\n382\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.600\nTailgating goes a little bit farther and\nmore malicious.\n\n383\n00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.390\nBecause what that says is, you know what?\n\n384\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.930\nAs that door is closing, the one person\nthat was authorized to go through that\n\n385\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.950\ndoor, it didn't close it fast enough.\n\n386\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.650\nSo what ends up happening is somebody\nends up following behind them.\n\n387\n00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.120\nAgain, that's the tailgating attack.\n\n388\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.700\nI have to worry about this in\nthe apartment complex that I have.\n\n389\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.070\nBecause I go up to that\nauthenticated door.\n\n390\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.770\nI open the door.\n\n391\n00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.200\nDoor takes forever to close.\n\n392\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.910\nBut I'm not gonna sit there and wait for\n\n393\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.990\nit to close on my car as\nI'm going through it.\n\n394\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.010\nSo as I pull through that gate,\nwell guess what.\n\n395\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.770\nSomebody else follows in through.\n\n396\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.900\nSo that's why we have things\nlike man traps, if you will.\n\n397\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.400\nMan trap is a form, and we'll talk\nabout physical security coming up, but\n\n398\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.850\nthis is where you go into\na public entrance, a public door.\n\n399\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.250\nThat public door closes and then you\nwalk to the end of the hallway and\n\n400\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.640\nyou authenticate on the other,\nto the secure area.\n\n401\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.240\nThe secure area door opens up, you go\nthrough the secure area door, it closes,\n\n402\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.260\nand then allows public access for the next\nperson going into the man-trap, right,\n\n403\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.880\nyou can think of things like barricades.\n\n404\n00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.830\nDumpster Diving.\n\n405\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.350\nDumpster Diving is another one that\nwe also have to worry about, right,\n\n406\n00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.870\nwhen it comes to social engineering.\n\n407\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.890\nA lot of times people put a lot of\ninformation, writing information down.\n\n408\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:32.035\nIf you can think about it, one of the\nlocations that really is very convenient\n\n409\n00:21:32.035 --> 00:21:35.845\nfor attackers that are in social\nengineering, are those yearly calendars.\n\n410\n00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:39.955\nA lot of people like to scribble all kinds\nof important information and little dates,\n\n411\n00:21:39.955 --> 00:21:44.350\nnumbers if you will,\nmaybe account passwords, well guess what?\n\n412\n00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.780\nThey end up in the dumpster and\n\n413\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.450\nif people are doing dumpster diving they\ncan collect personal information that can\n\n414\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.230\nbe used to mount or gain unauthorized\nattacks of different accounts.\n\n415\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.790\nThen we have one of the most basic ones,\nright?\n\n416\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.300\nThat's called Shoulder Surfing.\n\n417\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.180\nShoulder Surfing is exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n418\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.982\nThat's where you're looking\nover somebody's shoulder and\n\n419\n00:22:01.982 --> 00:22:03.131\nyou're trying to glean information.\n\n420\n00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:07.620\nThat's one of the reasons we talk\nabout things like privacy filters.\n\n421\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.050\nPrivacy filters are important, right?\n\n422\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.940\nBecause what it does,\nis it means if somebody isn't\n\n423\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.250\nright in front of the monitor they\nreally can't see what's going on, right?\n\n424\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.825\nSo we have to worry\nabout shoulder surfing,\n\n425\n00:22:17.825 --> 00:22:20.479\nyou have to worry about that at ATMs,\nright?\n\n426\n00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:24.999\nPeople like to look over your shoulder see\nif they could guess whatever your pin is,\n\n427\n00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:29.518\nthat you're typing in as you're using your\nATM card or your debit card if you will,\n\n428\n00:22:29.518 --> 00:22:30.180\nat the ATM.\n\n429\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.570\nSo you also have to worry about\nthings like shoulder surfing.\n\n430\n00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.750\nAll right, so what are some of\nthe other ones that we have,\n\n431\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.790\nthat we have worry about?\n\n432\n00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.805\nWell one of the other ones we have\nto worry about is what is known as\n\n433\n00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:41.675\na man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n434\n00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:45.145\nAll right, now a man-in-the-middle attack\ncould be on your local network, right?\n\n435\n00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:48.235\nIf it's on your local network\na lot of times it's done for\n\n436\n00:22:48.235 --> 00:22:52.345\nthe purposes of eavesdropping to find out\nwhat information is going between you,\n\n437\n00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:53.965\na source, and a destination.\n\n438\n00:22:53.965 --> 00:22:56.135\nBut keep in mind this could be\nout there on the Internet too and\n\n439\n00:22:56.135 --> 00:22:57.560\na lot of times it is.\n\n440\n00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.140\nIn the fact that a man in the middle\nattack is when the attacker actually sits\n\n441\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.130\nbetween source and\ndestination of a communication.\n\n442\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.920\nAnd again, best case scenario all\nthey're doing is eavesdropping.\n\n443\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.640\nWorst case scenario is they do\na session hijacking attack or\n\n444\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.430\nsomething like that where they\nactually redirect information.\n\n445\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.731\nSo coming from this client\ngoing up maybe to the server,\n\n446\n00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:23.000\nthis hacker that's in between, or attacker\nthat's in between gathers information and\n\n447\n00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.981\nthen passes it off to the server.\n\n448\n00:23:24.981 --> 00:23:29.601\nAnd eventually what can happen is if it's\nin a session hijacking attack is that\n\n449\n00:23:29.601 --> 00:23:34.501\nthis attacker can gain enough information\nfrom the source of the communication and\n\n450\n00:23:34.501 --> 00:23:37.581\nthings like session cookies\nwhere it can really just\n\n451\n00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:40.319\ntake that computer\ncompletely out of the mix.\n\n452\n00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:43.506\nNow there's no way for\nthe server in this case to know that hey,\n\n453\n00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:47.842\nthat's actually not the legitimate person\nin this conversation, that's actually\n\n454\n00:23:47.842 --> 00:23:51.960\nthe attacker, so we have to worry about\nthing like man in the middle attacks too.\n\n455\n00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're very fun to do by\nthe way, if you've never done one,\n\n456\n00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.430\nit's not too difficult, especially\nif you're on a wireless network,\n\n457\n00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.800\nYou can kinda play around with that.\n\n458\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.601\nOnly on networks that you have authorized\naccess to do so on though, right?\n\n459\n00:24:01.601 --> 00:24:02.412\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n460\n00:24:02.412 --> 00:24:03.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One of the other attacks\n\n461\n00:24:03.898 --> 00:24:06.430\nwe have to worry about is what's\nknown as a spoofing attack.\n\n462\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.491\nNow, a spoofing attack is a little bit\ndifferent than an impersonation attack.\n\n463\n00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:12.754\nSee, an impersonation attack is where\nyou're pretending to be somebody\n\n464\n00:24:12.754 --> 00:24:17.229\nyou're not, but the party that's involved,\nthe victim, knows that you're there.\n\n465\n00:24:17.229 --> 00:24:19.038\nRight?\nIf I impersonate like I'm a UPS\n\n466\n00:24:19.038 --> 00:24:22.440\ntruck driver, if you will,\nright, they know that I'm there.\n\n467\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.629\nThey can see me in the outfit.\n\n468\n00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.533\nIf I call up and I say,\nhey, this is the help desk.\n\n469\n00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:31.473\nWe're gonna need your password because\nat 5 o'clock we're doing some kind of,\n\n470\n00:24:31.473 --> 00:24:33.830\nI don't know maintenance,\non your PC, right?\n\n471\n00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.820\nThey can hear me,\nthey know that I'm there, but\n\n472\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.900\nI'm pretending to be somebody I'm not.\n\n473\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.300\nSpoofing, on the other hand, you're\npretending to be somebody you're not.\n\n474\n00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.722\nBut the purpose is to conceal the fact\nthat you're even there, right?\n\n475\n00:24:44.722 --> 00:24:48.329\nFor instance, maybe you can\nget crafty with this, in fact,\n\n476\n00:24:48.329 --> 00:24:52.602\nthat you can make it look like you're\nthe source of the communication.\n\n477\n00:24:52.602 --> 00:24:55.951\nOr you can make somebody believe\nthat you're the destination of\n\n478\n00:24:55.951 --> 00:24:58.441\nthe communication,\nlike a server if you will.\n\n479\n00:24:58.441 --> 00:25:01.930\nAnd all you've done is you manipulated\nthe IP address of a network pack.\n\n480\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.700\nAnd now, again, that's not really\ntypically easy, but it can be done.\n\n481\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.020\nSo spoofing is kinda like impersonation.\n\n482\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.820\nBut the difference is you're\npretending to be somebody you're not.\n\n483\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.350\nBut you're trying to conceal the fact\nthat you're even there to begin with.\n\n484\n00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.610\nAll right, so one of the other\nthings that I wanna talk about, too,\n\n485\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.270\nis something known as a zero-day.\n\n486\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.880\nA zero-day exploit.\n\n487\n00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.240\nYou might hear it called\na zero-day attack, all right?\n\n488\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.960\nLet's go ahead and talk about a zero-day.\n\n489\n00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.570\nNow, I've got a little diagram here and\nwe'll kinda go through it,\n\n490\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.383\ncuz we really gotta kinda zoom in.\n\n491\n00:25:32.383 --> 00:25:35.643\nThere's a lot that goes into zero-day,\nall right?\n\n492\n00:25:35.643 --> 00:25:37.971\nZero-day, we're talking about\nvulnerabilities, right?\n\n493\n00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.837\nAnd vulnerabilities happen\nall over the place, right?\n\n494\n00:25:40.837 --> 00:25:43.489\nCould be software,\ncould be a vulnerability,\n\n495\n00:25:43.489 --> 00:25:46.900\na weakness that you're not even aware of,\nright?\n\n496\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.470\nWell, the vulnerability can be introduced,\nright, before it's ever discovered.\n\n497\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.490\nA vulnerability that isn't discovered,\nwe're not really worried about.\n\n498\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.030\nBut then the vulnerability\nbecomes discovered, all right?\n\n499\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.780\nAnd that's where the problem comes in.\n\n500\n00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.290\nBecause then,\n\n501\n00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:06.550\nthings like attackers can learn that\nthe vulnerability can be exploited.\n\n502\n00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.271\nAnd that's when we got a problem, right?\n\n503\n00:26:08.271 --> 00:26:14.377\nZero-day just means this period of time\nwhen a vulnerability can be exploited and\n\n504\n00:26:14.377 --> 00:26:17.481\nthe vendor remains unaware, all right?\n\n505\n00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:22.235\nSo we have this period of time where\nthe hacker or attacker says, hey,\n\n506\n00:26:22.235 --> 00:26:27.350\nnot only did I find this vulnerability,\nI found a way to exploit it.\n\n507\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.910\nSee, because a discovered vulnerability\ndoesn't necessarily mean that it's\n\n508\n00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.123\nreally a problem, right?\n\n509\n00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:34.831\nBecause we could say that,\nyeah, theoretically,\n\n510\n00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:36.621\nyou could crack this encryption.\n\n511\n00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:39.130\nBut it'd take you\na gazillion years to do it.\n\n512\n00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.370\nWell, that could be,\ntheoretically, a vulnerability,\n\n513\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.830\nbut it's not really one I\nworry about patching up.\n\n514\n00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.350\nNow you also have to keep in mind\nthat what happens too in the zero-day\n\n515\n00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.090\nis that the vulnerability\nexploit is then implemented.\n\n516\n00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:57.060\nAnd the problem is the vendor isn't\naware that it even exists, and\n\n517\n00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.840\nthat's when security is\nat its lowest point.\n\n518\n00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.820\nBut then you have some people that say,\nwell,\n\n519\n00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.710\nthen you go through vendor awareness,\nvendor becomes aware.\n\n520\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.018\nAnd you're still vulnerable, right?\n\n521\n00:27:07.018 --> 00:27:10.232\nCuz then the vendor has to go through\na patch deployment or development,\n\n522\n00:27:10.232 --> 00:27:11.320\nif you will.\n\n523\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.220\nAnd then they have to go through\na patch release and that takes time.\n\n524\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:20.050\nAnd it's only until the patch is released\nthat you start to get user awareness.\n\n525\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.538\nAnd the problem is just because you have,\nwell, users that are aware,\n\n526\n00:27:23.538 --> 00:27:26.400\ndoesn't mean they've actually\npatched their systems.\n\n527\n00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.218\nRemember that the vulnerability doesn't\nstop until the system is actually patched.\n\n528\n00:27:30.218 --> 00:27:36.030\nIn fact, Dan and one of our other\nsecurity centric gurus here were talking\n\n529\n00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.570\nabout a vulnerability that's been out\nthere in the wild for a very long time.\n\n530\n00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.030\nAnd Dan, you were mentioning how\nsystems aren't even patched yet.\n\n531\n00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.063\nAnd it's been around for a while,\n\n532\n00:27:43.063 --> 00:27:44.819\njust different attacks that\nhave been out there, right?\n\n533\n00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:46.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so funny.\n\n534\n00:27:46.277 --> 00:27:51.023\nOne of the biggest problems in IT\nwhen it comes to security is the fact\n\n535\n00:27:51.023 --> 00:27:54.117\nthat they don't have a good patching plan.\n\n536\n00:27:54.117 --> 00:27:55.006\nThey don't do it.\n\n537\n00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:58.665\nThey just aren't employing going,\non this day of every month or\n\n538\n00:27:58.665 --> 00:28:01.950\nevery time patches come out,\nwe're gonna deploy them.\n\n539\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.560\nThey are letting patches go and\ngo and go and\n\n540\n00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.620\nnot updating their patches to their\nsoftware or their operating systems.\n\n541\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.420\nAnd that's what is allowing old\nthings that have been around forever\n\n542\n00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.700\nto continue to be a problem.\n\n543\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.308\nAll you have to do is really\nstart patching and then,\n\n544\n00:28:17.308 --> 00:28:19.668\non top of that is using\nthings like antivirus.\n\n545\n00:28:19.668 --> 00:28:23.780\nThose two one-two punches right there\ncan really help mitigate a lot of your\n\n546\n00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.140\nsecurity footprint.\n\n547\n00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, so I want to\nre-stress that just like Dan said.\n\n548\n00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:30.926\nPatch management and\nanti-malware software,\n\n549\n00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:32.921\nhave both of them going on, right?\n\n550\n00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:34.663\nThat's-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And update the two.\n\n551\n00:28:34.663 --> 00:28:36.044\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and update exactly.\n\n552\n00:28:36.044 --> 00:28:36.655\n&gt;&gt; Update your antivirus definitions.\n\n553\n00:28:36.655 --> 00:28:38.971\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Patch your antivirus.\n\n554\n00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:41.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, always a good idea.\n\n555\n00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.440\n&gt;&gt; It's a one, two punch.\n\n556\n00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.832\nSo just remember that when we talk about\nzero-day exploits, right, that's when,\n\n557\n00:28:46.832 --> 00:28:50.628\nnot only is a vulnerability discovered but\nit's actually exploitable.\n\n558\n00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:54.410\nAnd the exploit is in the wild, but\nthe vendors remain unaware, right?\n\n559\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.860\nThey have to do something about\nit to get the systems patched.\n\n560\n00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.225\nAll right, last couple of things, Dan,\n\n561\n00:28:59.225 --> 00:29:01.690\nI know we're coming to the end of this\nepisode, that do I wanna talk about.\n\n562\n00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.810\nThere are some password, and I don't\nreally have a diagram for this one, but\n\n563\n00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.403\nthere are password attached, right?\n\n564\n00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:09.510\nWe've talked about in other\nepisodes about strong passwords.\n\n565\n00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:13.358\nWe'll see in additional episodes on\nexactly how to implement strong passwords.\n\n566\n00:29:13.358 --> 00:29:17.740\nAnd some of the things that we can do to\nincrease the resiliency to password-based\n\n567\n00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.320\nattacks.\n\n568\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.614\nBut I just wanna talk just briefly about\nsome of the password attacks that you have\n\n569\n00:29:21.614 --> 00:29:22.589\nout there, all right?\n\n570\n00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:24.640\nYou have what's known as\na brute force attack.\n\n571\n00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.950\nAnd a brute force attack\ntakes some CPU strength.\n\n572\n00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:31.670\nAnd this is where your computer rifles\nthrough every type of combination that it\n\n573\n00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:36.830\ncan, trying to guess the password or\ntrying to crack the password, if you will.\n\n574\n00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:41.360\nBut that does take a little bit of, a lot\nof bit of computational power, right?\n\n575\n00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.240\nYou have to some CPU strength.\n\n576\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.670\nThe other thing that you have is you can\nactually pre-load things like dictionary\n\n577\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.290\nwords and people use what are known as\nforbidden character strings, right?\n\n578\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.278\nYou shouldn't be using dictionary words.\n\n579\n00:29:52.278 --> 00:29:56.409\nBecause what people can do is use\na database of dictionary words.\n\n580\n00:29:56.409 --> 00:29:59.280\nAnd they can run the password\nagainst these dictionary words.\n\n581\n00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.160\nAnd they're trying to, again,\nbasically crack the password,\n\n582\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.638\nif it has dictionary words in it, right?\n\n583\n00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:08.100\nThat's a dictionary attack,\nand there are more.\n\n584\n00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.953\nThese are just some of the basic\nones that we talk about in A+.\n\n585\n00:30:11.953 --> 00:30:16.877\nAs you go on to more advanced training,\nyou're gonna learn more about some of\n\n586\n00:30:16.877 --> 00:30:21.425\nthese other password attacks that\ncan get really, really specific and\n\n587\n00:30:21.425 --> 00:30:23.300\ncan get complex.\n\n588\n00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.140\nThen you have one of the most\nbasic password attacks, and\n\n589\n00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.610\nthat's just sheer guessing, right?\n\n590\n00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.870\nTrying to guess what you\nthink the password is,\n\n591\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.410\nit might be based on profiling.\n\n592\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.400\nYou might look at a person and\n\n593\n00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.610\nsay, I know that's their favorite\nbaseball team or football team.\n\n594\n00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.749\nThey happen to be an animal lover,\nmaybe I'll guess what their cat's name is.\n\n595\n00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:39.992\nThere's things like social engineering,\nas well.\n\n596\n00:30:39.992 --> 00:30:41.618\n&gt;&gt; Defaults.\n&gt;&gt; Defaults?\n\n597\n00:30:41.618 --> 00:30:42.912\n&gt;&gt; Defaults,\nthat's the big one right there?\n\n598\n00:30:42.912 --> 00:30:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Defaults.\n&gt;&gt; People leave the default usernames and\n\n599\n00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.990\npasswords to all sorts of things.\n\n600\n00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.298\nAlways try the defaults.\n\n601\n00:30:48.298 --> 00:30:49.510\nIf you don't know what they are,\n\n602\n00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.310\nyou can consult the oracle of\nthe Internet we call Google.\n\n603\n00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:57.000\nAnd it it will tell you the default\npassword for a Linksys router is admin and\n\n604\n00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.180\npass, right, or whatever.\n\n605\n00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.390\nSo defaults, always try those\nwhen you're doing guessing.\n\n606\n00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.990\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\nit's a scary thing.\n\n607\n00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.480\nThat's why when we talk about hardening\nsystems, hardening systems is\n\n608\n00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.869\nsteering away from the defaults,\nchanging those default passwords.\n\n609\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.406\nAll right,\n\n610\n00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:17.822\nlast two things that I wanna kinda what\nto mention is non-compliant systems.\n\n611\n00:31:17.822 --> 00:31:24.170\nCompliant systems are ones that pass\nthe security configuration test.\n\n612\n00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:28.530\nAnd there's software out there, it could\nbe compliant to a security policy.\n\n613\n00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:33.980\nIf they steer away from a security policy,\nagain, they become a non-compliant system.\n\n614\n00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.576\nViolations of security best practices,\nright?\n\n615\n00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:40.254\nSteering away from the defaults,\nchanging default password.\n\n616\n00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:43.020\nNot using weak password.\n\n617\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.480\nNot writing passwords down.\n\n618\n00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.730\nNot using dictionary\nwords in your passwords.\n\n619\n00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:53.260\nAgain, keep in mind all of these are\nexamples of threats and vulnerabilities.\n\n620\n00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.010\nAnd it's threats and vulnerabilities\nyou wanna make sure you stay away from.\n\n621\n00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:00.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, this is definitely one\nof those very sobering episodes when it\n\n622\n00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.320\ncomes to computing.\n\n623\n00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.720\nBut it is a very necessary\nconversation to have,\n\n624\n00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.840\nbecause security is an issue nowadays.\n\n625\n00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.240\nAnd if you're not staying\non top of things, well,\n\n626\n00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.760\nyou're just basically\nasking to be exploited.\n\n627\n00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.760\nSo take some of these threats and\nvulnerabilities that we've gone through.\n\n628\n00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.400\nUnderstand how they can be a threat or\na vulnerability to you and your system.\n\n629\n00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.630\nAnd then start learning how you\ncan mitigate those threats.\n\n630\n00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.520\nLots of good stuff here, Wes,\nwe do thank you for talking us through it.\n\n631\n00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.720\nWe thank our good audience\nmembers out there for watching.\n\n632\n00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.771\nBut guess what, folks?\n\n633\n00:32:28.771 --> 00:32:30.965\nIt's that time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n634\n00:32:30.965 --> 00:32:32.305\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n635\n00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:33.684\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n636\n00:32:33.684 --> 00:32:34.738\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n637\n00:32:34.738 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:06.107\nWelcome to ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:08.408\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:12.840\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.601\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.131\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.225\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:21.780\nit is all about our A+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.420\nAnd what would a day be like without A+,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050\nIt's a fun, fun topic, and\nif you're getting started on IT,\n\n10\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.530\nit's where you gotta\nkind of get things going.\n\n11\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.928\nAnd joining us in the studio to help us\nget that ball rolling, our good friend,\n\n12\n00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:33.660\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.760\nWes, we're glad to have you man,\nhow is it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.620\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.280\nExcited to be here, that's right, we are\nmoving along in this series that is 902.\n\n16\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.820\nAnd well, we're gonna talk about\ncommon preventative methods, measures,\n\n17\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.090\nmethods if you will [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.620\nThe method to the madness.\n\n19\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.570\nWe're gonna talk about how you can\nkeep physical security in check and\n\n20\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200\nwe're also gonna talk about\ndigital security as well.\n\n21\n00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.720\nCuz it is going to be important.\n\n22\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.780\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're really just gonna dive right in,\n\n23\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.120\nthere are a lot of different ways\nthat we can secure our systems.\n\n24\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.080\nKeep in mind that physical security\nis very, very important, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.440\nAt the end of the day, we can do things\nlike we can encrypt our information,\n\n26\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.970\nscrambling it in a way that you know only\nthe authorized people have access to it.\n\n27\n00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870\n&gt;&gt; But Microsoft has\nan interesting saying out there.\n\n28\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.380\nI think they're called\nthe Ten Immutable Laws of Security,\n\n29\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.740\nthat Microsoft came up with.\n\n30\n00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.170\nAnd it's probably a military thing.\n\n31\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.480\nA lot of the security that we talk about\nin digital security, in information\n\n32\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.610\nsystems, really started with things\nlike the United States military.\n\n33\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.700\nAnd what I'm talking about is,\nif I can touch your computer, guess what?\n\n34\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.440\nIt's really no longer your computer.\n\n35\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.560\nIf I can run a piece of\nsoftware on your network.\n\n36\n00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.760\nGuess what?\n\n37\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.130\nIt's really no longer your network.\n\n38\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.620\nIf I have physical access to your network,\nit's no longer your network.\n\n39\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.160\nRight now I definitely put my own\nspin on those Immutable Laws.\n\n40\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.700\nBut it comes down to it, that we can\ndo all the things that we want to.\n\n41\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.270\nWe can implement authentication systems.\n\n42\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.150\nWe can make sure that\nour data is scrambled.\n\n43\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.860\nBut in the end of the day,\nif people can walk into your building and\n\n44\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.250\nthey can gain access to your systems,\nhow much have you really secured?\n\n45\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.868\nSo we have to keep in mind that one of\nthe first layers of defense is always user\n\n46\n00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:15.540\nawareness and education.\n\n47\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.868\nBut then that second line of defense is\nthe physical security that you need to\n\n48\n00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:20.420\nimplement within your system.\n\n49\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.815\n&gt;&gt; Wes, this is where they commonly refer\nto this as, what is it, Gates, Guards,\n\n50\n00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:26.573\nand Guns kind of thing, right?\n\n51\n00:02:26.573 --> 00:02:27.448\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n52\n00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:30.322\n&gt;&gt; When we say physical, we mean you\nactually put your hands on this, right?\n\n53\n00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:34.110\nThere is a physical fence blocking\nyou from accessing the server.\n\n54\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.495\nAnd there's a door with a lock in place\nblocking you from access to some sensitive\n\n55\n00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:39.270\nmaterial.\n\n56\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.910\nThere might actually even be a man with\na gun standing next to these things and\n\n57\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.600\ndoing a patrol around the perimeter.\n\n58\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.955\nTo make sure that you aren't\ngaining access to these things.\n\n59\n00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:53.155\nBecause, like Wes said, if you gain access\nto it, if you can put your hands on it and\n\n60\n00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:56.395\nstart doing things, even if it's\njust pull the power out of it,\n\n61\n00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:59.589\nnow you've denial-of-service\nattacked the crap out of me.\n\n62\n00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.750\n[LAUGH] And no one's gaining access,\nyou've successfully implemented that.\n\n63\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.430\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and another way to\nthink of it, too, in the military,\n\n64\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.040\nthey called it defense in depth.\n\n65\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.020\nRight, we call it defense in depth,\nI mean,\n\n66\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.690\nyou hear it called defense in depth\nif you go up to any Microsoft sites,\n\n67\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.090\nthey've coined the phrase, but that really\nstarted with the United States military.\n\n68\n00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.960\nYou've got to have perimeter security,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.070\nYou have to have physical security\nwithin your buildings, and well,\n\n70\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.350\nlet's start right where Dan did, right?\n\n71\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.270\nWith security guards.\n\n72\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.100\nSecurity guards are not on the list, but\nI do want to talk about security guards,\n\n73\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.360\nand I'm gonna mention a couple that\naren't on this list that you're gonna\n\n74\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.330\nsee as you progress to things like\nNetwork Plus and definitely Security Plus.\n\n75\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.990\nBecause while In Security Plus,\nit's all about security, right?\n\n76\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.240\nWell, what's your first line of defense?\n\n77\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.480\nWell, a lot of times it's a locked door,\nright?\n\n78\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.280\nLocked doors are very,\nvery important, right?\n\n79\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.030\nA locked door creates some kind\nof physical barrier that's not\n\n80\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.930\neasily accessible without\nsome kind of force.\n\n81\n00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.300\nNow, you guys out there that have lock\npicks, and maybe know how to do the whole\n\n82\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.630\nshim within the door, understand that\nI know nothing is 100% secure, right.\n\n83\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.400\nYou ask me to show you\na 100% secure location and\n\n84\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.830\nI'll tell you that one doesn't exist,\nall right.\n\n85\n00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.430\nBut understand that's your first line of\ndefense, and then behind that door or\n\n86\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.990\nmaybe even in front of that door\ncould be a security guard, right.\n\n87\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.930\nNow, whether a security guard has a gun or\nnot, well, it's dependent on what\n\n88\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.132\nclassification they have you know, what's\nthe level of necessity for security.\n\n89\n00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:28.527\nBut one of the things that all\nsecurity guards have in common is\n\n90\n00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:32.920\nthe fact that they can react in real time\nto any situation that happens, right.\n\n91\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.130\nWhether it be somebody that they can\nphysically see in front of them walking up\n\n92\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.424\nto that secure door, or\n\n93\n00:04:38.424 --> 00:04:42.799\nwhether it be monitored on some kind of\nclosed circuit television, all right.\n\n94\n00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:47.154\nThe other thing about a security guard is\nthe fact that they can respond in real\n\n95\n00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:48.100\ntime to alarms.\n\n96\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.440\nAll right,\nI want you to think about it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.828\nAlarms are something that you\nhave to keep in mind, too.\n\n98\n00:04:51.828 --> 00:04:57.000\nBut alarms, an alarm makes somebody aware,\nif they're in the physical location.\n\n99\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.540\nAnd if they're not in the physical\nlocation you do have monitoring systems\n\n100\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.214\nthat can produce alarms and\nwhat do they do?\n\n101\n00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:07.579\nThey call the first responders, people\nlike your law enforcement agency but\n\n102\n00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:11.046\nif you've got somebody in the building\nthat is already there that can respond to\n\n103\n00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:13.810\nthat alarm, they can respond in real time.\n\n104\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.951\nNow, security guards and alarms aren't\nreally in the objectives when it comes to\n\n105\n00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.612\nphysical security but they are definitely\nyour first line of defense and\n\n106\n00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:24.391\nalso locked doors,\nnow locked doors are, all right.\n\n107\n00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:26.877\nAnd there's different types of\nlocks that you have out there and\n\n108\n00:05:26.877 --> 00:05:30.560\nwe certainly don't wanna get into a whole\nlocksmith episode by any means but.\n\n109\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.520\nYou have things that require like smart\ncards, right, smart card authentication.\n\n110\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.815\nNow smart cards are,\nif you will, on the exam, and\n\n111\n00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:42.350\nwe all have smart cards here as I try\nto dig this out of my pocket, here.\n\n112\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.410\nI've got one in my back pocket that\nis giving me a hard time coming out.\n\n113\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.780\nBut we all have smart cards, right?\n\n114\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.690\nAnd this little card,\nI swipe and it allows me, or\n\n115\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.140\nin this case, I just touch it to\nthe electronic pad and it opens the door.\n\n116\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.980\nRight, it's got a little cylinder in it\nthat releases and I can open the door.\n\n117\n00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.930\nAll right, now you also have\nother types of cards, too.\n\n118\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.923\nYou have things that are called RFID fob.\n\n119\n00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:09.065\nAnd I'm going to end up taking everything\nout of my pockets in this episode, Dan.\n\n120\n00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:09.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n121\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.050\nyou guys just bear with me here\nbecause we do have quite a few cards.\n\n122\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.590\nNow this one's a little bit different,\nall right?\n\n123\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.810\nYou can't really tell it, but\nthat is a lot thicker, right?\n\n124\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.790\nBy comparison, to some of the other\ncards that I have, right?\n\n125\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.380\nSo what's the difference between\nan RFID card and a smart card?\n\n126\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.090\nWell, sometimes smart cards\ndo have chips on them,\n\n127\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.880\nsometimes they just have a little\nmagnetic strip built into them.\n\n128\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.340\nBut if you look, this one is\nconsiderably thicker, all right?\n\n129\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.700\nAnd I don't know, in fact,\nI'll hand that to Dan.\n\n130\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.140\nDan, can you see that that's\nactually two pieces of plastic?\n\n131\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.620\nClipped together, right?\n\n132\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.670\nAnd you could actually separate it,\nplease dont.\n\n133\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.854\n&gt;&gt; I've actually done it, before.\n\n134\n00:06:47.854 --> 00:06:48.362\n&gt;&gt; Have you?\n\n135\n00:06:48.362 --> 00:06:49.171\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\n\n136\n00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:51.443\ndon't separate that, or I wont be\nable to get in my apartment complex.\n\n137\n00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:52.785\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE] Let me show you what's inside!\n\n138\n00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:55.485\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the difference here is that\n\n139\n00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:58.890\nthey can have some kind of\nlogical circuitry in them, right.\n\n140\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.200\nAnd in this fact, it's got a little chip\nin it that's actually programmed and\n\n141\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.490\nit's matched to my account\nat my apartment complex.\n\n142\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.280\nRight, these are also forms of access.\n\n143\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.870\nYou have things like smart\ncard authentication.\n\n144\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.520\nNow smart card could be something\nthat's like, what is it, CAC card?\n\n145\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.740\nYou have in the military, you have what's\nknown as a CAC card, Common Access Card.\n\n146\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:23.026\nAnd in that common access card,\nit has pretty much the military officer or\n\n147\n00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:27.620\nenlisted official,\nit has their entire information within it.\n\n148\n00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.900\nGovernment officials also have their own\npersonally identifiable card too that\n\n149\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.990\nthey have.\n\n150\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.310\nNow depending on how sophisticated your\nmachines or your security system is,\n\n151\n00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.400\nyou could have things like key fobs\nthat are a lot like the RFID sensors.\n\n152\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.146\nRFID by the way,\nsorry to hit you guys with an acronym and\n\n153\n00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:49.899\nnot explain what it is, we're talking\nabout Radio Frequency IDentifier.\n\n154\n00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:54.519\nAll right, and what they are, sometimes\nthey can also be called proximity cards as\n\n155\n00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.479\nwell, and I know that you'll see\npeople call them interchangeably and\n\n156\n00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:02.307\nsometimes they'll say hey technically\nthere's a difference, but\n\n157\n00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:06.380\nwith an RFID A key fob or an RFID\ncard itself or a badge, if you will.\n\n158\n00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.960\nYou just basically gotta get within\nproximity of the device, the sensor and\n\n159\n00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.260\nit authenticates you.\n\n160\n00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.350\nAll right, so, these are also things you\ncan have inside of your devices when\n\n161\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.160\nit comes to or for\nyour physical security as well.\n\n162\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.380\nOther things that you have,\ntoo, you have tokens.\n\n163\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.290\nNow, tokens can be physical or\nthey could be software based, all right?\n\n164\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.600\nAnd when we say tokens,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n165\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.890\nA token really contains things like\na personally identifiable number,\n\n166\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.930\nit could be user name, could be a little\nbit of temporary information too\n\n167\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.070\nthat changes every once in a while.\n\n168\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.790\nAnd it could match up to some\nphysical device that you\n\n169\n00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.270\nhave that has a four digit code.\n\n170\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.280\nBut a token, essentially is a Is another\nway you authenticate yourself, all right?\n\n171\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.538\nAnd the reason I say physical is it could\nbe that you do have devices that have\n\n172\n00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:59.459\ntokens that are in cards as well some\nof that logical information I was\n\n173\n00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:00.290\ntelling you.\n\n174\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.009\nBut you also have software based tokens,\nwhere might I find software based tokens?\n\n175\n00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:08.375\nWell in a past episode we've talked about\nthe Windows security system known as\n\n176\n00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:09.820\nthe user account control.\n\n177\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.740\nWell the user account control,\nwhen you create a user account inside of\n\n178\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.350\nWindows you get assigned two tokens to\nyour account if you're an administrator.\n\n179\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.540\nAll right it you are a standard\nuser you only get one token.\n\n180\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.310\nBut if you are an administrator\nyou get two tokens all right.\n\n181\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.690\nAnd what happens is administrators,\nwhen they are running and\n\n182\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.750\nthey do not need administrative\nprivileges, they run as a standard user.\n\n183\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.280\nAnd their standard token applies to there\nand gives them the lower privilege access.\n\n184\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.620\nNow the moment you trigger the user\naccount control and it blocks you and\n\n185\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.750\nsays you have to interact with it in\norder to perform this functionality.\n\n186\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.250\nWell you either have to put\nin a username or password or\n\n187\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.630\nyou have to click continue in\norder to elevate your privileges.\n\n188\n00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.780\nAnd when you elevate your privileges what\nhappens is a software, a logical token,\n\n189\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.360\ngets applied to your account and\n\n190\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.180\nthen you perform your\nadministrative functionalities.\n\n191\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.940\nAnd while you're performing those\nadministrative functionalities that\n\n192\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.360\nsoftware based token is\napplied to your user account.\n\n193\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.780\nBut then when you no longer need those\nprivileges silently in the background,\n\n194\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.350\nunder the hood in the operating\nsystem Windows goes, all right,\n\n195\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.390\nlet's switch this back out.\n\n196\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.650\nWe'll put your standard token back on.\n\n197\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.260\nThat's why you can see\nin multiple instances in\n\n198\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:23.020\na single login session, the user account\ncontrol will trigger many different times.\n\n199\n00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.850\nBecause it doesn't run,\n\n200\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.790\nyou can continuously with that\nadministrative token, all right.\n\n201\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.199\nIt's called a privilege escalation.\n\n202\n00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:34.274\nNow there are attacks where people\ntry to do privilege escalation right?\n\n203\n00:10:34.274 --> 00:10:38.849\nWe talk about rootkits, rootkits got the\nname cuz originally what they would do is\n\n204\n00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:42.163\nthey would try to run as a root\nuser in the Nix based systems,\n\n205\n00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.520\nUnix systems, right?\n\n206\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.940\nWell, today we call root kits, because\nthey still try to gain privileged access,\n\n207\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.180\nbut if you will, what they're trying to do\nis maybe not the same thing .And obviously\n\n208\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.990\nin Windows, because there isn't a root\nuser account, but keep in mind, right,\n\n209\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.720\nthat's what happens.\n\n210\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.170\nA privilege escalation happens, your\nsoftware based token gets applied to your\n\n211\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.710\nuser account and then, in the background,\nwhen you no longer need those privileges,\n\n212\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:07.680\nWindows reduces your privileges\nback down to the least amount.\n\n213\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.790\nNow that also comes to common prevention\nmethods that we do have to talk\n\n214\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.630\nabout that are in the list.\n\n215\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.010\nIt's called the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n216\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.990\nSo what is the principle\nof least privilege?\n\n217\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.051\nWell that means that if you\ndon't need those privileges to\n\n218\n00:11:21.051 --> 00:11:25.311\ndo your daily job you're not gonna gain\naccess to it you're not gonna get those.\n\n219\n00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:28.553\n&gt;&gt; It's funny [COUGH] Mike and I were\ntalking this morning about crazy security\n\n220\n00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:31.087\nthings that we've encountered\nthroughout our careers.\n\n221\n00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:33.247\nOne was where I worked at\na place that I worked and\n\n222\n00:11:33.247 --> 00:11:36.230\nI'm not gonna mention any names\nbecause it was pretty horrible.\n\n223\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.940\nThe domain account was H desk and\nthe password for it was HELP.\n\n224\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; And everybody knew what it was.\n\n225\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.949\nand Mike said he knew a guy that called\nhim up and went to work for a company and\n\n226\n00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:52.500\nevery user, and this was in\na windows active directory domain,\n\n227\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.120\nevery user was a domain admin.\n\n228\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.180\nThese are bad security\npractices ladies and gentlemen.\n\n229\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.530\nIt's like we were just talking about\nwhere you have the two tokens A,\n\n230\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.070\nif you're just a standard user,\nyou don't need.\n\n231\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.400\nThat's why you have people like us and\n\n232\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.410\nyourself one day to do these things for\nyou.\n\n233\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.430\nYou call, and say I need access to this,\nI need you to do this for me.\n\n234\n00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.440\nThat's what they get paid to do.\n\n235\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.960\nYou don't give everybody\nthe keys to the kingdom because\n\n236\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.470\nthen everybody has keys to the kingdom and\nthey can hurt you, right?\n\n237\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.110\nSo you want to keep that privilege\ndown to just who actually needs it?\n\n238\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.280\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nthat's one of the reasons Windows,\n\n239\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.270\nI say Windows basically\ngave birth to the UAC.\n\n240\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.150\nBut what really happened was\nWindows came on board with what\n\n241\n00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.450\nwas already happening with things like\nyour Unix and Linux-based systems.\n\n242\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.140\nIf you don't need route user\naccess don't use it, right.\n\n243\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.140\nSo principle least privilege says that we\ngive you just the privileges that you need\n\n244\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.050\nto perform your day to day job,\nno more, no less, right.\n\n245\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.300\nAnd it's not until you need\nthose privileges that,\n\n246\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.490\nif you're a standard user,\nyou make a phone call.\n\n247\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.580\nIf you're an administrator,\nyou get a privilege escalation,\n\n248\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.831\nwhichever one happens first.\n\n249\n00:12:57.831 --> 00:13:01.230\nAll right so some of the other things that\nwe also have to keep in mind are things\n\n250\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.910\nlike cable locks, all right?\n\n251\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.150\nWhen we talk about cable locks, I do want\nyou to understand that there are a few\n\n252\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.650\ndifferent kinds that you have out there.\n\n253\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.410\nAnd when it comes to cable locks,\nand in fact, let me go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.180\nshow you what I mean.\n\n255\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.848\nI've kind of pulled up a website here.\n\n256\n00:13:14.848 --> 00:13:17.790\nLet's give tryten their credit here,\nbecause it is their image, and\n\n257\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.730\nyou can always have they're\nnot very expensive.\n\n258\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.480\nAnd like I said,\nlet's give credit to where credit's due.\n\n259\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.320\nAnd you can see that it's a locking\nmechanism that actually physically\n\n260\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.960\nlocks the machine down to the desk, right?\n\n261\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.630\nNow even more so, you need this in\nthings like laptops because why?\n\n262\n00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.840\nLaptops are mobile, right?\n\n263\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.250\nPortability is key to a laptop.\n\n264\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.470\nWell I don't want a laptop just\nbeing able to grow legs and\n\n265\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.220\nwalk out the door, if you will.\n\n266\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.010\nSo, Noble Locks here, and again, giving\nthem credit because this is their website,\n\n267\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:49.780\nand their pictures.\n\n268\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.370\nThey have some great ones here, for\nthings like iPads, and for instance,\n\n269\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.860\nlike this MacBook Pro.\n\n270\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.580\nThis is a really, really cool setup.\n\n271\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.810\nLook how it just locks right\nto the MacBook itself, and\n\n272\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.040\nthen you have a lock on the back.\n\n273\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.360\nAll right, you could also hear sometimes\nthey are called Kingston locks too,\n\n274\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.280\nyou have then likewise.\n\n275\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.180\nNow some of the other things that we have,\nwe have what are known as\n\n276\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.655\nprivacy filters and I'll go ahead and\nshow you a privacy filter.\n\n277\n00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:16.165\nHere's one from 3M by CD,\nW here you can also\n\n278\n00:14:16.165 --> 00:14:20.505\nno that's okay I don't have any\nquestions I know what I'm looking at.\n\n279\n00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:24.935\nIf you look here a privacy filter is\nreally good now privacy filters can also\n\n280\n00:14:24.935 --> 00:14:28.997\nbe called anti glare filters,\nfor obvious reasons, right?\n\n281\n00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:29.767\nCutting down the glare.\n\n282\n00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:32.627\nBut one of the great things\nabout privacy filters is\n\n283\n00:14:32.627 --> 00:14:34.467\nwe talk about social engineering.\n\n284\n00:14:34.467 --> 00:14:37.987\nAnd we'll definitely talk about it in\nour security section a little bit more.\n\n285\n00:14:37.987 --> 00:14:41.900\nNot right here in this security episode,\nbut, social engineering, one of the best,\n\n286\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.040\none of the easiest things that you can\ndo is look over somebody's shoulder.\n\n287\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.970\nShoulder surfing, right?\n\n288\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.360\nAnd I could find out what you're doing.\n\n289\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.270\nMaybe see what kind of\npassword you're typing in.\n\n290\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.580\nOr, maybe the documents that\nyou're working with, and\n\n291\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.260\nget some good personal identifiable\ninformation, or even some PHIs.\n\n292\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.290\nYou know,\nsome protected healthcare information.\n\n293\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.850\nWell you put one of these privacy filters\nover there and it kind of brings your\n\n294\n00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.300\ncomputer display back to the earlier\npassive matrix screens that didn't have\n\n295\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.400\na wide viewing angle you literally had\nto sit right in front of them, right?\n\n296\n00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.900\nSo that's what a privacy filter is, like I\nsaid you might even see them called anti\n\n297\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.710\nglare filters but\nthey can be used for either or.\n\n298\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.540\nAll right,\nas far as physical security goes,\n\n299\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.290\nsome of the last couple of\nthings that we gotta talk about.\n\n300\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.320\nThey talk about securing physical\ndocuments, passwords, and\n\n301\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.260\nshredding, all right?\n\n302\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.540\nWhen it comes to passwords, there\nare a few different things that we can do.\n\n303\n00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, my previous thing I was\ntalking about, where the username and\n\n304\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.680\npassword for the domain admin account\nwas hdesk and the password was help.\n\n305\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.652\nI'm guessing help is a bad example\nof a secure or strong password.\n\n306\n00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That is a very bad example.\n\n307\n00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.430\nLet's just understand because well,\nmore than one person knew it.\n\n308\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.650\nLet alone, how strong it was, right?\n\n309\n00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.962\nWe look in security,right and I don't\nknow if they're gonna call this out.\n\n310\n00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:03.975\nBut let's go ahead and address the three\nprinciples of security, right?\n\n311\n00:16:03.975 --> 00:16:08.170\nConfidentiality, integrity and\navailability, all right?\n\n312\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.619\nConfidentiality is making sure only the\nauthorized people have access to the data\n\n313\n00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:14.492\nor the systems that hold the data.\n\n314\n00:16:14.492 --> 00:16:20.283\nIntegrity is making sure that it\nmaintains its original state, right?\n\n315\n00:16:20.283 --> 00:16:22.303\nMaintains its integrity.\n\n316\n00:16:22.303 --> 00:16:26.378\nAnd availability, again is making sure\nthat authorized users have access to it.\n\n317\n00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:29.137\nNow there's a fourth one in there\nthat's kinda like a cousin, and\n\n318\n00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:31.169\nthat's called Non-Repudiation, all right?\n\n319\n00:16:31.169 --> 00:16:34.841\nWe wanna have some kind of\naccountability where I say, hey Dan,\n\n320\n00:16:34.841 --> 00:16:36.613\nthat was your communication.\n\n321\n00:16:36.613 --> 00:16:39.215\nI don't want Dan to be able to say,\nit wasn't me.\n\n322\n00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:43.202\nWell, when you've got something like\nthat where everybody knows the password.\n\n323\n00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:46.573\nRight away, that means I can't\ntell who did what, right?\n\n324\n00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.083\nI can't say hey, Dan, that was you.\n\n325\n00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:51.383\nDan could say, I wasn't even in\nthe state at that time, right?\n\n326\n00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:55.863\nWell, yeah it was, I seen your username or\nwhatever was logged in here.\n\n327\n00:16:55.863 --> 00:16:56.717\nWell, you know what?\n\n328\n00:16:56.717 --> 00:17:01.037\nSally's also got it, Bob's got it,\nBill's got it as well, all right?\n\n329\n00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:07.339\nSo first of all sharing passwords is not a\ngood way to protect your documents, right?\n\n330\n00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.085\nSo let's talk about strong passwords.\n\n331\n00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:13.398\nSo don't share and\nhelp is definitely a bad password.\n\n332\n00:17:13.398 --> 00:17:15.350\nSo what constitutes a strong password?\n\n333\n00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.835\nI've got a few examples of what\nyou can do here, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:17.835 --> 00:17:21.448\nOne of the things we need to\nunderstand is that first of all,\n\n335\n00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:23.989\nit's resilient to attacks, all right?\n\n336\n00:17:23.989 --> 00:17:26.187\nI will show you how to\nget there in a second.\n\n337\n00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:27.936\nResilient to password-based attacks.\n\n338\n00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:32.832\nThere's all different kinds and we'll talk\nabout those coming up in another episode.\n\n339\n00:17:32.832 --> 00:17:35.072\nAll right they're changed regularly,\nall right?\n\n340\n00:17:35.072 --> 00:17:38.630\nWe don't want the same\npassword such as help being\n\n341\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.772\nthe password all the time day in and\nday out.\n\n342\n00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:42.583\nWhy is that?\n\n343\n00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:45.879\nWell it gives hackers all the time\nthey need to attack it, right?\n\n344\n00:17:45.879 --> 00:17:50.401\nAnd we want it resilient,\nwe want to stand up against attacks.\n\n345\n00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:51.703\n&gt;&gt; Passwords are like underwear [LAUGH].\n\n346\n00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:52.888\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nchange them regularly, right?\n\n347\n00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Change them regularly.\n\n348\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.993\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's the same thing as\njocks change their socks before.\n\n349\n00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.405\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n350\n00:17:58.405 --> 00:18:00.823\n&gt;&gt; You don't wear the same socks unless\nthey feel flies are lucky, right?\n\n351\n00:18:00.823 --> 00:18:01.516\n&gt;&gt; That's right, feel flies are lucky.\n\n352\n00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:03.277\n&gt;&gt; We've heard that before, right?\n\n353\n00:18:03.277 --> 00:18:07.905\n[LAUGH] Multiple character sets, and we'll\ntalk about the character sets coming up.\n\n354\n00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.357\nIncreased characters length,\nnow some of you guys and\n\n355\n00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:12.979\ngals out there are probably\nalready security-centric.\n\n356\n00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:17.116\nSo please, let's not go down the path of\nwhether increased character lengths versus\n\n357\n00:18:17.116 --> 00:18:18.672\ncomplexity is better or worse.\n\n358\n00:18:18.672 --> 00:18:20.819\nBut, If I have help right?\n\n359\n00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:23.145\nWhat is that H-E-L-P, That's four letters.\n\n360\n00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:26.178\nWhile that's probably\nnot as strong is even,\n\n361\n00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:30.778\nlet's just basically said help,\nthe word help three times, right?\n\n362\n00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:32.350\nYou've got a longer password.\n\n363\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.529\nAll right, keep in mind, and these\nare typically controlled through policies.\n\n364\n00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:38.404\nAll right, very basically, understand\nthat they're controlled in a corporate\n\n365\n00:18:38.404 --> 00:18:39.998\nenvironment, unless it was Dan's old job.\n\n366\n00:18:39.998 --> 00:18:41.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We changed that, by the way.\n\n367\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.509\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you change that, right?\n\n368\n00:18:43.509 --> 00:18:45.590\n&gt;&gt; That implementation went out asap.\n\n369\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.306\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n370\n00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:48.062\nthey're typically controlled\nthrough a policy.\n\n371\n00:18:48.062 --> 00:18:51.891\nSo, all right, let's understand\nthe multiple character sets.\n\n372\n00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:54.046\nThat's something that you\ndefinitely wanna know.\n\n373\n00:18:54.046 --> 00:18:58.106\nIf you're not aware about character sets,\nthere are four possible character sets\n\n374\n00:18:58.106 --> 00:19:01.006\non your keyboard if you look at\nthem at any time, all right?\n\n375\n00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:04.563\nWe have letters, but we have letters that\ncan be in two different states, right?\n\n376\n00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:06.632\nCapital letters versus lower case letters.\n\n377\n00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:08.541\nThose are two character sets.\n\n378\n00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:12.442\nWe also have numbers zero through nine,\nas well as special characters.\n\n379\n00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:14.173\nAnd there's a bunch of them, you guys and\n\n380\n00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:16.548\ngals out there can look down\nat your keyboard right now and\n\n381\n00:19:16.548 --> 00:19:19.387\nsee the various special characters\nthat you have on your keyboard.\n\n382\n00:19:19.387 --> 00:19:22.837\nWhen we change our passwords often,\n\n383\n00:19:22.837 --> 00:19:27.745\nwhen we require greater character length,\nright?\n\n384\n00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:30.565\nEight characters,\nnine characters, ten characters,\n\n385\n00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.275\nwhatever your company might use.\n\n386\n00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:36.137\nAnd then we require what's\nknown as password complexity.\n\n387\n00:19:36.137 --> 00:19:40.835\nComplexity means you're gonna use one\nof each one of these character sets.\n\n388\n00:19:40.835 --> 00:19:45.217\nNow, you start to get passwords that\nare a little bit more resilient or\n\n389\n00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.972\nstronger against password based attacks.\n\n390\n00:19:47.972 --> 00:19:51.147\nAll right and I can actually\nshow you in an operating system,\n\n391\n00:19:51.147 --> 00:19:55.017\nlet's see here I'm still logged in yep,\nwhere we control this, right?\n\n392\n00:19:55.017 --> 00:19:57.329\nNow keep in mind if you are in\na corporate environment,\n\n393\n00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.511\ncentralized server is probably where\nyou're gonna be controlling this.\n\n394\n00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:03.463\nBut the settings will be the same,\nthey will look the same, but\n\n395\n00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:06.207\nthey're gonna be controlled\nfrom a different location.\n\n396\n00:20:06.207 --> 00:20:10.050\nThe great thing is you can also control\nthem locally on your computers here as\n\n397\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.022\nwell, all right?\n\n398\n00:20:11.022 --> 00:20:13.510\nNow when Dan said we\nchange that policy asap,\n\n399\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.459\nlet me show you what he was talking about,\nall right?\n\n400\n00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:20.700\nSo if I drop down to and\nthat's a well drop down to the modern or\n\n401\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.706\nmetro UI and\nI'm gonna type something known as gp.msc.\n\n402\n00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:26.998\nAll right,\nthis is our group policy at right?\n\n403\n00:20:26.998 --> 00:20:31.188\nIn this case it's a local group policy\neditor, please understand ladies and\n\n404\n00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:34.807\ngentlemen, on the A+ exam are not\nexpected to know group policy.\n\n405\n00:20:34.807 --> 00:20:39.702\nHowever you might need to know about\npassword policy settings, all right?\n\n406\n00:20:39.702 --> 00:20:42.059\nHow we can to control that, all right?\n\n407\n00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:47.975\nAnd if I go into our local computer policy\nand I expand out computer configurations,\n\n408\n00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:51.489\nWindows Settings, and\nthen Security Settings.\n\n409\n00:20:51.489 --> 00:20:54.095\nNotice that we've got a couple\nof different things that we can\n\n410\n00:20:54.095 --> 00:20:55.005\ncontrol right here.\n\n411\n00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:57.490\nBut the one that I really wanna look at,\nright?\n\n412\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.399\nIs this Account Policies, remember\nwe are talking about user accounts.\n\n413\n00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:04.659\nAnd if I expand this out,\nI've got password policy, all right?\n\n414\n00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:06.818\nAnd if I expand that out,\nI've got absolutely nothing.\n\n415\n00:21:06.818 --> 00:21:09.532\nI've always loved that where you\nexpand that little triangle out and\n\n416\n00:21:09.532 --> 00:21:10.897\nit all does is makes it disappear.\n\n417\n00:21:10.897 --> 00:21:14.218\n[LAUGH] But\nif I go over here into the context pane,\n\n418\n00:21:14.218 --> 00:21:17.218\nI can see that enforcing password history.\n\n419\n00:21:17.218 --> 00:21:20.674\nPassword history just means how\nmany times do you have to come\n\n420\n00:21:20.674 --> 00:21:24.692\nup with a unique password before you\ncan use the password, all right?\n\n421\n00:21:24.692 --> 00:21:28.201\nMaximum password age is how long\nbefore I changed the password, right?\n\n422\n00:21:28.201 --> 00:21:33.003\nRegularly change this, again means\nyou're using a new unique password and\n\n423\n00:21:33.003 --> 00:21:35.864\nit makes it harder for\nthe hackers to attack.\n\n424\n00:21:35.864 --> 00:21:40.335\nMinimum password age is how long\ndo I have to use a password\n\n425\n00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:43.045\nbefore I came change, all right?\n\n426\n00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:46.814\nPassword length is really one that we\nwanna understand as to how many characters\n\n427\n00:21:46.814 --> 00:21:47.724\ndoes it have to be.\n\n428\n00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:51.665\nAnd password complexity means\nthose character sets, all right?\n\n429\n00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:56.201\nIf I implement password complexity,\nI've got to use those character sets,\n\n430\n00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:59.709\nand that again will increase\nthe strength of the password.\n\n431\n00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:03.335\nNow this one here, storing passwords\nusing reversible encryption.\n\n432\n00:22:03.335 --> 00:22:04.514\nI don't want you to worry about that one.\n\n433\n00:22:04.514 --> 00:22:06.257\nThat one is one that's not commonly used.\n\n434\n00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:10.798\nIt used to be that if a service\nneeded to authenticate as you,\n\n435\n00:22:10.798 --> 00:22:13.032\nneeded to use your password.\n\n436\n00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:16.893\nIt couldn't store it in a format\nthat was scrambled, right?\n\n437\n00:22:16.893 --> 00:22:19.709\nOr encrypted, as they say, right?\n\n438\n00:22:19.709 --> 00:22:22.052\nSo what they'd have to do is\nstore it in plain text and\n\n439\n00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:25.752\nthey've greatly reduced the security,\nso it's not one that's commonly used.\n\n440\n00:22:25.752 --> 00:22:28.602\nSo that is one of the ways that\nyou can protect documents.\n\n441\n00:22:28.602 --> 00:22:31.377\nNow they also talk about\nphysical documents too, right?\n\n442\n00:22:31.377 --> 00:22:35.362\nWhen we talk about physical documents, one\nof the ways that you protect that is you\n\n443\n00:22:35.362 --> 00:22:37.675\ndo implement things like\nretention policies,\n\n444\n00:22:37.675 --> 00:22:41.345\nyou make sure that documents aren't\njust sitting by the printer, right?\n\n445\n00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:45.145\nIf you're printing out things like payment\ncard information, that happens sometimes,\n\n446\n00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:47.252\nwhere people like to leave\nthings on the printer.\n\n447\n00:22:47.252 --> 00:22:51.613\nYou're making sure that they're kept and\nsecure, you might have a secure or\n\n448\n00:22:51.613 --> 00:22:55.907\nclean desk policy that says, all personal\ninformation has to be secured and\n\n449\n00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.539\nphysically locked as well.\n\n450\n00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:01.810\nAll right, some of the last things that\nwe have to talk about is when it comes to\n\n451\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.940\ndigital security.\n\n452\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.285\nWe've talked about user authentication,\nwe've talked about strong passwords,\n\n453\n00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:11.219\nhow about we talk about something\nknown as Multi-Factor Authentication?\n\n454\n00:23:11.219 --> 00:23:14.418\nWe talk about Multi-Factor Authentication,\nthere are three,\n\n455\n00:23:14.418 --> 00:23:17.742\nwell there's more than that today\njust as technology progresses.\n\n456\n00:23:17.742 --> 00:23:21.063\nBut there is primarily three main ones\nthat I want you to worry about when it\n\n457\n00:23:21.063 --> 00:23:22.524\ncomes authentication factor.\n\n458\n00:23:22.524 --> 00:23:27.802\nSomething you know, something you have and\nsomething you are, all right?\n\n459\n00:23:27.802 --> 00:23:30.482\nSomething you know is usually username and\npassword or\n\n460\n00:23:30.482 --> 00:23:32.819\nPIN Personal Identification Number, right?\n\n461\n00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:36.947\nSomething that you know you have to\nplug in could be a security question.\n\n462\n00:23:36.947 --> 00:23:38.876\nIf you ever had to answer\na security question,\n\n463\n00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:42.097\nthat's an example of something you know,\nit's an authentication factor.\n\n464\n00:23:42.097 --> 00:23:45.647\nSomething you have,\nwe've mentioned RFID key fobs or\n\n465\n00:23:45.647 --> 00:23:50.214\nRFID badges if you will, smart cards,\nit's something you possess.\n\n466\n00:23:50.214 --> 00:23:54.381\nLast one is something you are, right?\n\n467\n00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:57.873\nThis is some personal trait of yourself,\na physical characteristic and\n\n468\n00:23:57.873 --> 00:23:59.602\nthis is where biometrics comes in.\n\n469\n00:23:59.602 --> 00:24:03.177\nBiometrics used to be [LAUGH], when I\nfirst started teaching this, I would say\n\n470\n00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:06.975\nvery expensive implementation and only\nthe most secure places are gonna have it.\n\n471\n00:24:06.975 --> 00:24:09.484\nAnd now every one of our\nsmartphones pretty much,\n\n472\n00:24:09.484 --> 00:24:13.500\n[LAUGH] a lot of our smartphones have\nit built right into the device, right?\n\n473\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.700\nThings like your fingerprint recognition\nsystems, voice recognition systems,\n\n474\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.850\nhand geometry scanners,\nif you will, retinal patterns,\n\n475\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.310\niris scanners, all some kind of\nphysical characteristic of yourself.\n\n476\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.590\nThat is biometric.\n\n477\n00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:30.850\n&gt;&gt; It's funny Hollywood makes it like\nthere's another one of those little\n\n478\n00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.940\ncategories there, it's something I\nhave that is something you are, right?\n\n479\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.780\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n480\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.063\n&gt;&gt; Hand scanner.,\nwell you don't need the hand.\n\n481\n00:24:38.063 --> 00:24:39.295\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nYeah that's right.\n\n482\n00:24:39.295 --> 00:24:40.375\n&gt;&gt; It probably always does that.\n\n483\n00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:41.825\n&gt;&gt; Yes I want my eyes back.\n\n484\n00:24:41.825 --> 00:24:43.235\nWhy?\nBecause they're mine.\n\n485\n00:24:43.235 --> 00:24:45.140\n&gt;&gt; I got to get into this locked box here.\n\n486\n00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n487\n00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:48.225\n&gt;&gt; I can't just have you open\nit through threat of pain.\n\n488\n00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:52.575\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so on the exam\nremember multi-factor authentication is\n\n489\n00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:55.385\nmore than one of those\nauthentication factors.\n\n490\n00:24:55.385 --> 00:24:57.105\nSo if I say username and\n\n491\n00:24:57.105 --> 00:25:01.090\npassword, that isn't multi-factor\nbecause that's two things you know.\n\n492\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.990\nDon't let that trick you out.\n\n493\n00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.470\nBut if I say you have to have\na username and password and\n\n494\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.740\nyou have to have a key fob\nthat hits this electron door.\n\n495\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.930\nNow you have multi factor authentication.\n\n496\n00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.530\nIf I say you have a key fob and\n\n497\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:17.000\na finger print scanner, now you have\nmore than one authentication factor.\n\n498\n00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.650\nIt becomes multi-factor authentication.\n\n499\n00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.025\nThe other thing that we wanna\nimplement are things like directory\n\n500\n00:25:22.025 --> 00:25:23.510\npermissions, all right?\n\n501\n00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.620\nAnd this goes, directory permissions are\nusually coupled with user authentication.\n\n502\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.960\nAnd the fact that when we\nsay directory permissions,\n\n503\n00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.910\nI just want you think about\nyour basic NTFS permissions and\n\n504\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.860\nshared permissions that are on\nyour local machines, right?\n\n505\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.770\nI have an ACL,\n\n506\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.540\nan Access Control List, that defines what\nlevel of access somebody has to a file.\n\n507\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.250\nWell, guess what?\n\n508\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.530\nInside of your corporate environments,\n\n509\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.750\nwhere you're dealing with a domain\nenvironment where there's a directory.\n\n510\n00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.300\nYou just implement permissions.\n\n511\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.264\nI say, okay,\nDan's part of the administrative group.\n\n512\n00:25:49.264 --> 00:25:50.460\nGuess what?\n\n513\n00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.820\nHe gets full control access\nto the network documentation.\n\n514\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.110\nWes is a standard user.\n\n515\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.730\nGuess what?\nYou\n\n516\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.090\ndon't even get to read the documentation.\n\n517\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.280\nSo basically, directory permissions\ndefine what level of access you have\n\n518\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.290\nover the resources that\nare contained within that directory,\n\n519\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.950\nwithin that database, if you will.\n\n520\n00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.880\nAll right, others things too.\n\n521\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.375\nImplementing things like\nVPN communications.\n\n522\n00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:15.950\nVPNs, remember virtual private networks.\n\n523\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.560\nVPN communications are the way we\nimplement something known as tunneling.\n\n524\n00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.010\nAll right, and this is the way we can\ntake a public infrastructure something,\n\n525\n00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.240\na network infrastructure that's\nowned by somebody else and\n\n526\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.640\nwe can create this virtualized point\nto point connection across it.\n\n527\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.180\nAnd then we encrypt the communication\nbetween those endpoints, essentially\n\n528\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:40.370\nscrambling that data within that tunnel\nproviding an extra level of protection.\n\n529\n00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.410\nWe also wanna worry about things\nlike data loss prevention, DLP.\n\n530\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.820\nIt's got a couple of different acronyms,\ndata leak protection and\n\n531\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.160\ndata loss protection, all right?\n\n532\n00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.070\nData loss protection could be the fact\nthat you're implementing a RAID 1\n\n533\n00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.390\nconfiguration so that if a hard\ndrive fails, you have access to it.\n\n534\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.080\nYou have back ups,\nthat's data loss prevention.\n\n535\n00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.910\nData leak prevention is making sure that\nyou have user authentication, making sure\n\n536\n00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.390\nthat you physically secured documents so\nit doesn't end up in the wrong hands.\n\n537\n00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.210\nImplementing social media policies that\nmakes sure that your users aren't using\n\n538\n00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:17.530\nthings like social media and leaking data\nout to people that they shouldn't be.\n\n539\n00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.870\nDisabling ports, right?\n\n540\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.850\nWe talked about ports as basically a\nlogical end point of a connection, right?\n\n541\n00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.870\nIf I'm gonna be using something like SMTP,\n\n542\n00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:31.980\nthen that means on my computer,\nport 25 is open.\n\n543\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.590\nWell, guess what?\n\n544\n00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:37.120\nIf I'm not using SMTP and\nI'm using IMAP which is port 143,\n\n545\n00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.560\nthere's no reason to have\nport 25 open on my computer.\n\n546\n00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.250\nDisable the port, right.\n\n547\n00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.460\nEssentially what you do is\nyou disable the service and\n\n548\n00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.910\nit disables the port that's\nassociated with the service.\n\n549\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.450\nWe had mentioned access control lists,\nsmart card, email filtering.\n\n550\n00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.570\nAll right, that's a big one because if you\nthink about email filtering in general,\n\n551\n00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.850\nyou wanna have some kind of email policies\nthat makes sure that only the people\n\n552\n00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.510\nthat you expect to be emailing\nyou into your company\n\n553\n00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.970\nare the ones that are emailing you and you\nhave spam protection as well, all right.\n\n554\n00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.990\nTrusted and untrusted software.\n\n555\n00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.440\nWhen we talk about trusted and untrusted\nsoftware, you have things built into like\n\n556\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.482\nfor instance, Windows,\ncalled the smart screen filter.\n\n557\n00:28:14.482 --> 00:28:17.310\nAll right, you have the user account\ncontrol and what happens there?\n\n558\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:22.200\nThe next thing that I'm gonna talk about\nis across all operating systems and\n\n559\n00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.990\ndigital signatures that\nare applied to software.\n\n560\n00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.160\nWhat does a digital signature do?\n\n561\n00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.077\nWell, a digital signature just means that\nI can verify who the publisher is of that\n\n562\n00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:32.799\nsoftware.\n\n563\n00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:35.918\nAnd then, I can take that digital\nsignature and use an operation on\n\n564\n00:28:35.918 --> 00:28:39.960\nthe software itself, to make sure that\nit hasn't been modified in any way.\n\n565\n00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.723\nYou have things inside, like for instance,\nSmartScreen Filter inside of Windows,\n\n566\n00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:48.374\nthat looks at the data within\nthe meta data within that software.\n\n567\n00:28:48.374 --> 00:28:52.310\nIt says, hey let me reach out to\nMicrosoft, they maintain something known\n\n568\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.871\nas a reputation database and\nfind out do I recognize the publisher or\n\n569\n00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:58.640\ndoes smart screen filter\nrecognize the publisher.\n\n570\n00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.820\nAnd if it does, you might not even\nbe aware that anything happened.\n\n571\n00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.020\nThe user account control just makes sure\nthat you are aware that something's gonna\n\n572\n00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.360\ndownload to your computer and\nmake a modification to your registry.\n\n573\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.040\nBut it is a known,\ntrusted installation source.\n\n574\n00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.100\nAnd all you gotta do, well if you're\nan administrator, is continue.\n\n575\n00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.580\nHowever, there are times when it says,\nI don't know who this is.\n\n576\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.843\nAnd if it doesn't who is it,\nyou better trust the source, right,\n\n577\n00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:25.525\nbecause I've seen that before where just\nbecause Windows doesn't recognize doesn't\n\n578\n00:29:25.525 --> 00:29:29.205\nmean it's a malicious species software, it\njust means maybe the company going through\n\n579\n00:29:29.205 --> 00:29:32.470\nan update process and\nupdating the software's digital signature.\n\n580\n00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.420\nAnd it hasn't made it to the database.\n\n581\n00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.030\nSo, trusted known installation\nsources is important, right.\n\n582\n00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.530\nAll right, user education,\nwe kind of talked about that already.\n\n583\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.760\nRemember, any kind of security\nimplementation or preventative method\n\n584\n00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.280\nmeans that the first thing that has to\nhappen is your users have to be aware as\n\n585\n00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.240\nwhy they don't click on emails coming\nfrom people that they're not aware of.\n\n586\n00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.610\nOr downloading or installing that\npiece of software that they have\n\n587\n00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.680\nno clue where it came from, right?\n\n588\n00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.590\nEducation is the first line of defense,\nall right.\n\n589\n00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.240\nLast but not least, we have, I know\nwe're running short on time here, Dan.\n\n590\n00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.090\nLast but not least,\n\n591\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:11.820\nI wanna talk about anti malware and\nanti-virus as well as firewalls.\n\n592\n00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.100\nAll right, so what does a firewall do?\n\n593\n00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.026\nWell, we got firewalls, we've talked about\npretty extensively in other episodes, but\n\n594\n00:30:18.026 --> 00:30:20.519\nwe'll go ahead and\nreal quickly we'll include it here.\n\n595\n00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:24.732\nRemember that it protects information\ncoming into your computer, into your\n\n596\n00:30:24.732 --> 00:30:28.895\nnetwork, and going out of your computer or\nout of your network, all right?\n\n597\n00:30:28.895 --> 00:30:29.920\nNow, what am I talking about?\n\n598\n00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.815\nWhen I talk about coming into your\nnetwork, I mean you have what are known as\n\n599\n00:30:32.815 --> 00:30:37.060\nnetwork-based firewalls and they control\ntraffic going to any computer, inbound or\n\n600\n00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.640\noutbound in your network,\nthe entirety of your network.\n\n601\n00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.960\nYou also have what are known as host-based\n\n602\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.842\nfirewalls like the Windows firewall,\nright?\n\n603\n00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.965\nLike iptables inside of Linux if you will,\n\n604\n00:30:45.965 --> 00:30:50.300\n*nix based systems that controls\nthe traffic that's going in and\n\n605\n00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.560\nout of the operating system itself on the\nhost, hence the term host-based firewall.\n\n606\n00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.870\nBut then you also have anti-malware,\nanti-virus software.\n\n607\n00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.640\nAnd there are two different kinds as well.\n\n608\n00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.750\nAnd like firewalls,\nthe same thing applies.\n\n609\n00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:07.190\nYou have what's known as a host-based\nanti-malware, anti-virus software.\n\n610\n00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:12.880\nAnd that's like Windows Defender\nthat just runs on the one machine,\n\n611\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.790\njust on the Windows operating\nsystem that it's protecting.\n\n612\n00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.547\nBut you also have network\nbased anti-virus and\n\n613\n00:31:18.547 --> 00:31:22.280\nanti-malware solutions that run in things\nlike your next generation firewalls that\n\n614\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.040\nare screening all of the traffic coming\nin, and out of your network, all right?\n\n615\n00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.070\nSo a few different things that you\nhave to be aware of on the exam.\n\n616\n00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.480\nLet me just look back, it looks like, the\nlast thing I think I didn't mention here\n\n617\n00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.300\nin preventative methods,\nis when it comes to physical documents,\n\n618\n00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.820\none of the other ways that you can\nsecure it, is through proper disposal.\n\n619\n00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.950\nRight, making sure that people,\nyou just throw it in the dumpster, right?\n\n620\n00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.390\nWe have a social engineering tactic\ncalled dumpster diving when people try to\n\n621\n00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.770\nactually gain your\ninformation by diving in\n\n622\n00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:58.210\nthe dumpster and pulling that information\nout, and being able to read it.\n\n623\n00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.860\nAll right, you have companies that will\nhave protected bins that will come on site\n\n624\n00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.820\nto your company and\nthey will shred the documents, so much so\n\n625\n00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.690\nthat you can't rebuild the information.\n\n626\n00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.040\nSo that is another part of physical\nsecurity that I wanted to include there.\n\n627\n00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.400\nAnd last but not least,\n\n628\n00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.552\nwe talked about a security guard being\none of the first lines of defense.\n\n629\n00:32:17.552 --> 00:32:19.600\nGuess what the security\nguard should always have?\n\n630\n00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.200\nAn entry roster, an entry control roster.\n\n631\n00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.850\nIt says, are you on the list?\n\n632\n00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.440\nOkay, you're allowed in.\n\n633\n00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.430\nYou're not on the list?\n\n634\n00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.240\nOkay well,\nare you allowed a visitor's pass?\n\n635\n00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.290\nMaybe but either way it's documented.\n\n636\n00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:36.230\nKnowing who is coming in and out of\nyour building physically can help to\n\n637\n00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.480\nreally stop a lot of these\nattacks before they happen.\n\n638\n00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.220\nSo quite a few different\ncommon prevention methods.\n\n639\n00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.940\nJust make sure that you are implementing\na layered defense system and\n\n640\n00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.470\nit always starts with user awareness.\n\n641\n00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.060\nAll right Wes, it's a really good\nprimer on computer security.\n\n642\n00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.520\nReally, it's what it boiled down to.\n\n643\n00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.489\nAt the end of the day, these are the\ncommon things that you need to be aware of\n\n644\n00:32:57.489 --> 00:33:01.285\nwhen it comes to just standard,\nstraight forward computer security.\n\n645\n00:33:01.285 --> 00:33:04.030\nWe wanna make sure that you guys\nare up to stuff when it comes to that.\n\n646\n00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:08.378\nWes, is there anything else that we\nneeded to cover before we close the show?\n\n647\n00:33:08.378 --> 00:33:12.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is one thing I forgot\nin user awareness as an acceptable use\n\n648\n00:33:12.287 --> 00:33:14.120\npolicy, an AUP, they call out.\n\n649\n00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.100\nSo just real quickly, remember that\nif you're using wireless networks or\n\n650\n00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.630\nyou're using computer software,\nor you're using the computers.\n\n651\n00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.920\nKiosks within your networks and stuff.\n\n652\n00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.630\nA lot of times you might\nhave what's called an AUP.\n\n653\n00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.470\nThat's just an acceptable use policy.\n\n654\n00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:33.050\nIt defines the proper use of\nany information system and\n\n655\n00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.760\nthe intellectual or information or\nphysical property of a company.\n\n656\n00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.860\nOne last one I wanted to throw\n\n657\n00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.816\nin [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem Wes.\n\n658\n00:33:39.816 --> 00:33:40.474\nDo you thank you for that.\n\n659\n00:33:40.474 --> 00:33:42.100\nAnd thank you for stopping by.\n\n660\n00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.600\nWe thank our audience for watching as\nwell, hopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n661\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.740\nAnd signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n662\n00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n663\n00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.035\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time!\n\n664\n00:33:51.035 --> 00:33:56.816\n[MUSIC]\n\n665\n00:33:56.816 --> 00:33:59.952\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

Bay [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:08.417\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:09.960\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.060\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.170\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, well, we're continuing on\n\n8\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.450\nwith more in our A+ series, 220-902 for\nthose of you keeping score.\n\n9\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.240\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain, lending his expertise to us so\n\n10\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.130\nthat we might learn from him,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.060\nWes, welcome back man.\n\n12\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.570\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.350\nGreat to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.310\nGreat to move into more\nof that 902 series, and\n\n16\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.010\nwe've been really just\nfocusing on security, right?\n\n17\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.940\nIn the last couple of\nepisodes that we've done,\n\n18\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.710\nwe're in domain 3.0 and\nwe're talking about security.\n\n19\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.410\nAnd in this one we're gonna talk about\nmore of the windows security settings and\n\n20\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.600\nthere are a few different kinds\nthat they call out on the exam.\n\n21\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.140\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwe'll dive right in.\n\n22\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.910\nIf you're following along out there\nwith us, we are in 3.3 here, compare and\n\n23\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.130\ncontrast the differences of basic\nWindows OS security settings.\n\n24\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.031\nAnd one of the first things that they\ncall out are users and groups, all right?\n\n25\n00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:13.859\nUsers and groups really are your first\nline of defense when it comes to\n\n26\n00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.428\nmaintaining the stability and\nuptime of the operating system.\n\n27\n00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:18.345\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n28\n00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.586\nWell, back in the days of XP,\n\n29\n00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:25.699\nwe're gonna go way back in time\nhere back to the early 2000's,\n\n30\n00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:30.560\nI think it was 2001-ish when\nXP was first released, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.510\nThere was a user model that would really\n\n32\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.300\nallow just about anybody to do whatever\nthey wanted on their computers.\n\n33\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.870\nAnd what I mean by that more specifically\nis the fact that when you install\n\n34\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.850\nthe operating system and\nyou configure the first user,\n\n35\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.050\nthe first user would be what's known\nas the default Windows administrator.\n\n36\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.490\nAnd here's the thing about that, the\nWindows administrator, kind of like in our\n\n37\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.760\nnext space systems, Unix and Linux,\nwhere we have what's known as a root user.\n\n38\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.860\nIt is the most powerful\naccount on the machine.\n\n39\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.690\nAnd when we say, powerful account,\nI'm talking about privileges.\n\n40\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.736\nPrivileges essentially in the Windows\nworld are these system configurations\n\n41\n00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:11.866\nthat can happen, configuration\nof the registry, if you will,\n\n42\n00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:16.544\ncore security settings, core\nfunctionality in the operating system.\n\n43\n00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:18.754\nWell, here's the problem, all right?\n\n44\n00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:23.626\nAfter the research was done,\nthey determined that most end users can\n\n45\n00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:26.986\ndo just about every bit\nof their day to day work,\n\n46\n00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:31.220\nnever needing that level of privilege,\nokay?\n\n47\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.540\nNow here's the other thing\nthat's a problem with that.\n\n48\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.290\nWhen you run as one of those\nadministrative users, any software that\n\n49\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.650\nyou have is also gonna run in the context\nof the administrator, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.380\nAnd again, what I mean by that is the\nprivileged access to core functionality\n\n51\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.000\nwithin the operating system being able\nto make modifications to the registry.\n\n52\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.590\nAnd the registry is very, very important\nto understand what's going on there,\n\n53\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.680\nthat's configuration database.\n\n54\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.310\nIt contains all\nthe configurations of Windows.\n\n55\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.910\nAnd the problem is,\nwhen you start modifying the registry,\n\n56\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.130\nyou change the functionality of\nthe operating system for better or worse.\n\n57\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.110\nAnd when applications do that and\nyou're unaware of it,\n\n58\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.108\nthis is where viruses get in, right?\n\n59\n00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:14.759\nAnd they start causing functionality\nproblems, let alone things like driver\n\n60\n00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:19.351\ninstallations, which should be just\na part of normal routine maintenance.\n\n61\n00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:22.470\nI don't know routinance is,\nbut routine maintenance.\n\n62\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.166\nAnd in the days of XP, a standard user,\nyour everyday user that didn't know\n\n63\n00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:33.602\nanything about drivers, could make\nthese changes for better or worse.\n\n64\n00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:36.249\nAnd also when they would\ndownload applications,\n\n65\n00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.851\nthese applications would take\nadvantage of those privileges too.\n\n66\n00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.594\nSo when Vista came out,\nwhen Windows Vista came out,\n\n67\n00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:47.890\nthey completely changed\nthe user architecture.\n\n68\n00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.620\nAnd what they did is they introduced\nsomething known as the SUA, standard user\n\n69\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.020\narchitecture, in which you had standard\nusers and you had administrative users.\n\n70\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.300\nNow understand you've also always\nhad kind of a standard user and\n\n71\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.950\nyou've had an administrative user, right?\n\n72\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.110\nBut in the earlier days in XP and prior,\n\n73\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.690\nwhat we have was we would\nhave guest accounts.\n\n74\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.106\nAnd we'd have administrative accounts.\n\n75\n00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:13.076\nAnd the problem is too many administrative\naccounts were running when they didn't\n\n76\n00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:14.214\nneed to be, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:18.607\nSo understand that users and groups\nare basically going to be, should be,\n\n78\n00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:21.257\nclassified based on\nthe level of privilege or\n\n79\n00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:24.280\naccess they need to a machine\nwith Windows system.\n\n80\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.081\nLet me show you what I mean here,\n\n81\n00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.960\nwe've got a few different types of users\nor groups, if you will, all right?\n\n82\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.310\nThe reason I say users or\n\n83\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.190\ngroups is because users are grouped\ntogether based on that privilege.\n\n84\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.050\nBut I can also say an administrator\nis part of the administrator's group.\n\n85\n00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.900\nNow administrator, again,\n\n86\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.980\nis the most privileged account\nwithin a Windows operating system.\n\n87\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.700\nNot only can they make changes to\nthe functionality core configuration of\n\n88\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.529\nthe operating system, they can also modify\nthings like your security settings.\n\n89\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.930\nYou also have what are known as standard\naccounts, standard users, all right?\n\n90\n00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.800\nSometimes just classified\ninside of Windows as users.\n\n91\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.431\nAnd with the users or standard user\naccounts, they have limited access.\n\n92\n00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.077\nThey can perform most of their day\nto day functionality, but again,\n\n93\n00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:09.058\nthey can't make those changes to\nthe core functionality operating system.\n\n94\n00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:13.249\nLike for instance, installing drivers or\ninstalling applications that make\n\n95\n00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.850\nmodifications of the registry or\nrun administrative utilities, all right?\n\n96\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.394\nThat's your standard user or\nstandard user accounts.\n\n97\n00:05:21.394 --> 00:05:22.973\nNow in those earlier days,\n\n98\n00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:27.506\nif you needed to give somebody some level\nof administrative functionality but\n\n99\n00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:31.764\nyou didn't want them really to have\naccess to every bit of administrative\n\n100\n00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:35.559\nfunctionality, you could create\nwhat are known as power users.\n\n101\n00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:40.362\nAnd a power user could perform\nsome administrative functions, but\n\n102\n00:05:40.362 --> 00:05:44.920\nthey really couldn't perform\nall administrative functions.\n\n103\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.980\nNow they are in there today.\n\n104\n00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.190\nYou will still find power users inside\nof your Windows operating systems, but\n\n105\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.050\nI have to tell you you're only going to\nfind them for backwards compatibility,\n\n106\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.300\nthey're not used today and\nI'll show you that here in a second.\n\n107\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.980\nNow you also have a guest user.\n\n108\n00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.440\nAnd guest users and the default\nadministrator, today in Windows and\n\n109\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.330\nsince Vista, since that standard user\nsecurity architecture came out with\n\n110\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.820\nthe user account control triggering and\nstuff, guest users and\n\n111\n00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.850\nthe default administrator\nare disabled by default.\n\n112\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.402\nWhy?\n\n113\n00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:18.024\nWell, guest users,\n\n114\n00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:23.621\nyou can limit a standard user just by\ngiving them a standard user account.\n\n115\n00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:26.210\nAnd guests,\nyou don't want them to have access, right?\n\n116\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft always made me\nscratch my head on this one.\n\n117\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.660\nThey keep the guest user account,\nthey have it disabled by default.\n\n118\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.330\nThat's good, right?\n\n119\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.730\nIf I have the wherewithal to\nget into the local users and\n\n120\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.360\ngroups area of the management console,\nthe computer management console, and\n\n121\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.530\ncreate a new user if I wanted to or\nenable or disable this.\n\n122\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.010\nWhy even have it around any more?\n\n123\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.020\nWhy not just remove it completely?\n\n124\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.580\nAnd if I need to have a guest come in, I\ncan create a guest account when necessary.\n\n125\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.910\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question because if you\nlook at documentation and stuff, and\n\n126\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.850\nyou find out, well,\nhow do you limit the guest account?\n\n127\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.730\nWell, first of all it's disabled.\n\n128\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.070\nBut if you do actually enable it,\n\n129\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.370\nit's limited by the permission\nsets that you give them.\n\n130\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.820\nAnd it's like saying, okay, I'm gonna\ncreate an account that has no access.\n\n131\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.680\nAnd I just give it the exact level of\naccess I need or a standard user can still\n\n132\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.530\nperform functionalities\nwithin the operating system.\n\n133\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.030\nI honestly don't know unless\nwhy honestly you would use it.\n\n134\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.457\nBut again, maybe debate for another day or\n\n135\n00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:32.308\nmaybe we can get somebody from\nMicrosoft to let us know exactly why.\n\n136\n00:07:32.308 --> 00:07:36.537\nBecause we get maybe inside of\na decentralized environment,\n\n137\n00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:40.615\nyou might want to use a guest\naccount where you have a kiosk.\n\n138\n00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:43.288\nWhere you don't have that corporate\nenvironment where its centrally\n\n139\n00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:44.065\nmanaged and stuff.\n\n140\n00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:46.890\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; Is the guest account any different than\n\n141\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.300\na standard user account?\n\n142\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's the difference.\n\n143\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.911\n&gt;&gt; It's more restrictive.\n\n144\n00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:53.163\n&gt;&gt; More restrictive.\n&gt;&gt; So the standard user account has\n\n145\n00:07:53.163 --> 00:07:55.889\na certain level of access to the machine,\nand\n\n146\n00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.717\na certain level of access you\nhave to different applications.\n\n147\n00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:03.962\nThink about taking all of that out and\nthen really just fine tuning the level of\n\n148\n00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:06.480\naccess [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] makes sense.\n\n149\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, and again, [LAUGH] I tell you, I\ndon't really use the guest account at all.\n\n150\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.945\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you any time I've\never enabled a guest account.\n\n151\n00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:13.715\n&gt;&gt; That's the same thing.\n\n152\n00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:14.245\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n153\n00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:15.235\n&gt;&gt; I haven't either.\n\n154\n00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:19.215\nAnd power users are really just backwards\ncompatible with things like XP-based\n\n155\n00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:19.875\nsoftware.\n\n156\n00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:21.685\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And in fact you'll see that inside\n\n157\n00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:22.895\nof local users and groups.\n\n158\n00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:26.165\nAnd in fact let me go ahead and\nswitch on over here.\n\n159\n00:08:26.165 --> 00:08:28.115\nI'm in a Windows machine right here.\n\n160\n00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:34.000\nSo let me go ahead and I'll right-click on\nour start tile there or our Windows tile.\n\n161\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.620\nWe get down into local users and\ngroups and we'll go into groups and\n\n162\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.030\nwe'll look at some of\nthese default groups.\n\n163\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.410\nSo they'll actually show you,\nright, you have complete and\n\n164\n00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.570\nunrestricted access to the computer or\nthe domain our administrative users.\n\n165\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.610\nIf you guys and gals out there can\nalways check out these other ones here.\n\n166\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.670\nBut guests, right,\nhave the same access as users, you'll see,\n\n167\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.870\nexcept for the guest account,\nwhich is further restricted and\n\n168\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.709\nyou can define the level\nof access they have, right?\n\n169\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.170\nPower users notice it just says for\nbackwards compatibility and\n\n170\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.920\npossess limited administrative powers,\nagain this is about privileges and\n\n171\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.440\nit's really just backwards\ncompatibility because\n\n172\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.685\nhonestly I haven't used the power user\ngroup at all since the days of XP.\n\n173\n00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:28.935\nAgain, but it is there and\nyou might want to be aware of it, right?\n\n174\n00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:32.185\nUsers that, now on the exam,\nthey call out standard users.\n\n175\n00:09:32.185 --> 00:09:36.945\nUnderstand that pretty much everybody\nis a standard user today and\n\n176\n00:09:36.945 --> 00:09:40.125\nnotice it says prevented\nfrom making accidental or\n\n177\n00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:44.520\nintentional system-wide changes, but\nthey can perform most of their day to day\n\n178\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.690\noperations right, run most the day to\nday applications and that's what I mean.\n\n179\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.340\nYou can do most of your day to\nday work without ever needing\n\n180\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.380\nthose administrative level privileges.\n\n181\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.180\nSo those are a few\ndifferent types of users.\n\n182\n00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.830\nNow I put one extra one in here because\nit isn't called out on the exam, but\n\n183\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.520\nI want you to be aware of it just for\nyour own benefit Dan and\n\n184\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.130\nI have stressed throughout these series\nthat sometimes we gonna give you exactly,\n\n185\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:14.410\nwell, we always gonna give you some of\nthe objectives that you need to know for\n\n186\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.825\nthe exam, but sometimes we're gonna give\nyou stuff too that's a little extra.\n\n187\n00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:21.745\nAnd it's just for your own benefit I want\nto just mention briefly system accounts\n\n188\n00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:24.455\nbecause you do have two different kinds of\nsystem accounts on your machines that I\n\n189\n00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:25.285\nwant you to be aware of.\n\n190\n00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:28.835\nAnd you can actually find this when you\nlook in things like permissions so for\n\n191\n00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:32.335\ninstance, if I let me just take\nthis folder here I was working with\n\n192\n00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:37.550\na diagnostic and recovery toolkit,\nthere are times that the system\n\n193\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.630\nneeds to perform functionalities\nthat happen in the background.\n\n194\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.540\nAnd here's where you can\nsee the system account.\n\n195\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.610\nNotice that the system account,\n\n196\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.850\nit's a user, if you will, but\nit's not an interactive account, right?\n\n197\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.498\nNow what I mean by that is we're not\nlogging in as the system account, right?\n\n198\n00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:58.920\nAnd you can see that it's\ngot unrestricted access to\n\n199\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.330\nbasically to the entire system,\nit is the system.\n\n200\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.120\nThere's also another one here that that\nyou need to be aware of sometimes too and\n\n201\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.620\nthat's called network.\n\n202\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.270\nNetwork is another one of those accounts\nand that's what controls the network\n\n203\n00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.540\ncommunications in the background so\nit's another privileged account and\n\n204\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.950\nthat's why I wanted you to be\naware of it of that it is there,\n\n205\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.860\nit isn't called out on the exam but\njust know that it's there.\n\n206\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.180\nAnd I say this because we're\nin the context security right,\n\n207\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.980\nif these accounts are ever jeopardized or\n\n208\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.440\nmaliciously acquiesced I guess you would\nsay you know I'm if so many takes control\n\n209\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.870\nover him they have unrestricted access\njust like an administrative account and\n\n210\n00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.810\neven more so the administrative account\nstill triggers the user account control.\n\n211\n00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:44.310\nGuess what?\n\n212\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.250\nSomebody gains access\nto the system account,\n\n213\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.940\nthere's no user account control that's\ngonna be triggered on this, right?\n\n214\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.650\nThe system account controls everything\nin the background silently and a lot of\n\n215\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.710\ntime your not even gonna know it's running\nthere, but you do have to be aware of it.\n\n216\n00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.970\nNow that takes us right into our next\nsubject when we talk about NTFS,\n\n217\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.800\nthey talk about NTFS versus\nshare permissions, all right.\n\n218\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.930\nSo lets talk about what\nNTFS permissions are,\n\n219\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.380\nand in fact you can see them right here,\nright?\n\n220\n00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.260\nNotice that we have a permissions list,\nright?\n\n221\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.810\nIn other episodes we've also called\nthis in alot other operating system call\n\n222\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.130\nthese ACLs right?\n\n223\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.620\nAnd rightfully so,\nan ACL is an Access Control List It\n\n224\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.150\ncontrols the level of\naccess that a user or\n\n225\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:32.460\nas you can see groups in this case too,\nwhatever names appear in this ACL.\n\n226\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.130\nWhat level of access\nthey have on a resource?\n\n227\n00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.880\nIn this case, you can see the properties.\n\n228\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.800\nThis is a property of a directory\nthat I have on my desktop.\n\n229\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.100\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.250\nAnd you can see that there\nare different levels,\n\n231\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.870\nwell actually administrator is here and\nthe admin account by\n\n232\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.690\nthe way is an administrator account,\njust a username of admin.\n\n233\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.640\nUnderstand that we have different\ntypes of NTFS permissions.\n\n234\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.510\nWe have what's known as full control,\nmodify, read, execute,\n\n235\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.610\nlist folder contents.\n\n236\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.250\nBy the way, list folder contents\nis one that is only on folders.\n\n237\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.830\nYou do not find it on files.\n\n238\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.070\nLet me show you that fact here by\ngoing to a file instead of a folder.\n\n239\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.079\nAnd going to the security details.\n\n240\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:17.430\nAnd if we zoom into this notice that I\ndon't have that list folder access right.\n\n241\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.080\nThat's just for a directory.\n\n242\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.021\n&gt;&gt; That kinda makes sense logically.\n\n243\n00:13:21.021 --> 00:13:22.049\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n244\n00:13:22.049 --> 00:13:25.064\n&gt;&gt; How do I list folder access\nwhen there is no folder?\n\n245\n00:13:25.064 --> 00:13:29.790\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and what it does is\nit's kinda like opening a, I don't know,\n\n246\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.460\nopening a notebook if you will and\nyou You can see that there are markings in\n\n247\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.380\nthe notebook and I can read every one\nof the markings, I can read the fact\n\n248\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.830\nthat the files are there, it doesn't mean\nI can open the files themselves, right?\n\n249\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.390\nSo, I can see what's in the phonebook,\nit doesn't necessarily mean that I can\n\n250\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.120\ngain access to anybody\nthat's in the phone book.\n\n251\n00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.300\nAll right, so notice that,\nthat you do have again,\n\n252\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.230\nfull control, modify, read, execute,\nwrite and then well special permissions,\n\n253\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.290\nwe'll talk briefly about\nspecial permissions.\n\n254\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.090\nSo what does full control allow you to do?\n\n255\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.140\nYou might say well it gives you\nfull control you can do anything.\n\n256\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.950\nWell it's not as simple as that,\n\n257\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.140\nas simple as it sounds you have\nto know what it allows you to do.\n\n258\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.840\nFull control not only gives you full like\nbeing able to modify, read, execute,\n\n259\n00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.120\nwrite and everything below it.\n\n260\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.670\nIt allows you to view permissions.\n\n261\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.050\nIt allows you to take\ncontrol over the file.\n\n262\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.030\nIf I have full control over a file,\nI don't care if it's Dan's.\n\n263\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.510\nOwners, by the way, have full control\nover the files and folders they create.\n\n264\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.930\nBut if I have full control,\nI dont' have to own it.\n\n265\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.660\nI can take control over it, and\nI can give it to somebody else.\n\n266\n00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.770\nAnd that's why I said it's\nnot just as simple as saying,\n\n267\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.680\na full control means\nyou have full control.\n\n268\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.090\nYou have to know on the exam\nwhat the potential is for\n\n269\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.910\nsomebody that has full control\nover a document or a folder.\n\n270\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.580\nNow what does modify do?\n\n271\n00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.390\nModify also allows you\nto view the permissions.\n\n272\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.110\nIt allows you to make modifications,\nif you will.\n\n273\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.950\nIt allows you to override,\nmake changes to a file or folder.\n\n274\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:00.230\nDoesn't allow you to take ownership, and\nit doesn't allow you to take permissions,\n\n275\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:05.180\nor change permissions, but I will tell\nyou, I wanna compare it right away,\n\n276\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.230\nI'm gonna go down the list to Write,\nall right, write permission.\n\n277\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.270\nWrite and\nmodify sound very very similar, right,\n\n278\n00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.140\ncuz write allows you to make changes.\n\n279\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.160\nWell guess what, so does modify.\n\n280\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.220\nSo what's the difference?\n\n281\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.130\nModifying not only allows\nyou to make changes but\n\n282\n00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.960\nif you have modify it allows\nyou to also delete a file or\n\n283\n00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.230\ndelete a folder and\nthat's one big difference here, right.\n\n284\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.860\nSo let me give you an example where you\nmight use a modify from permission over\n\n285\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.640\na write permission or\nvice versa, all right.\n\n286\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.300\nLet's say Dan's the instructor.\n\n287\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.400\nAnd I'm like the teacher helper, if you\nwill, instructor's helper, all right?\n\n288\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.088\nWell Dan might wanna give me modified\npermissions because he says Wes,\n\n289\n00:15:45.088 --> 00:15:47.926\nI trust you,\nyou can delete some of the files, right?\n\n290\n00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:52.452\nOnce you tell me that you've handed me\ncopies of these files, I've graded them,\n\n291\n00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:56.143\nyou can go ahead and delete them and\nwe'll move on to the next week.\n\n292\n00:15:56.143 --> 00:15:58.438\nBut imagine somebody that's in that class.\n\n293\n00:15:58.438 --> 00:16:02.731\nThat he just wants to be able to add their\nanswers to a file that's in that folder.\n\n294\n00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:06.678\nYou don't want them to be able to\ndelete the file cuz I wanna know, well,\n\n295\n00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:09.220\nwas it my mistake that\nthe file wasn't there?\n\n296\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.240\nI don't want them to be able to have\nthe excuse, well, the file wasn't there,\n\n297\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.370\nI couldn't add my answers.\n\n298\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.590\nNo, I wanna know that you were\ndelinquent on your answers\n\n299\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.450\nbecause I didn't give you\nthe ability to delete it.\n\n300\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.580\nIt's there, it's empty,\nit's your fault, all right?\n\n301\n00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.830\nSo that might be a case where you\nwanna give somebody modified.\n\n302\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.100\nMaybe the instructor student, you want\nthem to be able to clear the folder after\n\n303\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.040\nyou've passed on a copy\nof the file to somebody.\n\n304\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.342\nBut the people that are in the class,\n\n305\n00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:38.255\nyou don't wanna be able to make any\ndeletions within that folder, all right?\n\n306\n00:16:38.255 --> 00:16:42.863\nRead and Execute is required in order\nto not only view a document, but\n\n307\n00:16:42.863 --> 00:16:46.290\nif it's an application,\nto be able to execute it.\n\n308\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.150\nThat's why the term read and execute, and\n\n309\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.760\nit does imply that you\nhave the read permission.\n\n310\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.150\nRead permission means exactly that,\nit means I can view the document.\n\n311\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.280\nI can view what's in it, but\n\n312\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.870\nI cannot make any modifications to it or\nany overwrites, changes to it.\n\n313\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.360\nNow Special Permissions, let's be careful\nwith that cuz in Special Permissions\n\n314\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.230\nthat's where you get very granular, right?\n\n315\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.500\nThese are what are known as basic NTFS\npermissions, the default NTFS permissions.\n\n316\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.070\nBut each one of these individual\npermissions are made up of\n\n317\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.730\na granular subset of permissions,\nlike for instance, Full Control.\n\n318\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.240\nI told you take ownership,\nchange permissions, right,\n\n319\n00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.610\nthere's more things that you can do\nwith Full Control than just modify,\n\n320\n00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.550\nread, execute, read and write, all right?\n\n321\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.360\nSo Microsoft says use Special Permissions\nsparingly, but if you really need to\n\n322\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.905\nfine tune things, you can get in there and\nyou can fine tune things, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:39.695\nNow let me talk a little bit about\nthis allow and deny column, right?\n\n324\n00:17:39.695 --> 00:17:42.930\n&gt;&gt; That's very interesting because\nyou look at it and you think, well,\n\n325\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.980\nif I've got allow and that's checked off,\nit means you can do it.\n\n326\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.580\nAnd then if I don't want them to have\naccess to it I would click deny.\n\n327\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.650\nBut as you'll see throughout as you\nwork through different things you\n\n328\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.290\nstart looking at these ACLs.\n\n329\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.900\nIf it's unchecked on the allow side,\nyou also don't have permissions.\n\n330\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.940\nSo that begs the question Wes, what is so\nspecial about that deny column?\n\n331\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.915\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a [LAUGH] great question,\nuse deny sparingly, right?\n\n332\n00:18:07.915 --> 00:18:09.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I want you to think of it as\n\n333\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:10.800\na dinner reservation.\n\n334\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.557\nLet's say that this ACL or this\npermissions list that we're looking at,\n\n335\n00:18:14.557 --> 00:18:17.236\nlet's say it was dinner reservations,\nall right?\n\n336\n00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:20.950\nAnd let's say the restaurant has a strict\nreservation only policy, all right?\n\n337\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.380\nWell, there's a couple of ways\nthat you can be denied access\n\n338\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.730\nto the restaurant, right?\n\n339\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.735\nIf you're on the list, allow,\nsure, come in, sit down,\n\n340\n00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:33.110\nwe got a table ready for you.\n\n341\n00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.200\nBut if you're not on the list,\n\n342\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.430\nlet's say there's no check mark,\nwell, you're not allowed access.\n\n343\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.720\nIt doesn't mean that you're\nrestricted from going in,\n\n344\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.180\nit just means that you forgot to\ncall ahead of time and gain access.\n\n345\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.810\nBut let's say you've been a customer\nbefore and you've been problematic, and\n\n346\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.150\nI see on that list that\nyou're denied access.\n\n347\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.220\nAt this point it means that I don't\ncare if you've called or not,\n\n348\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.830\nyou will not have access.\n\n349\n00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.170\nIt's the difference between what's known\nas an implicit deny and an explicit deny.\n\n350\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.707\nIn security,\nwhen we talk about an implicit deny,\n\n351\n00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:08.605\nit means you just don't have\na check mark here in the list.\n\n352\n00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:10.560\nYou just don't have a reservation.\n\n353\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.720\nBut an explicit deny means you\nare not allowed in this building,\n\n354\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.870\nyou are not allowed to view this file.\n\n355\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:21.481\nAnd you have to be very careful\nbecause an explicit, whatever it is,\n\n356\n00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:24.351\nan explicit deny trumps everything else.\n\n357\n00:19:24.351 --> 00:19:27.110\nSo you gotta be very careful with that,\nall right,\n\n358\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.577\nbecause permissions can be applied\nto users individually, and\n\n359\n00:19:30.577 --> 00:19:35.170\nthey can be applied to groups, and\na user could be in multiple groups.\n\n360\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.530\nOne of the things they say\nto manage permissions easier\n\n361\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.680\nis to create a group and\nthe level of access you need.\n\n362\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.160\nYou group your users together and\njust add the permission to the group\n\n363\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.880\nbecause what happens is when you\nassign a permission to a group, and\n\n364\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.980\nyou put a user in the group,\nit's called permission propagation, right?\n\n365\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.995\nIt propagates to everybody\nthat's within that group and\n\n366\n00:19:57.995 --> 00:20:01.823\nrather than having to manage permissions\non a user by user by user basis,\n\n367\n00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:06.066\nwhich really becomes an administrative\nnightmare, I can just create a group.\n\n368\n00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:10.120\nIf I know somebody needs read access to\na file, well, I'll just create a group.\n\n369\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.070\nMaybe I'll call it marketing_read, and\nI'll grab everybody, every user account\n\n370\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.350\nthat needs read access, drop them\nright into that group, and guess what?\n\n371\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.890\nNow it propagates to the users\nthat are within that group.\n\n372\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.840\nNow, we also have what's known\nas permission inheritance.\n\n373\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.630\nAnd permission inheritance means that,\nmaybe you have a folder, all right,\n\n374\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.050\nand inside of that folder\nyou have another folder.\n\n375\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:38.535\nAnd I assign a permission to,\nlet's say, one folder, and\n\n376\n00:20:38.535 --> 00:20:43.757\nthen when I look in here,\nI see that there's another folder in here.\n\n377\n00:20:43.757 --> 00:20:47.256\nAll right, well, permission inheritance\nmeans that, let me go ahead and\n\n378\n00:20:47.256 --> 00:20:52.110\njump in this folder real quick, all right,\nand you can kinda see our tree hierarchy.\n\n379\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:57.112\nAll right, well, permission inheritance\nmeans that if I assign a permission\n\n380\n00:20:57.112 --> 00:21:01.354\nto Users, it also inherits to Admin,\nwhich inherits to Desktop,\n\n381\n00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:05.105\nwhich inherits to DaRT8.1,\nwhich inherits to x64.\n\n382\n00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:06.210\nIt's called permission inheritance.\n\n383\n00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.157\nNow, this is a really good way that you\ncan manage your permissions as well.\n\n384\n00:21:11.157 --> 00:21:13.262\nJust like grouping your users together and\n\n385\n00:21:13.262 --> 00:21:17.069\ngiving a permission to the group\ninstead of, individually, 100 users.\n\n386\n00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:20.098\nWell, imagine if I had 100 files, and for\n\n387\n00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:23.310\n100 files I wanted to\nhave read permission.\n\n388\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:28.465\nWell, rather than going to each one of\nthose 100 files, what I do is I just\n\n389\n00:21:28.465 --> 00:21:34.443\ngive permissions, let's say here at DaRT,\nI give the read permission on that folder.\n\n390\n00:21:34.443 --> 00:21:37.636\nNow what I can do is I can\ntake all 100 files and I can\n\n391\n00:21:37.636 --> 00:21:42.590\ndrop them right into the DaRT folder and\nit inherits, right down to those files.\n\n392\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.663\nAll right, it's called permission\ninheritance, all right, and\n\n393\n00:21:46.663 --> 00:21:51.166\nit's a great way that you can control\npermissions without having to do it on\n\n394\n00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:52.470\na file by file basis.\n\n395\n00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.862\nNow, one of the ways that you\ncan see an inherited permission,\n\n396\n00:21:55.862 --> 00:21:58.300\nif I get back to,\nthis is my users and groups.\n\n397\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.533\nLet me get back to that folder there cuz,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n398\n00:22:01.533 --> 00:22:05.802\nthere's a lot of things that are being\nshown us and maybe we don't realize it,\n\n399\n00:22:05.802 --> 00:22:08.150\njust in this ACL or this permissions list.\n\n400\n00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.009\nNotice how I have this\ncheck mark right here, and\n\n401\n00:22:11.009 --> 00:22:13.392\nthese check marks are kinda light gray.\n\n402\n00:22:13.392 --> 00:22:16.011\nThat's what's known as\nan inherited permission, right,\n\n403\n00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:17.767\nwhen it's got that lighter gray color.\n\n404\n00:22:17.767 --> 00:22:20.678\nLet me see if I can show you guys,\nI tell you what,\n\n405\n00:22:20.678 --> 00:22:22.887\nwe'll bring up File Explorer here.\n\n406\n00:22:24.771 --> 00:22:28.780\nHopefully, we'll bring up a couple of\nFile Explorers and I'll go to Documents,\n\n407\n00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.940\nall right.\n\n408\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.516\nAnd what I am gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo ahead and I'm gonna create a new,\n\n409\n00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:36.830\nlet's create a new folder.\n\n410\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:44.280\nAll right, and this new folder\nI'll call Permissions Test.\n\n411\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.059\nAll right, now, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna open it up, and\n\n412\n00:22:47.059 --> 00:22:48.500\nI'm gonna look at Security.\n\n413\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.977\nNow, I haven't set a single\npermission on this Dan,\n\n414\n00:22:50.977 --> 00:22:52.582\nnotice I just created the folder.\n\n415\n00:22:52.582 --> 00:22:56.785\nBut when I right-click on it, and I go to\nthe Security tab where we have our NTFS\n\n416\n00:22:56.785 --> 00:23:00.690\npermission ACL, I notice that there\nare some gray check marks already.\n\n417\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.770\nRemember I said permission inheritance,\n\n418\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.280\nthat means right away\npermissions have applied.\n\n419\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.439\nThey have inherited or\n\n420\n00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:11.790\npropagated down to this folder without\nme having to do anything, all right?\n\n421\n00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.848\nAnd if I go ahead and\nI get into this folder, and\n\n422\n00:23:14.848 --> 00:23:18.156\nlet's say I right-click and\nI create a new file.\n\n423\n00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:26.970\nAnd I'll call this, I'll try to call it\nsomething that's English, Permission, and\n\n424\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.761\nI right-click, and I choose Properties,\nthen I go to the Security tab again.\n\n425\n00:23:31.761 --> 00:23:34.142\nWhat's going on here,\nI already have permissions and\n\n426\n00:23:34.142 --> 00:23:36.070\nI haven't set any permissions.\n\n427\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.266\nAgain, notice how it's propagating,\nit's inheriting down, and\n\n428\n00:23:40.266 --> 00:23:42.812\nI can see that these are kinda light gray.\n\n429\n00:23:42.812 --> 00:23:47.044\nWell, what's the difference between\nthat and, that's an implicit permission,\n\n430\n00:23:47.044 --> 00:23:50.442\nan inherited permission's also\ncalled implicit because I didn't\n\n431\n00:23:50.442 --> 00:23:51.470\nexplicitly set it.\n\n432\n00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.594\nLet me show you how you can\nsee the difference, all right?\n\n433\n00:23:53.594 --> 00:23:56.899\nLet's go ahead and what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna edit this ACL.\n\n434\n00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:00.116\nIn that stack what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n435\n00:24:00.116 --> 00:24:03.963\nadd I think I'll add Dan,\nwe'll add Dan to this list, all right?\n\n436\n00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:08.840\nAnd I say, you know what,\nI want Dan to have Read and\n\n437\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.302\nExecute permissions, and\nI choose OK, and I choose OK.\n\n438\n00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:20.950\nNow, if I right-click and I choose\nProperties again, and I choose Security.\n\n439\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.730\nNotice that the Admin account,\nmy account that's I'm logged into,\n\n440\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.210\nor Administrators have all\ngray check marks here.\n\n441\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.790\nAgain, these are inherited permissions.\n\n442\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.014\nBut if I go to Dan's name here in the ACL,\n\n443\n00:24:37.014 --> 00:24:42.240\nthere's a difference,\nnotice the difference in color here?\n\n444\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.849\nI've got a darker color here, that's an\nexplicit permission, and that's important.\n\n445\n00:24:47.849 --> 00:24:52.169\nAnd why is it important, because it\ndepends on what you do at this file,\n\n446\n00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:53.480\nall right?\n\n447\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.470\nAnd that's when we get into copying a file\n\n448\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:02.050\nversus moving files because that is\nsomething you have to keep in mind.\n\n449\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.760\nIf you're copying a file from\none location to another,\n\n450\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.320\nessentially what you're doing\nis you're creating a new file.\n\n451\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.010\nAnd when you create a new file,\nwhat happens is\n\n452\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.860\nit inherits the permissions of its target,\nall right.\n\n453\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.828\nAnd you also have to understand too,\n\n454\n00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:28.012\nthat moving a file can have an effect\non its permissions as well.\n\n455\n00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:31.334\nNow, let's look at that,\nall right, so let me go ahead and\n\n456\n00:25:31.334 --> 00:25:33.998\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna copy this file.\n\n457\n00:25:33.998 --> 00:25:38.699\nAnd notice that it's in the documents\nin permissions, right, but\n\n458\n00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:44.153\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna change\nthis from permission, or excuse me.\n\n459\n00:25:44.153 --> 00:25:48.064\nI'm gonna copy this, right-click and\ncopy, and I want you to keep in mind,\n\n460\n00:25:48.064 --> 00:25:50.664\nDan's permission,\nDan's name was in that list.\n\n461\n00:25:50.664 --> 00:25:53.717\nAnd, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ncopy it over to Downloads, and\n\n462\n00:25:53.717 --> 00:25:54.968\nwe'll just paste it here.\n\n463\n00:25:54.968 --> 00:25:59.514\nAnd we'll right-click, and\nwe'll choose Properties, and\n\n464\n00:25:59.514 --> 00:26:01.922\nwe'll choose the Security tab.\n\n465\n00:26:01.922 --> 00:26:03.966\nWell, wait a second,\nwhere'd Dan's name go?\n\n466\n00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:12.710\nIt's gone, why, because copying\ncreates a new file, all right?\n\n467\n00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:18.041\nAnd in copying and creating a new file,\nit inherits the permissions of its target,\n\n468\n00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:20.950\njust like I showed you,\njust like I told you.\n\n469\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:26.075\nAnd in its target location, if I was to go\nto Downloads, and in fact we'll do it from\n\n470\n00:26:26.075 --> 00:26:31.000\nthis side, and right click and choose\nProperties, and go to the Security tab.\n\n471\n00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.730\nDan isn't in the list, and\nit's inheriting its target.\n\n472\n00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.240\nNow, how about moving,\ndoes moving do the same thing?\n\n473\n00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.622\nWell, I don't know, let's find out.\n\n474\n00:26:42.622 --> 00:26:45.970\nAll right, so let's go ahead, and we'll\njust go ahead, we'll delete all of this.\n\n475\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:51.820\nAnd we'll go back to the Documents folder,\nand back to the Permissions Test location.\n\n476\n00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.845\nAnd if I right-click again and\nI choose Properties,\n\n477\n00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.379\nit should still be in the same location.\n\n478\n00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:57.730\nAnd yes, I do see inherited permissions,\n\n479\n00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:02.360\nI still see Dan's name in the list because\nI wanted Dan to have Read and Execute.\n\n480\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.810\nI got some software in here and\nhe needs to be able to execute it.\n\n481\n00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.720\nSo now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo ahead and I'll take this, and\n\n482\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.000\nI'm gonna move this file.\n\n483\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.338\nAll right, I'm gonna move it, and\n\n484\n00:27:14.338 --> 00:27:18.900\nI'm gonna move it to Downloads,\nand it's gone.\n\n485\n00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.799\nWell, let's see what happened\nto the permissions now.\n\n486\n00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.934\nI'm gonna right-click and\nI'm gonna choose Properties, and\n\n487\n00:27:22.934 --> 00:27:25.150\nI'm gonna choose the Security tab.\n\n488\n00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.320\nWait a second,\nDan's name's still on the list.\n\n489\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:35.220\nSee, I didn't create a new file here, and\nI moved it within the same NTF volume.\n\n490\n00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.336\nAnd because of that,\nit inherits the permissions of its target,\n\n491\n00:27:40.336 --> 00:27:45.088\njust like it did before, but\nI want you to notice something.\n\n492\n00:27:45.088 --> 00:27:50.043\nExplicit permissions, and\nthis is why I'm taking the time to tell\n\n493\n00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:54.556\nyou the difference between an implicit,\nit's inherited,\n\n494\n00:27:54.556 --> 00:27:59.175\nI didn't set it, it was already set for\nme, it's implicit.\n\n495\n00:27:59.175 --> 00:28:02.742\nAn explicit setting is\ngoing to be retained\n\n496\n00:28:02.742 --> 00:28:07.870\nwhen you're moving within\nthe same NTFS volume.\n\n497\n00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.630\nSo because I moved this file,\n\n498\n00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.010\naccording to the master file table,\nit hasn't changed locations.\n\n499\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.210\nThe pointers move for visualization\nin the graphical user interface, but\n\n500\n00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.000\nunder the subsystem within the NTFS\npermissions, it hasn't changed anything.\n\n501\n00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.050\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I can hear you in my mind,\ngoing, exam alert, exam alert.\n\n502\n00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.515\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, sir.\n&gt;&gt; This can definitely be\n\n503\n00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:28.922\na great question that they'll\nprobably throw at you on the exam.\n\n504\n00:28:28.922 --> 00:28:32.583\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, now let me also\nshow you, now that we've got a good,\n\n505\n00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:35.828\ncalm pond of understanding,\nlet me throw a rock in it, right?\n\n506\n00:28:35.828 --> 00:28:38.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there is one thing that would\n\n507\n00:28:38.452 --> 00:28:39.620\nhappen.\n\n508\n00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.250\nLet me go ahead,\n\n509\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.390\nI'm gonna do a Ctrl+Windows key+ Z,\nand you'll, my god, what happened?\n\n510\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.707\nWell, I just, actually, moved it back\nto the original location, right, so\n\n511\n00:28:47.707 --> 00:28:48.778\nI undid my changes here.\n\n512\n00:28:48.778 --> 00:28:52.514\nAnd if I look at Properties, go back\nto the Security tab, notice I still\n\n513\n00:28:52.514 --> 00:28:57.140\nhave those original inherited permissions,\nand I have Dan's explicit permissions.\n\n514\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.400\nI just moved it back to where it was.\n\n515\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.430\nHere is one I do not want you\nto get wrong, notice I have,\n\n516\n00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.150\nwe're in Local Disk C, by the way, let me\nmake mention of that, we're in one volume.\n\n517\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:12.110\nWhat happens if you move it across\nNTFS volumes, well, let's find out.\n\n518\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:16.362\nNotice I have another hard drive in here,\nand it's called Local Disk Z, all right?\n\n519\n00:29:16.362 --> 00:29:22.560\nAnd that's from our file history episodes\nwhere we were using file history.\n\n520\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.160\nLet me go back to Permissions Test and\nI'm gonna do a drag and drop here.\n\n521\n00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.800\nAnd I'm gonna drag this down to\nLocal Disk Z, and drop it there,\n\n522\n00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.620\nall right, and\nit's showing up, it's there.\n\n523\n00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.150\nNotice when I move,\n\n524\n00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.910\nthough, notice what happened,\nit's still in the original location.\n\n525\n00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.185\nSo what happened when I\nmoved it to Local Disk Z?\n\n526\n00:29:43.185 --> 00:29:44.590\nI don't know, let's find out.\n\n527\n00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.270\nLet's right-click on the Permissions file,\nlet's choose Properties,\n\n528\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:54.240\nlet's look at the Security tab, well,\nsure enough, Dan's name is gone again.\n\n529\n00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.100\nWhen you move across NTFS volumes,\nyou've essentially created a new file,\n\n530\n00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.078\nand it inherits the target\nvolume's permissions.\n\n531\n00:30:04.078 --> 00:30:07.215\nSo you want an easy way to remember\nthis one, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n532\n00:30:07.215 --> 00:30:09.649\ncuz I've given you four\ndifferent scenarios here?\n\n533\n00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:13.808\nEasiest way to remember it, the only time\nit retains permissions is with explicit\n\n534\n00:30:13.808 --> 00:30:16.135\npermissions moved within that same volume.\n\n535\n00:30:16.135 --> 00:30:21.300\nThat's all I want you to remember,\nall other scenarios on the exam,\n\n536\n00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.890\nit's where you send it\nthat it's gonna inherit.\n\n537\n00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.882\nNow, Dan, I know there's a lot more that\nwe have to get to cuz we haven't even\n\n538\n00:30:26.882 --> 00:30:30.036\ntalked about shared permissions, but\nI know what I have done, and talked a lot.\n\n539\n00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:31.108\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n540\n00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:35.427\nyou definitely had a lot to say because\nthis is a very difficult concept if you\n\n541\n00:30:35.427 --> 00:30:40.219\ndon't grasp it like Wes was trying to, and\nmasterfully so with letting you know that\n\n542\n00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:44.160\nthere's only really one derivation\nfrom inheriting permissions.\n\n543\n00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.550\nAnd that's if you move within-side\nthe same volume, right?\n\n544\n00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.690\nIf you remember that one simple fact,\n\n545\n00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.090\nyou should be able to get any\nof those questions correct.\n\n546\n00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.440\nSo make sure you drill\nthat into the brain.\n\n547\n00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.296\nBut it is just a bit of breadth for us to\ngo through, so it does take up some time.\n\n548\n00:30:57.296 --> 00:31:00.919\nBut that's okay, we'll move into\na part two to get the rest of it.\n\n549\n00:31:00.919 --> 00:31:02.745\nWes, we do appreciate your time and\neffort on this.\n\n550\n00:31:02.745 --> 00:31:03.271\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n551\n00:31:03.271 --> 00:31:06.703\nAnd we do thank you, good audience member\nout there for watching, but it is time for\n\n552\n00:31:06.703 --> 00:31:07.449\nus to sign-off.\n\n553\n00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:09.939\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n554\n00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:10.923\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n555\n00:31:10.923 --> 00:31:12.370\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n556\n00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:19.810\n[MUSIC]\n\n557\n00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.376\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:07.967\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.269\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.198\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:16.292\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:19.540\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well, guess what?\n\n8\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.790\nIt's more in our A+ Series, and\nyou kind of figured that was coming,\n\n9\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.950\nyou didn't have to be a psychic\nto figure that out, right?\n\n10\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.683\nYou hit the button, you know you're in A+,\n\n11\n00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:28.652\nwe just wanna verify that\nyou're actually there.\n\n12\n00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:31.848\n[LAUGH] Joining us back in the studio\nto help continue in that endeavor,\n\n13\n00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.320\nour good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.200\nWes, welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.090\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\n\n16\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.820\nlooking to continue on in our part\ntwo of the Windows Security Settings.\n\n17\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.610\nAnd in the first part\nwe were talking about,\n\n18\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.560\nwell, really about permission, right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.190\nWe're talking about NTFS permissions and\nwe're showing you a little bit of what\n\n20\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.650\nhappens when you copy files,\nand when you move files.\n\n21\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.430\nKeep in mind that, it will change\nthe way the permissions are applied\n\n22\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.060\nto your different resources like files and\nfolders.\n\n23\n00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.789\nNow, we also gotta talk about some\nadditional permissions as well.\n\n24\n00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.722\nSo let's go ahead and what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna dive in and\n\n25\n00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:06.530\nreally continue right where we left off.\n\n26\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.410\nAnd we're gonna talk about what\nare known as share permissions.\n\n27\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.800\nNow you might have seen in earlier\nepisodes we've actually been using one of\n\n28\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.180\nour servers to share resources out.\n\n29\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.831\nAnd we've kind of shown you\nguys how to browse to them.\n\n30\n00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:24.222\nRemember, that's through the Universal\nNaming Convention, the UNC path,\n\n31\n00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:29.520\nbackslash, backslash, computer name,\nbackslash, whatever the share name is.\n\n32\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.430\nWell, we also have to keep in mind that\nwe can control access to those shared\n\n33\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.450\nresources as well.\n\n34\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.545\nAnd as administrators you really should\ncontrol access to just about any resource,\n\n35\n00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:40.274\nwhether it is local on the machine or\n\n36\n00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:43.637\nwhether you're going across\nthe network and you're accessing it.\n\n37\n00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:46.660\nNow, what do I mean when I say local?\n\n38\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.390\nWell, when I say local,\nI mean quite literally you're sitting at\n\n39\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.440\nthe Windows computer where that device,\nor where that resource is.\n\n40\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.610\nYou log into the local machine, and\nit is on the local hard drive, right?\n\n41\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.730\nThat's where NTFS permissions apply.\n\n42\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.138\nBut we also have to understand that when\nyou connect over the network as well.\n\n43\n00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:08.540\nAnd you connect to, let's say, that\nserver, where we've got our network share.\n\n44\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.130\nThat NTFS permissions\nalso apply there too.\n\n45\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.420\nBut then when you stack on that again on\ntop of it some additional permissions,\n\n46\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.980\nand those are known as share permissions.\n\n47\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.180\nLet's go ahead, and\nwe're going to dive right in here.\n\n48\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.710\nLet's go to our Windows server\nhere where we've got this share.\n\n49\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.054\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna do some modifications to, well,\n\n50\n00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:31.521\nthe file that I shared out, or the folder,\nI should say that I've shared out.\n\n51\n00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:34.098\nRemember that you share folders.\n\n52\n00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:37.669\nThe only way the share a file is to\nfirst create a shared folder and\n\n53\n00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.400\nthen to put that file in there.\n\n54\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.118\nThere's no way to share\nfiles individually.\n\n55\n00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:46.217\nAll right, so we're gonna go head and\nwe're gonna dive into local disk C here.\n\n56\n00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:47.986\nAnd we're gonna look at the ACL and\n\n57\n00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:52.014\nwe'll just right click if I say ACL\nremember that's your permissions list and\n\n58\n00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:55.571\nwe find that from the security tab\nwhen you right click on the folder.\n\n59\n00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:59.330\nAnd we choose Properties and\nthen Security.\n\n60\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.938\nAnd if we dive right in here,\nI'll tell you what I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:03.100\nI'm gonna add Dan to this ACL.\n\n62\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.872\nI'm gonna add Dan to the permissions\nlist here real quick.\n\n63\n00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:07.221\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n64\n00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:08.449\nlet's give him access, right?\n\n65\n00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.927\nAnd even more so-\n&gt;&gt; I'm totally deleting all these files.\n\n66\n00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:14.891\n&gt;&gt; That's right there gone [LAUGH]\ndon't put any of your mp3s up\n\n67\n00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:15.830\nthere\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n68\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.763\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna delete them all.\n\n69\n00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:17.574\n&gt;&gt; That's a huge collection for me.\n\n70\n00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:19.102\n&gt;&gt; Right so we'll go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:22.829\nwhat we're going to do is we'll\nadd Dan to that permissions list.\n\n72\n00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.744\nAnd we'll find his name in\nthe directory and we'll go ahead and\n\n73\n00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:27.727\ndo a check names here and\nthere he is right.\n\n74\n00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:31.060\nAnd notice that he's now on the list.\n\n75\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.942\nNow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go\nahead and I'm gonna give Dan full control.\n\n76\n00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:35.631\n&gt;&gt; Your second mistake [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:38.580\n&gt;&gt; I know exactly, because he told\nme he's gonna delete everything.\n\n78\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.369\nWhy don't I just give him full\ncontrol let him mess everything up?\n\n79\n00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.209\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose OK to that.\n\n80\n00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.596\nAnd now he has full control.\n\n81\n00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:51.060\nNow, let's go ahead and let's move over to\nour other machine that we've been using.\n\n82\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.656\nIn this case, I'm just going to\nuse our Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n83\n00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:56.624\nKeep in mind that this would\nbe the same thing in Vista,\n\n84\n00:03:56.624 --> 00:04:00.700\nif you happen to be using it, or\nWindows 8, or Windows 7 for that matter.\n\n85\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.120\nAnd we'll go ahead, and\nwe'll login as Dan.\n\n86\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.769\nThat'll be dlowrie,\nI believe is how I set up his username.\n\n87\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.532\nAnd we'll log in.\n\n88\n00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:11.020\nYep, there we go.\n\n89\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.400\nAll right, kinda funny I can login\nbetter as Dan than I can myself here.\n\n90\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.810\nWe'll go ahead,\nwe're gonna browse to that network share.\n\n91\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.850\nNow remember,\nI gave him full control, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.130\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll open up our file explorer here.\n\n93\n00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.650\nRemember our UNC path,\nremember how we got to that?\n\n94\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.220\nI told you it was // whatever\nthe computer name is / the share name.\n\n95\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.870\nAnd in this case you can see the UNC path.\n\n96\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.528\nSo understand what's going on\nhere ladies and gentlemen.\n\n97\n00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.550\nUnderstand that we're connecting across\nthe network from our Windows 8.1 machine\n\n98\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.550\nback to this file server.\n\n99\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.800\nAnd essentially we are connecting\nto the share, all right, now.\n\n100\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.950\nEarlier, in earlier episodes,\n\n101\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.150\nwe threw a Microsoft Remote Assistance\ninvitation in here.\n\n102\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.520\nBut I'm gonna go ahead,\nsince we gave Dan full control, and\n\n103\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.509\nwe're gonna just right-click\nhere in this folder.\n\n104\n00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.957\nAnd we're gonna create a new file.\n\n105\n00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:05.570\nAll right, so we'll just gonna\nuse our right-click options here.\n\n106\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.480\nWe'll choose New, and\nwe're gonna choose a Text Document.\n\n107\n00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.130\nWait a second here, and\nit's giving me a problem.\n\n108\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.112\nI seem to have an issue going on here and\n\n109\n00:05:15.112 --> 00:05:18.412\nyou'll notice that it says\ndestination folder access denied.\n\n110\n00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:19.520\nWell what's going on here?\n\n111\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.876\nI just gave Dan full control right why\ncan't he create a file in this folder if\n\n112\n00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:25.588\nhe has full control, right?\n\n113\n00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:29.140\nI said, hey, I want you to be able\nto just do whatever you want.\n\n114\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.010\nIn fact, he says, you know what,\nI think I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.480\nI'm gonna delete these files, all right.\n\n116\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.750\nAnd he deletes the files and\nwait a second.\n\n117\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.290\nYou need permission to perform the action.\n\n118\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.110\nWait a second here.\n\n119\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.100\nI just gave him full control.\n\n120\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.320\nWhat's going on?\n\n121\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.970\nNow, I want you to understand the\ndifference between local permissions and\n\n122\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.570\nshare permissions, okay?\n\n123\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.440\nLocal permissions are if he was to\nlog into the file server locally,\n\n124\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.460\nsitting in front of it,\nhe would have full control.\n\n125\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.480\nAnd just like Dan said,\n\n126\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.390\nhe'd be able to wreak havoc if he wanted\nto on anything that's within that folder.\n\n127\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.282\nBut when you compound share permissions,\nwhen you apply share permissions here,\n\n128\n00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.838\nyou've got another set of permissions\nthat you have to keep in mind as well,\n\n129\n00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:09.408\nall right?\n\n130\n00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:13.000\nSo let's go ahead and let's just bump\nback on over to our file server here.\n\n131\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.750\nAnd let's go ahead and look and see what's\ngoing on with the shared permissions.\n\n132\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.799\nso we're gonna do the same thing,\nwe're gonna right click on that folder.\n\n133\n00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:21.672\nAnd we're going to choose Properties,\n\n134\n00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:25.527\nbut this time instead of choosing the\nSecurity tab, you're probably, you guys,\n\n135\n00:06:25.527 --> 00:06:30.132\nyou gals are smart out there right, we're\ngoing to go to the Sharing tab this time.\n\n136\n00:06:30.132 --> 00:06:33.950\nAll right and here's where I can see\nthat network path, right the UNC path,\n\n137\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.948\nbackslash backslash computer\nname backslash share name.\n\n138\n00:06:36.948 --> 00:06:40.830\nAll right, and we're going to\nlook at the sharing permissions.\n\n139\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.380\nNow there's a couple different ways that\nyou can do sharing permissions inside of\n\n140\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.980\nWindows, right?\n\n141\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.660\nYou have what's known as the basic\nsharing interface or wizard,\n\n142\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.070\nit's not really a wizard, but if you\nwill and you also have advanced sharing.\n\n143\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.930\nLet's go ahead and look at\nthe basic sharing first, all right.\n\n144\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.980\nNow notice something,\nwhen I look at basic sharing it\n\n145\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.739\ndoes look like Dan has some\nlevel of access to this share.\n\n146\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.172\nBut we can see that\ntechnically he doesn't, right?\n\n147\n00:07:05.172 --> 00:07:08.508\nAnd let's find out why,\nlet me go to the Advanced Sharing tab.\n\n148\n00:07:08.508 --> 00:07:12.550\nAnd if we look at permissions, notice that\neven though on the surface it looks like\n\n149\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.611\nDan has some kind of permissions,\nhe has local permissions.\n\n150\n00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:21.133\nHe doesn't have any of the permissions\nthat are needed to modify,\n\n151\n00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:27.450\nmake changes to any file or\nfolder within this shared resource.\n\n152\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.440\nAnd that's something to keep in mind.\n\n153\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.288\nNotice that there's read permission.\n\n154\n00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:32.780\nIn read permission,\nhe can read the documents.\n\n155\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.400\nNotice that he could see the fact that\nthe invitation file was there, but\n\n156\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.690\nhe doesn't have change.\n\n157\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.620\nAnd change is essentially kind of\nlike an NTFS modified permission.\n\n158\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.253\nNow with share permissions, it's a little\nbit easier cuz we don't have all those\n\n159\n00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.175\nindividual permissions,\nwe only have three permission.\n\n160\n00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:51.166\nWe have full control, we have change,\nand we have read, all right.\n\n161\n00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:53.875\nSo if he's got full\ncontrol NTFS permissions,\n\n162\n00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.649\nwhy isn't he able to do\nanything to this folder or\n\n163\n00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:00.798\ncreate files within the folder when\nhe's reaching across the network?\n\n164\n00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:05.446\nAnd that's because when you combine\nshare permissions with NTFS permissions,\n\n165\n00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:09.000\nall right,\nyou get the most restrictive permission.\n\n166\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.220\nNotice that the share permission we\nhave set to everybody here says Read.\n\n167\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.610\nSo when you combine that with\nNTFS permissions of Full Control,\n\n168\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.000\nwhich one is more restrictive,\nFull Control or Read?\n\n169\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.100\nWell, guess what,\nit's the Read permission.\n\n170\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.680\nAnd that's why that is applied.\n\n171\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.390\nSo you have to understand how share\npermissions apply to NTFS permissions when\n\n172\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.510\nyou are accessing a folder or\na shared resource over the network.\n\n173\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.033\nKeep in mind that I don't care what\nside of the tracks it is, all right?\n\n174\n00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:39.011\nIf you have NTFS Read permission,\nand I turn around and\n\n175\n00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:43.170\nI give Dan Full Control share permissions,\nthe same rule applies.\n\n176\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.100\nThe most restrictive is gonna win out.\n\n177\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.422\nSo let's go ahead and let's change\nthis around a little bit, right?\n\n178\n00:08:47.422 --> 00:08:50.850\nI'm gonna give him Change permission,\nI'll give everyone Change permissions,\n\n179\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.560\nand we do this a lot.\n\n180\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.960\nAnd here's why I say, best practices,\n\n181\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.760\na lot of times it gets kinda hard to tell\nwhen you have resource access problems\n\n182\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.480\nwhat's going on,\nwhich permission's causing the conflict.\n\n183\n00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.690\nSo, a lot of times what you'll\nsee is people will give everyone\n\n184\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.220\nFull Control share permissions.\n\n185\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.053\nAnd then what they do is they restrict\nthe access level based on the NTFS\n\n186\n00:09:09.053 --> 00:09:10.025\npermissions, right?\n\n187\n00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:13.510\nCuz it doesn't matter what side of\nthe tracks is more restrictive, right?\n\n188\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.490\nWhen you access a resource\nover the network,\n\n189\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.630\na share,\nit's gonna be the most restrictive.\n\n190\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.620\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna do Change permission.\n\n191\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.931\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I would really think that\nthat would work out as well as,\n\n192\n00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:26.163\nnot only if you're accessing\nthrough share permissions.\n\n193\n00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:28.221\nBut if you are now locally\nsitting on the machine,\n\n194\n00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:30.035\nnow you have your proper NTFS permissions.\n\n195\n00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:31.980\nAnd you don't have to even\nworry about share permissions.\n\n196\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.999\nEverything's set just right at that point.\n\n197\n00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:37.138\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to troubleshooting,\nDan, that's absolutely correct,\n\n198\n00:09:37.138 --> 00:09:39.974\nbecause which side of the tracks\nis causing the problem, right?\n\n199\n00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:41.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I know which side of the tracks\n\n200\n00:09:41.742 --> 00:09:43.329\ncausing problem, right?\n\n201\n00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:45.633\n&gt;&gt; It's always the same side,\njust make it that way.\n\n202\n00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:47.693\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So keep in mind,\n\n203\n00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:50.818\nMicrosoft'll tell you actually go\nahead and peak and tweak these.\n\n204\n00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:54.629\nBut a lot of people, in the real world\nout there that are doing administrations,\n\n205\n00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:56.350\nwell, just restrict with NTFS.\n\n206\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.720\nSo let's go ahead let's\napply this setting.\n\n207\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.050\nAnd we'll choose close and\n\n208\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.570\nthe great thing about permissions\nis permissions are immediate.\n\n209\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.330\nIt's not like some of the configuration\nsettings that you apply within a corporate\n\n210\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.400\nnetwork like a GPO.\n\n211\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.980\nWhen that happens, sometimes you\nhave to log out of the machine,\n\n212\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.410\nyou have to log back into the machine.\n\n213\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.351\nNow I will say one thing that you have to\nkeep in mind if you're troubleshooting\n\n214\n00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:20.218\npermissions is that when\nthe user logs into the machine,\n\n215\n00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:22.922\nthe windows machine creates\nwhat's known as an SID.\n\n216\n00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:27.014\nA SID, it's a security identifier, and\nthat contains all the permissions that\n\n217\n00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:31.280\nare granted to the user, if you will,\nas well as the groups that they're in.\n\n218\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.210\nSo, if I made a modification to\nDan's group membership, right, and\n\n219\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.190\nthat would give him more access or more\nrestrictive access, in order for that to\n\n220\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.080\napply to his account, he'd actually\nhave to log off of the machine and\n\n221\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.460\nthen log back onto the machine.\n\n222\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.900\nSo there is a case in which\nyou might have to log off and\n\n223\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.020\nlog on to see newly applied permissions.\n\n224\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.460\nAnd that usually has to do with\na group membership change.\n\n225\n00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.720\nBecause that security identifier is\ngenerated at the time the person logs on\n\n226\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720\nto the machine itself.\n\n227\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.740\nNow if I right-click and\n\n228\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.490\nI choose New this time, notice that\nnow we got Dan's text document, right?\n\n229\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.850\nSo notice now, and\nI'll just call it Dan right here,\n\n230\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.160\nwe now have a text document that\nhe can gain access to, all right?\n\n231\n00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.410\nAnd that's because you've got to keep in\nmind, right, that share permissions and\n\n232\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.600\nNTFS permissions applied together\nis always the most restrictive.\n\n233\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.290\nSo those are a couple of things that\nyou wanna worry about, all right?\n\n234\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.640\nNow notice that Dan can\nmake modifications, right?\n\n235\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:37.490\nSo if I right-click on this document\nthat we just created, I choose Open.\n\n236\n00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.730\nAnd we'll put, this is Dan's text.\n\n237\n00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.520\nAnd we'll go ahead and save that,\nright, and if I opened it up,\n\n238\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.680\nI can add additional text here.\n\n239\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.380\nThis is more of Dan's text,\nwe're picking on Dan today, text, right?\n\n240\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:12:00.100\nSo, notice that his account can now\nmake modifications to this file, right?\n\n241\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.210\nI wanna show you something.\n\n242\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.080\nBecause now I'm gonna throw\na curve ball at you, all right?\n\n243\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.031\nWe have to talk about what are known\nas file attributes, all right?\n\n244\n00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:11.106\nWhen we look at file attributes, there are\nsome things that you have to be aware of,\n\n245\n00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:11.701\nall right?\n\n246\n00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:15.466\nI'm gonna go ahead, I tell you what,\nwhat we'll do is, so I'm not restricted,\n\n247\n00:12:15.466 --> 00:12:17.485\nI've got Dan set up as\na standard user here,\n\n248\n00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:19.800\nwhich I really should make\nhim an administrator.\n\n249\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.550\nHe's far from the standard user, but\nI'll go ahead and sign out here.\n\n250\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.750\nAnd I'm gonna log back\nin as our administrator.\n\n251\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.164\nSo let me go ahead and do that,\n\n252\n00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:31.060\nbecause there's a couple of\ncommands that I wanna show you.\n\n253\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.276\nAnd I don't want any\nadministrative privileges or\n\n254\n00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:39.555\nrights getting in the way here.\n\n255\n00:12:39.555 --> 00:12:42.317\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll log back in as the administrator.\n\n256\n00:12:42.317 --> 00:12:45.468\nAnd we're gonna fire up our,\nwell, I tell you what.\n\n257\n00:12:45.468 --> 00:12:47.298\nWe'll do this for\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n258\n00:12:47.298 --> 00:12:49.340\nWe're gonna do it from\nthe command prompt as well.\n\n259\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.535\nSo you have inside of Windows, you have\nwhat are known as file attributes.\n\n260\n00:12:53.535 --> 00:12:58.200\nAnd let me go ahead and\ncreate a document here.\n\n261\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.130\nI'll just call it A plus.\n\n262\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.530\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on it and\nI'm gonna choose Properties.\n\n263\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.850\nNow let me go ahead and\nkinda zoom in here and show you.\n\n264\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.195\nNotice these attributes\nthat are down here?\n\n265\n00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:12.904\nYou have file attributes that are assigned\nto files that tell the Windows subsystem\n\n266\n00:13:12.904 --> 00:13:15.064\nwhat to do with this file, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:15.064 --> 00:13:17.139\nAnd you'll see a few here right away.\n\n268\n00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:19.212\nWe'll see Read-only, we'll see Hidden.\n\n269\n00:13:19.212 --> 00:13:22.770\nAnd if I choose Advanced,\nthere's some additional ones here too.\n\n270\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:28.349\nSo, for instance, you'll see the one that\nsays, this file is ready for archiving.\n\n271\n00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.201\nThat's actually a file attribute, as well.\n\n272\n00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:33.531\nAs well as an index attribute.\n\n273\n00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:38.123\nNow, an index attribute is one that's\nspecific to Windows that allows\n\n274\n00:13:38.123 --> 00:13:41.900\nthe Windows search subsystem\nfind this file faster.\n\n275\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.129\nHowever, keep in mind indexing,\nit can be beneficial on large drives.\n\n276\n00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.089\nHowever, if you index everything,\n\n277\n00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:51.639\nyou're not really gonna see any\nperformance benefit off of this.\n\n278\n00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:55.678\nBecause if everything is indexed, well, it\nstill means that the search functionality\n\n279\n00:13:55.678 --> 00:13:58.925\nhas to search through every\nsingle file within the drive.\n\n280\n00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:03.630\nThere are also some special attributes\nthat are assigned by the NTFS file system.\n\n281\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.895\nI know it's a little redundant there,\nand that's the compression and\n\n282\n00:14:06.895 --> 00:14:08.870\nencryption attribute.\n\n283\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.340\nCompression attribute flags it to be\ncompressed to save the on-disk size.\n\n284\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.790\nI will tell you the encryption\nattribute is interesting.\n\n285\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.850\nBecause the encryption attribute allows\nyou to use something known as EFS,\n\n286\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.690\nthe Encrypted File System.\n\n287\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.150\nAnd this allows you to scramble the\ncontents of the file, so that if Dan says,\n\n288\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.720\nhey, you know what?\n\n289\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.300\nI've got some information in here and\nI don't want anybody to be able to see it.\n\n290\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.593\nHe can go ahead and he could flag\nit with EFS, it encrypts that file.\n\n291\n00:14:31.593 --> 00:14:35.139\nAnd only the owner can actually\nview the file itself, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:39.912\nSo let's kinda show you what I mean\nhere with it telling you what the file\n\n293\n00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:43.269\nattribute tells the Window\nsubsystem what to do.\n\n294\n00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:45.787\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nIm gonna choose Hidden.\n\n295\n00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:49.461\nAnd I want you to pay attention\nwhen I choose Hidden.\n\n296\n00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:53.127\nLet me go ahead and\nmove this file down just a little bit so\n\n297\n00:14:53.127 --> 00:14:56.120\nyou guys can see that when I zoom in here.\n\n298\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.172\nI want you to notice what happens\nwhen I apply the Hidden attribute.\n\n299\n00:15:00.172 --> 00:15:01.307\n&gt;&gt; It hides.\n[LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:15:01.307 --> 00:15:03.160\n&gt;&gt; It hides, it disappears, right?\n\n301\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.900\nAnd that's because it tells File Explorer,\nin this case.\n\n302\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.380\nIf you're in Windows 7 and before,\nit would've been Windows Explorer.\n\n303\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.060\nIt says, you know what?\n\n304\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.590\nI don't want you guys to see this.\n\n305\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.790\nIt's got the hidden attribute.\n\n306\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.200\nLet's go ahead and remove it from\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n307\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.621\nNow that being said, let me go ahead and\nI'll say OK to this.\n\n308\n00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.921\nAnd what I wanna do is\nI'm gonna right-click and\n\n309\n00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:25.613\nI'm gonna choose Command Prompt.\n\n310\n00:15:25.613 --> 00:15:27.829\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose in administrative command prompt.\n\n311\n00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:30.200\nIt looks like I should've modified\nthe font here a little bit.\n\n312\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.340\nSorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n313\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.960\nLet's go ahead and\njust make that a little bit easier to see,\n\n314\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.500\nkinda hard to see out there.\n\n315\n00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.260\nAll right, and here we go.\n\n316\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.460\nAll right, so make it a little easier for\nyou all to see out there.\n\n317\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.202\nAll right, and\n\n318\n00:15:44.202 --> 00:15:47.699\nwe'll give it a little bit more real\nestate here in our command prompts.\n\n319\n00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:50.114\nNow I have to navigate to this location,\nand\n\n320\n00:15:50.114 --> 00:15:53.651\nwe're gonna use a command called attrib,\nthe attrib command.\n\n321\n00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.375\nThat's A-T-T-R-I-B.\n\n322\n00:15:55.375 --> 00:16:00.217\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's navigate to the location in which\n\n323\n00:16:00.217 --> 00:16:03.577\nwe are right now, and I'm on the desktop.\n\n324\n00:16:03.577 --> 00:16:07.556\nSo here we are on the desktop\nin the command prompt and\n\n325\n00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:13.220\nif I choose ATTRIB and I run that,\nI will see that I have two files here.\n\n326\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.100\nAll right?\nNow, both of these files are kinda hidden,\n\n327\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.590\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n328\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.300\nAll right?\n\n329\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:23.390\nYou have an easy way to\nremember the file attributes.\n\n330\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.024\nIf you can remember a little saying,\nevery file can get a rash,\n\n331\n00:16:28.024 --> 00:16:32.236\nyou can remember read only,\narchive system and hidden.\n\n332\n00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:36.771\nNow there's a couple other attributes I,\nRashy I don't know.\n\n333\n00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Rashy,\n\n334\n00:16:38.454 --> 00:16:40.956\nI is index and\nthen you also have a compression and\n\n335\n00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:44.254\nencryption attribute to,\nlike I said the encryption attribute\n\n336\n00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:48.480\nwrites to the NTFS file system to encrypt\nwith EFS, to the encrypted file system.\n\n337\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.361\nNow, you can also remove and\nmodify your attributes with\n\n338\n00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:58.580\nthe attrib commands, like for\ninstance I could say attrib.\n\n339\n00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.680\nOur A+, and keep in mind you have\nto spell out the full name here.\n\n340\n00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:09.140\nI have to do the .txt, and\nI can do a minus sign, and I can do H.\n\n341\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.400\nAll right, and when I do that,\n\n342\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.410\nwhat I should see is that that file\ncomes back to the service here.\n\n343\n00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:23.740\nNow, I wanna also show you one scenario\nin which attributes trump permissions.\n\n344\n00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.020\nAll right, so if I right-click on\nthe File here, and I look at Properties,\n\n345\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.890\nand I look at the security tab.\n\n346\n00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.770\nNotice that the Administrator.\n\n347\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.760\nI am the administrator, and\nit lets me have full control, and\n\n348\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.310\nthis is my file so I'm the creator,\ncreator-owner has full control.\n\n349\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:42.570\nBut also notice that the administrators\nthemselves, they also have full control.\n\n350\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:48.940\nThat means that I should be able to\ncome in here and put Text, right?\n\n351\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.500\nAnd I should be able to Save it and\nwe'll go ahead close, or once it's saved,\n\n352\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.940\nclose it down.\n\n353\n00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.720\nAnd there's my text.\n\n354\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.180\nMy text is in the document itself.\n\n355\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.650\nNow, if I take the attrib command or\n\n356\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.000\nwe could do this for the graphical user\ninterface with the little check box, but\n\n357\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.100\nI don't know which one they might\nask you on the exam, so know both.\n\n358\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:13.960\nI could do an attrib and then I can do\na +R to the, let me name the file first.\n\n359\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.400\nA+ .txt here, and then a +R.\n\n360\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.600\nLet's see what kinda happens here.\n\n361\n00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.180\nIn fact let me go ahead and\nrun the attrib command.\n\n362\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.830\nAnd if you run it by itself, attrib.\n\n363\n00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.560\nIt'll give you all the files in the\ncurrent directory tha you're located and\n\n364\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.390\nall the attributes.\n\n365\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.860\nYou can also specify this.\n\n366\n00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:38.380\nSo I can put a full path to the file that\nI wanna find out what the attributes are.\n\n367\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.140\nSo you understand that I'm just\nkinda doing this generically.\n\n368\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.314\nIf I was at C: here,\nI could actually put the full path and\n\n369\n00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:47.105\nit would tell me what\nthe attribute of the file is.\n\n370\n00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:50.093\nNotice that I can see archive.\n\n371\n00:18:50.093 --> 00:18:54.785\nArchive lets the Windows backup subsystem\nknow that hey, I don't have a copy of this\n\n372\n00:18:54.785 --> 00:18:58.153\nfile, and next time the backup\nruns if it sees that archive,\n\n373\n00:18:58.153 --> 00:19:02.280\nbet it's gonna say you don't have\na current copy of this file.\n\n374\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.840\nLet me go ahead and\ninclude it in your next backup.\n\n375\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.619\nWhen you run a full backup,\nit actually clears the archive bits.\n\n376\n00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:14.223\nAnd it says, it let's the backup subsets\nto know, you got a current copy of this.\n\n377\n00:19:14.223 --> 00:19:19.859\nIf you modify a file or you create a file\nsince the last time a full backup runs,\n\n378\n00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.433\nit automatically flags\nthe archive attribute.\n\n379\n00:19:23.433 --> 00:19:26.821\nSometimes called the archive bit,\nto let the backups of subsystem know hey,\n\n380\n00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:28.555\nyou don't have a current copy of this.\n\n381\n00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:31.665\nIt was either created\nsince the last backup or\n\n382\n00:19:31.665 --> 00:19:35.475\nit's been modified since the last backup,\nso you need to include it.\n\n383\n00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:36.985\nSo that's why you see the A here.\n\n384\n00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:40.535\nS is the system attribute,\nand the system attribute\n\n385\n00:19:40.535 --> 00:19:44.135\nlet's the Windows subsystem know\nthat hey that is a system file.\n\n386\n00:19:44.135 --> 00:19:46.400\nNow understand the attribute.\n\n387\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.460\nI can put on this A+.txt\nfile up here in the corner.\n\n388\n00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.350\nI can put the S attribute there.\n\n389\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.880\nAnd if I put the S attribute on it, it's\ngonna tell the Windows subsystem, hey this\n\n390\n00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.610\nis a system file, even though it's just\na text document that I just created.\n\n391\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.370\nSo again, remember these attributes.\n\n392\n00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.410\nTell the windows sub-system,\nthis is what you do with the file.\n\n393\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.390\nNow remember, I did flag the read\nonly attribute on this file.\n\n394\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.300\nAnd if I right click on this file again,\n\n395\n00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.950\nkeep in mind, I am an Administrator,\nI am the owner of this file.\n\n396\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.740\nAnd I should have full control.\n\n397\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.670\nBut now that I've got the Read Only\nattribute, let me go ahead and\n\n398\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:28.620\nI'm gonna try to modify, I'm gonna put\nmore text, oops, let's try that again.\n\n399\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.940\nMore text and I'm gonna Save it.\n\n400\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.610\nNotice what happens.\n\n401\n00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:37.240\nNotice that it says Save As, I didn't\nget the automatically just saving it.\n\n402\n00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.390\nAnd if I say okay, I wanna save it as txt,\n\n403\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.270\nit's gonna ask me hey this already exists,\ndo you wanna replace it?\n\n404\n00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.470\nAnd I'll say sure, yes.\n\n405\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.010\nNotice what happens.\n\n406\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.650\nIt says that this file\nis set to read-only.\n\n407\n00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.200\nI want you to keep in mind, and this is\nan exam alert, that read-only attribute,\n\n408\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.020\nI don't care what your permissions are,\nit trumps the local permissions,\n\n409\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.330\nit also trumps the share\npermissions as well.\n\n410\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.260\nSo even though I have full control,\nthat archive\n\n411\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.870\nattribute tells the Windows backup\nsubsystem, do not let anybody modify this.\n\n412\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.330\nDon't, you're not gonna\nmake changes to it.\n\n413\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.530\nAnd that is important,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n414\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.705\nSo that's a little bit\nabout your attributes.\n\n415\n00:21:15.705 --> 00:21:17.775\nAnd it is something you wanna be aware of.\n\n416\n00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:21.045\nNow we've talked a little\nbit about files and\n\n417\n00:21:21.045 --> 00:21:24.835\nfolders, I've mentioned some of the\npermissions we've talked about permission\n\n418\n00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:29.445\npropagation they say in the first episode,\nunderstand there's also an inheritance.\n\n419\n00:21:29.445 --> 00:21:32.885\nIf I set up a permission like I\nset in the first part of this,\n\n420\n00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:37.590\nI set it on the folder level and I put a\nfile in it, it automatically propagates or\n\n421\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.123\ninherits down to sub folders and\nfiles within that folder.\n\n422\n00:21:41.123 --> 00:21:45.083\nBut I also want you to know, they call\nout on the exam whats known as, and\n\n423\n00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:47.936\nlet me not save this and\nget out of here for a second.\n\n424\n00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:52.720\nI want you to know of the system files and\nfolders.\n\n425\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.690\nThe system attribute, is one of the things\nthat lets the Windows sub system know,\n\n426\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.150\nhey you've got to protect this file.\n\n427\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.510\nWindows does a good job\nof protecting itself so\n\n428\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.290\nthat people can't make modifications\nto system files, and cause so\n\n429\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.020\nkind of irreversible damage to\nthe machine or to the operating system.\n\n430\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.070\nNow that being said just when say that,\nyou'll find plenty of\n\n431\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.580\nusers that will go click happy and they'll\nfind ways to break their operating system.\n\n432\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.530\nBut for the most part,\nWindows is trying to protect itself.\n\n433\n00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:23.060\nAnd you can usually see,\nif I get down in here into File Explorer,\n\n434\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.830\nWindows Explorer if you're in an earlier\noperating system and local disk C,\n\n435\n00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.340\nyou can see we have\na series of system files.\n\n436\n00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.662\nProgram files are exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n437\n00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:34.951\nRemember these are your\napplication folders,\n\n438\n00:22:34.951 --> 00:22:38.574\nthe x86 we talked about\nthis in earlier episodes.\n\n439\n00:22:38.574 --> 00:22:41.760\nThat's your 32 bit applications and\nprogram files.\n\n440\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.120\nWithout the x86 are you\n64 bit applications?\n\n441\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.730\nBut inside of Windows, this is where our,\n\n442\n00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:53.670\nI mean where our windows files and folders\nare, I'm glad I could teach you that.\n\n443\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.600\nWhat I mean more importantly though,\nis this is where the more\n\n444\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.010\nimportant crucial files and\nfolders are for the operating system.\n\n445\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.160\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you just one location.\n\n446\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.620\nThat might come up a lot.\n\n447\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.160\nAll right, we have system and system 32.\n\n448\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.450\nAnd again, with system 32,\na lot of your important files are here.\n\n449\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.500\nYou'll see things like for\ninstance your drivers.\n\n450\n00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.060\nDrivers are very, very important.\n\n451\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.790\nAll the drivers that are built into\nthe operating system are right here.\n\n452\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.890\nSo again, keep in mind that your\nsystem files are protected.\n\n453\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:29.480\nYour operating system needs these in order\nto do its just normal functionality.\n\n454\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.683\nSo those are a couple of the things\nthat you wanna be aware of.\n\n455\n00:23:32.683 --> 00:23:34.900\nAgain, beware of system files and folders.\n\n456\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.560\nAgain, they are protected.\n\n457\n00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.400\nAnd when you do things like for\ninstance, when you run system restore.\n\n458\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.870\nSo we'll take system restore.\n\n459\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.690\nIf I'm gonna make a modification,\nor install a drive,\n\n460\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.950\nor I'm gonna install an application.\n\n461\n00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.710\nWhat ends up happening is,\n\n462\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.930\nyour system restore takes that point in\ntime snapshot of your files and folders.\n\n463\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.410\nAnd what's going on there\nis it's essentially,\n\n464\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.560\nbasically putting all of your system\nfiles in a read only copy and\n\n465\n00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.360\nit's putting them to the side, so\nthat if you make modifications or\n\n466\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.280\nchanges you can restore them\nto that earlier point in time.\n\n467\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.170\nSo again keep in mind that system\nfiles are very, very important.\n\n468\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.770\nNow, Dan, I do have a few additional\nkind of things that we gotta have to\n\n469\n00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.940\ntake a look at but looks like I\nkind of run the gamut on this one.\n\n470\n00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.660\nWe might have to put\na comma in this episode.\n\n471\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what?\n\n472\n00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.450\nThere's no problem with that.\n\n473\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.430\nWe're more than happy to\naccommodate my good friend, Wes.\n\n474\n00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.020\nWe do thank you for dropping by today and\ngetting us this far.\n\n475\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.420\nLooking forward to that part three.\n\n476\n00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.710\nSo join us there.\n\n477\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.380\nDefinitely check that out to run down\nwhat we can do inside of Windows,\n\n478\n00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.790\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n479\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.350\nOf being so, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n480\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.570\nFor ITPRO.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n481\n00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.350\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n482\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.385\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n483\n00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:49.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n484\n00:24:49.227 --> 00:24:52.194\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:06.433\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.428\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:12.215\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:13.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.180\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.290\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode, well, we are moving on,\n\n9\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.830\nmoving forward with more in our A+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.600\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nagain to help us finish that job and\n\n11\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.510\nget A+ certified,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.520\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.280\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.240\nThat's right, well,\nI talked a lot in that last episode.\n\n16\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.330\nIf you've joined us,\nyou know that already.\n\n17\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.130\nBut we did have just a few things that\nwe wanted to kinda round off, and\n\n18\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.440\nwe didn't want to try to basically\nfit it all into a single episode.\n\n19\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.620\nSo you might find out that this episode's\ngonna be a little bit shorter, but\n\n20\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.210\nthere's a couple of these topics\nthat we wanna talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.520\nWe wanna really, really dive into and\n\n22\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.970\nactually show you because well,\none of the topics is BitLocker and\n\n23\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.750\nin other episodes we kind of\nmentioned what BitLocker was.\n\n24\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.130\nIt's a drive encryption technology but\nwhen it comes to the features,\n\n25\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.078\nthat's really all we did.\n\n26\n00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.420\nWe just kinda told you a little bit\nabout it and we really wanna dive in and\n\n27\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.180\nshow you it.\n\n28\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.272\nWe also talked about, and I think the\nsecond part of Windows security settings\n\n29\n00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:13.761\nhere, we talked about\nsomething known as EFS.\n\n30\n00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:18.420\nAnd I mentioned that it's an extended\nattribute of the NTFS file system.\n\n31\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840\nWell, I wanna go ahead and\nI wanna take it a little bit further and\n\n32\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.900\nshow you how you would implement EFS if\nyou had a file that you needed to encrypt.\n\n33\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.020\nSo let's go ahead,\nthat's where we're gonna start here.\n\n34\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.550\nNow with EFS, the encrypted file system,\n\n35\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.917\nthat was one of the benefits that came\nalong when we moved into NTFS stage.\n\n36\n00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.675\nNow NTFS, understand, ladies and\ngentlemen, it's been around for\n\n37\n00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:39.384\na very long time.\n\n38\n00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:44.280\nIt's not something that is just a spring\nchicken here, it's definitely matured.\n\n39\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.140\nIn fact, I think we're around 50,\n5.0 or something.\n\n40\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.392\nI always remember that cuz I\nremember the old mustangs, right?\n\n41\n00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:50.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:51.184\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n43\n00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:55.088\nSo we're around NTFS version 5.0.\n\n44\n00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:56.654\nSo again it's been around for\na little bit.\n\n45\n00:01:56.654 --> 00:02:00.710\nBut one of the things to keep in mind\nthat was really unique about NTFS in\n\n46\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.720\nthe Windows world was, well,\nprior to that we were using FAT32, and\n\n47\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.820\nFAT32 lacks security settings, right?\n\n48\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.264\nWe couldn't set things like permissions.\n\n49\n00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:12.750\nNow Unix systems,\nyou all that are in the Unix Linux world,\n\n50\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.173\nyou all know that Unix systems,\n\n51\n00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:20.498\nPosix has had ACLs ever since the Unix\nsystem started way back in 69.\n\n52\n00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:24.150\nSo this isn't something that\nis specific just to Windows.\n\n53\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.180\nIt just wasn't included in\nWindows until we moved into NTFS.\n\n54\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.772\nThe fact that we could set permissions,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.279\nWe could control the level of access\nthat somebody has to a resource,\n\n56\n00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.860\nbut then it also brought in the ability\nto scramble that information.\n\n57\n00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.494\nAnd what we mean is when we say\nencryption, understand what we're talking\n\n58\n00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:43.470\nabout is taking plain text, running it\nthrough a cipher, right, an algorithm,\n\n59\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.414\na mathematical operation that the output\nbecomes what's known as ciphertext.\n\n60\n00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:51.444\nAnd if cyphertext has done its job,\nif encryption has done its job,\n\n61\n00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:56.480\nit means that only the authorized parties\nhave access to that information, right?\n\n62\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.464\nIn security, we talk about\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n63\n00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:00.247\navailability.\n\n64\n00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:02.800\nYou might hear it called the CIA triad,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.477\nConfidentiality is handled\nthrough encryption.\n\n66\n00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.336\nIt means,\nlet's say let's take EFS out of it, right?\n\n67\n00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:10.450\nAnd I've got confidential information.\n\n68\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.034\nI wanna make sure that only Dan has access\nto things like personal identifiable\n\n69\n00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:17.415\ninformation which is what we can have\ninside of our directories, right?\n\n70\n00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:20.193\nIt's one of the reasons we say setting\ndirectory permissions because you\n\n71\n00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:23.350\ndon't want just anybody having access\nto personally identifiable information.\n\n72\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.510\nSo if I wanna make sure that\nonly Dan has access to it,\n\n73\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.670\nthere's a couple things I can do.\n\n74\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.990\nFirst of all, make sure that he's got\nthe permissions over the directory itself,\n\n75\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.480\nbut then1 we can also take files that\nmaybe contain that information and\n\n76\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.690\nI can encrypt it and just make\nsure that the security encryption\n\n77\n00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.890\nis something that only he can view.\n\n78\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.940\nNow it stays confidential, right?\n\n79\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.322\nIntegrity is something that we deal with\nby making sure that the data maintains its\n\n80\n00:03:46.322 --> 00:03:47.665\noriginal form, right?\n\n81\n00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:49.127\nIt's not modified in any way.\n\n82\n00:03:49.127 --> 00:03:51.733\nAnd the last bit of this is\navailability in the CIA triad,\n\n83\n00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:56.100\njust making sure that the authorized\nparties have access to that information.\n\n84\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.590\nSo let's go ahead and let's show you how\nyou would implement some kind of EFS or\n\n85\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.980\nthe encrypted files system\nthat NTFS allows us.\n\n86\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.750\nSo if I dropped down to my Windows 8.1\nmachine, keep in mind it doesn't matter\n\n87\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.910\nwhat Windows operating system\nyou're in today or on the exam.\n\n88\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.030\nThey all support EFS, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.451\nAnd we could right-click, I'm just\ngonna right-click on the desktop and\n\n90\n00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:17.530\nI'll choose New&gt;Text Document.\n\n91\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.275\nAnd this new text document, let me go\nahead and I'll name it, Secret, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:25.475\nCuz I'm just that creative.\n\n93\n00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:29.470\n[LAUGH] And we're gonna go ahead and\nI'll tell you what, we'll open it and\n\n94\n00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.640\nwe'll put some secret text in there.\n\n95\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.720\nQuite literally, secret text.\n\n96\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.310\nAll right, and\nwe wanna make sure that only\n\n97\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.140\nI have access to see what this information\nis, right, as the administrator.\n\n98\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.826\nAll right, and I'll go ahead and\nI'm gonna right-click and\n\n99\n00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.480\nI'm gonna choose Properties.\n\n100\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.525\nAnd in the properties,\nnotice on the General tab here,\n\n101\n00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:53.310\nright, it gives us a little bit\nof information about the file.\n\n102\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.170\nNotice this Advanced button, right,\nwe've talked about in the last episode.\n\n103\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.593\nWe talked about the Attributes, right?\n\n104\n00:04:57.593 --> 00:05:00.435\nI said Read-only,\narchive system, Hidden index and\n\n105\n00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:02.489\nthen some of the extended attributes.\n\n106\n00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:07.230\nWell, on the exam, they don't say\nAttributes, they just say EFS, right?\n\n107\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.623\nThey do say Attributes, but they don't\nspecifically call out encryption if you\n\n108\n00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:13.819\nwill as EFS meaning that attribute, but\n\n109\n00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.910\nyou'll set this through\nthe Advanced button, right?\n\n110\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.150\nAnd in the Advanced,\nif I choose the Advanced button,\n\n111\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.600\nnotice we've got a couple of\ndifferent attributes, right?\n\n112\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.527\nWe've got what's known as\nthe compression attribute.\n\n113\n00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:28.215\nSorry about that,\nlet me move that a little bit over there.\n\n114\n00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:32.430\nAll right, notice we have what's known\nas compress contents to save disk space.\n\n115\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.900\nThat's one of the other\nthings that NTFS brought\n\n116\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.610\nout when we moved into the NTFS days.\n\n117\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.440\nBecause in the earlier days of NTFS, disk\nspace was still generally limited, right?\n\n118\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.521\nAnd what I mean by that is that we\ndidn't have the terabyte drives\n\n119\n00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.500\nthat we have today.\n\n120\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.760\nIn fact, terabyte drives in those days\nwere just, that's mind boggling that we\n\n121\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.590\nwould eventually have drives\nthat would be that big.\n\n122\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.870\nSo this was very, very good.\n\n123\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.070\nNow today's day in age you\ndon't really need to use this.\n\n124\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.210\nI mean you still can, it's still\nan attribute of the file system, but\n\n125\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.900\nthe one that I want is the encrypt\ncontents to secure data, all right, and\n\n126\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.060\nthat is important.\n\n127\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.370\nSo if we choose Encrypt\ncontents to secure data, and\n\n128\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.230\nI choose OK, all right, and\nI'm gonna choose Apply.\n\n129\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.780\nAnd let's see if I get the little\nwarning after I choose Apply here.\n\n130\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.446\nAll right, now notice it says,\n\n131\n00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:25.440\nyou are encrypting a file that\nis in an unencrypted folder.\n\n132\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.270\nIf this file is modified, editing\nsoftware may temporarily unencrypt or\n\n133\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.590\ncopy the file, or\nunencrypt copy of the file if you will,\n\n134\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.450\nunencrypted copy of\nthe file if I can read.\n\n135\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.130\nTo ensure that the file is created\nin the parent folder are encrypted,\n\n136\n00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.970\nencrypt the parent folder too, all right?\n\n137\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.830\nNow I'm just gonna say for\n\n138\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.860\nthe purposes of this demonstration that\nwe're just gonna encrypt the file only cuz\n\n139\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.840\nI kinda wanna show you a little bit more\nabout encrypted file system, all right?\n\n140\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.330\nAnd we'll choose OK, and\nwe're gonna let this go ahead and\n\n141\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.410\nencrypt itself, all right?\n\n142\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.530\nNow, if I go ahead and I open up\nsomething like File Explorer, right?\n\n143\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.940\nAnd we look at this file from\nFile Explorer and I look at,\n\n144\n00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.820\nlet's say Desktop,\nI want you to notice something here.\n\n145\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.887\nNotice that we have,\nthe text has changed colors, right?\n\n146\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.430\nAnd that text color is letting\nme know right off the bat that,\n\n147\n00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.221\nhey, this file has been\nencrypted with EFS, right?\n\n148\n00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:23.760\nIt has the encryption attribute on it.\n\n149\n00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.426\nNow the other thing to\nkeep in mind too is that\n\n150\n00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:29.238\nthe encrypted file system will generate,\nand\n\n151\n00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:33.513\nwe talk more about this in our\nNetwork Plus and then our Security Plus.\n\n152\n00:07:33.513 --> 00:07:37.600\nWe talk about what's known as\ndigital certificates, all right?\n\n153\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.080\nIt's an encryption key\nthat's essentially created.\n\n154\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.008\nNow you have to understand with EFS,\nif I'm the owner of this file and\n\n155\n00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:45.519\nI encrypt it, all right?\n\n156\n00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:49.199\nAnd then my encryption key\ngets compromised, well,\n\n157\n00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.406\nanybody else can actually\ndecrypt this file.\n\n158\n00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:58.867\nOr if it gets corrupted,\nI could lose access to this file.\n\n159\n00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:02.350\nSo one of the things you always wanna\nremember with user accounts is if you do\n\n160\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.456\nhave encrypted files,\n\n161\n00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:07.150\nyou wanna make sure that you're\narchiving your encryption key, right?\n\n162\n00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.760\nThey call it EFS key recovery.\n\n163\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.662\nAnd that's very, very important to\nensure that you do back up that key and\n\n164\n00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:15.862\nkeep a copy of it.\n\n165\n00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:20.474\nJust in case, something happens to\nthe encryption key that stored on\n\n166\n00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:24.621\nthe machine and you need to gain\naccess to the document again.\n\n167\n00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:29.116\nIf you lose the encryption key, if it\ngets corrupted, it will lock you out of\n\n168\n00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:32.330\nthe files and that's-\n&gt;&gt; Basically wanna cry to yourself, right?\n\n169\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.100\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right and\nthat's part of the availability, right?\n\n171\n00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.710\nWhen we say the CIA triad confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability,\n\n172\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.198\nwell if the key gets corrupted it's\nno longer gonna be available to you.\n\n173\n00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:47.490\nAnd if it's got a lot of important\ninformation that maybe you've been\n\n174\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.230\nworking on, right?\n\n175\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.430\nSo important to your company, you could\nlose quite a bit of valuable time,\n\n176\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.710\nlet alone any of the information\nthat's in the document, all right?\n\n177\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.470\nSo that's a little bit about EFS.\n\n178\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.540\nAll right,\n\n179\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.580\nthe other thing they call out is user\nauthentication which is kinda interesting.\n\n180\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.020\nI tell you what,\n\n181\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.840\nI did mention at the first part of\nthis we're gonna talk about Bitlocker.\n\n182\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.400\nLet me go ahead and talk about Bitlocker\nand then we'll round it up with things\n\n183\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.639\nlike user authentication so\nwe can keep it consistent here.\n\n184\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.900\nNow in a prior episode,\none of the things that Dan and\n\n185\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.230\nI talked about, actually we had quite a\nfew features in Windows that we mentioned.\n\n186\n00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.700\nAnd one of those features was\nBitlocker drive encryption.\n\n187\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.660\nI wanna recap real quick, BitLocker.\n\n188\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.070\nBitLocker is way that you can take\nthe entire contents of your hard drive and\n\n189\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.930\nyou can kinda do what we did with\nEFS here but the difference is,\n\n190\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:39.240\nremember EFS is on a file to file basis,\nBitLocker encrypts the entire drive.\n\n191\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.990\nAll files, folders,\neverything that's on that drive.\n\n192\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.780\nAnd what it's supposed to do is protect\nyour computer from offline drive attacks.\n\n193\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:53.210\nNow, there is a very important reason\nwhy I say offline drive attacks.\n\n194\n00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.408\nAnd here's why.\n\n195\n00:09:54.408 --> 00:09:58.300\nWhat the BitLocker does is when encryption\nscrambles the drive it prevents somebody\n\n196\n00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.560\nfrom moving that drive out of\nthe machine physically and\n\n197\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.660\nmoving it to another machine and\nthen viewing that information.\n\n198\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.670\nHowever, you have to keep in mind\nthat once you unlock a drive like and\n\n199\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.220\nyou gonna see exactly how you would do\nthat I will show you that in a second.\n\n200\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.360\nOnce the drive unlocked If\nthe machine remains on,\n\n201\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.140\nthose BitLocker encryption keys, all\nright they're actually stored in RAM and\n\n202\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.740\nbecause of that you don't\nhave protection on the drive.\n\n203\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.940\nSo understand that BitLocker\nmeans when we say offline,\n\n204\n00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.500\nit means the machine is powered down.\n\n205\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.710\nIt is to protect your machine from,\nyou know,\n\n206\n00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.040\nthe data falling into the wrong hands.\n\n207\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.680\n&gt;&gt; So, if you leave your laptop or\nsomething laying, you know,\n\n208\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.230\nin a back seat of a taxi cab and you're\nlike, no and I had all those company\n\n209\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.370\nspreadsheets on there with financial\ninformation or PII or healthcare or stuff.\n\n210\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.490\nYou're like, that's really bad,\nwe're getting ready to get nailed.\n\n211\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.510\nIf you have BitLocker turned on and\ninstalled and ready to go,\n\n212\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.280\nsomeone tries to open that up.\n\n213\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.180\nAnd go, well, I can't log in,\nI don't have a login password and\n\n214\n00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.520\ncracking to might take too long.\n\n215\n00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.040\nI'll just snatch the drive out, connect\nit to another computer, enslave it and\n\n216\n00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.110\nthen, I'll read the data.\n\n217\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.392\n[SOUND] Not with BitLocker, you won't\ncuz that entire drive is now encrypted.\n\n218\n00:11:10.392 --> 00:11:12.773\n&gt;&gt; That's right and the reason, again,\n\n219\n00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:17.609\nwhen I say offline is because I've seen\nsome forms out there that people say\n\n220\n00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:21.670\nBitLocker's not, I got into that\nhard drive, it was no problem.\n\n221\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.470\nBut what they don't tell you is the fact\nthat the computer was still on and\n\n222\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.590\nsomebody unlocked the drive to begin with,\nthey typed the password in.\n\n223\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.080\nSo that's not what BitLocker is meant for.\n\n224\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.730\nNow, BitLocker has some requirements\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n225\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.410\nLike we said in our features episodes,\nwe talked about a TPM.\n\n226\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.389\nTrust platform module,\n\n227\n00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:39.866\nall it is a hardware chip that's\nbuilt into your motherboard.\n\n228\n00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:46.010\nAnd that's what BitLocker looks for\nwhen you boot the operating system.\n\n229\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.260\nWhen you start the hard drive up, that's\nhow it tells whether it's in the original\n\n230\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.320\nmachine that you enabled BitLocker on,\nor it's like Dan said,\n\n231\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.580\nit's been moved to another one because\nsomebody's trying to attack it.\n\n232\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.480\nWhen the drive initiates,\nthe drive controller's gonna look for\n\n233\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.020\nthe trusted platform module on\nthe motherboard that is associated with\n\n234\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.270\nthe BitLocker encryption, and\nthat's something to understand.\n\n235\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.940\nMany different TPMs out there.\n\n236\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.790\nWhen you initialize BitLocker and\nyou encrypt a drive with a TPM,\n\n237\n00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.170\nonly the TPM that was associated with\nthe BitLocker encryption initially\n\n238\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.760\nis gonna be the one that's going to allow\nthe drive to fully unlock, all right?\n\n239\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.580\nSo the TPM just stores digital\nBitLocker security information and\n\n240\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.910\nit is required in order to use BitLocker,\nall right?\n\n241\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:36.250\nSo that being said, it is required to\nget the full benefits of BitLocker.\n\n242\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.260\nBecause on the exam, I do want you to\nknow that if you don't have a TPM,\n\n243\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.780\nthere is a fallback method\nthat you can enable,\n\n244\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.840\nyou can enable BitLocker\nif you don't have a TPM.\n\n245\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.130\nBut again, you don't get the full\nbenefits of the offline protection.\n\n246\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.681\nAnd that's non TPM mode, all right?\n\n247\n00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:51.654\nAnd it does support that,\nlet me show you here.\n\n248\n00:12:51.654 --> 00:12:56.151\nIn fact we got the, in the Windows 8.1\nmachine that I have, they're not too hard\n\n249\n00:12:56.151 --> 00:13:00.196\nof a set up to get this started all you\nhave to do is, you just have to, you can\n\n250\n00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:04.800\ngo a couple of different ways, you can\ngo to your file explorer if you want to.\n\n251\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.490\nAnd you can right click on Local Disc C\nand you gotta make sure that you saw\n\n252\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.700\nthe right location and\nwe can turn on BitLocker this way.\n\n253\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.580\nNow keep in mind we're not really sure\nwhich way they're gonna ask you on\n\n254\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.840\nthe exams, so I wanna show you\nthe scenic approach because again\n\n255\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.260\nthat could come up on the exam.\n\n256\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.940\nSo if I right-click on my Windows tile and\nI choose Control Panel.\n\n257\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.470\nAnd if you're in Vista,\nin Windows 7, in Windows 8,\n\n258\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.510\nkeep in mind,\ncontrol panel is gonna work the same here.\n\n259\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.640\nYou're gonna go to System and Security.\n\n260\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.880\nThen you're gonna go to BitLocker Drive\nEncryption, right, here in the list.\n\n261\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.020\nAnd we could click the hyperlink or\nthe task link here.\n\n262\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.570\nBut in this case I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n263\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.470\nNow I'm going to go ahead and\nmentioned this one too while we're here.\n\n264\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.620\nNotice that we have removable data\ndrives and we have BitLocker to Go.\n\n265\n00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.490\nBitLocker to Go is really cool because,\nlike Dan was mentioning earlier right,\n\n266\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.210\nif we have a laptop and that laptop was\nleft in the back of a taxi cab [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.910\nWell what happens if you had a thumb\ndrive in the laptop's bag, right and\n\n268\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.810\nyou wanna make sure that,\nthat's encrypted, as well.\n\n269\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.780\nWell, BitLocker to Go allows\nyou the ability to take and\n\n270\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.680\nencrypt a flash drive, right?\n\n271\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.310\nSo, that's why they call it BitLocker to\nGo, it's basically removable data drives.\n\n272\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:21.670\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna turn BitLocker on, all right?\n\n273\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.490\nNow, one of the things I want you to\nkeep in mind is that this machine\n\n274\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.300\ndoesn't have a TPM.\n\n275\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.689\nAnd one of the things to keep\nin mind about the TPM is that,\n\n276\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.470\nin fact, let me go ahead and\ngo to TPM Administration down here.\n\n277\n00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.340\nNotice that it says that this\nmachine doesn't have a TPM.\n\n278\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.730\nWell if that happens, what BitLocker's\ngonna do is it actually gonna fail.\n\n279\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.380\nI kind of got this setup just so we could\nshow you what BitLocker looks like, but\n\n280\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.250\nbefore we do that,\n\n281\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.820\nlet me show you where you can go\ninto what's known as non TPM mode.\n\n282\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.680\nI've actually got it already setup for\nnon TPM mode, but\n\n283\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.750\nthis could be something\nthey ask you on the exam.\n\n284\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:04.050\nSo I'm gonna go back to the modern UI\nhere and I'm gonna type in gpedit.msc.\n\n285\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.180\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit Enter and\n\n286\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.020\nI don't really expect him to ask you\ntoo much about your group Policy.\n\n287\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:17.010\nInside of the A+, but since this is\ndirectly related to your BitLocker\n\n288\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.210\nin general, the BitLocker feature,\nthis might be one that they ask you about.\n\n289\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.440\nIn order to see the BitLocker settings,\nyou'll open your local group\n\n290\n00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.230\npolicy editor there and\nyou'll expand out Computer Configuration,\n\n291\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.140\nAdministrative Templates,\nand Windows Components.\n\n292\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.640\nAnd then what you'll see is\nthey're alphabetized here and\n\n293\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.850\nyou could see BitLocker Drive Encryption\nand there's a few different settings here.\n\n294\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.060\nFor instance, you have what\nare known as fixed data drives, and\n\n295\n00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.211\nkind of show you what\na fixed data drive is.\n\n296\n00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:49.587\nIf I was to open up file explorer here,\nnotice that I have local disk Z,\n\n297\n00:15:49.587 --> 00:15:52.345\nlocal disk Z just happens\nto be a data drive.\n\n298\n00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:56.756\nWell that's what they mean when\nthey say Fixed Data Drive.\n\n299\n00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:59.560\nNotice we have Removable Data Drives,\nthat's BitLocker To Go.\n\n300\n00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.360\nThat allows you to again,\n\n301\n00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.070\ndo a full encryption on things like\nyour removable USB flash drives.\n\n302\n00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.975\nBut the ones that we really want here\nis Operating System Drive, all right?\n\n303\n00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:14.797\nIf you don't have a TPM,\nin fact let me go ahead and\n\n304\n00:16:14.797 --> 00:16:18.260\nchange this back to it's original setting.\n\n305\n00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.010\nAnd we'll generate this error so\nyou could see what's gonna go on here.\n\n306\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:27.200\nAnd then we'll come back and\nwill show you how to enable it, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.720\nNotice that if I do decide that I want to\nturn on BitLocker by selecting local disc\n\n308\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.428\nC, in this case, and\nI'll turn on BitLocker.\n\n309\n00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:39.444\nNotice that it says, this device can't\nuse a trusted platform module, there is\n\n310\n00:16:39.444 --> 00:16:44.650\nno TPM in this device, so BitLocker\nrequires that, and that's the default.\n\n311\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.640\nLet me go ahead and\nI'll minimize this again,\n\n312\n00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.530\nsame thing would happen if we were to come\ninto the control panel with BitLocker.\n\n313\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.737\nAnd I choose turn on BitLocker while\nit would do the same exact thing,\n\n314\n00:16:53.737 --> 00:16:56.130\nand I wanna show you that just incase.\n\n315\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.570\nMaybe they happen to show that on the exam\nand they say, okay what's going on here?\n\n316\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.140\nNotice it's because the motherboard\nhere doesn't have the TPM, and\n\n317\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.220\nBitlocker requires it.\n\n318\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:12.630\nBut like it says, if you want to allow\nBitLocker without a compatible TPM,\n\n319\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:17.530\nthe option in and then it says, require\nadditional authentication at startup.\n\n320\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.590\nThis is what's known as non TPM mode so\n\n321\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.270\nyou can still do the full\ndrive encryption.\n\n322\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.330\nAnd that's where this policy setting\ncomes in that I was showing you\n\n323\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.440\nhere in the group policy editor.\n\n324\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.840\nAgain, remember it's under\nComputer Configuration,\n\n325\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.100\nAdministrative Templates, Windows\nComponents, BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n326\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.978\nAnd then Operating System Drives,\nI know it's a long path there but\n\n327\n00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:40.898\nknow it for the exam.\n\n328\n00:17:40.898 --> 00:17:43.440\nAnd the setting that they're\ntalking about here is,\n\n329\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.580\nRequire additional\nauthentication at startup.\n\n330\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.715\nAnd if we bring up that setting,\n\n331\n00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:52.758\nall we have to do is change it\nfrom Not Configured to Enabled.\n\n332\n00:17:52.758 --> 00:17:58.723\nAnd then from here,\nall we have to do is tell this setting OK.\n\n333\n00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:03.482\nAnd what happens now is, when I close\ndown the group policy editor and\n\n334\n00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:08.820\nI turn on BitLocker, you'll see\nit's checking the configuration.\n\n335\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.290\nAnd then it gives me this option\nto choose how I'm going to\n\n336\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.950\nunlock the drive at startup.\n\n337\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.480\nI could basically use a USB thumb drive\nhere if I wanted to unlock it that way.\n\n338\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.946\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm just gonna use password all right, and\n\n339\n00:18:22.946 --> 00:18:27.910\nwe'll go ahead and we'll type\nthe password here and we'll choose next.\n\n340\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.578\nAnd then it's gonna ask me,\nwhere do I wanna save this?\n\n341\n00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:34.340\nAgain I could save it to a flash drive,\ncould print it to a recovery key,\n\n342\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.490\nI'm gonna go ahead and save it to a file.\n\n343\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.019\nAll right, now the recovery key,\n\n344\n00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:42.413\nI want you to understand the recovery\nkey is important, is a 48 digit key.\n\n345\n00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:45.951\nAnd if you lose your BitLocker password,\nyou forget it if you will,\n\n346\n00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:49.135\nif the drive gets compromised,\nit goes into recovery mode.\n\n347\n00:18:49.135 --> 00:18:53.507\nAnd you're gonna have to know this 48\ndigit key in order to move that drive.\n\n348\n00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:54.448\n&gt;&gt; Just memorize it, right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:18:54.448 --> 00:18:55.805\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll show you what it\n\n350\n00:18:55.805 --> 00:18:59.805\nlooks like here and you'll see why\nDan's like, just try to memorize it.\n\n351\n00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.136\n&gt;&gt; Super easy [LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:19:01.136 --> 00:19:01.683\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n353\n00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead, and\n\n354\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.660\nwhat we'll do is we'll\nsave it on local disk C,\n\n355\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.550\nit doesn't like you trying to\nsave it within a root drive.\n\n356\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.494\nIn fact, I think this will\ngive me a hard time there,\n\n357\n00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:13.183\nnotice it says this\nlocation can't be used.\n\n358\n00:19:13.183 --> 00:19:18.765\nYour recovery key can't be saved on the\nroot directory of a non-removable drive,\n\n359\n00:19:18.765 --> 00:19:21.342\nthen it says, choose a new location.\n\n360\n00:19:21.342 --> 00:19:25.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will, [LAUGH] We'll create\na folder called BitLocker, and\n\n361\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.030\nwe'll save it in this file.\n\n362\n00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.960\nNow notice it says, do you wanna really\nsave the recovery key right here on\n\n363\n00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.410\nthe same location of\nthe drive you're encrypting?\n\n364\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.464\nNot really a good idea,\n\n365\n00:19:36.464 --> 00:19:40.067\nthis might be something you wanna save\nacross the network on a storage location.\n\n366\n00:19:40.067 --> 00:19:45.500\nOr on that external drive that maybe\nyou have on, the USB thumb drive.\n\n367\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.340\n&gt;&gt; Also, if you're in an active directory\ndomain don't forget you can store\n\n368\n00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.670\nthem there as well,\nit will fully integrate in there.\n\n369\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes definitely, and\n\n370\n00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.680\nthat's why I know that you said that\nyou've had to deal with it before too.\n\n371\n00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.440\nSo, we'll go ahead and we'll say\nyes to this, and once that's done,\n\n372\n00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.520\nwe'll choose next.\n\n373\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.950\nAnd then, this is something that is\na little bit newer with BitLocker,\n\n374\n00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:11.630\nthis isn't in Windows 7 and it wasn't\nin Windows Vista edition of BitLocker.\n\n375\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.530\nIt allows you to encrypt just\nthe used space only and again,\n\n376\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.690\nit speeds up the process, or you could\nsay, encrypt the whole, entire drive.\n\n377\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.400\nSo that's up to you, I'm gonna say,\n\n378\n00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.800\njust use the used disk space here and\nchoose Next.\n\n379\n00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.410\nAnd then it's gonna go ahead and\nrun an integrity check here, and\n\n380\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.239\nwe'll go ahead and say,\nyes and we'll click, Continue.\n\n381\n00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:39.440\nAnd notice that it's telling me that the\ncomputer must be restarted all right, and\n\n382\n00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.330\nI can see that, well, nothing's\nhappened until I restart the machine.\n\n383\n00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.990\nSo let's go ahead and what we'll do is,\nwe'll restart this machine and\n\n384\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.740\nwe're gonna let Bitlocker start\nits drive encryption, right?\n\n385\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.590\nAnd one of the things that it's gotta\ndo is it's gotta take those BitLocker\n\n386\n00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.740\nkeys and it's gotta do\na little bit of moving around.\n\n387\n00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.156\nAgain, it's also gotta remove essentially,\nthe boot file so\n\n388\n00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:03.670\nthat we can gain access to it.\n\n389\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.340\nNow notice this if you will,\nnotice what we got going on here,\n\n390\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.260\nthis is your BitLocker password that\nwe need to use to unlock the drive.\n\n391\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.630\nIf I had used the USB thumb drive\nI could just plug it in and\n\n392\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.080\nit would unlock the drive for me but\nI went ahead and I chose password.\n\n393\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.014\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose password and\n\n394\n00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:26.410\nnow that allows me the ability\nessentially, to boot into Windows.\n\n395\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.940\nNow keep in mind,\nif at any point you do not have your\n\n396\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.980\nBitLocker password,\nyou can throw it into recovery mode.\n\n397\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.060\nAnd this is where that recovery drive\nis gonna come in important for us,\n\n398\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.400\nnotice that all that allowed me to\ndo was load the operating system.\n\n399\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.230\nI still have to authenticate to the local\nWindows machine before I could log in, so\n\n400\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.070\nthat is important to remember.\n\n401\n00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.920\nOne of the last things I wanna\nshow as far as BitLocker goes,\n\n402\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.870\nis I wanna show you what\nthe recovery key is.\n\n403\n00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.510\nKind of like why Dan was joking around\nyeah, just memorize that thing,\n\n404\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.850\nbecause if we go into,\nI saved this on local disk Z in BitLocker.\n\n405\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.488\nThen if I open that recovery key keep\nin mind yeah, that's your recovery key.\n\n406\n00:22:10.488 --> 00:22:11.353\n&gt;&gt; Super easy.\n\n407\n00:22:11.353 --> 00:22:13.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly, that's a 48 digit key,\n\n408\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.330\nit isn't really too great\nto try to remember this.\n\n409\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.030\nThis is Identifier,\n\n410\n00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.530\nand this basically identifies\nthe recovery key with an instance of\n\n411\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:28.180\nthe BitLocker encryption, keep in\nmind that is not your recovery key.\n\n412\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.100\n&gt;&gt; I think that if BitLocker\ndoes go into effect and\n\n413\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.420\nyou try to boot your computer and\nit asks for the recovery key.\n\n414\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.840\nI think you will see that identifier code,\nso that the person on the other end of,\n\n415\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.400\nlet's say, your help desk person,\nyou say, can you read me your identifier?\n\n416\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.430\nMake sure that everything's up and\nup, and identifier is correct,\n\n417\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.250\nnow you know you got\nthe right recovery key.\n\n418\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:47.795\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n419\n00:22:47.795 --> 00:22:49.950\nthere was a little thought bubble\nthat come up in the background here.\n\n420\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.968\nAnd if I dive down into our notification\narea, you can see it here And\n\n421\n00:22:54.968 --> 00:22:59.476\nit's letting me know that there\nis an encryption of drive C.\n\n422\n00:22:59.476 --> 00:23:02.213\nAnd that that encryption\nis in progress there, so\n\n423\n00:23:02.213 --> 00:23:05.610\nthat's a little bit about your\nBitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n424\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.050\nOne of the last things I wanna mention\nthey talk about is user authentication,\n\n425\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.420\nthey talk about single sign-on.\n\n426\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.828\nAll right, what is an SSO,\nwhat is single sign-on as you might hear?\n\n427\n00:23:13.828 --> 00:23:16.578\nWell, single sign-on means I\nauthenticate one time, and\n\n428\n00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:19.222\nthen I don't have to keep\nentering my password, right?\n\n429\n00:23:19.222 --> 00:23:22.663\nIn a Windows domain and an active\ndirectory domain, it gives you the ability\n\n430\n00:23:22.663 --> 00:23:25.370\nto do single sign-on,\nlet me show you what I mean, right.\n\n431\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.760\nWe have that storage location\nright across the network\n\n432\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.010\nthat we've been using\nperiodically through this show.\n\n433\n00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.740\nAnd it is located on\na completely separate machine,\n\n434\n00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:43.280\nnow I authenticated, I signed onto this\nlocal Windows machine one time right.\n\n435\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.108\nNotice what happens if I go up here and\n\n436\n00:23:46.108 --> 00:23:50.592\nI browse to that shared location,\nthat shared resource.\n\n437\n00:23:50.592 --> 00:23:55.595\nNotice I got right to it and\nI didn't have to retype my password.\n\n438\n00:23:55.595 --> 00:23:57.792\nAnd that's what single sign-in is, right?\n\n439\n00:23:57.792 --> 00:24:02.340\nNow you might, out there, if you have\never used a Windows Live account,\n\n440\n00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.334\nI know it's called\na Microsoft account today.\n\n441\n00:24:05.334 --> 00:24:09.670\nIf you ever logged into Xbox Live and\nthen you can go to different locations,\n\n442\n00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.872\nif you've logged into something like\nGoogle, and you used Google Docs,\n\n443\n00:24:13.872 --> 00:24:18.010\nyou use Gmail and it doesn't\nrequire you to authenticate again.\n\n444\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.394\nThat's an example of single sign-on.\n\n445\n00:24:19.394 --> 00:24:23.424\nAnd what it does is when it comes to user\nauthentication it makes it a little bit\n\n446\n00:24:23.424 --> 00:24:25.660\nmore simplistic for the end user, right?\n\n447\n00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.800\nA little bit more convenient if you will,\n\n448\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.260\nrather than having to write down\na whole bunch of passwords,\n\n449\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.420\ncuz we really shouldn't be\nwriting them down to begin with.\n\n450\n00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.150\nBut it will happen if we\nstart to burden the user.\n\n451\n00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.009\nSo single sign-on Is a great thing.\n\n452\n00:24:39.009 --> 00:24:42.053\nAnd it's something that if\nyou have a computer joined to\n\n453\n00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:45.161\nan Active Directory domain,\nI sign on to the computer and\n\n454\n00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:49.434\nthen I can access the resources that I\nhave permissions to, [LAUGH] if you will,\n\n455\n00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:51.933\nwithout having to type\nin my password again.\n\n456\n00:24:51.933 --> 00:24:56.130\nLast but not least we've kind of talked\nabout this throughout this series as well.\n\n457\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:01.280\nNotice that there is what is known as\na Run As option, and when we say Run As,\n\n458\n00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.180\nyou can run different programs as\nan administrator or as a standard user.\n\n459\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.420\nClassic example of this is if I look\nat the Windows desktop here and\n\n460\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.170\nI right-click on my Windows tile.\n\n461\n00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.520\nRight, notice I can run this\nCommand Prompt where it says Admin here.\n\n462\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.605\nSo standard Command Prompt and\nI don't know, yeah it is running from\n\n463\n00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:25.878\nthe user profile, right, and\nit doesn't give me privileged access.\n\n464\n00:25:25.878 --> 00:25:30.131\nHowever, if I right-click on\nthe Command Prompt with Admin,\n\n465\n00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:34.810\nyou'll notice that it runs in\nthe context of the system32 folder.\n\n466\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.212\nThat directory, and\nthat does give me privileged access,\n\n467\n00:25:38.212 --> 00:25:39.777\nI can make modifications,\n\n468\n00:25:39.777 --> 00:25:44.756\nI can run things like different utilities\nthat require administrative level access.\n\n469\n00:25:44.756 --> 00:25:47.302\nSo just know the difference between\nrunning as an administrator,\n\n470\n00:25:47.302 --> 00:25:49.010\nversus running as a standard user.\n\n471\n00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.560\nKeep in mind,\n\n472\n00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.900\neven if you are an administrator, you\ntypically wanna run as a standard user.\n\n473\n00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.910\nIf you don't need the privileges,\ndon't elevate those privileges.\n\n474\n00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.680\nBecause anything that you\nrun in the background also\n\n475\n00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.600\nwill share in those privileges.\n\n476\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.170\nWhich means it could cause damage\nto your operating system whether\n\n477\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.890\nit's unintentional or maliciously in the\nbackground without you being aware of it.\n\n478\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.890\nSo keep in mind the difference between\nrunning as administrator versus\n\n479\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.250\nrunning as a standard user.\n\n480\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.300\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, well it looks\nlike we finally made it through\n\n481\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.360\nthe Windows Security settings for\nour A plus exam.\n\n482\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.900\nTake some time on this,\nit's gonna be really good information.\n\n483\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.738\nAgain, like we like to point out, there\nare times when this is all exam stuff and\n\n484\n00:26:27.738 --> 00:26:30.320\nthen there are times that\nyou're gonna use that.\n\n485\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.180\nThis stuff you're definitely gonna use.\n\n486\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.620\nSo regardless of whether\nyou're trying to study for\n\n487\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.605\nthe exam on not, this is great information\nfor you out there so take it in.\n\n488\n00:26:39.605 --> 00:26:43.310\nWes, thank you so much for walking us\nthrough all the security settings inside\n\n489\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.780\nof our Windows Operating System.\n\n490\n00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.080\nBut I'm looking at our clock and\nwe've finally run out of time for\n\n491\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.910\nour three episodes, right?\n\n492\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.253\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n493\n00:26:51.253 --> 00:26:53.403\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brian\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n494\n00:26:53.403 --> 00:27:00.867\n[MUSIC]\n\n495\n00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:03.672\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:16.720\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.990\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.070\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.440\nMoving along,\ntrying to finish that out for you guys.\n\n10\n00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.030\nSo that you can get all schooled up,\ngo pass an exam,\n\n11\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.640\nget right out there in the field there.\n\n12\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.670\nFreshly minted certs, a lot of fun.\n\n13\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.460\nJoining me back in the studio yet\nagain to lend his expertise for\n\n14\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.230\nus to help us out,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.565\nWes, how's it going today man?\n\n16\n00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:37.495\nMan It's going great.\n\n17\n00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.365\nNow I'm gonna think a minted certs.\n\n18\n00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:41.250\nIs that Peppermint or chocolate Mint?\n\n19\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or is it fresh off the press?\n\n20\n00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:44.845\n&gt;&gt; Fresh off the Press.\n\n21\n00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:45.777\nThat's right.\n[SOUND]\n\n22\n00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:46.449\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n23\n00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n24\n00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:49.855\nwe are gonna be moving\nthrough security today.\n\n25\n00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.235\nWe've actually been in a couple\nepisodes into security.\n\n26\n00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.255\nWe're gonna be focusing in on, well,\nyou probably seen the title already but\n\n27\n00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.749\nwe'll go ahead and mention it anyway,\nwork station security.\n\n28\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.860\nAnd in a past episode,\nthey talked about, we talked about,\n\n29\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.950\nI don't know who they are,\nthat would have been us.\n\n30\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That was good.\n\n31\n00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.745\n&gt;&gt; Talked about some of the concepts\nbehind securing your workstations already\n\n32\n00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.050\nand that was about passwords right?\n\n33\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.060\nWe talked about strong passwords, but\nwe'll let you guys and gals out there go\n\n34\n00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.038\npack and check out what strong\npasswords are when it comes down to it.\n\n35\n00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:26.080\nAs just a real quick recap remember,\nstrong passwords that are,\n\n36\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.470\nthat's basically passwords that are\nresilient against password based attacks.\n\n37\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.610\nAnd again, we've also talked\nabout those in other episodes.\n\n38\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.720\nSo again, we're not gonna spend\npretty much any time when it comes\n\n39\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.180\nto the DNA of a strong password.\n\n40\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.198\nNow, one of the things that you wanna\nunderstand is that they do mention that in\n\n41\n00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:45.283\nthe objectives and in fact Dan, let me go\nahead and call out the objective here.\n\n42\n00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:49.579\nThis is 3.4 given a scenario deploy and\nforce security best practices,\n\n43\n00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.090\nsecurity workstations.\n\n44\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.320\nAnd one of the very first things they\ntalk about is requiring a password.\n\n45\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.680\nSo you really shouldn't have\nany machine within your office,\n\n46\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.300\nif you will, within your corporate\nnetwork, really even within your home that\n\n47\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.580\ndoesn't require a password\nin order to get into it.\n\n48\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.260\nIn fact, I'll tell you even\nfrom a parental standpoint,\n\n49\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.300\nI require my son, he's going in, and\nsoon he's going to be in middle school.\n\n50\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.930\nAnd we require even at the basic level for\nhim to have a password for\n\n51\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.060\nhis account on my machine that we\nbasically watch over him with.\n\n52\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.760\nSo keep in mind that when it comes\nto any kind of work station.\n\n53\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.050\nAgain, from the simplest home environment\nright up to a corporate network.\n\n54\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.070\nYou wanna make sure that you at\nleast require a password to get\n\n55\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.310\ninto the workstation.\n\n56\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.840\nYou just don't wanna leave it wide open so\n\n57\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.050\nthat anybody can get into\nit any time they want.\n\n58\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.930\n&gt;&gt; Funny thing, Wes, I was looking\nover the objectives for this little\n\n59\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.350\nlovely thing we're doing here and none\nof them said don't share your password.\n\n60\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.810\nAnd to be honest with you,\nthis is a big problem.\n\n61\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.870\nPeople do that, they're like,\njust log in under my account,\n\n62\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.090\nit's easier cuz I got\neverything already set up.\n\n63\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.390\nHere's my password log in,\nwrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\n64\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.536\nI know you're trying to be nice, trying\nto make everything work really easily,\n\n65\n00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:05.866\nbut all you're doing is increasing\nyour security attack surface.\n\n66\n00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:10.486\nThat's all you're doing because now\n[INAUDIBLE] you can log into so and\n\n67\n00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:11.590\nso's machine.\n\n68\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.560\nAnd the next thing you\nknow the whole company or\n\n69\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.290\nthe whole house or\nwhoever is logging in as you.\n\n70\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.090\nAnd the whole purpose of being different,\nhaving your own account that has\n\n71\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.830\na password attached to it is so that we\ncan audit, we can keep things secure.\n\n72\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.040\nThat you have access to things that\nonly you need to have access to.\n\n73\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.600\nThat people that don't need access\nto that don't have access to it.\n\n74\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.940\nSo if you're giving it out,\nthat is a huge security flaw.\n\n75\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.990\nSo do not give out your password.\n\n76\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.720\nNo one's ever gonna ask you for\nyour password.\n\n77\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.250\nThey shouldn't be asking you for\nyour password.\n\n78\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.290\nSo just keep your password close to this.\n\n79\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.750\nThat's probably one of the biggest\nthings I've seen out in real life land.\n\n80\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.640\n&gt;&gt; And let's write a couple things down,\nunlike your password, right.\n\n81\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.670\nI want to write one thing down because\nI do wanna come back to it I'm glad you\n\n82\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.240\nkind of address that issue is\nevery password should be unique.\n\n83\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.930\nNobody should have access your password.\n\n84\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.820\nI'm gonna bookmark that,\n\n85\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.320\nwe're write that down because\nif you want to double back on.\n\n86\n00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.025\nBut I also wanna just expand\non what you were saying.\n\n87\n00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.379\nEven though it's not in the objectives\nhere Dan you've been on this journey with\n\n88\n00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.380\nme throughout 902.\n\n89\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.660\nAnd there are things that we are throwing\nin here that aren't necessarily going to\n\n90\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.580\nshow up on the exam.\n\n91\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.520\nBut you better believe that they're\ngonna show up in the real world.\n\n92\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.670\nAnd that's why we talk about in other\nepisodes, especially related to security,\n\n93\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.560\nwe talk about things like, well,\nsocial engineering, guessing.\n\n94\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.270\nGuessing is something that\nimplies a little bit of effort.\n\n95\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.390\nThere's no effort involved, right?\n\n96\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.480\nIf you write your password down, you stick\nit on the most secure place, a Post-it\n\n97\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.020\nnote, in the most secure place in\nthe world to put it, under the keyboard,\n\n98\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.800\nbelieve it or not it happens a lot, right\nthere on the side of the monitor, right?\n\n99\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.820\nThe other thing too is you may wanna keep\nin mind, we talked about insecurity,\n\n100\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.710\nas we, go through security and continually\nintroduce you to that CIA triad,\n\n101\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800\nconfidentiality, integrity and\navailability.\n\n102\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.600\nRight?\n\n103\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.420\nNow, integrity I'm gonna kind\nof skip C we'll come back to it.\n\n104\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.500\nIntegrity remember is just making sure\nthe data doesn't change, isn't altered\n\n105\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.700\nwhether intentionally unintentionally,\nmaliciously, non-maliciously.\n\n106\n00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.220\nAnd what I mean by that is that is that\nnetwork errors happen, hard drives fail,\n\n107\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.270\nthat's unintentional.\n\n108\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.670\nDoesn't necessarily have to\nbe a malicious attack, or\n\n109\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.520\nit could be some kind of attack right?\n\n110\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.190\nAvailability is making sure that\nyou have access to the resources\n\n111\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.110\nthat you're supposed to have access to.\n\n112\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.460\nBut keep in mind, you don't want to over\nshoot the runway on availability and\n\n113\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.980\nfor basically ruin confidentially\nbecause of the things we try\n\n114\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.310\nto make super convenient so\nwe don't have to remember passwords right?\n\n115\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.360\nConfidentiality is making sure that\nonly the authorized users have\n\n116\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.160\naccess to the data.\n\n117\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.778\nYou say well wait a second, Wes,\nwe're talking about workstations.\n\n118\n00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:42.050\nWhat do you think you use\nyour workstation for, right?\n\n119\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.970\nYou use your workstation as part\nof an information system to gain\n\n120\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.950\naccess to the information that you and\nyour company use, all right, so\n\n121\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.910\nit is important to\nrequire those passwords.\n\n122\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.060\nStrong passwords, like we said,\n\n123\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.680\nis making sure that they're\nresilient against password attacks.\n\n124\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.274\nNow I want to double back to\nsomething that Dan mentioned and\n\n125\n00:05:59.274 --> 00:06:02.230\nsays, everybody password should be unique\nand only you should know it, right.\n\n126\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.270\nThat's something that we actually\nemploy inside of even a corporate\n\n127\n00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.880\nenvironment, right?\n\n128\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.805\nAnd what I mean by that\nis not sharing passwords.\n\n129\n00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:11.100\nThere is one password\nsometimes that we share.\n\n130\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.520\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n131\n00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.100\nIn fact I've got a server\noperating system here and\n\n132\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.080\nI believe I have a server\noperating system here.\n\n133\n00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.105\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n134\n00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:22.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It says it's there sometimes they give\n\n135\n00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.830\nyou the screenshot and you can't tell\nwhether you're logged in or not so,\n\n136\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.840\nlooks like I am still logged in here.\n\n137\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.060\nAnd ladies and gentlemen,\nremember that we talked about in other\n\n138\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.800\nepisodes we've talked about a Windows\ndomain, we talked about network setup,\n\n139\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.510\nremember I get centralized administration\nI can manage my users from here.\n\n140\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.200\nWell as administrators,\n\n141\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.000\neven administrators shouldn't\nhave your passwords.\n\n142\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.690\nRight?\n\n143\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.600\nThat is a definite no no, right, why?\n\n144\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.400\nWell because as administrators\nyou can reset passwords.\n\n145\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.540\nIf I had a user here, let's say user and\nI got an example of one,\n\n146\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.824\nuser Student01 calls up\nthe help desk says Dan,\n\n147\n00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:58.365\nI need access to my account,\nI've lost my password.\n\n148\n00:06:58.365 --> 00:07:02.350\nDan says okay, did you file out\nyour password, reset paperwork so\n\n149\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.850\nthat we can get it authorized and\nI can go.\n\n150\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.320\nBecause you don't just\nmake changes to corporate\n\n151\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.830\nbase equipment without some\nkind of authorization.\n\n152\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.330\nLet's say that happens, right.\n\n153\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.460\nWell, notice that Dan could come in here\nand right click on that user account and\n\n154\n00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.270\nreset the password to\nsomething that he knows.\n\n155\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.920\nSo administrators don't need your\npassword because as administrators,\n\n156\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.040\nwe really want access to your account.\n\n157\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.380\nMaliciously or non-maliciously, we can\ngain access to a bunch just by resetting\n\n158\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.760\nyour password to something that we know.\n\n159\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Have had to do it actually.\n\n160\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.010\nAnd what we can do after we're done is we\njust reset the password to something that\n\n161\n00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.960\nwe can tell you and then have you\nchange it after first log in.\n\n162\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.775\n&gt;&gt; And let's go ahead an do exactly\nthat that's where I was going,\n\n163\n00:07:40.775 --> 00:07:43.865\nlooks like you have [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\nyou have been on that boat before.\n\n164\n00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:46.824\nSo let me show you exactly what he means,\nright.\n\n165\n00:07:46.824 --> 00:07:49.704\nSo of I'm gonna create,\nlet's say a new user right, and\n\n166\n00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.569\nI'm not gonna be too creative here.\n\n167\n00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:53.792\nI'm just gonna create a new user.\n\n168\n00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:56.784\nLadies and gentlemen, you don't have\nto worry about doing this on the exam.\n\n169\n00:07:56.784 --> 00:07:59.462\nI just want you to see what we're\ntalking about here, all right?\n\n170\n00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:03.542\nSo The user is gonna be student02,\noops, 92, apparently.\n\n171\n00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:04.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Student02.\n\n172\n00:08:04.894 --> 00:08:05.745\n&gt;&gt; You've got a good sized class there,\nWes.\n\n173\n00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:07.438\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we got a big class here.\n\n174\n00:08:07.438 --> 00:08:12.241\nStudent, and 02 again, so\nthat's gonna be the user's logon name,\n\n175\n00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.135\nStudent02, we're gonna choose Next.\n\n176\n00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:16.719\nNow I want you to pay attention,\n\n177\n00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:20.900\nremember Dan said we can just require them\nto change this password at the next login?\n\n178\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.367\nWell, notice here,\nuser must change password at next login.\n\n179\n00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:28.267\nSo this gives me a chance to set if\nI wanted a generic password, and\n\n180\n00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:34.250\nwe'll see if I can actually type that\npassword twice the same, same password.\n\n181\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.228\nAll right, and what I can do is that\nI can say Next, choose Finish, and\n\n182\n00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:40.124\nit looks like I did type it right.\n\n183\n00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:43.066\nAnd now what happens is when\na person logs into a machine,\n\n184\n00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:46.580\nit requires them to reset the password,\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n185\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.610\nI'm gonna pick on Dan,\n\n186\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.710\nwe've been picking on Dan's account\nthroughout this 902 series.\n\n187\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.073\nIt's been working out good,\nwhy stop a good thing?\n\n188\n00:08:53.073 --> 00:08:53.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\n\n189\n00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:54.606\nif it ain't broke, right?\n\n190\n00:08:54.606 --> 00:08:55.704\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n191\n00:08:55.704 --> 00:08:59.364\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna log into\nthe domain on a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n192\n00:08:59.364 --> 00:09:02.073\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna log in as Dan.\n\n193\n00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:06.967\nAll right, now, when I do this-\n&gt;&gt; Wes, how do you know my password?\n\n194\n00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:07.678\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Shh.\n\n195\n00:09:07.678 --> 00:09:08.716\n&gt;&gt; See, he changed it.\n\n196\n00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:09.358\n&gt;&gt; You wrote it down.\n\n197\n00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:11.719\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I did,\nput it underneath my keyboard.\n\n198\n00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:14.699\nBad idea, by the way,\nyou wanna put it on your monitor.\n\n199\n00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:16.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n200\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.341\nWe'll go ahead and what we're gonna\ndo is we'll try to sign in as Dan.\n\n201\n00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:22.886\nAll right, now it looks like I,\nthat didn't work.\n\n202\n00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:24.609\nOkay, so let me try it one more time.\n\n203\n00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:26.363\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:09:26.363 --> 00:09:27.514\n&gt;&gt; So, it looks like I didn't reset\n\n205\n00:09:27.514 --> 00:09:28.054\nthe password.\n\n206\n00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:30.615\nBut let me go ahead, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll log in as Student02.\n\n207\n00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:32.641\nWhat I was trying to do was\nsave the time that it takes for\n\n208\n00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:33.710\nWindows to build a profile.\n\n209\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.352\nBut we'll go ahead and just do this, and\nthis would really be no different than if\n\n210\n00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:40.894\nyour user was logging in for\nthe first time.\n\n211\n00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:43.778\nAgain, I was gonna try to save us\na little time on camera here, and\n\n212\n00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:45.836\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll log in, all right.\n\n213\n00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:49.868\nNow notice what the authentication screen\nis telling me, it's telling me right here\n\n214\n00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:52.614\nthat I need to change the password\nbefore I log in, right?\n\n215\n00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:55.997\nSo this gives Dan, as an administrator,\nall right, and like you said,\n\n216\n00:09:55.997 --> 00:09:57.668\nhe has done it on many of occasions.\n\n217\n00:09:57.668 --> 00:10:01.328\nThe ability to set a generic password, and\nthat generic password might be a one time\n\n218\n00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:03.945\npassword that is consistent\nthroughout the environment,\n\n219\n00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:05.846\nit might be something that changes daily.\n\n220\n00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:08.801\nToday we're going use this password for\nany on boarding employees, employees\n\n221\n00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:11.594\ncoming into your company, but then\nwe're going to change it the next day.\n\n222\n00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:16.444\nBecause one of the things, that can become\na workstation security problem as well.\n\n223\n00:10:16.444 --> 00:10:18.739\nIf they know that you're\nonboarding new employees, well,\n\n224\n00:10:18.739 --> 00:10:21.709\nI can log in as a new employee, cuz I\nalready know what the generic password is,\n\n225\n00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:23.297\nso that might be something that changes.\n\n226\n00:10:23.297 --> 00:10:26.746\nBut notice that the user has\nto change the password, right?\n\n227\n00:10:26.746 --> 00:10:31.694\nAnd I'll go ahead and I'll set,\nlet's see, what password do I want?\n\n228\n00:10:31.694 --> 00:10:37.422\nWe'll use a super ultra safe generic\npassword of, well, password.\n\n229\n00:10:37.422 --> 00:10:40.905\nAll right,\nnow we'll get a little bit more into this.\n\n230\n00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:43.139\nUnderstand that with passwords, again,\n\n231\n00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:46.129\nyou want to implement things\nlike password complexity.\n\n232\n00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:50.880\nAnd that is something that essentially you\ncan do inside of your password policies.\n\n233\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.674\nYou also want to set up things like\npassword expiration, all right?\n\n234\n00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:57.198\nNow we talked a little bit about\nthat in another episode, but\n\n235\n00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:01.564\nI do wanna kinda show you what would\nhappen if a password truly does expire.\n\n236\n00:11:01.564 --> 00:11:05.723\nSo we're gonna go ahead and what we're\ngonna do is, while this machine is getting\n\n237\n00:11:05.723 --> 00:11:09.703\nlogged in and it's building that user\nprofile, what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n238\n00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:13.464\ndo is, well, try to log in again,\nthere we go, wake the machine up here.\n\n239\n00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.048\nAnd what I got is I got\na screen saver on and\n\n240\n00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:19.024\nit's set to a blank screen\nhere in the server.\n\n241\n00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:23.916\nAll right, and what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna force these computers to\n\n242\n00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.860\nrequire a password to expire, all right?\n\n243\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.274\nAnd that'll be important for\nus, all right?\n\n244\n00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:33.301\nSo what we'll do is we'll go ahead and\nI think what we'll do is,\n\n245\n00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:36.368\nI tell you what,\nwe'll go to Group Policy here.\n\n246\n00:11:36.368 --> 00:11:41.121\nAnd you always have password policies that\nare set, within a corporate environment,\n\n247\n00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:42.891\nin something known as a domain.\n\n248\n00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:44.921\nAnd it is important to have that,\n\n249\n00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:48.121\nbecause we want to have\nthat work station security.\n\n250\n00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:49.257\nI'll go ahead and\n\n251\n00:11:49.257 --> 00:11:53.588\nwhat I am gonna do is I am gonna dive\ndown into our security policies.\n\n252\n00:11:53.588 --> 00:12:00.327\nGPOs, more appropriately named,\nexpand out Windows Settings.\n\n253\n00:12:00.327 --> 00:12:02.172\nAnd again, like I said,\nladies and gentlemen,\n\n254\n00:12:02.172 --> 00:12:03.662\nunderstand the concepts behind this.\n\n255\n00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:07.776\nYou don't have to worry about actually\nconfiguring things like your security\n\n256\n00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:10.030\nsettings inside of a domain environment.\n\n257\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.786\nWe just want to show you that when\nthey say password expiration,\n\n258\n00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:15.257\nexactly what they mean.\n\n259\n00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:19.151\nAnd we look at Local Policies, notice\nwe have Password Policies, all right?\n\n260\n00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:22.786\nNow in a domain, you can see that\nthe password age is 42 days, all right?\n\n261\n00:12:22.786 --> 00:12:27.008\nAnd what that means is in 42 days, you're\ngonna have to change your passwords,\n\n262\n00:12:27.008 --> 00:12:28.366\nit's gonna be required.\n\n263\n00:12:28.366 --> 00:12:32.622\nAll right, now I can actually force\nthis to happen if I want, right?\n\n264\n00:12:32.622 --> 00:12:37.055\nI can say, I'm gonna change the maximum\npassword age and we'll see if\n\n265\n00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:42.033\nwe can kinda fake the computer here,\njust to simulate what you guys might see.\n\n266\n00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:44.990\nAnd it's also given me some\nrecommendations, because my minimum\n\n267\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.710\npassword age is one day, too, so they\nkind of conflict, don't worry about that.\n\n268\n00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.449\nBut I do want to change this\ndown to a minimum of one day.\n\n269\n00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:58.733\nAnd let me see, also, if we can, we\ngoing to fool this machine into thinking\n\n270\n00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:04.113\nthat it's later than what it is, I'm\ngoing to change the date and time here.\n\n271\n00:13:04.113 --> 00:13:08.525\nAnd, again, you guys can kinda see how you\ncan really test this out in your own lab.\n\n272\n00:13:08.525 --> 00:13:12.061\nWe'll go ahead and\nit looks like I did change the day there,\n\n273\n00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:16.392\nI'll just double check one more time and\nmake sure that that did change.\n\n274\n00:13:19.243 --> 00:13:23.800\nAll right and yes, okay, so\nthat did change, that's what we want.\n\n275\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.618\nAll right, now this machine,\nI'm gonna also change the date and time.\n\n276\n00:13:28.618 --> 00:13:32.183\nAgain, we're just gonna kind of force\n\n277\n00:13:32.183 --> 00:13:37.044\nit here to think that it is\nafter the expiration date,\n\n278\n00:13:37.044 --> 00:13:41.601\nif you will,\nin the password policy, all right?\n\n279\n00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:44.084\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll log in and\n\n280\n00:13:44.084 --> 00:13:48.907\nauthenticate as our administrator,\nhopefully we can make this work.\n\n281\n00:13:48.907 --> 00:13:53.276\nAnd we'll change the date and time,\nwhich is okay, and let me go ahead, and\n\n282\n00:13:53.276 --> 00:13:56.758\nwhat I'm gonna do,\nwe've talked about, in our commands,\n\n283\n00:13:56.758 --> 00:14:00.748\nwe've talked about some commands\nthat allow us to update policies.\n\n284\n00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:02.964\nWe talked about something\nknown as GP update, and\n\n285\n00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:05.410\nremember we said that that's\nto update group policy.\n\n286\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.260\nLike I said, I don't believe that\nthey're gonna talk too much or\n\n287\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.070\nexpect too much on the exam\nabout group policy.\n\n288\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.330\nBut they do mention in the objectives\nknowing that command, so\n\n289\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.522\nit is good to just have a little bit of\ninformation about group policy in general.\n\n290\n00:14:19.522 --> 00:14:23.156\nRemember that's just the way that we apply\nconfiguration settings like the past ones\n\n291\n00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:25.236\nthat we're talking about\nhere in this episode.\n\n292\n00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:28.779\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n293\n00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:30.766\nwe are going to update the policy.\n\n294\n00:14:30.766 --> 00:14:34.816\nAnd what should happen is it should reach\nout to that computer that we just set\n\n295\n00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:39.183\nthe password policy on and it should pull\nthat policy down, and it should apply any\n\n296\n00:14:39.183 --> 00:14:42.751\nof the settings that it sees that\nhas been changed on this machine.\n\n297\n00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:47.043\nAll right, now, it does look like the\ncomputer policy has updated successfully,\n\n298\n00:14:47.043 --> 00:14:47.974\nso that's good.\n\n299\n00:14:47.974 --> 00:14:52.053\nAnd we'll go ahead and what we're gonna do\nis we'll do a shut down here real quick,\n\n300\n00:14:52.053 --> 00:14:55.339\nwe've also talked about this\ncommand in another episode as well.\n\n301\n00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:58.392\nSo if you're not familiar with the\nshutdown command, we're gonna go ahead,\n\n302\n00:14:58.392 --> 00:15:00.164\nand we're just gonna restart this machine.\n\n303\n00:15:00.164 --> 00:15:03.764\nAnd I always do this because I've\nseen in the past [LAUGH] computers,\n\n304\n00:15:03.764 --> 00:15:05.163\ngotta love them, right?\n\n305\n00:15:05.163 --> 00:15:08.046\nI've seen in the past where you\nactually update a policy, and\n\n306\n00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:11.928\nyou do exactly what we've done, and Dan,\nI know you probably have to deal with this\n\n307\n00:15:11.928 --> 00:15:14.381\nmore often than not, or\nmore times than you want to.\n\n308\n00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:19.794\nWhere even though you did update it,\nit gave you a hard time, right?\n\n309\n00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.187\nIt does look like in the background\ntoo it's gonna do some updates, so\n\n310\n00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:23.579\nhopefully this doesn't take too long.\n\n311\n00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:27.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nsome group policies require a restart.\n\n312\n00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:32.378\nA logout just won't do,\neven though some of them say all you\n\n313\n00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:36.600\nneed to do is allow it or\nforce the update to it, yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.547\nJust try to do it normally, but\nif not, be prepared to do a restart.\n\n315\n00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:43.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's essentially what we're\ndoing here, we've got a restart happening.\n\n316\n00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:47.808\nAnd what we'll do is we're gonna turn\naround and we're gonna log back in as\n\n317\n00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:51.396\nthe student that we just basically\nlogged in as here on the machine.\n\n318\n00:15:51.396 --> 00:15:57.017\nAnd hopefully, if everything's going all\nright, if we've worked our magic here and\n\n319\n00:15:57.017 --> 00:16:00.636\nkinda tricked it a little bit,\nit should, hopefully,\n\n320\n00:16:00.636 --> 00:16:05.760\nbelieve That it is a later date than\nwhat that password policy said before.\n\n321\n00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.410\nBut again, we'll see, nope,\nit seems like it did not take it here.\n\n322\n00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.941\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n323\n00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:14.660\nAnd you know what?\n\n324\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.627\nI bet it didn't do that because\nof the fact that that computer,\n\n325\n00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:22.900\nor that account was just created.\n\n326\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.270\nSo it might still be within its time\nlimit there, so give me one second.\n\n327\n00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.190\nLet's sign out, let's try another.\n\n328\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.130\nLet's try another machine here real quick,\nor another account, excuse me.\n\n329\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.460\nWe'll pick on Dan again.\n\n330\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.950\nWe'll do Dan here, Dan's account.\n\n331\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.100\nAnd now I gotta see if I can\n\n332\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.713\nremember good old-\n&gt;&gt; My password.\n\n333\n00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:44.442\n&gt;&gt; Dan's password.\n\n334\n00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:48.950\nNope, that's not the password, we've\ngot a few of them here that I've tried.\n\n335\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.590\nAnd that's one of the things, when you\nstart changing passwords on camera here,\n\n336\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.860\nyou've gotta remember which\none was the password.\n\n337\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Actually brings up a good policy,\nis lock-out.\n\n338\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.020\nHow many times can someone\nattempt to login before they get,\n\n339\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.480\nyour account has been disabled\nbecause of too many login attempts?\n\n340\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.790\nThat's also a good password policy,\nto set inside of any environment.\n\n341\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and now it's picking up on\nthe fact that I actually required your\n\n342\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.110\npassword to be changed.\n\n343\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.380\nBut understand that this isn't\nthe expiration, that I was wanting.\n\n344\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.640\nYou'll see maybe Student01,\nbecause Student01 hasn't logged in, and\n\n345\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.800\nI also created that account beforehand.\n\n346\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.570\nSo let's see if I can get\nStudent01 machine up,\n\n347\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.800\nnope, and we'll try this one more time.\n\n348\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.417\nHold on, wait for it, wait for it.\n\n349\n00:17:37.417 --> 00:17:41.922\nTry to get this machine to,\nit says one day, it does look like,\n\n350\n00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:47.320\nI tell you what, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll go even more so here.\n\n351\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.920\nLet's do a,\nwe'll do a gpupdate on this side too.\n\n352\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.924\nNot that it really should matter\non the domain controller here.\n\n353\n00:17:56.924 --> 00:18:01.226\nWe'll do a gpupdate, a little\ntroubleshooting here right on camera.\n\n354\n00:18:01.226 --> 00:18:03.416\nAnd then worst case scenario,\n\n355\n00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:07.130\nwe can always restart\nthe server here as well, too.\n\n356\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.380\nAnd again,\nkeep in mind that the whole point of\n\n357\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.620\nshowing this is that the password\nshould expire, right?\n\n358\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.531\nYou want them to do some kind of\nexpiration within a certain time frame,\n\n359\n00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.810\nand why?\n\n360\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.240\nWell, if you have non-expiring passwords,\nthe problem is, it gives hackers all\n\n361\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.950\nthe time they need to run things\nlike password cracking utilities.\n\n362\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.895\nIf they can make their\nway into your network and\n\n363\n00:18:31.895 --> 00:18:34.880\ngather your user database, right?\n\n364\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.590\nWhere the users' passwords are stored and\n\n365\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.200\nthe passwords never change, then what\nthey can do is they can take that and\n\n366\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.785\nthey can run that through some of\nthe password cracking utilities.\n\n367\n00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:45.153\nAnd just sit there and\ntry to break the passwords.\n\n368\n00:18:45.153 --> 00:18:49.965\nAnd if your passwords do change, then\nwhat happens is yeah, they might crack\n\n369\n00:18:49.965 --> 00:18:53.525\nthe password, that maybe they've\nscraped and they've gained a hold of.\n\n370\n00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:56.945\nBut if the password's already\nchanged well, then guess what?\n\n371\n00:18:56.945 --> 00:18:58.075\nIt doesn't matter if they've cracked it,\n\n372\n00:18:58.075 --> 00:19:02.035\nwhat they've done is actually cracked\nan earlier or older password here.\n\n373\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.430\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna try this again one more time.\n\n374\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.040\nI could probably do this in\nthe background here, maybe.\n\n375\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.946\n&gt;&gt; So I was just looking up the amount\nof time it would take to crack an eight\n\n376\n00:19:12.946 --> 00:19:14.217\ncharacter password.\n\n377\n00:19:14.217 --> 00:19:19.056\nAnd it looks like at about a billion\npasswords a second, that being your speed,\n\n378\n00:19:19.056 --> 00:19:23.031\nyou can crack an eight character\npassword composed of using about\n\n379\n00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:26.640\n96 characters takes about 83 and\na half days.\n\n380\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.720\nSo now you start to see the importance\nof putting time limits and\n\n381\n00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.940\nexpiration dates on your password.\n\n382\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.420\nIf I make it a password never expires,\nwell in about 83 and a half days,\n\n383\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:43.360\nif someone were to be able to grab that\nhashed value for a password, in about 83\n\n384\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.050\nand a half days, they very well may have\nthat password in hand and able to log in.\n\n385\n00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.440\nSo that's why you see by default\nWindows sets it at 42 or 43 days.\n\n386\n00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.805\n&gt;&gt; 42 days, yeah, yep.\n\n387\n00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:54.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good, right?\n\n388\n00:19:54.925 --> 00:19:58.350\nAnd how long does it go if it\ngonna becomes nine characters?\n\n389\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.990\nSo as you increase the complexity of the\nlength, it starts creating a longer time.\n\n390\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.950\nAnd that's a brute force attack\nto go through each permutation.\n\n391\n00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.030\nYou also have to worry about\ndictionary attacks as well.\n\n392\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.160\nBut you take those both into account,\ndoing these things as you stack them\n\n393\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.395\ntogether, setting expiration dates,\nsetting log outs.\n\n394\n00:20:15.395 --> 00:20:19.591\nOr not log outs,\nwhere you've had too many login attempts,\n\n395\n00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:21.070\nand it disables an account.\n\n396\n00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.410\nYou start putting these things together,\n\n397\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:27.490\nit creates a really robust\noffense against password attacks.\n\n398\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, in fact, now that\nthe dates, my head's kinda covered it up.\n\n399\n00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.650\nYou can see this thought bubble\nhere that's kinda come up.\n\n400\n00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.970\nAnd it's letting me know that there's\nsomething wrong with the credentials,\n\n401\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.300\nit needs your current credential.\n\n402\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.530\nSo we're gonna try this one more time,\nwe're gonna log out as this user.\n\n403\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.720\nLet me see real quick, I can't\nremember which user I'm logged in as.\n\n404\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.075\nAll right, so let's log out as this user,\nand we'll try to login as a couple other\n\n405\n00:20:49.075 --> 00:20:52.190\nof the users that I've created\nhere inside of our system.\n\n406\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.050\nI'll try that Student01 or\nStudent02 again.\n\n407\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.250\nIt looks like it wasn't quite\nwithin the full one day there.\n\n408\n00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.330\nSo that very well could\nhave been the problem.\n\n409\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.880\nWell, and no that's not, that certainly\nit doesn't seem to be the problem here.\n\n410\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.260\nBut again, we'll try it one more time,\nand if not, we'll see what happens here.\n\n411\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:23.386\nAgain, what should happen is, when you\nare signing in and signing out, and\n\n412\n00:21:23.386 --> 00:21:25.206\nthis might be a computer policy.\n\n413\n00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:30.010\nI never even thought about that,\nDan, it might still have an old GPO.\n\n414\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.253\nI might actually have to run\nthe gpupdate here on it,\n\n415\n00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:39.673\nand update that password or\nthe GPO policy.\n\n416\n00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:40.350\nLet's try this.\n\n417\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.278\n&gt;&gt; Your domain isn't correctly spelled.\n\n418\n00:21:43.278 --> 00:21:43.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n419\n00:21:43.904 --> 00:21:46.486\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna try to log into demio.\n\n420\n00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:48.131\n&gt;&gt; Not exactly sure what that is.\n\n421\n00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:50.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah that's right\n\n422\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.720\n&gt;&gt; We don't have rights\n\n423\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.815\nto that there domain, do we, Wes?\n\n424\n00:21:51.815 --> 00:21:52.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, here's what I was trying to,\n\n425\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.790\nit took a little bit-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n426\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.360\n&gt;&gt; But we finally got it, right?\n\n427\n00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.814\nNotice the difference here,\ncuz I didn't wanna say, yeah,\n\n428\n00:21:57.814 --> 00:21:59.320\nnotice Dan's password had to change?\n\n429\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.870\nWell that's actually a setting that\nyou can do inside to make sure\n\n430\n00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.370\nthat the password's always unique.\n\n431\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.351\nBut this is what I\nwanted to show you here.\n\n432\n00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:06.977\nIt took a little bit to get there, but\n\n433\n00:22:06.977 --> 00:22:10.090\nnotice that it says the password\nhas expired and it must be changed.\n\n434\n00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.360\nNow, there's another thing\nI want you to keep in mind.\n\n435\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.860\nAnd I'll kind of show you\nthe password here in the background.\n\n436\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:20.114\nAll right, we also wanna make sure that\nwe have password history enforced too.\n\n437\n00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:22.964\nLet me see here if I can change it to,\n\n438\n00:22:22.964 --> 00:22:28.380\nsee which of the variations of\nthe password that I've tried.\n\n439\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.700\n&gt;&gt; All right so, let's go ahead and\n\n440\n00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.080\nlet's try to set it to the same password,\nand let's see what happens.\n\n441\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.860\nOkay, this is what I wanted to show you.\n\n442\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.090\nNotice it says,\nunable to update the password.\n\n443\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.170\nThe value provided for the new password\ndoes not meet the length, complexity, or\n\n444\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.922\nhistory requirements of the domain.\n\n445\n00:22:46.922 --> 00:22:50.490\nAll right, now remember that one of\nthe things Dan said is, you're kinda stair\n\n446\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.330\nstacking different components\nwithin a policy together, right?\n\n447\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.480\nYou're not only changing it every 42 days,\nbut there are other things.\n\n448\n00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.750\nThe length if you will, the character\nsets, in this case the history.\n\n449\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.870\nI can't turn it around and change\nthe password, right, to the same password,\n\n450\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.565\nbecause essentially that's\nreally not changing it, right?\n\n451\n00:23:06.565 --> 00:23:11.150\nIt doesn't really help you, so\nlet's go ahead and try this again.\n\n452\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.970\nI might have already set this password a\ncouple of times to the same values, right?\n\n453\n00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:20.510\nSo let me use another variation of\nthe default passwords that I use, and\n\n454\n00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.740\nsee if that works.\n\n455\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.520\nAnd again, that's one,\nsame thing is happening here right?\n\n456\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.700\nSo again, what you have to do is you\nhave to make sure that the password,\n\n457\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.360\nin this case, is unique.\n\n458\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.218\nIt can't be the same thing obviously, and\n\n459\n00:23:33.218 --> 00:23:36.373\nit can't be something that you've\nused in however many the history is.\n\n460\n00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:41.337\nAnd in this case, the domain policy says,\nyou have to use 24 unique passwords before\n\n461\n00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:44.170\nyou can ever recycle\na password essentially.\n\n462\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.330\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, how come I can't\njust change my password 24 times?\n\n463\n00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.071\nAnd then I'm back to my original\npassword [CROSSTALK] on train, right?\n\n464\n00:23:51.071 --> 00:23:52.319\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n465\n00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:54.929\nOne of the reasons you can't do that\nis something known as the minimum\n\n466\n00:23:54.929 --> 00:23:55.519\npassword age.\n\n467\n00:23:55.519 --> 00:24:00.439\nAnd the minimum password age was that one\nthat kinda went a little haywire on us.\n\n468\n00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:01.824\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that says,\n\n469\n00:24:01.824 --> 00:24:05.118\nyou have to use your password for\na minimum of one day, all right?\n\n470\n00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:07.106\nNow where does that come into play for us?\n\n471\n00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:12.170\nWell, just like Dan said, if it's got\n24 that you need to use uniquely,\n\n472\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.800\nwhat stops me from just 24\ntimes changing my password?\n\n473\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.820\nWell, if you have to use your password for\na minimum of one day,\n\n474\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.335\nit means it's gonna take me 24 days\nbefore I could ever reuse a password.\n\n475\n00:24:23.335 --> 00:24:27.820\nCuz I could change it, then I have to use\nit a day, then I can change it again, and\n\n476\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.710\nI have to use it a day.\n\n477\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.110\nSo I'll have to use it 24 days, so\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n478\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.800\nAnd again, I'm glad you brought it up,\n\n479\n00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.630\nbecause of the fact that it is\na combination of things, right?\n\n480\n00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.200\nNot just one thing that helps\nto secure our workstations and\n\n481\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.620\nour password best practices, right?\n\n482\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.140\nNow the other thing that I\nkinda wanna show in here,\n\n483\n00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.902\nand I know we're kinda running\nto the end on this one.\n\n484\n00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:49.940\nCuz we got a couple more cool things that\nwe kinda want to show you that you can do,\n\n485\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.190\nand you can require.\n\n486\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.870\nI've been doing this from a domain\nstandpoint, right, I'm actually taking\n\n487\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:59.470\nanother computer that's pushing out these\nsettings, and applying it to this machine.\n\n488\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.300\nI also want you ladies and gentlemen to\nknow, that if you have a professional or\n\n489\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.330\nbusiness edition of Windows,\nyou can also do this yourself.\n\n490\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.397\nAll you have to do is drop down,\nin this case, to the modern UI, Windows 7,\n\n491\n00:25:11.397 --> 00:25:14.720\nthe search functionality or\nthe run line will do this as well.\n\n492\n00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.201\nAnd you can actually type in gpedit,\ndot Mike-Sierra-Charlie there, or\n\n493\n00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:23.400\n.msc here, and you can launch\nthe local group policy editor.\n\n494\n00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.570\nI don't have the permissions, I'm in as\na standard user, but you can also do these\n\n495\n00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.420\nsame exact settings right here from\nthe local group policy as well.\n\n496\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.270\nAll right, now let's go ahead, and notice\nhow it's also giving me this warning,\n\n497\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.590\nit says consider changing your password.\n\n498\n00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.970\nRemember, I put the password\n[LAUGH] expiration down to one day.\n\n499\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.560\nSo, [LAUGH] it's kind of interesting,\nbecause I just changed the password.\n\n500\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.865\nIt says, your password expires today,\nyou might wanna consider changing it.\n\n501\n00:25:49.865 --> 00:25:53.570\nSo you do get a warning,\nin this situation,\n\n502\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.695\nyou're not gonna just be,\nunless you don't pay attention.\n\n503\n00:25:56.695 --> 00:26:00.513\n[LAUGH] You will get a warning that says,\nhey, it's been 42 days, or\n\n504\n00:26:00.513 --> 00:26:04.979\nin this case it'll be 41 days, you've\ngot 1 day left to use this password, and\n\n505\n00:26:04.979 --> 00:26:06.892\nyou need to consider changing it.\n\n506\n00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:10.410\nI want to let you guys and gals now out\nthere, if you're in a remote environment\n\n507\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.451\nand you're using remote desktop\nto connect into your machine, and\n\n508\n00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:16.450\nyou don't change that,\nyou won't be able to change it locally.\n\n509\n00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.500\nYou can't change the password over the\nremote connection, so what'll happen is,\n\n510\n00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.310\nyour password will expire, and\n\n511\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.000\nthen you won't be able to get back into\nyour machine from a home environment.\n\n512\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.820\nYou'll be calling the administrator\nlike Dan and saying,\n\n513\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.870\nhey Dan, I can't get into my machine,\ncan you reset it?\n\n514\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.340\nSo make sure that you do reset it in time,\nespecially for those of you that work from\n\n515\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.800\nhome and actually connect over\nthe Internet back into your work network.\n\n516\n00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.990\nAll right, so let me go ahead, and\none last thing here that I wanna show,\n\n517\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.935\nprobably have to go into a part two,\nbut let me go ahead and sign out.\n\n518\n00:26:45.935 --> 00:26:49.539\nA little crippled here in what I\ncan do as the standard user, and\n\n519\n00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:53.763\nI don't like having my wings clipped,\nthat's just the power trip in me.\n\n520\n00:26:53.763 --> 00:26:58.584\n[LAUGH] So let me go ahead, and\nI will log back in as the administrator,\n\n521\n00:26:58.584 --> 00:27:02.926\nand [LAUGH] it's gonna tell me\nmy password needs to be changed.\n\n522\n00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:05.866\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dan, why did you let me do that,\n\n523\n00:27:05.866 --> 00:27:08.430\nwhy didn't you talk some sense into me,\nsir?\n\n524\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.432\n[LAUGH] All right,\nlet's go ahead and type that again,\n\n525\n00:27:12.432 --> 00:27:17.838\ncuz apparently I did not do that right,\nwhich means one of these is wrong.\n\n526\n00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:20.451\nThere we go, let's try that,\nall right there we go.\n\n527\n00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:21.348\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n528\n00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:23.111\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Password's been changed, and\n\n529\n00:27:23.111 --> 00:27:25.585\n[LAUGH] now we're logging\nin as the administrator.\n\n530\n00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:28.315\nAnd one of the last things\nI wanted show you here,\n\n531\n00:27:28.315 --> 00:27:32.176\nat least in this first part as we\ntalk about password best practices,\n\n532\n00:27:32.176 --> 00:27:36.788\nis really just right-clicking on the\nWindows tile, going to the Control Panel.\n\n533\n00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:40.648\nAnd then we're gonna go to Appearance and\nPersonalization, all right, so\n\n534\n00:27:40.648 --> 00:27:41.625\nkeep that in mind.\n\n535\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.820\nAnd once we get into Appearance and\nPersonalization,\n\n536\n00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.550\nwe're gonna go to the Personalization.\n\n537\n00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.830\nI could use, let me kind of back up,\n\n538\n00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:58.260\ncuz I could use this Change\nscreen saver option as well.\n\n539\n00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.980\nAnd if I choose,\nChange screen saver, right,\n\n540\n00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.052\nit takes me to the location\nthat I want to be, as well.\n\n541\n00:28:04.052 --> 00:28:07.525\nAnd then if I change to, let's say I\nchange to 3D Text, right, and I change my\n\n542\n00:28:07.525 --> 00:28:10.423\nscreen saver, you might say, well Wes-\n&gt;&gt; That takes me back right there.\n\n543\n00:28:10.423 --> 00:28:11.191\n&gt;&gt; That does.\n[LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:11.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n545\n00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:13.879\n&gt;&gt; You gotta watch it when you're bored,\n\n546\n00:28:13.879 --> 00:28:14.893\nright, how fast.\n\n547\n00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:19.233\nIt's so funny, these used to be so slow,\nright, in the settings, they use to be so\n\n548\n00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:22.466\nslow because we didn't have\na lot of processing power today.\n\n549\n00:28:22.466 --> 00:28:25.357\nAnd now, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can give yourself motion sickness.\n\n550\n00:28:25.357 --> 00:28:27.979\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, you have to take some\n\n551\n00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:32.930\nDramamine, you hope that your [LAUGH]\nscreen saver doesn't kick in, right?\n\n552\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.940\nWell, you might say,\nwell wait a second Wes, screen savers?\n\n553\n00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.750\nI thought we really didn't have to worry\nabout the burn-in effect anymore on these\n\n554\n00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.110\nLED and LCD screens.\n\n555\n00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.720\nAnd, truth is, you really don't\nhave to worry about it, but\n\n556\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.840\nthis is a security setting.\n\n557\n00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.040\nAnd what I mean by that is, notice that it\nsays On resume, display the login screen?\n\n558\n00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.060\nThat's something that we want, right?\n\n559\n00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.863\nNow in Windows, you have what's\nknown as the Windows Key + L, and\n\n560\n00:28:55.863 --> 00:28:58.638\nyou should always be using it,\nthat locks your machine, right?\n\n561\n00:28:58.638 --> 00:29:02.440\nWindows Key + L locks my machine\nwhen I walk away from it.\n\n562\n00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.830\nI have an authentication screen, or\n\n563\n00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:08.040\na login dialog box,\nI have to log it back into the machine.\n\n564\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.378\nHowever, there are times when you're like,\nI got a call,\n\n565\n00:29:11.378 --> 00:29:13.990\ngotta take the call,\nyou walk away from your machine.\n\n566\n00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.260\nWell, remember one of\nthe things that Dan mentioned,\n\n567\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.930\nif you have a password written down,\nand you leave yourself logged in,\n\n568\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.090\nit's no different than writing\nyour password down, right?\n\n569\n00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.210\nEverybody can get into your machine,\nand there is no way for\n\n570\n00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.190\na machine to tell it isn't you,\nonce you're authenticated.\n\n571\n00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.490\nWhen you're logged in,\nyou lose what's known as,\n\n572\n00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.191\nessentially, nonrepudiation, right?\n\n573\n00:29:34.191 --> 00:29:37.870\nI can't sit there and say no, that\nwasn't me that did that, that was Dan.\n\n574\n00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.499\nDan come over here, he put the black hat\non, right, and he sat down at my computer.\n\n575\n00:29:41.499 --> 00:29:45.047\nAnd he sent out those emails to\nthe boss that says I hate my job,\n\n576\n00:29:45.047 --> 00:29:46.650\nhe can go stuff it, right?\n\n577\n00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.500\nWell, there's really no way\nthat anybody could prove that,\n\n578\n00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.880\nbecause you've left yourself logged in.\n\n579\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.420\nAnd this is kind of like a security for\nyourself as well, it says, if I walk away\n\n580\n00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.780\nfrom my computer, and I forget to lock it,\nright, at least it'll lock for me.\n\n581\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.050\nAnd then when the computer comes back from\nthe screen saver, what'll end up happening\n\n582\n00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.190\nis, it will require you to authenticate,\nand then you can change it there.\n\n583\n00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.070\nSo last little thing here, Dan, and I know\nwe only got through the first part here.\n\n584\n00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.810\nWe do have to look at some other things,\n\n585\n00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.130\nadditional things you have to\ndo inside of account management.\n\n586\n00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.605\nBut it looks like we're gonna have to go\ninto a part two to take care of those.\n\n587\n00:30:19.605 --> 00:30:22.404\n&gt;&gt; No problem-o sir, I'm looking\nforward to it, we do thank you Wes for\n\n588\n00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:24.650\nstopping by and\nlending your expertise on this.\n\n589\n00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.891\nIt's been a lot of fun, and passwords\nare obviously a very good place to build\n\n590\n00:30:28.891 --> 00:30:32.297\nup strength when it comes to\nsecurity inside of your network.\n\n591\n00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:34.836\nIt can also be a real point of weakness,\nso\n\n592\n00:30:34.836 --> 00:30:39.230\nwe have to really approach it with\nthe mindset of that layered defence.\n\n593\n00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.820\nUsing all the tools at our disposal\n\n594\n00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.650\nto really harden that point of\ncontact output that our attack vector.\n\n595\n00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.970\nSo that being said, we are out of time for\nthis episode, we will be back for\n\n596\n00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.970\npart two, a little more on security,\nso join us then.\n\n597\n00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.810\nAs for this episode,\nit's time to sign off for ITProTV,\n\n598\n00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.720\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n599\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n600\n00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.904\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:30:59.904 -->

00:00:12.380\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.180\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.160\nit's more in our A+ series so\nmuch fun, so little time, right?\n\n8\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.690\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain on that topic, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.460\nWes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.760\nWes, glad to have you yet again, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.490\nAnd how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.100\nGreat to be back here.\n\n14\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.420\nThat's right, we were talking in the first\npart of this little mini series here,\n\n15\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.860\nwe were talking about\nWorkstation Security.\n\n16\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.550\nActually, over the past few episodes,\n\n17\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.018\nwe've been talking about security in\ngeneral, but we're back with a part two.\n\n18\n00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:44.970\nAnd we've gotta finish up\njust a few of the objectives\n\n19\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.100\nthat we didn't get to\ntackle in the first part.\n\n20\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.730\nAnd in the first part, we were really just\ntalking about password best practices.\n\n21\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.800\nI will tell you, Dan,\nthere is one thing that I kind of forgot,\n\n22\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.250\nwhen it comes to work station security,\nwhen it comes to passwords.\n\n23\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.865\nWe talked heavily about, pretty much,\nthe operating system passwords, right?\n\n24\n00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:01.420\nAnd you've seen it.\n\n25\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.850\nIf you're not familiar with that,\ngo back and watch it.\n\n26\n00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.530\nI'm sure you guys and gals out there\nare already familiar with that.\n\n27\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.140\nBut if you're not, go back and\nwatch Part One, right?\n\n28\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.950\nBut there is another password that\nyou also have to consider too,\n\n29\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.900\nwhen it comes to work station security.\n\n30\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.620\nAnd this password is actually set,\nand it challenges you for\n\n31\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.000\nthe password, prior to the operating\nsystem ever loading up.\n\n32\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.370\nAnd it is one that they call out, and\n\n33\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.100\nwe've actually touched on\nthis in our BIOS episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.310\nAnd I wanna say that was one of\nthe very first of the 901 Episodes,\n\n35\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.840\nDan, that we shot.\n\n36\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.230\nWhere it basically allows you to set one\nof two different types of passwords.\n\n37\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.610\nYou can set a standard BIOS or UEFI, keep\nin mind, that's what we're talking about,\n\n38\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.610\nfirmware, right?\n\n39\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.340\nJust one is older than the other.\n\n40\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.780\nBut whether it's basic\ninput output system or\n\n41\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.090\nthe unified extensible firmware interface,\nyou can set two types of passwords.\n\n42\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.970\nYou can set what's known as a just basic\nBIOS password, and you can also set what's\n\n43\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.430\nknown as a supervisor, sometimes\ncalled an administrator password.\n\n44\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.190\nSo what do they do?\n\n45\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.900\nWell, let's tell you what\nboth of them do first,\n\n46\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.360\nbecause they both have a commonality and\n\n47\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.830\nthen one is a little bit different,\nall right?\n\n48\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.030\nBoth of them allow you to\nboot the operating system.\n\n49\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.650\nSo understand, when a BIOS password\nchallenges you, it's gonna be a very low\n\n50\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.020\nlevel text screen, because the video card\nhasn't even initiated, and it says, hey,\n\n51\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.240\nyou're gonna be allowed to\njust initiate hardware,\n\n52\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.950\nbring it online, and\nthen the operating system bootstraps.\n\n53\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.090\nNow I want you to understand that\nthis is platform independent,\n\n54\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.730\nit doesn't matter if we're talking\nabout a Windows operating system,\n\n55\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.850\nit doesn't matter if we're talking about\nLinux operating systems, Unix systems.\n\n56\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.260\nAnd I'm not really sure about the Mac,\n\n57\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.850\nI'll have to defer you guys to our Mac\nepisodes that we have on that honestly,\n\n58\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.150\nbut and that's just cuz they're very\nstrict on the hardware that they have.\n\n59\n00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.310\nBut in PC land, right,\nwe have what are known as,\n\n60\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.450\nwell, PC BIOS has passwords, right.\n\n61\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.030\nAnd both the regular BIOS password and the\nadministrator password allow you to turn\n\n62\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.750\nthe hardware on essentially after you log\nin, and then start the operating system.\n\n63\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.360\nNow the administrator or supervisor\npassword as it's called a lot as well,\n\n64\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.170\nallows you to do a little bit more.\n\n65\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.040\nAll right.\n\n66\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.680\nThat allows you to go into your BIOS\nsettings, your UEFI settings, and\n\n67\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.410\nmake changes within the BIOS, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.093\nAnd I'm using those interchangeably,\nguys and gals out there,\n\n69\n00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.850\ncuz keep in mind, we're talking about\npretty much again, just firmware.\n\n70\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.330\nAll right.\nAnd what the administrator or\n\n71\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.720\nsupervisor password allows you is not\nonly to bootstrap the operating system,\n\n72\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.365\nbut bring the hardware online and\nthe operating system can load.\n\n73\n00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:33.190\nAnd it allows you to get into the BIOS and\nmake changes, settings, and stuff,\n\n74\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.170\ninside of BIOS.\n\n75\n00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.730\nIf you have just the normal BIOS password.\n\n76\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.960\nAnd you can't get in the Bios, right?\n\n77\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.880\nWe can't press the key combination that\nbrings us into the setup screen right,\n\n78\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.510\nwe have to have that\nadministrator password.\n\n79\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.600\nNow I'm going to give you\na little piece of advice here,\n\n80\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.620\nnot for the exam, and I don't know\nif thisis gonna come in 902 or 901,\n\n81\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.460\nbecause this kinda blurs the line\nbetween software and hardware, right?\n\n82\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.670\nThat's why we call it firmware?\n\n83\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.540\nWell, it is how,\nwhy it gets its name right?\n\n84\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.270\nit's not quite hardware, but\nit's not quite software, right?\n\n85\n00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.340\nFirmware is that just basically\nmachine specific code\n\n86\n00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.330\nthat allows the hardware to come online.\n\n87\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.700\nThere might be a chance that you\nneed to reset that password.\n\n88\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.840\nAlright?\nAnd that means that somebody's forgot it.\n\n89\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.760\nA lot of times that's what will happen,\nsomebody forgets the password.\n\n90\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.210\nThe other thing that can happen to is if,\nmaybe you're in a tech situation where you\n\n91\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.980\nwork on a tech bench, and maybe you're\ngonna be the tech that actually receives,\n\n92\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.690\nlet's say, 50 computers that were\ndonated from an organization,\n\n93\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.720\nthat now wants to give them to a school.\n\n94\n00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.040\nAll right, well, they have their\nBIOS passwords potentially set and\n\n95\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.670\nturned on, and you don't know\nwhat those BIOS passwords are.\n\n96\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.130\nWell, what you can do,\nthere's a couple of things.\n\n97\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.460\nOne of the easiest things that you\ncan do to reset the BIOS password,\n\n98\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.190\nreach over to flip the CMOS battery out,\njust leave it out there for a few seconds.\n\n99\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.959\nBecause those settings are stored in CMOS,\nthose user defined settings.\n\n100\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.620\nNow, I will tell you more than that.\n\n101\n00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.110\nThere are little jumpers on the\nmotherboard that will allow you to pull\n\n102\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.589\nthe little fuse off, and rearrange it in a\ncertain way that also breaks the circuit.\n\n103\n00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.300\nIt is essentially doing the same\nthing as flipping the battery out.\n\n104\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.730\nIt is breaking that circuit.\n\n105\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.840\nOne of the great things\nabout motherboards today\n\n106\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.490\nis they actually have cemach reset buttons\non them, and I really like these because\n\n107\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.210\nyou really don't have to worry about\nflipping the CMOS battery out.\n\n108\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.110\nYou just reach over and push a button,\n\n109\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.100\nhold it in,\nyou'll see the light go off of the,\n\n110\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.160\nusually get some kind of LED diagnostic\nlight that'll just basically dissipate.\n\n111\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.510\nAnd it'll come back on when you let it go.\n\n112\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.724\nAll right, so do keep that in mind,\n\n113\n00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:30.780\ncuz there's a few different ways to do\nthat, it could come up on the exam.\n\n114\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.010\nAnd I have to tell you, you really\nshould be studying both 901 episodes and\n\n115\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.329\n902 episodes, really,\njust to get the full benefit, so\n\n116\n00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:42.689\nthat when you go on into either exam, you\nkinda know how the operating system and\n\n117\n00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.544\nthe hardware work together, cuz you really\ncan't have one without the other, right?\n\n118\n00:05:47.544 --> 00:05:50.216\nAll right, so\ndid want to take care of that.\n\n119\n00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:53.710\nIt is one that I didn't mention\nin our password management.\n\n120\n00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.870\nNow, there are other things\nthat we can do when it\n\n121\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.640\ncomes to basic workstation security.\n\n122\n00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.740\nAnd that's more related to\nthe account management side.\n\n123\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.780\nNow, Dan and I,\nwe talked about NTFS permissions and\n\n124\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.660\nshare permissions in another episode.\n\n125\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.600\nTo understand that the security that we're\ntalking about here with workstations,\n\n126\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.450\nthis isn't something that is\nWindows specific, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.160\nWhen I talk about restricting permissions,\nokay, doesn't matter if you're in Windows.\n\n128\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.250\nIt doesn't matter if you're in Unix,\ndoesn't matter if you're in Linux,\n\n129\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.012\nor if you're in Mac.\n\n130\n00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:25.660\nRight, and I say Mac, but\nMac basically uses a VST sub system, so\n\n131\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.670\nit's essentially under\nthe hood of Unix system.\n\n132\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.280\nAll right, you have permission sets also,\nACLs, and Unix based systems as well.\n\n133\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.346\nAll right.\n\n134\n00:06:34.346 --> 00:06:37.468\nI believe you get three permissions\nby default, and I can't remember,\n\n135\n00:06:37.468 --> 00:06:39.669\nI think it's already read,\nwrite, and execute,\n\n136\n00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.044\nI believe are the three\npermissions in those systems.\n\n137\n00:06:42.044 --> 00:06:44.220\nBut the point is you restricte them,\nright?\n\n138\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.340\nWe always use the principle of least\nprivilege, when it comes to counter\n\n139\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.750\nmanagement, doesn't matter which\nplatform you are, you're in, right?\n\n140\n00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.300\nIt means that you only give your users the\nlevel of access that they need, no more,\n\n141\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.870\nno less, right?\n\n142\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.790\nIt's why we've stressed in other episodes,\ndon't run as your Windows administrator.\n\n143\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.060\nDon't run as your root user,\nunless you need to.\n\n144\n00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.490\nAnd then once that privilege escalation\nthat you've just achieved is no longer\n\n145\n00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.380\nneeded, de-elevate it.\n\n146\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.423\nI don't know if that's a word.\n\n147\n00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:11.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'll make up a word right, you just\n\n148\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.500\nremove those privileges, so that you don't\nhave software and functionality that's\n\n149\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.900\nrunning in the background in the context\nof the most privileged user account.\n\n150\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.770\nAll right, so, what are some other things.\n\n151\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.340\nRestricting user permissions are one.\n\n152\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.990\nWe've already talked\nabout user permissions.\n\n153\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.430\nIf you're not aware of NTFS\npermissions inside of Windows,\n\n154\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.990\nwhich is probably gonna be something\nthat they're gonna ask you on the exam,\n\n155\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.040\nwe want you to go back over and\ncheck those out, all right.\n\n156\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.200\nWindows Security Settings, I believe,\nis what the episode was called there.\n\n157\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.420\nAll right now,\nthere's other things that we can do too.\n\n158\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.270\nAll right,\nsome of these are done by default and\n\n159\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.580\nthat's disabling the guest account.\n\n160\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.780\nAll right, the Guest account\nin Windows has been disabled.\n\n161\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.370\nIt doesn't matter if it's Windows Vista,\nWindows 7 or a Windows 8 or 8.1.\n\n162\n00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.970\nIn fact, I got a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n163\n00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.910\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n164\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.417\nSo if I Right Click on the desktop,\nand I go to Computer management.\n\n165\n00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:57.320\nAll right, remember,\n\n166\n00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.679\nthere's many different ways to\nget to computer management.\n\n167\n00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.639\nThis just happens to be one of the faster\nways that I like to get there.\n\n168\n00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.018\nAll right, and\nif I look at Local Users and Groups,\n\n169\n00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:11.300\nand I expand this out, and we have,\nwell, we have users, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.750\nI want you to notice that there\nare a few user accounts, right?\n\n171\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.860\nWe have Administrator and we have Guest.\n\n172\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.940\nNow you might have heard Dan and\nI talking about,\n\n173\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.830\nand I know myself showing you me logging\nin as an administrator, all right?\n\n174\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.160\nUnderstand that the first user that\nyou create on a Windows machine\n\n175\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.800\nis an administrative user, but\n\n176\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.651\nthat administrative account is in\nthe Administrator Group, right?\n\n177\n00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:36.008\nSo let me show you what I mean here,\nright?\n\n178\n00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:41.832\nAdmin, if I right-click and choose\nProperties, and I look at the Member Of\n\n179\n00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:48.213\ntab, I can see that Admin is a user that\nis in the Administrators group, all right?\n\n180\n00:08:48.213 --> 00:08:52.146\nNow, I don't wanna confuse you because I\nwant you to know that the most privileged\n\n181\n00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:55.550\naccount inside of Windows today,\nagain, is the Administrator.\n\n182\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.680\nBut notice the little black\ndown arrow in a white circle.\n\n183\n00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.916\nAll right, what that means, if I\nright-click and I look at Properties here,\n\n184\n00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:07.334\nnotice that it says that this\naccount is disabled, all right?\n\n185\n00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:09.370\nAnd let me kinda tell you why.\n\n186\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.444\nAll right, one of the things that is\ninside of Windows is when you have a user\n\n187\n00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:17.344\naccount you have what is known as\na Security Identifier, a SID, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:17.344 --> 00:09:18.981\nAnd it's a long string of characters,\n\n189\n00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:21.770\nand I don't even know if I can\nshow you one at this point.\n\n190\n00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.740\nSometimes they show up,\nsometimes they don't.\n\n191\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.140\nBut it's a long string of characters,\nall right?\n\n192\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.624\nAnd that string of characters is actually\nwhat the operating system uses to\n\n193\n00:09:30.624 --> 00:09:32.624\nidentify that user, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:36.613\nAnd the important thing to understand\nis that inside of Windows,\n\n195\n00:09:36.613 --> 00:09:41.253\nthe default administrator, I'm going\nall the way back to the days of XP when\n\n196\n00:09:41.253 --> 00:09:45.849\nit wasn't disabled like it is in Vista and\nbeyond, has a specific number.\n\n197\n00:09:45.849 --> 00:09:50.667\nIn fact, if I can remember right,\nI'm gonna shoot from the hip, Dan, here,\n\n198\n00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:53.886\nand you know what,\nthis always works well, right?\n\n199\n00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:54.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead,\n\n200\n00:09:54.668 --> 00:09:55.554\nwe're gonna go to reg edit.\n\n201\n00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:58.178\nI bet you I know where\nI can find this SID.\n\n202\n00:09:58.178 --> 00:10:00.880\nAgain, don't be messing with the registry,\nright?\n\n203\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.870\nBut I believe they're in HKEY users.\n\n204\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.305\nAnd if I, there we go, yeah.\n\n205\n00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:07.200\nSo I can show you some of\nthe security identifiers.\n\n206\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.750\nAll right, notice these,\nthese are the SIDs.\n\n207\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.470\nAll right, the security identifiers\nare how the operating system\n\n208\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.990\nidentifies the end user.\n\n209\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.540\nYou see these right here with\nthe 500 at the end of them?\n\n210\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.300\nGuess what they are?\n\n211\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.086\nThey're your Windows administrator.\n\n212\n00:10:22.086 --> 00:10:24.290\nIt's that disabled account, right?\n\n213\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.376\nWhat you guys, maybe you do realize,\nDan over here,\n\n214\n00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:30.139\nhe's got a black hat in his closet,\nall right?\n\n215\n00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:32.284\nHe's also got a white hat, and\nI don't know, maybe another one,\n\n216\n00:10:32.284 --> 00:10:33.253\na leather hat, too, right?\n\n217\n00:10:33.253 --> 00:10:35.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But he's got a black hat, okay?\n\n218\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.170\nAnd he knows that the default\nadministrative account\n\n219\n00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.530\nis the most powerful account.\n\n220\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.786\nAnd if he can get access to it,\n\n221\n00:10:41.786 --> 00:10:46.280\nhe can crack it, then he has privileged\naccess to the machine, all right?\n\n222\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.450\nThat is something that\nisn't uncommon knowledge.\n\n223\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.820\nThat is common knowledge out\nin the hacking community.\n\n224\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.483\nAll right, well, the problem is if you can\ngain access to the one that we know ends\n\n225\n00:10:57.483 --> 00:11:00.580\nin 500,\nI don't care what the other streaks are.\n\n226\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.602\nWhat do you think I might be able to do\nif I can gain access to that account?\n\n227\n00:11:03.602 --> 00:11:06.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with any dang\nthing you please [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.730\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, right?\n\n229\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.000\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the reasons for\nsecurity purposes,\n\n230\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.370\nthat administrative account is disabled,\nright?\n\n231\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.343\nBecause of that very fact.\n\n232\n00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:17.350\nDoesn't matter, they tell you,\nrename the account, right?\n\n233\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.000\nWell, you can rename\nthe account all you want,\n\n234\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.090\nit's still gonna have that same\n500 at the end of the SID.\n\n235\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.160\nAnd that's why it's disabled.\n\n236\n00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.500\nBut this is more about the other\naccounts that you have, right?\n\n237\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.950\nThe other account that you have, and\nthey kind of call out the guest account.\n\n238\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.852\nAnd again, a guest account, again,\nis a limited account, if you will.\n\n239\n00:11:34.852 --> 00:11:42.020\nI notice it says built in for\nguest access to the computer or domain.\n\n240\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.746\nWell, I don't want anybody to just\nhave guest access to my operating\n\n241\n00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:45.597\nsystem, all right?\n\n242\n00:11:45.597 --> 00:11:47.969\nAnd again,\nsince Vista it's already been disabled.\n\n243\n00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:52.133\nThey tell you that the good security\npractices are to go ahead and disable it.\n\n244\n00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:55.845\nBut I want you to know inside of a Windows\nenvironment it is disabled by default.\n\n245\n00:11:55.845 --> 00:12:00.046\nAnd in fact, even in a lot of access\npoints and wireless communications,\n\n246\n00:12:00.046 --> 00:12:03.997\nyou'll see that the guest account\nis actually disabled by default.\n\n247\n00:12:03.997 --> 00:12:06.470\nSo do wanna make mention of that, too.\n\n248\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.120\nNow some of the other things that you\ncan do inside of Account Management.\n\n249\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.420\nThey talk about failed attempt lock-outs,\nall right?\n\n250\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.870\nAnd what do we mean by failed\nattempt lock-outs, all right?\n\n251\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.040\nWell, we talked about it\nin the first part, and Dan,\n\n252\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.540\nI believe it was you that mentioned this.\n\n253\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.130\nThat when it comes to\nprotecting passwords,\n\n254\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.570\nit isn't just a single setting that\nwill protect the password, right?\n\n255\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.360\nIt's a collection of things, right?\n\n256\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.540\nNot only do we have password expirations,\nwe have things like password history,\n\n257\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.881\npassword complexities.\n\n258\n00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.067\nYou mentioned character set, you even\ngave us an example of a nine character,\n\n259\n00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:41.888\nI think it was, password on how many\ndays that it would take, right?\n\n260\n00:12:41.888 --> 00:12:44.800\nIt was 80 days or\njust around there, right?\n\n261\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.007\nSo what do we need to worry about when\nit comes to other things that we can\n\n262\n00:12:50.007 --> 00:12:55.600\ndo to make passwords more resilient\nto password-based attacks, right?\n\n263\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.070\nWe talked about dictionary attacks.\n\n264\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.430\nWe've talked about some of the other\nattacks, brute force attacks,\n\n265\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.670\nthat are out there guessing and\njust randomly typing passwords, right?\n\n266\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.360\nWell, this software usually works\non some kind of automated approach,\n\n267\n00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.879\nwith the exception of guessing, right?\n\n268\n00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:10.820\nGuessing isn't an automated approach,\nright?\n\n269\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.170\nBut it's gonna work on constantly trying\npasswords over and over and over.\n\n270\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.471\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, if I want to even stop\nthings like guessing attacks on a machine,\n\n271\n00:13:21.471 --> 00:13:25.640\nI don't want somebody just randomly\nwalking into my building and\n\n272\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.013\ntyping as many passwords as they can,\ntry to guess.\n\n273\n00:13:29.013 --> 00:13:31.839\nWe can do what are known as\nlockout thresholds, all right?\n\n274\n00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:32.927\nAnd let me go ahead and show you.\n\n275\n00:13:32.927 --> 00:13:36.953\nAnd this is defined at the domain level,\nso I should be able to just do this\n\n276\n00:13:36.953 --> 00:13:40.781\nlocally rather than switching back\nover to the domain controller and\n\n277\n00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:43.630\nworrying about it like I\ndid in the first part here.\n\n278\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.020\nSo we're gonna go, and by the way, you\ndon't have to have a domain controller.\n\n279\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.610\nIf you have the professional level\nedition or business editions and\n\n280\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.350\nbeyond of your Windows machine,\nyou can do this as well\n\n281\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.240\nwithout ever setting up a second computer,\nwhich is also a good thing to have.\n\n282\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.270\nSo we've kind of shown you a couple of\ndifferent things that are going on,\n\n283\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:58.790\nall right?\n\n284\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.830\n&gt;&gt; And one of the secondary benefits\nof setting a threshold here is that\n\n285\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.800\nif someone is trying to break in through\na password as an attack vector, then\n\n286\n00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.774\nyou're gonna know about it very quickly\nbecause your user's gonna try to log in,\n\n287\n00:14:11.774 --> 00:14:13.800\nit's gonna say my account is disabled.\n\n288\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.350\nOr if this is your personal machine,\nyou go to log in and\n\n289\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:21.910\nit says your account is disabled due\nto over abundance of login attempts.\n\n290\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.360\nWell, I didn't over abundantly try\nto login and get failed attempts,\n\n291\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.170\nI know my own password.\n\n292\n00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.950\nThat's going to cue you up to\nthe fact that something is happening.\n\n293\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.610\nAnd now you're gonna pay attention, you're\nprobably gonna start looking at logs,\n\n294\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.860\nseeing where that login was coming from.,\nMaybe somebody came to your computer and\n\n295\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.100\ntried to login multiple times and met that\nthreshold, and then moved on to the next\n\n296\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.458\nblock because obviously, no,\nthe account is locked out now.\n\n297\n00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:47.678\nSo that could be a really good indication\nthat something is happening and\n\n298\n00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:49.382\nnow you'll start paying attention.\n\n299\n00:14:49.382 --> 00:14:52.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now you have, again,\nyou have that repudiation, right?\n\n300\n00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:56.265\nI can find out that it's\nhappening through audit trail.\n\n301\n00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:59.235\nSo let me go ahead and show you,\nall right, where you can configure this.\n\n302\n00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:02.105\nAnd in fact, Dan, because you mentioned\nthat, I think I might want end up\n\n303\n00:15:02.105 --> 00:15:05.255\nswitching over to the domain controller so\nthat I can show you then the exact thing\n\n304\n00:15:05.255 --> 00:15:07.735\non the properties of the account,\nhow it does get locked out.\n\n305\n00:15:07.735 --> 00:15:10.745\nBut either way,\nthe policy is gonna be the same, right?\n\n306\n00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:14.755\nSo if I go down to my computer\nconfiguration, we expand out Windows\n\n307\n00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:19.850\nsettings, ad we wait for it, and\nwe expand out security settings.\n\n308\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.030\nA little bit different, right?\n\n309\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.430\nWe've been talking about account policies,\nand there is password policies here.\n\n310\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.330\nBut now what we're going is we're gonna\ngo ahead and go to account policies.\n\n311\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.193\nNow I could expand this out, and I love\nhow it just makes the triangle disappear.\n\n312\n00:15:31.193 --> 00:15:34.989\n[LAUGH] But notice that there is\nthis Account lockout duration,\n\n313\n00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:40.210\nthreshold if you will, and reset account\nlockout counter after, all right?\n\n314\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.030\nNow notice that it tells me how many\ninvalid attempts do I wanna allow\n\n315\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.435\nbefore it locks the machine out.\n\n316\n00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:48.590\nAnd by default it's set to zero, right?\n\n317\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.090\nWell, then, that just means that,\nhey, there is no lockout count.\n\n318\n00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.770\nWe're not counting here, right?\n\n319\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.030\nBut I could actually manipulate this.\n\n320\n00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.888\nAnd like I said, Dan,\nI like where your mind was at, so\n\n321\n00:15:57.888 --> 00:16:00.250\nI think what I'm gonna\ndo is I'll go ahead and\n\n322\n00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.233\nshow you guys how to log in to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's like I've done this before.\n\n323\n00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:04.495\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's weird.\n\n324\n00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:05.389\nWeird.\n\n325\n00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:06.647\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You poor soul.\n\n326\n00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:08.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\n\n327\n00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:10.089\n[LAUGH] what we'll go ahead and\n\n328\n00:16:10.089 --> 00:16:14.333\ndo here is, we'll show you how you would\ndo this in a corporate environment.\n\n329\n00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:17.913\nAnd I can kind of show you, piggyback\noff of Dan's explanation here, and\n\n330\n00:16:17.913 --> 00:16:20.010\nkind of show you the hands on here, right?\n\n331\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.296\nSo if I go to my server manager,\nand again,\n\n332\n00:16:22.296 --> 00:16:26.119\nyou're gonna see that the settings\nare gonna be just the same, right?\n\n333\n00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.504\nI will open up our\nGroup Policy Management,\n\n334\n00:16:28.504 --> 00:16:31.673\njust get to it a little bit\ndifferent inside of the domain.\n\n335\n00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:36.212\nBut if I go ahead, and I edit\nthe policy here, we're gonna be, again,\n\n336\n00:16:36.212 --> 00:16:38.346\nunder Computer Configuration.\n\n337\n00:16:38.346 --> 00:16:40.721\nWe're gonna be looking at\nour Windows Settings, and\n\n338\n00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:43.190\nwe're gonna be under Security Settings.\n\n339\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.780\nAll right so for the most part,\na couple of things change in the path, but\n\n340\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.220\nI don't want you to worry about that.\n\n341\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.470\nBut notice that again, we're talking\nabout Account Policies, right, and\n\n342\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.300\nunder Account Policies I\nhave Lockout Policies.\n\n343\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.836\nNow you guys will go on to learn that the\nreason there's another in here is because\n\n344\n00:16:58.836 --> 00:17:02.177\nthis is the protocol that allows you\nto authenticate into a Windows domain.\n\n345\n00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:05.203\nBut again, don't worry about that right\nnow, just a little tidbit out there for\n\n346\n00:17:05.203 --> 00:17:07.562\nthose of you that are going on\nto additional training for that,\n\n347\n00:17:07.562 --> 00:17:08.940\nincluding things like Network+.\n\n348\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.460\nSo, hint, hint, hint,\ncheck out our Network+ content.\n\n349\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.550\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and I'm gonna\nchange this up a little bit, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.073\nI'm gonna go ahead and what I'm gonna do\nis, we'll get you guys motion sick here.\n\n351\n00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:21.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n352\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.950\nchoose, the Account will not lock out,\nright, I'm gonna change that.\n\n353\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.306\nNow it says the Account will lock out\nafter one invalid attempt, all right?\n\n354\n00:17:30.306 --> 00:17:32.240\n&gt;&gt; I like that, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly,\n\n355\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.210\nnow you wanna talk about\nincreasing your stress, right?\n\n356\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:36.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n357\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Increasing your blood pressure and\n\n358\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.530\nthe administrative complexities to\nmanaging your passwords, right?\n\n359\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.762\nWe've mentioned this\nthroughout this series, too,\n\n360\n00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.665\nwhen we're talking about security, right?\n\n361\n00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.900\nIt's old Lady Liberty out there,\nif you will, it's a balance, right?\n\n362\n00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.731\nBecause we could say, you know what,\nif you don't type your password in right,\n\n363\n00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:55.234\nI'm gonna lock you out.\n\n364\n00:17:55.234 --> 00:17:57.399\nI'd have been locked out in\nevery show that I've shown-\n\n365\n00:17:57.399 --> 00:17:58.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes you would have!\n\n366\n00:17:58.733 --> 00:18:02.775\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that would not be good,\nbecause I want you to think about it,\n\n367\n00:18:02.775 --> 00:18:06.903\neven in worst case scenario is,\nyou're gonna be locked out regardless.\n\n368\n00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:09.868\nBut even best case scenario, how about the\nperson that comes in on Monday morning and\n\n369\n00:18:09.868 --> 00:18:11.850\nneeds to log in before they've\nhad their cup of coffee.\n\n370\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.621\nWell it doesn't matter, I've had three\ncups of coffee, and still can't log in.\n\n371\n00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:16.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:18:16.293 --> 00:18:17.493\n&gt;&gt; Let alone if you've had four or five,\n\n373\n00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:18.738\nmaybe you're just [LAUGH] too jittery.\n\n374\n00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:22.775\nSo you can actually, yeah, you can\nincrease security, but your convenience\n\n375\n00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:26.520\nlevel, right, and your stress level\nI guess, is going to go up as well.\n\n376\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.045\n[LAUGH] But your convenience\nlevel is definitely gonna win, so\n\n377\n00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:30.411\nit's always that fine balance.\n\n378\n00:18:30.411 --> 00:18:32.432\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust do three for this sake,\n\n379\n00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:34.280\nyou might do something like five,\nall right?\n\n380\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.410\nAnd there are some settings that they tell\nyou that they're going to go ahead and\n\n381\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.300\nset, because if you set\na lock out threshold, or\n\n382\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.720\na lockout, how many invalid attempts.\n\n383\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.870\nAnd you don't set how long\nthey're gonna be locked out,\n\n384\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.790\nwell it doesn't really benefit you, right?\n\n385\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.610\n&gt;&gt; No, they got to call the help desk, or\nsomebody with administrative credentials,\n\n386\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.670\nso they can manually unlock your account.\n\n387\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.927\n&gt;&gt; Right exactly, and that's we're gonna\ngo ahead and do, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n388\n00:18:59.927 --> 00:19:01.120\nsay OK to this.\n\n389\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.837\nAnd I believe the lockout,\nlet me check, no it's not this,\n\n390\n00:19:05.837 --> 00:19:09.088\nit's the duration, reset the counter.\n\n391\n00:19:09.088 --> 00:19:13.426\nAnd okay, so we're good, I just wanted\nto make sure that I'm not missing that\n\n392\n00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:15.960\nsetting here, okay, so there we go.\n\n393\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.570\nAll right, now we've got this set,\nwhat I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\n\n394\n00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:24.890\ngo ahead essentially, and apparently try\nto open something that's not gonna open.\n\n395\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.950\nIt's the Windows Store, it doesn't\nlike low resolution, well that's okay,\n\n396\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.395\nI'm not trying to open that anyways.\n\n397\n00:19:29.395 --> 00:19:32.829\nLet's go ahead and we're gonna fire\nup our command prompt, all right?\n\n398\n00:19:32.829 --> 00:19:37.261\nAnd essentially what I'm gonna do is run\ngpupdate, with the force option here,\n\n399\n00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:40.190\nright, these are the droids\nyou're looking for.\n\n400\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.280\nEssentially what I wanna do is, I wanna\nforce this machine to reach out to that\n\n401\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.896\ndomain controller, and\nthat centralized machine.\n\n402\n00:19:46.896 --> 00:19:50.986\nAnd I want it to pull down these settings\nso that we can show you here on camera.\n\n403\n00:19:50.986 --> 00:19:56.120\nAnd then what we're gonna do is, we're\ngonna forget to type our password, right?\n\n404\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.267\nAnd you're probably saying, Wes,\n\n405\n00:19:57.267 --> 00:19:58.719\nyou don't need any help with that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You just-\n\n406\n00:19:58.719 --> 00:19:59.650\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna go ahead-\n\n407\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.721\n&gt;&gt; Try to log in as normal, Wes.\n\n408\n00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:03.470\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] All right?\n\n409\n00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.084\n[LAUGH] So we'll go ahead, and\nI'm gonna go ahead real quick, and\n\n410\n00:20:07.084 --> 00:20:08.670\nI'll just do a log off here.\n\n411\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:15.800\n&gt;&gt; I'll sign out as the administrator,\nand we'll go ahead and, since Dan's so\n\n412\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.170\nnice to me in this episode here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.917\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna type Dan, right, and\n\n414\n00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:23.945\nI'm just gonna run my hand across the\nkeyboard, run my hand across the keyboard.\n\n415\n00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:26.759\nWe're gonna see, hopefully this works,\nrun my hand across the keyboard, and\n\n416\n00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:27.861\nthat was the third time right?\n\n417\n00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.748\n&gt;&gt; That was the third time.\n\n418\n00:20:29.748 --> 00:20:30.318\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n419\n00:20:30.318 --> 00:20:33.778\n&gt;&gt; And there we go, and this is what Dan's\ntalking about when he says, hey, man,\n\n420\n00:20:33.778 --> 00:20:37.160\n[LAUGH] I've gotten these calls\nmore than you would like to know.\n\n421\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.690\nAll right, notice it says, The referenced\naccount is currently locked out and\n\n422\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.890\nmay not be logged in to.\n\n423\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.800\nAll right, so let me go ahead and,\nI know Dan's password,\n\n424\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.650\nlet me type Dan's password.\n\n425\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.418\nWell it doesn't matter now that I\nknow the password, it is locked out.\n\n426\n00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:52.850\nAnd this is what he meant when he said,\n\n427\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.791\nthen you have to have an administrator\naround to unlock the account, right?\n\n428\n00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:59.139\n&gt;&gt; Or wait the 30 minutes.\n\n429\n00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:01.275\n&gt;&gt; Or wait the 30 minutes,\ngood point, good point,\n\n430\n00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:03.280\nright, cuz that duration is there.\n\n431\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.383\nSo now what I have to do is,\nhe receives the call, all right,\n\n432\n00:21:07.383 --> 00:21:11.958\nand we go over to the location,\nand where his account is stored.\n\n433\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:16.898\nAnd I right-click and I choose, somewhere\nin the list, Properties, and then Account,\n\n434\n00:21:16.898 --> 00:21:19.330\nnotice what it says, Unlock the account.\n\n435\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.940\nThis account is currently locked\nout on Active Directory on this\n\n436\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.810\nDomain Controller.\n\n437\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.516\nSo what I have to do, or what he was\nsaying that he would do in a business\n\n438\n00:21:27.516 --> 00:21:30.288\nsituation is exactly this, choose OK.\n\n439\n00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:32.859\nNow I honestly don't remember Dan's\npassword, so we might turn around and\n\n440\n00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:35.342\nlock-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a bummer.\n\n441\n00:21:35.342 --> 00:21:40.256\n&gt;&gt; Lock myself out again as we speak, And\n\n442\n00:21:40.256 --> 00:21:40.963\nI still-\n&gt;&gt; There it is, you got it.\n\n443\n00:21:40.963 --> 00:21:42.690\n&gt;&gt; It requires a change,\nbut I got it, right?\n\n444\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.816\nSo let me go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; A little hold over from\n\n445\n00:21:45.816 --> 00:21:46.350\nthe previous show-\n\n446\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:21:46.852 --> 00:21:48.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\n\n448\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.010\nwe'll go ahead and\ntry to just change his password here.\n\n449\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.149\nAnd we'll log, and that's not gonna work,\nwe'll try that one more time.\n\n450\n00:22:00.302 --> 00:22:04.782\nThis is what happens when you change\nyour passwords multiple times on,\n\n451\n00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.883\nyou know what, I know what I can do.\n\n452\n00:22:06.883 --> 00:22:10.403\nI can do what every user does, right,\n\n453\n00:22:10.403 --> 00:22:13.750\nwe will just add-\n&gt;&gt; A number to the end-\n\n454\n00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.383\n&gt;&gt; A 1 to the end of it, right,\n\n455\n00:22:15.383 --> 00:22:17.166\ncuz that makes it more secure.\n\n456\n00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:21.272\nThere we go, so anyhow,\nnotice that it required\n\n457\n00:22:21.272 --> 00:22:26.630\nan administrator to allow him\nto log back in, all right?\n\n458\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.770\nOr in this case, help desk,\n\n459\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.160\nif it happens to be him that's\nthe Systems Administrator.\n\n460\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.526\nAnd now like he said,\nagain kind of piggybacking off of that,\n\n461\n00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:36.395\nyou're aware that something\nlike this is going on.\n\n462\n00:22:36.395 --> 00:22:39.570\nNow again it's up to you to find out,\nis this happening maliciously, or\n\n463\n00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.340\nit's somebody like Wes who can't\ntype to save their life, all right?\n\n464\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.410\nAnd either way,\nthe end result's gonna be the same, right,\n\n465\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.010\nso again, remember the balance\nin security, all right?\n\n466\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.555\nAll right so that is some of the things\nthat you can do, the other thing\n\n467\n00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:58.362\nthat you can do, too, is you can do\nthings like time of day restrictions.\n\n468\n00:22:58.362 --> 00:23:03.312\nAnd let me go ahead, I'm gonna switch\nback over to my domain controller here,\n\n469\n00:23:03.312 --> 00:23:07.824\nand just because I cannot, for\nthe life of me, remember the password,\n\n470\n00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:15.081\nI'm gonna go ahead and reset student01's\npassword, there we go, because I can't,\n\n471\n00:23:15.081 --> 00:23:16.928\nfor the life of me, [LAUGH] remember it.\n\n472\n00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:21.240\nAll right, now I can also set time\nof day restrictions, too, and again,\n\n473\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:28.885\nwhen you talk about, they call it login\ntime restrictions on your exam objectives.\n\n474\n00:23:28.885 --> 00:23:32.570\nBut they call it a little bit\ndifferent here in the Windows,\n\n475\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.790\nthey just basically says login hours,\nright?\n\n476\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.312\nAnd what I can do is, let's see what time\nis it, this says 8 AM, let me make sure,\n\n477\n00:23:39.312 --> 00:23:42.020\nwe're not up to date here,\nso that says 11 AM.\n\n478\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.720\nYou know what I bet it is?\n\n479\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.479\nI bet it's Eastern Time versus\nSpecific Time, [LAUGH] or Pacific Time.\n\n480\n00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:49.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n481\n00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:54.327\nthat's probably it, so it's on Bill Gates\ntime there, out there at Redmond, for\n\n482\n00:23:54.327 --> 00:23:57.485\nour Redmond viewers out there\nthat might be watching.\n\n483\n00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.520\nAll right, let me go ahead and\nclose this down,\n\n484\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.650\nbecause you'll see that\nit didn't like that.\n\n485\n00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.969\nIt said, well wait a second, you got\ntime of day restrictions open here, and\n\n486\n00:24:06.969 --> 00:24:07.982\nyou just changed the time of day.\n\n487\n00:24:07.982 --> 00:24:08.634\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:09.194\n&gt;&gt; So you might wanna close\n\n489\n00:24:09.194 --> 00:24:09.811\nthat down and refresh it.\n\n490\n00:24:09.811 --> 00:24:14.127\nAll right, so now that I got the time and\nthe clock right here, let's go ahead and\n\n491\n00:24:14.127 --> 00:24:16.287\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna do,\n\n492\n00:24:16.287 --> 00:24:18.880\nnotice that it says\nlogin is permitted here.\n\n493\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.590\nWell, I can actually say, you know what,\n\n494\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:26.430\nI don't want somebody to be logged\nin let's just say from eight now.\n\n495\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.010\nObviously, you probably wouldn't do it\nthis way, but you'll see that there was-\n\n496\n00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:30.434\n&gt;&gt; It's night shift [LAUGH].\n\n497\n00:24:30.434 --> 00:24:31.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n498\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.860\nGood point, it could be the night shift.\n\n499\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.130\nSo from 8 AM to 6 pm daytime,\nI don't want anybody logging in, right?\n\n500\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.830\nAnd which is okay.\n\n501\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.140\nAll right, so we applied that.\n\n502\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.650\nWhich is okay, one more time.\n\n503\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:48.620\nAnd now, let's go ahead and let's log out.\n\n504\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.061\nAll right, so enough picking on Dan.\n\n505\n00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:51.316\nTake that.\n\n506\n00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:54.264\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and we'll sign out and\n\n507\n00:24:54.264 --> 00:24:58.670\nwhat we'll do is we'll log back\nin here hopefully I stood no one.\n\n508\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.530\nAnd what we should see is that,\n\n509\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.830\nit's gonna tell us that there's\nsome kind of problem logging in.\n\n510\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.660\nIt means again, hey,\nI'm gonna reach out and\n\n511\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.410\nwhen I send the authentication\ncredentials across the network,\n\n512\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:16.020\nI'm gonna look at the properties\nof that account essentially.\n\n513\n00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:22.830\nWhere actually the server will do that,\nit's gonna say I'm not so sure about that.\n\n514\n00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.300\nAll right, because your account\nhas time restrictions that\n\n515\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.220\nprevent you from signing in at this time.\n\n516\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.750\nPlease try again later.\n\n517\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.650\nGreat example Dan,\nhey it's the night shift,\n\n518\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.650\nyou're not supposed to be logged in,\nright?\n\n519\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.390\nRemember we talked about principle\nat least privilege, right?\n\n520\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.620\nWell this isn't permissions, but\nit's a privilege to log on to a machine.\n\n521\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.020\nIt's called an interactive logon.\n\n522\n00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.570\nIt's actually a right in Windows.\n\n523\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.150\nIt's privilege, right?\n\n524\n00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:49.210\nAnd if you're gonna give\nthe least amount of privileges,\n\n525\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.110\nwell then you don't need\naccess to our machine.\n\n526\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.370\nYou don't need access to our corporate\nnetworks if you aren't on shift.\n\n527\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.200\nWe can do something like time\nof day restrictions, all right.\n\n528\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.132\nSo that's another thing\nthat you can do too.\n\n529\n00:25:59.132 --> 00:26:03.000\nWe kind of talked about our time out and\na screen lock, right.\n\n530\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.920\nKeep in mind that you can set\nthat up through the screen saver.\n\n531\n00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.880\nLet's go ahead and switch this,\n\n532\n00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.270\nand I have no clue if I have\nthe password right on this.\n\n533\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.476\nSo we're gonna try a whole\nbunch of them here,\n\n534\n00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:17.809\nand we'll see if we don't\nget locked out again.\n\n535\n00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:20.790\n[LAUGH] I have to go unlock this account.\n\n536\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.020\nSo it does look like it's logging in here.\n\n537\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.660\nKeep in mind that the Windows key+L,\nagain will lock the machine.\n\n538\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.680\nNotice that I did that little\nshort cut right there,\n\n539\n00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.350\nWindows key+L, that locks, right?\n\n540\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.830\nYou can also do this as a time out,\n\n541\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:37.250\nas part of the screen saver,\nthat locks the machine likewise.\n\n542\n00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.281\nOne of the last things I kinda wanna\naddress here, I probably should, well,\n\n543\n00:26:42.281 --> 00:26:47.860\nI'll elaborate my privileges here, is they\ntalk about hings like disabling autorun.\n\n544\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.428\nDo you want when somebody plugs a USB\ndevice in, do you want it to automatically\n\n545\n00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:55.010\nlook at that device and if there's an\napplication on it,do you want it to run?\n\n546\n00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.855\nIf you have things like for instance,\nan optical disc that has some kind\n\n547\n00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:03.670\nof autorun.exe in it, right,\ndo you want that to run?\n\n548\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.830\nAnd chances are you don't want it to run.\n\n549\n00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.317\nSo you gonna wanna be able\nto disable that, right.\n\n550\n00:27:07.317 --> 00:27:09.550\nWell, let me show you how\nyou can do that in Windows.\n\n551\n00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.910\nIf I drop down to the control panel here,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n552\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.180\ndo that, drop down to control panel.\n\n553\n00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.300\nAll right,\nnow this is a little bit different here\n\n554\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.370\nagain because you might think, well,\nthat's in system and security, right?\n\n555\n00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.870\nWell, be careful with this one, right?\n\n556\n00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.620\nThis is actually in hardware and\nsound and that's autoplay.\n\n557\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.050\nNow, it's gonna be right there at\nthe forefront if you've changed\n\n558\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.180\nthe view from category\nto view to large icons.\n\n559\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.540\nBut notice autoplay here, when I bring\nup autoplay it allows me to say,\n\n560\n00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:42.030\nhey, what do I want to do when\nsomebody plugs in a USB drive?\n\n561\n00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.570\nIn this case, they're just\nclassified as a removable drive.\n\n562\n00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.090\nI wanna say take no action.\n\n563\n00:27:47.356 --> 00:27:51.070\nOr ask me, right, now you could control\nthis like we've been showing you through\n\n564\n00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:56.110\nother settings as well, but\nkeep in mind that you can do that.\n\n565\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.670\nAgain, choosing what to do with each\ntype of media, camera storage and\n\n566\n00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:05.225\nyou can see DVDs as well, again because\nthere are things that run on DVDs.\n\n567\n00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:09.863\nRight, Blu-Ray, CDs as well,\nand then also, if you will,\n\n568\n00:28:09.863 --> 00:28:12.980\nresetting the devices too, all right.\n\n569\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.920\n&gt;&gt; That's really good because hackers love\nto do this little trick where they'll\n\n570\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.650\ntake some USB flash drives,\n\n571\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.040\nput malicious software on them and\nthen go throw them in a parking lot.\n\n572\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.590\nAnd somebody walks by and they see,\nthere's a thumb drive laying on\n\n573\n00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:29.370\nthe ground, freebie, sweet, man, it's\nawesome, 500 gigabytes, excellent man.\n\n574\n00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.350\nI just got a free 500 gigabyte.\n\n575\n00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.360\nYou plug it in, autorun goes, you have\nno idea that it's now installing that\n\n576\n00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.600\nmalicious software because\nautorun just did it, right?\n\n577\n00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.820\nCuz that was the setting.\n\n578\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.600\nWe remove that setting,\nat least it will ask them,\n\n579\n00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.300\ndo you want to run this software?\n\n580\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.230\nI wasn't trying to run anything,\nI just wanna look at the files.\n\n581\n00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.221\nSo why does it ask me to run something?\n\n582\n00:28:48.221 --> 00:28:49.880\nMaybe it might make them think.\n\n583\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.734\nAnd if it is autorun anything that's going\non, then you're done, stick a fork in you,\n\n584\n00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.320\nyou've now been infected.\n\n585\n00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.291\nAnd that infection's\nprobably gonna propagate and\n\n586\n00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:01.390\nthe user's none the wiser, right?\n\n587\n00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.500\nSo it's a really good idea to just turn\nthis off, it's just another simple step\n\n588\n00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.180\nthat we can take to try to defend\nagainst attacks such as that.\n\n589\n00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.307\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and you know what, we had\na great question in the chat room and\n\n590\n00:29:12.307 --> 00:29:14.152\nit's one that benefits you on the exam, so\n\n591\n00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:17.453\nI do wanna throw it here in our episode\nand thank you to you viewers out there.\n\n592\n00:29:17.453 --> 00:29:20.720\nAlways gotta give you a shout out\ncuz you're asking great questions.\n\n593\n00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.392\nNow the question came across because I\nam jumping from a client work station to\n\n594\n00:29:24.392 --> 00:29:27.896\na server, it said, you don't think\nthat the CompTIA's gonna have maybe\n\n595\n00:29:27.896 --> 00:29:29.833\na simulation on a Windows Server in A+.\n\n596\n00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:31.900\nAnd my answer is probably not.\n\n597\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.867\nI would say not likely,\ncuz it's not called out on the exam.\n\n598\n00:29:34.867 --> 00:29:37.216\nBut let me show you what\nmight be called out.\n\n599\n00:29:37.216 --> 00:29:40.980\nIn fact, if we go back to my machine here,\nI've been showing you from a centralized\n\n600\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.890\nenvironment doing this\nthrough Active Directory.\n\n601\n00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.490\nThat's why Dan and I have kinda stressed\nthat we're showing you some things that\n\n602\n00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.450\nyou would see in the real world\nas a help desk technician.\n\n603\n00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:52.022\nBut what I think they might do is if I\ndrop down for instance the modern UI or\n\n604\n00:29:52.022 --> 00:29:54.307\nI could drop down to traditional run line,\nand\n\n605\n00:29:54.307 --> 00:29:57.438\nthis is in every Windows operating\nsystem that's on the exam.\n\n606\n00:29:57.438 --> 00:30:00.802\nAnd I could type gpedit.msc and\n\n607\n00:30:00.802 --> 00:30:05.162\nwhen we run that, that brings up you and\n\n608\n00:30:05.162 --> 00:30:09.244\nyou know what I don't have [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n609\n00:30:09.244 --> 00:30:11.900\nYou're not logged in as an admin there-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not logged in as the administrator\n\n610\n00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.240\nso that might be a problem too.\n\n611\n00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.150\nI'll tell you what,\nlet me just go ahead and sign out here.\n\n612\n00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:22.280\nAnd while I'm signing in,\nhopefully [LAUGH] what I believe\n\n613\n00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.660\nthat they will do while they might\nnot have you perform these actions\n\n614\n00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.240\nwithin a server type environment,\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n615\n00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.660\nAgain, I could do this\nfrom the start screen, or\n\n616\n00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.370\nI could do this from the run line,\nagain, kind of jump in there.\n\n617\n00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.900\nNotice it tells me this\ntask will be created with\n\n618\n00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.980\nadministrative privileges\nwhich is really what I want.\n\n619\n00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.709\nAnd I type gpedit.msc, and\n\n620\n00:30:46.709 --> 00:30:51.534\nwhat I can do here is I can configure this\nthrough the local group policy editor,\n\n621\n00:30:51.534 --> 00:30:56.287\nand if you'll notice that the under\ncomputer configuration we're looking at\n\n622\n00:30:56.287 --> 00:31:01.206\nalmost the identical settings, in fact\npretty close to the identical setting.\n\n623\n00:31:01.206 --> 00:31:03.857\nIt's just how it's group together\ninside of the server side,\n\n624\n00:31:03.857 --> 00:31:05.780\nI don't think you have\nto worry about that.\n\n625\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.310\nBut, if you have to set a password policy,\n\n626\n00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:12.480\nif you have to set these account lock out\nthresholds, you're gonna have to know that\n\n627\n00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.480\nyou go into Computer Configuration&gt;Windows\nSettings&gt;Security Settings, and\n\n628\n00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.260\nyou'll have to go under Account Policies,\nand then either Password Policy here,\n\n629\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.487\nand know these settings,\nI would know these settings, right.\n\n630\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.390\nBe aware of them, but\n\n631\n00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:33.470\nthen I would also know where you see\nthings like your lockout policies too.\n\n632\n00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.290\nThat might be something\nthat is definitely,\n\n633\n00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.690\nor could be, called out on the exam.\n\n634\n00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.750\nSo while I don't believe that they're\ngonna have you in a server environment\n\n635\n00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.870\ndoing this, they might have you doing\nit from your local group policy editor.\n\n636\n00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.304\nI also want you to keep in mind\ntoo they might ask you to do this\n\n637\n00:31:47.304 --> 00:31:49.727\nfrom your administrative tools as well.\n\n638\n00:31:49.727 --> 00:31:53.301\nSo let's go ahead again, great\nquestions out there, keep them coming.\n\n639\n00:31:53.301 --> 00:31:56.758\nAnd who knows, your question might just\nshow up in one of the ITPro.TV episodes\n\n640\n00:31:56.758 --> 00:31:59.666\nbecause what benefits you could\nbenefit a lot of other people too.\n\n641\n00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:04.594\nIf I right-click on our Windows tile here,\nwe go to Control Panel&gt;System and\n\n642\n00:32:04.594 --> 00:32:10.100\nSecurity, scroll all the way down,\nwe get into Administrative Tools.\n\n643\n00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.542\nNotice that we have our\nLocal Security Policy, all right.\n\n644\n00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:15.990\nSecpol.msc would launch it.\n\n645\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:22.650\nI'll say that again S-E-C-P-O-L dot\nM-S-C will launch this same exact thing.\n\n646\n00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.600\nAnd if I launch\nthe Local Security Policy here,\n\n647\n00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.670\nI want you all to pay attention if you\nwill to, look at these top two folders.\n\n648\n00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.040\nAll right, notice that these top\ntwo folders have the locks, and\n\n649\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.200\nthey also say Account Policies and\nLocal Policies.\n\n650\n00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.690\nSo if I expand out Local Policies here,\n\n651\n00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.770\nfrom the local security policy\nnotice that, well no excuse me,\n\n652\n00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.350\naccount policy sorry guys, let me get\nthat right side of the river there.\n\n653\n00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:50.740\nNotice that under Account Policies I also\nhave the same exact settings, right?\n\n654\n00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.450\nAnd, if I look over here, I can see all of\nthose settings that we were just talking\n\n655\n00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.510\nabout, but notice that we're setting\nthem from a different location.\n\n656\n00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:02.440\nSo, notice your Local Group Policy Editor,\nknow your Local Security Policy,\n\n657\n00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.630\nand know some of these settings.\n\n658\n00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.250\nThat's why Dan and\nI take the time to show you this, but\n\n659\n00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.110\nwe also give you a little bit more\nbenefit that you can see something that\n\n660\n00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.730\nyou might even be doing as a help desk\nwhere they give you the privileges.\n\n661\n00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:15.490\nThey delegate administration over\na certain account, a certain folder,\n\n662\n00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.300\nif you will, inside of Active Directory\nand allow you to reset the passwords or\n\n663\n00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.360\nunlock accounts.\n\n664\n00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.900\nIt's not uncommon that that might happen.\n\n665\n00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.160\nLast two things I wanna mention.\n\n666\n00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.510\nWe've talked about another episode.\n\n667\n00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:29.450\nDan, I know I've kind of blown the roof\noff of the time clock here on this one,\n\n668\n00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.830\nlast couple of things.\n\n669\n00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.860\nData encryption, remember inside of\nWindows, you're gonna use something like\n\n670\n00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.410\nencrypted file system that we talked\nabout in another episode pretty heavily.\n\n671\n00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.970\nIt allows the owner of a file to encrypt\nit so that only that owner can view it.\n\n672\n00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.100\nAnd then also patch management,\nif you will, and update management.\n\n673\n00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.560\nWe talked pretty extensively about patch\nmanagement and patching systems in other\n\n674\n00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.100\nepisodes as well as using things\nlike Windows Update to make sure\n\n675\n00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.090\nthat security patches are applied\nto your machine on a regular basis.\n\n676\n00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:58.530\nRemember, you can set it and forget it.\n\n677\n00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.580\nIt's not a bad thing, but\n\n678\n00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.590\nalso if you are doing patch management\nyou should be doing patch management as\n\n679\n00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.310\nnormal system maintenance let\nalone preventative maintenance.\n\n680\n00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.280\nYou should also be running,\nwhich they don't call out here\n\n681\n00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.700\nas part of workstation security is\nyour your backup utilities, right.\n\n682\n00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.540\nThat should not be just considered hey or\nwhen I need it.\n\n683\n00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.040\nIt is part of security because of\nthose three letters in the CIA triad,\n\n684\n00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.620\nCIA confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n685\n00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.450\nAvailability's part of security.\n\n686\n00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:31.810\nAnd if the data that I need access to,\nI don't have that available,\n\n687\n00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.080\nthen it runs counter, right,\ncounterproductive to security.\n\n688\n00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.810\nSo even though they don't call them\nout here on the exam, do keep in mind,\n\n689\n00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:41.400\nnot only good patch management, update\nmanagement, but your backups as well.\n\n690\n00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Alright, great stuff, Wes.\n\n691\n00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.480\nThis is my wheelhouse, I love security and\nI love networking, right?\n\n692\n00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.330\nSecurity, that's my two big topics and\n\n693\n00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.770\neverything that Wes has\ntold you is spot on.\n\n694\n00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.780\nYou need to be able to\nfollow these policies,\n\n695\n00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.650\nbest practices,\nespecially I mean, we kind of,\n\n696\n00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.500\nwe've been talking about update\nmanagement, that's a huge one right?\n\n697\n00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.790\nPassword policies.\n\n698\n00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.580\nHuge.\n\n699\n00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.250\nMake sure that you understand exactly\nhow you can work with those and\n\n700\n00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.760\nmake them work to your benefit\ninside of your environment, so\n\n701\n00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.790\nthat you can keep the bad guys at bay.\n\n702\n00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.910\nWes, we do thank you for\nstopping by today.\n\n703\n00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.880\nThank our good audience for\nwatching as well,\n\n704\n00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.800\nbut as you said we're well out of time for\nthis episode,\n\n705\n00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.960\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n706\n00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.720\n&gt;&gt; And I am Wes Bryan.\n\n707\n00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.207\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n708\n00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:32.213\n[MUSIC]\n\n709\n00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:35.594\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.840\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.470\nGreetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.660\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.154\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode it's more in our A+ series\n\n8\n00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:23.430\nthe 220-902 if you're paying attention.\n\n9\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.480\nAnd joining us back in the studio to help\nus pay attention to what we need to know\n\n10\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.970\nto pass that exam,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.830\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.180\nWe're so glad to have you again.\n\n13\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.340\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, thanks for having me here,\n\n14\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.570\nalways great to join you,\nDan, in the ITProTV studio.\n\n15\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.350\nThat's right.\nWe're gonna be looking at securing\n\n16\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.170\nmobile devices.\n\n17\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.800\nNow, in another episode,\nwe talked a little bit about\n\n18\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.430\nsome of the features that you can\nfind within those mobile devices.\n\n19\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.700\nWe talked a little bit about the OS,\ntalked a little bit about the difference\n\n20\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.240\nbetween things like open source, right and\nclosed source or proprietary, right.\n\n21\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.950\nJust different names for\npretty much the same concepts.\n\n22\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.670\nBut in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about a little bit about how\n\n23\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.100\nyou can actually implement\na small bit of security or and\n\n24\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.230\nsome aspects, lot of it is security\nwithin these mobile devices.\n\n25\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.410\nNow, it's important to understand\nthat one of the things that kind of\n\n26\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.210\nseparates mobile devices\nfrom the other computing\n\n27\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.270\ncomponents that we've been talking about\nis the fact that they're mobile, right?\n\n28\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.170\nThe fact that, hey I could turn around,\nand you don't have to ask anybody.\n\n29\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.080\nWell, you could ask\nanybody in this building.\n\n30\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.700\nI can't tell you how many times one of the\nother employees, whether it's a member of\n\n31\n00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810\nour dev team, one of the other hosts,\ncomes up and says, hey Wes.\n\n32\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.540\nThis is your phone right,\ncause I don't know what phone I have,\n\n33\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.672\nit's because I'm always\nleaving it somewhere, right?\n\n34\n00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:35.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there is a reason to have security,\n\n35\n00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:39.519\neven at some basic level security\nimplemented on your devices and\n\n36\n00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:43.865\ndepending on whether that device\nmight be business owned, BYOD,\n\n37\n00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.060\nthat we've talked about right.\n\n38\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.450\nThere's also CYOD, and\nthat's corporately owned device.\n\n39\n00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.610\nNo that's actually CYOD.\n\n40\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.073\nI take that back, it's not corporate owned\non device, that's choose your own device.\n\n41\n00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:58.026\nWhich means your company gives you the\nability to choose which of these devices\n\n42\n00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:59.010\nthat you want.\n\n43\n00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.380\nCorporately owned just means hey,\n\n44\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.340\nwe're gonna give you this device,\nyou don't have a choice, right?\n\n45\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.310\nBut either way, whether it's BYOD and\nyou bring in your device and\n\n46\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.450\nyou're gonna utilize it or whether it's\na company device, there are some times\n\n47\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.840\nwhen you have to go a little bit farther\nthan just some of the basic security and\n\n48\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.030\nyou have to implement\na little bit more security.\n\n49\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.530\nNow, any time we implement security,\n\n50\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.650\nDan I think we've talked about this in our\nother security episodes is that we usually\n\n51\n00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.280\nimplement more than one tactic,\ntechnique, excuse me.\n\n52\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.210\nTechnique, tactic.\n\n53\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.510\nI was [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You can put them together.\n\n54\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.205\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n55\n00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:33.880\n[LAUGH] And\nthat's called a layered defense, right?\n\n56\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.300\nThis isn't anything new right?\n\n57\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.670\nThe The United States military, the\nDepartment of Defense implements this and\n\n58\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.110\nthat's just a defense in depth, right.\n\n59\n00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.828\nSo one of the things I'm gonna want\nare things like passwords on my devices or\n\n60\n00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:46.409\nPINs at the very least, right.\n\n61\n00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.079\nMaybe I'm gonna want to make sure\nthat external devices are removable\n\n62\n00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.190\ndevices, right?\n\n63\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.410\nMaking sure that maybe they're encrypted.\n\n64\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.770\nMaybe I want the entire device to\nbe decrypted or encrypted, right?\n\n65\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.540\nSo, again more than one thing.\n\n66\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.730\nSo those are some of the techniques and\n\n67\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.100\nbasically some of the methods that we're\ngonna look at inside of this episode.\n\n68\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.330\nAll right so ladies and\ngentlemen if you're following along.\n\n69\n00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.200\nLet me take a look at my\nnotes here real quick.\n\n70\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.930\nIf you want the formal definition on this\none, it is going to be 3.5 compare and\n\n71\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.000\ncontrast various methods for\nsecuring mobile devices.\n\n72\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.810\nSo hopefully we can do that\nexact thing here for you.\n\n73\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.750\nNot only to get you prepared for\nthe 220-902 exam, but\n\n74\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.130\nalso, these are some things that you could\ntake away right after you're getting done\n\n75\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.790\nwith this episode.\n\n76\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.430\nMaybe you could pause a video out there,\nand\n\n77\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.700\nyou could actually implement\nthese within your own devices.\n\n78\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.550\nNow, some of them, keep in mind that some\nof the technologies that we're gonna talk\n\n79\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.170\nabout really rely on the the cloud.\n\n80\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.720\nAnd sometimes, even a combination,\n\n81\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.800\nnot only cloud based technologies but\nenterprise level cloud base technology.\n\n82\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.821\nSo there all kinds of free trial accounts\nout there that you can get that you try to\n\n83\n00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:53.845\nimplement some of this stuff and even test\nit within your own infrastructure and\n\n84\n00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:55.550\nset up your own infrastructure.\n\n85\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.527\nBut understand pretty much of the A+ exam,\nwhat they're gonna want you to do is just\n\n86\n00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:02.900\nbe able to recognize some of the concepts\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n87\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.620\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive in with\nreally one of your very first lines of\n\n88\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.590\ndefense when it comes to essentially\nsecurity of your mobile devices, right.\n\n89\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.200\nAnd that's some kind of screen lock,\nright.\n\n90\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.578\nVery minimalistically we want some\nkind of way to make sure that\n\n91\n00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:25.100\nan unauthorized person doesn't\ngain access to your device.\n\n92\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.890\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I heard this is such\na critical thing that they're even\n\n93\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.370\ntalking about making legislature or\n\n94\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.550\nmaybe they already have, pass laws that\nsay you must have a screen lock so\n\n95\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.040\nif your device is stolen, that someone\ncan't just open it up and get into it.\n\n96\n00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Dan, that's interesting.\n\n97\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.880\nWe'll see how that legislation plays out,\n\n98\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.020\nbecause I know there will be some people\nwho say, you don't tell me what to do.\n\n99\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.040\nIt's my device,\nI'll do whatever the heck I want with it.\n\n100\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.880\nSo we'll see how that goes for sure.\n\n101\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and of course there's\nthe whole FBI thing right,\n\n102\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.600\nthey were trying to get into certain\nphones and companies were like nah\n\n103\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.920\nnot doing it so maybe that's what\nthey're playing around with.\n\n104\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.440\n&gt;&gt; I kinda respect that\nwith the companies saying,\n\n105\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.910\nhey you know, whatever the situation is,\nhey we're gonna protect the devices.\n\n106\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.283\nWe gonna honor the privacy of the people.\n\n107\n00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:09.545\nSo one of the very basic things that you\ncan do that they call out that I'll tell\n\n108\n00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:14.137\nyou really isn't security other than maybe\nsecuring yourself from a pocket dial or\n\n109\n00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:18.008\na pocket message which sometimes it\ndoesn't really help me do that and\n\n110\n00:05:18.008 --> 00:05:21.340\nthat's something that's\ncalled the swipe block.\n\n111\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.360\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you what I mean here.\n\n112\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.110\nFor instance, I have on this Android\ndevice that we have here on the right hand\n\n113\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.120\nside, you'll see that it requires, and\nit says right there at the bottom, right.\n\n114\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.130\nIt says swipe the screen to unlock.\n\n115\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.010\nAnd when I swipe the screen\nit does exactly that.\n\n116\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.800\nBut, that really doesn't do much for\nprotecting the device, so\n\n117\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.550\nit really isn't security even though\nthey do kind of put it here in the list.\n\n118\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.000\nNow, there are other\nthings that we can do too,\n\n119\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.805\nwe can do things like passcode locks, so\nfor instance here in the Android device,\n\n120\n00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:59.990\none the things I can do is I can go into\nsettings from one of the screens here.\n\n121\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.500\nWe'll just go ahead and\nlet me move on over.\n\n122\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.540\nI know I kinda did that a little bit fast,\nlet me move into the settings.\n\n123\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.148\nOops, eventually I'll get there.\n\n124\n00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:10.640\n[LAUGH] Move into Settings,\ngo to Lock screen.\n\n125\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.990\nAnd we'll go into screen lock and\nyou'll see that hey,\n\n126\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.260\nthere's a quite a few\ndifferent options here, right.\n\n127\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.000\nWe have what's known as the swipe\nwhich has says no security.\n\n128\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.940\nAnd you can see they have the Face\nunlock which is low security.\n\n129\n00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.930\nNow it's interesting, right.\n\n130\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.820\nYou would think that hey,\nbiometrics type of authentication.\n\n131\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.200\nMan, that should be a really\nreally secured type of thing.\n\n132\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.330\nNot really, not really when you think\nabout it what it's doing is it's using\n\n133\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.690\na picture essentially from\nthe camera that the camera can see.\n\n134\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.380\nWhat's to stop them from saying, hey,\nI'll just take a picture of Wes or\n\n135\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.180\nbecause we have marketing here, right?\n\n136\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.960\nAnd there's a social media out there\nthere's many picture of myself.\n\n137\n00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.800\nSo what's to stop Dan from just\ngrabbing a screenshot and saying,\n\n138\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.680\nokay, I'll just hold it right\nin front of the device,\n\n139\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.880\nand I'll kinda move that around here\nuntil it actually authenticates.\n\n140\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.930\nYou can see that you'll also have,\n\n141\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.580\nwell you have multifactor\nauthentication as well.\n\n142\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.570\nNotice we have Face and voice, right?\n\n143\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.899\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, they are increasing\nthe complexity of the face locking, right,\n\n144\n00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:16.930\nwhere it actually detects if there's heat\nsignature, maybe even depth to the photo.\n\n145\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.620\nSo it's not a photo.\n\n146\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.193\nYou'd have to sculpt\nWes' face out of clay.\n\n147\n00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:23.121\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Put a light bulb inside of it.\n\n148\n00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.355\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, most definitely.\n\n149\n00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.595\nThat's where we're getting into\nthings like Minority Report.\n\n150\n00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:29.725\nBut that's absolutely correct.\n\n151\n00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:32.335\nThey're using the things\nlike the proximity scanner,\n\n152\n00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:34.717\nthe heat and temperature scanner,\nif you will.\n\n153\n00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:37.717\nSo yeah, absolutely, now,\nit's not as easy easy as I say.\n\n154\n00:07:37.717 --> 00:07:38.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:07:39.237 --> 00:07:40.737\n&gt;&gt; To fake it by any means.\n\n156\n00:07:40.737 --> 00:07:44.447\nSo that's a great thing\nthat they're using.\n\n157\n00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:46.837\nSo do keep that in mind as well.\n\n158\n00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:49.427\nAgain we can do it like\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n159\n00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.550\nYou can do pattern recognition.\n\n160\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.910\nThis is also in things like your\nWindows mobile devices too.\n\n161\n00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.220\nThe other thing that we\nsee here on the list.\n\n162\n00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.777\nWe've got Pattern.\nWe also have PIN as well and Password.\n\n163\n00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:04.128\nUnderstand Password's gonna be more than\nfour characters right there with the PIN,\n\n164\n00:08:04.128 --> 00:08:05.670\nthe personal identification number.\n\n165\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.765\nThey say medium to high security but\none of the thing and I tell you what,\n\n166\n00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:13.655\nlet's do the face unlock,\njust gonna show you guys how this works,\n\n167\n00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:16.932\nnotice it says don't use\nthe face unlock while driving,\n\n168\n00:08:16.932 --> 00:08:20.510\nprobably a good idea I would\nsay that's probably good.\n\n169\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.960\nAnd we'll kinda do this and\nwe'll see if it works here and\n\n170\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.830\nI'm gonna kind of continue just spying an\nindoor spot works plenty bright enough and\n\n171\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.440\nwe'll just kinda hold that there for\na second.\n\n172\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.890\nAnd you see that it's turning green there.\n\n173\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.340\nNow it's also gonna probably set up\na multi factor authentication because what\n\n174\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.643\nhappens if well it's a bad hair day.\n\n175\n00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:43.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, which for\n\n176\n00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.500\nme is everyday as you can tell.\n\n177\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.430\nWell it's also gonna ask me to set up a\nPIN, a personal identification number, so\n\n178\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.470\nwe can also show you that as well too.\n\n179\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.980\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nset up one, two, three, four,\n\n180\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.390\nyou know the password to my luggage,\nwe'll go ahead and do that one more time.\n\n181\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.620\nKeep in mind ladies and\ngentleman, I am just joking,\n\n182\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.260\nyou'll want to set up something that\nis a little bit more complex than that.\n\n183\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.780\nObviously but for\nthe purposes of this show and\n\n184\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.060\nwhat's his typing capabilities\nI try to keep it simple right.\n\n185\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.370\n&gt;&gt; Keep it simple sir.\n\n187\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.100\nSo if I close and\nlock the device out like you see and\n\n188\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.990\nI get back into the device, notice that\nit's asking me to look at the camera.\n\n189\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.100\nLook at the camera there for a second,\nit's says I recognized your ugly mug and\n\n190\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.810\nit does let me in.\n\n191\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.660\nSo again, there are some ways\nthat you can unlock your device.\n\n192\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.680\nNow, please understand that\nI'm gonna go ahead and just,\n\n193\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.495\nagain, just for the purposes of our\ndemonstration here, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n194\n00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:40.375\njust kinda disable this for now because\nit does make it a little bit easier for\n\n195\n00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:41.545\nus to kinda demonstrate.\n\n196\n00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:45.365\nNow we can also do this on the iOS too,\nwhich is a great thing, and\n\n197\n00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:47.345\nthis is where Dan was talking about,\n\n198\n00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:51.505\nthe fact that our biometrics on our\ndevices are getting better and better and\n\n199\n00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:55.515\nbetter, and especially with light things\nlike the iPad and stuff, iOS devices.\n\n200\n00:09:55.515 --> 00:10:00.440\nSo if I get back in and I show you guys\nhere, back on the iPad, we can go into\n\n201\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.990\nSettings here, and you'll see that\nthey have this location down here.\n\n202\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.220\nAnd it's not quite in the screen,\nwell, there it is.\n\n203\n00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.690\nNotice we have touch ID and\npasscode, right?\n\n204\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.830\nSo I can get into touch ID and\npasscode, and\n\n205\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.950\nnotice that it is telling me right here,\nwe've got a fingerprint, right?\n\n206\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.170\nAnd I can do an iPad unlock if I want,\nif I wanna use the touch ID.\n\n207\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.260\nIf I've got a mobile payment service,\nlike we've talked about in the features of\n\n208\n00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.750\nyour mobile devices, I can even use it for\nthat as well as iTunes and the App Store.\n\n209\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.730\nNotice that it tells me that I'm\ngonna turn the oasscode on or\n\n210\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.320\nam I gonna use add a fingerprint.\n\n211\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.840\nI'll go ahead and I'll start out\nwith a passcode first, right?\n\n212\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.710\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll enter our passcode.\n\n213\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.370\nIt's telling me that this is\nan easily guessed password\n\n214\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.780\ncuz as you are already recognized-\n&gt;&gt; Wes, it's like of course it\n\n215\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.377\nis that way when I forget it I can\neasily guess it again [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:52.630\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly.\n\n217\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:58.710\nI want to make it sure it's\nas easy as Dan as possible\n\n218\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.830\nto basically get into my iPad here,\nall right.\n\n219\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.250\nSo hopefully that will take a second here.\n\n220\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.390\nWe'll let that set up.\n\n221\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.510\nOnce it sets up let's go ahead and\nwe'll show you how to.\n\n222\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.680\nAnd the finger print, right?\n\n223\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.210\nNow, this is kind of what Daniel was\ntalking about, with like more of\n\n224\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.350\nthe complexities of setting it up, watch\nhow many times this thing goes through\n\n225\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:27.630\nit's diagnostics to basically\nset up your finger print.\n\n226\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:34.380\nI'm doing it multiple times on touching\nthe home screen, all right, and\n\n227\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.370\nnotice that it asking me to place\nmy finger on the home button.\n\n228\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.890\nAnd what's interesting here is I'm\ngonna do this quite a few times until\n\n229\n00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.930\nthe finger print is completely setup.\n\n230\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.120\nBut now what it's gonna do is\nit wants to go even farther.\n\n231\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.500\nIt wants to catch the edges of my finger.\n\n232\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.690\nSo it says basically push\na little bit harder, right?\n\n233\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:02.950\nSo it's trying to ensure that we don't\nhave first of all, false positives.\n\n234\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.610\nRight, false positives mean you're\nauthenticated versus a false negative\n\n235\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.340\nwhich says, I don't know who you are and\nit doesn't let you in to your own device.\n\n236\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.980\nAll right, so now, if I end up pressing my\nlock button here at the top of the iPad.\n\n237\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.250\nAnd let me go ahead and do that.\n\n238\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.230\nAnd I wanna get back into it.\n\n239\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.420\nWell, how could I do this?\n\n240\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.520\nI could press it one time.\n\n241\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.510\nAnd if I wanted I could use the PIN,\nright?\n\n242\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.250\nI could use the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 here and\nI could get in just to authenticate to it.\n\n243\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.190\nLet me go ahead and do that again.\n\n244\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.870\nOr with a single touch,\nI could put my finger on the Home button.\n\n245\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.720\nAnd when I put my finger on the Home\nbutton, what should happen here,\n\n246\n00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:44.040\nlet me wipe that finger sensor off there,\nis that it unlocks for\n\n247\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.130\nit it does look like,\npress the Home button, it's already in.\n\n248\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.490\nLet's see, it happened so quickly, I\ndidn't even know I was hoping I could show\n\n249\n00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:58.700\nyou guys, press Home button to unlock\nthere and there we go and it's unlocked.\n\n250\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.400\nSo that's one of the great\nthings about using\n\n251\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.320\nthings like your fingerprint recognition,\nyour fingerprint lock.\n\n252\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.610\nWe've showed you the face lock and\n\n253\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.650\nthe swipe lock, and\nas well as the pass code lock.\n\n254\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.580\nNow don't let them play semantics\non you on the exam pass code, PIN.\n\n255\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.200\nA lot of times the same number.\n\n256\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.560\nPay attention to the scenario on the exam\nbecause if they say a pass code or\n\n257\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.750\na password is typically more than four\ncharacters they might use pass code and\n\n258\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.230\nPIN interchangeably, and\nthat's typically four characters as well.\n\n259\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.720\nAll right so there are other\nthings that we can do as well.\n\n260\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.110\nI'm gonna go ahead Dan and kind of go off\nthe beaten path here as I always do, and\n\n261\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.050\nI'm gonna skip over.\n\n262\n00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.050\nWe're gonna look at a technology\ncoming up called remote wipe,\n\n263\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.900\nbecause there's a couple of things I\nwant to take care of all at one time.\n\n264\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.270\nSo we'll come back to that one.\n\n265\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.790\nWe're gonna look at locator applications,\nright.\n\n266\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.800\nYou can get these inside\nof your Android devices and\n\n267\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.640\nessentially what it does is it\nallows you to locate the device.\n\n268\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.840\nUse the GPS,\nthe global positioning system,\n\n269\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.150\nto find the locality of the device\nif you happen to lose it.\n\n270\n00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.690\niOS has this built right in.\n\n271\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.450\nThey've had it for a while.\n\n272\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.120\nIt's called find my iPhone.\n\n273\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:12.140\nAnd in fact let me show you here, let me\ngo ahead and we'll look at the iPad here.\n\n274\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:17.710\nI'll swipe over and you'll notice that\nwe do have this find iPhone, right.\n\n275\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.110\nAnd if I log in to find iPhone,\nI'll go ahead.\n\n276\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.460\nI have to have my Cloud based\naccount already set up.\n\n277\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.940\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nI'll get logged into that.\n\n278\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.720\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo that really quick and you'll see that\n\n279\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.370\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna go\nto the process of locating my device.\n\n280\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.971\nNow that happen really quick, I don't\nknow if you see that compass come up but\n\n281\n00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:39.904\nthat came up really quick.\n\n282\n00:14:39.904 --> 00:14:41.286\nIt says, yeah, I know where you're at.\n\n283\n00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:42.237\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Speedy Gonzalez.\n\n284\n00:14:42.237 --> 00:14:42.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n285\n00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.950\nI think it's actually been\ntracking you maybe before.\n\n286\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just because I'm paranoid and\nI think everybody's after me-\n\n287\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.349\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH].\n\n288\n00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:50.313\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't mean they're not.\n\n289\n00:14:50.313 --> 00:14:51.930\n[LAUGH] But notice that it tells me.\n\n290\n00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.020\nOne of the things that it tell me here,\nis it says Turn On Send Last Location, and\n\n291\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.510\nit allows you to find your iPhone.\n\n292\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.960\nIn this case, I'm using it for an iPad.\n\n293\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.140\nSame software, so\nit works across multiple mobile devices.\n\n294\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.750\nWhich is essentially what\nthe episode is about, right?\n\n295\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.380\nThe last known location of this iPad for\n\n296\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.150\nup to 24 hours after\nthe battery has run out, right?\n\n297\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.020\nAnd I can turn that on, and\n\n298\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.560\nnow I see inside of my list here\nthe ability to track this device, right?\n\n299\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.990\nSo, the locator applications\nare a great thing to have.\n\n300\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.500\nNow I will tell you that you\ncan also go a little bit\n\n301\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.370\nfarther than this when it comes\nto remote operations, right?\n\n302\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.230\nAnd you do have the potential to get\n\n303\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:35.810\napplications that will allow you to\ndo things like remote backups, right?\n\n304\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.310\nRemote backup applications.\n\n305\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.180\nThey have them for Android,\nthe third-party applications.\n\n306\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.917\nHowever, they're not built-in to the\ndevice and really, when it comes down to\n\n307\n00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:49.249\nit, if you backup your device up to\niTunes, I say iTunes, it's iCloud.\n\n308\n00:15:49.249 --> 00:15:51.202\nIf you backup your device to iCloud,\n\n309\n00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:54.920\nyou don't really have a way to\ninitiate a remote backup unless you're\n\n310\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.576\nusing some kind of mobile device\nmanagement software, which we will\n\n311\n00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:02.760\nlook at some of the functionality of\nan MDM here coming up within this episode.\n\n312\n00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.950\nAll right, so but\nwe do have to make mention of those.\n\n313\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.900\nOther things and it comes down to\nsecurity that we have to worry about.\n\n314\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.735\nAnd we've also talked about this or\n\n315\n00:16:10.735 --> 00:16:14.230\nwill talk about this I should say\nin our troubleshooting episodes.\n\n316\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.530\nThey talk about basic patch management.\n\n317\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.289\nPatching your systems, right?\n\n318\n00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:19.500\nAnd you wanna make sure that\nyou're doing your updates.\n\n319\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.090\nThese are usually OTAs, right?\n\n320\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.144\nOver-the-air updates\nthat you can download,\n\n321\n00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:24.553\nwhether it is sent from a vendor.\n\n322\n00:16:24.553 --> 00:16:29.000\nBut usually they're vendor-specific and\nit's sent from the carrier.\n\n323\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.173\nSo if you have, for instance, an Android\ndevice that is part of an AT&amp;T network,\n\n324\n00:16:35.173 --> 00:16:39.475\npart of a T-Mobile, Sprint,\nor some of the other ones.\n\n325\n00:16:39.475 --> 00:16:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Verizon.\n\n326\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.680\n&gt;&gt; Verizon.\n\n327\n00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.990\nI just completely mind blanked all\nthe carriers that are out there.\n\n328\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.240\nThey'll typically give you and\npush out OTA updates, right?\n\n329\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.070\nIf you have Google, cuz Google\nmakes their own phone now, right?\n\n330\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.405\nGoogle Pixel, they'll typically update and\npatch the OS at the same time.\n\n331\n00:16:55.405 --> 00:16:58.949\nAnd a lot of times, these fix things\nlike security vulnerabilities,\n\n332\n00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:00.640\nlet alone functionality flaws.\n\n333\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.950\nIf you're gonna do something like that\ninside of your iOS device as well,\n\n334\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.610\nit's really simple.\n\n335\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.100\nLet me go ahead and show you here.\n\n336\n00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.740\nOn our iPad, it's really nothing\nmore than going to your App Store.\n\n337\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.330\nAnd I say the App Store.\n\n338\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.496\nThat's not where it is,\nit's not in the App Store.\n\n339\n00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:20.000\nThat's on your macOS,\nit would be in your App Store.\n\n340\n00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.140\nIt's in Settings, and\nthen look for General, right?\n\n341\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.728\nAnd if you wanna find out if you have the\ncurrent version of your operating system,\n\n342\n00:17:28.728 --> 00:17:30.290\nyou can go to About.\n\n343\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.730\nAnd it tells you a little bit more\nabout what is going on, right?\n\n344\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.360\nAs well as going back to,\n\n345\n00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.910\nif we go back to the general tab,\nwe can go to software update.\n\n346\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.950\nAnd it lets me know basically\nby reaching out to Apple and\n\n347\n00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.030\nsay hey, do you have the current update?\n\n348\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.200\nAnd it's letting me know\nsoftware is up-to-date.\n\n349\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.690\nSo we are good there.\n\n350\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.830\nI did make a slight mistake there.\n\n351\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.970\nAgain, keep in mind cuz I'm used to\nthe Mac OS, I go up to the App Store, and\n\n352\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.370\nI pull down your Mac OS\nupdates from there.\n\n353\n00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:04.210\nInside of iOS, it typically is going\nto be in those general settings\n\n354\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.640\nunder the About menu, as well.\n\n355\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.660\nAll right, so those are a few things\nthat you do have to worry about too.\n\n356\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.410\nThey do talk about things like\nbiometrics authentication.\n\n357\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.460\nWe've shown you a couple of\ndifferent examples of that.\n\n358\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.520\nThe only one I didn't do was the voice\nsignature recognition, right?\n\n359\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.140\nYou can do voice recognition as well and\n\n360\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.740\nyou can see I could set that up in\nthe multi-factor authentication too.\n\n361\n00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.180\nNow you can also setup additional\nmulti-factor authentication as well on\n\n362\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.060\nyour iOS devices.\n\n363\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.030\nIn fact, let me show you how\nto do that here on the iPad.\n\n364\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.390\nSo again, I know I keep going back\nto the home tab basically and\n\n365\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.880\nthen launching you back in the settings.\n\n366\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.680\nIt's just I want you to be very\nfamiliar especially on the exam\n\n367\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.620\nin case they give you a screenshot.\n\n368\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.740\nAnd this one, what we're gonna do\nis we're going to our settings.\n\n369\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.390\nAnd then we're gonna go to up here\nat the top where the name is and\n\n370\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.630\nlet me kind of dive into that so\nyou can see it.\n\n371\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.240\nWe're gonna be right here under\nwhere the name of the iPad is.\n\n372\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.060\nAnd then from here, you'll see\nthat we have Password &amp; Security.\n\n373\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.480\nThat's where we wanna be on this one.\n\n374\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.179\nWe go to Password &amp; Security.\n\n375\n00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:06.990\nYou'll notice it says\nTwo-Factor Authentication.\n\n376\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.460\nEssentially that's where you can set\nup your multi-factor authentication.\n\n377\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.630\nNow you can go a little bit farther than\nthis with multi-factor authentication.\n\n378\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.200\nAnd coming back over to, for instance, my\niOS device, excuse me, my Android device.\n\n379\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.660\nI can use things like\nauthenticator applications as well.\n\n380\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.020\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n381\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.810\nSo if I go down into my app locker her,\n\n382\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.080\nthey do have things like\nyour authentication,\n\n383\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.270\nauthenticator applications, and\nlet me see if I can find it.\n\n384\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.522\nI don't know if I've\nalready downloaded it.\n\n385\n00:19:35.522 --> 00:19:36.280\nI think I did.\n\n386\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.150\nBut we're about to find out and,\nif not, we can go ahead and,\n\n387\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.780\nno, it doesn't look like\nI've downloaded it.\n\n388\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.890\nSo let me go ahead and\ndo that real quick and I'll I show you.\n\n389\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.250\nSo if we go into the Play Store,\n\n390\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.350\none of the things that we can do is I can\nlook for things like Google Authenticator.\n\n391\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.880\nGoogle Authenticator has one and\n\n392\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:59.090\nit allows you to set up a multi-factor\nauthentication, as well.\n\n393\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.740\nSo this is one of those applications and\nit does look like it is installed.\n\n394\n00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.030\nLooks like I missed it there.\n\n395\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:09.000\nAnd again, what it does is it allows you\nto setup these authenticator applications.\n\n396\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.320\nAllow you to setup\nmulti-factor authentication or\n\n397\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.290\nthey are calling it 2-step verification.\n\n398\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.780\nBut basically what it does is it uses\nyour password and it sends a code.\n\n399\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.960\nThat application, right?\n\n400\n00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.463\nIt'll send a code, a temporary code,\nwhat's what we call a one-time password\n\n401\n00:20:22.463 --> 00:20:25.209\nthat you'll have to enter into\nthe account and it'll change.\n\n402\n00:20:25.209 --> 00:20:27.086\nI think it's like every 15 seconds or so.\n\n403\n00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:30.740\nMike, I think you did adjust\nit even more the so than that.\n\n404\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.063\nSo again,\nyou get a little bit more security, right?\n\n405\n00:20:33.063 --> 00:20:36.430\nYou're going a little bit further\nin implementing security.\n\n406\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.350\nAll right, what else do we have here Dan?\n\n407\n00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.920\nLooks like we have well, full device\nencryption that we've got to talk about.\n\n408\n00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.366\nYou gotta be careful with this one\nbecause on iOS or your iOS-based devices.\n\n409\n00:20:48.366 --> 00:20:53.023\nWhat's encrypted really isn't\nfull device encryption,\n\n410\n00:20:53.023 --> 00:20:58.432\nlike it is in Android and even using\nBitLocker in the Windows Mobile.\n\n411\n00:20:58.432 --> 00:21:01.402\nNow I haven't really bragged too much\nabout the Windows Mobile OS, but\n\n412\n00:21:01.402 --> 00:21:03.050\nthat's one of the things that it does.\n\n413\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.770\nIt does BitLocker, so\nit does full-disk encryption.\n\n414\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.060\nAnd the Android devices are good for\nthat, but with the iOS device,\n\n415\n00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.705\nit doesn't necessarily\ndo full-disk encryption.\n\n416\n00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:18.060\nWhat it's doing is it encrypts\nimportant portions of your data\n\n417\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.920\nwhich is always great\nwhen you set a pass code.\n\n418\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.620\nOnce I set a pass code,\nI have data encryption.\n\n419\n00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.840\nOne of the reasons like\nwe've mentioned earlier,\n\n420\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.820\nthat they want you to set pass codes or\nmaybe even make it in legislation\n\n421\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.880\nbecause it does encrypt\nyour important information.\n\n422\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.580\nBut let's be careful because it typically\nisn't true full device encryption.\n\n423\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.570\nLike you could say, so for instance,\n\n424\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.940\nyou can do full device encryption inside\nof your Android operating system.\n\n425\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.899\nIf I go for instance here,\nI can go to, let's see, Settings.\n\n426\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.040\nAll right, and then from Settings here,\n\n427\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.950\nwhat we can do is we can go to, and\nif I remember right that is My Device.\n\n428\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.870\nIs it My Device, no, More.\n\n429\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:04.940\nAnd then Security and then in Security,\nyou can do encrypt your device, right?\n\n430\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.823\nAnd when you do encrypt your device,\n\n431\n00:22:06.823 --> 00:22:11.000\nagain it requires a password to decrypt\nthe phone each time you turn it on.\n\n432\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.001\nAs well as you can see you can see and\ngo a little bit farther too, right?\n\n433\n00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:17.370\nYou can even encrypt anything that might\nbe on your external secure digital card or\n\n434\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.078\nSD card too.\n\n435\n00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:22.340\nSo that's always great to have too,\nkeep in mind in the Windows Mobile\n\n436\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.547\noperating systems too, they also\nhave things like BitLocker to go.\n\n437\n00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:31.676\nAll right, now some of the other things\nyou have to keep in mind is that you might\n\n438\n00:22:31.676 --> 00:22:39.233\nbe required to do things like for\ninstance, Have a policy and\n\n439\n00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:45.454\nprocedure in place that requires\nencryption, requires all these settings.\n\n440\n00:22:45.454 --> 00:22:48.674\nReally requires encryption on your device,\nrequires a password,\n\n441\n00:22:48.674 --> 00:22:52.130\nrequires things like remote wide which\nwe'll get in here in the second.\n\n442\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.700\nUnderstand the policies and procedures\nmight have nothing to do with that.\n\n443\n00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.892\nIt might just be an AUP,\n\n444\n00:22:57.892 --> 00:23:02.188\nwhat we call an acceptable use policy that\nsays if it is a corporately-owned device,\n\n445\n00:23:02.188 --> 00:23:05.248\nthis is how you use it,\nthis is what your responsibility is.\n\n446\n00:23:05.248 --> 00:23:09.855\nThis is what the company's responsibility\nis and this is what is going to happen as\n\n447\n00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:13.750\na breach of security or basically\na violation of that policy as well.\n\n448\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.708\nHow far that goes and how many settings\nthat you might have is really going to\n\n449\n00:23:19.708 --> 00:23:24.715\nbe up to your company and what the\ncompany’s implementation of that may be.\n\n450\n00:23:24.715 --> 00:23:28.399\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun struggle, let me tell\nyou Wes cuz people, they go out and\n\n451\n00:23:28.399 --> 00:23:29.880\nthey buy a device, right?\n\n452\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.887\nAnd they get a plan that they're paying\nfor and then they bring it home and\n\n453\n00:23:32.887 --> 00:23:35.670\nthey go, I want to touch my email,\nand you go yeah, not a problem.\n\n454\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:40.240\nNow if the screen that says if you\nconnect to your company's email,\n\n455\n00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.540\nthey have the right to\nremotely wipe the device.\n\n456\n00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.800\nAnd then you see a lot of consternation on\nfaces because they go what's my device,\n\n457\n00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.880\nhow I'm I giving?\n\n458\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.620\nWell, it's our network,\nyou won't access to it.\n\n459\n00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.218\nThese are things that\nyou're going to agree too.\n\n460\n00:23:54.218 --> 00:23:56.890\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and you're talking\nabout things like HIPAA compliance.\n\n461\n00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.036\nIf you're talking about\npayment card information.\n\n462\n00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:03.750\nIf you're talking about PII or\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n463\n00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.687\nThey also will have protected\nhealthcare information, PHI.\n\n464\n00:24:06.687 --> 00:24:11.060\nAll of this can become something that\nis very, very detrimental of a company.\n\n465\n00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.618\nAnd really company's business continuity,\nif you will,\n\n466\n00:24:14.618 --> 00:24:19.044\nwhen it comes to a violation or\nunauthorized access of that information.\n\n467\n00:24:19.044 --> 00:24:21.652\nNow the other thing we also\nhave to keep in mind is that,\n\n468\n00:24:21.652 --> 00:24:25.077\nwhen it comes to things like permissions,\napplication permissions.\n\n469\n00:24:25.077 --> 00:24:29.443\nEvery application that you download is\ngonna require a certain level of access to\n\n470\n00:24:29.443 --> 00:24:34.259\nyour device, whether it's your data,\nyour contacts, network information, right,\n\n471\n00:24:34.259 --> 00:24:36.170\nlocation information.\n\n472\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.980\nAnd it is important to make\nsure that you're aware of what\n\n473\n00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.570\nthe difference between a trusted\nsource and an untrusted source is.\n\n474\n00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.490\nThese are essentially the app sources,\nwhere do we download from, right?\n\n475\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.350\nWe've talked about the features of keep\nit in mind that you do have things like\n\n476\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.680\nGoogle Play, you have the Store, or Stores\nit's called in the Windows Mobile OS.\n\n477\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.564\nYou have the App Store inside\nof your iOS based devices.\n\n478\n00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:05.120\nYou can potentially download, like for\ninstance in Android from unknown sources.\n\n479\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.010\nHowever keep in mind, there's no real\nrequirement when that happens for\n\n480\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.180\nthe developers to honor what\nthe permissions that they say they require\n\n481\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.860\naccess to your device.\n\n482\n00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.020\nThey don't really have to honor them,\nand there's really no way for\n\n483\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.700\nyou to validate that, unlike something\ngetting them from a trusted sources,\n\n484\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.860\nin which if there some kind of,\nI don't know,\n\n485\n00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.730\nmalicious intent behind it,\nright, you can go to Google and\n\n486\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.285\nyou can submit some kind of claim and\nmake them aware of it.\n\n487\n00:25:32.285 --> 00:25:33.391\nWe'll tell you that.\n\n488\n00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:38.435\nLet's go ahead real quick, and\nlet me show you where you can,\n\n489\n00:25:38.435 --> 00:25:42.606\nfor instance,\ninside of your Android device, for\n\n490\n00:25:42.606 --> 00:25:46.101\ninstance, I can go to Security Settings.\n\n491\n00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:48.452\nAnd if you will,\none of the things I can do.\n\n492\n00:25:48.452 --> 00:25:51.982\nWell, I said Settings,\ngo to basically your device.\n\n493\n00:25:51.982 --> 00:25:56.652\nYou can go to, I should go to More, excuse\nme, we'll get it right there eventually.\n\n494\n00:25:56.652 --> 00:26:01.198\nAnd that's where Security is, and\nnotice that we have this Unknown sources.\n\n495\n00:26:01.198 --> 00:26:03.922\nAnd we've kind of mentioned this a couple\ndifferent spots throughout our mobile\n\n496\n00:26:03.922 --> 00:26:05.860\ndevices that we've talked about.\n\n497\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.020\nAnd I could check that off,\nand if I check that off,\n\n498\n00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.340\nkeep in mind that it gives you warning.\n\n499\n00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.100\nInstalling from unknown sources may be\nharmful to your device and personal data.\n\n500\n00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.050\nBy tapping OK, you agree that\nyou are solely responsible for\n\n501\n00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.150\nany damage to the device.\n\n502\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:23.400\nSo that is something that is\nvery important to keep in mind,\n\n503\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:30.000\nthat if you do this you do run the risk\nof the fact that the application,\n\n504\n00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.700\nyou can't really verify that's it's gonna\nown those permissions that it requires.\n\n505\n00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.130\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about the last thing here.\n\n506\n00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:43.090\nI mentioned a little bit about mobile\ndevice management and then remote wipes,\n\n507\n00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.540\nthat is something that we\nalways have to consider.\n\n508\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.450\nAnd that usually remote wipes\nis gonna come with some\n\n509\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.600\nkind of software that you\nmight be able to download or\n\n510\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.800\nthe third party sense, or\nit might be something that you can do.\n\n511\n00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.707\nI've told you inside of\nan enterprise level environment,\n\n512\n00:26:56.707 --> 00:26:59.391\nthey have what are known as\nmobile device management.\n\n513\n00:26:59.391 --> 00:27:05.278\nAgain, it really depends on how\nyour company has this set up.\n\n514\n00:27:05.278 --> 00:27:07.230\nBut it could be something\nthat you might need.\n\n515\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.280\nSo let me show you\na little bit about this.\n\n516\n00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.640\nI'm gonna go ahead, and what I'll do is,\n\n517\n00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.220\nI'm gonna log into one of the mobile\ndevice management solutions here.\n\n518\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.586\nGo ahead, we've got an error there,\nlet's try that again.\n\n519\n00:27:19.586 --> 00:27:22.750\nAll right, and\nwe'll get there eventually here.\n\n520\n00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.828\nWe'll try one more time,\nbecause Wes knows how to work web browser.\n\n521\n00:27:26.828 --> 00:27:32.579\n[LAUGH] All right, and\nhere's one of our Office 365 page.\n\n522\n00:27:32.579 --> 00:27:34.460\nAnd if I get into the admin console,\n\n523\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.640\none of the things that I\nhave the ability to do.\n\n524\n00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.780\nAgain, with this kind of software,\nand there's different ones out there,\n\n525\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.917\nI just happen to be using Office 365,\nis I have things like the Security and\n\n526\n00:27:45.917 --> 00:27:47.146\nCompliance section.\n\n527\n00:27:47.146 --> 00:27:50.687\nIf I get into Security and Compliance,\n\n528\n00:27:50.687 --> 00:27:56.599\nyou do have a potential to do\ndata loss prevention, DLP, right?\n\n529\n00:27:56.599 --> 00:27:57.967\nAnd Dan was mentioning,\n\n530\n00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:02.413\nthere might be a reason that I might wanna\ndo a remote data wipe, it's in the AUP.\n\n531\n00:28:02.413 --> 00:28:04.205\nIt's in the acceptable use\npolicy that says, hey,\n\n532\n00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:06.664\nif you're gonna use our network,\nyou're gonna use our information.\n\n533\n00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:09.272\nThen at one point,\nif you lose this device or we let you go,\n\n534\n00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:13.056\nas part of the offboarding process, we're\ngonna remotely wipe that information,\n\n535\n00:28:13.056 --> 00:28:15.050\nbecause it's our intellectual property.\n\n536\n00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.610\nWell, this is the platform in\nwhich you could set that up,\n\n537\n00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.850\nprovided you do have things like\nMobile Device Management turned on.\n\n538\n00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.690\nSo if I go in here, for instance,\nin Device Management, right?\n\n539\n00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:32.640\nI can see that Samsung,\nthat this one that we're using right here.\n\n540\n00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.660\nAnd you can notice that over here,\n\n541\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.700\nI do have the ability to do a full wipe of\nthe device or I can do a selective wipe.\n\n542\n00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.463\nAnd this is just from a remote location\nsays, hey, that device is lost or stolen\n\n543\n00:28:43.463 --> 00:28:46.960\nor part of the off boarding process,\nyou're no longer with the company.\n\n544\n00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.583\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ntake our intellectual property,\n\n545\n00:28:49.583 --> 00:28:51.090\nwe're gonna remove it from that device.\n\n546\n00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:56.307\nSo a great security implementation\nto have, just in case something\n\n547\n00:28:56.307 --> 00:29:01.940\nlike that does go on where the device\nitself falls into the wrong hands.\n\n548\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.819\nNow I didn't mention failed\nlogin attempt restrictions.\n\n549\n00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:09.644\nI do wanna just go ahead and\nmention that real quick.\n\n550\n00:29:09.644 --> 00:29:13.890\nAnd let me show you here back in our\nMobile Device Management Solution.\n\n551\n00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.715\nYou do have the ability\nthat what you could do is\n\n552\n00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:20.535\nyou could set up something like\na device security policy, right?\n\n553\n00:29:20.535 --> 00:29:24.335\nAnd in a device security policy,\nI don't have one created here.\n\n554\n00:29:24.335 --> 00:29:26.355\nSo we'll go ahead, and\nwe'll just create one real quick.\n\n555\n00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:29.365\nAnd I'll call this Mobile Devices.\n\n556\n00:29:29.365 --> 00:29:30.945\nWe'll choose Next here.\n\n557\n00:29:30.945 --> 00:29:33.545\nAnd I want you to just kind of run\nthrough some of these settings.\n\n558\n00:29:33.545 --> 00:29:36.020\nSee preventing simple passwords, right?\n\n559\n00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.539\nRequiring a password, right?\n\n560\n00:29:37.539 --> 00:29:39.314\nWe can enforce that.\n\n561\n00:29:39.314 --> 00:29:43.708\nNumber of sign-in failures\nbefore device is wiped, okay?\n\n562\n00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:45.670\nSo that's pretty serious, right?\n\n563\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.670\nNow iPad has that by default.\n\n564\n00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.794\nThey have a lockout threshold and\nyou can't really change it.\n\n565\n00:29:50.794 --> 00:29:55.237\nHere in this aspect, I could change,\nfor instance, the Android and\n\n566\n00:29:55.237 --> 00:29:58.389\nsay, okay, well, you got 15 tries, right?\n\n567\n00:29:58.389 --> 00:30:02.020\nAnd the iOS by default is,\nI think it's 10 tries.\n\n568\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.130\nWe'll look here in a second.\n\n569\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.530\nI can't remember exactly how many tries,\nbut wipe the information.\n\n570\n00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.160\nAll right, lock the device, right?\n\n571\n00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.510\nAnd that, again, would be something like\nyou would have a failed login attempt.\n\n572\n00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.389\nWhat kind of restrictions?\n\n573\n00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:15.783\nHow restrictive do you want it to be?\n\n574\n00:30:15.783 --> 00:30:16.780\nWell, that's up to you.\n\n575\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.906\nRemember, convenience and\nsecurity availability is a part of that.\n\n576\n00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:24.851\nAnd if you say, well, I'll give you five\nattempts and you're gonna wipe the device.\n\n577\n00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:28.015\nWell, Wes probably would have wiped\nboth of these devices in just this 30\n\n578\n00:30:28.015 --> 00:30:28.830\nminutes episode.\n\n579\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's so many types.\n\n580\n00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.371\nYou have to be careful, right?\n\n581\n00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:34.929\n&gt;&gt; You would not survive at my old\ncompany, cuz it was five attempts.\n\n582\n00:30:34.929 --> 00:30:35.788\n&gt;&gt; Was it a five attempts?\n\n583\n00:30:35.788 --> 00:30:37.134\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n584\n00:30:37.134 --> 00:30:42.462\nI realize that this is something\nthat you could be required to do.\n\n585\n00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:43.764\nIf I choose Next in this,\n\n586\n00:30:43.764 --> 00:30:48.168\nyou notice that there are also some other\nthings that we can do, block cloud backup.\n\n587\n00:30:48.168 --> 00:30:53.165\nI might not want anybody connecting\nto external SD cards, right?\n\n588\n00:30:53.165 --> 00:30:54.306\nI might not want that.\n\n589\n00:30:54.306 --> 00:30:55.990\nI might wanna block bluetooth connection.\n\n590\n00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.425\nI might not even want them to access\nthe application store, right?\n\n591\n00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:02.710\nSo I could do that,\nI could create one of these policies.\n\n592\n00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:06.511\nI can enforce it and basically now\nthis device, [LAUGH] it's mine.\n\n593\n00:31:06.511 --> 00:31:11.517\nAs the admin, we could do some\nlevel of controlling over it.\n\n594\n00:31:11.517 --> 00:31:14.239\nNow just when I say that,\nlet me go ahead and close this down.\n\n595\n00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:16.920\nWe'll leave all of this behind here.\n\n596\n00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.750\nAnd let me see if I can\nbroadcast real quick back to,\n\n597\n00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.000\nsometimes it doesn't like,\nit did connect, okay.\n\n598\n00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.130\nReconnect, sometimes it needs me\nto restart the whole application.\n\n599\n00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.590\nLet see if we can show you guys here,\ncuz iPad does this by default.\n\n600\n00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.788\nThere really isn't a lock\nout threshold if you will.\n\n601\n00:31:35.788 --> 00:31:39.544\nYou really gotta be careful here,\nand let me see if I can remember,\n\n602\n00:31:39.544 --> 00:31:40.898\nI think it's privacy.\n\n603\n00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:43.681\nNo, it's not privacy passcode.\n\n604\n00:31:43.681 --> 00:31:46.561\nAnd let me go ahead and\ntype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n605\n00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:50.900\nOkay, so I don't know if you guys can see\nthis, can you see that okay there Dan?\n\n606\n00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.003\n&gt;&gt; Erase all data on iPad\nafter 10 failed in attempts.\n\n607\n00:31:55.003 --> 00:31:56.206\nSo I think that said 15.\n\n608\n00:31:56.206 --> 00:31:57.522\n&gt;&gt; No, it says 10.\n\n609\n00:31:57.522 --> 00:31:59.856\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and data protection is enabled.\n\n610\n00:31:59.856 --> 00:32:02.921\nSo it does have encryption on the device,\nright, like we were talking about.\n\n611\n00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.947\nSo those are some of\nthe things that you can do.\n\n612\n00:32:04.947 --> 00:32:07.740\nThe one thing that I didn't mentioned, and\n\n613\n00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.452\nreally when it comes down to\nit iOS devices don't have it.\n\n614\n00:32:11.452 --> 00:32:14.922\nYour iPads and stuffs as firewalls,\nthey don't have firewalls.\n\n615\n00:32:14.922 --> 00:32:18.910\nAnd in fact you can go into the App Store\nand you can even really find them.\n\n616\n00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.751\nYou can find things like a ways to blocks\ncertain applications, but when it comes\n\n617\n00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:26.098\ndown to it, you're not really doing\nthe true traditional firewall.\n\n618\n00:32:26.098 --> 00:32:29.402\nI will tell you on the other hand,\nhe can go into the Android markets and\n\n619\n00:32:29.402 --> 00:32:32.034\nyou can find them,\nlike no roots one that's out there,\n\n620\n00:32:32.034 --> 00:32:34.162\ndoesn't require obviously, root access.\n\n621\n00:32:34.162 --> 00:32:38.332\nAnd it does monitor traffic, and\nit doesn't allow communications back and\n\n622\n00:32:38.332 --> 00:32:41.669\nforth, depending on whether\nyou're green lighting them.\n\n623\n00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:45.477\nAllowing them or your red flagging\nthem and blocking them, so\n\n624\n00:32:45.477 --> 00:32:50.250\nthe ability to do that is really based\non the operating systems that you have.\n\n625\n00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.200\nWindows, mobile devices,\nthey have a firewall built into them, so\n\n626\n00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.580\nit's kind of built in to\nthe operating systems themselves.\n\n627\n00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.220\nSo just keep in mind,\n\n628\n00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.670\nremember that sometimes when it comes\nto security on your mobile devices,\n\n629\n00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:04.530\nyou wanna make sure that you're at least\nimplementing some form of security.\n\n630\n00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.780\nAnd a lot of times, it's gonna\nmake you a little bit more secure\n\n631\n00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.280\nif you do a layer defense\nsystem if you will.\n\n632\n00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.290\nAnd don't just implement one,\nimplement more than one.\n\n633\n00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.130\nAnd those devices will remain\na little bit more secure.\n\n634\n00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.839\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n635\n00:33:16.839 --> 00:33:21.071\nDefinitely many angles in which we have\nto take a look at when it comes to our\n\n636\n00:33:21.071 --> 00:33:25.782\nsecurity of our mobile devices to go over\nthis list of different angles that Wes has\n\n637\n00:33:25.782 --> 00:33:26.416\nshown us.\n\n638\n00:33:26.416 --> 00:33:29.551\nAnd make sure you're familiar with\neach one, so that you can pass at A+,\n\n639\n00:33:29.551 --> 00:33:32.448\nand keep your mobile device out of\nthe hands of the bad guys, right?\n\n640\n00:33:32.448 --> 00:33:34.906\nSo we wanna keep your data\nsafe just as much as you do.\n\n641\n00:33:34.906 --> 00:33:36.800\nWes, thanks so much for\nteaching us these things.\n\n642\n00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.415\nWe thank our audience for watching,\nbut it does looked like it's time for\n\n643\n00:33:40.415 --> 00:33:41.180\nus to sign off.\n\n644\n00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.473\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n645\n00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:44.487\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n646\n00:33:44.487 --> 00:33:46.680\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n647\n00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.667\n[MUSIC]\n\n648\n00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.371\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:13.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.270\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.470\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.400\nIn today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.500\nit is more in our A+ series continuing\nthat for you good folks out there.\n\n9\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.060\nSo that you can get studied up and\npass that exam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.254\nJoining us back in the studio,\nto lend his expertise on that topic,\n\n11\n00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:30.720\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryant.\n\n12\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.110\nWes, welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.480\nAnd that's right, we are continuing\nalong in that 902 series.\n\n15\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.470\nAnd we've been talking about security\nin the last couple of episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.989\nWell, we're gonna be\ncontinuing on in security,\n\n17\n00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.272\nand one of the things that we're\ntalking about you probably notice\n\n18\n00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:48.153\nby the title of the show is\ndata destruction and disposal.\n\n19\n00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:49.545\nNow when it comes to data destruction,\n\n20\n00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.750\nkeep in mind we're not talking\na Watergate scandal, right?\n\n21\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.120\nOr who knows, maybe we are talking\nabout a Watergate scandal, right?\n\n22\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.360\nBut in all seriousness we're talking about\nmaking sure that company information\n\n23\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.190\ndoesn't end up in the wrong hands.\n\n24\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.968\nNow company information\ndoesn't necessarily just me.\n\n25\n00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:07.320\nThat it's gonna be company employees,\nthat's part of it for sure, but\n\n26\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.360\nit's also things like customer data.\n\n27\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480\nAnd we've got a couple of techniques,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.000\nWe've got a few things that we can\ndo to ensure that the data that's\n\n29\n00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.370\nwithin our information systems\ndoesn't end up in the wrong hands.\n\n30\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.265\nBecause really, I mean,\nwe're talking about computing, right?\n\n31\n00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:26.990\nHere in the A+ we talk about the computing\nindustry for generalization.\n\n32\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.440\nInformation systems old information.\n\n33\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.630\nWe don't want just anybody having\naccess to that information and more so\n\n34\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.090\nwhen we talk about or think about\nthe systems that you have that store\n\n35\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.120\ninformation they have a life span right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.460\nAnd it's not a matter of if these\ndevices are gonna be replaced.\n\n37\n00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.840\nIt's just a matter of when, right?\n\n38\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.510\nAnd we're not even just generally, or\neven talking about things like failure,\n\n39\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.940\nbut failure could be a problem as well,\nright?\n\n40\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.584\nIf a hard drive fails just because\nwe can't access the data through our\n\n41\n00:01:55.584 --> 00:02:00.220\nelectronic means, right doesn't mean that\nsomebody couldn't take that hard drive and\n\n42\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.630\nfind a way into it to\naccess the information.\n\n43\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.160\nSo, we do have to have some steps that we\ntake to make sure that we do things like\n\n44\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.853\ndata standardization, that's one of\nthe main things that they call it right?\n\n45\n00:02:11.853 --> 00:02:16.550\nAnd there are a few techniques that were\ngonna talk about inside of this episode.\n\n46\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.800\n&gt;&gt; What's happening in this\nfield quite a bit of years and\n\n47\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.310\nnow as I'm looking at it on my goodness\nI got a little a little grey in my beard\n\n48\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.180\nfrom when I first started.\n\n49\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.660\nBut one of the ways that we always did,\nI actually started,\n\n50\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.280\nthe first time I destroyed a hard drive,\nwe took a 2 pound hammer, walked it\n\n51\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.278\nout to a concrete wall and just beat\nthe mess out of it like it owed us money.\n\n52\n00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:36.698\nThat's awesome.\n\n53\n00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:40.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I have say physical destruction\n\n54\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.150\nit's one of the best means when it\ncomes to doing data eradication.\n\n55\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.230\nIn fact I've had to do it, I've done\nit for one of our other hosts here.\n\n56\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.060\nOne of our other hosts Don Pezet\nyou've probably seen him.\n\n57\n00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.970\nIf not go check out some of his episodes.\n\n58\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.330\nThe man is absolutely brilliant.\n\n59\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.813\nWell, one of the things he does\nevery time he gets a laptop,\n\n60\n00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:59.380\na new one every six months is\nhe buys a new hard drive, right.\n\n61\n00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.900\nThe hard drives don't have\nenough speed for them and\n\n62\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.970\ndon't have enough capacity, right?\n\n63\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.630\nSo what he does is he\nreplaces the hard drives.\n\n64\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.870\nWell, every time he goes into a new\nlaptop, it's got an old drive, right?\n\n65\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.800\nWell, he actually came to me a few\nmonths ago and I just happened to be\n\n66\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.940\nwanting to show you guys in the 901\nseries a little bit about the drives.\n\n67\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.340\nAnd he says, well,\nI've got all these drives.\n\n68\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.708\nOnce you're done with that dive,\ncan you do me a favor?\n\n69\n00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:28.740\nIf you're gonna make sure that\nthe data's destroyed off of that drive,\n\n70\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.200\nhere's a handful of these drives that I've\nhad, and I've kind gained over the years.\n\n71\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.670\nCan you make sure that\nyou take care of them?\n\n72\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.470\nSo what did I do?\n\n73\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.004\nIt's what Dan said, hammer, right?\n\n74\n00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.469\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, I said this off camera but\n\n75\n00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.022\nI\"m gonna have to say it now.\n\n76\n00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:41.986\nHammertime right.\n\n77\n00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:44.523\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right we're gonna go back.\n\n78\n00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:46.734\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Hammertime while you were hammering.\n\n79\n00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:48.762\n&gt;&gt; Man I even had the parachute\npants as well too,\n\n80\n00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.400\nit's the only way that you can do it.\n\n81\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.330\nBut I want you to understand that\n\n82\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.480\nthe physical destruction with a hammer\nis something that works really well.\n\n83\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.040\nAnd even in laptop drives.\n\n84\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.862\nAnd one of the reasons you gotta\nbe careful with this one though,\n\n85\n00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:05.375\nbecause in the laptop drives, believe\nit or not, the platters aren't metal.\n\n86\n00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.510\nThey have a metal coating,\nthey're actually glass.\n\n87\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.405\nAnd that's what some people\ndon't realize in fact,\n\n88\n00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:12.145\nDan didn't even realize that I said it.\n\n89\n00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:14.530\nWatch this Dan, and\n|I took all the platters out and\n\n90\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.850\nI literally took each one of\nthe laptop drives completely apart.\n\n91\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.820\nSo I had a little saddle drive.\n\n92\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.320\nActually he had a couple that were\nstill parallel to able it or not too.\n\n93\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.898\nAnd I took apart and\nI took the platters out.\n\n94\n00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:27.160\nNow you've gotta be careful with this.\n\n95\n00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.090\nI've done it before, I know how to do it,\nright if I had to do it for\n\n96\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.620\nanother company.\n\n97\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.070\nAnd I wrapped it in tape right?\n\n98\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.830\nAnd I hit it one time, with a hammer,\njust once [SOUND] and it shattered, right.\n\n99\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.111\nI mean millions of pieces which just went\neverywhere and I come back and I said,\n\n100\n00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:44.399\nin a box,\nI'm like here's your laptop latter-age so\n\n101\n00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:46.360\nphysical destruction works great.\n\n102\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.270\nNow, could do something\nthat's maybe not so\n\n103\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.310\nextreme I could just take a drill right,\nyou could kind of drill through, and\n\n104\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.650\nthat's another one that they call out too.\n\n105\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.220\n&gt;&gt; The chat room says\nthermite will do the job.\n\n106\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.350\n&gt;&gt; Thermite is great in fact,\nthermite incinerate's everything,\n\n107\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.730\nin fact it'll go through the box,\nit'll go through the floor.\n\n108\n00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.840\n&gt;&gt; It'll just keep on going.\n\n109\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.700\n&gt;&gt; And you know and interestingly enough\nthat is a valid destruction technique.\n\n110\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.220\nIn fact, we're going to look at some\ncompanies here because we're going to talk\n\n111\n00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.750\nabout some of the things that\nthey mention is incineration.\n\n112\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.250\nWell guess what, there might,\nwill incinerate a drive.\n\n113\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.140\nIt burns right through the drive,\nvery, very hot.\n\n114\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.800\nI've also seen videos of people that say,\n\n115\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.960\nhey I need to get rid of a drive so,\nwhat do they do?\n\n116\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Acetylene torch, melted, right?\n\n117\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.030\nSo incineration is also something\nthat you can do as well.\n\n118\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.350\nNow keep in mind that there are times when\nmaybe you have so many of these drives\n\n119\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.940\nthat maybe you don't wanna have\nto take care of them, right now.\n\n120\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.110\nSomebody like Don handed me four or\nfive drives that he handed me,\n\n121\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.730\nthat's not that big of a deal, right.\n\n122\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.230\nBut Dan, I know you've worked\nin enterprise environments and\n\n123\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.560\nwe talked about this in other episodes\nwhere you're dealing with hundreds\n\n124\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.120\nthousands of computers, right?\n\n125\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.810\nAnd when you get a new\ndeployment of computers,\n\n126\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.230\nwhen a certain batch of computers comes\nto the end of its life cycle you're gonna\n\n127\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.730\nhave potentially thousands of drives,\nright?\n\n128\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.690\nThat's where it starts to\nget a little tricky, right?\n\n129\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.520\nThat's where, are you sure that you've\ncompletely taken care of that drive?\n\n130\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.100\nOr does your company have enough valuable\ninformation potentially on that drive that\n\n131\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.200\nit benefits them to pay another\ncompany that can ensure that data and\n\n132\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.970\nI mean literally not insure and\nensure with\n\n133\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.200\nlicense bonded insure that the data\nitself isn't going to be attainable.\n\n134\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.723\nAll right, now again when we talk about\nphysical destruction of the drive stem,\n\n135\n00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:39.512\nlet's be honest here, when you\nremove the platters out of a drive,\n\n136\n00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:41.390\na lot of time's that's enough.\n\n137\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.350\nAnd when Let me tell you why.\n\n138\n00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.030\nThe moment you open a drive,\nit can start to corrode, right?\n\n139\n00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.350\nIt's one of the reasons they\nput drives together, right?\n\n140\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.630\nAnd they're usually in clean rooms.\n\n141\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.070\nThe other thing too is that every\nsingle drive is balanced, right?\n\n142\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.510\nAnd you'll see that the drives\nhave spacers in between them and\n\n143\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.370\nwhen you remove the platters,\nit's almost next to impossible,\n\n144\n00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.810\nnow I don't wanna say impossible,\nnever say never, right?\n\n145\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.560\nThat's too absolute.\n\n146\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.620\nTo re align them and\nget access to the information.\n\n147\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.250\nBut lets' go back to the concept\nof may be I don't wants.\n\n148\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.740\nI don't want to be responsible for\na thousand drives, so what can I do?\n\n149\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.430\nWell here, let's do that.\n\n150\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.130\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\nlet's do a Google search here.\n\n151\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.490\nAnd there's a couple of things out there,\nin fact thermite was on my list there.\n\n152\n00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.580\nSo thermite data destruction, right?\n\n153\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.640\nSo thanks out there to Jim, as always.\n\n154\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.870\nAnd let's see if there's companies here,\ndata loss made.\n\n155\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.880\nYou know what?\n\n156\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.111\nIn fact, I'm gonna go to another one that\nI know that's out there is Data Killers.\n\n157\n00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.940\nData Killers,\nI believe this is a software.\n\n158\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.107\nThere we go offers certified\ndestruction nationwide.\n\n159\n00:07:50.107 --> 00:07:52.930\nOkay so, this is a type of company, right?\n\n160\n00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.396\nThat you can go to and\nyou can essentially pay them.\n\n161\n00:07:56.396 --> 00:08:00.083\nYou can say, okay I need complete\nincineration of the drives and they will\n\n162\n00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:04.444\nover sometimes come on site all right, and\nthey also have different certifications.\n\n163\n00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:08.672\nBecause of the things that you might\nbe required Required to have is\n\n164\n00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:11.401\na certification of destruction, right?\n\n165\n00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:14.756\nAgain, not that you're certified\nto destroy things, [LAUGH] but\n\n166\n00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:18.843\nthat when they acquiesce, if they grab\nyour hard drives, and they say, okay,\n\n167\n00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:20.930\nwe're gonna destroy them.\n\n168\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.110\nSometimes they even do\nthings like documenting and\n\n169\n00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.410\nshowing you a video of them\ndestroying the devices.\n\n170\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.320\nAnd then they give you this\ncertificate that says, hey,\n\n171\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.600\nyes, here's your certificate\nof destruction and\n\n172\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.730\nwe ensure that, that if this information\nisn't totally gone, guess what?\n\n173\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.160\nYou're not liable for\nit any more, we're liable for it.\n\n174\n00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.080\nAnd that's one of the great things,\n\n175\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.070\nespecially when you're talking\nabout again, hundreds of drives,\n\n176\n00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.810\nthousands of drives.\n\n177\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.040\n&gt;&gt; That's a big claim for them to be able\nto take on that responsibility and say,\n\n178\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.332\nyou go ahead and pass that buck over here.\n\n179\n00:08:49.332 --> 00:08:53.090\nWe will guarantee that this data will\nnever see the light of day ever again.\n\n180\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.620\nThat's a big thing cuz if it does, man,\nthey're gonna be held to the fire.\n\n181\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.858\n[LAUGH] Hopefully not their own\nfire if they're incinerating.\n\n182\n00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:02.231\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can only imagine a place like where\n\n183\n00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:04.850\nyou worked,\nwhere it's an insurance company.\n\n184\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The amount of liability.\n\n185\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.899\n&gt;&gt; We had this big, it was basically\na hydraulic jack with a wedge in it.\n\n186\n00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:14.743\nAnd when you stick drives in there and\npull it down, it would just [SOUND].\n\n187\n00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that would work, that's great for\n\n188\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.278\nlaptop data or whatever.\n\n189\n00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:20.538\nBut for\nsomething that came off that server,\n\n190\n00:09:20.538 --> 00:09:22.450\nthat's going to a company like that.\n\n191\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and these companies that\nyou're talking about also have those\n\n192\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.160\nbig conveyor belts where\nthey do exactly that.\n\n193\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.630\nIf you ever get a chance, go out to\nYouTube and look at data destruction,\n\n194\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.420\nhard drive destruction,\ncomputer recycling.\n\n195\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.690\nQuite literally, they go up a big conveyor\nbelt and they fall down into this,\n\n196\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.040\nit looks like a chipper, but\nit's not a wood chipper, it's literally-\n\n197\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.310\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it eat up a car.\n\n198\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n199\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.395\n&gt;&gt; They drop in a car or a refrigerator\nand it just [NOISE] and it's gone.\n\n200\n00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:47.484\nAnd before you know it,\n\n201\n00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:50.485\nyou got postage stamp sized pieces\nof whatever went down into it.\n\n202\n00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:54.285\nAnd again,\nit's a valid form of data destruction.\n\n203\n00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:57.005\nLet me show you so\nwe're not just using any one person.\n\n204\n00:09:57.005 --> 00:10:01.789\nI've got another one out there\nthat I've also seen before, and\n\n205\n00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:04.991\nthat's Shred 0 is another one out there.\n\n206\n00:10:04.991 --> 00:10:07.310\nLet's see, ShredZero, yeah, here we go.\n\n207\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.740\nData destruction made easy.\n\n208\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.120\nHopefully, their website comes up.\n\n209\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.948\nBut again, just to kinda give you,\nthat you do have options, right?\n\n210\n00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.645\nOr you could go to a place like this that\ndoes secure data destruction, right?\n\n211\n00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:20.470\nThey do things like paper shredding,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:26.301\nPaper shredding is important because\nnotice crosscut papers, right?\n\n213\n00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:32.470\nIn honesty, I could do a paper shredder,\nright, and I could buy a cheap one, right?\n\n214\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.981\nSo I'll tell you what.\n\n215\n00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:35.438\nWe'll take Staples here, right?\n\n216\n00:10:35.438 --> 00:10:39.054\nI can go to Staples and\nI can do paper shredding, right?\n\n217\n00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:43.750\nNotice that this paper shredder here,\nit's got a cross cut, right, and\n\n218\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.193\nit tells you how many cross cuts it is.\n\n219\n00:10:46.193 --> 00:10:50.204\nSo people can't use tape and tape it\nback together, right, or set them side\n\n220\n00:10:50.204 --> 00:10:54.790\nby side and then take a picture and\nbasically retrieve the information.\n\n221\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.533\nBut I want you to notice something.\n\n222\n00:10:56.533 --> 00:10:57.870\nHere's the drawback.\n\n223\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.860\nIn a soho environment these are perfect,\n24 sheets.\n\n224\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:09.153\nLook at this ShredZero,\n8,000 pounds per hour.\n\n225\n00:11:09.153 --> 00:11:10.900\n&gt;&gt; How many sheets are in a pound?\n\n226\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.013\n&gt;&gt; My goodness,\nI couldn't even tell you, right?\n\n227\n00:11:13.013 --> 00:11:16.213\nBut again, if you're talking about\nan enterprise level company,\n\n228\n00:11:16.213 --> 00:11:20.144\nif you're talking about companies the\nsize, the magnitude that Dan's worked for\n\n229\n00:11:20.144 --> 00:11:23.850\nin the past, chances are they've got\nan entire warehouse full of boxes that it\n\n230\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.782\nneeds to be shred.\n\n231\n00:11:24.782 --> 00:11:28.877\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, they'll pull up\nwith this massive truck and\n\n232\n00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:32.817\nit's got a shredding system\nin the box of the box truck.\n\n233\n00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:37.433\nAnd they just start throwing stuff\nin there and it becomes confetti.\n\n234\n00:11:37.433 --> 00:11:38.570\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, in fact,\nwe've got one here.\n\n235\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.767\nThere are multiple companies within\nthe building here that ITProTV has its\n\n236\n00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:43.440\nlocation.\n\n237\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.730\nOne of the companies is\na financial company.\n\n238\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.007\nAnd they have a place that comes every so\noften, and\n\n239\n00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:52.590\nthey literally do exactly what Dan does,\nor said.\n\n240\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.560\nThey have a trash can that's got a locking\nsystem that only their people have access,\n\n241\n00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.470\nwe don't have access to it.\n\n242\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.390\nSo once something goes in there,\n\n243\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.440\nit's not coming out until the people come\non site and they take the trash can out.\n\n244\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.320\nAnd then they shred, and then they give\na certificate, again certificate of\n\n245\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.930\ndestruction, if it is what they call it,\nsometimes just a simple receipt.\n\n246\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.050\nBut they give it back to the financial\ninstitute that says, or institution,\n\n247\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.340\nthat says okay,\nyour data has been completely shredded.\n\n248\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.200\nSo keep in mind that physical\ndestruction is great, right?\n\n249\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.920\nYou can do things like\nthe paper shredders, right, and\n\n250\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.010\nyou can do it on a pretty big volume here.\n\n251\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.090\nYou can do things like,\nagain, incineration, right?\n\n252\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.140\nOop, excuse me there,\nlet me bring that back up, right?\n\n253\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.782\nYou can also do things like,\nthey talk about electronic media as well.\n\n254\n00:12:34.782 --> 00:12:35.994\nYou can do things like\nelectromagnetic degaussing.\n\n255\n00:12:35.994 --> 00:12:37.206\nWhy might I want to pay\nsomebody to do this,\n\n256\n00:12:37.206 --> 00:12:38.599\nto do things like\nelectromagnetic degaussing?\n\n257\n00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:46.840\nLet me show you why.\n\n258\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.093\nAll right, now if I've got Dan's credit\ncard, I'm gonna buy one of these,\n\n259\n00:12:51.093 --> 00:12:52.019\nright, maybe.\n\n260\n00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:53.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna get declined.\n\n261\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.934\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Getting it declined.\n\n262\n00:12:54.934 --> 00:12:56.814\nIt's gonna come back,\nit's gonna say, yeah, right.\n\n263\n00:12:56.814 --> 00:12:57.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n264\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.690\nlet's go shopping for\none of these devices.\n\n265\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.973\nAll right, so\nright there at the top of the list,\n\n266\n00:13:02.973 --> 00:13:04.773\nwe have 105 Hard Drive Degausser.\n\n267\n00:13:04.773 --> 00:13:05.419\n&gt;&gt; You could buy two at that price.\n\n268\n00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:06.202\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n269\n00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:06.987\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n270\n00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:07.840\n&gt;&gt; They're giving them away.\n\n271\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.390\nAnd these are, obviously, very,\nvery good devices, very positive reviews.\n\n272\n00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.525\nAnd again, guys, yeah, I tell you what,\nwe'll give the person credit here,\n\n273\n00:13:16.525 --> 00:13:18.453\nthat this is their product, right?\n\n274\n00:13:18.453 --> 00:13:23.591\nSo here you're talking about\nsomething that even $15,000,\n\n275\n00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:29.814\nright, but it uses electromagnetic waves,\nif you will, to magnetically erase.\n\n276\n00:13:29.814 --> 00:13:31.931\nAnd again,\nthis is more of a physical destruction.\n\n277\n00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:37.487\n&gt;&gt; I had a little one that was\nbasically a square shaped donut\n\n278\n00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:44.220\nthat you passed a drive through a few\ntimes and that was basically it.\n\n279\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.485\nThis is probably a little\nmore powerful than that one.\n\n280\n00:13:46.485 --> 00:13:47.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably, probably.\n\n281\n00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:49.195\nThey're probably telling you that if you\nhave some kind of metal fillings in your\n\n282\n00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:49.735\nmouth, [CROSSTALK].\n\n283\n00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:50.509\nYeah, right.\n\n284\n00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:55.938\nBut yeah, you see that you can say that,\nyeah, you can buy these again,\n\n285\n00:13:55.938 --> 00:14:00.922\nbut it might be beneficial to your\ncompany maybe to just go ahead and\n\n286\n00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:03.792\npay somebody else to do this, right?\n\n287\n00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:08.520\nAnd again, because if it's only gonna\nhappen once every three to five years,\n\n288\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.890\nthree usually at the minimum,\nfive years, I think, is what people like\n\n289\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:18.130\nto get on your return on investment,\nfor any kinda piece of hardware there.\n\n290\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.998\nDrives fail so\nthat might be even shorter than that,\n\n291\n00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:23.350\njust as the way storage medium is, right?\n\n292\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.590\nSo those are things that you can do.\n\n293\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.210\nAgain, keep in mind one of\nthe best ways to sanitize the data\n\n294\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.020\nis to completely destroy the data so\nthat it cannot be removed.\n\n295\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.750\nNow what if you are going\nto recycle the devices?\n\n296\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.537\nGoing into something completely\ndifferent that has nothing to do\n\n297\n00:14:39.537 --> 00:14:40.355\nwith physical destruction.\n\n298\n00:14:40.355 --> 00:14:41.556\nWhat if you're gonna\nactually keep the device?\n\n299\n00:14:41.556 --> 00:14:45.480\nWell, there's other techniques\nthat you have to use, right?\n\n300\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.844\nAnd it doesn't really have to do\nwith this type of destruction here,\n\n301\n00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:51.461\ncuz we're not really\ndestroying the device itself.\n\n302\n00:14:51.461 --> 00:14:54.989\nAll right, because at this point,\nwhen we talk about physical destruction,\n\n303\n00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.876\nwhat we're talking about is,\nwhatever the storage medium is,\n\n304\n00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:00.442\nwhatever the information\nsystem is that you're using,\n\n305\n00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.700\nyou no longer can use that after the fact,\nright?\n\n306\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.950\nObviously, with paper media,\nprinted media, optical disks,\n\n307\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.000\na lot of times, we're not really\nworried about those too much.\n\n308\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.680\nOnce they're destroyed, we never had\nany option to ever use them again.\n\n309\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.560\nWith maybe the exception of\nbeing re-writable disks, but\n\n310\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.190\nagain, whether you use those or\nnot are up to your own company.\n\n311\n00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:29.750\nWe might reuse things like tape\ndrives in order to do backups.\n\n312\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.060\nWell, when you're doing backups,\n\n313\n00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.970\na lot of times, what you're doing\nis an overriding process anyways.\n\n314\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.930\nWhich just means, you're taking\na backup over a backup, right?\n\n315\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.620\nAnd the new data basically\noverrides the old data, right?\n\n316\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.410\nSo that can happen.\n\n317\n00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.500\nBut we're doing that for the purposes,\nlike removable media, to reuse it.\n\n318\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.554\nNow what if you have hard drives that\nhaven't gone past their life cycle,\n\n319\n00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:54.827\nor maybe you're gonna\ndonate them to a school?\n\n320\n00:15:54.827 --> 00:15:59.718\nI worked with a company before that I was\nteaching with and when the computers got\n\n321\n00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:04.536\nnot so powerful enough to do some of the\nthings that we needed to do that we needed\n\n322\n00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:09.281\nto teach them, virtualization,\nmaybe something a little bit more powerful\n\n323\n00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:14.099\nlike CPU intensive like The Adobe suite,\nwell the computers were just fine for\n\n324\n00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:17.610\nsending things like email,\ndoing just basic research.\n\n325\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.090\nSo what the owner would\ndo was he'd take them and\n\n326\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.270\ndonate them to a school, right, why not?\n\n327\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.780\nRight donate them to a school and\n\n328\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.998\nthen now you've saved that school a lot\nof money and they get to reuse them.\n\n329\n00:16:26.998 --> 00:16:29.549\nProblem is,\nthere's still data on those drives, so\n\n330\n00:16:29.549 --> 00:16:33.246\nthat's where recycling techniques come\nin versus a physical destruction.\n\n331\n00:16:33.246 --> 00:16:37.503\nBecause you get the advantage of reusing\nthe device, physical destruction,\n\n332\n00:16:37.503 --> 00:16:39.513\nyou're not gonna reuse the device.\n\n333\n00:16:39.513 --> 00:16:41.672\nRecycling techniques on the other hand,\n\n334\n00:16:41.672 --> 00:16:44.695\nallows you the ability to\nreuse the device, right.\n\n335\n00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:48.185\nIt might be in a situation where\nmaybe you're reusing hard drives,\n\n336\n00:16:48.185 --> 00:16:51.835\nbut you've got new motherboards, maybe\nnew, you know, stronger processors for\n\n337\n00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:54.401\nwhatever reason, but you got a terrabyte\ndrive, and the drive's just fine.\n\n338\n00:16:54.401 --> 00:16:57.457\nWell now we gotta talk about\nthings like format, all right.\n\n339\n00:16:57.457 --> 00:17:00.623\nAnd there's a few different types of\nformats that you have to keep in mind,\n\n340\n00:17:00.623 --> 00:17:01.870\nall right.\n\n341\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.380\nAnd what they call out on the exam,\nthey talk about recycling or\n\n342\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.970\nrepurposing best practices.\n\n343\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.420\nAgain, keep in mind that the goal\nhere is to reuse the device, right.\n\n344\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.610\nSo whether you call it recycling or\nrepurposing the device is still gonna be\n\n345\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:19.480\noperational after you get rid of it or\nit moves to whatever its next purpose is.\n\n346\n00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.370\nSo there's two types of formats, there's\nwhat's known as a low level format and\n\n347\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.930\na high level format.\n\n348\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.370\nNow on your objectives,\nthey call it a low level format and\n\n349\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.710\na standard format, all right.\n\n350\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.930\nLow level formatting, what is that?\n\n351\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.150\nNot something you're gonna do, all right.\n\n352\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.662\nLow level formatting is something that's\ndone by the manufacturer themselves prior\n\n353\n00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:40.723\nto releasing the drives into the public,\nright.\n\n354\n00:17:40.723 --> 00:17:44.943\nAnd what they do is they take the drives\nand they run it through a mechanical test,\n\n355\n00:17:44.943 --> 00:17:45.575\nall right.\n\n356\n00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:49.296\nAnd they basically check every\nsingle sector on the hard drive, or\n\n357\n00:17:49.296 --> 00:17:52.430\nif it happens to be a solid state,\nit's a cell, right.\n\n358\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.840\nMaking sure that the drive is functional,\nbut that happens at the manufacturer.\n\n359\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.760\nThat's not something we do.\n\n360\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.200\nThen there's standard level formatting,\n\n361\n00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.350\nwell they also call it\nhigh level formatting.\n\n362\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.186\nAnd that's what somebody like myself,\nand somebody like Dan can do.\n\n363\n00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.295\nWhat someone like you can do\nat your house, all right.\n\n364\n00:18:09.295 --> 00:18:12.234\nSo, we've talked a lot about things like,\nfor\n\n365\n00:18:12.234 --> 00:18:14.890\ninstance the Windows operating systems.\n\n366\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.570\nWe had the NTFS,\nFAT32 used in all operating systems,\n\n367\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.300\nEXT for\nyour Linux based operating systems.\n\n368\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.400\nWhat do we have?\n\n369\n00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.650\nIn Mac we've go the hierarchical\nfile systems, right.\n\n370\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:31.160\nSo these file systems apply a logical\nstructure to the hard drive, right.\n\n371\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.290\nAnd then we can store our data,\nwell the thing is,\n\n372\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.620\nwe can kind of scramble that\nlogical structure with software.\n\n373\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.450\nThat's the high level formats, so,\nI can do something like a defrag.exe and\n\n374\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.510\nI run the disk defragmenter.\n\n375\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.190\nWhat is it doing?\n\n376\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.840\nWell it's logically arranging your\ndata in continuous blocks, right.\n\n377\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.240\nBut the same thing can go is I\ncan format the drive, and I can\n\n378\n00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.560\napply a file system to it, preparing it so\nthat the operating system can use it.\n\n379\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.860\nIt's a high level format.\n\n380\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.800\nDon't let those terms, again, confuse you.\n\n381\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.910\nWhen I take a hard drive and\n\n382\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:06.340\nI wanna make it operational here in\nWindows, I'm gonna apply NTFS to it.\n\n383\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.190\nI'm essentially formatting the drive,\nI'm doing, whether I do a quick format or\n\n384\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.912\na full format, not so quick format.\n\n385\n00:19:12.912 --> 00:19:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Let's talk\nabout those two differences right.\n\n386\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.980\nWhat's the difference between\na quick format and a full format?\n\n387\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.800\nIf you've ever had to\nprepare a drive with NTFS.\n\n388\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.135\nWell, if you do a quick format,\n\n389\n00:19:24.135 --> 00:19:29.337\nit just says apply the file system\nto it and let's start storing files.\n\n390\n00:19:29.337 --> 00:19:33.437\nIf you do the full format, it actually\ndoes something kinda interesting,\n\n391\n00:19:33.437 --> 00:19:37.729\nit does a check disk, right, in the\nbackground that we can do standard to our,\n\n392\n00:19:37.729 --> 00:19:40.810\nwe can run that utility inside\nof the operating system.\n\n393\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.883\nAnd it literally checks every\nsingle sector along the drive.\n\n394\n00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:47.702\nTakes a little bit longer, all right,\nbut it could ensure that the data or\n\n395\n00:19:47.702 --> 00:19:51.930\nthat the data is stored in sectors\nof the drive that aren't bad.\n\n396\n00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.619\nNow you might say well wait a second Wes,\ndrives that are bad,\n\n397\n00:19:54.619 --> 00:19:56.750\nor sectors that are bad\nwhat do you mean by that?\n\n398\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.200\nWell drives are always falling, all right,\nthe sectors are always failing,\n\n399\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.343\noperating systems are just\nsmart enough to it and\n\n400\n00:20:02.343 --> 00:20:05.235\nthe file systems that they have\nbeing journaled the way they are.\n\n401\n00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:08.590\nThey know how to move files\naround bad sectors, right.\n\n402\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.970\nSo it's kinda interesting that,\nthat happens, all right.\n\n403\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.280\nThat's all high level formatting,\nright, if I run a format in\n\n404\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.540\nthe Windows operating system, and I apply\nNTFS or FAT32, guess what I'm doing?\n\n405\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:26.544\nA high level format, if I'm in Linux and\nI apply something like ext3 or\n\n406\n00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:29.965\n4 to a hard drive, and then we install\nthe Linux operating system on it.\n\n407\n00:20:29.965 --> 00:20:35.095\nWell, that formatting, if you will, that\nwe've done, is the high level formatting.\n\n408\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.530\nNow I mentioned briefly something\nknow as an overwriting, right.\n\n409\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.410\nWhat is overwriting?\n\n410\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.870\nWell, I want you to think about this.\n\n411\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.250\nLet's say that I've just prepared a drive,\nall right.\n\n412\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.480\nWell, maybe I've had a drive\nthat is prepared and\n\n413\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.540\nI've been using it for a while.\n\n414\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.210\nIt's had NTFS on it, right, it's inside\nof the Windows operating system, and\n\n415\n00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.480\nI've been storing information on,\nall right.\n\n416\n00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.338\nI decide that I wanna format the drive,\nI wanna do the high level formatting,\n\n417\n00:20:59.338 --> 00:21:00.443\nwell what have I done?\n\n418\n00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:04.685\nWell, I basically rebuilt\nthe master file tape,\n\n419\n00:21:04.685 --> 00:21:10.248\nI did nothing to the electromagnetic\nlevel of the drive, right.\n\n420\n00:21:10.248 --> 00:21:14.110\nWell I haven't done anything,\nthat data is still there.\n\n421\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.340\nSo, how do we try to sanitize the drives?\n\n422\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.970\nIf we are still gonna reuse them,\nthey have data on them, and\n\n423\n00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.670\nwe format them, but you know that\nthe information's still there.\n\n424\n00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.740\nWell, what you can do,\nI want you to think about it,\n\n425\n00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.570\nis go over to dry erase board,\nand write a word, all right.\n\n426\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.560\nAnd then what I want you to do,\n\n427\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.150\nis write zeros across the top\nof that word in another color.\n\n428\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.020\nAnd then take another color,\nand I want you to write ones.\n\n429\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.110\nAnd then I want you to write zeros,\nand then I want you to write ones and\n\n430\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.470\nI want you to write zeros, right.\n\n431\n00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.349\nSo you do a combination of erasing and\nwriting, erasing and writing and\n\n432\n00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:54.430\nessentially what happens is all you\nare doing is masking the data, right.\n\n433\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.966\nThat's your overwriters,\n\n434\n00:21:55.966 --> 00:21:59.425\nin fact, we got techniques out\nthere that do file overwriting.\n\n435\n00:21:59.425 --> 00:22:03.513\nIn fact, I've actually booted\ninto something known as DBAN, and\n\n436\n00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:07.382\nthis is actually kinda like\na Linux-Live CD or DVD if you will,\n\n437\n00:22:07.382 --> 00:22:09.670\ndepending on what you put it on.\n\n438\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:14.970\nDoesn't really need a DVD but, this is\nalmost like a Linux live operating system.\n\n439\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.670\nAnd what this allows me to do is to do,\nhey, this is what's known as a disk wipe.\n\n440\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.710\nKeep in mind that sometimes\nthose terms are used the same.\n\n441\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.220\nSometimes you might hear\nit scrubbing the drive,\n\n442\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.110\nsometimes you might hear it, overwriting,\nsometimes you might hear disc wipe.\n\n443\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.450\nThere are standards out there, and\nyou don't have to know these standards for\n\n444\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.340\nthe A+ exam.\n\n445\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.610\nI just mention them here, so\nif you guys are out there, guys and\n\n446\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.468\ngals are out there studying,\n\n447\n00:22:39.468 --> 00:22:44.302\nand you wanna find out hey, well what\nthe heck is it if I wanna overwrite data?\n\n448\n00:22:44.302 --> 00:22:46.910\nWell, believe it or not,\nthe Department of Defense,\n\n449\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.740\njust like many other standards\norganizations out there,\n\n450\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:55.370\nlay out standards on what they consider, a\ncompletely overwritten or sanitized drive.\n\n451\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:02.174\nRight, and their standard, just so happens\nto be what's known as DOD, 5220.22-m.\n\n452\n00:23:02.174 --> 00:23:05.970\nPlease do not worry about that for the\nexam, some of the acronyms we talk about,\n\n453\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.590\nabsolutely worry about it,\ndon't worry about this.\n\n454\n00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.593\nThis is just for\nyour own benefit if you wanna read it.\n\n455\n00:23:10.593 --> 00:23:14.460\nAll right, and\nyou can do a series of overwrites, right.\n\n456\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.817\nAnd one of the things that it\ndoes is it writes zeros, right,\n\n457\n00:23:16.817 --> 00:23:19.098\nmakes one pass write zeros to\nevery location on the drive.\n\n458\n00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:22.897\nAnd then reads it back, make sure\nthat those zeroes have been written.\n\n459\n00:23:22.897 --> 00:23:27.098\nAnd then what it does, is it writes ones\nto every location of the drive, right.\n\n460\n00:23:27.098 --> 00:23:28.263\nThat's the second pass, and\n\n461\n00:23:28.263 --> 00:23:30.870\nit reads that information to make\nsure that the ones are there.\n\n462\n00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:36.170\nAnd I believe the last part, I think it's\nthree writes overall in the standard,\n\n463\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.390\nis it writes random characters,\nwell sudo random in computing,\n\n464\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.770\nto every location on the drive, and\nverifies that it can read those back.\n\n465\n00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:49.470\nSo it's just masking the information so\nthat if you do have a computer laboratory,\n\n466\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.400\nessentially what they're saying is with\nthis standard it should be unfeasible.\n\n467\n00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.430\nNot impossible but unfeasible\n\n468\n00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:01.350\nto recover the information after it's\ngone through these type of passes, right.\n\n469\n00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.930\nSo again remember those when you're\nrepurposing your drives, right.\n\n470\n00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.830\nThe best practice says do the high level\nformat, you could start there, right.\n\n471\n00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.680\nBut have an overwriter like this,\nthis is a free piece of software.\n\n472\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.000\nI absolutely love it, it's open source,\nyou don't have to pay for it.\n\n473\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.273\nAnd it will go through and\nit will scrub or do a drive wipe.\n\n474\n00:24:19.273 --> 00:24:22.736\nNow, they don't call out this on the exam,\nbut\n\n475\n00:24:22.736 --> 00:24:28.030\nI do wanna mention your mobile\ndevices also come into play here, too.\n\n476\n00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.770\nThis is more for,\nlike Dan and I have done,\n\n477\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:33.450\nit's not always about what's on the exam\nbut what can benefit you, right.\n\n478\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.419\nWe have plenty of these devices out here\ntoday, right, your mobile devices and\n\n479\n00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:37.009\nyour tablets.\n\n480\n00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:40.614\nI want you to understand that when you\nenrol devices into what's known as\n\n481\n00:24:40.614 --> 00:24:44.635\na mobile device management system,\nMDM based system, you also have enterprise\n\n482\n00:24:44.635 --> 00:24:48.380\nlevel technologies that can do what's\nknown as remote wipes, all right.\n\n483\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.962\nIt isn't in the exam objectives but if\nwe're talking about data destruction and\n\n484\n00:24:51.962 --> 00:24:55.544\ndisposal I don't feel like I'd be doing\nyou any benefit if I didn't just briefly\n\n485\n00:24:55.544 --> 00:24:56.933\nmention that too, all right.\n\n486\n00:24:56.933 --> 00:25:01.658\nSo Dan's the administrator this is\na business company phone Wes has just\n\n487\n00:25:01.658 --> 00:25:03.066\nbeen fired, right.\n\n488\n00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.990\nFor whatever reason, right,\nmaybe I was trying to sing on the job,\n\n489\n00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.130\nand people realized how bad of\na singer I was, and fired me.\n\n490\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.780\nBut I've got company information on this,\nright.\n\n491\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.512\nBut I haven't made it back to the office,\nand\n\n492\n00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.342\nDan thinks that maybe\nI'm gonna do something.\n\n493\n00:25:15.342 --> 00:25:19.314\nI'll be one of the bad actors,\nright, malicious insider.\n\n494\n00:25:19.314 --> 00:25:22.170\nSo what he does, or\nmaybe not even that, right.\n\n495\n00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.270\n&gt;&gt; It's just a precautionary.\n\n496\n00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, absolutely.\n\n497\n00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.850\n&gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with whether or\nnot I think Wes is a bad guy.\n\n498\n00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:27.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, maybe I lost the device.\n\n499\n00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.077\n&gt;&gt; Right, it could have happened,\ngot stolen.\n\n500\n00:25:30.077 --> 00:25:32.761\n&gt;&gt; I took the company phone\nout to the amusement park,\n\n501\n00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:35.827\nand it fell out of my pocket\non the roller coaster, right.\n\n502\n00:25:35.827 --> 00:25:40.091\nI call up Dan and say Dan,\nI need you to erase that drive, right.\n\n503\n00:25:40.091 --> 00:25:42.694\nWell Dan can log into\nthe management system and\n\n504\n00:25:42.694 --> 00:25:47.178\nhe can actually send a command over the\nInternet and wipe the drive completely.\n\n505\n00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:50.803\nSo that is another technology that I\nalso wanted to mention the remote wipe\n\n506\n00:25:50.803 --> 00:25:54.675\ncapabilities cuz it also comes into\nplay with data destruction and disposal.\n\n507\n00:25:54.675 --> 00:25:57.782\n&gt;&gt; All right plenty of ways in\nwhich we can wipe our devices,\n\n508\n00:25:57.782 --> 00:26:00.935\nespecially hard drives specifically for\nthe exam.\n\n509\n00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:03.845\nSo know them, be familiar with them,\nheck, even try some, go grab a hammer.\n\n510\n00:26:03.845 --> 00:26:07.707\nYou haven't lived until you've beaten\na snug out of an old hard drive just go do\n\n511\n00:26:07.707 --> 00:26:08.994\nit a great stress relief,\n\n512\n00:26:08.994 --> 00:26:11.940\nas well as a fantastic way to\nensure your data is protected.\n\n513\n00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.350\nThat being said, Wes, it looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n514\n00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.600\nThanks for joining us again today,\nthank you guys out there for watching.\n\n515\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.760\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n516\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:29.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n517\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.377\n[MUSIC]\n\n518\n00:26:30.377 --> 00:26:32.539\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, welcome\nback to another great episode of ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.660\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820\nin today's episode we're back with more in\nour A plus series specifically the 220902.\n\n7\n00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.510\nIf I'm not mistaken.\n\n8\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.240\nJoining us back in the studio yet again,\nour good friend and mentor, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.810\nWes, welcome back, how's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, this is gonna be\nanother one of those tinfoil hat episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.330\nSo get out your aluminum foil and\nlet's make some hats here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.670\nThat's right, we're gonna be\ntalking about security here.\n\n13\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.070\nMore importantly, we're gonna talk\nabout securing your home networks or\n\n14\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.330\nlike the exam calls out,\nthey call it out the SOHO network, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.140\nThe small office, home office network,\n\n16\n00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.920\nbecause really,\nthey share a lot of similarities, right?\n\n17\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.430\nRelatively small environment,\ndon't have a lot of computers on there,\n\n18\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.750\nusually no more than ten.\n\n19\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.009\nAt least in a Windows world, they call\nthat a workgroup or peer to peer network,\n\n20\n00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:03.614\ncompletely decentralized.\n\n21\n00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:06.388\nA little bit different than\nthe enterprise network, right,\n\n22\n00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:10.284\nwhere we get the centralized experience,\ncentralized administration, right, and\n\n23\n00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:12.600\nwe're typically have\nthe client server network.\n\n24\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570\nSo we're gonna be talking about\nthat in this episode, and\n\n25\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.090\nsome of the things that you can do when it\ncomes to, just methods or procedures for\n\n26\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.680\nsecuring the individual\ncomponents within your network.\n\n27\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.860\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, Wes, you talk about what\na SOHO looks like, and I totally agree.\n\n28\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.170\nThat's exactly what a SOHO is defined as,\nbut\n\n29\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.540\nI've sure as heck seen some people that\nare like, I'm like a full on admin for\n\n30\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.420\na multi-thousand user\nconglomerate corporation.\n\n31\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.468\nI'm gonna have the latest switches and\nspend thousands of dollars or\n\n32\n00:01:40.468 --> 00:01:44.652\nat least try to anyway, or as the budget\nwill allow to build these really\n\n33\n00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:47.123\nsmall networks up like they were bigger.\n\n34\n00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:48.914\nSo it's kind of funny how they do that.\n\n35\n00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:53.836\nBut you can actually go pretty far with\nwhats available for the SOHO environment,\n\n36\n00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:54.344\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:57.916\n&gt;&gt; Really, Ken, a lot of times what\nit comes down to is licensing.\n\n38\n00:01:57.916 --> 00:02:00.499\nEspecially in things, and\nI know you host just a plethora,\n\n39\n00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.421\nI can actually use that\nword once in a while.\n\n40\n00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.123\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n41\n00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dan hosts a lot of different shows in\n\n42\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.290\nhere, and I know you've been in\nmany of the Cisco shows, right?\n\n43\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.540\nWhen they talk about, for instance,\nlike the Cisco ASA firewall, right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.706\nThat's a common SOHO firewall and\nit really boils down to licensing.\n\n45\n00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:19.829\nI think, if I remember right,\nyou get up to 10 users or 10 devices.\n\n46\n00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.694\nNot even users,\n10 devices that you can use an Cisco ASA,\n\n47\n00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:27.479\nyou wanna get up a little bit\nmore than that, go past that,\n\n48\n00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:32.067\nyou're talking anywhere from\n$500,000 here, US dollars.\n\n49\n00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:33.617\nAnd that's, a lot of expense,\n\n50\n00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:36.610\nwhen it comes to one of these\nrelatively small environments.\n\n51\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I used to work with ASAs\nquite a bit, and the tenures\n\n52\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.280\nwere less than agreement, run you a couple\nhundred bucks, $400 or $500 dollars.\n\n53\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.228\nYou want, but\nthen it jumps from ten to 50 and now,\n\n54\n00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:51.516\nthe pocket book needs to come open,\nit's over a thousand bucks after that.\n\n55\n00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:54.750\nIt's really going to cost you some money.\n\n56\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.196\nSo, yeah, if you've got a lot of devices\nthat's the way you're gonna have to go or\n\n57\n00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:00.810\nyou could build a little pfSense,\nit's a whole lot cheaper and\n\n58\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.062\na whole lot easier to manage.\n\n59\n00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:05.584\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm standing next to\nthe wrong guy to start talking about\n\n60\n00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:07.942\nproprietary versus open source, right?\n\n61\n00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:09.855\nOpen source is definitely the way to go,\n\n62\n00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:13.380\nespecially if you're talking\nabout in a smaller environment.\n\n63\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.750\nEven with open source,\npay attention to bells and whistles,\n\n64\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.010\ncuz it doesn't necessarily\nmean everything's free.\n\n65\n00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.990\nSo let's go ahead and let's talk about\nsomething a little more specific.\n\n66\n00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.770\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of interesting\nbecause inside of our exam objectives,\n\n67\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.280\nthey say wireless specific, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.045\nOr like a friend of mine used to say,\npacific.\n\n69\n00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:33.239\n[LAUGH] So when we talk about\nwireless specific, right,\n\n70\n00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.660\n&gt;&gt; That's on the left coast, right?\n\n71\n00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n72\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.244\nSo when we talk about\nwireless networks in general,\n\n73\n00:03:39.244 --> 00:03:41.596\nremember one of the great\nthings about wireless,\n\n74\n00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:45.026\nlike we talked about in other episodes,\nI believe in the 901 series.\n\n75\n00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:47.370\nWe talked about the benefits, right?\n\n76\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.950\nThe benefit is we get unbounded media and\nwhere it isn't just feasible, right?\n\n77\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.940\nMaybe it's not feasible,\nconvenient to knock a hole in a wall.\n\n78\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.850\nMaybe you're in some kind\nof historical building.\n\n79\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.055\nI've seen companies down here, especially,\nwe're in the Gainesville area and\n\n80\n00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:04.090\nas being a former painter,\ncommercial painter.\n\n81\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.330\nThat in certain areas downtown,\n\n82\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.954\nthere are historical buildings\nthat are marked historical, right?\n\n83\n00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:09.975\n&gt;&gt; They don't like you drilling\nholes in those things, Wes.\n\n84\n00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:11.120\n&gt;&gt; Definitely not-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.331\n&gt;&gt; You'll have some people knocking on\n\n86\n00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:12.877\nyour doors, and\n\n87\n00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.230\nit certainly won't be customers\ntrying to buy whatever product it is.\n\n88\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'll be somebody trying to,\n\n89\n00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:20.335\nI don't know, give you some kind\nof audit or whatever, but, so\n\n90\n00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:22.180\nwireless specific is very very common.\n\n91\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.210\nIt's prevalent, right?\n\n92\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.310\nIt's prevalent in our home environments,\nit's prevalent in our SOHO environments,\n\n93\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.220\nand let's be honest,\nin the enterprise environment too.\n\n94\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.580\nSo there are some things when it comes to\nsecurity that we have to keep in mind.\n\n95\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.654\n&gt;&gt; Use the lowest encryption possible,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:39.617\nWell, if you're like me and I'm a hacker.\n\n97\n00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:41.132\nI like seeing that kind of thing.\n\n98\n00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:43.924\nI know I'm just gonna get in.\n\n99\n00:04:43.924 --> 00:04:46.611\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, opportunistic,\nis that how it is?\n\n100\n00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:48.375\nYeah, I tried that one, I don't know.\n\n101\n00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:49.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I actually said that one good.\n\n102\n00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:52.887\nI'm gonna definitely stretch my\nvocabulary about half an inch.\n\n103\n00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:53.854\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That word-a-day\n\n104\n00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:54.526\ncalendar's really paying off.\n\n105\n00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.997\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, that's right, exactly, far side,\n\n106\n00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:58.290\nyou ain't got nothing on me.\n\n107\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.680\nSo you know there are some\ndefault configurations, right.\n\n108\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.810\nWe talk about hardening systems,\nright, and\n\n109\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.907\nit doesn't matter if you're talking about\nwireless, I'm saying wireless specific,\n\n110\n00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:11.041\nbut keep in mind that this really\nisn't just specific to wireless.\n\n111\n00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:15.099\nWe could talk about servers,\nwe could talk about operating systems,\n\n112\n00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.200\ntalking about firewalls, right.\n\n113\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.984\nSteering away from defaults is very,\nvery important,\n\n114\n00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:24.084\nbecause when you first buy a device you\nhave a series of default settings, right.\n\n115\n00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:27.991\nIn other episodes one of the things that\nwe've talked about is something known as\n\n116\n00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:31.209\na security set identifier,\nservice set identifier, excuse me,\n\n117\n00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.120\nI gotta make sure that I get that right.\n\n118\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.530\nThere's an SID in Windows, and\nin wireless we have an SSID and\n\n119\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.280\nthat's the service set identifier,\nright, not just a little 32 bit\n\n120\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.780\nalpha numeric string that identifies\na few things on your network, right?\n\n121\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.330\nOne of the things that it does\nwell identifies the network.\n\n122\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.020\nWe typically just call it a network name,\nand\n\n123\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.680\nif I was to pull out a wireless scanner,\nright?\n\n124\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.260\nEven in this building, right?\n\n125\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.880\nI could find some of the security\nidentifier or security set identifiers\n\n126\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.122\nthat are inside or within\nthe surrounding area, and the problem is\n\n127\n00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:06.069\nwe can have defaults as the security\nidentifiers as service set identifier.\n\n128\n00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get that right eventually.\n\n129\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.945\nWe just came out of our\nWindows software episode and\n\n130\n00:06:09.945 --> 00:06:13.890\nSSID's are talked about a lot there, so\nI'm gonna try to get that one right.\n\n131\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.745\nAnd the things that we have to keep in\nmind is that if you leave things like\n\n132\n00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:21.756\ndefaults, right, default SSIDs,\nthere we go, I had to make it easier.\n\n133\n00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:26.000\n[CROSSTALK] One time the acronym\nactually pays off for me, for sure, and\n\n134\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.994\nthere's defaults, all right.\n\n135\n00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:32.600\nAnd the problem with the defaults, in\nfact, let me go ahead and show you here.\n\n136\n00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.120\nIn fact, I've got wi-fi explorer,\n\n137\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.060\nand this is on the Mac,\nyou guys can use any one that you want.\n\n138\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.460\nThis just happens to be one I have.\n\n139\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.076\nI also have Wireshark in the background,\nthat's a very, very good,\n\n140\n00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:47.589\nyou mentioned Open Source based software,\nright, like pfSense.\n\n141\n00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:52.309\nWell, Wireshark can also show you this,\ntoo, but I want you to notice things,\n\n142\n00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.810\nright?\n\n143\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.000\nWe have SSIDs that are out here and\nwe can find them, right?\n\n144\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.080\nThat's something that you have to keep in\nmind and if you leave the defaults, right?\n\n145\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.800\nSo what's so\nbad about leaving the defaults?\n\n146\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.260\nWell, Dan mentioned hacking, right?\n\n147\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.345\nAnd he definitely has some knowledge and\nsays hey, look, what would you think?\n\n148\n00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.055\nIn fact, I'm gonna throw this one back,\nI'm gonna throw a curveball at Dan here.\n\n149\n00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:13.934\nIf you see a default SSID,\n\n150\n00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:19.045\nwhat do you start to glean about\nthat without just seeing the SSID?\n\n151\n00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:21.195\n&gt;&gt; Well, just by seeing a default SSID,\n\n152\n00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:25.405\nI'm thinking the user that has installed\nthis has very little to probably\n\n153\n00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:29.090\nno knowledge of how systems work or\nhow to secure them.\n\n154\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.073\nSo because they stuck with the default\nSSID, it's a very good possibility that\n\n155\n00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:36.471\nthey also stuck with a default using\na password for logging into it.\n\n156\n00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:39.900\nAnd I'm gonna start hammering\nat that door right there.\n\n157\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.990\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nyou're already gaining some information.\n\n158\n00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.304\nYou didn't have to fire up\nanymore sophisticated techniques,\n\n159\n00:07:46.304 --> 00:07:50.730\nright, just by firing up one\nof these wireless analyzers.\n\n160\n00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.162\nSo default SSIDs,\nwe wanna change them, right?\n\n161\n00:07:53.162 --> 00:07:54.622\nWe wanna make them unique.\n\n162\n00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:58.376\nNow, there's another thing that they also\ntalk about when it comes to the SSIDs\n\n163\n00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:02.034\nhere, and again Just understand that\nthe SSID is really like a network name.\n\n164\n00:08:02.034 --> 00:08:06.930\nNow when I say SSID is a network name,\nit can do other things as well.\n\n165\n00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.005\nIt could show you like the devices\nthat are attached to the network,\n\n166\n00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:12.300\nalso share the SSID.\n\n167\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.230\nIt's how the one of the processes\nyou will have joining the network.\n\n168\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.780\nBut one of the things they\nalso tell you here is to\n\n169\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.320\ndisable the broadcasting an SSID.\n\n170\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.050\nAnd I want you to know that for the exam,\nthat's one of the things that they suggest\n\n171\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:34.530\nthat you do, however, really\nunderstand if I was at my house, right?\n\n172\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.560\nAnd I shut the windows and\nI locked the windows and\n\n173\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.050\nthat's all I do to secure my house.\n\n174\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.460\nHow many robbers do you think\nthat that's really gonna stop?\n\n175\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.380\nIf they really wanna get into my house,\nwill shutting the windows and\n\n176\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.080\nlocking the windows keep them out?\n\n177\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.960\nThe answer is probably not, right?\n\n178\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.260\nSo, a lot of times,\n\n179\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.960\nwhat the SSID does is it keeps\nthe legitimate people out of your network.\n\n180\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.160\nThe people that should be\nthere can't find the network.\n\n181\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.299\nNow, that being said,\nit does do a little obscuring.\n\n182\n00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:04.963\nRight.\nIt's not true security.\n\n183\n00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:07.820\nWe say sometimes security\nthrough obscurity.\n\n184\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.840\nJust makes it a little bit harder\nto find for the average end user.\n\n185\n00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.450\nNow, here's the other thing\nthat you also need to know.\n\n186\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.270\nIf you hide one of these SSIDs that,\nif you're gonna join the network,\n\n187\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.930\nthe people need to know that the network\nis there and they have to make sure that\n\n188\n00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.900\nthey enter the SSID in to the settings\nto be able to join that network, right,\n\n189\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.610\nand that's important, right, so\nif I don't know for instance,\n\n190\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.330\nif I go up here to my wireless\nsettings on my MAC, right.\n\n191\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.170\nI join another network, right,\nbecause maybe it's not in this list.\n\n192\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.680\nSee, my computer is sending these\nlittle what they call station to AP\n\n193\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.720\nprobes out, right?\n\n194\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.779\nIt's sending them out, and\nan access point, wireless action point is,\n\n195\n00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:55.560\naccording to the 802.11 standard is\ntypically configured to respond.\n\n196\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.270\nRight, so let's say that my computer is,\nwhich it's doing right now,\n\n197\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.800\nit's sending out these\nlittle station to AP probes.\n\n198\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.130\nAnd let's say Dan's got\nthe access point over there,\n\n199\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.200\nwell every time I send it out Dan's\naccess point says yeah, I'm over here.\n\n200\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.460\nOkay, send another one out,\nyeah, I'm over here.\n\n201\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.560\nThat's how I'm building this big\nlist here in the background, right.\n\n202\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.360\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n203\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.306\nIf you disable that, right, it just means\nthat you're not broadcasting the SSID.\n\n204\n00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:24.060\nIt can still be found, but\nit's just not being broadcast.\n\n205\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.700\nAnd since it's not being broadcast\nyou'll have to join a network\n\n206\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.450\nby entering manually the network name All\nright now you might say well what's so\n\n207\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.570\nbad about that?\n\n208\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.000\nWell we also have to remember basic\nlevels of security are confidentiality,\n\n209\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.650\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n210\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.870\nRight we say confidentiality.\n\n211\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.960\nWe mentioned encryption in other episodes,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.991\nAnd we'll mention it here too\nbecause it's gonna be important.\n\n213\n00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.600\nIn fact,\nDan's already kinda hinted at it too.\n\n214\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.310\nBut I want you to understand\nthat encryption is important to\n\n215\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.400\nmake sure only authorized people\nhave access to the information.\n\n216\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.279\nIntegrity is where we do\nthings like checksums.\n\n217\n00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:58.757\nJust little mathematical\noperations that say, hey,\n\n218\n00:10:58.757 --> 00:11:00.350\nI'm gonna run it across the data.\n\n219\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.940\nYou check it.\n\n220\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.502\nChecksum if you will.\n\n221\n00:11:01.502 --> 00:11:04.440\nYou check that data with\nthe same algorithm.\n\n222\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.670\nIf they match, we know that it\nhasn't been maliciously modified or\n\n223\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.130\neven modified through network transmission\nfailures, which happen all the time.\n\n224\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.800\nThe last one is availability.\n\n225\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.220\nMaking sure that not\nonly just the authorized\n\n226\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.120\nparties have access to the information,\nbut that it's available.\n\n227\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.100\nSo in disabling SSID, you could kinda\nhinder availability a little bit right?\n\n228\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.030\nBecause of the fact that somebody\nhas to do the manual entry.\n\n229\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.250\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n230\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.440\nNow I know I've kind of talked\nabout that one a little bit but\n\n231\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.690\nunderstand that you need to\nchange the default SSID too.\n\n232\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.000\nAll right, now if you're gonna\nchange the default SSID,\n\n233\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.470\nlet me show you how you would do that.\n\n234\n00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.600\nIn fact,\nwe got a little Linksys router here.\n\n235\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.780\nAll right, the Linksys router here is the,\nyou can see in this one, it happens to be\n\n236\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.863\nan 8350 that we're using right here with\nstock firmware, firmware version 1.0.00.\n\n237\n00:11:55.863 --> 00:11:56.901\nAll right and if I log in,\n\n238\n00:11:56.901 --> 00:12:00.130\nwe'll talk about that log in coming up\nhere cuz that's gonna be another one.\n\n239\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.610\nAnd Dan also,\nalmost I hinted to that one too.\n\n240\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.540\nNow notice that there they talk about\nthis being an advanced utility to change\n\n241\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.890\nyour router settings and\nit could disable your network.\n\n242\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.290\nWe're not going to worry about\nthat warning too much right now.\n\n243\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.680\nIn fact, we'll just kinda click off of it.\n\n244\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.680\nHopefully it'll disappear for me.\n\n245\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.920\nBut I'm gonna go over to\nthe Wireless settings here.\n\n246\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.080\nNotice we have a series of settings.\n\n247\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.530\nNow, understand that most of\nthe wireless interfaces that you get,\n\n248\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.540\nthey're gonna have some similarities.\n\n249\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.372\nThey're gonna be slightly different in for\nthe most part.\n\n250\n00:12:30.372 --> 00:12:34.660\nBut, or for the most part,\nthey're gonna have the same settings but\n\n251\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.440\nthey could visually be\na little bit different, right?\n\n252\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.350\nSo, I'm just gonna look for\na Linksys Wireless, here, right?\n\n253\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.220\nA little webpage here, that we can go to.\n\n254\n00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.300\nAnd I'll go ahead and\n\n255\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.970\nmention this one too, cuz it's in our list\nof wireless-specific, and that's WPS.\n\n256\n00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.810\nNow, and don't let that acronym fool you,\nthat's Wi Fi Protected Setup.\n\n257\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:57.160\nThis in of itself is kind of like\na security vulnerability, it was meant for\n\n258\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.350\nthe average end user that didn't\nknow anything about security or\n\n259\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.700\ndoesn't know anything about security to\nbe able to do a couple of things, right?\n\n260\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.070\nEither to push button security, right,\nwe can push a button on the router,\n\n261\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.240\nwe could push a button on the device,\nthey can communicate if you will.\n\n262\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.140\nEnter a pin and\na little eight digit code if you will.\n\n263\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.330\nThey can communicate together.\n\n264\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:14.840\nThey can talk.\n\n265\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.980\nAnd, they can set up\nthe secure communications.\n\n266\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.135\n&gt;&gt; What can go wrong?\n\n267\n00:13:19.135 --> 00:13:20.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n268\n00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.860\nAnd, one of the things that Dan's\nkind of alluding to here is\n\n269\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.870\nconvenience and security.\n\n270\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.150\nWe talk about this a lot throughout\nthis whole entire series.\n\n271\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.653\nThe more your convenience goes up,\ntypically the security kinda goes down.\n\n272\n00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:36.140\nThe more your security goes up,\nconvenience kinda goes down.\n\n273\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.920\nSo, security really is a fine line.\n\n274\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.662\nI wish I could tell you where that\nline it's an even balance, but\n\n275\n00:13:41.662 --> 00:13:45.210\nthat right there is a whole science in and\nof itself, right?\n\n276\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:51.960\nSo WPS, on a lot of these access points,\nis enabled like you see by default.\n\n277\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.010\nIt's a security vulnerability.\n\n278\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.750\nSo one of the first things I\nwould do is do a manual entry.\n\n279\n00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.660\nAnd then I believe wireless\nsecurity you should see in here,\n\n280\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.780\nand make sure you gotta be\ncareful with some of these here.\n\n281\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.780\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\nwe'll disable this, and\n\n282\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.830\nthen we'll do manual.\n\n283\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.190\nI always check it after the fact too,\nbecause sometimes when you say Disable it.\n\n284\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.020\nWPS is still in the background.\n\n285\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.960\nJust like I did there.\n\n286\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.598\nI changed it from a manual set up\nrather than a Wi-Fi protected setup, so\n\n287\n00:14:22.598 --> 00:14:23.520\ndisable WPS.\n\n288\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.430\nKeep that in mind.\n\n289\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.183\nThat's my best piece of advice,\nthat you can just stay away from it.\n\n290\n00:14:27.183 --> 00:14:29.687\nNow, all right.\n\n291\n00:14:29.687 --> 00:14:31.638\nChanging the default SSID.\n\n292\n00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:33.381\nAll right.\nIf you notice.\n\n293\n00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:35.030\nNotice the network name here.\n\n294\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.060\nAnd we can see Linksys.\n\n295\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.374\nHere's the default SSID.\n\n296\n00:14:38.374 --> 00:14:42.210\nYou can see that it says, underscore 5GHz.\n\n297\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.474\nThat pretty much tells me what\nstandard you're running, as well.\n\n298\n00:14:46.474 --> 00:14:47.820\nSo, if you are Dan, right?\n\n299\n00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.530\nAnd you say, I've got a wireless packet\nsniffer out there, what kind of network,\n\n300\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.300\nwhat kind of standard do I need?\n\n301\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.027\nWell, Dan knows right away that if it is a\nfive gigahertz network, chances are you're\n\n302\n00:14:59.027 --> 00:15:03.559\nrunning the a, at very least it's probably\nnot a anymore because it's so old, but\n\n303\n00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:07.031\nyou're probably running 802.11n or\n802.11ac.\n\n304\n00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.783\nSo now we're starting to understand\nthe hardware that's underneath and\n\n305\n00:15:10.783 --> 00:15:13.020\nall I had to do is to look at an SSID,\nright?\n\n306\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.910\nLet alone like he is saying, and\nwe will get to default usernames and\n\n307\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.020\npasswords, all right.\n\n308\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.810\nSo I just wanna change this, right.\n\n309\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.010\nAnd I might wanna change this to-\n&gt;&gt; FBIV.\n\n310\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.730\n&gt;&gt; He's in my head.\n\n311\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.040\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly where I was going.\n\n312\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.254\nWe've done this before [CROSSTALK].\n\n313\n00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:29.757\nSo we're gonna change this SSID and\n\n314\n00:15:29.757 --> 00:15:32.730\nwe're gonna broadcast something\na little bit different.\n\n315\n00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.910\nNow, again, one of the things that they\nalso tell you is disabling the SSID and\n\n316\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.270\nyou can see that right here that you\ncould do that if you wanted to, right?\n\n317\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.680\nNow, notice your new setting is gonna\ndisable the Wi-Fi Protected Setup.\n\n318\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.370\nUnderstand what I did, if you noticed that\nI said disable and I switch the manual and\n\n319\n00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.053\nit still wasn't turned off.\n\n320\n00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:56.033\nMake sure if you are gonna\ndisable Wi-Fi Protected Setup.\n\n321\n00:15:56.033 --> 00:15:57.367\nLet just go ahead and\n\n322\n00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:03.000\nmake sure Notice that we have disabled\nthe SSID broadcast, all right?\n\n323\n00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.380\nAgain, that's what they say for the exam.\n\n324\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.330\nWe want you to go ahead and\nknow that, but do keep that in mind,\n\n325\n00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.840\nsome of the things that\nwe've talked about.\n\n326\n00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.140\nNow, we can do this on both, right?\n\n327\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.869\nWe can sit here and do this, and again,\n\n328\n00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:21.280\nwe're gonna do FBI band,\ngreat point there.\n\n329\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.315\nNow, there's some others things\nthat you can set here too, and\n\n330\n00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:28.010\nit really goes beyond the scope\nof this exam, really at all.\n\n331\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:33.040\nIt just depends on are you going to\nsupport newer devices, are you going to\n\n332\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.910\nsupport backwards compatibility with older\ndevices, and that's what these modes mean.\n\n333\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.690\nThese modes just mean\n\n334\n00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.960\nwhich of the wireless standards\nare you going to support.\n\n335\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.850\nNow, we have talked\nabout 802.11 standards.\n\n336\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.050\nYou need to know them.\n\n337\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.000\nSo definitely review the technologies\nthat we've already discussed\n\n338\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.160\nhere to know which one you would\nbe using in any given scenario.\n\n339\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.130\nAnd if I disable this one as well, again,\n\n340\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.110\nit's the web page warning me,\n\"Hey, you might not want to do\n\n341\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.450\nthis because you're turning off\nWPS.\" That's what we want to do.\n\n342\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.440\nAll right, now, we've done that.\n\n343\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.160\nWe've changed the default SSID,\n\n344\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.430\nwe've disabled the SSID broadcast,\nwe've kind of mentioned WPS.\n\n345\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.290\nOne of the things that Dan mentioned\nis set your encryption low.\n\n346\n00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.871\nNow, he's joking-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:17.990\n&gt;&gt; -absolutely joking,\n\n348\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.910\nunless you want him to\nget into your network.\n\n349\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.880\nThen he's not kidding anymore, right?\n\n350\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.550\nAnd that's something that we have to also\nworry about too, wireless security, right?\n\n351\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.250\nThis is important.\n\n352\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.238\nSo we can go to wireless security and\n\n353\n00:17:29.238 --> 00:17:32.600\nyou notice I have what's known\nas an open system at this point.\n\n354\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.450\nBecause I disabled WPS.\n\n355\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:40.500\nWPS, it's better than nothing, but\neven at that, I don't like it.\n\n356\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.430\nOnce you disable WPS, unless you go and\n\n357\n00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.550\nset encryption, you've essentially\nturned off encryption on your network.\n\n358\n00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.465\nAnd we don't want to do that.\n\n359\n00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:54.190\nSo, we want to verify what\nlevel of encryption do we want\n\n360\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.790\nwhen it comes to setting the encryption,\nright?\n\n361\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.960\nAnd there's all different choices, right?\n\n362\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.840\nAnd we've talked about some of\nthe specifics of these different protocols\n\n363\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.755\nin other episodes.\n\n364\n00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:05.450\nAs a real quick recap,\n\n365\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.570\npretty much what you want to be\nsetting today is WPA2 Personal.\n\n366\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.450\nAll right,\n\n367\n00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.340\nnow, why do I say personal versus\nwhat you see WPA2 Enterprise, right?\n\n368\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:21.880\nWell, WPA and WPA2, again obviously, WPA2\nis 802.11I, it's the successor to WPA.\n\n369\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.910\nBut they both have the personal\nenterprise implementation.\n\n370\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.545\nPersonal is typically what's\nalso known as a pre-shared key.\n\n371\n00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:30.010\nAnd, Dan, we've mentioned this too.\n\n372\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.360\nDan, I know that PSK bugs\nthe heck out of Dan, right?\n\n373\n00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.440\nBecause, what is it basically?\n\n374\n00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.700\n&gt;&gt; It's basically a password.\n\n375\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.460\nIt's put a password on your network.\n\n376\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.270\nThey call it a pre-shared key.\n\n377\n00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.120\nAnd it makes people go, pre-shared keys,\nthat sounds like encryption.\n\n378\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.520\nYes, it is encryption.\n\n379\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.070\nBut we don't need to be confusing\nespecially people that are new to the game\n\n380\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.580\non what using terminology\nlike pre-shared key-\n\n381\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.450\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n382\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.640\nAnd most of you that are taking\nthe A+ might be new to the game.\n\n383\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we mention it here.\n\n384\n00:18:57.665 --> 00:18:59.505\nIt's just a password, all right?\n\n385\n00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:02.045\nNow, Enterprise goes a little\nbit further than this, right?\n\n386\n00:19:02.045 --> 00:19:06.935\nEnterprise, what this will do\nis this will do an access point\n\n387\n00:19:06.935 --> 00:19:10.425\nthat now will pass\nthe authentication to a server.\n\n388\n00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:12.715\nWe don't have to worry about\nall of that at the A+ level.\n\n389\n00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:15.085\nJust understand that we're not\nin the client server model here,\n\n390\n00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:17.130\nwe're talking about a SOHO environment.\n\n391\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.300\nTypically, the only server that you're\ngonna have inside of a SOHO environment is\n\n392\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.270\na media server, some kind of media server,\nor a file server\n\n393\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.790\nwhere you're just storing your\ninformation, might not even be a server.\n\n394\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.210\nMight, well, I guess a NAS,\n\n395\n00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.390\nis kind of like a technical,\ntechnically a server, if you will.\n\n396\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.250\nBut, we don't have that.\n\n397\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.230\nSo, what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna set WPA Personal.\n\n398\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.850\nKeep in mind,\nyou do not want to be setting,\n\n399\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:43.860\nDan literally was joking when he said set\nit to, lets see if I can get that to work.\n\n400\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.095\nIt's above me there.\n\n401\n00:19:45.095 --> 00:19:46.515\nNo, cancel.\n\n402\n00:19:46.515 --> 00:19:48.270\nAlright, let's try that again.\n\n403\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.870\nThere we go.\n\n404\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.996\nJust a bit outside.\n\n405\n00:19:49.996 --> 00:19:50.530\nBall one.\n\n406\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.180\nAll right.\nSo, WPA, Wi-Fi equivalent privacy.\n\n407\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.960\nNotice that, it keeps telling me that\nit's gonna disable that, and okay.\n\n408\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.040\nAll right, so you don't want to set it to\nWEP, that is a weak encryption cypher,\n\n409\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.961\nso we wanna make sure that we are picking\na Wi-FI personal, WPA to personal.\n\n410\n00:20:05.961 --> 00:20:11.020\nNow [COUGH], I will tell you most\nnewer devices should support WPA2.\n\n411\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.170\nThe only time that you\nmight come into problems\n\n412\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.930\nwith WPA2 is if you have legacy devices.\n\n413\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.740\nNot really common today and\nreally if you have legacy devices,\n\n414\n00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.760\nthem in and of themselves could\nbe security vulnerabilities so\n\n415\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.288\nyou want to upgrade them.\n\n416\n00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:27.980\nBut, we set our encryption and it should\nwarn us a couple of times here that \"Hey,\n\n417\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.150\nyou're disabling WPS,\" but\nwe're okay with that.\n\n418\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.796\nAnd here's the pre-shared key or\nthe passphrase, or\n\n419\n00:20:35.796 --> 00:20:39.610\nmore importantly like Dan said,\nthe password, right?\n\n420\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.220\nSo we just,\nwe put in our super secret password,\n\n421\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.770\nyou know, I Love, I don't know, poodles.\n\n422\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.469\nAnd we'll do a little bit of leet there.\n\n423\n00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:52.510\nIlovep00dl3s.\n\n424\n00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.132\nAll right.\n\n425\n00:20:53.132 --> 00:20:57.172\nNow, obviously this is only gonna\nbe Dan's password and not mine.\n\n426\n00:20:57.172 --> 00:21:01.507\n[LAUGH] But, again, you put in your\npassword, and then you save the settings.\n\n427\n00:21:01.507 --> 00:21:02.130\nAll right?\n\n428\n00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.604\n&gt;&gt; Poodles are a violent dog, by the way.\n\n429\n00:21:03.604 --> 00:21:04.164\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n430\n00:21:04.164 --> 00:21:04.914\n&gt;&gt; Poodles?\n\n431\n00:21:04.914 --> 00:21:05.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:21:05.427 --> 00:21:06.074\n&gt;&gt; They're the standard.\n\n433\n00:21:06.074 --> 00:21:07.568\nThey're used as guard dogs.\n\n434\n00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:11.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually,\nI shouldn't pick on poodles too much.\n\n435\n00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.950\nOur CEO has a poodle and\nhe's actually really cool.\n\n436\n00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.340\nSorry, Tebow, if you're watching there.\n\n437\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Chewie.\n\n438\n00:21:17.073 --> 00:21:17.808\nHe's got Chewie.\n\n439\n00:21:17.808 --> 00:21:20.140\n&gt;&gt; And Chewie, that's right.\n\n440\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.275\nIts been nice knowing you guys.\n\n441\n00:21:21.275 --> 00:21:22.447\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n442\n00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.850\nSo, you can see that we set the passwords\nhere as well and that's important.\n\n443\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.820\nAnd again, don't let the term\npass-phrase or pre-shared key,\n\n444\n00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.440\nit just means that you have to know it and\n\n445\n00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.987\nthe access point has to know it before\nyou can join the network, all right?\n\n446\n00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.535\nNow some of the others things that\nthey- and, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n447\n00:21:37.535 --> 00:21:38.480\ncancel out of this for now.\n\n448\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.270\nBut now you've seen what we could do\nif we where going to change these.\n\n449\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.180\nNow, there are other things that you can\ndo that are a little bit more advanced.\n\n450\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.480\nYou could do things like\nenabling beam forming here.\n\n451\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.690\nAnd they should have, let's see.\n\n452\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.050\nWireless basic settings,\nand I don't see it in here.\n\n453\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.390\nI'm going to go ahead and mention it.\n\n454\n00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.860\nIt doesn't look like\nthis one actually has it.\n\n455\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.830\nLet me go ahead and\njust turn this off, VLAN.\n\n456\n00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.160\nNo.\nI don't really see it on this one.\n\n457\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.281\nSo this one might actually have\na lack thereof beam forming.\n\n458\n00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:13.740\nIt's kind of what you can do.\n\n459\n00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.360\nIt talks about radio power levels.\n\n460\n00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it right there,\nunderneath your mouse, beam forming?\n\n461\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, beam forming there, yeah.\n\n462\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.920\nBeam forming, it's already enabled.\n\n463\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.610\nAnd beam forming is actually\nkind of like a smart antenna.\n\n464\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.720\nJust means that within the cell,\nthe antenna will place itself and\n\n465\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.770\nit will focus it on your location.\n\n466\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.852\nIt's one of the great things about\nmulti-in multi-out implementations\n\n467\n00:22:36.852 --> 00:22:39.712\ninside of the 802.11n and\nbeyond standards.\n\n468\n00:22:39.712 --> 00:22:44.750\nBut, they really talk about peaking and\ntweaking the radio transmit levels, right?\n\n469\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.380\nAnd I know that when you get custom\nfirmware on these like DDWRT,\n\n470\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.250\nyou can really peak and\ntweak the transmit levels, all right?\n\n471\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.210\nYou can do that, yes you can.\n\n472\n00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.600\nBut you really have to know your stuff.\n\n473\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.850\nAnd it's well beyond the scope\nof this exam explaining that.\n\n474\n00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.090\nI mean,\nthey have entire classes dedicated.\n\n475\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.750\nCisco has their own wireless\nimplementations out there and\n\n476\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:09.780\ncertifications on this.\n\n477\n00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.190\nSo it's very, very advanced.\n\n478\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.940\nJust understand that what you're doing\nwhen you start to adjust radio levels\n\n479\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.850\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you're\ngetting a better signal, right?\n\n480\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:19.830\nBecause what happens, right?\n\n481\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.302\nIf I increase the gain on a transmitter,\n\n482\n00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:26.720\nit also increases the potential for\ncrosstalk, right?\n\n483\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.532\nIt just means that I'm\nincreasing the strength.\n\n484\n00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:31.080\nIt doesn't mean I'm increasing\nthe quality of the signal.\n\n485\n00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.450\n&gt;&gt; So really what we're looking at that\nwould be better to do would be placement\n\n486\n00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.700\nof the antennas.\n\n487\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.770\n&gt;&gt; That is a great point.\n\n488\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.030\nAbsolutely.\n\n489\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.190\nMake sure that you're placing\nyour antenna placement.\n\n490\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.590\nAre you using the dipole antennas,\ndirectional antennas.\n\n491\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:49.111\nDo you have a semi-directional antenna,\na omnidirectional antenna?\n\n492\n00:23:49.111 --> 00:23:51.084\nDo you have obstacles in the way?\n\n493\n00:23:51.084 --> 00:23:52.958\nWould be probably the way to go, right?\n\n494\n00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:54.948\nThat's where your bang for your buck is.\n\n495\n00:23:54.948 --> 00:23:59.343\nAnd honestly It's so easy today\nto get wireless range extenders.\n\n496\n00:23:59.343 --> 00:24:02.649\nRather than messing with the power levels,\nthe radio levels within\n\n497\n00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:06.790\nthe transmitters within the access point,\njust put in a wireless range extender.\n\n498\n00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.882\nThey're not very expensive, right?\n\n499\n00:24:07.882 --> 00:24:11.598\nWe're not talking about the late\n90s when this technology first\n\n500\n00:24:11.598 --> 00:24:15.370\ncame out where a single access\npoint could cost you a grand.\n\n501\n00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:19.120\nRight now, we're talking they've\nreally come down in price.\n\n502\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.260\nAll right, now Dan,\nyou also mentioned another thing, and\n\n503\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.170\nthat's changing the default username and\npassword.\n\n504\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.789\nWell actually, the lack there of, right?\n\n505\n00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:30.810\nIf you start to do some fingerprinting\nhere, hey, you got that default SSID.\n\n506\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.230\nChances are, you probably have\nthe default user name and\n\n507\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.346\npassword for your access point.\n\n508\n00:24:36.346 --> 00:24:41.130\nSo if I can show you here too,\nnotice that we have administration and\n\n509\n00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.150\nwe have the ability to\nchange that password.\n\n510\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.060\nYou wanna change the password, right?\n\n511\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.985\nAnd the reason I say that is because\nsometimes you can't change the username,\n\n512\n00:24:49.985 --> 00:24:51.006\nsometimes you can.\n\n513\n00:24:51.006 --> 00:24:54.210\nSometimes, you can change the router name,\nif you will.\n\n514\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.050\nPay attention to level of\nwhat you can change and\n\n515\n00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.620\nwhat you can't change, all right?\n\n516\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.327\nBut you wanna stay away from\nthe default user name and password.\n\n517\n00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:04.175\nLet me show you why here.\n\n518\n00:25:04.175 --> 00:25:09.558\nSo in the background,\nwhat I'm gonna do is type,\n\n519\n00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:14.440\nwhat is it,\ndefault user name and password.\n\n520\n00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.190\nAnd what did I say, Dan?\n\n521\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.900\nWe're E8350, I believe is what it was,\n8350 I think.\n\n522\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.028\nAll right, and wait, yeah,\nright there, right, links us.\n\n523\n00:25:24.028 --> 00:25:28.670\n[LAUGH] The manufacturer told me how\nto get into their access points, right?\n\n524\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.852\nI like how it comes right up.\n\n525\n00:25:29.852 --> 00:25:31.062\nYou don't even have to click a link.\n\n526\n00:25:31.062 --> 00:25:32.820\n&gt;&gt; You just go to Google and type it in.\n\n527\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.660\nAnd then the first thing that\nshows up is the username is blank.\n\n528\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.770\nThe password is admin.\n\n529\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n530\n00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.010\nSo we have to be careful with that one.\n\n531\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.192\nAnd that's why earlier,\nDan was saying that hey,\n\n532\n00:25:42.192 --> 00:25:45.608\nif you've got a user that\nmaybe wasn't savvy enough.\n\n533\n00:25:45.608 --> 00:25:47.944\nI don't wanna say smart enough cuz it\nhas nothing to do with their level of\n\n534\n00:25:47.944 --> 00:25:48.490\nintelligence.\n\n535\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.190\nIt's the level of experience, if you will.\n\n536\n00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.200\nBut if a user isn't technically\nsavvy enough to sit there and\n\n537\n00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.770\nchange the default SSID,\n\n538\n00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:00.190\nthe chances are they're probably logging\nin with a default user name and password.\n\n539\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.410\nAnd now we can get into the access point.\n\n540\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.140\nSo be careful with that, and that's one of\nthe things that I did wanna show you here.\n\n541\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.732\nNow some of the other things here, and\n\n542\n00:26:08.732 --> 00:26:13.550\nI know we're kinda running up on\ntime here, that you can do is.\n\n543\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.600\nFor instance, some of the other things\nthat you can do when it comes to security,\n\n544\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.105\nand let's see, the firewall, right?\n\n545\n00:26:19.105 --> 00:26:22.400\nMaking sure that you have your\nfirewalls turned on, right?\n\n546\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.422\nOne of the things that I like\nabout in the Linksys series, and\n\n547\n00:26:25.422 --> 00:26:27.505\nI know that the other one Belkin has this.\n\n548\n00:26:27.505 --> 00:26:29.615\nWhat is it, Dlink, TPlink,\n\n549\n00:26:29.615 --> 00:26:33.495\nsome of the other ones out there have SPI,\nstateful packet inspection.\n\n550\n00:26:33.495 --> 00:26:36.525\nWe can look at that, well, a firewall\ncan look at that information and\n\n551\n00:26:36.525 --> 00:26:40.930\nsay yeah, that's not HTTP traffic, I don't\ncare if it's coming over port 80 or not.\n\n552\n00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.070\nThat has nothing, so\nthey can really look at the information.\n\n553\n00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.488\nAgain, filtering anonymous\nInternet requests out there,\n\n554\n00:26:48.488 --> 00:26:51.442\npeople sending out ICMP echo requests.\n\n555\n00:26:51.442 --> 00:26:54.641\nThey wanna ping the internet\nside of your access point.\n\n556\n00:26:54.641 --> 00:26:59.089\nAgain, filtering that out,\nyou can also do web filtering, too,\n\n557\n00:26:59.089 --> 00:27:01.665\nwhich can help do content filtering.\n\n558\n00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:07.130\nLikewise you might have the ability to\ndo parental filtering too, as well.\n\n559\n00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:12.060\nYou can do, if I remember right,\nyou can have access policies too.\n\n560\n00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.370\nSo notice your parental controls here too.\n\n561\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.640\nSo there's our parental controls,\nwe can enable them.\n\n562\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:22.590\nWe can say, hey, restrict Internet\naccess on my son's tablet, right?\n\n563\n00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.472\nMaybe I don't want him accessing it or\nmaybe I say, yes,\n\n564\n00:27:25.472 --> 00:27:27.285\nyou can access it within this hour.\n\n565\n00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:29.130\nBecause I know he's doing school work,\nright?\n\n566\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.797\nSo within that hour, I want him to be able\nto access the Internet or not, right?\n\n567\n00:27:33.797 --> 00:27:37.844\nAnd again, blocking specific sites is\nsometimes called URL filtering, but\n\n568\n00:27:37.844 --> 00:27:40.719\nsometimes, they mix that\ncontent filtering as well.\n\n569\n00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:44.844\nI would say content is probably\na little bit closer to,\n\n570\n00:27:44.844 --> 00:27:50.390\nwe're gonna go to security, content\nfiltering is more like a web filter here.\n\n571\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.167\nNotice what they're\nfiltering specifically to.\n\n572\n00:27:54.167 --> 00:27:56.241\nAll right, so one of the other things too,\n\n573\n00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:58.900\nnow this is another thing\nthat they talk about as well.\n\n574\n00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.027\nLet's go to setup, and\noops, I'll click setup.\n\n575\n00:28:03.027 --> 00:28:04.770\nHopefully that will work.\n\n576\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.684\nI doubt I'll be able to\nreally truly disable that.\n\n577\n00:28:07.684 --> 00:28:10.214\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice the other thing that they talk\n\n578\n00:28:10.214 --> 00:28:12.900\nabout is IP address and\nthe IP address of the router.\n\n579\n00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.730\nThey also talk about DHCP server settings,\nand they also mention to disable this.\n\n580\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.760\nBe careful with this, all right?\n\n581\n00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.280\nWe were kinda hinting on convenience and\nsecurity.\n\n582\n00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.710\nDoes this increase security?\n\n583\n00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.730\nYes, it does, that's right.\n\n584\n00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.190\nBecause guess what?\n\n585\n00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.970\nMy access point isn't calling out to\nthe local network and saying, hey,\n\n586\n00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.590\nyeah, I got an IP address for\nanybody that asks.\n\n587\n00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.236\nHere's the problem, it doesn't have\nan IP address for anybody that asks.\n\n588\n00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:42.465\nAnd what you're doing is you would have to\nmanually configure every IP address for\n\n589\n00:28:42.465 --> 00:28:45.736\nevery device that wants to\nattach to your network.\n\n590\n00:28:45.736 --> 00:28:50.090\nAnd again, if you have devices that aren't\nleaving your network, that's just fine.\n\n591\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.341\nBut what if you have people\nthat have cellphones, and\n\n592\n00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:54.450\nwhat happens if that cellphone changes,\nright?\n\n593\n00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.634\nI say cellphones because they\nconnect to the wireless network,\n\n594\n00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:58.940\nthey're gonna have to manually enter that.\n\n595\n00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.790\nAnd you can increase the level\nof administration, right?\n\n596\n00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.319\nSo you can increase your blood pressure,\ncholesterol.\n\n597\n00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:04.822\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n598\n00:29:04.822 --> 00:29:07.330\nthe time that you have\nmaintaining the network.\n\n599\n00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.220\nAnd it might be a little bit more\nproblematic than it is actually\n\n600\n00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:10.890\ngood on security.\n\n601\n00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.510\nAll right, so they do talk about\nassigning static IP addresses, yes,\n\n602\n00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.140\nyou could do that.\n\n603\n00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.490\nKeep in mind that it is going to increase\nthe amount of administrative effort.\n\n604\n00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.250\nSome of the other things that you\ncould do too here is you could\n\n605\n00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.020\ndo things like MAC filtering.\n\n606\n00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.653\nNotice that we have the ability,\nthat if I wanna do MAC filtering,\n\n607\n00:29:31.653 --> 00:29:35.875\nI can restrict or\npermit devices connecting to my networks,\n\n608\n00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:38.961\nbased on the MAC addresses,\nif I wanted to.\n\n609\n00:29:38.961 --> 00:29:42.393\nAnd I don't know if it's gonna let me,\ncuz I still got WPS enabled here, so\n\n610\n00:29:42.393 --> 00:29:44.590\nit's not letting me do\nthe advanced settings.\n\n611\n00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.890\nBut you can see here that what\nI could do is I could say okay,\n\n612\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.730\nonly Dan's MAC address and\nmy MAC address can connect to the network.\n\n613\n00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:55.470\nOr maybe my computer can't connect\nto the network for what ever reason.\n\n614\n00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.950\nI don't want that MAC address on there.\n\n615\n00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.880\nAnd again, it's a great thing, but because\nof techniques that we have out there,\n\n616\n00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.150\nthis really again, it's more like just\npulling the blinds down at your house and\n\n617\n00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.400\nexpecting that somebody can't get into it.\n\n618\n00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.160\nBecause it can be changed and manipulated.\n\n619\n00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.910\nAll right, so\nI think we're pretty much good with that.\n\n620\n00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.885\nLet me go ahead,\nit let me do it there real quick.\n\n621\n00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:20.630\nAnd again,\nI could change the MAC addresses here, and\n\n622\n00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:25.690\nI could say hey, I only want,\nas long as I can type a MAC address,\n\n623\n00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:30.380\nthis MAC address to be able to join,\nright?\n\n624\n00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.690\nOr I could prevent, reverse his permit.\n\n625\n00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:37.740\nAll right, now, I'm gonna go ahead,\nand I'm just gonna leave that alone.\n\n626\n00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.507\nAnd I know it didn't like that,\nthat's fine.\n\n627\n00:30:39.507 --> 00:30:42.890\nNow, there are other things that you can\ndo, too, that talk about port forwarding.\n\n628\n00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.990\nI could do port forwarding, right?\n\n629\n00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:49.729\nI could say, hey, from the Internet side,\nwhen a computer sends traffic\n\n630\n00:30:49.729 --> 00:30:53.255\ninto my network,\nI want this based on the port number.\n\n631\n00:30:53.255 --> 00:30:55.770\nI want this information\nto go to this computer.\n\n632\n00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.696\nWe use this a lot in SoHos when you're\nconnecting from a work network, and\n\n633\n00:30:58.696 --> 00:31:01.717\nlet's say, an enterprise level network\nacross the Internet back into your\n\n634\n00:31:01.717 --> 00:31:02.680\nhome network, right?\n\n635\n00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.700\nAnd things like RDP remote desktop,\nwe use it a lot.\n\n636\n00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.750\nI know I use it on my network a lot too,\nyou could do this.\n\n637\n00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:13.060\nKeep in mind,\nyou could also do port filtering as well.\n\n638\n00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.630\nDisabling ports is just as\nsimple as don't open them up.\n\n639\n00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.830\nAll right, so\nkeep in mind that a port forward\n\n640\n00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.680\nis kind of like punching a hole\nin the dam, if you will.\n\n641\n00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.070\nIt's always open, so they also talk\nabout using things like port triggering.\n\n642\n00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.970\nAnd when we talk about port triggering,\n\n643\n00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.800\nthis is kinda like\ndynamic port forwarding.\n\n644\n00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.620\nIt says, you know what?\n\n645\n00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.920\nI see that port.\n\n646\n00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.310\nLet me forward it on over to that device.\n\n647\n00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.950\nYou're not using that communication?\n\n648\n00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.650\nLet me disable the port,\nright, which is a great thing.\n\n649\n00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.920\nIf you're not using the communication,\ndon't keep it on.\n\n650\n00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.516\nAll right,\nlast thing that I wanna mention,\n\n651\n00:31:46.516 --> 00:31:48.712\nI think I've got everything covered, Dan.\n\n652\n00:31:48.712 --> 00:31:53.451\nAnd the one thing that I didn't talk\nabout, actually, a couple of things, but\n\n653\n00:31:53.451 --> 00:31:57.362\nthe main thing here is firmware,\nall right, firmware updates.\n\n654\n00:31:57.362 --> 00:32:02.478\nNotice that this is Firmware 1.0.00.\n\n655\n00:32:02.478 --> 00:32:05.105\nChances are,\nthis is an out of date firmware.\n\n656\n00:32:05.105 --> 00:32:06.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Which means\n\n657\n00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.760\nthey could have found functionality flaws,\nsecurity vulnerabilities, or\n\n658\n00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.220\nthey could have added\nincreased functionality\n\n659\n00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.390\ninside of this device\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n660\n00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.600\nI'm not gonna be able to\ntake advantage of it.\n\n661\n00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.880\nNow, why am I not wanna\nupgrade my firmware?\n\n662\n00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.966\nLet me give you a case in point.\n\n663\n00:32:22.966 --> 00:32:28.600\nA lot of the firmware on the routers,\nwhen WPS, the wireless routers WPS,\n\n664\n00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.810\nwas first exploited, would not\nallow you to disable it, all right?\n\n665\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.710\nYou could turn it off,\nyou could turn it off in the interfaces.\n\n666\n00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.070\nBut you, if I would run a packet analyzer,\n\n667\n00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.350\nI could still see that WPS was\nunderneath the hood, still turned on.\n\n668\n00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.420\nAll right?\n\n669\n00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.170\nThe other thing that they did was it\ndidn't prevent brute-force attacks, right?\n\n670\n00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.237\nSomebody could just sit there and\nhammer, not really hammer away,\n\n671\n00:32:51.237 --> 00:32:54.094\nbut you let software, and automate\nthe process, And just over, and over, and\n\n672\n00:32:54.094 --> 00:32:58.410\nover, until they finally guess\nthe password, and they're on the network.\n\n673\n00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.560\nWell, manufacturers came out with\nfirmware updates that would stop that.\n\n674\n00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.770\nYou could do four or five guesses and\nit would lock the router out, instantly.\n\n675\n00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.168\nIt's sorry,\ntry again in 15 minutes, right?\n\n676\n00:33:08.168 --> 00:33:10.120\nWe stopped the brute-force attack.\n\n677\n00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.708\nBut if you don't do the firmware updates,\nguess what?\n\n678\n00:33:11.708 --> 00:33:15.020\nYou don't get to take advantage\nof that kind of functionality.\n\n679\n00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.110\nSo do your firmware updates.\n\n680\n00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.230\nLast but not least, and\nI'll quit doing the Columbo here, Dan.\n\n681\n00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.520\nLast but not least,\nphysical security, cuz guess what?\n\n682\n00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.406\nYou can go through all of the things that\nwe've talked about in the last half hour\n\n683\n00:33:29.406 --> 00:33:32.271\nto 35 minutes, But\nif I can touch your access point,\n\n684\n00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:34.646\nif I can grab that\naccess point physically,\n\n685\n00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:39.050\nit's no longer your network, and\nit's no longer your access point.\n\n686\n00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.570\nKeep your device physically secured,\nkeep it in a secure location.\n\n687\n00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.133\nKeep it in a location that if you don't\nhave something like we have here at\n\n688\n00:33:45.133 --> 00:33:47.792\nITPro.TV, or enterprise environments\nwhere they have server closets,\n\n689\n00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:51.930\nKeep it somewhere where only\nthe boss can get to it.\n\n690\n00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.780\nOr whereas,\nin public visibility at all times.\n\n691\n00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.170\nMaybe not public visibility but\nemployee visibility at all times.\n\n692\n00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.585\nKeep it safe cuz you can\ndo everything logically.\n\n693\n00:34:00.585 --> 00:34:03.358\nYou want to configure these,\nto make them secured, but\n\n694\n00:34:03.358 --> 00:34:07.370\nif they're not physically secured,\nyou'd basically wasted your time.\n\n695\n00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.119\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Wes have gone through\na litany, a laundry list as it were,\n\n696\n00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:14.941\nof security measures that we need to\ntake when it comes to our SOHO networks,\n\n697\n00:34:14.941 --> 00:34:18.554\nDefinitely go through them, make sure\nyou're very familiar with them so\n\n698\n00:34:18.554 --> 00:34:20.852\nthat you can employ them\nin your environment.\n\n699\n00:34:20.852 --> 00:34:23.940\nWes, thanks for your time enough\nwithin this show, we do appreciate it.\n\n700\n00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.950\nWe appreciate our audience for watching,\nbut it looks like we are out of time for\n\n701\n00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:28.090\nthis episode.\n\n702\n00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:29.143\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off, right?\n\n703\n00:34:29.143 --> 00:34:31.880\nITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n704\n00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.431\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n705\n00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:39.608\n[MUSIC]\n\n706\n00:34:39.608 --> 00:34:41.330\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.357\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:12.016\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:17.180\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for watching\nITProTV helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.720\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTia A + 902 and\n\n7\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.730\nwith me is the expert on this subject\nwho's bringing us all the information we\n\n8\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.990\nneed about troubleshooting today,\nand that's Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.180\nWes good morning sir.\n\n10\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n&gt;&gt; It is great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.774\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at\ntroubleshooting PC operating systems.\n\n13\n00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:40.710\nAnd I have to tell you, they've kinda\nmade my job a little difficult.\n\n14\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.850\nAnd what I mean by that is that well,\nreally when we talk about PC operating\n\n15\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.800\nsystems, a lot of times we're just\ntalking about Microsoft's Windows, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.950\nAnd I can tell It's getting harder and\nharder to create problems with inside\n\n17\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.625\nthe Windows operating system so that we\ncan demonstrate some of these issues.\n\n18\n00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:04.040\nAnd the reason I say that is because the\noperating system does a very good job of\n\n19\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.840\nreally protecting itself.\n\n20\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.760\nWe have things like system file\nprotection that has been inside\n\n21\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.630\nof the operating system for a while.\n\n22\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.160\nAnd but things can still arise, right?\n\n23\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.810\nThings can go a little haywire.\n\n24\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.030\nA lot of times what happens is it's\nsome kind of failure in the hardware.\n\n25\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.060\nCould be malware, which really\nisn't the operating system's fault.\n\n26\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.920\nCould just be our browsing habits, if you\nwill, or downloading email attachments.\n\n27\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.940\nBut we talk about troubleshooting\nPC operating systems.\n\n28\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.440\nThere are things that\nyou can still run into.\n\n29\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.760\nI mean, it's the reason you have\ncomputer repair companies out there and\n\n30\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.810\nwe're gonna try to dive into some of that.\n\n31\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.629\nWell, actually,\n\n32\n00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:42.813\nwe are gonna dive into just about every\nsingle one of the objectives here.\n\n33\n00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:47.524\nAnd we're gonna try to demonstrate some\nof the scenarios that you might see when\n\n34\n00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.618\nit comes to troubleshooting\nPC operating systems,\n\n35\n00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:55.329\nright down from things like blue screens,\nfrom forcing a spontaneous reboot of\n\n36\n00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.730\nthe machine to some other things\nwe might have to look at.\n\n37\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.720\nSo that's what we're gonna be looking\nat today, we're gonna be looking at\n\n38\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.610\ntroubleshooting the PC operating\nsystems inside primarily Windows today.\n\n39\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.380\nIf you were following along today,\nlet's go ahead.\n\n40\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.390\nSome of these objectives we can't get\nin the title here because again they're\n\n41\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.990\nquite long.\n\n42\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.080\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n43\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.560\nWe're looking at 4.1 today.\n\n44\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.140\nThis has given a scenario.\n\n45\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.200\nTroubleshoot PCI operating system\nproblems with the appropriate tools.\n\n46\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.039\nSo we're gonna see if we can\ntry to break Windows, and\n\n47\n00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.078\nlike I said it's getting more and\nmore difficult to break Windows because it\n\n48\n00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:31.557\ndoes a good job of\nmaintaining its integrity.\n\n49\n00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:36.957\nEven surviving a reboot, a crash and\ntrying to keep it running,\n\n50\n00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:40.460\nif you will, its lifecycle [LAUGH] going.\n\n51\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.340\nBut that's what we're gonna be\nlooking at inside of this episode.\n\n52\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.630\n&gt;&gt; Proprietary crash screens,\nlet's talk about that.\n\n53\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Proprietary crash screens, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.220\nThis really comes down to\nwhat's known as a kernel panic,\n\n55\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.700\nand every operating system has them.\n\n56\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.110\nKernel panic is where, basically,\nit's down in the kernel level,\n\n57\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.140\nand it's where, a lot of times you'll\nget it when you have driver issues.\n\n58\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.820\nAgain, keep in mind that when we talk\nabout driver issues, driver problems\n\n59\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.020\nreally a lot of times could be corrupted\neither because of a hard drive or\n\n60\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.155\nbecause of a malware, if you will,\nand even the manufacturers.\n\n61\n00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:16.700\nBut when I say that,\nlet me give you an instance where,\n\n62\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.710\nI keep kinda stressing this point that\noperating systems do a really good job,\n\n63\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.950\nespecially Windows in maintaining\nits integrity, right.\n\n64\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.990\nMicrosoft runs drivers through\na very rigorous process.\n\n65\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.500\nActually there's something out there\ncalled the Windows Hardware Quality Labs.\n\n66\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.630\nAnd essentially what they do\nis if a manufacturer wants to\n\n67\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.760\nhave their driver bundled into\nthe Windows operating system and\n\n68\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.450\nto be basically stamped with the Windows.\n\n69\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.010\nLet’s say if you had a Windows 8.1\nmachine or a Windows 7 machine.\n\n70\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.880\nAnd when you get a device right,\n\n71\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.730\non the outside of the box it’s got a stamp\nthat says Windows 7 ready Windows 8.1.\n\n72\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.920\nAnd I know by the time\nof this recording and\n\n73\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.590\nwe'll probably see it when the objectives\nupdate Windows 10 ready, right.\n\n74\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.700\nWell, for that to happen, for that piece\nof hardware to have that stamp on it,\n\n75\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.140\nthey have to submit their driver\nto Windows Hardware Quality Labs.\n\n76\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.950\nAnd they go through a pretty rigorous\nprocess, testing the driver for\n\n77\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.430\nits integrity, making sure that it\ndoesn't cause kernel mode errors.\n\n78\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.870\nThese kernel mode errors,\nremember what happens in kernel mode.\n\n79\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.680\nKernel mode is a shared memory space and\nthis is where your drivers sit,\n\n80\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.110\nyour executive services sit.\n\n81\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.710\nThis is where the NTOSKRNL or\nthe NT kernel sits, right?\n\n82\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.000\nAnd they all share this memory space,\n\n83\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.290\nwhich means if a driver corrupts, it can\ncorrupt other data that's being shared and\n\n84\n00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.710\nbeing utilized by all the other drivers,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.260\nAnd that's where you usually get these\nblue screens, right, proprietary screens.\n\n86\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.540\nYou'll see in here they\ntalk about pinwheel.\n\n87\n00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.370\nPinwheel really isn't, isn't really\na crash screen, not for PC at least.\n\n88\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.570\nThat's actually, a pinwheel is\nsomething that you see inside a Mac.\n\n89\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.340\nThis little spinning wheel that\nlocks up and that does happen.\n\n90\n00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.960\nBut with Windows like I said, with\nthe drivers down there in the kernel mode,\n\n91\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.000\nyes they can cause blue screens.\n\n92\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.770\nAnd that's a kernel panic, right?\n\n93\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.590\nIt usually happens through\na general protection fault and\n\n94\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.960\nbasically the CPU shuts itself down.\n\n95\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.350\nWhat you have is you have\nwhat's known as a memory dump.\n\n96\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.760\nAnd a memory dump essentially\nis Windows way of just grabbing\n\n97\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.910\neverything that was in RAM at that\ntime and dumping it into a file.\n\n98\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.260\nAnd in that file, a .dmp file essentially\ncan be analyzed by an engineer.\n\n99\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.870\nIt's not really for\n\n100\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.200\nthe average tech, I can't read\na dump file to save my life, right?\n\n101\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.360\nIt's a lot of garbled, not garbage but\na lot of garbled output if you will.\n\n102\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.872\nAnd you can do debugging with it, right.\n\n103\n00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:38.440\nNow, I say that it's not for\nthe average tech.\n\n104\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.550\nLet me go ahead and just throw like\na parenthesis statement in here.\n\n105\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.530\nMicrosoft released what's\nknown as the MDOP, right.\n\n106\n00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.860\nThat's the Microsoft\nDesktop Optimization Pack.\n\n107\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.820\nIt is amazing and it's got inside\nof it something known as DART,\n\n108\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.260\nthe Diagnostic And Recovery Toolkit.\n\n109\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.080\nAnd inside of that, you can create\na DART recovery preinstallation\n\n110\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.690\nenvironment disk in which you can use\nsomething known as the Crash Analyzer.\n\n111\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.050\nAnd the Crazy Analyzer is worth\nits weight in gold because\n\n112\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.740\nyou gotta go through a couple processes.\n\n113\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.280\nYou download the software development\ntoolkit and inside of that,\n\n114\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.790\nthey have debugging tools.\n\n115\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.690\nAnd you bundle that together with\nthe Crash Analyzer and it could take\n\n116\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.070\nthose dump files that traditionally\nhaven't meant anything to a tech.\n\n117\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.660\nAgain, the average tech, outside of\nlike an architect or an engineer and\n\n118\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.170\nit can grab that dump file, it can analyze\nit for you and it can tell you what\n\n119\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.970\nthe application, the driver of the device\nwas that caused the problem, right.\n\n120\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.280\nIt caused the blue screen all right.\n\n121\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.990\nNow, let's go ahead and let's see if we\ncan create a blue screen right here so\n\n122\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.050\nyou guys can see what\nthe proprietary screen is.\n\n123\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.190\nIn fact, I got a Windows 8.1 machine,\nand Sysinternals,\n\n124\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.920\nthis is another company that is\nactually owned by Microsoft.\n\n125\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.304\nOriginally it wasn't owned by Microsoft,\nbut they do just,\n\n126\n00:06:51.304 --> 00:06:54.830\nThey've got just a great suite of\nutilities that Microsoft bought them and\n\n127\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.920\nthey were like, hey,\nyou need to come work for us.\n\n128\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.460\nSo if you get a chance,\nthis is called, it's not my fault.\n\n129\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.230\nSo understand that I'm gonna\ncreate a blue screen here so\n\n130\n00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.360\nthat we can demonstrate the scenario\nthat you might see on the exam,\n\n131\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.410\nbut understand that this application\nis creating If you will,\n\n132\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.680\nthe blue screen if you will,\nor the crash, right?\n\n133\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.460\nNow I say that listen, we're gonna see\nthe crash screen, it's also called a BSOD,\n\n134\n00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.100\nthe blue screen of death if you will, and\n\n135\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.942\nagain-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:22.070\n&gt;&gt; Its' Kernel Panic.\n\n137\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.000\nAll operating systems have these,\n\n138\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.330\nit just depends if it's proprietary on how\nthey display it to you when it happens.\n\n139\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.087\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n140\n00:07:29.087 --> 00:07:31.220\nSo if I launch up my It's Not My Fault.\n\n141\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.999\nI always say It's Not My Fault,\nit's called Not My Fault here.\n\n142\n00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.582\n&gt;&gt; Not My Fault.\n\n143\n00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:38.110\nThere are a couple of different types\nof blue screens that we can create.\n\n144\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.750\nNotice they have a kernel mode and\nthey have a user mode.\n\n145\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.353\nSometimes the user mode, what's gonna end\nup happening is it just kind of wigs out\n\n146\n00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:50.022\nthe screen, maybe your desktop DEWM, your\nWindows Desktop Manager kind of resets\n\n147\n00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:52.177\nitself and brings your desktop back.\n\n148\n00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:54.668\nAnd again this is Windows\nway of correcting itself.\n\n149\n00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:56.937\nThey've taken a lot of\nthe functionality and\n\n150\n00:07:56.937 --> 00:08:00.996\nthey put it in user mode because it just\naffects the user and the user profile, but\n\n151\n00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:04.422\nnot the kernel mode which can corrupt\ndrivers in the system as well.\n\n152\n00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:07.476\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create a kernel panic or\n\n153\n00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:11.460\na crash screen if you will that's\ndown there in the kernel mode here.\n\n154\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.925\nAnd lets see what it looks like we're\ngonna go ahead and crash it, there we go.\n\n155\n00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:17.005\nSo, notice what's happening here.\n\n156\n00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:18.685\nYou'll find this, and, sometimes,\n\n157\n00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:24.195\nthis information doesn't look like it\nreally gives us, really, any information.\n\n158\n00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:28.305\nBut, I really like this, because what\nthey're telling you here is, driver, and\n\n159\n00:08:28.305 --> 00:08:33.360\nI know it happened kinda fast, but\nit's a driver not equal to, or less than.\n\n160\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.030\nIt gives you a little bit of information.\n\n161\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.850\nIt used to show you in the earlier days,\nlike Windows seven and prior,\n\n162\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:43.320\nit would show you memory locations and\nit would basically be a memory address.\n\n163\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.840\nThat IRQ is what's known as\nan Interrupt Request Line.\n\n164\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.705\nUnderstand going way back in the earlier\ndays, prior to things like plug and\n\n165\n00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:57.256\nplay and also something known as ACPI, the\nAdvanced Configuration Power Interface,\n\n166\n00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:01.303\nwe would have to manually\nconfigure interrupt request lines.\n\n167\n00:09:01.303 --> 00:09:05.751\nAnd that's because when you think about\na CPU, a CPU has to be interrupted so that\n\n168\n00:09:05.751 --> 00:09:10.134\na device can communicate with the we could\nuse our devices because a CPU is just so\n\n169\n00:09:10.134 --> 00:09:14.455\nfast that everything else is just the\nhundreds and thousands of times slower,\n\n170\n00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:16.400\nmillions of times slower than it.\n\n171\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.940\nSo what you would have to do is you\nwould have to setup the resources and\n\n172\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.710\nyou would have to manually say, okay,\nyou're gonna interrupt the CPU through\n\n173\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.300\nthis line, you set this IRQ to this\ndevice, your system clock uses this IRQ.\n\n174\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.280\nWell, today we don't need to worry about\nthat Windows and I'll actually show you\n\n175\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.300\nwhere you can see this Windows in\nthe background manages that for us.\n\n176\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.910\nHowever, understand that only one\ndevice typically can use an IRQ.\n\n177\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.730\nAnd what happens is when you've got two\nsignals that are sent over the same IRQ,\n\n178\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.720\nthey cause a conflict.\n\n179\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.850\nA lot of times,\nthat can be a driver issue.\n\n180\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.920\nLooks like I've got a Windows update\nrunning here in the background.\n\n181\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.120\nHopefully, it doesn't take too long, and\n\n182\n00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.795\nhopefully it doesn't cause\na crash right here on the screen.\n\n183\n00:09:53.795 --> 00:09:56.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we do while this is running.\n\n184\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.900\nSo the IRQ what that's letting you\nknow is that we had a conflict.\n\n185\n00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.890\nThis application basically stole\nan IRQ that was already being\n\n186\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.200\nutilized by the operating system for\nanother procedure or process.\n\n187\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.640\nAnd because of that conflict\nthe application caused the reboot.\n\n188\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.430\nWe'll see that here in a second.\n\n189\n00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.520\nAll right.\nSo we see that the computer has rebooted\n\n190\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.660\nhere so we can log back in and one of the\nthings that is interesting that we can do\n\n191\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.280\nis we can actually see\nthe results of a Kernel panic\n\n192\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.960\ninside of a utility inside of Windows,\nit's actually called out here within all\n\n193\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.550\nof these different utilities that we\nhave our tool within the objectives.\n\n194\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.470\nThey call out what's\nknown as a bad viewer.\n\n195\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.768\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n196\n00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:44.300\nIf I right-click on the Windows,\n\n197\n00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.270\ncharm here, you'll notice that third\ndown from the top we have event viewer.\n\n198\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.510\nI also want you guys and\n\n199\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.170\ngals out there to keep in mind that\nthis is in computer management.\n\n200\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.170\nSo if I launch computer management we\nhave event viewer in the list here too.\n\n201\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.870\nSo a couple different ways\nthat you can find it.\n\n202\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.230\nA lot of times I like using the computer\nmanagement because it's kind of like your\n\n203\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.420\nconvenience store for\ndifferent system utilities.\n\n204\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.160\nIt's a one stop shop and\nyou get everything bundled in.\n\n205\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.400\nBut, I'm gonna go ahead and just for\n\n206\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.220\na little bit more real estate on this\nI'm gonna just use the event viewer MMC.\n\n207\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.190\nAgain, it gives us a little\nbit more real estate here.\n\n208\n00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.425\nSo, what I'm looking for\nis the Windows Logs, right?\n\n209\n00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:28.215\nAnd we've talked about in other episodes,\n\n210\n00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:31.675\nwe've talked pretty extensively about this\nutility, kind of showed you how to use it.\n\n211\n00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:35.597\nSo, we'll go back to those features and\nthose administrative tools.\n\n212\n00:11:35.597 --> 00:11:37.177\nDefinitely want you to be aware of this.\n\n213\n00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:40.307\nSo the log that I'm looking for\nis the System log, right?\n\n214\n00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:46.327\nAnd when I choose the System log, one of\nthe things that you might notice is that,\n\n215\n00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:48.987\nlet me see here,\nif I'm gonna filter the log.\n\n216\n00:11:48.987 --> 00:11:51.547\nSo over here on the actions\npane on the right-hand\n\n217\n00:11:51.547 --> 00:11:53.537\nside I'm gonna choose Filter Log.\n\n218\n00:11:53.537 --> 00:11:57.207\nAnd I'm gonna do Critical, Error, and\nWarning, and I'm gonna choose OK.\n\n219\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.220\nAnd I should see in here somewhere,\nthere should be a,\n\n220\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.660\nlet's find out here,\nlet's see if we can find it.\n\n221\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.310\nAnd if not, I don't have a critical,\nthere's a critical,\n\n222\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.500\nthere we go, that's what I'm looking for.\n\n223\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.780\nAll right, and if I look, notice that I\nhave this Kernel power failure, right?\n\n224\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.340\nThis is one of the things\nthat it tells me.\n\n225\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.890\nNotice it says, the system is rebooted\nwith clearly shutting down first.\n\n226\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.260\nThis error could be caused if\nthe system stopped responding,\n\n227\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.660\nthis could be a PC lock up,\ncrashed or lost power.\n\n228\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.450\nIn this case it is a crash, right?\n\n229\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.050\nIt crashed the system, right?\n\n230\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.930\nAnd we can see that this is\na critical level error all right,\n\n231\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.018\nso understand that this is one of the ways\nthat you can diagnose when one of\n\n232\n00:12:42.018 --> 00:12:42.670\nthese problems happens.\n\n233\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.740\nNow I believe that you should see because\nof the fact that this was an application\n\n234\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.740\nthat caused the problem.\n\n235\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.740\nWe should be able to see this if I\nremember right in application too.\n\n236\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.988\nLet me just check.\n\n237\n00:12:55.988 --> 00:12:59.790\nI can't remember off the top of my head,\n\n238\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.350\nit'll also log one in application,\nI'm pretty sure it should.\n\n239\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.020\nLet's see here.\n\n240\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.890\nThat's license activation, oops.\n\n241\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.780\nNo, I'm not really seeing\nanything in here, no, no, no, no.\n\n242\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.475\nThese are old, no, so\nI'm not really getting anything here.\n\n243\n00:13:19.475 --> 00:13:22.790\n[INAUDIBLE]\nOkay so,\n\n244\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.550\nno I'm not actually seeing that in there.\n\n245\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.640\nBut I could see,\nthat it was inside of the system logs,\n\n246\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.190\nit was letting me know that there\nwere some kinda problem here and\n\n247\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.260\nwe need to kinda investigate,and\nsee what's going on.\n\n248\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:42.190\nSo, keep in mind that you can have\nthose situations in which you don't get\n\n249\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:47.520\nthe ability, if you will, to actually see\nwhat the information was on the screen.\n\n250\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.660\nSometimes you can pause that,\nlet me show you where you can do that.\n\n251\n00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.700\nOne of the things that I like to do as\na tech, if we go back to our desktop,\n\n252\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.530\nwe right click on our\nwindows tile here and\n\n253\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.790\nI go to systems this time there is a\ncouple of other things that you can do and\n\n254\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.695\nthis is one of the things that I kind of\nlike to do which some of the machines\n\n255\n00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:10.865\nI support, just because if there is\na blue screen, I wanna know about it.\n\n256\n00:14:10.865 --> 00:14:14.045\nNotice how it rebooted automatically,\nand I couldn't tell what was going on,\n\n257\n00:14:14.045 --> 00:14:16.095\nI couldn't get any information, right?\n\n258\n00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:17.345\nWell, you can actually change that.\n\n259\n00:14:17.345 --> 00:14:22.005\nIf I go into Advanced system\nsettings right here, and\n\n260\n00:14:22.005 --> 00:14:26.725\nnotice that we have this Advanced tab and\nwe have Startup and Recovery.\n\n261\n00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:30.750\nThis is kind of important for\nme Notice that I have the settings button.\n\n262\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.760\nIf I choose the settings button,\n\n263\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.470\nby default you'll notice that it says\nautomatically restart the machine.\n\n264\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.660\nI usually clear that.\n\n265\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.180\nAll right, notice that I take the check\nmark out of the box there and\n\n266\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.210\nI choose OK, and I'll choose OK again.\n\n267\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.940\nNow watch what happens this time.\n\n268\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and re-run this.\n\n269\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.770\nWe're gonna cause another memory dump.\n\n270\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.505\nWe're gonna see if we\ncan break Windows here.\n\n271\n00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:55.117\n[CROSSTALK] Happen, I tried very hard.\n\n272\n00:14:55.117 --> 00:14:58.730\nYou guys out there at Microsoft, you're\nmaking it very hard for me to do my job.\n\n273\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.420\nI'm trying to break this operating system,\nand it just keeps coming back to life.\n\n274\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.380\nBut let's go ahead, we're gonna\nrun not my fault one more time.\n\n275\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.840\nAgain, from sys internals we gotta\ngive Mark out there credit there.\n\n276\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.370\nAbsolutely great program here, and\nyou can see why we're using it.\n\n277\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.430\nZach, you asked a great\nquestion in the break.\n\n278\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.420\nAnd between episodes here said hey,\nwhy would you use something like that?\n\n279\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.900\nWell exactly, training.\n\n280\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.660\n&gt;&gt; Training, training.\n\n281\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.410\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and crash.\n\n282\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.500\nWe crashed the system here.\n\n283\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.680\nNotice that it is doing a memory dump,\nall right?\n\n284\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.360\nNotice that it says driver IRQ\nnot less than or equal to.\n\n285\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.350\nAnd it's telling you what the system\nfile is here and that's important for\n\n286\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.500\nme, all right?\n\n287\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.550\nNow, notice here, too, what's going on.\n\n288\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.390\nNotice that it's a 100% complete,\nso it's going on.\n\n289\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.080\nWe're just collecting some error info and\nthen you can restart.\n\n290\n00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.930\nIt takes that information\nthat's in RAM at the time, and\n\n291\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.610\nit dumps it right into a file.\n\n292\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.802\nAnd, again, traditionally, you're suppose\nto be able to take these dump files,\n\n293\n00:15:55.802 --> 00:15:57.939\nyou can hand them over\nto some kind of tech.\n\n294\n00:15:57.939 --> 00:15:59.905\nThey had the diagnostic and\nrecovery tool kit,\n\n295\n00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:02.622\nin which you can actually put these\ninside of the crash analyzer.\n\n296\n00:16:02.622 --> 00:16:06.526\nWell, if you don't see this information,\nyou're not gonna know what's going on.\n\n297\n00:16:06.526 --> 00:16:10.294\nAnd this is a great way to kinda\nactually find out what's going on here.\n\n298\n00:16:10.294 --> 00:16:12.798\nNotice, it tells me inside\nof this information, hey,\n\n299\n00:16:12.798 --> 00:16:14.520\nthere's a driver issue of some sort.\n\n300\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.869\nAnd the IRQ, not less than or equal to,\nagain, different IRQs that we have,\n\n301\n00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:23.588\nand this is the system file that's\nactually causing the problem.\n\n302\n00:16:23.588 --> 00:16:25.834\nAnd you could see it, it says myfault.sys.\n\n303\n00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:28.207\nThis is supposed to happen, right?\n\n304\n00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:29.659\nIt's happening on purpose, right?\n\n305\n00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:33.638\nWell, I'm generating this, but\nthis is what you would see in a situation,\n\n306\n00:16:33.638 --> 00:16:36.140\nwhere maybe you did download a driver,\nright?\n\n307\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.320\nYou downloaded the driver, you installed\nthe driver, and it causes an issue.\n\n308\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.100\nWell, that could be a problem, right?\n\n309\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.850\nThat causes a problem, because if\nthat driver becomes problematic and\n\n310\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.370\nit does cause a blue screen, I don't\nknow what the driver issue might be.\n\n311\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.350\nThis gives me the ability to see that now.\n\n312\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.630\nThis is also an improper shutdown as well,\nand I want you to keep that in mind too.\n\n313\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.435\nThe other improper\nshutdowns that you have,\n\n314\n00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.260\nwe have a couple of different\ntypes of shutdowns,\n\n315\n00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.750\nyou have what's known as a hard boot, and\nwhat's known as a soft boot, All right?\n\n316\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.970\nLet me show you what a hard boot is, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.690\nA hard boot would be like me\npushing the power on the machine.\n\n318\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.490\nIn fact, I'm gonna virtualize\nthis here in the virtual machine.\n\n319\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.870\nBut if I reached over, and I press power,\n\n320\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.910\nand I held it on, the power button\non the physical machine, right?\n\n321\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.945\nThat's what's known as a hard boot,\nall right?\n\n322\n00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:25.370\nAnd I'm gonna try and do that right here.\n\n323\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.240\nWe'll do it and we'll see if it\ndoes the restart, all right?\n\n324\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.160\nSo that's called a hard boot, all right?\n\n325\n00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.800\nA soft boot is a little bit different.\n\n326\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.160\nA soft boot is where you do\na graceful shutdown, right?\n\n327\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.396\nAnd a soft boot is where you're going\nto actually restart the machine.\n\n328\n00:17:38.396 --> 00:17:42.090\nIt's called a graceful shutdown,\nor a graceful restart.\n\n329\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.670\nAnd that's one where I actually would,\nand here let me show you guys,\n\n330\n00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.590\nmy head's kinda covering it up here, but\n\n331\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.670\nif I was to restart the machine\nhere by choosing Restart, right?\n\n332\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.834\nThat's a soft reboot, it's different,\nhard reboot I think of a hardware reboot,\n\n333\n00:17:55.834 --> 00:17:57.726\nthat's how I remember it on the exam.\n\n334\n00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:03.310\nVersus a soft reboot, software reboot,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n335\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.812\nSo we can see that\ninformation right there too.\n\n336\n00:18:05.812 --> 00:18:11.530\nNow, there are times when you\nmight have overheating issues.\n\n337\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.000\nSo for instance, CPUs, and again,\nnotice what we're talking about here.\n\n338\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.910\nThis machine is recovering, all right?\n\n339\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:23.220\nI'm creating blue screens,\nI am creating kernel mode blue screens.\n\n340\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.400\nAnd Windows keeps coming back all right?\n\n341\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.113\nIt's kinda like a Rocky fight, right?\n\n342\n00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.915\nYou get knocked down and it's back up and\n\n343\n00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:31.570\nit's saying, hey,\nwe're back here to go again, right?\n\n344\n00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.360\nSo we're gonna throw some stuff at it.\n\n345\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.920\nI'm not gonna be biased in anyway.\n\n346\n00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.400\nI'm gonna hit pretty hard,\nwhen it comes to this machine.\n\n347\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.441\n&gt;&gt; It takes a leaking [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely does Zack.\n\n348\n00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:48.160\nSo let me show you a couple of\nother things that we can also do.\n\n349\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.960\nSometimes, what you might\nhave is a failure to boot.\n\n350\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.070\nAnd well, failure to boot can be a couple\nof different reasons, all right?\n\n351\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:04.820\nA failure to boot might\nbe because you have\n\n352\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.570\nan improper boot sequence set, not in your\noperating system, but in the BIOS itself.\n\n353\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.112\nThat does sometimes happen.\n\n354\n00:19:11.112 --> 00:19:14.143\nAnd one of the ways you can typically\nsee that is when you boot into,\n\n355\n00:19:14.143 --> 00:19:16.540\nyou could see it,\na couple different ways, right?\n\n356\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.990\nWe can boot in the BIOS,\nand what we can see is that\n\n357\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.640\nmaybe we have the optical disc.\n\n358\n00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:31.740\nThe optical drive is actually populated,\nand it's populated with a disc that\n\n359\n00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.840\nreally isn't supposed to be bootable\nat all, could be a software disk.\n\n360\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.810\nThe other thing that might cause this,\nis when you have, for\n\n361\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.930\ninstance, a USB device that's bootable,\n\n362\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:51.570\nthat's actually plugged into the USB port,\nwhen that ends up happening.\n\n363\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.080\nThat could be a problem as well.\n\n364\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.204\nThat could be the fact that it's trying to\nboot to that USB device, and what ends up\n\n365\n00:19:58.204 --> 00:20:03.424\nhappening is again, and let's go ahead and\nI'll try to create this problem here.\n\n366\n00:20:03.424 --> 00:20:06.660\nIf we could show my screen,\nnotice what's happening here, all right?\n\n367\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.360\nYou might get a failure to boot as well,\nand\n\n368\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.167\nit might actually boot\nright into recovery.\n\n369\n00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:14.139\nLet's see if it's actually gonna\ngo into its automatic repair.\n\n370\n00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:15.890\nYep, there we go.\n\n371\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.590\nSo this might be something that\nends up happening as well.\n\n372\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.240\nLet me see if I can pause that, all right.\n\n373\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.922\nSo here is something that can happen,\nall right?\n\n374\n00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:26.772\nSpontaneous shut downs and reboots.\n\n375\n00:20:26.772 --> 00:20:29.323\nYou could see that a PC,\nits CPU is overheating or\n\n376\n00:20:29.323 --> 00:20:30.950\nhaving an overheating issue.\n\n377\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.960\nIt could be a failure to boot,\nthe fact that,\n\n378\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.220\nnotice it says that looks like\nWindows didn't load correctly.\n\n379\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.790\nWhat you couldn't see in the background\nthere, I didn't wanna waste your time,\n\n380\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.920\nis I was constantly doing\na spontaneous reboot of this machine.\n\n381\n00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.190\nThis actually happens when CPUs overheat,\n\n382\n00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.810\nor the internal temperature of\nthe system starts to heat up.\n\n383\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.290\nWhat happens is your CPUs have\nthese thermal temperature sensors.\n\n384\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.140\nAnd internal thermal temperature\nsensor will trigger,\n\n385\n00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.140\nand will shut the whole machine down.\n\n386\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.820\nAnd it's your CPU's way\nof protecting itself.\n\n387\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.010\nNow, if it happens too many times,\nwhy did the machine fail to load?\n\n388\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.143\nWhy did Windows not load?\n\n389\n00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:13.539\nWell, again, a failure to boot.\n\n390\n00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:14.690\nA couple of things can happen.\n\n391\n00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.630\nLike I said, going back to\nthe first thing, a failure to boot\n\n392\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:22.400\ncould be the fact that you have a non-boot\ndevice plugged into a USB port, and\n\n393\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.720\nyou have pointed your boot sequence and\nBIOS, to that location.\n\n394\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.060\nIf you get multiple of these spontaneous\nrestarts or shutdowns, what's going on?\n\n395\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.940\nWe go back to my screen here.\n\n396\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.720\nNotice it says, if you'd like to restart\nand try again, just click restart my PC.\n\n397\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.620\nOtherwise, choose\nthe advanced repair option.\n\n398\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.212\nNotice it says, it looks like\nWindows didn't load correctly.\n\n399\n00:21:45.212 --> 00:21:47.210\nOkay, so what's loading here?\n\n400\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.080\nAll right, so let me tell you\na little bit about the boot process.\n\n401\n00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.350\nWhen Windows goes to load, you have\nwhat's known as a boot manager, and\n\n402\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.165\nyou have what's known as an operating\nsystem loader, all right?\n\n403\n00:21:57.165 --> 00:22:04.759\nWhat the boot manager, and\nan operating system loader, all right?\n\n404\n00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:08.333\nThe boot manager, what is it,\nbootmgr.exe, all right?\n\n405\n00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:12.310\nIt looks, and it says, what operating\nsystem am I gonna load, all right?\n\n406\n00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.345\nNow, if it finds a non-Windows-based\noperating system, it loads a very generic\n\n407\n00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:20.341\nDOS-based boot loader, and it lets the\nother operating system take over the PC.\n\n408\n00:22:20.341 --> 00:22:22.450\nIt happens in multiboot.\n\n409\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:23.960\nHowever, the other thing that it can do,\n\n410\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.880\nis it can also look for\nother Windows operating system loaders.\n\n411\n00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.360\nIf it's the earlier loaders, like XP,\nit's gonna be looking for NTLDR, right?\n\n412\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.340\nThat was the XP prior to Vista,\nthey had a different architecture, and\n\n413\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.170\nit would use NTLDR.\n\n414\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.660\nNow, if that's missing,\nyou can get a missing NTLDR,\n\n415\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.490\nthen what you will have to do, is you'd\nhave to boot into recovery environment.\n\n416\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.700\nYou'd have to repair or a repair disk, and\n\n417\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.510\nyou would have to repair\nyour operating system.\n\n418\n00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.030\nSince Vista, and all the way up to Windows\n10 today, and including Windows 8.1,\n\n419\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.426\nwhat the boot manager is looking for,\nis something known as winload.exe.\n\n420\n00:22:56.426 --> 00:23:01.683\nwinload.exe is actually the Windows\noperating system loader of today,\n\n421\n00:23:01.683 --> 00:23:04.480\nin Vista, and all that really.\n\n422\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.650\nAll right,\nnow when that file gets corrupted,\n\n423\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.270\nit doesn't load the operating system.\n\n424\n00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:13.071\nIt's also looking for\nanother file called NTOSKRNL.\n\n425\n00:23:13.071 --> 00:23:15.380\nWell, what is that?\n\n426\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.880\nThat's the Windows kernel, all right?\n\n427\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.810\nSo see what's going on?\n\n428\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.150\nWe have a chain of events going on.\n\n429\n00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.840\nWe have the boot manager that\nis looking for winload.exe,\n\n430\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.820\nwhich is the operating system loader.\n\n431\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.720\nAnd the operating system loader starts\nthe files, it starts the system files,\n\n432\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.140\nloads system drivers, and\nthen looks for the kernel, and\n\n433\n00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.610\nloads the kernel in a RAM, okay?\n\n434\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.610\nNow, why did that screen that we\nshowed you, why it didn't load?\n\n435\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.560\nIf it didn't find the operating system,\nwhat the heck are we seeing there?\n\n436\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.240\nWell, understand that every time\nyour computer boots, all right?\n\n437\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.378\nWhen your computer boots,\n\n438\n00:23:50.378 --> 00:23:55.803\nit sets a little flag to automatically\nfailover to recovery, all right?\n\n439\n00:23:55.803 --> 00:23:58.442\nIt's called automatic recovery failover,\nall right?\n\n440\n00:23:58.442 --> 00:24:03.839\nAnd it sets a little flag, and it lets\nthe bootmgr know don't load WinLoad.\n\n441\n00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:05.706\nDon't load the operating system loader.\n\n442\n00:24:05.706 --> 00:24:07.940\nSomething went wrong.\n\n443\n00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.480\nLoad the recovery environment.\n\n444\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.640\nLoad the pre-installation environment.\n\n445\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.220\nSo that you can fix it if you need to.\n\n446\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.430\nNow this happens every time you\nboot your machine, every time,\n\n447\n00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.440\nwhether something's wrong or not.\n\n448\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.040\nAs it goes through the boot process,\n\n449\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.210\nif it finds that there's nothing wrong,\nit loads WinLoad.\n\n450\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.090\nIt still has that flag set though.\n\n451\n00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.110\nKeep in mind that recovery\nenvironment flag is set.\n\n452\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.395\nWinLoad loads, starts the file system,\ninitializes the file systems,\n\n453\n00:24:36.395 --> 00:24:38.065\nstarts the system drivers.\n\n454\n00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:41.378\nAnd then goes to the NTOSKRNL and\nloads the kernel, and\n\n455\n00:24:41.378 --> 00:24:44.450\nthe kernel starts to\ncome online in bootstrap.\n\n456\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.110\nThen you're presented with a logon screen.\n\n457\n00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.570\nWhen you log onto your machine,\nthe boot loader,\n\n458\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.250\nthe boot MGR,\nremoves the recovery flag, removes it.\n\n459\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.890\nSo I want you to understand that the boot\nprocess is never fully finished until you\n\n460\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.150\nsuccessfully log onto the machine.\n\n461\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.390\nNow why is that beneficial?\n\n462\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.890\nWell, imagine us going\nto this boot process.\n\n463\n00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:14.770\nAnd we spontaneously keeps restarting and\nrestarting, keeps restarting.\n\n464\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.320\nSomething is wrong.\n\n465\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.820\nI've never got to log in.\n\n466\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.490\nSo at a certain point the boot\nmanager notices that and automatically\n\n467\n00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.820\nloads the recovery environment and\nthat's what we're seeing here.\n\n468\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.870\n&gt;&gt; It's a fail safe, right?\n\n469\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.350\n&gt;&gt; It is a fail safe,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n470\n00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:33.750\nSo again, as a real quick recap,\nwe boot process starts,\n\n471\n00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.150\nset the recovery environment.\n\n472\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.750\nSet that pre-installation environment so\nwe can go into a system recovery option.\n\n473\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.140\nOnce you normally boot\nthe operating system and\n\n474\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.030\nyou log in to it system is just fine.\n\n475\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.290\nBoot process has finished successfully.\n\n476\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.690\nWe have successfully booted\nthe operating system.\n\n477\n00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.980\nThe recovery flag is removed.\n\n478\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.690\nNow when you restart your computer,\nsame thing happens again.\n\n479\n00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.920\nSet the recovery flag,\n\n480\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.530\nif you end up booting into the machine,\neverything is fine.\n\n481\n00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.610\nAll right, so\nthat's a little bit drawn out there, but\n\n482\n00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.440\nthat's essentially what's happening.\n\n483\n00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.760\nIt's more in depth than that and we could\ntalk about some other files that are down\n\n484\n00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.920\nin there like the hyrofill.sys file,\nbut that should be enough for the exam.\n\n485\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.790\nKnowing that you have the boot MGR.exe,\nthat's a Windows boot manager.\n\n486\n00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.870\nKnowing that you have winload.exe,\nin the earlier days and\n\n487\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.400\nit's still in the exam objectives.\n\n488\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.150\nAnd I kind of disagree\nwith this one because XP\n\n489\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.670\nis not an operating system that you're\nrequired to know for this exam but\n\n490\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.380\nthey do say missing ntldr,\nthat's XP's boot logger.\n\n491\n00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.640\nYou don't find that in Windows Vista or\nany of the operating systems after that.\n\n492\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.856\nIt's winload.exe.\n\n493\n00:26:39.856 --> 00:26:41.389\nSo, I did want you to know that.\n\n494\n00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:44.243\nAnd I do want you to know why we're\nseeing this recovery environment.\n\n495\n00:26:44.243 --> 00:26:48.883\nBecause, if something goes wrong,\nif I get these spontaneous restarts,\n\n496\n00:26:48.883 --> 00:26:53.095\nI need a way that I can get into this\noperating system to try to fix it.\n\n497\n00:26:53.095 --> 00:27:00.090\nNow, let's go ahead and I know we're\ncoming up short on time here, Zach.\n\n498\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.370\nSo let me go ahead real quick-\n&gt;&gt; As usual you're doing a wonderful job,\n\n499\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.350\nbecause no stone unturned, thank you.\n\n500\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nI'll tell you what we're gonna do.\n\n501\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.020\nLet's go ahead,\nwe're gonna leave you with a cliffhanger.\n\n502\n00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.120\nWe're gonna leave you right here\nat this recovery environment.\n\n503\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.670\nIn fact if we could show that,\nthank you, out there to our director.\n\n504\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.210\nWe can show you that just one more time.\n\n505\n00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.420\nWe're gonna go a little bit farther and\n\n506\n00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.880\nwe're gonna show you some of\nthe advanced repair options,\n\n507\n00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.420\nif you do come across, some of these\nspontaneous boots, if you will.\n\n508\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.710\nImproper shutdowns,\n\n509\n00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:34.510\nfailure to boot, proprietary\ncrash machine or crash screens.\n\n510\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.980\nAnd you might have to fix\nyour operating system.\n\n511\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.840\nBut, looks like you're gonna\nhave to come back to part two.\n\n512\n00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.690\nMight have to put a comma in this one.\n\n513\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.531\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\nTroubleshooting PC operating systems.\n\n514\n00:27:43.531 -->

do.\n\n10\n00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:32.366\nAnd the person bringing us all the\ninformation today is our ITPro, Wes Bryan,\n\n11\n00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:32.990\nhey, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.862\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how are you doing, Zach?\n\n13\n00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:35.781\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nGreat to be here, and that is right,\n\n14\n00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.675\nI talked way too much in the first part.\n\n15\n00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:41.597\nBut all kidding aside,\nwe have a lot of stuff to go through, and\n\n16\n00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:44.270\nWindows really doesn't make my job easy.\n\n17\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.350\nWhen we talk about [LAUGH] troubleshooting\nour PC operating systems, a lot of times,\n\n18\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.400\nit's really not the operating\nsystem that is causing the problem.\n\n19\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400\nAnd I certainly don't mean end users,\nwell, maybe in some cases.\n\n20\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.821\nMalware, again,\ncan cause these problems as well.\n\n21\n00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.603\nBut sometimes, it's hardware issues,\njust like we've seen in 901.\n\n22\n00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:01.163\nGo back and\n\n23\n00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:05.164\nwe've talked about some of the different\nhardware issues that you can see.\n\n24\n00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:09.420\nAnd this is really where you can tie\nit together with our operating system\n\n25\n00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.060\nutility.\n\n26\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.800\nSo one of the things that I\nkinda wanna recommend as well\n\n27\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.040\nis it doesn't matter if you're taking\nthe 901 or the 902 exam, watch them both.\n\n28\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360\nWatch them both before you take\neither exam because again, hardware,\n\n29\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.720\nyou know how to troubleshoot hardware.\n\n30\n00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.970\nA lot of times, you need your software.\n\n31\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.000\nIf something goes wrong with\nyour software, a lot of times,\n\n32\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.500\nit's your hardware, so\nthey kinda run hand in hand.\n\n33\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.874\nI don't know about the chicken or\nthe egg syndrome here that's going on, but\n\n34\n00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:38.280\none usually necessitates the other, so-\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, you don't have a chicken or\n\n35\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.002\nan egg inside your hardware.\n\n36\n00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH] that's right for\nsure, so let's go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:42.474 --> 00:01:44.210\nwe're gonna dive right back in.\n\n38\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.160\nRemember, in the first part,\n\n39\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.290\nwe were really talking about things\nlike your proprietary crash screens.\n\n40\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.220\nWe talked about the BSOD or\nthe blue screen of death.\n\n41\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.590\nPin wheel is something that you see\nmore in the Mac operating systems.\n\n42\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.218\nAnd we'll definitely be looking\nin other episodes into the Mac\n\n43\n00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:01.720\noperating system and\nbriefly in Linux as well.\n\n44\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.900\nWe also talked about failure to boot.\n\n45\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.788\nAgain, we were talking\nabout some of the things.\n\n46\n00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:10.039\nIt can be the problem there, problematic\nis an incorrect boot sequence set\n\n47\n00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.220\nin the UEFI,\nunified extensive firmware innovation.\n\n48\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.390\nRemember, they're both firmware platforms,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.785\nOne's older, then the one's the newer one,\nif you will.\n\n50\n00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:21.839\nIt could be a USB device, non-bootable\ndevice that's plugged into a USB port and\n\n51\n00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.204\nthe operating system's looking for\nthe mask.\n\n52\n00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:26.761\nOr not the operating system,\nbut the UEFI or\n\n53\n00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:31.290\nthe BIOS is looking for that master\nboot record there and isn't finding it.\n\n54\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.450\nImproper shutdowns,\nspontaneous shutdowns and reboots, right,\n\n55\n00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.500\nall of this can happen.\n\n56\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500\nAnd what we left you with\nwas really booting into\n\n57\n00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.200\nthings like our system recovery options,\nright, or our system recovery environment.\n\n58\n00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.640\nAnd well, there might be a couple of\nreasons that this happens, right?\n\n59\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.970\nWe talked about the boot sequence,\n\n60\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.720\nso you can kinda understand\nhow the boot sequence goes.\n\n61\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.210\nWe'll recap that real quick, go back and\n\n62\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.695\nwatch the first part of you want\na little more in-depth, right?\n\n63\n00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:01.347\nBOOTMGR, it looks for the Winload.exe,\n\n64\n00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:05.312\nthat turns around and\nlooks for the ntoskrnl.\n\n65\n00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:08.110\nDo keep that in mind that\nthat's the normal boot process.\n\n66\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.230\nEvery time the boot process happens,\nthe recovery environment flag is set.\n\n67\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.310\nThe moment you log into\nthe operating system,\n\n68\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.080\nthat's when the boot process\nhas successfully finished.\n\n69\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.770\nAnd it's not until that happens that\nyour boot process has finished, right?\n\n70\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.122\nSo if you don't get to boot into your\noperating system, then the next time it\n\n71\n00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:32.953\nreboots, what's gonna happen is the boot\nmanager is gonna see that recovery flag.\n\n72\n00:03:32.953 --> 00:03:36.017\nAnd it's gonna throw you one of the screen\nwhere we left off with at the last\n\n73\n00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:37.709\nepisode, this one right here, right?\n\n74\n00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.220\nSo we have the recovery options, right?\n\n75\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.090\nAnd notice, it says, It looks like\nWindows didn't load correctly, right?\n\n76\n00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.610\nIt says, do you wanna try again?\n\n77\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.430\nAnd you can try again, I'm not gonna\ntry again because, in all fairness,\n\n78\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.040\nWindows is going to reboot itself.\n\n79\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.580\nA lot of times,\nit'll reboot itself just fine, right?\n\n80\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.678\nIt'll clear out anything that's\ncached in the background and\n\n81\n00:03:56.678 --> 00:03:57.640\nit'll boot successfully.\n\n82\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.515\nBut we wanna show you some of\nthe advanced repair options.\n\n83\n00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:03.120\nAnd again, these could be in things,\n\n84\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.280\nyou could do this through a repair disk as\nwell if you have your installation disk.\n\n85\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.965\nOr you've create the repair disk inside\nof the Window's operating system,\n\n86\n00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:16.040\nit'll get you to the same location.\n\n87\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.599\nIt's nice that Windows has it built-in\ntoday, so that it's a fail over, right?\n\n88\n00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.681\nZach, you mentioned that on the first\npart, that it's kinda like a fail safe,\n\n89\n00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:23.190\nif you will.\n\n90\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.770\nSo let's go ahead, and we're gonna show\nyou, let's show you what the recovery\n\n91\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.670\nenvironment and\nthe recovery options stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.093\nAgain, we could continue to Windows 8.1,\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:36.742\nI don't wanna do that because this will\nbe a very short episode [LAUGH] if I do.\n\n94\n00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:40.699\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it says, Troubleshoot your PC.\n\n95\n00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.284\nNotice it says, Reset of refresh your PC.\n\n96\n00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.270\nThat's another thing that you can do,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.400\nReset, this is kinda like your\nreinstall repair option, right?\n\n98\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.030\nIf you will,\nyou can essentially reinstall Windows,\n\n99\n00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.960\nkeeping all of your files and\nfolders in place.\n\n100\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.191\nOr if you want to completely\nreset your PC or refresh,\n\n101\n00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.831\nlet me make sure I get this right.\n\n102\n00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.871\nReset your PC means,\nlet's reinstall the operating system.\n\n103\n00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:14.710\nLet's keep your files where they are and\nintact.\n\n104\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.210\nOr you can refresh your PC, and\nwhat this does is you lose your files and\n\n105\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.050\nyou reinstall a fresh instance of Windows.\n\n106\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.010\nNow, how does this benefit you, all right?\n\n107\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.141\nMake sure, again, reset,\nremove all of your files.\n\n108\n00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:33.210\nAnd I had that backwards,\nI always get that backwards, right?\n\n109\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.942\nReset is to completely\nremove all of your files.\n\n110\n00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:39.080\nRefresh says, hey, you can refresh it,\nbut you keep your files.\n\n111\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.240\nNow, why would I do one over the other?\n\n112\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.610\nAll right, well, if I do a refresh, right?\n\n113\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.434\nAnd what I don't do is remove my files,\nsometimes, viruses, sometimes,\n\n114\n00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:48.450\nbugs, sometimes,\n\n115\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.941\nthings that cause file corruption\nactually sit in the user profile.\n\n116\n00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.370\nThe user profile are where my files are,\nincluding things like temporary files.\n\n117\n00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.512\nWell, if I don't remove those, they could\nbe the thing that's causing the problem.\n\n118\n00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:05.770\nSo it's also one of the less invasive\nmethods, so I would start here.\n\n119\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.690\nAnd if that doesn't work, then you say,\nwell, hopefully, you've run backups.\n\n120\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.207\nAnd if you haven't,\ncheck out our backup episodes, right?\n\n121\n00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:15.913\nIt's part of system maintenance, and\nthat's why you wanna maintain it because-\n\n122\n00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:17.570\n&gt;&gt; Back does everything.\n\n123\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.520\n&gt;&gt; Everything, that's right.\n\n124\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.940\nSo if you wanna reset your PC,\n\n125\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.860\nthen what you can do is you\nremove all of your files.\n\n126\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.760\nAnd then you can actually import\nall of the files from backups\n\n127\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.810\nback into your machine.\n\n128\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.915\nSo but again, with the reset, you're gonna\nlose everything, so do keep that in mind.\n\n129\n00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:35.935\nAll right, now,\n\n130\n00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:40.368\nthe other thing that I wanna look at is\nthe Advanced options here, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:40.368 --> 00:06:42.952\nAnd there are a few different\nthings that we can run.\n\n132\n00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:46.569\nAll right, one of the things that we can\nrun is what's known as the system restore,\n\n133\n00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:47.098\nall right?\n\n134\n00:06:47.098 --> 00:06:51.350\nIf we run a system restore, this is\nwhere we have to have a restore point.\n\n135\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.650\nLet me see,\nI\"m not sure if this has a restore point.\n\n136\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.211\nBut let me go ahead,\nwe're gonna actually run.\n\n137\n00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:58.470\nAnd it requires me to\nactually login as the admin.\n\n138\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.520\nThat is required because you're\nessentially gonna open up\n\n139\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.270\nfiles that are in the operating system.\n\n140\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.225\nSo you do have to authenticate, and-\n&gt;&gt; And Wes,\n\n141\n00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:10.040\nthis is where you can choose a backup\ntime, a time and date maybe?\n\n142\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.780\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nvery good memory, that's right.\n\n143\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.030\nThat's exactly what it is, Zach.\n\n144\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.410\nThis is going to set you to\nan earlier configuration point.\n\n145\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.410\nAnd honestly, ladies and gentlemen,\nI can't remember if we installed a driver.\n\n146\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.019\nI'm pretty sure we have a backup point\nbecause I have done some Windows updates\n\n147\n00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:26.848\nto this machine.\n\n148\n00:07:26.848 --> 00:07:31.680\nAnd when you do Windows updates,\nit creates an automatic restore point.\n\n149\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.600\nSo I'm pretty sure, yeah, there we go.\n\n150\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.990\nYep, and like I said,\nWindows updates when it runs.\n\n151\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.686\nSo I could restore my machine if I needed\nto turn earlier point in time using\n\n152\n00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:44.368\nthe system restore here.\n\n153\n00:07:44.368 --> 00:07:49.002\nNow, I'll save that for another day,\njust wanted you to know that it's there.\n\n154\n00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:52.551\nSo I'll cancel out of that and\nI'll go back into my troubleshoot, and\n\n155\n00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:54.431\nI wanna go into my advanced options.\n\n156\n00:07:54.431 --> 00:08:00.614\n&gt;&gt; Back in the olden days that had gateway\ngo back Yeah, I used to use that often.\n\n157\n00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:05.150\n&gt;&gt; And really Zach, you're right because\nin the earlier days of Windows you would\n\n158\n00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.648\ngo to a lot of these\nthird party utilities.\n\n159\n00:08:07.648 --> 00:08:12.070\nAnd I'd have to go and have to pay\na manufacture, a software manufacturer.\n\n160\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.640\nI have to go to somebody else, right?\n\n161\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.140\nAnd then, I would have to pay the price\nto get their software that I could\n\n162\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.580\nthen use in order to recover Windows.\n\n163\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.270\nWell, I have to say Microsoft got very,\nvery smart.\n\n164\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.630\nAnd what they said is you know what?\n\n165\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.620\nRather than having to go to a third party\nto take care of this, we'll go ahead and\n\n166\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.530\nwe'll bundle some of this functionality\ninto the operating system itself.\n\n167\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.010\nNow you don't have to\ngo to the third party.\n\n168\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.375\nSo the other thing I wanna look at too in\nsome of the other system recovery options\n\n169\n00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.341\nthat we have is the Startup Repair.\n\n170\n00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:47.984\nNow with the Startup Repair one of\nthe things we can do is we can actually\n\n171\n00:08:47.984 --> 00:08:51.382\nallow Windows to automatically\ntry to fix things.\n\n172\n00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:57.664\nAnd if you'll notice it says Fix\nproblems that keep Windows from loading.\n\n173\n00:08:57.664 --> 00:08:59.100\nAnd that's sometimes important.\n\n174\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.960\nSometimes you'll have things like your\nboot configuration data is missing.\n\n175\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.390\nI'm gonna show you a little\nbit more about that,\n\n176\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.730\ncuz they called that out here\non the exam objectives too.\n\n177\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.502\nBut it's BCD, boot configuration data.\n\n178\n00:09:10.502 --> 00:09:15.090\nEssentially is the settings that\ndefine how the operating system loads.\n\n179\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.370\nSo when the boot loader and all that\nboot process that we're talking about\n\n180\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.220\nneeds to know,\nwhat's the operating system I load?\n\n181\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.040\nWhere do I find bootmgr?\n\n182\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.030\nWhere do I find winload.exe?\n\n183\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.464\nI gotta find it on the hard drive,\n\n184\n00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:30.980\nit looks to the boot configuration\ndata to find that information out.\n\n185\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.840\nIt's a couple of different\nways that we can do this.\n\n186\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.120\nWe can allow Windows to try to\nfix the problem automatically and\n\n187\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.628\nit'll do its startup repair.\n\n188\n00:09:39.628 --> 00:09:44.460\nThe other thing which is what I'd like to\nshow you with missing boot configuration\n\n189\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:50.260\nis we're gonna go to the command prompt,\nand that's up here too.\n\n190\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.195\nNow the other thing that can happen too,\n\n191\n00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:56.830\nit could say the missing operating system,\ntoo.\n\n192\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.530\nA missing operating system might not\nbe the fact that the operating system's\n\n193\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.730\nmissing at all.\n\n194\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.348\nRemember with boot configuration data,\nit points you to the winload.exe and\n\n195\n00:10:06.348 --> 00:10:10.560\nthe winload.exe turns around and\nfinds the kernel.\n\n196\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.230\nWell, guess what?\n\n197\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.760\nIf bootmgr can't find winload,\nyou can't find the operating system,\n\n198\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.180\nyou get the missing operating system.\n\n199\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.060\nSo startup repair can\nsometimes fix this as well.\n\n200\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.540\nSo let me go ahead and show you some of\nthe other things that you can do too.\n\n201\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.530\nSo for instance command prompt,\nI can launch into a command prompt.\n\n202\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.080\nNow I apologize ahead of time.\n\n203\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.120\nUsually what I like to do beforehand\nis I like to adjust the fonts here so\n\n204\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.040\nyou guys can see these a little bit,\nit's not in satellite view.\n\n205\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.360\nBut being that this is\na pre-installation environment,\n\n206\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.490\nthere's no way to set this ahead of time.\n\n207\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.060\nKeep in mind that this is what I've talked\nabout in other episodes as being a memory\n\n208\n00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.490\nresident operating system.\n\n209\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.950\nSo it's only running in RAM at\nthe time that I boot into it, so\n\n210\n00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.017\nI'll have to do a minor adjustment here.\n\n211\n00:10:56.017 --> 00:10:59.510\nAnd again, I do apologize ahead of time\nfor having to do this live on camera.\n\n212\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.930\nBut at least you guys\nwill see how to do it.\n\n213\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.210\n&gt;&gt; Live action debugging.\n\n214\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so we're gonna go ahead,\n\n215\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.990\nwe'll give you a little\nbit more real estate.\n\n216\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.580\nRemember, we've talked about\ncommand prompt in other episodes.\n\n217\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.440\nWe're gonna do a cd\\ here in CLS.\n\n218\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.130\nWe'll clear the screen here and\nkinda give it something to work with.\n\n219\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.320\nNow, if you end up having problems\nwith the operating system,\n\n220\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.110\nyou could run something known as bcdedit\n\n221\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.760\nto see if you can find\nyour operating system.\n\n222\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.620\nNow, bcdedit allows you, with the enum\noption, it's short for enumeration,\n\n223\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.450\nit says hey, I wanna see the BCD.\n\n224\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.300\nNow you'll notice,\n\n225\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.900\nlook at these files that I was telling\nyou about as part of the boot process.\n\n226\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.250\nI mentioned Windows Boot Manager, right?\n\n227\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.790\nWell, here's the Windows Boot Manager.\n\n228\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.640\nHere's what we're talking about,\nbootmgr, right?\n\n229\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.850\nThe bootmgr, it shows me that\nthe Boot Manager is on partition C.\n\n230\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.210\nIt is present, and it is ready to go.\n\n231\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.120\nWell, remember I told you\nthe boot loader as well?\n\n232\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.510\nWell, look at the boot loader.\n\n233\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.410\nWhat is it called?\n\n234\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.964\nWell, here's the Windows Boot Loader and\n\n235\n00:12:02.964 --> 00:12:07.812\nit is in windows\\system32\\ and\nwe see winload.exe.\n\n236\n00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:09.189\nSo this is what's gonna look for\n\n237\n00:12:09.189 --> 00:12:11.750\nthe kernel to find it to\nbootstrap the operating system.\n\n238\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.260\nSo I can see that it is there.\n\n239\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.470\nNow, if I needed to fix it.\n\n240\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.440\nIf I knew that maybe there was\nsomething messed up with this, right?\n\n241\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.240\nSome kind of problem,\nI get the missing operating system.\n\n242\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.820\nWell, I can actually, I'm just gonna clear\nthe screen here, I can run something, and\n\n243\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.940\nyou have to do this from\nthe system recovery options.\n\n244\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.710\nI'll let you know, bcdedit is in\nthe operating system by default.\n\n245\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.230\nIt is a tool that you can find.\n\n246\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.000\nThis next one is only in\nthe system recovery options,\n\n247\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.085\nit is not native to the Windows command\nprompt and that's called bootrec.\n\n248\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:52.190\nSo bootrec, and if I do a /?,\nactually I know what I want,\n\n249\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:59.790\nI could just type rebuildbcd and that\nwould fix the boot configuration data.\n\n250\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.720\nThat's one of the great things.\n\n251\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.870\nIt's a boot recovery, right?.\n\n252\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.130\nIt's part of the system recovery options,\nbut let's just show you again, as well.\n\n253\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.150\nMaybe the master boot record, the BIOS,\n\n254\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.830\ndoesn't find the master boot record, and\nI need to repair the master boot record.\n\n255\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.490\nWell, if I run my bootrec /?, here,\n\n256\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:20.230\nyou can see that I do get an option that\nsays, /Fixmbr and we could run that.\n\n257\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.145\nI could do a bootrec / and\n\n258\n00:13:25.145 --> 00:13:29.362\nwe could do a fixmbr.\n\n259\n00:13:29.362 --> 00:13:33.400\nAnd just that quick,\nit fixes the master boot record.\n\n260\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.980\nNow, what if the boot\npartition needs fixed.\n\n261\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.470\nSo the master boot record defines how we\nboot the operator that's the boot code,\n\n262\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.190\nbut if the container that holds\nthe boot code we have a problem?\n\n263\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.020\nWell, I can fix that as well, right?\n\n264\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.765\nI can run the same utility instead of\nrunning fixmbr, I can run a fixboot.\n\n265\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.980\nAnd very, very easy, right?\n\n266\n00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.801\nThese things run really quick [SOUND]\nwe're talking about very small text files.\n\n267\n00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:04.986\nBut then I can also run if it's the boot\nconfiguration data I can run rebuildbcd.\n\n268\n00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:10.449\nNow, notice that it took a second, right?\n\n269\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:16.580\nSo and it told me total identified\noperation system installation 0, right?\n\n270\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:22.770\nYou'll see that if it finds an operating\nsystem that isn't already located in\n\n271\n00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:28.200\nthe BCD again, missing operating system,\nyou'll find that result here, it'll say 1.\n\n272\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.860\nAnd this might seem a little confusing\ncuz it says total identifying operating\n\n273\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.422\nsystem 0.\n\n274\n00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:36.136\nWell, operating systems that\naren't already listed in the boot\n\n275\n00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:37.423\nconfiguration data.\n\n276\n00:14:37.423 --> 00:14:41.060\nWell, it says 0 that means boot\nconfiguration data is just fine.\n\n277\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.521\nNow I believe there's a scan\nOS as well on here too so\n\n278\n00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:49.042\njust kinda mention that cause we\nmentioned all the other ones too.\n\n279\n00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:52.650\nSo that's a little bit about\nwhat you can do with bootrec.\n\n280\n00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.838\nNow there is another one that I wanna\nmention too some of the tools that they\n\n281\n00:14:55.838 --> 00:14:57.853\ncall out and\nthat's the system file checker.\n\n282\n00:14:57.853 --> 00:15:01.395\nAnd tell you what let me clear\nthe screen here get back at the top so\n\n283\n00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:03.210\nyou guys can see this.\n\n284\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.880\nAgain, I apologize kind of ahead of time\nfor this matted screen here, cuz remember,\n\n285\n00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.930\nwe are in a memory\nresident operating system.\n\n286\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.270\nBut we have what's known as the sfc.\n\n287\n00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.830\nNow sfc is a little bit\ndifferent than check disk.\n\n288\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.237\nRemember check disk, C-H-K-D-S-K,\n\n289\n00:15:18.237 --> 00:15:23.810\nthat checks the logical integrity of\nthe entire file system, all files.\n\n290\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.031\nsfc, don't let it confuse you on the exam,\nthat's system file checker,\n\n291\n00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:30.045\nit doesn't care about your files.\n\n292\n00:15:30.045 --> 00:15:33.980\nIt doesn't care about other\nfiles that aren't system files.\n\n293\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.310\nsfc, we end up repairing\njust your system files.\n\n294\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:43.530\nAnd you might have to run it,\nso you would run sfc /scannow.\n\n295\n00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.631\nAnd it does.\n\n296\n00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:47.705\nNow, notice that it tells me, and\nlet's be careful with this one, and\n\n297\n00:15:47.705 --> 00:15:49.819\nI'll show you another way\nthat you can run this.\n\n298\n00:15:49.819 --> 00:15:51.209\nNotice that is says,\n\n299\n00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:55.930\nthere is a system repair pending,\nwhich requires a reboot to complete.\n\n300\n00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.974\nKeep in mind That we have certain flags\nthat are being set in the boot process\n\n301\n00:15:59.974 --> 00:16:03.184\nright now that might run\ncontrary to a diagnostic program,\n\n302\n00:16:03.184 --> 00:16:06.480\nnot allowing it to run and\nthat's what you're seeing here.\n\n303\n00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.940\nSo what it's letting you know\nis that restart your machine,\n\n304\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.340\nboot into your machine, and then run\nsfc and it will restart the machine and\n\n305\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.305\nit will do a system.\n\n306\n00:16:16.305 --> 00:16:18.980\nIt'll run the system file checker,\nI'll show you guys that in a second.\n\n307\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.540\nAll right, so that's something that\nsometimes can cause problems as well.\n\n308\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.800\nNow, the other thing that you can do and\nlet me go ahead and close that down.\n\n309\n00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.990\nThe other thing that you can do here\nis in the recovery options, here we go.\n\n310\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.665\nYou can also boot into\nwhat's known as Safe Mode.\n\n311\n00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:38.619\nAll right, now there's a couple of\nthings that you gotta keep in mind.\n\n312\n00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:41.136\nThis might happen automatically.\n\n313\n00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:45.222\nIf it happens automatically,\nchances are an MS config, you've run\n\n314\n00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:49.307\ninto a diagnostic mode and you've set\nit and forgot that you set it and\n\n315\n00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:52.701\nwhen we restarted the machine,\nit boots into safe mode.\n\n316\n00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:56.557\nRemember that, like we've said\nabout MS Config in other episodes,\n\n317\n00:16:56.557 --> 00:17:01.011\nif you boot into safe mode through MS\nConfig, it is persistent across reboots,\n\n318\n00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:04.075\nwhich means you have to go\nback in there and turn it off.\n\n319\n00:17:04.075 --> 00:17:07.180\nWith the system recovery options here,\nit's only a one time deal.\n\n320\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.940\nIf I reboot this machine and\nI don't go back into the recovery options,\n\n321\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.081\nI'm not gonna boot back into safe mode.\n\n322\n00:17:13.081 --> 00:17:14.545\nLet me show you guys how\nyou can do that too.\n\n323\n00:17:14.545 --> 00:17:19.111\nSo, Startup Settings here, we're gonna go\nahead we're gonna choose that all right.\n\n324\n00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:22.064\nAnd notice it's gonna Restart\nto change Windows options.\n\n325\n00:17:22.064 --> 00:17:26.229\nAnd this is actually modifying\nthe BCD a little bit all right.\n\n326\n00:17:26.229 --> 00:17:28.910\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll let this machine reboot.\n\n327\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.957\nAll right, and now you'll notice\nthat we have some options here.\n\n328\n00:17:31.957 --> 00:17:36.597\nAll right, now we've got a couple\nthings that we can do all right.\n\n329\n00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:39.900\nWe can boot into low resolution\nmode if we want, right?\n\n330\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.030\nSo if we're having, there might be\na couple reasons that you might do this.\n\n331\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.700\nSo for instance, notice that there's\nan Enable Safe Mode with Command Prompt.\n\n332\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.970\nIf you have a missing\ngraphical user interface,\n\n333\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.850\nthat could be a tell tale sign that\nsomething's wrong with your video card.\n\n334\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.016\nCould be a video driver that's\ncausing it as well, right?\n\n335\n00:17:57.016 --> 00:18:00.282\nBecause of that,\nI just needed to see the command prompt.\n\n336\n00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:03.021\nI know something is wrong with\nthe graphical user interface it's\n\n337\n00:18:03.021 --> 00:18:03.776\nfailing to load.\n\n338\n00:18:03.776 --> 00:18:08.055\nIt doesn't load the graphical user\ninterface it's failing altogether.\n\n339\n00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:09.230\nSo what happens?\n\n340\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.650\nWell, I can boot into command prompt.\n\n341\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.239\nI get the text editor and\nit's Windows without the GUI,\n\n342\n00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:15.124\nwithout the graphical user interface.\n\n343\n00:18:15.124 --> 00:18:19.382\nAnd that could be something\nthat you wanna do.\n\n344\n00:18:19.382 --> 00:18:24.212\nA couple of reasons, either missing the\ngraphical user interface if you will, or\n\n345\n00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:26.530\nfailing to even load it.\n\n346\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.605\nIn this case we're just gonna go ahead and\n\n347\n00:18:28.605 --> 00:18:31.346\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna enable safe mode.\n\n348\n00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:35.809\nNow you gotta be careful,\nbecause when we enable safe mode,\n\n349\n00:18:35.809 --> 00:18:39.321\ncertain services will\nfail to start all right.\n\n350\n00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:41.781\nAnd I'll talk a little bit more\nabout how that could be good and\n\n351\n00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:43.280\nhow that could be bad.\n\n352\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.399\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose el numero 4 all right.\n\n353\n00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:51.400\nAnd we gonna launch into safe mode.\n\n354\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.065\nNow, when we launch into safe mode,\nwhat is safe mode?\n\n355\n00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:56.355\nWell safe mode,\nyou are still booting Windows.\n\n356\n00:18:56.355 --> 00:18:58.540\nAll right now again,\nI apologize ahead of time.\n\n357\n00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.800\nNotice we had some math here.\n\n358\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.820\nThat's because we're not loading\nthe graphical user interface drivers.\n\n359\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.740\nThey're gonna fail to boot.\n\n360\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.490\nIt's gonna fail to load\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n361\n00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.297\nbecause I might want to be fixing the GUI.\n\n362\n00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:16.225\nAnd in this case, what Windows is doing,\nis it's saying hey,\n\n363\n00:19:16.225 --> 00:19:18.840\nI'm not gonna load your graphics driver.\n\n364\n00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.760\nI'm gonna give you a generic VGA driver,\nright?\n\n365\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.780\nAnd that's just generic, runs with all\ndevices, so that if the driver to your\n\n366\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.550\ngraphics card is causing the problem,\nyou can actually see that here.\n\n367\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.640\nAll right, at least work with\nyour operating system I mean.\n\n368\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.273\nAll right so\n\n369\n00:19:36.273 --> 00:19:40.592\nnotice that we can see some things that\nare kinda unique to this interface right.\n\n370\n00:19:40.592 --> 00:19:45.804\nThis is how I can tell that\nobviously we're in Safe Mode right.\n\n371\n00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:46.369\n&gt;&gt; Says Safe Mode.\n\n372\n00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:47.949\n&gt;&gt; Says Safe Mode right.\n\n373\n00:19:47.949 --> 00:19:51.273\nNow there are some things that\nwe do have to worry about right.\n\n374\n00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:56.190\nSo if I right-click on our Windows tile,\nand I go to computer management.\n\n375\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.110\nI wanna show you some of the things that\ncan happen with your services, all right?\n\n376\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.181\nSometimes services will fail to start.\n\n377\n00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:05.189\nThis could be a good thing,\nit could be a bad thing.\n\n378\n00:20:05.189 --> 00:20:08.500\nIn this case, it's a good thing,\nbecause we're the ones that are doing it.\n\n379\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.320\nWe are saying anything that\nisn't required to start Windows\n\n380\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.060\nisn't necessary in\na diagnostic purpose right?\n\n381\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.800\nLet me show you an example.\n\n382\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.020\nBy default automatically inside\nof Windows the principle or\n\n383\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.410\nservice starts up automatically and runs.\n\n384\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.940\nIf I'm fixing a computer and\nthat computer's failing to boot, I don't\n\n385\n00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.900\ncare if the print driver is working or\nnot, the print service is working or not.\n\n386\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.460\nSo in safe mode it shuts it down.\n\n387\n00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.229\nWho knows, maybe it's the print\nservice that's causing the problem.\n\n388\n00:20:38.229 --> 00:20:41.687\nWell let's eliminate that and\nat least get you into Windows so\n\n389\n00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:45.390\nthat you can do some kind of diagnostic,\nor fix Windows, right.\n\n390\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.288\nSo let me show you here.\n\n391\n00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:51.419\nSo if I go down to principler, notice\nthat it is an automatic startup type.\n\n392\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.250\nBut notice that it's a Start,\nthat means it stopped, right?\n\n393\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.102\nI can't stop it cuz it's already stopped.\n\n394\n00:20:59.102 --> 00:21:00.840\nWell, that is good, right?\n\n395\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.830\nThat is not a bad thing, right?\n\n396\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.149\nOur graphics driver, right?\n\n397\n00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:08.037\nThe graphics card,\nit isn't loaded either because again,\n\n398\n00:21:08.037 --> 00:21:10.481\nit could be the thing\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n399\n00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:14.330\nIt could be the reason we needed to\nbooth into safe mode to begin with.\n\n400\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.980\nWell, if it's causing the problem, and\n\n401\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:21.300\nit isn't necessary to run the operating\nsystem, let's don't include it.\n\n402\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.751\nLet's not start it up.\n\n403\n00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:25.470\nSo again, that could be a device\nfailing to start, right.\n\n404\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.950\nThe device that's failing to start is\nyour graphics card, but that's okay.\n\n405\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.840\nRight, that's fine.\n\n406\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.150\nAnd more appropriately it's actually\nthe driver that's failing to load.\n\n407\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.680\nLet me also show you\nsigns of that as well.\n\n408\n00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.642\nSo if I right click on my Windows charm\nhere, and I go into device manager,\n\n409\n00:21:40.642 --> 00:21:43.456\nyou should see inside of device manager.\n\n410\n00:21:43.456 --> 00:21:48.980\nNotice my monitors here,\nit says Generic Non-PnP Monitor.\n\n411\n00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.660\nAnd it's giving me this it\nsays status not available for\n\n412\n00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.080\nthis device when Windows\nis running in Safe Mode.\n\n413\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.790\nWell it's okay,\nI don't really care about that, right?\n\n414\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.240\nThat driver isn't loading\nto the graphics card,\n\n415\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.370\nnotice what is loading\nBasic Display Driver, right?\n\n416\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.450\nAgain it's giving me the ability to\neliminate things that aren't necessary\n\n417\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.190\nto run the Operating System so\nat least I can get Windows started so\n\n418\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.480\nI can come in here and\nI can do some diagnostics all right.\n\n419\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.144\nThe other thing we can do\ntoo is we can also and\n\n420\n00:22:23.144 --> 00:22:25.960\nwhile I'm in here I'll go ahead and\nrun this.\n\n421\n00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.967\nIf I go through the run I can\nactually type msconfig.exe, and\n\n422\n00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:36.950\nhere is your MSConfig or your system\nconfiguration utility, all right?\n\n423\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:42.890\nNow notice that MSConfig right now is\nset for a normal startup type, right?\n\n424\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.460\nLoad all device drivers and services.\n\n425\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.350\nWell, you can see we're in safe mode.\n\n426\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.540\nWhat's going on here?\n\n427\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.590\nWell, we actually modified the VCD.\n\n428\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.960\nAll right, we told the boot configuration\nnow this is how we want you to boot.\n\n429\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.470\nWe didn't modify the system configuration.\n\n430\n00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.568\nSo this is temporary what we're doing now.\n\n431\n00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:05.600\nYou might boot into safe mode, right?\n\n432\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.450\nAnd that could be an accident in the fact\nthat your boot is set to Safe boot,\n\n433\n00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.060\nMinimal all right, now it seems cryptic.\n\n434\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.180\nBut that's essentially\nbooting the Safe Mode.\n\n435\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.630\nThat will do exactly the same\nthing that you see right here, but\n\n436\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.600\nyou've done it yourself inside\nof the operating system for\n\n437\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.640\nthe purposes of diagnosing a driver\nthat might be a little bit problematic.\n\n438\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.760\nMaybe not serious enough\nthat it's rebooting or\n\n439\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.650\nblue screening the machine, but it is\ngiving you maybe some quirky resolution.\n\n440\n00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.180\nYou're like well let me see\nif I can diagnosis this.\n\n441\n00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.758\nI can still get into Windows but\nlet me see if I can eliminate that right,\n\n442\n00:23:40.758 --> 00:23:42.550\nprocess of elimination.\n\n443\n00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.168\nSo I can come in here and\nI can launch MSConfig and\n\n444\n00:23:46.168 --> 00:23:50.256\nwhat I can do is actually\nmanually define a safe boot.\n\n445\n00:23:50.256 --> 00:23:52.698\nAlternate shell would just do safe boot,\nor\n\n446\n00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:55.076\nsafe mode if you will with command prompt.\n\n447\n00:23:55.076 --> 00:23:57.179\nDon't worry about Active Directory repair.\n\n448\n00:23:57.179 --> 00:23:59.024\nWe're not worried about that for\nthis exam.\n\n449\n00:23:59.024 --> 00:24:04.852\nNetwork does safe mode and\ninitiates the network adapter.\n\n450\n00:24:04.852 --> 00:24:07.951\nThese first two,\nyour network adapter will not turn on,\n\n451\n00:24:07.951 --> 00:24:09.652\nthe device will fail to start.\n\n452\n00:24:09.652 --> 00:24:13.890\nAll right, again, because maybe it's your\nnetwork driver that's causing the problem,\n\n453\n00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.540\nmaybe it's your network stack, maybe\nit's the network TCPIP protocol stack\n\n454\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.270\nthat might be causing the problem or\nthe reason you're not even getting network\n\n455\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.600\nconfigurations at all\ncould be the problem.\n\n456\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.451\nOr might have nothing to\ndo with the network driver.\n\n457\n00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:29.669\nMaybe the fact of the matter is,\nyou wanna boot into safe mode,\n\n458\n00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:33.984\nget your operating system loaded, and have\nthe network adapter loaded up so that you\n\n459\n00:24:33.984 --> 00:24:38.363\ncan connect to the manufacturer's website\neven through this low resolution mode and\n\n460\n00:24:38.363 --> 00:24:41.995\nactually pull down an updated,\nnon-corrupted and fix the problem.\n\n461\n00:24:41.995 --> 00:24:46.113\nYou install the driver, you unleash out\npermission, you're no longer in safe mode\n\n462\n00:24:46.113 --> 00:24:49.193\nand, you're good to go,\nat least we hope so that's the goal.\n\n463\n00:24:49.193 --> 00:24:54.345\nAll right, so that is a couple of\nthings that you could see inside of\n\n464\n00:24:54.345 --> 00:25:00.030\nyour operating systems as well when\nit comes to booting in the safe mode.\n\n465\n00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:04.250\nNow there's one last thing\nthat I kinda wanna tackle\n\n466\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.920\nhere inside of our operating system.\n\n467\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.460\nAnd I'm gonna have to try,\n\n468\n00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.880\nlet's see if I can try this inside\nof our system recovery options.\n\n469\n00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.470\nI tell you what we're gonna do.\n\n470\n00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.142\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n471\n00:25:17.142 --> 00:25:22.781\nI'm going to I'm gonna see if I can\nactually get into the recovery options.\n\n472\n00:25:22.781 --> 00:25:24.005\nYeah, I'll tell you what, we're gonna go.\n\n473\n00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:25.975\nLet me show you in Windows 8.\n\n474\n00:25:25.975 --> 00:25:27.784\nI don't know if we get\nour charms menu here.\n\n475\n00:25:27.784 --> 00:25:28.910\nYeah, we still get our charms menu.\n\n476\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.962\nSometimes it eliminates some of the things\nthat you can do, even in Windows.\n\n477\n00:25:31.962 --> 00:25:34.480\nI wanna show you how you can get\ninto the recovery environment, and\n\n478\n00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.840\nyou can actually force the machine\ninto the recovery environment.\n\n479\n00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.342\nRather than having to do what I did in the\nfirst episode where I was spontaneously\n\n480\n00:25:41.342 --> 00:25:43.393\nrebooting the machine\nto create the problem.\n\n481\n00:25:43.393 --> 00:25:46.882\nI can actually force it to\ngo into recovery mode and\n\n482\n00:25:46.882 --> 00:25:52.550\nfrom the recovery option and I went to the\ncharms menu I know I did that kinda fast.\n\n483\n00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:57.395\nPC settings, that's right update recovery,\nand then from here,\n\n484\n00:25:57.395 --> 00:26:01.900\nI can go into recovery and\nthere is the advanced startup here and\n\n485\n00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.790\nwe'll go ahead and we'll restart now.\n\n486\n00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.292\nAnd notice what it did, it takes us right\ninto that troubleshooting environment.\n\n487\n00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:11.634\nI wanna show another thing that\nmight happen, this is very,\n\n488\n00:26:11.634 --> 00:26:14.070\nvery hard to recreate today.\n\n489\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.300\nAny of you guys that have been in\nWindows going back to the earlier 90's,\n\n490\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.980\nWindows 95, Windows 98 as well, might have\nseen that this problem won't happen and\n\n491\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.880\nthat's something known as a missing DLL.\n\n492\n00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.219\nA missing DLL, what happened,\nis when you're uninstalling one's piece of\n\n493\n00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:32.957\nsoftware and it removes a common\nDLL that's actually used by other\n\n494\n00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:38.053\napplications, cuz it's thinking it's the\nonly thing there that's actually using it.\n\n495\n00:26:38.053 --> 00:26:40.611\nAnd when you uninstall that application,\n\n496\n00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:44.102\nit takes a deal that two other\napplications needed to use.\n\n497\n00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:46.003\n&gt;&gt; Well you know Wes, I'm an old guy.\n\n498\n00:26:46.003 --> 00:26:49.680\nAnd I wanted to ask you about this and\nI think you might be leading up to that.\n\n499\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.420\nBut, defrag?\n\n500\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, defrag is gonna be one\nthat we're gonna go ahead and\n\n501\n00:26:53.429 --> 00:26:56.149\nwe're probably gonna have to save this\none unfortunately, for a part three.\n\n502\n00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:57.710\nBecause we got some other\nthings to talk about.\n\n503\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.898\nBut Zack I do wanna just kinda mention,\n\n504\n00:26:59.898 --> 00:27:03.357\none last thing about what I was\ntalking about the DLL message.\n\n505\n00:27:03.357 --> 00:27:06.560\nThis one's hard to recreate here.\n\n506\n00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.740\nIn fact I've tried before and\n\n507\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.420\nsometimes I can get, in a recovery mode\nwhere I try to launch windows explorer.\n\n508\n00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.420\nFrom a recovery mode, and the permission\nsets doesn't allow it to go down and\n\n509\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.580\ngrab the dill file.\n\n510\n00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.870\nBut a lot of times that doesn't even\nwork to try to replicate it and\n\n511\n00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.270\nshow you guys that,\nsometimes when you have a missing\n\n512\n00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:28.480\nDLL you don't even know that it's going\non and you don't get a message anymore.\n\n513\n00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:34.440\nEarlier back like I was saying in the 90s\nwith Windows 95, 98 and stuff like this\n\n514\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.170\nwell, I even read up in Windows 2000\nif you would uninstall that video game,\n\n515\n00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:45.310\nthat was on your PC,\nit would uninstall a common DLL that\n\n516\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:50.330\nsome other application was using, and then\nthat's when you would get the missing DLL.\n\n517\n00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.405\nSometimes today you don't even get\nthat missing DLL file message,\n\n518\n00:27:54.405 --> 00:27:57.058\nin fact let me show you\nhere on the computer.\n\n519\n00:27:57.058 --> 00:28:02.366\nI have deleted purposely again I try\nto create this problem, there are down\n\n520\n00:28:02.366 --> 00:28:08.278\nhere on internet explorer, there are some\nDLLs that are actually missing in here.\n\n521\n00:28:08.278 --> 00:28:11.280\nOne of them I think it's\ncalled like pdm.dll.\n\n522\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.040\nAnd you don't even see the message but\nif I try to launch Windows explorer,\n\n523\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.560\nnotice what's going on here and notice how\nit's kinda, it's not even launching up.\n\n524\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.316\nNotice that we're getting that\nspinning pin wheel, if you will,\n\n525\n00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:25.068\nor cheerio as I like to call it.\n\n526\n00:28:25.068 --> 00:28:26.550\nAnd it's really not doing anything.\n\n527\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.387\nSo you don't even really get\nthe missing DLL message,\n\n528\n00:28:29.387 --> 00:28:32.109\nit's just the fact that it's missing,\nall right?\n\n529\n00:28:32.109 --> 00:28:36.052\nAnd it's causing the application,\nhere, not to function correctly so\n\n530\n00:28:36.052 --> 00:28:40.119\nI wish that I could replicate this for\nyou but this is one of these ones that if\n\n531\n00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:44.602\nit doesn't end up happening, uninstall\nthe application unless it's Windows.\n\n532\n00:28:44.602 --> 00:28:49.076\nYou might have to do, like for\ninstance this is Internet Explorer,\n\n533\n00:28:49.076 --> 00:28:53.240\nyou might have to do a reset of your PC,\nPC refresh or PC reset.\n\n534\n00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.809\nIf it happens to be an application\nthat's looking for a DLL, and\n\n535\n00:28:56.809 --> 00:29:01.170\nyou go launch the application up and\nit says, Missing DLL, chances are all you\n\n536\n00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:06.021\nhad to do was uninstall the application,\nreinstall the application, or do a repair.\n\n537\n00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:11.470\nThat's why they talk about inside of the\nobjectives they say, uninstall, repair.\n\n538\n00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.140\nWhat do they actually call it out here?\n\n539\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.160\nI forgot exactly what they term it here.\n\n540\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.825\nUninstall, reinstall, repair.\n\n541\n00:29:17.825 --> 00:29:20.972\nOkay, so uninstalling the application,\nre-installing it,\n\n542\n00:29:20.972 --> 00:29:22.320\nputs the DLL back in there.\n\n543\n00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.190\nAnd sometimes you can go\nto the program location.\n\n544\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.520\nLet me show you one more time, here.\n\n545\n00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.280\nIf I right click on my Windows tile,\nI go to programs and features,\n\n546\n00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.220\nsometimes you'll see applications.\n\n547\n00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.430\nI wonder if VMWare, yep here we go.\n\n548\n00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:39.080\nSo notice that you have this\noption right you can uninstall it,\n\n549\n00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.230\nbasically you reinstall it, or\nyou can even do a repair function.\n\n550\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.550\nAnd you'll see that a lot of times it'll\nhave its own little dialog box here.\n\n551\n00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.620\nGot a little information, and\nit's gonna ask you what do you wanna do?\n\n552\n00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.940\nSo sometimes that can happen\nwith your missing DLLs.\n\n553\n00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.290\nAgain, it's hard to\ngenerate these messages.\n\n554\n00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.790\nBut, just one last little thing\nI wanna throw in there, and\n\n555\n00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.140\nthat's a great question about defrag.\n\n556\n00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.707\nCuz, we do have to talk about it, but\n\n557\n00:30:01.707 --> 00:30:04.244\nit looks like we're gonna have\nto save this for part three.\n\n558\n00:30:04.244 --> 00:30:07.285\n&gt;&gt; Troubleshoot PC\noperating systems part two.\n\n559\n00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:10.285\nThere's a part one,\nnow there's gonna be a part three, and\n\n560\n00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:13.635\nthere will be a lot more in\nthe CompTIA A plus 902 series.\n\n561\n00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:15.755\nMake sure you watch all the videos,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n562\n00:30:15.755 --> 00:30:17.606\nGreat job, Wes, thanks a lot.\n\n563\n00:30:17.606 --> 00:30:19.482\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n564\n00:30:19.482 --> 00:30:21.622\nRemember,

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:17.512\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:22.244\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA A+ 902,\n\n8\n00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:25.520\nwith more of troubleshoot\nPC operating systems.\n\n9\n00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.470\nThis is part three, there's a part one,\nthere's a part two, here's a part three.\n\n10\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.670\nAnd bringing all the information\nwe need is Wes Bryan, hey Wes,\n\n11\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.590\ngood to see you again, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.378\n&gt;&gt; Hey man thanks for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:37.226\nthis is part three of the trilogy-\n&gt;&gt; The trilogy.\n\n14\n00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.842\n&gt;&gt; We've got a miniseries\nwithin a miniseries, but\n\n15\n00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.865\nthere are a few things that we\nwanna kinda round off here.\n\n16\n00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.050\nWe've got a few extra little\nobjectives that we wanna talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.590\nWe wanna make sure that you are aware\nof some of the different things\n\n18\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.510\nthat you might come across\nas you troubleshoot PCs.\n\n19\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.590\nThat's what you might\ncome across on the exam,\n\n20\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.900\nwe definitely wan you to be prepared for\nthat 220902 exam.\n\n21\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.890\nSome of the things that we're gonna talk\nabout, we're really gonna talk about,\n\n22\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.130\nit could be hardware.\n\n23\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.534\nWell, how do we diagnose the fact\nthat it might be a hardware issue,\n\n24\n00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.521\nthat's going to be with our software.\n\n25\n00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.917\nSo as we continue on through this,\ntroubleshooting PC operating systems,\n\n26\n00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:17.662\neven if it does happen to\nbe a piece of hardware,\n\n27\n00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:22.040\nthe way we troubleshoot that hardware\nis going to be with your software.\n\n28\n00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.070\nNow, that being said, one of the first\nthings we're gonna look at here in part\n\n29\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.220\nthree are devices failing to start,\na device failing to be detected.\n\n30\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.560\nWe've talked briefly about the fact that\na device could fail to start in the,\n\n31\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.900\nI think in part two here, but\nI really didn't go into it too much.\n\n32\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.390\nSo we do have to talk about it\na little bit more here in part three,\n\n33\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.640\nso that's where we're gonna start out.\n\n34\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.000\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, exactly what would do that,\n\n35\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.080\nI mean, besides the power supply,\nwhat could it be?\n\n36\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, components fail, that's one\nthing to keep in mind, components fail.\n\n37\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.640\nThe other thing that could cause a device\nnot to start is lack of a driver, or\n\n38\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.690\na corrupted driver.\n\n39\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.930\nAnd one of the places that we go\ninside of your operating system,\n\n40\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.781\nspecifically the Windows operating\nsystem when we're talking about PCs.\n\n41\n00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:12.638\nTo manage and maintain the drivers,\nare in what is known as Device Manager,\n\n42\n00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:13.856\nhence Device Manager.\n\n43\n00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:16.450\nDevices fail to start,\nthat's where you should be,\n\n44\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.000\nif you are going to troubleshoot\nany kind of device.\n\n45\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.320\nSo let me show you what I mean,\n\n46\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.380\nI got our Windows 8.1 machine here,\nthat we've been using.\n\n47\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.430\nA few different ways\nthat we can get to this,\n\n48\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.480\nI've been using the right click in\nthe administrative quick links.\n\n49\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.080\nI do want you to keep in mind that\nyou can also go to File Explorer, and\n\n50\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690\nyou could right click on This PC.\n\n51\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.180\nAnd when you right click on This PC,\nyou'll see that there is this Manage\n\n52\n00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.750\noption here, and we could dive\ndown into our computer management.\n\n53\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.880\nNow, like I said,\n\n54\n00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.440\nquite a few different ways to\nlaunch Computer Management as well.\n\n55\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.120\nThis just happens to be one of the ways\nthat I'm gonna launch it inside of this\n\n56\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.870\nepisode here.\n\n57\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.650\nNow, notice that inside of Computer\nManagement, like we've been mentioning.\n\n58\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.150\nYou really should know many different\nways to get to Computer Management for\n\n59\n00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.320\nthe exam, as well as for\nyour own benefit as an A+ technician.\n\n60\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.348\nBut what I'm looking for\nis the Device Manager right here.\n\n61\n00:03:09.348 --> 00:03:14.140\nNow inside of Device Manager, once we\nselect that, now we're on the right.\n\n62\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.206\nNo, on the left hand side, I swear,\nI know my left from my right.\n\n63\n00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:18.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At the center part of this,\n\n64\n00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:20.975\nthis is what's known as the context pane.\n\n65\n00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.396\nIn the context pane now,\n\n66\n00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:26.980\nwe have all of the hardware devices\nthat your operating system is aware of.\n\n67\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.500\nNow, there are times when you'll\nhave a category here, and\n\n68\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.740\nthey're alphabetized, that might\nshow up right around in this area.\n\n69\n00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.519\nL, M, N, O, P, I kind of gotta\nsay that when I'm [CROSSTALK].\n\n70\n00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.492\nBetween N and P, and that will be other\ndevices, now, if you have other devices,\n\n71\n00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:50.040\nwhy does it get generic,\nwhy does it say, other devices?\n\n72\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.450\nWell, it gets generic because\nyou could have lack of a driver.\n\n73\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.430\nWhen you don't have a driver present,\n\n74\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.492\nremember, the driver is\nthe component within the operating\n\n75\n00:03:58.492 --> 00:04:01.806\nsystem that allows the operating\nsystem to talk to the hardware.\n\n76\n00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:06.025\nIf the device doesn't have the hard drive,\nor excuse me, [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:10.656\nIf the operating system doesn't have\nthe driver it cannot communicate\n\n78\n00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.443\nwith the hardware itself.\n\n79\n00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:15.806\nHence, it won't start the device,\nit has no way to start the device,\n\n80\n00:04:15.806 --> 00:04:17.300\nI can't communicate with it.\n\n81\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.720\nSo if you end up having\nthis category here,\n\n82\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.900\nthere's a couple of\nthings that you can do.\n\n83\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.690\nOne of the things that I would\nrecommend to do right away is, and\n\n84\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.780\nwe'll get back to Device Manager here in\na second, I would go to Control Panel.\n\n85\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.780\nAnd getting to Control Panel,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.700\nI'm gonna right-click on our\nWindows Charm here, choose Control Panel,\n\n87\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.800\nand then we're gonna go to System and\nSecurity.\n\n88\n00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.240\nAnd we're gonna go here to Windows Update,\n\n89\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.060\nthis is one of the first\nthings that you should do.\n\n90\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.340\nAnd it looks like we do have some\nupdates that are ready to install here.\n\n91\n00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.190\nBut this is the first place that you\nshould go, and if we do update history, we\n\n92\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.870\ncould probably come in here and find some\nkind of, I see a lot of security updates.\n\n93\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.230\nAnd we do see some that\nare pending to restart,\n\n94\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.700\nI'll restart these a little bit later,\nbut let's see.\n\n95\n00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.430\nResolve issues in Windows,\nincluding, let's see,\n\n96\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.770\nokay, some of these actually won't\nfinish the install until you do restart.\n\n97\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.810\nBut I'm trying to look at some of the\ninstalled updates that we have, in fact,\n\n98\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.330\nlet me go ahead and close this down.\n\n99\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.373\nAnother way you can view installed\nupdates, if I right click and\n\n100\n00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:22.903\nchoose Programs and Features.\n\n101\n00:05:22.903 --> 00:05:26.692\nInside of Programs and Features,\nyou will notice that you have this option,\n\n102\n00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.629\nright here, view installed updates.\n\n103\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.940\nSo we look through here, we'll give it\na second, let it populate this list.\n\n104\n00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.510\nWhen it populates the list inside,\nyou could see that\n\n105\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.920\nthere are updates in here that say,\nhey, fix this problem with this device.\n\n106\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.013\nFix this problem with this device driver,\nso always do your Windows updates.\n\n107\n00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:50.213\nI'm gonna save these updates here for\n\n108\n00:05:50.213 --> 00:05:54.278\nanother episode that I wanna kind of\nshow people how to do the restart.\n\n109\n00:05:54.278 --> 00:05:58.098\nLet's see here,\na lot of these are just security fixes,\n\n110\n00:05:58.098 --> 00:06:01.050\nsometimes they're functionality flaws.\n\n111\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.712\nAnd I don't see that I'm getting much\ninformation here, but even that,\n\n112\n00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:08.780\nagain, remember, run your Windows updates.\n\n113\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.070\nNow, the other thing you can do too is,\n\n114\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.730\nyou can go to the manufacturer's website,\nthat is a great thing to do.\n\n115\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.280\nYou go to the manufacturer's website,\n\n116\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.520\nand it will ensure you that you always\nhave the latest, greatest driver.\n\n117\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.810\nBecause of the fact\nthat with your drivers,\n\n118\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.830\nkeep in mind that any of the drivers\nthat fall into Windows Update have gone\n\n119\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.620\nthrough the Windows Hardware Quality Labs,\nlike we talked about in the first part.\n\n120\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.150\nAnd it takes a little bit, they've gotta\ntest it, once they test it, they ensure\n\n121\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.180\nthat the drivers don't crash the operating\nsystem, and don't cause problems.\n\n122\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.320\nWell, they used to go on\na list called the HCL,\n\n123\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.100\nhardware compatibility list, and that\nmeant they're fully supported by whatever\n\n124\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.850\nthe Windows operating system edition is,\nor version is that you are looking at.\n\n125\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.220\nIf it was Windows 7 endorsed,\nit would go on the HCL for Windows 7.\n\n126\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.695\nIf it's Windows 8.1, it would go on\nthe hardware compatibility list,\n\n127\n00:06:58.695 --> 00:07:02.240\nand let you know that that device is\ncompatible with that operating system.\n\n128\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.371\nToday I think they've kind of done away\nwith, they still have the list, but\n\n129\n00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:08.710\nit's called the trusted, I don't know.\n\n130\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.590\nA tested platform list or something,\nit's called like a TPL today.\n\n131\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.770\nSomething a little bit different,\nbut it's essentially the same thing.\n\n132\n00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.800\nIt's a compatibility list,\nTested Product List, that's what it is.\n\n133\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.030\nIt took me a second there,\nsometimes I remember, sometimes I don't.\n\n134\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.000\nTPL, Trusted Product List, and\nit means that Microsoft has stress tested\n\n135\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.920\nthe drivers, and\nthat the device should be recognized.\n\n136\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.556\nIf that isn't the case, and again,\nkinda going back to our desktop here,\n\n137\n00:07:34.556 --> 00:07:38.030\nwe'll just right click and\nI'll choose Device Manager here.\n\n138\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.040\nThis time we'll just\nfocus on Device Manager,\n\n139\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.150\nrather than inside of Computer Management.\n\n140\n00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.194\nAgain, if you happen to have\nthe other devices list,\n\n141\n00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:48.790\nthat could be the fact that you\ndon't have the driver present.\n\n142\n00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.592\nOr if you do have a driver,\nyou might see that it is incompatible, or\n\n143\n00:07:53.592 --> 00:07:59.095\nmaybe even the fact that you're having\nsome kind of problem with the device.\n\n144\n00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:01.356\nOne of the ways you can tell that is if,\nfor instance,\n\n145\n00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.120\nyou right click on the device.\n\n146\n00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.341\nAnd he's used properties.\n\n147\n00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:05.759\nAnd this is gonna be generic,\n\n148\n00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:08.440\nit's not gonna give me anything\non the Bluetooth side.\n\n149\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.214\nLet's find another,\nI'll tell you what, maybe we'll do,\n\n150\n00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:16.216\nproperties of the, you know,\nit's not giving me those either.\n\n151\n00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:18.140\nWe'll find one here, and you know what?\n\n152\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.090\nI know what it is, it's the category.\n\n153\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.130\nThe category gives you\nabsolutely no information.\n\n154\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.240\nYou have to expand it out, and\n\n155\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.950\nyou have to pick the physical\ndevice under the category.\n\n156\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.670\nAnd there is what I'm looking for.\n\n157\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:33.120\nWe will get it, right river,\njust the wrong side of the river for sure.\n\n158\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.020\nNotice that it tells me that\nthis device is working properly.\n\n159\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.340\nNow the other thing that\nmight cause a device\n\n160\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.538\nto fail to start is if it's been disabled.\n\n161\n00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:44.400\nAnd that can happen, you can have\nsometimes, if you have end users.\n\n162\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.320\nIf you have standard users inside of\ncorporate devices or corporate networks,\n\n163\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.800\na lot of times, we limit.\n\n164\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.190\nWe implement security tactics called\nthe principle and lease privilege.\n\n165\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.600\nYou only give the user what they need\nto do their job, no more, no less.\n\n166\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.100\nSo that they can't come in here and\nget click happy, go Jiminy Clickets, and\n\n167\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.480\nclick all over these places and\nturn things off.\n\n168\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.810\nHowever, that's not necessarily\nthe case inside of a home environment.\n\n169\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.300\nAnd you might have somebody\nthat comes in In here and\n\n170\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.668\ndoes something like, let's see, the fax.\n\n171\n00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:17.420\nOkay, so I've got a printer here, and this\nisn't gonna cause any problems here, so\n\n172\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.500\njust be careful with this one.\n\n173\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.320\nNotice that I ability, and,\nI can update the driver software here.\n\n174\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.120\nLet me just take a side\nnote real quick and\n\n175\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.720\nI'm gonna kinda go off\nthe beaten path here real quick.\n\n176\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.540\nYou can also update\nthe driver software here.\n\n177\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.580\nLet me show you something\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n178\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.330\nIf I search automatically for updated\ndriver software, what this is doing is\n\n179\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.430\nit's telling Microsoft, reach out to\nWindows Update and pull the update down.\n\n180\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.010\nSo, this would be really no different\nthan running your Windows Update.\n\n181\n00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.810\nIf you do happen to have the manufacturer\ndriver, and you can determine,\n\n182\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.770\nand I'll show you how you can\ndo that here in a second.\n\n183\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.410\nYou determine that you\nhave an outdated driver,\n\n184\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.530\nyou can go to the manufacturer's website,\nyou can download it.\n\n185\n00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.240\nAnd then you can say,\n\n186\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.770\nhey, browse my computer for\nthe driver software that you downloaded.\n\n187\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.820\nOnce you choose that,\nyou can choose Browse, and\n\n188\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.490\nyou can point it to the location,\ntypically in the Downloads folder itself.\n\n189\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.730\nAnd you could point it right\nthere to the Downloads folder.\n\n190\n00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.930\nAnd you can load it into the operating\nsystem and that will help update.\n\n191\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.880\nI did wanna mention that here, real quick,\nbut back to the other point, too.\n\n192\n00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.680\nYou could see that the device is disabled.\n\n193\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.090\nAnd if that happens, one of\nthe things you'll notice right away,\n\n194\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:32.410\nnotice it says disabling this device will\ncause it to stop functioning, notice that.\n\n195\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.360\nThat means when I reboot the operating\nsystem, this device is not going to start.\n\n196\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.930\nIt isn't gonna start at all, and\nthat could be a problem here.\n\n197\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.070\nSo I'll go ahead and say, yes to this.\n\n198\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.530\nThe other thing I want you to be aware of,\n\n199\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.780\ntoo, are some of the icons that you\ncould see in Device Manager, right?\n\n200\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.680\nSo if they say device has failed to start,\nthe device isn't functioning properly.\n\n201\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.370\nAnd on the exam they give you some\nkind of exhibit, and they say,\n\n202\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.580\nhey, what's the problem here?\n\n203\n00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.980\nYou need to know that that little circle\nwith the black down arrow means that this\n\n204\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.230\ndevice has been disabled.\n\n205\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.550\nIf it happens to have a question mark,\nor not a question mark.\n\n206\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.080\nWell, yeah,\nwe'll go ahead with the question mark.\n\n207\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.428\nThe question mark under the other device\ncategories means it has no clue what\n\n208\n00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:13.090\nthat device is.\n\n209\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.420\nThat's why it gets generic, doesn't have\na driver, doesn't know what the device is,\n\n210\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.380\nso it just puts it under other devices.\n\n211\n00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.090\nSo, this question mark says I\nhave no clue what this device is.\n\n212\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.660\nTypically, what happens,\nis a couple of things.\n\n213\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.980\nYou either update the driver software for\nthat device and it's recognized.\n\n214\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.420\nOr even more so, sometimes you\nupdate the the chipset driver for\n\n215\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.970\nthe entire motherboard.\n\n216\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.690\nAnd any integrated components that now\nhave those same functionalities are now\n\n217\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.410\nrecognized by the operating system.\n\n218\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.190\nAnd they get thrown out of\nthe other device category and\n\n219\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.630\nplaced into the right locations.\n\n220\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.450\nAnd now the operating system\ncan communicate with them.\n\n221\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.080\nA little e xclamation point\nwith a yellow triangle?\n\n222\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.350\nThat typically means that the device\nis having some kind of problem.\n\n223\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.840\nAnd if you were to right click in here,\nand you were to choose\n\n224\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.015\nProperties instead of seeing,\nyou would see some kind of code here.\n\n225\n00:12:01.015 --> 00:12:04.290\nKinda like this, but\nthis one tells you the device is disabled.\n\n226\n00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.990\nAnd you can turn around, in this case,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n227\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.100\nenable the device here and\nget it working again, but.\n\n228\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.490\nYou might see some kind of code like that\nthat lets you know the device failed to\n\n229\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.230\nstart.\n\n230\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.810\nOr because there's some kind\nof error with the device.\n\n231\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.330\nNow, it's not always a one size fits all.\n\n232\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.155\nIt's not always as easy as that, because\nof the fact that I've seen CD-ROM drives,\n\n233\n00:12:24.155 --> 00:12:26.650\nor DVD-ROMs, that have completely failed.\n\n234\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.800\nAnd it says that the device is functioning\nproperly, and it won't even spin.\n\n235\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.460\nSo sometimes that works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n236\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.585\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like my life.\n\n237\n00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:37.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that is some things\nthat unfortunately can happen.\n\n238\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:43.400\nSometimes the operating system can still\ncommunicate with the device in totality.\n\n239\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.040\nBut an actuator motor has been lost or\nan actuator motor has failed.\n\n240\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.680\nIt's a mechanical device, some of that\nmechanics inside of the device fail.\n\n241\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.710\nBut the operating system isn't aware of\nit, cuz they can still communicate with\n\n242\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.660\nthings like formator boards and\nstuff, so that can happen as well.\n\n243\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.250\nNow speaking of fail to start, there are\nother things that can fail to start too.\n\n244\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.670\nWe kinda mentioned this in safe mode is\nthat, if you boot into safe mode certain\n\n245\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.120\nservices will fail to start,\nbecause they're not crucial.\n\n246\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.500\nThere's no criticality to running or\nbooting the operating system, so\n\n247\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.560\ninside of safe mode, they fail to run.\n\n248\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.800\nWell, that's okay, that's a situation\nin which you expect to see that.\n\n249\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.080\nBut there are situations in which\nyou don't expect to see that, and\n\n250\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.020\na service does fail.\n\n251\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.900\nLet me show you what I mean by that.\n\n252\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.050\nIf I right click on my desktop and\nI go to Computer Management.\n\n253\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:35.600\nOr, we're gonna kind of give you the\nremembrance back to our run line command.\n\n254\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.080\nAnd I can actually do this from\nthe modern slash metro UI if I want.\n\n255\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.390\nAnd if I type services.msc or\nMike Sierra Charlie there at the end.\n\n256\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.380\nNotice that this will bring\nme up this little gear icon.\n\n257\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.360\nAnd when I launch that,\nthat brings me to my Services Console.\n\n258\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.760\nAlso keep in mind that your Services\nConsole is in Computer Management.\n\n259\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.660\nIf I was to right click on my Windows\ncharm here, choose Computer Management.\n\n260\n00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.720\nAnd inside of Computer Management,\nif I expand out the Services and\n\n261\n00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.050\nApplications note,\nI also get the Services Console as well.\n\n262\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.760\nA couple of different ways\nto get to the same location.\n\n263\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.230\nNow I can tell you that I've seen\nservices that have failed to start\n\n264\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.220\nbecause of their startup type.\n\n265\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.120\nAnd let me show you what I mean by this,\nand\n\n266\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.930\nI'll give you a classic example where\nI've had to set this up myself.\n\n267\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.450\nAnd the service doesn't do what\nit's supposed to, all right?\n\n268\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.630\nIf I right click on\nApplication Experience,\n\n269\n00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.950\nnotice that it says that Processes\napplication compatibility.\n\n270\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.320\nOop, that's not what I want, I'm sorry.\n\n271\n00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.390\nApplication Identity,\nthe one right under it.\n\n272\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.710\nDetermines and\nverifies the identity of an application.\n\n273\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.990\nDisabling this will prevent\nAppLocker from being enforced.\n\n274\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.874\nWhen I've had to implement AppLocker to\ncontrol which applications actually start,\n\n275\n00:14:43.874 --> 00:14:47.720\nor are not allowed to start on\nan enterprise level machine.\n\n276\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.750\nThis service will cause,\nif it doesn't start,\n\n277\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.400\nwill cause AppLocker to fail as well,\nanother service completely.\n\n278\n00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.670\nAll right, so\nI wanna show you something here.\n\n279\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.635\nNotice that it says start up\ntype is manual, all right.\n\n280\n00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:03.925\nWell we've got a few\ndifferent startup types.\n\n281\n00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:06.615\nWe've got three that have\nbeen around forever, for\n\n282\n00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:08.245\na long time inside of Windows.\n\n283\n00:15:08.245 --> 00:15:11.225\nThe three are automatic,\nmanual, and disabled.\n\n284\n00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:17.125\nAutomatic means the moment that\na computer starts, start the service.\n\n285\n00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.265\nLet me give you the other extreme.\n\n286\n00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:25.210\nDisabled means exactly that, it says,\nI don't care what needs this service.\n\n287\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.200\nIt's not gonna start, doesn't matter,\ndisabled means exactly that.\n\n288\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.580\nIt means I'm not going to\nstart under any circumstances.\n\n289\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.610\nAnd the reason I say\ndisabled before manual.\n\n290\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.700\nCuz manual says, no,\n\n291\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.600\nI don't want you to start the service\nuntil something needs it.\n\n292\n00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.210\nThen go ahead and start it.\n\n293\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.670\nWell, here's the problem.\n\n294\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.800\nThis service, even though it says manual,\nand I'll even go farther than that,\n\n295\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.230\nlet me close this down and expand this\ncolumn out and show you something.\n\n296\n00:15:51.482 --> 00:15:57.398\nManual(Trigger Start), which means,\nwhen you need it, start the service.\n\n297\n00:15:57.398 --> 00:16:01.484\nEven though that says that,\nunless you run this as an automatic type,\n\n298\n00:16:01.484 --> 00:16:05.730\nit will not start even if AppLocker's\ncompletely configured to use it.\n\n299\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.877\nThis is when services can fail to start,\nit can cause problems.\n\n300\n00:16:09.877 --> 00:16:13.108\nThe other thing you also have to keep\nin mind too, a big one, more for\n\n301\n00:16:13.108 --> 00:16:15.776\nyour A+ level,\nthat's more on the enterprise level,\n\n302\n00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:18.850\nwhether they hit you with that or\nnot, I highly doubt it on A+.\n\n303\n00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.890\nBut one of the things you definitely need\nto know, is inside of Microsoft's, or\n\n304\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.570\nexcuse me, I'm sorry Windows,\nthe printer is not necessarily,\n\n305\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.780\nlike I've mentioned in other episodes,\nthe physical device that we see.\n\n306\n00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.850\nAll right?\nMicrosoft calls that the print device.\n\n307\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.850\nNow, you and I, Zach, I'm sure we talk\nabout it all the time, on the host floor,\n\n308\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.230\nout there where we're doing our\nresearch and creating shows.\n\n309\n00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.162\nWe call the printer the physical device\nwhere the paper comes out, not so\n\n310\n00:16:43.162 --> 00:16:44.558\nin Microsoft land.\n\n311\n00:16:44.558 --> 00:16:48.320\nIn Microsoft land, the printer is\nthe actual component within the operating\n\n312\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.600\nsystem, that manages the entire\nprint functionality.\n\n313\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.580\nSo when I do a Ctrl+P shortcut or I right\nclick on it and say print, well it's\n\n314\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.600\nnot really the device that they call a\nprinter, they call that the print device.\n\n315\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.870\nThe printer, itself, is the service that\nruns within the operating system and\n\n316\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.810\nlet me show you here what I mean.\n\n317\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.750\nSo and we've kind of picked\non the Print Spooler before.\n\n318\n00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:16.380\nPrint Spooler is actually manages, notice\nit says service prints the spool job,\n\n319\n00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.370\nhandles the interaction with the printer.\n\n320\n00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.950\nAll right?\nIf you turn off this service,\n\n321\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.630\nwhat happens?\n\n322\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.944\nYou won't be able to print.\n\n323\n00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:27.525\nNow, this can happen.\n\n324\n00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:29.380\nRight?\nIf it happens it might\n\n325\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.240\nbe the fact that somebody has disabled it,\nthey've stopped it and\n\n326\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.478\nthey choose okay and they go to print,\nand now, the service has failed.\n\n327\n00:17:38.478 --> 00:17:39.324\nAll right?\n\n328\n00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:40.672\nSo, that can happen, as well.\n\n329\n00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:41.360\nAll right?\n\n330\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.000\nThe only other one,\nwe've already kind of mentioned is that,\n\n331\n00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.194\nif somebody is in MS Config and I'll\ngo ahead and let me run MS Config here.\n\n332\n00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.170\nI've already touched base on this, but\n\n333\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.420\nI wanna kind of just double\nback on it real quick.\n\n334\n00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.250\nIs if you are in a Diagnostic startup,\n\n335\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.208\nnotice it says Load basic devices and\nservices only.\n\n336\n00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:04.900\nUnlike the default, which is Load\nall device drivers and all services.\n\n337\n00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.500\nIf you load the diagnostic startup,\nyou are saying only load the services and\n\n338\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.030\ndevices that are crucial to get\nthe operating system online and running.\n\n339\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.400\nIt's good for troubleshooting.\n\n340\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.590\nProblem is, this is a persistent\nsetting that once you apply it,\n\n341\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.970\nunless you change it back to normal\nstart up, it doesn't undo itself.\n\n342\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.060\nThis could be one of the situations\nwhere you get a tech,\n\n343\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.740\ngets a little bit too quick and\nkind of forgets, and\n\n344\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.690\nit happens, I've been in a rush too,\nthey restart the operating system.\n\n345\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.430\nBut, when the restart the machine,\nthey kind of forget that they've set that\n\n346\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.831\ndiagnostics startup, and\nnow it's causing problems.\n\n347\n00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:39.520\nAll right?\n\n348\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.450\nSo those are a couple of ways that\nyou could run into problems too.\n\n349\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.650\nAll right?\n\n350\n00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.900\nNow, other things that might happen,\nyou might have things like compatibility\n\n351\n00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.640\nerrors and\nwhen you have compatibility errors,\n\n352\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.270\nyou really don't see it too much anymore,\nunless you're really\n\n353\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:19:00.060\ntrying to run an application, it really\ngoes all the way back to the days of XP.\n\n354\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.860\nThe reason I say that is, because since\nthe days of Vista, for the most part,\n\n355\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.400\nyour applications are relying on\nthe same underlying file structure,\n\n356\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.972\nfolder structure, and architecture.\n\n357\n00:19:10.972 --> 00:19:11.850\nAll right?\n\n358\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.670\nIf you're still running some\napplications that are supported for\n\n359\n00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.580\nXP, again, there were some folder changes,\nthey're directory structure changes,\n\n360\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.080\nthat might cause compatibility\nerrors to occur.\n\n361\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.110\nIf that happens,\nlet me show you how you can fix it.\n\n362\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.060\nSo I'm gonna use not my fault here,\njust because I can\n\n363\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.550\nshow you where it's located and if you\ntake any one of these applications, right?\n\n364\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.510\nYou take an application,\n\n365\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:41.020\nif you right click on it, notice you can\nTroubleshoot compatibility, right here?\n\n366\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.770\nWell if I scroll down, I can also\nchoose the Properties option and\n\n367\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.080\nthere is a Compatibility tab,\nnotice that right there.\n\n368\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.350\nAnd in that Compatibility tab,\nI can actually run the compatibility\n\n369\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.390\ntroubleshooter, just\nlike a right click here.\n\n370\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:58.020\nBut I can also, notice this Compatibility\nmode, I can choose that, and look how\n\n371\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.619\nfar back I can run in compatibility,\nall the way back to Windows 95.\n\n372\n00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.468\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; If you're running an application on\n\n373\n00:20:04.468 --> 00:20:09.210\nan Windows 8.1 machine, that was made for\nWindows 95, you need to upgrade.\n\n374\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:09.710\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.704\n&gt;&gt; You're really living in the past,\n\n376\n00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:13.280\nlive in the now, man.\nBut\n\n377\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.121\nthere are some-\n&gt;&gt; You've got\n\n378\n00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:14.700\nmail.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n379\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.300\nright.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.580\n&gt;&gt; So there are things that you can\n\n381\n00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.370\ndo here.\n\n382\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.400\nAgain they talk about reduce color mode,\nso if you wanna go back to SVGA, you\n\n383\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.580\ncan go back, that's actually 256 bit,\nthat's VGA mode, right?\n\n384\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.810\nXGA I think is the 65,534 colors, right?\n\n385\n00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.070\nYeah, I think that's XGA,\nExtended Graphics Array.\n\n386\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.160\nBut again, you could run\nthe program as administrator and\n\n387\n00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.400\nI will tell you that this setting\nright here, let me go ahead and\n\n388\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.150\nturn this off before I make\neverything uncompatible.\n\n389\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.590\nRunning a program as administrator\ndoes go back to the days of XP, and\n\n390\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:54.330\nthe reason I say that is, in the days of\nXP, a lot of applications were written to\n\n391\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.780\nhave writable access to the registry,\nto be able to make modifications, right?\n\n392\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.120\nThat's a big security flaw.\n\n393\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.590\nRight?\nA big security vulnerability,\n\n394\n00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.740\nand when we went to the standard user\narchitecture that was released Vista and\n\n395\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.550\nthen, continued in Windows 7, Windows 8,\n8.1, even in Windows 10 today.\n\n396\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.190\nThey said, no, no, no,\nunless you're administrator,\n\n397\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.690\nyou don't have that privileged access to\nthe registry, which was a good thing.\n\n398\n00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.170\nThe problem is,\nwith some of these older applications,\n\n399\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.930\nthat were written to run on XP,\nit could cause them to fail, right?\n\n400\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.850\nThey didn't know what\nthe user account control is,\n\n401\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.260\nthis little thing that pops up and\nsays, hey, did you mean to do that?\n\n402\n00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.420\nClick continue to continue, or\nyour username and password,\n\n403\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.225\nif your administrator.\n\n404\n00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:35.850\nSo, that is something that you can do,\nas well.\n\n405\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.588\nAll right, so, it's a little bit\nabout the compatibility issues, too.\n\n406\n00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:41.770\nNow the other thing that can happen,\nsometimes too,\n\n407\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.116\nis we could have files, the fail to open.\n\n408\n00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:47.545\nWhen we have files that fail to open,\n\n409\n00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:49.620\nthere's a few things that\ncould cause this, as well.\n\n410\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.540\nAll right?\n\n411\n00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.313\nOne of the biggest reasons we have is,\nimproper file association,\n\n412\n00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:59.470\nall right, and improper file association,\nwhat do I mean by that?\n\n413\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.322\nWell, understand what a file extension is.\n\n414\n00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:03.820\nAll right?\nWe have file extensions,\n\n415\n00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.850\nthere's a bunch of them, all right?\n\n416\n00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.710\nAnd in fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n417\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.337\nAll right, by default in Windows,\nthey are hidden, and\n\n418\n00:22:09.337 --> 00:22:11.210\nyou don't typically see them, right?\n\n419\n00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.590\nBecause the average end user\ndoesn't care about file extensions,\n\n420\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.160\nbut you guys are not the average user,\nright?\n\n421\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.862\nYou guys and\n\n422\n00:22:17.862 --> 00:22:21.080\ngals are gonna be our IT techs,\nyou're the tech future for tomorrow.\n\n423\n00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.832\nSo I'm not talking about you.\n\n424\n00:22:22.832 --> 00:22:23.400\nAll right?\n\n425\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.130\nSo you can actually modify the view, and\n\n426\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:30.120\nI'll do this in File Explorer with the\nView tab, or the ribbon I should say, and\n\n427\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.210\nI can change the folder and\nsearch options, right?\n\n428\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.140\nAnd in the folder and search options here,\nI can go to the View tab and I want you to\n\n429\n00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.757\nnotice that it says, look at this,\nhide extensions for known file types.\n\n430\n00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:45.940\nIf I uncheck that, and I choose OK, notice\nthat I get a little bit more information\n\n431\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.128\nright, at the end of all my files now,\nnotice the dot whatever?\n\n432\n00:22:49.128 --> 00:22:53.920\nWell, this .exe in this case and\n.txt, the file extensions\n\n433\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.970\ntell the operating system what\nprogram to associate the file with.\n\n434\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.000\nAll right?\nAnd if they're incorrectly mapped,\n\n435\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.280\nthen what you could have is, if I change\nthis notmyfault.exe which is supposed to\n\n436\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.250\nbe an application to a .txt, it's gonna\nsay that's a text document and it's\n\n437\n00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.300\ngonna associate it, that when I open it\nup it's gonna associate it with Notepad.\n\n438\n00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.510\nBut that's not what I want, all right?\n\n439\n00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.820\nOr even worse, I've seen sometimes where\npeople have taken the extension off.\n\n440\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.780\nLet's see if I can force this,\nsometimes it doesn't allow you to do that,\n\n441\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.830\nbecause it doesn't like this.\n\n442\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.020\nAll right?\nNotice if you change the file extension it\n\n443\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.960\nmight become unusable,\nthis would cause a file to fail to open.\n\n444\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.160\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay yes to this and notice that,\n\n445\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.250\nI no longer have a little\nNotepad icon anymore, right?\n\n446\n00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.070\nAnd when I go to click it, notice it's,\nwell, wait a second, what are you doing?\n\n447\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.856\nAnd it fails to open and then,\nI have to associate it with Notepad again,\n\n448\n00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:51.047\nby clicking Notepad.\n\n449\n00:23:51.047 --> 00:23:55.208\nAll right, now, once I show those\nextensions, I have to actually rename this\n\n450\n00:23:55.208 --> 00:24:00.100\nto the right file extension, in order\nto associate it back with that program.\n\n451\n00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.402\nWell, where do we se those\nfile associations, all right?\n\n452\n00:24:02.402 --> 00:24:04.898\nWhere they get stored?\n\n453\n00:24:04.898 --> 00:24:06.597\nWell, that's actually\npart of your registry.\n\n454\n00:24:06.597 --> 00:24:09.567\nAnd if we look,\none of the tools that they talk about and\n\n455\n00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:13.978\nbe very careful using this next tool\nthat I'm gonna use, it's called regedit.\n\n456\n00:24:13.978 --> 00:24:15.553\nIt's a registry editor okay.\n\n457\n00:24:15.553 --> 00:24:20.339\nYour registry is essentially\na database of configurations that your\n\n458\n00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:25.207\noperating system uses to set the runtime\nenvironment of the operating\n\n459\n00:24:25.207 --> 00:24:28.436\nsystem in the configuration\nof the hardware.\n\n460\n00:24:28.436 --> 00:24:29.700\nAll right and you can launch it.\n\n461\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.676\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nlaunch this just from the start screen,\n\n462\n00:24:33.676 --> 00:24:35.340\nand we're gonna type regedit.\n\n463\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.122\nAll right, now it is an executable and\nI will tell you,\n\n464\n00:24:38.122 --> 00:24:41.524\nthey also have another version of\nthis that they've kept around.\n\n465\n00:24:41.524 --> 00:24:45.370\nNotice I have the redg and,\nreally check that out of there.\n\n466\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.925\nNotice I have regedt32.\n\n467\n00:24:46.925 --> 00:24:50.880\nThese both want the same utility.\n\n468\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.587\nIn the earlier days, they would launch\ntwo different utilities or, well.\n\n469\n00:24:54.587 --> 00:24:56.103\nIn the earlier days,\n\n470\n00:24:56.103 --> 00:25:00.750\nthe way you would launch the registry\neditor is with regedt32.\n\n471\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:05.625\nNow that isn't called out by your tools,\nbut I want you to know just in case for\n\n472\n00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:08.850\nthe exam I will tell you,\nif I go ahead and run this,\n\n473\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.420\nat low resolution, let's see here.\n\n474\n00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.980\nCan I change my resolution?\n\n475\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.185\nI might have to do that.\n\n476\n00:25:14.185 --> 00:25:19.769\nI was hoping I'd get away with not doing\nthat because we get these black bars here.\n\n477\n00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:20.791\nLet me revert this.\n\n478\n00:25:20.791 --> 00:25:23.299\nLet me see if I can run this from.\n\n479\n00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:27.178\nIt might give me a hard time, but\n\n480\n00:25:27.178 --> 00:25:31.067\nif not I can also run it regedit.\n\n481\n00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:35.279\nAgain, regedit from the traditional\nrun line, and it is exe.\n\n482\n00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:36.987\nAnd there we go.\n\n483\n00:25:36.987 --> 00:25:38.443\nSo, it's launching up.\n\n484\n00:25:38.443 --> 00:25:43.119\nIt didn't like it from the modern UI cuz\nthe modern UI expects a certain resolution\n\n485\n00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:45.423\nand if you don't have that resolution,\n\n486\n00:25:45.423 --> 00:25:48.380\nthe modern UI goes,\nI'm sorry I can't help you.\n\n487\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.987\nBut, the run line command\ndidn't give me a hard time.\n\n488\n00:25:50.987 --> 00:25:53.006\nSo these are what\nare known as registry keys.\n\n489\n00:25:53.006 --> 00:25:55.111\nActually, these are called hives.\n\n490\n00:25:55.111 --> 00:25:59.918\nAnd again, you have these five hives,\nclasses route we'll get to in a second.\n\n491\n00:25:59.918 --> 00:26:02.110\nThat’s actually where we're going,\nI'll just go ahead and let you know here.\n\n492\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.427\nHKEY current user,\nthis is all the running configurations for\n\n493\n00:26:05.427 --> 00:26:08.190\nthe user that is currently\nlogged into the machine.\n\n494\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.613\nI'm gonna skip down to the HKEY USER,\n\n495\n00:26:10.613 --> 00:26:13.880\nbecause they're not\nsynonymous with each other.\n\n496\n00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.159\nBut HKEY USER has all of\nthe registry configurations for\n\n497\n00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:20.658\nevery user that has an account\non this machine, all right?\n\n498\n00:26:20.658 --> 00:26:25.489\nAnd when I log in, the operating system\nsays let me look for the use profile for\n\n499\n00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:28.030\nWes, in this case admin is the user name.\n\n500\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.409\nAnd let me take those configurations and\nI'll load them up Into HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\n\n501\n00:26:32.409 --> 00:26:36.899\nWhen you make modifications to your\nbackground, your desktop, your screen\n\n502\n00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:41.181\nsaver and you log off, those settings\nget pulled out of CURRENT_USER and\n\n503\n00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:44.276\nsaved to your location within HKEY_USERS,\nokay?\n\n504\n00:26:44.276 --> 00:26:48.240\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, this is all\nthe hardware configuration.\n\n505\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.084\nAll right HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG is for\nthings like plug and play devices, but\n\n506\n00:26:53.084 --> 00:26:58.110\nwhat I will wanna kind of show you guys\nand gals out there is HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.\n\n507\n00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.204\nThese are the file extensions\nthat your computer is aware of.\n\n508\n00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:06.014\nAll right, and if I was to scroll\ndown through here And let me scroll,\n\n509\n00:27:06.014 --> 00:27:09.562\nif you get past the dots,\nyou're no longer in file extensions,\n\n510\n00:27:09.562 --> 00:27:12.330\ncuz you'll see that it does stop here.\n\n511\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.427\nBut if I look at .txt, remember Zack,\n\n512\n00:27:14.427 --> 00:27:18.131\nthat was the one that we were looking\nat in that folder there, right?\n\n513\n00:27:18.131 --> 00:27:22.704\nIf I expand out .txt, and\nI look at, I believe it's shell new.\n\n514\n00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:28.734\nCould you tell me what executable it\ntells me to associate .txt with there.\n\n515\n00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:29.460\nDo you see there.\n\n516\n00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.835\n&gt;&gt; It is notepad.\n\n517\n00:27:31.835 --> 00:27:32.458\n&gt;&gt; Notepad right?\n\n518\n00:27:32.458 --> 00:27:35.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So when we have file associations like\n\n519\n00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:39.674\nyou see and like I just set here in\nthe background in this folder right,\n\n520\n00:27:39.674 --> 00:27:42.710\n.txt and it gets me this little icon here.\n\n521\n00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.734\n&gt;&gt; See the Notepad icon?\n\n522\n00:27:43.734 --> 00:27:46.720\nWhat it's doing is it's looking\ndown at the registry and saying,\n\n523\n00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.450\nokay, what program should I associate\nthis file extension with, all right?\n\n524\n00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.080\nAnd that's how it matched,\nthat's how it knows.\n\n525\n00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.265\nWhen you modify these file\nextensions like you've seen I did,\n\n526\n00:27:55.265 --> 00:27:59.430\nthey can fail to open the files because it\ndoesn't know what to open the file with.\n\n527\n00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.873\nNow, the other place that I want you to\nknow that you can set this is if I get\n\n528\n00:28:04.873 --> 00:28:08.745\ndown into the Control Panel,\nAll right, and I go to Programs.\n\n529\n00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:11.460\nAnd notice we have this\nDefault Programs here.\n\n530\n00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.240\nWhen I get into Default Programs,\nnotice this associate a file type or\n\n531\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.598\nprotocol with a program, right?\n\n532\n00:28:18.598 --> 00:28:23.502\nWell, if I choose this, it will take\na second and it's gonna look for\n\n533\n00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:28.072\nall the different file extensions,\nand notice how it says hey,\n\n534\n00:28:28.072 --> 00:28:31.970\nthis file is associated with this program.\n\n535\n00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:36.808\nAnd if I scroll down here, I'm sure\nI can probably find txt in the list.\n\n536\n00:28:36.808 --> 00:28:38.832\nSorry guys to make you\na little seasick out there.\n\n537\n00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:45.229\nLet's see if we can kinda scroll fast here\nso you guys don't have to wait on me.\n\n538\n00:28:45.229 --> 00:28:46.832\nJust about outside.\n\n539\n00:28:46.832 --> 00:28:48.854\nYou gotta scroll a little bit farther,\nWes.\n\n540\n00:28:48.854 --> 00:28:51.207\nJust gotta know what.\n\n541\n00:28:51.207 --> 00:28:53.354\nCuz I didn't go far enough.\n\n542\n00:28:53.354 --> 00:28:55.026\nJust gotta know your alphabet, Wes.\n\n543\n00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:57.851\nIf anybody could help me notice,\nthis says .txt.\n\n544\n00:28:57.851 --> 00:28:59.182\nThis is a text document.\n\n545\n00:28:59.182 --> 00:29:02.586\nAnd if I look over it's\nassociated with Notepad.\n\n546\n00:29:02.586 --> 00:29:06.263\nAll right, so I don't recommend\nmodifying file associations in any way\n\n547\n00:29:06.263 --> 00:29:10.363\nthrough the registry but you have to\nknow R-E-G-E-D-I-T, for the exam and\n\n548\n00:29:10.363 --> 00:29:11.219\nknow what it is.\n\n549\n00:29:11.219 --> 00:29:14.442\nAllows you to view and manage and\nmaintain your settings and\n\n550\n00:29:14.442 --> 00:29:18.443\nconfigurations within your operating\nsystem, however I will tell you.\n\n551\n00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:22.109\nIf you change your program in here its\ngive you graphical user interphase and\n\n552\n00:29:22.109 --> 00:29:24.985\nsometimes it gives you a little\nbit of warning, all right.\n\n553\n00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:25.866\nAre you sure you wanna do this?\n\n554\n00:29:25.866 --> 00:29:26.913\nAre you really sure?\n\n555\n00:29:26.913 --> 00:29:28.552\nRegedit does not do that.\n\n556\n00:29:28.552 --> 00:29:31.255\nThe registry editor, when you make\na change for better or worse,\n\n557\n00:29:31.255 --> 00:29:32.580\nit's instantaneous.\n\n558\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.721\nAnd you can caused basically\nirreversible damage on your machine and\n\n559\n00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:36.976\nyou might have to reset it.\n\n560\n00:29:36.976 --> 00:29:38.521\nSo it's instantaneous.\n\n561\n00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:40.317\nSo be very, very careful.\n\n562\n00:29:40.317 --> 00:29:43.502\nI'm not saying that you don't have\nto make registry modifications and\n\n563\n00:29:43.502 --> 00:29:47.810\nI'm certainly not saying I haven't\nhad to make registry modifications.\n\n564\n00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.400\nHowever just be careful and\nknow what you're doing.\n\n565\n00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.014\nCouple of last things that we wanna talk\nabout real quick here I know Zack will\n\n566\n00:29:54.014 --> 00:29:55.262\ncome at the end time here.\n\n567\n00:29:55.262 --> 00:30:00.268\nBut let's there are a couple of\nthings that we need to mention\n\n568\n00:30:00.268 --> 00:30:04.700\nREGSVR32 REG serve 32,\nThis is one that is here.\n\n569\n00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.804\nIt's for associating object linking and\nabetting technologies inside of Windows.\n\n570\n00:30:09.804 --> 00:30:13.108\nI don't commonly use that one a lot,\nbut I'd show you where you can find it.\n\n571\n00:30:13.108 --> 00:30:20.040\nIf we get down into File Explorer,\nI get down into Local Disk C, Windows.\n\n572\n00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.232\nAnd I'll just go ahead and type that out.\n\n573\n00:30:22.232 --> 00:30:24.880\nA little bit faster there, System32.\n\n574\n00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:30.280\nAnd if you search in System32, for\nREGSRV, I always remember SRV for\n\n575\n00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.700\nStevie Ray Vaughn,\none of my favorite blues guitarists.\n\n576\n00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.086\nThere's not an extra E in WES.\n\n577\n00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:41.030\nWe gotta take the extra E out there.\n\n578\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:48.445\nREGSRV, we give it a second here and\ntype 32, I believe it is.\n\n579\n00:30:48.445 --> 00:30:49.850\nI'm not finding it here.\n\n580\n00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:50.672\nLet me go ahead, I tell you what.\n\n581\n00:30:50.672 --> 00:30:53.670\nLet’s go ahead,\nwe're gonna go local disk C.\n\n582\n00:30:53.670 --> 00:31:00.474\nLet's get into system 32 and now that\nwe're in here, we'll type that again.\n\n583\n00:31:00.474 --> 00:31:02.810\nAnd I believe, it's not finding it.\n\n584\n00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.647\nThat is interesting, r, e, g.\n\n585\n00:31:04.647 --> 00:31:07.470\nYou know, I was going to say\nbecause it's not something because,\n\n586\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.590\nmaybe I need the full path.\n\n587\n00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.061\nMaybe that's why it's\ngiving me a hard time.\n\n588\n00:31:11.061 --> 00:31:11.834\nNo, it's not.\n\n589\n00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:17.866\nAgain, this is one of the ways that\nyou can basically register and\n\n590\n00:31:17.866 --> 00:31:21.486\nun-register ole, O-L-E objects,\n\n591\n00:31:21.486 --> 00:31:27.210\nagain the embedding in objects,\nembedding in linking.\n\n592\n00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.665\nAgain I don't really use this ne too much\nand it's interesting that i cannot srb,\n\n593\n00:31:30.665 --> 00:31:32.330\njust to make sure that I typed it right.\n\n594\n00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:37.500\nYeah I typed it right and\nI don't seem to able to find it in here.\n\n595\n00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.261\nI'll tell you what.\nLet's switch over to our server here and\n\n596\n00:31:42.261 --> 00:31:46.590\nsee if I can find it\nin the server as well.\n\n597\n00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.430\nLet's close that up.\n\n598\n00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.469\nAs you can see,\nI was kind of looking for it earlier.\n\n599\n00:31:51.469 --> 00:31:54.884\nAgain, it's one that I've seen it,\nI know that it's there.\n\n600\n00:31:54.884 --> 00:31:56.580\nI don't know why the service isn't.\n\n601\n00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.060\nThe search isn't finding it.\n\n602\n00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.017\n&gt;&gt; These are teachable moments.\n\n603\n00:32:01.017 --> 00:32:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes these are.\n\n604\n00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.230\nThese absolutely are, but\nit should be in there.\n\n605\n00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.170\nI want to say it's in\nthe system 32 folder.\n\n606\n00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:14.180\nLet's go ahead and do this by type.\n\n607\n00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.130\nActually, I'll do this by name, as well.\n\n608\n00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:22.320\nAnd if I scroll through here, I want\nto say that I believe it's still here.\n\n609\n00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.940\nAnd again, you can use it.\n\n610\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.390\nAgain, it's got a few options.\n\n611\n00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.790\nI actually got an MUI file\nthat goes with it, as well.\n\n612\n00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.360\nAnd the MUI file is just a language file.\n\n613\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.240\nLet's see here.\n\n614\n00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.970\nAgain, it's one of those ones.\n\n615\n00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.220\nAgain, it's on the exam.\n\n616\n00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.050\nI don't commonly use it, but\nI just wanted to kind of mentioned it.\n\n617\n00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.060\nThere, let's see.\n\n618\n00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.310\nOkay, we're getting close.\n\n619\n00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.150\nRE, so there it is, all right.\n\n620\n00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:58.480\nSo it's there, and I'm almost positive\nthat it is in Windows 8 as well.\n\n621\n00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.730\nI don't know why I'm not finding it there,\nbut you can see it.\n\n622\n00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.610\nAgain, it's a register service.\n\n623\n00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:08.065\nI am not willing to\nthrow in the towel yet.\n\n624\n00:33:08.065 --> 00:33:11.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n625\n00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.650\nI know that it's here.\n\n626\n00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.610\nThat's right.\n\n627\n00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.430\nSo I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n628\n00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.150\nI'm gonna scroll down here as well.\n\n629\n00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.250\nBecause again I know that it's there.\n\n630\n00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.000\nI don't know why the search\nfunctionality isn't finding it.\n\n631\n00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.630\nBut again it's one of those things and\nI want, now, now I have to find it, and\n\n632\n00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.861\nsure enough, you see it's right there, and\n\n633\n00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:34.965\nagain r-e-g-s, s-v-r,\nit's not Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\n634\n00:33:34.965 --> 00:33:38.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Steven Victor Romeo is what it is.\n\n635\n00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.960\nYou have to spell it right for\nthe search engine to find it.\n\n636\n00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.100\nLet's try that again.\n\n637\n00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.998\nSo let's try Reg Svr32.\n\n638\n00:33:43.998 --> 00:33:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Just a momentary dyslexia,\nthat's all it was.\n\n639\n00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:53.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and yeah absolutely and\nthere's the MUI file as well there,\n\n640\n00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.720\nand if you click it shows you\nagain allows you to register and\n\n641\n00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.300\nunregister things like ActiveX objects\n&gt;&gt; DLLs as well\n\n642\n00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.340\nlike we were talking about\nin the last part there.\n\n643\n00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.250\nSo know a little bit about that.\n\n644\n00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.730\nThe other thing that you might\nrun into is slow performance.\n\n645\n00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.920\nAnd when it comes to slow performance,\n\n646\n00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.070\nI just want you guys to keep in mind use\nthings like your performance monitor.\n\n647\n00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.810\nIf you do have slow performance,\n\n648\n00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.780\nwe've got all different types of\nlittle utilities that we can use.\n\n649\n00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Defrag.\n\n650\n00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.760\n&gt;&gt; That yeah that's right,\nwe do have to talk about defrag.\n\n651\n00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.700\nSo let's go ahead and\nI tell you what, let me go ahead and\n\n652\n00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.560\ndo a performance monitor, and\nwe'll get right to defragging.\n\n653\n00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.210\nLet me show you that too,\nthanks for reminding me Zach,\n\n654\n00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.080\nI almost forgot that one, and\nthat one's important, too.\n\n655\n00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, perform, yeah.\n\n656\n00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.610\n&gt;&gt; Task Manager is right\nhere on the desktop,\n\n657\n00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.470\njust right-clicking on the taskbar and you\ncan look at performance-based information\n\n658\n00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:47.860\nhere\n&gt;&gt; If you believe that your disk is full,\n\n659\n00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.570\nmaybe you need to upgrade memory.\n\n660\n00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.860\nIf you have an antivirus,\nmaybe your network adapter is full.\n\n661\n00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.670\nYou can also use the resource\nmonitor here as well.\n\n662\n00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.790\nResource monitor is great.\n\n663\n00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.450\nRemember that you can also\nuse performance monitor and\n\n664\n00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.480\nperformance monitor is in your.\n\n665\n00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.930\n&gt;&gt; Your administrative utilities,\n\n666\n00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.710\nbut you can also do what's\nknown as a perfmon.exe and\n\n667\n00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.780\nwhen you choose OK to this, this launches\nup your performance monitor likewise, too.\n\n668\n00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.170\nSo three great utilities if you have slow\nperformance, again check for a full drive.\n\n669\n00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.490\nCheck for the fact that you\nneed RAM to be upgraded or\n\n670\n00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.300\nmore ram you might need.\n\n671\n00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.490\nYou might have malware,\n\n672\n00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:34.640\ndon't always blame it on malware again\nlook at some of the obvious fixes.\n\n673\n00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.930\nIt's easy to run an antivirus scan so\nthat can happen,\n\n674\n00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.400\nWe will talk about antivirus\nin another episode.\n\n675\n00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.110\nAnd thank you for\n\n676\n00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.010\nreminding me Zach as always,\nI'm glad you got my back on this one.\n\n677\n00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.570\nLast one but not least is defrag.\n\n678\n00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.910\nKeep in mind that when you run defrag,\n\n679\n00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:54.195\nthere are a couple different\nways you can use this.\n\n680\n00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:59.640\nDefrag.exe is your drive optimizer in\nthe command prompt text based input,\n\n681\n00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.630\ntext based output.\n\n682\n00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.330\nAnd there's a couple of things you could\ndo for instance you could do an analysis\n\n683\n00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:12.737\nlike for instance I can do a defrag if I\ncan spell that right defrag space a for\n\n684\n00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:18.090\nanalyze and then if I want to\nsee the out put on the screen.\n\n685\n00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.740\nI can run a u, and I believe I have to\nput the drive letter, yeah there we go.\n\n686\n00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.090\nSo if you notice it's\nrunning in output and\n\n687\n00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.910\nit actually prints the,\nor does an analyze and\n\n688\n00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.780\nthen it prints the output right here to\nthe screen and it lets me know that, hey.\n\n689\n00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.670\nYes there is a fragmented free space,\nor fragmented space.\n\n690\n00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.000\nWhat's the largest free space and stuff.\n\n691\n00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.430\nIt says that it is recommended\nthat you defragment this drive.\n\n692\n00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.530\nAnd at that point, what we could end\nup doing is, we could do a defrag and\n\n693\n00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:54.120\nnot run this time the A, cuz A is just\ngive you an analysis, analyze it, right?\n\n694\n00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.316\nAt this point, what I would do is a defrag\nC:\\ or probably leave the backslash off.\n\n695\n00:36:57.316 --> 00:37:02.990\nAnd then what you can do is,\nI want you guys to see the output.\n\n696\n00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:08.090\nSo the u option just says show me the text\non the screen when you're running and\n\n697\n00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.450\nyou can see it's doing\nan analysis to begin with,\n\n698\n00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.310\nit always does an analysis\nwhether you want it to or not.\n\n699\n00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.390\nAnd then, notice what it is doing\nit is running your defrag option.\n\n700\n00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.940\nSo a few different things\nthat you can do in\n\n701\n00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.880\norder to make sure that your\nPCs are trouble free and if you\n\n702\n00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.140\ndo run into problems some of the things\nthat you can do to troubleshoot them.\n\n703\n00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.450\nWe'll go ahead and let this run here\nyou might as well I mean Zacky you're\n\n704\n00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.610\nreminding us about it so\nit doesn't seem to be taking too long and\n\n705\n00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.880\nwe can kind of see what\nthe output of defrag is.\n\n706\n00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.410\nWhile that's running I want you\nto keep in mind that if I was To\n\n707\n00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.380\ntry to open the wrong thing.\n\n708\n00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.520\nIf I was to get to my desktop and open up\nFile Explorer, right click on local disk\n\n709\n00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.980\nC, and choose Properties,\nI could also go to Tools,\n\n710\n00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.560\nthe Tools tab, and you could do this\nfrom a graphical user interface,\n\n711\n00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.940\nto the optimize and\ndefrag option, right here.\n\n712\n00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.405\nSo that is your GUI base versus\ndefrag.exe which you can see here.\n\n713\n00:38:05.405 --> 00:38:08.920\nDefrag.exe obviously is the command line.\n\n714\n00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.000\nIt does look like it's almost done here so\nwe'll wait just a few more minutes.\n\n715\n00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.190\nHopefully we're not boring you ladies and\ngentlemen out there and\n\n716\n00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.330\nyou can kinda see what\nthe output looks like here.\n\n717\n00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.400\nAnd it's doing some consolidation.\n\n718\n00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.680\nKeep in mind that the defrag option, what\nit's doing is it's taking your files And\n\n719\n00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.700\neven though inside of the operating\nsystem, when I look at a file,\n\n720\n00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.610\nI see it in a single location\nphysically on the hard drive.\n\n721\n00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.620\nIt could be stored pieces\nall over the hard drive.\n\n722\n00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.390\nAnd then that get difficult for\n\n723\n00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.970\nthe operating system to move and\nwork with that file.\n\n724\n00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:42.920\nPhysically, it's chopped up and located or\nfragmented all over the hard drive.\n\n725\n00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.870\nSo, what this does is,\nit finds the fragmented space and\n\n726\n00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.790\nit re-allocates, if you will, and,\n\n727\n00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:53.150\nkind of, puts the files, rearranges them,\ninto a more contiguous space.\n\n728\n00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.660\nAnd that's what it's doing, you see\nthe defragmentation is good, but you\n\n729\n00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.200\nalso have fragmented free space, right,\ncause we move all the files around, right.\n\n730\n00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.330\nNow we've got free space, and\n\n731\n00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.550\nwhat it's doing is it's\nconsolidating that free space.\n\n732\n00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.390\nSo we got nice contiguous files and\nwhat it can do in the end, is ultimately.\n\n733\n00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.290\nI don't know how long\nthis is going to take.\n\n734\n00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:16.770\nBut ultimately it could end up,\nGiving you better performance,\n\n735\n00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.810\nagain, inside of your operating system.\n\n736\n00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.950\nAnd this does look like it's\ntaking a little bit longer.\n\n737\n00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:25.290\nBut essentially, that's what you see,\nthat's what we have.\n\n738\n00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.040\nWe have our disk defragmenter.\n\n739\n00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.870\nAnd you can see the analysis here versus\nit performing multiple passes across that.\n\n740\n00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:38.370\nHopefully it You basically eliminate\nsome five minutes base and well,\n\n741\n00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:43.420\nit gives you a little bit better\nperformance on your mechanical drives.\n\n742\n00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.770\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, meaning you're back on the old\ndays that took almost over a night for\n\n743\n00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.513\nsomething to defrag, I remember that.\n\n744\n00:39:48.513 --> 00:39:50.230\nPC operating system, this is part three.\n\n745\n00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.620\nThere's a part one, there's a part two.\n\n746\n00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.280\nSee them all.\n\n747\n00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:58.110\nWes, wonderful job, and there's all kinds\nof video content in the 8 plus 902 Series.\n\n748\n00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.410\nWatch every single

00:00:10.640\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for watching IT\nPRO TV, helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.590\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with ComTIA A+ 902, and\n\n6\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.160\nwe're gona troubleshoot PC issues.\n\n7\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.220\nAnd the person bringing us all that\ninformation that we need is our IT pro,\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.840\nWes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.840\nWes, good morning, sir,\nand nice to see you.\n\n10\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.870\n&gt;&gt; Man, thanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.571\nThat's right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n12\n00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:34.846\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n13\n00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:36.668\nwe are looking at PC security issues.\n\n14\n00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:40.320\nSpecifically, we've got a couple of\nepisodes that the titles are pretty\n\n15\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.480\ndarn similar, right?\n\n16\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.720\nIn another episode,\n\n17\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.650\nwe talked about troubleshooting some of\nthe common PC issues that you would see.\n\n18\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.800\nJust basically more on the operation and\nfunctionality.\n\n19\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.698\nNow we're gonna be diving\ninto security issues, right?\n\n20\n00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:54.040\nSo don't let these confuse you, right?\n\n21\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.610\nWe have two different objectives\nthat we're tackling here.\n\n22\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.400\nAnd if you're looking for\njust basic functionality, right,\n\n23\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.550\nthen you're gonna definitely wanna\ncheck out the other episode.\n\n24\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.180\nThis one here is giving a scenario of\ntroubleshoot common PC security issues\n\n25\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.310\nwith appropriate tools and best practices.\n\n26\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.290\nAs you can see that we couldn't\nfit that in the title,\n\n27\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.170\nso I'll just read it off to you,\nand again, that is 4.2.\n\n28\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.490\nSo, that is what we're\ngonna talk about today.\n\n29\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.710\nSo let's go ahead,\nwe're gonna dive right in.\n\n30\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.387\nThey do talk about common symptoms, and\nthere are plenty of them out there for us.\n\n31\n00:01:25.387 --> 00:01:28.410\nSo, what are some of the first\nones that we need to talk about?\n\n32\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.570\nWell, this is one that really\nhas kind of gone by the wayside.\n\n33\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.650\nWe don't see it as much today, and that's\nnot to say that you're not gonna see it.\n\n34\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.770\nBut we don't see it by far as much\nas we did maybe ten years ago,\n\n35\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.550\nand that, those are pop-ups, right?\n\n36\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.765\nWe look at pop-ups, pop-ups are definitely\nsomething that we have to worry about.\n\n37\n00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:51.610\nPop-ups can be symptomatic of some kind\nof security issue, it could be adware.\n\n38\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.950\nRemember, that one of\nthe definitions of adware right?\n\n39\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.727\nAdware gets on your system, and what it\ndoes, is it strategically put pop-ups,\n\n40\n00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:00.500\njust all these different\npop-ups up on your screen.\n\n41\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000\nAnd a lot of times it's based on\nyour browsing habits as well too.\n\n42\n00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.800\nYou go to your website, and what happens\nis active X control in Windows, or\n\n43\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.370\na little extension goes to execute, and\n\n44\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.222\nwhen it does its adware\ngets on your machine.\n\n45\n00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:15.490\nAll right, now, there are some\nways that we can combat this.\n\n46\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.196\nNow there are third party utilities\nthat are out there that, well,\n\n47\n00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:22.210\nbasically it'll allow you\nto have pop-up blockers.\n\n48\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.460\nOther things that you can do too,\nyou can have ad blockers.\n\n49\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.800\nAs well, there is one called AdBlocker\nthat I personally, I really like.\n\n50\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.630\nBut I will tell you that also\nthat can reduce, like ad blocker,\n\n51\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.670\nthey can reduce the functionality of\nyour overall browsing experience.\n\n52\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.342\nThe reason I say that is because\nwebsites make money on ads.\n\n53\n00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:42.120\nI mean let's face it,\nthat's how they make their money right?\n\n54\n00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.862\nSo, I'm not telling you that it's\nbad to go to a website that has ads,\n\n55\n00:02:45.862 --> 00:02:48.030\nI mean that's how they're\nmaking their income.\n\n56\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.830\nAnd sometimes what they'll do, is their\nwebsite can actually detect not only,\n\n57\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.020\nusually they can, detect not only the\nbrowser of the version and the update that\n\n58\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.670\nyou're using, but also whether you're\nrunning one of these ad blockers too.\n\n59\n00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.880\nSo keep that in mind that they might say,\nhey,\n\n60\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.520\nif you wanna actually see our website,\nyou gotta turn your ad blocker off.\n\n61\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.130\nBut one of the things you should always\nhave running on your systems are what\n\n62\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.500\nare known as pop-up blockers.\n\n63\n00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.020\nAnd let me show you, I've got our Windows\n8.1 machine that we've been using over\n\n64\n00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.710\nthe past few episodes here.\n\n65\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.544\nThere's Windows 7 as well, but I just\nhappen to be using Windows 8.1 here.\n\n66\n00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:22.377\nLet me go ahead, and let me open\nup our Internet Explorer here, and\n\n67\n00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:25.947\nit's gonna take us right to our\nIT PRO TV website, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:29.122\nOr, it's gonna tell me that\nthere's an error [LAUGH] so\n\n69\n00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:31.616\nthat's a really good way to block pop ups.\n\n70\n00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:34.023\nBut one things that I\ndo wanna show you here,\n\n71\n00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:36.640\nonce this thing actually\ngets started up here.\n\n72\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.750\nAll right, boy that is taking a while,\nthere we go.\n\n73\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.661\nWhat I wanna get into is\nreally the tools here.\n\n74\n00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:49.028\nSo you could see over here on the right\nhand side, if I was to kinda zoom in,\n\n75\n00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.870\nwe have our Internet options.\n\n76\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.390\nRemember, there's a few different\nways you can get to Internet options,\n\n77\n00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.130\nthis is one of the ways you\ncan get to Internet options.\n\n78\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.890\nAnd you've probably seen us talk\nabout this in other episodes.\n\n79\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.480\nNow, sometimes if you get\npop-ups within your website,\n\n80\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.840\nyou can see how, well, it wouldn't\neven allow our website to open up.\n\n81\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.130\nAnd that could be problematic as\nwell when it comes to your browsing.\n\n82\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.160\nSo there's other ways that you can\nensure that your pop-up blocker\n\n83\n00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.550\nis on without having to open the browser.\n\n84\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.890\nSo you don't have to\nwait like we did there.\n\n85\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.650\nSo let me show you how you could do that.\n\n86\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.734\nIf you right-click on your Windows tile,\nand\n\n87\n00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:26.562\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll go to our Control Panel.\n\n88\n00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:31.219\nAll right, and\nwe're going to go to System and Security.\n\n89\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.825\nAnd you know what?\n\n90\n00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:36.830\n[LAUGH] How about we go to the right\nside of the river, Network and\n\n91\n00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.712\nInternet there and Internet options.\n\n92\n00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:41.968\nAgain, make sure that I tell you\nthat right-control panel network and\n\n93\n00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:43.250\nInternet options.\n\n94\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.924\nAnd that brings up our internet\nproperties, they call it,\n\n95\n00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:49.281\nit's the same exact interface here.\n\n96\n00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:51.659\nOther ways that you\ncould open this up too,\n\n97\n00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.570\nyou could do this from your modern UI,\nmetro UI, if you will.\n\n98\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.660\nYou could do inet.charliepapalima,\n\n99\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.397\nor CPL, or actually no dot there,\ninetcpl.cpl.\n\n100\n00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:07.460\nIt's kinda double redundant there and\n\n101\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.910\nyou can see this little batch file or\nexecutable, if you will.\n\n102\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.270\nAnd when that runs, that also runs\nthe same thing, Internet properties.\n\n103\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.080\nSo a few different ways\nto get to your Internet,\n\n104\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.290\nwhat they call Internet properties.\n\n105\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.905\nYou might also see it called internet\noptions if you're gonna browse it\n\n106\n00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.025\nthrough a couple different ways.\n\n107\n00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:27.160\nNow what I'm really worried\nabout here is the privacy tab.\n\n108\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.875\nWe've talked about these different\ntabs in other episodes here.\n\n109\n00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:31.895\nBut if you notice the privacy tab,\nit says,\n\n110\n00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:35.605\nBlock things like third party cookies\nthat don't have privacy policies.\n\n111\n00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:37.355\nBut what I really wanna look at here is,\n\n112\n00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:40.795\nnotice that that pop-up\nblocker is right there.\n\n113\n00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:43.195\nAnd by default this has\nbeen turned on in IE and\n\n114\n00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:44.755\nInternet Explorer for a very long time.\n\n115\n00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:47.660\nUnderstand that Chrome,\nit doesn't matter if you're using Chrome,\n\n116\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.550\nI personally like the Chrome browser,\nit's what I use.\n\n117\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.290\nCuz I use a lot of the Google\nbased technology, so\n\n118\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.050\nit integrates all my technologies,\nintegrates my bookmarks.\n\n119\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.210\nAnd when I install Chrome on another\nmachine my bookmarks are there.\n\n120\n00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.470\nSo again, I don't want this to be a show\nabout Chrome, but that's what I use.\n\n121\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.480\nBut they also have their\nsecurity built in as well, and\n\n122\n00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.860\nyou can see that it's right here.\n\n123\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.110\nWell maybe there's some sites that\nyou want to allow certain pop ups.\n\n124\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.630\nI'm not sure why, but maybe you do.\n\n125\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.040\nIt could be maybe, you're testing\na website, right, for your company.\n\n126\n00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.180\nMaybe you're in a testing environment,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.440\nAnd you might need to add\nsomething like your website here.\n\n128\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.532\nSo I could do something\nlike https if I wanted to,\n\n129\n00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:33.276\nand I could do itpro.tv.\n\n130\n00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:37.100\nAnd if I wanted to I could turn around and\nI could add this site.\n\n131\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.030\nNow, notice that this little\nasterisk symbol is right here,\n\n132\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.910\nand the asterisk symbol is\na basically a wildcard.\n\n133\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.910\nSo if we have demo.itpro.tv,\n\n134\n00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.110\nif we had web.itpro.tv,\neverything would fall under it.\n\n135\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.850\nBasically, the wildcard says,\nanything within that domain, go ahead and\n\n136\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.550\nthrow it in here,\nmake an exception of the rule.\n\n137\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.658\nNow, there are somethings that we can do,\nwe can adjust the levels too.\n\n138\n00:06:59.658 --> 00:07:02.910\nAgain, allow pop-ups from secure sites.\n\n139\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.990\nIn this case, because I put https in\nthere, that would be a secure site.\n\n140\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.021\nAnd then I could say you know what,\nno, block all pop-ups,\n\n141\n00:07:10.021 --> 00:07:13.520\nevery single pop-up that you want,\njust go ahead and block it.\n\n142\n00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.503\nSo those are things that can be telltale\nsigns that you might have an issue.\n\n143\n00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:22.890\nRun it again as if there are pop-ups\nthat are coming up on your interface.\n\n144\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.760\nTypically, usually a lot of times,\nit's with your browsing habits.\n\n145\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.630\nIf they do start to happen\noutside of your browser,\n\n146\n00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.600\nthen chances are you do have some\nkind of nasty adware on your machine.\n\n147\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.727\nAt this point, what you're gonna\nwanna do is run some anti-malware or\n\n148\n00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:44.580\nanti-virus software,\nwhich we'll talk about here in a bit.\n\n149\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.720\nNow the other thing that could happen,\ntoo, with your browsing habits,\n\n150\n00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.660\nagain, with browsers in general,\nis what's known as browser redirection.\n\n151\n00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.100\nI've seen this happen.\n\n152\n00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.987\nAnd that's where you do something,\nfor instance,\n\n153\n00:07:57.987 --> 00:08:00.557\nmaybe firing up your web browser.\n\n154\n00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:04.944\nAnd when you fire up your web browser,\ninstead of it taking you out to your site,\n\n155\n00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:08.430\nin fact, I've kinda got like\na browser redirection going on.\n\n156\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.608\nLet me see if I can recreate that again.\n\n157\n00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:13.136\nIt should get an error hopefully.\n\n158\n00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:17.868\nAnd now, I don't get the error, that\nfigures, let me try one more time here.\n\n159\n00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:22.573\nBrowser redirections are, again,\ndefinitely a symptom that,\n\n160\n00:08:22.573 --> 00:08:24.830\nof some kind of virus, right.\n\n161\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:30.890\nThis can happen as well, let me go ahead\nand delete my history here real quick.\n\n162\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.190\nAnd see if I can cause that\nerror to happen one more time.\n\n163\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.210\nAnd then what you'll see is essentially\nwhere you think you should be going to\n\n164\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.200\nlike your homepage, you can see that\nmy homepage is https here in our\n\n165\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.061\ngeneral settings and\nInternet properties or Internet options.\n\n166\n00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:52.436\nYou can see where my homepage should be,\nand unfortunately when I open the web\n\n167\n00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:57.160\nbrowser, it doesn't take me there, it\ntakes me somewhere else, and there we go.\n\n168\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.301\nAll right, so, notice that I'm\ngetting this 404 Error, right.\n\n169\n00:09:01.301 --> 00:09:02.855\nThey're not finding the webpage, right.\n\n170\n00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.811\nOr it could be that it takes\nyou to a website, you're like,\n\n171\n00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.610\nwait a second, I don't usually browse\nto that website, what's going on?\n\n172\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.463\nAgain, that could be a telltale sign\nthat you've got some kind of browser\n\n173\n00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:13.070\nredirection.\n\n174\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.535\nAnd what happens a lot of times is when\nyou get some kind of adware, spyware, or\n\n175\n00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:18.626\ngeneral malware.\n\n176\n00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:21.728\nYou'll notice that if you go\ninto your Internet options,\n\n177\n00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.520\nthat your homepage has changed.\n\n178\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.186\nNow, understand it's probably\nnever gonna be this obvious.\n\n179\n00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:30.770\nBut you might come in here and\nsee something like,\n\n180\n00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.167\nhttp://ijustgothacked.com.\n\n181\n00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:37.811\nRight, now, obviously it's probably\nnot gonna be that [LAUGH] obvious,\n\n182\n00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:41.847\nI should say, but it might-\n&gt;&gt; Hahathejokesonyou.com.\n\n183\n00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.614\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, absolutely, Zach.\n\n184\n00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:47.881\nSo one of the things that you can do when\nthat happens, again I would say run your\n\n185\n00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:51.506\nanti-malware software,\nrun something like Windows Defender,\n\n186\n00:09:51.506 --> 00:09:54.627\nrun something like Malwarebytes,\nSymantec, Norton.\n\n187\n00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.690\nThere's a lot of them that are out there.\n\n188\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.080\nAnd then I would also\ncome back in here and\n\n189\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.965\nwhat I would do is reset your homepage,\nif you have to, and\n\n190\n00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:10.373\nagain, one of the things I could do,\njust like this right here.\n\n191\n00:10:10.373 --> 00:10:13.614\nSo, see here, go ahead and\nchoose Apply and\n\n192\n00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:18.640\nthen hopefully when I hit my home button,\nwhat happens is, oop.\n\n193\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.280\nAnd it looks like I did\nnot spell that right,\n\n194\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.455\ncuz apparently they're trying\nto sell me our website.\n\n195\n00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead [LAUGH],\n\n196\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.762\nlet's go ahead and try that again.\n\n197\n00:10:25.762 --> 00:10:26.718\n&gt;&gt; That's not such a bad thing.\n\n198\n00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:28.576\n&gt;&gt; Swing and\na miss right there on camera, right?\n\n199\n00:10:28.576 --> 00:10:30.100\nSo what did I do here?\n\n200\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.200\nIT dot.\n\n201\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.680\nYou gotta spell your,\n\n202\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.160\nyou do have to spell your homepage right\nif you want it to go to the right page.\n\n203\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.615\nSo browser redirections\ncould be user error, too.\n\n204\n00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:43.369\n[LAUGH] So let's see if that works.\n\n205\n00:10:43.369 --> 00:10:45.545\nAll right, and we'll start it over here.\n\n206\n00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:48.008\nIt's caching some stuff in the background,\nagain,\n\n207\n00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:50.203\ntrying to simulate that\nbrowser redirection.\n\n208\n00:10:50.203 --> 00:10:53.570\nBut again, that kinda gives you\nan idea of what could happen.\n\n209\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.294\nA browser redirection is something that is\na telltale sign that you have some kind\n\n210\n00:10:58.294 --> 00:11:01.986\nof, not necessarily, maybe,\na very bad, malicious virus.\n\n211\n00:11:01.986 --> 00:11:06.620\nIt could be just something as simple as\nadware that could also produce pop-ups.\n\n212\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.034\nNow, what else do we have, right?\n\n213\n00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:12.110\nSome of the other things that we have\nto worry about are security alerts.\n\n214\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.460\nSecurity alerts do happen.\n\n215\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.280\nInside of Windows Vista, it would have\nbeen what's known as the Security Center.\n\n216\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.420\nAs of Windows 7 and beyond,\nit would be known as the Action Center.\n\n217\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.050\nAnd this is a good thing to be aware of,\nright?\n\n218\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.869\nSometimes you'll see that maybe there's\na virus that's present too, and\n\n219\n00:11:28.869 --> 00:11:32.271\nthis could be the fact that your\nanti-malware system or software or\n\n220\n00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:35.088\nanti-virus software is\nactually catching the virus.\n\n221\n00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:39.080\nAnd it's throwing you a warning that says\nhey, you need to do something about this.\n\n222\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.690\nBut it doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it's caught a virus too.\n\n223\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.298\nIt could be the fact that you've\nmade a configuration change, or\n\n224\n00:11:45.298 --> 00:11:48.317\nsome configuration has\nhappened to your machine, and\n\n225\n00:11:48.317 --> 00:11:51.749\nit's reduced the overall\nsecurity of the operating system.\n\n226\n00:11:51.749 --> 00:11:54.102\nLet me show you what I mean,\nI can actually tell and\n\n227\n00:11:54.102 --> 00:11:55.391\nkinda demonstrate this and\n\n228\n00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:59.386\nhopefully it goes over a little bit better\nthan the browser redirection and my typo.\n\n229\n00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.290\nBut my head's gonna covering this one up.\n\n230\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.402\nAnd I'll kinda show what we can do here.\n\n231\n00:12:03.402 --> 00:12:07.120\nLet me go to our services console.\n\n232\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.960\nNow understand that i'm going\nto be implementing this and\n\n233\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.020\nkinda doing this one on purpose and\n\n234\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.505\nI do see that it is,\nour firewall service is started.\n\n235\n00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.021\nNeeds to be started, I should say.\n\n236\n00:12:21.021 --> 00:12:25.063\nNow, watch what happens here in the lower\nright hand corner of the screen where my\n\n237\n00:12:25.063 --> 00:12:26.020\nhand is right now.\n\n238\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.920\nIf I end up Disabling this and\nI choose Apply, and\n\n239\n00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.641\nthen I choose Stop,\nnotice what we have here.\n\n240\n00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:37.806\nWe've got a security alert that says\nthe Windows Firewall is turned off,\n\n241\n00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:39.161\ntap or click to turn on.\n\n242\n00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:42.276\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and notice that\nit tells me, here's another alert.\n\n243\n00:12:42.276 --> 00:12:46.091\nAnd remember I told you Action Center\ninside of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\n\n244\n00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:48.260\nThis would have been in\nSecurity Center in Vista.\n\n245\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.080\nAll right, so it's telling me,\nhey, you've got an issue here,\n\n246\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.240\nyou need to check it out.\n\n247\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.430\nNow let me also show you another\nplace that this might happen, or\n\n248\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.530\nwhere you can see the warnings there.\n\n249\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.311\nIf I right-click on my Windows charm,\nand I choose Control Panel, System and\n\n250\n00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:05.045\nSecurity.\n\n251\n00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:08.278\nKeep in mind that this would not be\ncalled, I can't stress that enough,\n\n252\n00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:11.353\njust for the exam, this wouldn't\nbe called Action Center in Vista,\n\n253\n00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:15.038\nit would be called Security Center, but\nyou'd see a lot of the same information.\n\n254\n00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:19.392\nNotice that we've got this security\ninformation here, and it's saying, hey,\n\n255\n00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:21.346\nyou need to turn the firewall on, and\n\n256\n00:13:21.346 --> 00:13:23.950\nnotice that it is\nan administrative privilege.\n\n257\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.484\nRemember, one of the things, and\nhere's a great thing to notice, too,\n\n258\n00:13:28.484 --> 00:13:31.794\nnotice I just turn it on and\nit says I can't turn it on.\n\n259\n00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:33.030\nWhy?\n\n260\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.958\nWell, then it really isn't\nthe firewall that can't be turned on.\n\n261\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.330\nIt's actually the service that you've\nseen in the background that I disabled.\n\n262\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:45.910\nNow, viruses and malware will do that, and\nyou have to know how you'd remedy that.\n\n263\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.960\nIn this case, I would go, and you guys\nseen that I did it manually myself here.\n\n264\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.395\nBut please understand that\nviruses can also do this too, so\n\n265\n00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:57.065\nit is good to know where to fix this.\n\n266\n00:13:57.065 --> 00:14:02.720\nServices.msc or inside of Computer\nManagement you can also find that too.\n\n267\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.165\nNotice that when I turn on the firewall,\nright,\n\n268\n00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:11.722\nI can turn the startup type to automatic,\nwhich is what we want, we choose OK.\n\n269\n00:14:11.722 --> 00:14:15.362\nAnd even though it is running,\nlet me just double check.\n\n270\n00:14:15.362 --> 00:14:18.133\nCuz all I did was change the service,\n\n271\n00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:23.330\nI changed the firewall properties\nthere to start up automatically.\n\n272\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.501\nWhat I didn't do is\nactually start the service.\n\n273\n00:14:25.501 --> 00:14:29.594\nSo once I start the service,\nall right, then you wanna go back and\n\n274\n00:14:29.594 --> 00:14:31.901\nyou wanna check out your firewall and\n\n275\n00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:36.755\ncontrol panel to verify if it is running\nor if it just turned to the service on.\n\n276\n00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:37.807\nThat's, again,\n\n277\n00:14:37.807 --> 00:14:42.770\nthe underlying process that really runs\nthe Windows Firewall in the background.\n\n278\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.710\nRight clicking on our Windows charm here,\nWindows tile,\n\n279\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.910\nwe're gonna choose Control Panel.\n\n280\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.640\nWe're gonna go back to System and\nSecurity.\n\n281\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.860\nThe Windows Firewall and\nI can see that, yes,\n\n282\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.820\nthe firewall is on and I am connected\nto one of the profiles, right?\n\n283\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.125\nSo, if I wanted to see whether it was\non or off, I could see that right here.\n\n284\n00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:05.850\nBut I can also see this\nfrom the Action Center.\n\n285\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.283\nNotice when I go into Action Center,\n\n286\n00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:13.707\nit doesn't give me that security alert\nanymore that says that my firewall is off.\n\n287\n00:15:13.707 --> 00:15:16.237\nNow, notice the other security\nalert that happens too.\n\n288\n00:15:16.237 --> 00:15:20.883\nNotice it says that Windows Defender\nneeds to scan your computer as well, and\n\n289\n00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:25.813\nit also gives me some information about\nthe various dynamic security that is built\n\n290\n00:15:25.813 --> 00:15:26.810\ninto Windows.\n\n291\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.890\nAnd when these are modified,\nsometimes you will get security alerts.\n\n292\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.120\nAnd let's just kinda look\nat them individually here.\n\n293\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.208\nBecause, since this is\na security-related episode,\n\n294\n00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:39.241\nyou do want to kind of know\nsome of these settings here.\n\n295\n00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:41.802\nNotice that it does tell\nme the firewall is on.\n\n296\n00:15:41.802 --> 00:15:44.417\nPatch management is\nsomething that you need,\n\n297\n00:15:44.417 --> 00:15:48.978\ncuz remember inside of Windows Update and\npatch management we have hot fixes that\n\n298\n00:15:48.978 --> 00:15:52.936\nare basically security patches that\nfix known functionality flaws,\n\n299\n00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:56.380\nexploitable vulnerabilities,\npatch the system, right.\n\n300\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.780\nWe put a patch over the hole in the dam,\nif you will.\n\n301\n00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.666\nNotice that virus protection,\nit does say that it's on.\n\n302\n00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:11.270\nHowever, it says it's on, but it also\nsays that we need to do something, right?\n\n303\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.671\nSo, we need to schedule scans,\n\n304\n00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.700\nand we'll show you a little more about\nWindows Defender coming up here.\n\n305\n00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.290\nNotice that spyware unwanted\nsoftware protection is on.\n\n306\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.070\nWell unwanted software protection is\nanother part of the dynamic security\n\n307\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.340\nthat's built into Windows that can\nalso be disabled if you have a virus.\n\n308\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.600\nLet me show you where that is.\n\n309\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.100\nIf we open up our Internet Explorer,\nand, again,\n\n310\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.500\nmy browser redirection's still\nhappening there in the background.\n\n311\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.743\nI'll have to reset that\nafter the show's over.\n\n312\n00:16:36.743 --> 00:16:41.724\nBut if I go ahead and\nI go back to our Internet Options,\n\n313\n00:16:41.724 --> 00:16:47.920\nyou're gonna notice that there is,\nright here, Security.\n\n314\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.600\nOkay, so there's a couple\nof things I wanna show you.\n\n315\n00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.080\nEnabling Protected Mode,\n\n316\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.000\nif this is disabled understand\nthat what protected mode is.\n\n317\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.190\nIs a quarantined portion of your system\nmemory that says Internet Explorer can\n\n318\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.240\nsend a code there, but\nit can't execute it, right?\n\n319\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.005\nIt's the way,\nInternet Explorer protects itself.\n\n320\n00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:08.105\nIt says, okay, I don't mind you using\nthis code, but when you throw that\n\n321\n00:17:08.105 --> 00:17:12.015\ncode in there, you're not gonna\nbe able to execute it in any way.\n\n322\n00:17:12.015 --> 00:17:13.575\nSo, again, protected mode is good.\n\n323\n00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.690\nIt's kinda like the industry\nstandard that we call NX.\n\n324\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.870\nThe no execute bit, or\ndata execution protection.\n\n325\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:24.850\nIt's also built into Windows as well,\nso, do keep that in mind.\n\n326\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.390\nBut, it's not exactly what\nI wanted to show you.\n\n327\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.030\nNotice that we have the safety option\nhere, this is where I wanted to go.\n\n328\n00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.230\nSo many different pieces\nof dynamic security here.\n\n329\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.300\nIt is good to know on multiple levels.\n\n330\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.402\nNotice if I go to safety here and\nkinda scroll over,\n\n331\n00:17:40.402 --> 00:17:44.290\nall right,\nthere is this Turn off SmartScreen Filter.\n\n332\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.760\nNow I don't wanna do that,\nthat lets me know that it's on.\n\n333\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.081\nBut SmartScreen Filter is something\nthat has been built into Windows for\n\n334\n00:17:51.081 --> 00:17:53.540\na good long while now, and\nit does a couple of things.\n\n335\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.660\nOne of the things it does is every time\nyou visit a website, the website's URL,\n\n336\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.230\nthe Uniform Resource Locator that's in\nthe address bar, is sent to Microsoft and\n\n337\n00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.990\nchecked, if you will,\nagainst a reputation database.\n\n338\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:11.200\nAnd that reputation database is basically\na database of known websites for\n\n339\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.230\nvulnerabilities, and phishing scams,\nand malware distribution,\n\n340\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.760\nif you will, unsafe software downloads.\n\n341\n00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.930\nAnd if it is found that\nit is in that list,\n\n342\n00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.270\nit's gonna throw a little red warning\nhere, a red bar across the address bar and\n\n343\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.140\nsay, hey, you're gonna wanna\nnavigate away from this site.\n\n344\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.790\nIt's not recommended, if you want to, you\ncan continue, but we don't recommend it.\n\n345\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.260\nThe other thing that's really\ncool about SmartScreen Filter\n\n346\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.140\nis it also looks at software.\n\n347\n00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.050\nSoftware that you would\ndownload over the internet.\n\n348\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:45.370\nAnd it checks digital signatures and\nit checks that reputation database.\n\n349\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.030\nAnd if it’s potentially unsafe,\nit’s gonna warn you about it.\n\n350\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.676\nSay, hey, you don't want, you don't\nactually wanna run this software.\n\n351\n00:18:51.676 --> 00:18:54.610\nSo know that that is\nsomething that’s there and\n\n352\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.750\nit can also produce security\nalerts if it is turned on.\n\n353\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.480\nIt is, certainly something that\nyou don't want to turn off.\n\n354\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.980\nSo those are some of the additional\ninternet security settings that are set to\n\n355\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.000\ntheir recommended levels.\n\n356\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.230\nWe can see that that's turned on,\nwe want it turned on.\n\n357\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.330\nMore so, notice SmartScreen,\nI just talked about right here.\n\n358\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.390\nYou can actually see some of the things\nthat it tells you right here.\n\n359\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.970\nSmartScreen is helping protect\nyour PC from unrecognized apps and\n\n360\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.100\nfiles that are downloaded\nfrom the Internet.\n\n361\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.420\nI can also click the hyperlink right here,\nand if I do, hey, imagine that.\n\n362\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.765\nNotice that this is another part of\nthis SmartScreen filter that we've\n\n363\n00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:32.405\ntalked about.\n\n364\n00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:34.235\nOne side of the tracks is the URLs.\n\n365\n00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:38.765\nThe other side of the tracks that is\nalso built into the software is, really,\n\n366\n00:19:38.765 --> 00:19:40.685\nlooking at applications.\n\n367\n00:19:40.685 --> 00:19:44.860\nNotice that is says, get administrative\napproval before running unrecognized apps.\n\n368\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.620\nWell, how do we recognize them,\nand how do we not recognize them?\n\n369\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.670\nWell, you recognize your apps because they\nhave a digital security stamp on them,\n\n370\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.350\nwe call it digital signatures.\n\n371\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.398\nAnd those of you that are going on in more\nadvanced training in security training,\n\n372\n00:19:56.398 --> 00:19:58.137\nyou'll learn what\na digital certificate is.\n\n373\n00:19:58.137 --> 00:20:02.798\nIt's essentially an electronic signature,\nthink of it as seal of approval that is\n\n374\n00:20:02.798 --> 00:20:05.340\nput on an application,\na piece of software.\n\n375\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.220\nThat seal of approval can be\nchecked by an external source.\n\n376\n00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.248\nWe can relate that information\nto what Windows is aware of, and\n\n377\n00:20:12.248 --> 00:20:15.138\nit says, yeah, yeah, I recognize that.\n\n378\n00:20:15.138 --> 00:20:17.627\nSo for instance, if I wanted to know hey,\n\n379\n00:20:17.627 --> 00:20:21.020\ndelivery confirmation\ninside of my Snail Mail.\n\n380\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.610\nRight, well the United States Postal\nService would put a stamp on it.\n\n381\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.260\nWell, I trust\nthe United States Postal Service,\n\n382\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.030\nbecause giving what their industry is,\nright.\n\n383\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.095\nSo, we're basically, we can check the fact\nthat that digital signature says,\n\n384\n00:20:34.095 --> 00:20:36.700\nhey, I know who this software came from.\n\n385\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.870\nAnd then more so, that I know that the\nsoftware hasn't been modified in any way.\n\n386\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.050\nOne of the other ones here if we could\nshow that just for a second longer.\n\n387\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.160\nWarn before running any unrecognized app,\nbut\n\n388\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.850\ndon't require administrative\nlevel approval.\n\n389\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.350\nBe careful, the reason I say that\nis because you always implement\n\n390\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.680\nthe principle of least\nprivilege in your computers.\n\n391\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.230\nIf you only give the privileges\n\n392\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.660\nthat are necessary to do your\nday-to-day functions, right?\n\n393\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.360\nIf you give a standard user the ability\nto download and run an app,\n\n394\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.546\nit won't be long before you have 30\ntool bars in the Internet Explorer.\n\n395\n00:21:12.546 --> 00:21:15.495\nAnd every time it opens up,\nit takes about 30 minutes to open up.\n\n396\n00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:18.067\nBecause all the things that\nare running in the background,\n\n397\n00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:20.700\nbecause they didn't realize,\nhey, it said I could run it.\n\n398\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.182\nWhy not just click Next, Next,\nNext, Next, or OK, OK, OK, OK.\n\n399\n00:21:23.182 --> 00:21:27.030\nAnd before you know it,\nyou've got a compromised system.\n\n400\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.710\nAnd then certainly we don't wanna\nturn off the SmartScreen Filter.\n\n401\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:36.180\nSo, some of the security alerts that you\ncould see inside of your operating system.\n\n402\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.668\nNow another one I wanna kinda show you,\ntoo, is, well, what would\n\n403\n00:21:41.668 --> 00:21:47.754\nhappen if you see some kind of security\nalert that indicates I have a virus.\n\n404\n00:21:47.754 --> 00:21:52.040\nWell let me kinda show you what I mean\nhere, we can actually kinda simulate this.\n\n405\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.490\nNow I'm gonna let you know I'm\nnot infecting this machine.\n\n406\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.850\nIt's gonna look like I'm\ngonna infect this machine.\n\n407\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.600\nBut this is actually a test\nthat you can do yourself.\n\n408\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.800\nYou can go out and can check it out.\n\n409\n00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.750\nIt's called the EICAR virus string.\n\n410\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.585\nIt's essentially,\n\n411\n00:22:08.585 --> 00:22:13.573\nwhat a whole bunch of security\nmanufacturers did is they got together.\n\n412\n00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:16.587\nAnd all these anti-malware companies said,\nhey,\n\n413\n00:22:16.587 --> 00:22:20.640\nis there a way we can just classify\nthis string of text as being a virus?\n\n414\n00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.760\nJust so we can test whether\nthe antivirus software is working?\n\n415\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.019\nAnd that's what they did, so\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n416\n00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:30.330\nNow my head's gonna kinda cover this up,\nbecause this happens really quick here.\n\n417\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.140\nSometimes it happens in\nthe lower right-hand corner.\n\n418\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.580\nSometimes it's the upper right-hand\ncorner, can't really tell which one.\n\n419\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.410\nAnd then, notice here what we have,\nall right?\n\n420\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:44.050\nNow, notice that it tells me it found some\nMalware, Windows Defender is removing it.\n\n421\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.390\nAlso, understand that it says,\nit gives me this little security alert\n\n422\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.950\nthat says unexpected error is\nkeeping you from copying this file.\n\n423\n00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.860\nIf you continue, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n424\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.160\nIt doesn't really say\nblah blah blah blah blah,\n\n425\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.770\nbut that's how I'm gonna interpret it.\n\n426\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:01.650\nBut notice the error, it says the\noperation did not complete successfully,\n\n427\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.184\nbecause the file contains a virus or\npotentially unwanted software.\n\n428\n00:23:05.184 --> 00:23:08.510\nAnd we could try again and\ntry again and it's not gonna work.\n\n429\n00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.880\nSo pay attention to your security alerts.\n\n430\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.353\nRemember that security alerts\nare important to keep an eye on.\n\n431\n00:23:14.353 --> 00:23:18.240\nAnd that's probably another thing that\nI want you to be aware of as well.\n\n432\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.750\nLet me go ahead and\nclose this down here now that we've seen.\n\n433\n00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.038\nAgain ladies and gentlemen, that wasn't\nactually a virus, understand that.\n\n434\n00:23:25.038 --> 00:23:28.330\nActually, I'll tell you what,\nI can kinda show you guys.\n\n435\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.020\nSo you what that is in the background,\nhere.\n\n436\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.630\nLet me go ahead and I'm on my Macbook\nhere, Mac doesn't react to it.\n\n437\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.260\nBut essentially,\n\n438\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.750\nthis is just a string of text here\nthat the virus manufacturer said,\n\n439\n00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.910\nhey, let's put this characters together\nand we'll just recognize that as a virus.\n\n440\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.398\nAnd the only thing we're using it for\n\n441\n00:23:48.398 --> 00:23:50.712\nis the test that you're\nantivirus software is running.\n\n442\n00:23:50.712 --> 00:23:53.400\nIt's not actually a virus,\nbut it's a great way.\n\n443\n00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.614\nAnd I would encourage you guys out there,\nif you wanna try it out and\n\n444\n00:23:56.614 --> 00:23:59.151\nmake sure that your antivirus\nsoftware is running.\n\n445\n00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:02.698\nThat it is actually functioning,\nit's a great way to test it.\n\n446\n00:24:02.698 --> 00:24:04.663\n&gt;&gt; So just a real quick question,\ncuz you're doing great, and\n\n447\n00:24:04.663 --> 00:24:06.680\nI don't wanna interrupt your\nstream of consciousness here.\n\n448\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.403\nBut Windows has so much built in security.\n\n449\n00:24:10.403 --> 00:24:13.796\nI know you mentioned before getting\nsome outside antivirus, like Norton and\n\n450\n00:24:13.796 --> 00:24:14.325\nwhatever.\n\n451\n00:24:14.325 --> 00:24:18.716\nI mean, is it really that important or\ncan you just let Windows do its thing?\n\n452\n00:24:18.716 --> 00:24:21.805\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nnow you opened a whole can of worms there.\n\n453\n00:24:21.805 --> 00:24:23.326\nAnd let me tell you why.\n\n454\n00:24:23.326 --> 00:24:24.575\nThat is a great question.\n\n455\n00:24:24.575 --> 00:24:27.676\nIt's a long debate, so\nI'll put it this way.\n\n456\n00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:33.670\nSo if I buy a car, right?\n\n457\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.830\nIf i buy the car,\n\n458\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:41.290\ndoes the sound system that come with\nit work, if I buy a brand new car?\n\n459\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.230\nWell, yeah, right?\n\n460\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.800\nThe sound system works, but\ndo I want a better sound system?\n\n461\n00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n462\n00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.820\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe all always want better sounds, right?\n\n463\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.990\nBetter music,\nI know were both music fans, right?\n\n464\n00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.607\nSo what do you do?\n\n465\n00:24:50.607 --> 00:24:54.450\nYou go out and\nyou purchase a better sound system, right?\n\n466\n00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.529\nBut the one that came with the car is\nfine, you can listen to music, right?\n\n467\n00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:01.397\nSo the stance is at least\nWindows has built in and\n\n468\n00:25:01.397 --> 00:25:04.598\nyou're protected going out the gate.\n\n469\n00:25:04.598 --> 00:25:05.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We got software.\n\n470\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.720\nIt's onboard.\n\n471\n00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.230\nIt's protected going out the gate.\n\n472\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.282\nYou don't have to go to a third party.\n\n473\n00:25:11.282 --> 00:25:12.890\nNow does the third party\nmake better software?\n\n474\n00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.920\nProbably most of the time yes, because\nit's their bread and butter, right?\n\n475\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.060\nIf you go to a security place like McAfee,\n\n476\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.970\nKaspersky, I know it's debatable,\nSemantic, right?\n\n477\n00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.690\nAnd again, everybody has what they\nlike and what they don't like.\n\n478\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.380\nYou're probably gonna get\na better piece of software than\n\n479\n00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.670\nsomething like Windows Defender,\nright, cuz Windows Defender, and\n\n480\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.240\nhonestly all I run is Windows Defender.\n\n481\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.630\nAnd Microsoft Security Essentials,\nwhich today, Windows Defender and\n\n482\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.960\nMicrosoft Security Essentials\nare essentially the same.\n\n483\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.100\nBoy, that's redundant.\n\n484\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.420\nAnd they're built in together.\n\n485\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.630\nBut the point is, I didn't have to pay for\nanything, and it does a very,\n\n486\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.890\nvery good job of caching what I need.\n\n487\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.960\nSo to answer your question, yes you can.\n\n488\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.940\nYou can let Windows just do its thing.\n\n489\n00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.908\nCan you get better functionality and\nmaybe additional functionality?\n\n490\n00:25:56.908 --> 00:25:59.490\nIt's not build in Windows defender\nby going to a third party?\n\n491\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.580\nYeah, absolutely-\n&gt;&gt; Better safe than sorry.\n\n492\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n493\n00:26:02.188 --> 00:26:03.907\nSo hopefully that answers your question.\n\n494\n00:26:03.907 --> 00:26:05.580\n&gt;&gt; It does, thank you.\n\n495\n00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.890\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead real quick, and\n\n496\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.880\nlet me show you where I would follow up\nwith my anti-malware or anti-software.\n\n497\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.222\nI know we're coming up\nto time on this one, and\n\n498\n00:26:13.222 --> 00:26:15.032\nwe'll probably go into a part two.\n\n499\n00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:16.630\n[LAUGH] Let me show you here ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n500\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.740\nSo I'm gonna dive back down\ninto my Windows Command Prompt.\n\n501\n00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:25.990\nActually, we'll use the luxury\nof the modern UI here, Metro UI.\n\n502\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.000\nAnd I'm just going to type Defend, and\n\n503\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.610\nwe'll bring up Defender and\nit does tell me, right?\n\n504\n00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.489\nHere's another kind of security warning,\nthat's not giving me a pop-up, but\n\n505\n00:26:35.489 --> 00:26:36.304\nit is letting me know.\n\n506\n00:26:36.304 --> 00:26:37.396\nHey, you need to scan this now.\n\n507\n00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:42.313\nBut what I want to kind of do is go over\nto history, and history is viewed only\n\n508\n00:26:42.313 --> 00:26:46.390\nthrough administrative privileges,\nand you could see why.\n\n509\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.400\nIt says to help protect privacy of users,\nthese items are hidden.\n\n510\n00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.000\nThere could be potentially\nprivate information here that\n\n511\n00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.770\nwe don't just want anybody seeing.\n\n512\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.640\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and view details.\n\n513\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.210\nAnd it looks like it\nalready quarantined it.\n\n514\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.470\nAnd it looks like it\nalready removed it too.\n\n515\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.090\nSo let me try that one more time.\n\n516\n00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.417\nWe're gonna try to trick it,\nokay, so there we go.\n\n517\n00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:14.258\nI've got another copy, I've got\na couple of copies [INAUDIBLE] strand.\n\n518\n00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.440\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna open this text.\n\n519\n00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.478\nAnd I tell you what, let's go ahead and\nlet's do a custom scan here.\n\n520\n00:27:23.478 --> 00:27:29.633\nAnd I'll do a scan now, and we're gonna\ndo this to the E Drive, my data drive,\n\n521\n00:27:29.633 --> 00:27:34.780\nand yeah, we'll just leave it like\nthat and we'll do a scan now.\n\n522\n00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.852\nIs it doing it?\n\n523\n00:27:35.852 --> 00:27:40.960\nOkay, well, let me try that again.\n\n524\n00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.540\nI'll do the recycle bin as well.\n\n525\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.410\nAnd it doesn't seem like it is scanning.\n\n526\n00:27:48.923 --> 00:27:53.610\nOkay, we're gonna try that one\nmore time here, review details.\n\n527\n00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.092\nNo, it isn't doing it.\n\n528\n00:27:55.092 --> 00:27:58.872\nSo all right, let's go ahead and\ncopy this over here and maybe it will so\n\n529\n00:27:58.872 --> 00:27:59.760\nthe same thing.\n\n530\n00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.690\nWhat I'd like to show you is the history\nthat is in Windows Defender.\n\n531\n00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.430\nIt does look like that\nit caught it that time.\n\n532\n00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.490\nAnd I do have a default action that says,\nhey,\n\n533\n00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.740\nif you found a virus,\ntake care of it for me.\n\n534\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.870\nDon't wait for me to do it,\nbut let's see here.\n\n535\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.880\nNo, all detected items, view detail.\n\n536\n00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.840\nThere we go.\nSo okay,\n\n537\n00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.820\nI just had to change my view here,\ncuz it isn't quarantined.\n\n538\n00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.940\nIt actually, it applied a default action.\n\n539\n00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.890\nIf it is a highly vulnerable virus or\n\n540\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.390\na high level security risk,\njust take care of it for me.\n\n541\n00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.750\nDon't quarantine it, don't wait for\nme to do anything to it, take care of it.\n\n542\n00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.140\nSo that’s why I had to do.\n\n543\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.245\nI had to look at all detected items.\n\n544\n00:28:41.245 --> 00:28:42.210\nAd right here,\n\n545\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:47.180\nI can see that the file can't be accessed,\n[INAUDIBLE] using by another process.\n\n546\n00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.890\nNotice that we have a virus\nseverity level here.\n\n547\n00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.950\nIt said, if quarantine and\nthe detection method as well is standard.\n\n548\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.840\nAnd really, all I gotta do from here is,\n\n549\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.550\nI could remove it from\nthe history as well here too.\n\n550\n00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.720\nSo that brings me to my next point,\nkinda lost my train of thought there,\n\n551\n00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.660\nbecause sometimes with a secure Alerts.\n\n552\n00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.910\nWhat can happen is you can say,\ndon't alert me.\n\n553\n00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.820\nJust go ahead and\ntake care of the problem.\n\n554\n00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.335\nThis also happens in the Windows firewall,\nand let me show you what I mean here too.\n\n555\n00:29:15.335 --> 00:29:20.023\nIf I go down to Control Panel, System and\nSecurity, the Windows firewall,\n\n556\n00:29:20.023 --> 00:29:24.120\nlet me close this down and\ngive us a little more real estate.\n\n557\n00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.075\nNotice that we have notification settings,\nall right?\n\n558\n00:29:27.075 --> 00:29:31.462\nAnd it tells me notify me when a Windows\nfirewall blocks a new app, and\n\n559\n00:29:31.462 --> 00:29:35.320\nwe've got it notify, notify,\nnotify, all the way down for\n\n560\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.609\nevery one of the network profiles.\n\n561\n00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.150\nSome people say, don't notify me,\nbecause I don't wanna be interrupted.\n\n562\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.600\nWell, I'm of the mind set I wanna know\n\n563\n00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.720\nwhen something's being blocked and\nhere's why.\n\n564\n00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.050\nIf you're never aware of the fact,\nyou might be under attack and\n\n565\n00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:50.822\nyou don't even know it.\n\n566\n00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:53.340\nYou might have something like Trojan,\nthat's\n\n567\n00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.770\ntrying to download into your computer and\npave the way for another attack.\n\n568\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.720\nYou might have some kind of worm that's\nsitting outside of your network adapter\n\n569\n00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.480\nthat's trying to make it's way on to\nyour computer, and then replicate,\n\n570\n00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.110\nuse your resources.\n\n571\n00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.450\nAnd if things keep getting blocked and\n\n572\n00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.540\nyou're not aware of it you, out of sight\nout of mind, I don't know what's going on.\n\n573\n00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.140\nSo I would say that when it\ncomes to security alerts,\n\n574\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.790\nmake sure that you aware of the situation.\n\n575\n00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.730\nDon't disable security alerts.\n\n576\n00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.570\nMaybe you don't have to have them so\nintrusive, but definitely with\n\n577\n00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.370\nthe severity level being on high,\nyou should be aware of all of those.\n\n578\n00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.080\nSo a couple of things you can do,\nagain, pop-ups, browser redirection,\n\n579\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.930\nsecurity alerts.\n\n580\n00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.850\nA lot of other things that we\nhave to talk about here Zach, but\n\n581\n00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.809\nit looks like I have talked way too much.\n\n582\n00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:35.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You did a great job.\n\n583\n00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.030\nTroubleshoot PC Security Issues Comptia

good?\n\n587\n00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.670\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we're good.\n\n588\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.980\nWe're gonna go ahead, we're gonna leave\nthem with a cliffhanger on this one.\n\n589\n00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.990\nYou'll have to come back to part two to\nsee what we're gonna talk about next.\n\n590\n00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.710\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Wes, awesome job.\n\n591\n00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.680\nHey and thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n592\n00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.614\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n593\n00:30:56.614 -->

00:00:08.321\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:12.138\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:14.654\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:17.000\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.328\nI'm Zach Memos your host as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA plus 902\n\n8\n00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:24.356\ntroubleshoot PCs security\nsystems part two.\n\n9\n00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:26.260\nThere was a part one,\nhopefully you saw that.\n\n10\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.060\nThis is part two whose is bringing us\nall of this information that we need,\n\n11\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.710\nWes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.690\nWes, good to see you again sir.\n\n13\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay and thanks for\nhaving me back Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.430\nThat's right, we're gonna be moving\ninto more of those PC security issues.\n\n15\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.630\nAnd in the first part\nwe talked about well,\n\n16\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.100\njust a couple of things that\ncan really affect your machine.\n\n17\n00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.820\nWe talked about pop ups, browser\nredirections and should just really on\n\n18\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.750\nsome of the various security alerts that\nyou can see and you should be aware of.\n\n19\n00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.940\nKeep in mind, one of the last things that\nI mentioned was with security alerts\n\n20\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.450\nmake sure that you're alerted, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.400\nDon't disable security alerts.\n\n22\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.266\nSome people again, sometimes will find\nthem a little bit too intrusive I know\n\n23\n00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.417\nbefore I started getting into computers.\n\n24\n00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:07.832\nI would just disable these and\nnot realize that hey,\n\n25\n00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:11.180\nsomething was going on and\nyou're not aware of it.\n\n26\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.320\nAs I got into computers and\ngot into systems administration,\n\n27\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.200\nI started to notice that I really do\nwanna know when something's going on.\n\n28\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.210\nYou wanna be aware of signs that\nsomething isn't right on your computer,\n\n29\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.610\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n30\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.450\nSecurity alerts are there for\nyour benefit.\n\n31\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.740\nNow moving on, there are some other\nthings that we're gonna talk about too.\n\n32\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.660\nAnd one of the big things that can happen\na lot of times is slow performance.\n\n33\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.590\nNow slow performance, you got to\nbe careful with that one all right\n\n34\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.000\nbecause sometimes slow\nperformance security issue and\n\n35\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.010\nit's really nothing more\nthan bad browsing habits.\n\n36\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.460\nA slow hard drive.\n\n37\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.190\nIt could have nothing to do with malware.\n\n38\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.080\nNow, one of the easiest things to do is\nrun a malware scan on your computer right\n\n39\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.040\naway if you want to try to figure\nout whether it's malware or not.\n\n40\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.846\nBut again, sometimes malware can manifest\nitself in the form of slow performance.\n\n41\n00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:06.170\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n42\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.325\nSome of the things that can happen.\n\n43\n00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:11.620\nActually, sometimes you can see\nthings like memory leaks that happen.\n\n44\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.900\nAnd we've been using this\n\n45\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.016\nsoftware here that I'm gonna run\nreally through out this series here.\n\n46\n00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:20.030\nThis one, it's called Not My Fault.\n\n47\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.140\nLet me go ahead and\nopen up Not My Fault here.\n\n48\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.100\nCouple of things that can happen.\n\n49\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.040\nWe've already shown you guys in\nthe past things like up PC and\n\n50\n00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.290\nOS lockups if you will.\n\n51\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.150\nPC lockups, operating system lockups\nright where the system hangs.\n\n52\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.720\nAnd that can happen right, so one of the\nthings that you might notice is that hey,\n\n53\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.040\nyou're using your programs,\nyou're using your computer.\n\n54\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.740\nAnd then all of a sudden,\n\n55\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.250\nwell you decide that you want to\ndo something with your computer.\n\n56\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.320\nAnd when you do well unfortunately,\n\n57\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.880\nwhat ends up happening is you can't\nreally use the computer at all.\n\n58\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.980\nYou'll notice here something's going on.\n\n59\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.480\nI can't and notice it's locking up right?\n\n60\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.220\nIt's not responding.\n\n61\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.620\nI'm having some kind of issue here right?\n\n62\n00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.170\nThat could be a tell tale sign that you\nhave malware, could be a problem with\n\n63\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.740\nthe computer, could just be find that you\nneed to reboot the application, right?\n\n64\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.490\nBut notice that I am having\nsome kinda issue here and\n\n65\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.450\nit's causing a problem on my computer.\n\n66\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.564\nNow, let's see if we can force close this.\n\n67\n00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:25.704\nOne of the things that you can do is,\n\n68\n00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:30.638\nyou can try to wait until\nthe software itself responds.\n\n69\n00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:34.030\nIn this case, it's telling me hey,\nwe've got issue here, so\n\n70\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.410\nyou just have to close the program right?\n\n71\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.080\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.280\nCancel out of this because it's\ntrying to figure out what's going on.\n\n73\n00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.200\nNow I caused that problem myself please\nunderstand that but that doesn't\n\n74\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.480\nnecessarily mean that it's always gonna\nmanifest itself in that manner, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.700\nYou might get things like here\nwhere programs won't load, right?\n\n76\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.130\nThat could be problems as well, all right?\n\n77\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.950\nSo do keep that in mind here.\n\n78\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.510\nThis might be something here and\nI'm gonna try to load the other one and\n\n79\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.470\nit's probably not gonna load.\n\n80\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.870\nAnd I do believe I know why.\n\n81\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.340\nLet me go ahead real quick and\nwe'll bring up our Task Manager.\n\n82\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.830\nAnd another thing too about malware and\nslow performance right?\n\n83\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.740\nI can see that I have 100%\nCPU utilization right here.\n\n84\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.120\nSomething's causing\na problem in this machine.\n\n85\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.061\nAnd I can kinda sort these according to\nwhatever the process is that might be\n\n86\n00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:30.069\ncausing the problem here or\nI could go to the Details option.\n\n87\n00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.311\nAnd I can look through here and say hey,\ndo I find something in the background\n\n88\n00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.000\nthat's running that might\nbe causing the problem?\n\n89\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.470\nWell even though notice\nthis software is closed?\n\n90\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.000\nDo you notice that we closed it down?\n\n91\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.170\nBut I want you to see something here,\n\n92\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.700\nthe executable is still\nrunning in the background.\n\n93\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.820\nAll right, that's another\nthing that could might happen.\n\n94\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.262\nYou start getting slow performance\nbecause you've got an application or bug,\n\n95\n00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:54.356\nmalware that's running in the background\nand you're not aware of it.\n\n96\n00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.655\nEven though the application\nwas closed down.\n\n97\n00:04:56.655 --> 00:05:01.555\nSo what we can do is, we can end\nup the whole entire process tree.\n\n98\n00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:04.245\nHopefully, this doesn't access is denied.\n\n99\n00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:05.505\nSo it's not gonna let me do that.\n\n100\n00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.075\nThat's interesting.\n\n101\n00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:09.015\nWe try to end the task.\n\n102\n00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:11.675\nI think it's gonna fail again on me.\n\n103\n00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:15.294\nAll right, so\none of the things that you can do and\n\n104\n00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.866\nthis is a legendary fix all [LAUGH].\n\n105\n00:05:17.866 --> 00:05:19.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes for\n\n106\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.462\nyour computers are reboots, right.\n\n107\n00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:21.720\n&gt;&gt; That's what they say.\n\n108\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.050\n&gt;&gt; But I wanna go ahead and mention\nsomething now as we go into reboots,\n\n109\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.840\nthat you might have to go in to as well,\nto potentially fix problems that you might\n\n110\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.479\nhave when you get bugs and\nthat is the pre installation environment.\n\n111\n00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.210\nPre installation environments,\nremember that the operating system\n\n112\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.660\nisn't being loaded into the machine\nif you will or into RAM.\n\n113\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.300\nIn fact, what's happening here quite the\nopposite is when you have something like\n\n114\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.991\na pre installation environment\nthe hard drive really is,\n\n115\n00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.720\nit isn't really active, honestly.\n\n116\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.711\nWhat ends up happening is that you're\nloading a memory resonant operating\n\n117\n00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.985\nsystem in the RAM.\n\n118\n00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:01.937\nAnd it can give you access to the hard\ndrive so that you can try to fix\n\n119\n00:06:01.937 --> 00:06:05.280\nwhatever problem might be happening\nif it happens to be a security issue.\n\n120\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.880\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n121\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.380\nI'm gonna try to restart this machine.\n\n122\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.807\nAll right, so let's see if we can go\nahead and we can get this restarted.\n\n123\n00:06:11.807 --> 00:06:12.910\nIt might just take a second.\n\n124\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.250\nAnd I'm gonna try to boot into the BIOS,\nessentially the one time boot menu.\n\n125\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.910\nAnd I'm gonna point it to the ISO and\nwe're gonna load up that memory resonant\n\n126\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.880\noperating system, essentially\na pre installation environment.\n\n127\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.370\nAnd we're gonna use\nWindows Defender Offline.\n\n128\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.089\nRemember, Windows Defender Online means\nessentially what I'm gonna be doing is,\n\n129\n00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.015\nI'm going to be running Windows from\ninside of the operating system.\n\n130\n00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:38.110\nAnd what's gonna end up, looks like I\nmissed it there, let me try this again.\n\n131\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.470\nYou've gotta be really, really quick here.\n\n132\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.452\nWhat's gonna essentially happen is\nwe're gonna be running Windows from\n\n133\n00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:47.790\na pre installation environment.\n\n134\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.419\nIt might take me a couple\nof times to get this.\n\n135\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.250\nAnd it's doing its automatic repair.\n\n136\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.300\nWe try it one more time,\none more time, I can't catch it, nope.\n\n137\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.620\nAll right, didn't get at the first time.\n\n138\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.140\nLet's go ahead,\nwe'll try it one more time.\n\n139\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.200\nAnd again, as we reboot this what you're\ngonna end up saying is that it should,\n\n140\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.230\njust like an installation disk.\n\n141\n00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.480\nIt should prompt me to find the any key.\n\n142\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.580\nNow, Zach, I'm not exactly sure what\nthe any key is on the keyboard but\n\n143\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.970\nhopefully we'll find it here.\n\n144\n00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.140\nAnd again,\nyou can see it just takes a second.\n\n145\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.963\nBut just to understand what is going\non here, this is no different than\n\n146\n00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:26.050\nputting an optical disc if you will\ninto the drive or boot your USB device.\n\n147\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.290\nBut what's happening here is this is\nyour pre installation environment.\n\n148\n00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.740\nMuch the same way\nthe Windows Recovery environment is.\n\n149\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.020\nThe different here is, this is a specific\nversion of Windows Defender and\n\n150\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.990\nit's called offline.\n\n151\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.050\nWindows Defender Offline.\n\n152\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.259\nThe acronym as that one in [INAUDIBLE]\nyou need another one of those is WDO,\n\n153\n00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:44.921\nWindows Defender Offline.\n\n154\n00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:47.251\nIt's a free download out\nthere from Microsoft.\n\n155\n00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:53.660\nAnd then it's got a little executable and\nyou can create your own offline disk here.\n\n156\n00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.771\nWhat you can do is, you can put it\ninto a machine so if your machine.\n\n157\n00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:59.668\nYou start getting slow performance,\nyour machine won't boot up.\n\n158\n00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:04.428\nThen what you can do is,\nyou can essentially load this into RAM,\n\n159\n00:08:04.428 --> 00:08:06.290\nthis operating system.\n\n160\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.460\nYour hard drive isn't initiated, and\n\n161\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:14.080\nI point it essentially to the hard\ndrive that I want to run it against.\n\n162\n00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.540\nAnd you can see right here it's telling\nme that there is update definitions.\n\n163\n00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.780\nYou always have to\nupdate definitions here.\n\n164\n00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.119\nSo, I don't want you to think that there's\nsomething wrong if you use this at home,\n\n165\n00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:27.050\nor if you guys use this yourself and\nyou're like wait a second here, Wes.\n\n166\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.080\nWhy'd you tell us something\nthat's out of date.\n\n167\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.220\nWell, all definitions usually\ngo out of date within a week.\n\n168\n00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.860\nThat's why we constantly have patches and\nupdates.\n\n169\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.480\nDefinitions are updated regularly.\n\n170\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.400\nSo regardless of the time\nthat you download this,\n\n171\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.950\nyou're gonna have to\nhit Update definitions.\n\n172\n00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.960\nNow sometimes I've had this\nto have a problem where\n\n173\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.630\nit will download a certain portion of\nthem, but it won't install everyone.\n\n174\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.880\nDon't let that concern you.\n\n175\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.180\nJust go ahead,\nyou can see it's downloading here.\n\n176\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.430\nIt will download a portion of them but\nsometimes it download all of them.\n\n177\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.050\nWe should get a warning\nhere that says hey,\n\n178\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.850\nI couldn't install all of the updates or\nthe definition updates.\n\n179\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.310\nThat's fine, at least it gives\nyou something to start with and\n\n180\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.640\nyou can use this as well.\n\n181\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.630\nI'll show you another utility that we can\ndo too, if you start getting things like\n\n182\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.900\nslow performance inside\nof your operating system.\n\n183\n00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.960\nNotice that it says it couldn't\ncheck virus definitions and\n\n184\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.320\nagain, I expect that to happen.\n\n185\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.320\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchoose OK to this, and\n\n186\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.750\nnow notice that this is essentially\nyour Windows Defender interface, right?\n\n187\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.720\nAnd what I can do is I go to Home and\nI can do a custom scan, and I can say hey,\n\n188\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.510\nI wanna scan a certain location.\n\n189\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.880\nPay attention to the location\nthat you are going to search.\n\n190\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.820\nYou can see that we have a couple\nof different drive letters here.\n\n191\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.673\nBe careful with the drive letters.\n\n192\n00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:50.651\nAnd the reason I say that here let me\nzoom in a little bit better there.\n\n193\n00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:54.227\nIs because the drive letters don't\nnecessarily match up to the drive letters\n\n194\n00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:57.100\nthat you typically see with\ninside of your operating system.\n\n195\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.195\nRemember that it's local disk\n(C:) by default in Windows.\n\n196\n00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:05.175\nWell, it's actually here in our\npre installation environment,\n\n197\n00:10:05.175 --> 00:10:07.225\nit's actually Local Disk (E:).\n\n198\n00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:10.865\nAll right, so just pay attention, and one\nof the things I like to do is to expand\n\n199\n00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:14.465\nthese out to figure out, well,\nwhich drive is it, right?\n\n200\n00:10:14.465 --> 00:10:16.555\nIn this case I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n201\n00:10:16.555 --> 00:10:20.979\nI'm going to just kinda pay\nattention to the data drive here.\n\n202\n00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.068\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll scan that here.\n\n203\n00:10:24.068 --> 00:10:26.320\nAlright so I go ahead and\nchoose OK to that.\n\n204\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.100\nWe'll let it scan.\n\n205\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.700\nIt shouldn't take too long on this one,\nbut it's kind of customizing a scan.\n\n206\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.740\nAnd notice what it said.\n\n207\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.410\nScan completed,\nnotice this said scan 6 items.\n\n208\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.370\nNotice what its telling me right here.\n\n209\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.590\nThis app detected a potential\nthread on the PC.\n\n210\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.370\nRight, well I going to want\nto get some details here.\n\n211\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.050\nThere's that darn pesky EICAR virus\nstrain that I was telling you about.\n\n212\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.370\nAnd again, remember it's not actually\na virus, but it is telling me that there\n\n213\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.220\nare potential threats here, and\nI wanna take care of them, right?\n\n214\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.830\nSo that's a good thing about\na pre-installation environment is the fact\n\n215\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.600\nthat the hard drive isn't active.\n\n216\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.993\nI'm not running the hard drive at all.\n\n217\n00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.885\nRight but what I'm doing is I'm\nrunning this Operating System which is\n\n218\n00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:04.051\nWindows Defender Offline.\n\n219\n00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:08.240\nWhich is a very small footprint Win PE\ndisk essentially with Windows Defender\n\n220\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.428\nslip-streamed into it that I can I could\npoint it right to the locations that I\n\n221\n00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:15.149\nwanna scan and\nI can run those scans and this case.\n\n222\n00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:16.671\n&gt;&gt; Very efficient safeguard.\n\n223\n00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:19.201\n&gt;&gt; Very very, it's great to have,\ndoesn't cost anything.\n\n224\n00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.223\nAnd that goes back to your question that\nyou asked in the first part of this, Zach.\n\n225\n00:11:23.223 --> 00:11:26.877\nAnd again, great question is the fact\nthat, hey, do I need to pay for\n\n226\n00:11:26.877 --> 00:11:31.235\nsomething or what Windows gives me, or\nMicrosoft gives me, is that good enough?\n\n227\n00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:33.655\nWell, if you don't have money,\nthis is great to have.\n\n228\n00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:36.205\nIt's a great alternative,\nit's a great option to have, but\n\n229\n00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:37.800\nif you do have money as well.\n\n230\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.940\nPlenty of manufacturers out there\nthat develop very good software,\n\n231\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.450\nincluding Microsoft, again.\n\n232\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.610\nI don't want to overlook that.\n\n233\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.820\nWe apply the actions, all right, and\n\n234\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.959\nyou can see that it says\ntaking a few seconds here.\n\n235\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.790\nAnd it's gonna run through the drive, and\n\n236\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.330\nit says hey there, everything's good,\nwe're green lighted, we're ready to go.\n\n237\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.830\nAll right, so in that aspect, what I\ncould do is I could just turn around and\n\n238\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:11.140\nI could get out of, essentially\nthe the pre-installation environment.\n\n239\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.890\nNow the other thing that you could do,\ntoo,\n\n240\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.140\nis you could also do this from command\nprompt, you could do it from the terminal.\n\n241\n00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.100\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust restart this machine here.\n\n242\n00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.870\nAnd I won't press the any key here.\n\n243\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.712\nI'll keep my hands off of the desk here.\n\n244\n00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:26.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll let it go ahead and boot back\n\n245\n00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:31.470\ninto Windows And we can talk about some of\nthe other things that we need it to do.\n\n246\n00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.408\nThat's great in a sense that you know,\n\n247\n00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:36.305\nif you do have applications\nthat start to cause problems.\n\n248\n00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:40.906\nYou've seen how one application,\nthat problematic application\n\n249\n00:12:40.906 --> 00:12:45.189\nI kinda self inflicted pain here,\nor a self inflicted wound.\n\n250\n00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:49.740\nI may, Not My Fault, lock the machine up.\n\n251\n00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.920\nI made it to where I couldn't\ninteract with it anymore.\n\n252\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.890\nBut those are some of the common\nsymptoms that you will see when malware\n\n253\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.580\ngets on your devices.\n\n254\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.370\nAnd I can't shut the executable down.\n\n255\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.710\nI've had them so bad, and\nI'll go ahead and get logged in here.\n\n256\n00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.170\nI've had them so bad before on machines\nwhere what would end up happening\n\n257\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.915\nwas you couldn't even do something\nlike drop down to the taskbar here,\n\n258\n00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:15.450\nright-click and\nchoose Task Manager, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.220\nBecause believe it or not, Task Manager,\nif I go over to the Details tab and,\n\n260\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.920\nlet's see.\n\n261\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.110\nCan I see?\n\n262\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.060\nGonna scroll down here.\n\n263\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.180\nOkay, so Taskmgr is an executable, right?\n\n264\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.540\nAnd let me show you something else too.\n\n265\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:34.086\nIf I run Computer Management, all right,\nand we'll go ahead just minimize that,\n\n266\n00:13:34.086 --> 00:13:37.666\ncuz I really just wanna kinda\nshow you guys this here.\n\n267\n00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:42.251\nI believe we'll see Computer Management\nas an executable in the list too.\n\n268\n00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:45.517\nI could be wrong there,\nit might be running from an MMC.\n\n269\n00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:49.798\nBut again, these are valid executables,\nand what happens sometimes is malware,\n\n270\n00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:53.468\nsome of the security issues that you\nrun into, is that malware gets onto\n\n271\n00:13:53.468 --> 00:13:57.650\nyour computer and it doesn't allow you\nto run these administrative utilities.\n\n272\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.150\nThey're smart enough to know that it says,\nhey, don't let these run.\n\n273\n00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.196\nAnd in that case, what's going to end up\nhappening is that you're going to have to\n\n274\n00:14:04.196 --> 00:14:08.420\nrun a pre-installation environment.\n\n275\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.810\nYou're going to have to run Malware Bytes.\n\n276\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.610\nMalware Bytes is a great one because,\nagain,\n\n277\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.730\nyou can boot to it,\nyou can boot to a rescue disk.\n\n278\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.720\nIt's essentially just,\nseems like it's a small Linux Live CD and\n\n279\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.050\nyou can repair your computer when\nthe operating system isn't loaded.\n\n280\n00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:31.090\nAll right, so Zach, those are couple of\nthe things that we need to worry about.\n\n281\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.250\nLet me see if I can get not my focus.\n\n282\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.250\nNot My Fault is running good,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n283\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.690\nlet's dive back into the desktop here.\n\n284\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.570\nI wanna show you some other\nthings that you might see.\n\n285\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.640\nAnd again, remember,\n\n286\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.990\nI'm using this application to\nsimulate the symptoms that you see.\n\n287\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.250\nUnderstand that these still, even those\napplications is causing the problem,\n\n288\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.390\nmalware manifests itself this way,\nas well.\n\n289\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.260\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\ncause a memory leak, all right?\n\n290\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.490\nAnd memory leaks\nare interesting in the fact that\n\n291\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.180\nthey can happen because of bad coding.\n\n292\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.340\nThey can also happen because of malware\nand they can cause system hangups.\n\n293\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.310\nThey can cause PC lockups, right?\n\n294\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.970\nThey can cause applications to crash.\n\n295\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.580\nNow you've already seen\nthe application crash.\n\n296\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.090\nWe demonstrated that with Not My Fault.\n\n297\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.760\nWe could move and close it down, but\n\n298\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.020\nlet me show you where you could\nfind memory leaks, right?\n\n299\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.410\nWhen I click on my task bar,\nchoose Task Manager.\n\n300\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.080\nAll right, and\nI go to the Performance tab.\n\n301\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.690\nI want you to pay attention to something.\n\n302\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.290\nNotice the memory is at 1.1 gigs.\n\n303\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.180\nThat's half of the memory that I've\nallocated to this virtual machine.\n\n304\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.930\nBut more so, I want you to\nwatch this number, all right?\n\n305\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.450\nNotice what's happening to that number.\n\n306\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.730\nThat's the available memory that\nI have in the machine, all right?\n\n307\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.210\nSee what's happening?\n\n308\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.420\nIt's consuming more, and\nmore, and more memory.\n\n309\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.350\nAnd it keeps happening.\n\n310\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.950\nAnd we're getting less and less memory.\n\n311\n00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.150\nNow what can start to happen here is\nyou can have, your PC's gonna lock up.\n\n312\n00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.870\nNow your PC could lock,\nit could do a couple of things, right?\n\n313\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.233\nIt could lock up to where\nyou can't do anything,\n\n314\n00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:02.648\nit can actually shut the whole entire\ngraphical user interface down.\n\n315\n00:16:02.648 --> 00:16:06.760\nCuz the graphical user interface is,\nIs controlled by something known as DWM.\n\n316\n00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.870\nLet me see if I can get to it\nbefore the application actually.\n\n317\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.580\nCuz the application is going\nto crash here shortly.\n\n318\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.545\nActually, let me go to details here,\nand I do believe in here, yeah,\n\n319\n00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:24.020\nDWM right there, that is your\nWindows Desktop Manager right?\n\n320\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.950\nThat's responsible, and\nnotice that it needs and it's using and\n\n321\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.750\nconsuming around 17,000\nKilobytes of memory.\n\n322\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.210\nWell, at a certain point,\nwhen you have malware or a problematic\n\n323\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.950\napp that starts causing you problems and\nconsuming your memory like this is.\n\n324\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:39.770\nThis is a memory leak.\n\n325\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.320\nNotice I'm losing memory right here.\n\n326\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.000\nNotice it keeps dwindling,\nand it keeps dwindling.\n\n327\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.690\nNow, we're gonna see\nwhat's gonna happen here.\n\n328\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.180\nAnd I'll keep my fingers crossed,\n\n329\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.090\nI don't know if we're gonna\nget a blue screen, right?\n\n330\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.650\nThe BSOD,\n\n331\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:57.210\nI don't know if what we're gonna do is\nsee an entire graphical user interface.\n\n332\n00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.390\nJust cease to function, all right?\n\n333\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.540\nMalware does this,\nworms do this a lot, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.730\nRemember what a worm does, right?\n\n335\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.350\nIt replicates itself across multiple\nlocations and it consumes your memory.\n\n336\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.890\nYour CPU utilization,\nyour RAM utilization you're disk IO,\n\n337\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.310\nyou can see some internet\nactivity going in the background.\n\n338\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.050\nThat'll start to sky rocket,\nstart to spike.\n\n339\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.230\nWe're getting close,\nand what we should see.\n\n340\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.240\nNow understand,\nI don't have a screen saver on this.\n\n341\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.390\nSo you might see that this\nscreen is gonna disappear.\n\n342\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.830\nWatch what happens,\nwe're getting really, really close.\n\n343\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.520\nAnd Windows is really trying right now,\n\n344\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.720\nreally trying right now to save itself,\nright?\n\n345\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.560\nIt's taking and it's paging memory.\n\n346\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.570\nIt's taking memory and it's putting\nmemory that's used by applications.\n\n347\n00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.712\nIt's writing it to the hard drive,\nguess what?\n\n348\n00:17:39.712 --> 00:17:43.720\nIt doesn't matter, in this case, this\napplication is still consuming memory.\n\n349\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.160\nWe're getting down and\nwe're getting close.\n\n350\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.130\nAll right, remember what we needed\nto run the Windows Desktop,\n\n351\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.360\nthe graphical user interface,\nwe need 17,000K.\n\n352\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.530\nWell, we're at about 200,000K right now.\n\n353\n00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.640\nAll right, so\nwe still got a little bit of memory left.\n\n354\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.790\nBut what happens when our memory\nutilization gets to be around 99%.\n\n355\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.600\nRight, we're at 90%, we're at 95%.\n\n356\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.050\nAnd if you guys and gals out there will\njust bear with me talking a little bit\n\n357\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.810\nabout some of these things,\nwell we'll see what's gonna go on here.\n\n358\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.400\nSo again, this can happen too.\n\n359\n00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.850\nSpam is another thing that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n360\n00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:21.570\nRemember spam is just unsolicited emails,\ndon't open, if we could take a look,\n\n361\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.630\nI really need to see this desktop or\nwe're gonna miss it.\n\n362\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.480\nKeep in mind, spam is a bad thing.\n\n363\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.150\nThat is unsolicited emails,\nyou never download or\n\n364\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.400\nopen emails that come\nfrom unknown sources.\n\n365\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.800\nDon't download attachments, right?\n\n366\n00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.960\nOkay, we're getting close here.\n\n367\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.440\nLook at, we're down to about 44K,\nand it's getting close.\n\n368\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.710\nWhat we should see here real soon,\nif everything happens the way I think\n\n369\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.060\nit's gonna happen,\nwe're at 100% memory utilization.\n\n370\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.920\nOop, and notice we're getting,\nnotice what's happening.\n\n371\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.520\nThe desktop manager's saying wait\na second I don't have any more memory,\n\n372\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.900\nI can't run right?\n\n373\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.210\nI've got a complete system lock out.\n\n374\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.360\nI can't get into the computer here.\n\n375\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.875\n&gt;&gt; Even though I know you've done this,\nit's scaring me.\n\n376\n00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:10.198\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes,\n\n377\n00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:13.625\nthis is the time when you\nput on your tin foil hat.\n\n378\n00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.730\nWe use good security practices, right?\n\n379\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.380\nAgain, things like spam, all right,\nand thank you out there.\n\n380\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.560\nI just wanted to make sure that\nwe got to see that real quick.\n\n381\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.340\nYou can see that I really can't\nsee anything anymore, right?\n\n382\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.212\nAgain, remember when the memory\nutilization gets consumed like this,\n\n383\n00:19:28.212 --> 00:19:30.755\na lot of times, like I said,\nworms can do this.\n\n384\n00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:32.645\nAnd they can just cause\nall kinds of problems.\n\n385\n00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:36.486\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead, and what i'll do\nhere in the background while we continue\n\n386\n00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:38.825\non is,\nI'm actually gonna restart this machine.\n\n387\n00:19:38.825 --> 00:19:40.904\nSo I don't have to worry about\nnot my fault sitting here and\n\n388\n00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:42.445\nconsuming additional memory.\n\n389\n00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:46.465\nSometimes I have seen where it\nactually causes a blue screen,\n\n390\n00:19:46.465 --> 00:19:49.870\nagain because your operating system\nneeds a certain amount of memory.\n\n391\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:54.350\nGosh, I think the bare minimum is\nlike 512 megs of memory to run.\n\n392\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.435\nNow, that being said did\nyou see how well it did?\n\n393\n00:19:57.435 --> 00:19:59.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The operating system continued to run\n\n394\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.870\nin even less than 512 megs of ram, but\nwhat you get is the painful experience.\n\n395\n00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.290\nYou don't get the crisp sharp image.\n\n396\n00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.580\nSo yeah, our machine seems to be back\nonline here, which is a great thing too.\n\n397\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.210\nNow I will tell you another\nthing that can happen as well.\n\n398\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.220\nUpdate failures, update failures\ncan happen for a couple of reasons.\n\n399\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.350\nYou might have an internet\nconnection problem right?\n\n400\n00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.770\nBecause, again,\ninternet connectivity issues cause issues.\n\n401\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.270\nAnd that might cause the fact that\nyou can't communicate out there with\n\n402\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.560\nWindows Update.\n\n403\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.980\nUnderstand that Windows Update is also,\nruns off of a service.\n\n404\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.430\nAnd as we said before, services,\nif they're disabled by malware,\n\n405\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.860\ncan cause problems as well.\n\n406\n00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.900\nIt could be user error as well.\n\n407\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.490\nAgain, it could be an Internet\nconnectivity issue.\n\n408\n00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.780\nI have seen it where a malware has\ncaused problems with system drivers.\n\n409\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.999\nAnd some of those system drivers,\n\n410\n00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:54.290\nhaving been directly related to the\nnetwork adaptor, again causing issues too.\n\n411\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.530\nSome of the other things that you\ncould see are files disappearing.\n\n412\n00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.534\nFiles disappearing is tell tale sign that\nyou've got certain things that are being\n\n413\n00:21:01.534 --> 00:21:02.280\nerased.\n\n414\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.310\nIf you will, if you see files being,\n\n415\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.910\nsystem files being renamed,\nthat can happen as well.\n\n416\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.160\nRenamed system files is tell tale of some\nkind of malware that's on your system.\n\n417\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.725\nLikewise, permission changes,\nwhen ACLs start to change,\n\n418\n00:21:15.725 --> 00:21:20.330\nyour access control list, the permissions\ninside of Windows start to change.\n\n419\n00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.660\nThese are also things that could\ncause you issues, likewise.\n\n420\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.600\nAccess denied issues, these are some other\nthings that you need to worry about.\n\n421\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:34.350\nWhen you start to get access denied, that\ncould be the Windows protecting itself.\n\n422\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.510\nBut it could be a virus trying\nto protect itself as well.\n\n423\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.967\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you mentioned this, and\nmaybe my brain was somewhere else but\n\n424\n00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.160\nrogue antivirus or rogue viruses rather?\n\n425\n00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah these are nasty little\n[LAUGH] pieces of malware.\n\n426\n00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Rogue antivirus,\n\n427\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.280\nscareware sometimes as I call it as well.\n\n428\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.580\nRogue antivirus is one that makes it look\nlike it is an antivirus solution where\n\n429\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.040\nall of a sudden it starts\nrunning on your system.\n\n430\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.660\nAnd it tells you,\nyou have 100 gazillion viruses, and\n\n431\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.010\nthey would love to get them off your\nsystem provided you pay them money.\n\n432\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.385\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that many times.\n\n433\n00:22:05.385 --> 00:22:09.244\n&gt;&gt; That's rogue antivirus, the other thing\nthat the rogue antiviruses will do is\n\n434\n00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:11.962\nbrowser redirections,\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n435\n00:22:11.962 --> 00:22:14.300\nAnd when they get on your system\nthey act like they're running\n\n436\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.488\n&gt;&gt; They lock out all the other\n\n437\n00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:18.900\nexecutables, and the only they're\nallowed to run is Internet Explorer.\n\n438\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.130\nAnd it points to their malicious website,\nso\n\n439\n00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.720\nthat you'll buy whatever\ntheir software is.\n\n440\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.525\nAnd rogue antiviruses\ncan also be a problem.\n\n441\n00:22:26.525 --> 00:22:30.671\nThey also call out things like,\nfor instance, hacked or excuse me,\n\n442\n00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:31.748\nhijacked email.\n\n443\n00:22:31.748 --> 00:22:37.043\nTalking about responses from users\nregarding email, again, keep in mind\n\n444\n00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:42.855\nthe best thing that you can do is don't\nreply to emails that you don't recognize.\n\n445\n00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:47.111\nIf it didn't come from your company,\nif it isn't something that you recognize.\n\n446\n00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:50.230\nYou know the source,\nyou trust the source, don't open it.\n\n447\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.120\nYou might see that they talk about\nautomated replies from unknown sent email.\n\n448\n00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.730\nAgain, that's just another form of spam,\n\n449\n00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.830\nhijacked emails can be where somebody\nhas done a fishing scam to you.\n\n450\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.634\nThey got your account information, and\nwhen they got your account information\n\n451\n00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:08.510\nthey're now using it to access your email\nand send out additional forms of spam.\n\n452\n00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.010\nSo you do have to be careful with that,\ntoo.\n\n453\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.255\nNow some of the tools that we've talked\nabout, we kind of already mentioned in\n\n454\n00:23:15.255 --> 00:23:17.780\npast episodes, but\nI kinda want to go through the list here.\n\n455\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.599\nSystem restore is a great way,\nthat, if you get a piece\n\n456\n00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:24.767\nof malware on your system and it installs\nan application, a rogue application,\n\n457\n00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:28.100\nremember you can restore your\nsystem to a earlier point in time.\n\n458\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Point in time.\n\n459\n00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.760\n&gt;&gt; With something known\nas a restore point.\n\n460\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.310\nNow they're also called snapshots,\nthose were,\n\n461\n00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.230\nit does need, you do need to make sure\nthat ensure that it is turned on.\n\n462\n00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.016\nWe've shown you in other episodes\nhow to run System Restore and\n\n463\n00:23:42.016 --> 00:23:43.740\nwhere to keep that running.\n\n464\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.436\nIn fact, we'll go ahead, just as\na real quick recap while we're here,\n\n465\n00:23:46.436 --> 00:23:47.110\nwe might as well.\n\n466\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.891\nAll right, if I right-click on our\nWindows desktop here, the Windows tile,\n\n467\n00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:53.930\nand I choose System, all right.\n\n468\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.660\nAnd I go to System protection\nover here in this hyperlink.\n\n469\n00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.560\nKeep in mind that we\nhave System Protection.\n\n470\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.350\nAnd is it turned on or is not turned on?\n\n471\n00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.050\nNow, I've got an extra data drive in here,\nand I don't have it turned on.\n\n472\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:09.897\nBut if I want system restore to protect\nthis as well, then I've actually\n\n473\n00:24:09.897 --> 00:24:14.910\ngot to configure it, and I've gotta\ntell it to turn on System Protection.\n\n474\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.174\nAnd that's up to me as to whether or\nI wanna turn it on,\n\n475\n00:24:18.174 --> 00:24:20.581\nnow I can see that it's on both drives.\n\n476\n00:24:20.581 --> 00:24:25.361\nYou do need to make sure that\nyou have System Restore points.\n\n477\n00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:29.650\nRemember, you can create these manually\njust by choosing create a restore point.\n\n478\n00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.690\nI can do that right here,\nwe can call this, I don't know,\n\n479\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.585\ncuz I'm so creative 220902A+.\n\n480\n00:24:36.585 --> 00:24:39.875\nIt's a demo, all right,\nand that's a great thing.\n\n481\n00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.895\nI can go ahead and create that.\n\n482\n00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:46.275\nNow, like I've said in past episodes,\nwith System Restore.\n\n483\n00:24:46.275 --> 00:24:48.501\nHonestly I can't remember\nif I've said this, so\n\n484\n00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.833\nI'll say it here just to\nmake sure that we complete.\n\n485\n00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:55.560\nNotice the restore point was\nsuccessfully created, was it?\n\n486\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.340\nI don't know, I never trust\nthe dialogue box, I always make sure.\n\n487\n00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.940\nSo one of the ways that you\ncan always make sure that your\n\n488\n00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.670\nrestore points have been created\nis start to do a System Restore.\n\n489\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:09.530\nNow I have no intentions on doing\na System Restore right now, but\n\n490\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.880\nI could chose Next and\nnotice that it is created right?\n\n491\n00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.500\nAnd that is an important, right?\n\n492\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.250\nI always make sure that if\nI create a restore point,\n\n493\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.335\nI start a restore process just to\nknow that it has been created.\n\n494\n00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:26.870\nRemember, we talked about taking\nbackups of your operating system.\n\n495\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.776\nYou don't wanna wait til you need your\nbackups to verify that the back up was\n\n496\n00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:31.530\nsuccessful.\n\n497\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.480\nAll right,\nthat's a very good thing to have in play.\n\n498\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.360\n&gt;&gt; All right Jack, well it looks like\nwe've got a bunch more of talking about.\n\n499\n00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.193\nBut again, looks like we might have to\ngo on a part three on this one as well.\n\n500\n00:25:43.193 --> 00:25:46.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Troubleshoot PC Security\nSystems, they'll be a part 3.\n\n501\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.130\nThere was a part 2, right now,\nyou just watched that.\n\n502\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.990\nAnd there was a part,\nmake sure you watch them all.\n\n503\n00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:56.470\nIn fact, watch everything in the CompTIA\nA+ 902 series, you'll be so glad you did.\n\n504\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.489\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n505\n00:25:58.489 -->

00:00:11.354\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:13.851\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:15.832\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:21.073\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Comptia A+ 902.\n\n7\n00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:25.267\nThis is\nTroubleshoot PC Security Systems Part 3.\n\n8\n00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:28.370\nThere was a part 1,\nthere was a part 2, this is part 3.\n\n9\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.760\nMake sure you watch all of those,\nyou'll be very glad that you did.\n\n10\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.550\nAnd the person bringing us all the\ninformation we need is our own Wes Brian.\n\n11\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.135\nWes, good to see you again, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.256\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:40.540\nThat's right, we've got a few more\nthings we wanted to round off\n\n14\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.360\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting\nPC security issues that we really\n\n15\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.440\ndidn't get to tackle in\nthe first couple of parts.\n\n16\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.090\nSo you might notice that this\none might be a little bit more\n\n17\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.580\nbrief than the first couple ones.\n\n18\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.110\nAnd that means I've talked\na lot in the first two,\n\n19\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.190\nso you could probably use the break.\n\n20\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.170\nBut we are going to talk about\na couple of additional concepts.\n\n21\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.264\nOne of the things I didn't talk about\nIn the first couple of parts here,\n\n22\n00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:05.962\nthey call on the exams what's\nknown as an invalid certificate.\n\n23\n00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:09.186\nSo we do wanna talk a little\nbit about that, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:14.326\nan invalid certificate is something\nthat really can be seen fairly easy.\n\n25\n00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:19.226\nIt just depends, you have to be\nkinda looking out for it and\n\n26\n00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:21.840\nknow why, what might happen.\n\n27\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.190\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n28\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.825\nI'm actually on a website\nhere called badssl.\n\n29\n00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:31.620\nAnd badssl, what they have is this site is\na completely legitimate site by the way.\n\n30\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.740\nI can see that it is secure.\n\n31\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.540\nAnd if I look, it does let me know that\nthis information is a secure connection,\n\n32\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.332\nit says it's private when\nit's sent to this site.\n\n33\n00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:47.210\nSo badssl is a great website to test\nout what your web browsers might see\n\n34\n00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.240\nif they come across what's known as\nan invalid certificate, a trusted root CA.\n\n35\n00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.220\nWell, what's a trusted root CA?\n\n36\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.860\nA root CA is a root certificate authority,\nall right?\n\n37\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.104\nAnd out there, across the Internet,\nwe have what's known as a trust mile,\n\n38\n00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:02.874\na chain of trust.\n\n39\n00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:06.132\nAnd you have what are known of these\ncertificate of authorities, and\n\n40\n00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:09.030\nthese certificate of\nauthorities are companies.\n\n41\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.487\nWhat they do, is they put their seal\nof approval on different websites and\n\n42\n00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.461\nsoftware and really all kinds of things.\n\n43\n00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.022\nBut the big two here\nare websites that you go to,\n\n44\n00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:23.110\nas well as software that you download\nto your computer, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.553\nAnd if your operating system or\nyour web browser trust the browser or\n\n46\n00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:32.467\nthe certificate,\nI should say For the website or\n\n47\n00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:36.668\nthe software that your\ndownloading then you will get\n\n48\n00:02:36.668 --> 00:02:41.650\nsomething like we have right\nhere inside of our quorum here.\n\n49\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.138\nI see this secure,\nI see this little green lock.\n\n50\n00:02:43.138 --> 00:02:46.872\nIt lets me know that if I\nwanted to look up this company,\n\n51\n00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:52.000\nI could verify who they are and\nwe could verify that they're trustworthy.\n\n52\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.690\nSo this company, in this case,\nwhoever it is that owns this website here.\n\n53\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.050\nAnd I'm not exactly sure who it is.\n\n54\n00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.460\nAnd in fact, I'll tell you what,\nlet's kinda find out.\n\n55\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.830\nWe can find that information out and\n\n56\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.460\nshow you why you wanna trust certificates,\nright?\n\n57\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.960\nSo if I go down in here to More Tools, and\n\n58\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.560\nDeveloper Tools,\nI think that's what I want here, yes.\n\n59\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.474\nLet me go ahead and close this here.\n\n60\n00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:19.160\nAnd this is a valid certificate, right?\n\n61\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.177\nWell this is a trusted server certificate,\nso what this company did,\n\n62\n00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:26.459\nis they went to a certificate\nauthority known as Comodo.\n\n63\n00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.408\nAnd Comodo, they paid money and said,\nhey, we wanna have a website out there.\n\n64\n00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:34.937\nSo that if Zack and myself, and\nyou out there watching go to it,\n\n65\n00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:37.620\nyou know that your data is secure.\n\n66\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.838\nIn fact, we're gonna go through\nthis little security process,\n\n67\n00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:45.915\nwe're gonna make sure that\nthe data maintains its integrity.\n\n68\n00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:49.298\nAnd again, it can't be eavesdropped,\nsomebody can't go out there and\n\n69\n00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:50.472\ngrab your information.\n\n70\n00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:53.990\nAnd understand what's going on,\nor steal your information, right?\n\n71\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.100\nThrough a process called encryption.\n\n72\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.500\nAnd I can go here, and I can see\nwhere does this place exist, right?\n\n73\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.020\nWell I can see that\nthe organization here is Comodo.\n\n74\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.210\nI can see that they're in\nthe Greater Manchester area, if you will.\n\n75\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.720\nAnd I can see all the security\ninformation related.\n\n76\n00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.989\nAnd I can also see who this\ncertificate was issued to.\n\n77\n00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.599\nAll right,\nin this case it issued to this website.\n\n78\n00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:23.390\nNow there are times when you might have\na certificate that isn't trusted, right?\n\n79\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.730\nThey talk about an invalid certificate or\na trusted root certificate authority.\n\n80\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.090\nWell, where are we\ngetting that trust from?\n\n81\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.050\nI mean, what is actually happening?\n\n82\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.490\nWell, believe it or not, your web browser\ndoes something kinda interesting.\n\n83\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.690\nIt sees the certificate\nthat's being presented to it.\n\n84\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.652\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n85\n00:04:41.652 --> 00:04:44.343\nwe'll view the certificate and\nit looks at this certificate.\n\n86\n00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:50.590\nWhat's known as the certificate chain,\nand it says, hey, should I trust badssl?\n\n87\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.290\nWell I don't know,\nwho gave them their seal of approval,\n\n88\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.810\ntheir digital certificate, right, their\nlittle stamp that says you can trust me?\n\n89\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.330\nWell I can look up the chain here and\nI can see, it was comodo Comodo did this.\n\n90\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.710\nWell, why should I trust Comodo?\n\n91\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.030\nWell, Comodo is also\nwhat's known as a trusted\n\n92\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.420\nroot certification authority, all right?\n\n93\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.230\nTrusted roots are these external\ncompanies out there, and\n\n94\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.040\neven intermediate authorities,\nthese are the middlemen, if you will.\n\n95\n00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.857\nThe root authorities out there\nare the ones, the organizations that\n\n96\n00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:29.424\nsay you know what, if we put our\nseal of approval on your website,\n\n97\n00:05:29.424 --> 00:05:33.762\nwe guarantee that your information\nis gonna remain private.\n\n98\n00:05:33.762 --> 00:05:36.174\nIt's gonna be confidential and\nsomebody shouldn't be able to steal it.\n\n99\n00:05:36.174 --> 00:05:39.200\nAnd if it causes you damages, guess what?\n\n100\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.340\nWe insure that, right,\nwe're licensed, bonded, and insured.\n\n101\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.915\nRight, so this is why you always wanna\n\n102\n00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:50.842\ntrust a website that you go\nto when it has https in it.\n\n103\n00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:52.842\nRight you wanna make\nsure that it's encrypted.\n\n104\n00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:56.060\nYou wanna make sure it won't\ncompromise your system.\n\n105\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.940\nSometimes you can get errors like this,\n\n106\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.610\nwhere it says your\nconnection is not private.\n\n107\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.430\nAll right, notice it tells me here,\nit says, authority invalid.\n\n108\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.220\nSo, in this case, it's telling me\nI don't trust this certificate.\n\n109\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.850\nNow, keep in mind, badssl,\nthe owners of badssl,\n\n110\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.130\nthey're the ones that put this together.\n\n111\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.760\nThere's nothing wrong with this, and they\njust want to show you what would happen\n\n112\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.190\nif it's presented to your browser and\nyour browser doesn't trust it.\n\n113\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.460\nIt says, hey, you need to,\nin fact it tells you, right.\n\n114\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.285\nIt says, go back to safety.\n\n115\n00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:33.570\n[LAUGH] All right,\nbrowse away from this website, right.\n\n116\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.035\nNow you could go and do Advanced and\nyou could say, you know what,\n\n117\n00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:40.635\nI'm gonna go to this website anyways,\nthis untrusted route here.\n\n118\n00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:43.190\nAnd it tells you that it's unsafe,\nright, so\n\n119\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.690\nthat's a security issue\nthat could come up.\n\n120\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.020\nNow, how do we know whether\nwe trust certificates or not?\n\n121\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.820\nLet me show you inside of our\nWindows operating system.\n\n122\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.736\nAnd apparently,\nI forgot to boot the machine up, so\n\n123\n00:06:54.736 --> 00:06:56.540\nwe'll let the machine boot up.\n\n124\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.990\nWell, inside of Windows we have\nwhat's known as a certificate store.\n\n125\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.900\nAll right, a certificate store is a\nprotected location within Windows that we\n\n126\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.680\nhave, the root authorities, those\nexternal companies that we talked about.\n\n127\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.830\nIn fact, Microsoft has one in\nthere as well, Verisign has one.\n\n128\n00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.740\nI believe we'll even see things\nlike Comodo in there, too.\n\n129\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.950\nBut if I get logged into this machine,\nall right, again, you can launch\n\n130\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.030\nup what's known as a Microsoft Management\nConsole, or an MMC, as it's called.\n\n131\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.351\nAnd there's actually a certificate,\na snap-in,\n\n132\n00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:32.000\nthat'll allow you to see this information.\n\n133\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.430\nSo if I go to my modern view line and\ntype MMC, Mike Mike Charlie, here.\n\n134\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.060\nNotice I have this mmc.exe,\na couple different ways you can get to it.\n\n135\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.050\nThis is one of the ways I'll show you,\nand another way coming up.\n\n136\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.415\nNow, what this does is it launches\na blank Microsoft Management Console.\n\n137\n00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:50.300\nKinda like Computer Management, but\nwithout all the snap-ins, right?\n\n138\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:56.314\nAnd then what I can do here is,\nI can add Snap-ins to this list, right.\n\n139\n00:07:56.314 --> 00:07:58.840\nI can add the utilities that I want.\n\n140\n00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.247\nAnd for me The one that I\nwant just disappeared there,\n\n141\n00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:04.680\nthe Certificates, and I choose Add.\n\n142\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.827\nAnd it asks me, well,\nwhat do you want to add certificates to?\n\n143\n00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:11.383\nThe certificates can be issued to users,\nthey can be issued to services that run\n\n144\n00:08:11.383 --> 00:08:14.630\nyour machine, as well as, in this case,\ncomputer accounts, right?\n\n145\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.450\nI'm going to a web server out\nthere across the Internet.\n\n146\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.865\nThe web server, server certificate,\nit's computer, right?\n\n147\n00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:23.600\nSo how does my computer\ntrust that certificate?\n\n148\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.410\nWell, in the computer accounts portion,\nit has this certificate store, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.670\nSo I'm gonna say,\nthe Local Computer here, choose OK.\n\n150\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.866\nI don't know that they're gonna require\nyou to know all of this information.\n\n151\n00:08:35.866 --> 00:08:39.970\nBut it is important just to\nunderstand how was that trust model,\n\n152\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.560\nwhere is it established on my computer?\n\n153\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.900\nHow's that my computer is even\naware that those things exist?\n\n154\n00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.270\nYou didn't type them in, right?\n\n155\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.847\nYou didn't say,\ntrust Comodo in this case, right?\n\n156\n00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:52.710\nWell, that's because they're already\non your computer by default.\n\n157\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.460\nAnd if I open up my\ncertificates console here,\n\n158\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.540\nyou'll notice that there are Trusted\nRoot Certification Authorities, right?\n\n159\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.660\nAnd if I expand this out, you'll see\nthat there is a certificates container.\n\n160\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.560\nThis is the certificate's store,\nif you will.\n\n161\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.750\nWe store them here, I'm not saying,\nwe're gonna go shopping, but\n\n162\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.460\na certificate store.\n\n163\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.330\nAnd if you'll notice, there are some\nthat are already in here by default.\n\n164\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.740\nNow, let me go ahead and expand this out,\nmake it a little bit easier for us to see.\n\n165\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.950\nAll right, and these are the ones\nthat Windows is aware of, right?\n\n166\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.450\nAnd we could see things like VeriSign.\n\n167\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.820\nDoesn't look like Comodo's in here, but\n\n168\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.620\nComodo is a trusted root\ncertification authority as well.\n\n169\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.460\nBut notice, I have GlobalSign, and\nthis just means that if my computer\n\n170\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.480\nor browser, the computer I saved\nhere installing software, right?\n\n171\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.670\nRemember those digital security\nstamps that I was telling you that\n\n172\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.780\nSmartScreen Filter looks at, right?\n\n173\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.080\nWell, it's looking in this\ntrusted cert store and saying,\n\n174\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.160\nhey, do I trust that certificate that is\ntelling me I could trust this computer or\n\n175\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.500\nthis piece of software?\n\n176\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.094\nSo let me look here, and\nif I find it here, then I trust it.\n\n177\n00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:57.379\nIf I don't find it here,\nI'm gonna throw you a warning, it says,\n\n178\n00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.130\nit is an unrecognized app.\n\n179\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.270\nOr in this case,\nif it is a URL that you're visiting,\n\n180\n00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.350\nit says, well, I don't know who this is.\n\n181\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.431\nIt's presenting me this certificate,\nbut it isn't here.\n\n182\n00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:09.023\nSo that could have been Zach\njust firing up a web server and\n\n183\n00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:12.660\nthen issuing his own internal\ncertificate that we don't trust.\n\n184\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.439\nBecause it doesn't find it here.\n\n185\n00:10:13.439 --> 00:10:16.110\nSo that could give you that\ninvalid certificate, right?\n\n186\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.090\nSo that is one that I kinda wanted\nto let you guys know about.\n\n187\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.590\nAgain, you'll see Microsoft is in here.\n\n188\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.040\nThey're a root authority, and\nit just basically says that hey,\n\n189\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.630\nif I look at their certificate, right, I\ncould see that it's good for all purposes.\n\n190\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.856\nAnd it essentially says that, hey,\nlet me see if I double-click,\n\n191\n00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:35.642\nthere's the certificate,\nthat's what I want, right?\n\n192\n00:10:35.642 --> 00:10:40.070\nAnd it tells me it's issued\nto Microsoft by Microsoft.\n\n193\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.788\nAnd if you look at the details\nin the Certification Path,\n\n194\n00:10:42.788 --> 00:10:44.326\nMicrosoft is a root authority.\n\n195\n00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:47.467\nAnd it basically tells me that if I get\nsoftware from Microsoft, obviously,\n\n196\n00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:49.346\nit's Windows, I should trust it.\n\n197\n00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:52.898\nIf it's coming [LAUGH] from Microsoft, it\njust lets me know that my computer isn't\n\n198\n00:10:52.898 --> 00:10:56.454\ngonna throw me a flag that says, hey,\nI don't know where this came from, right?\n\n199\n00:10:56.454 --> 00:10:59.267\nIt's coming from Microsoft, so\nmy computer is going to trust it.\n\n200\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.125\nAll right, now, I do wanna mention\na couple of other things that, again,\n\n201\n00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:06.956\nthat we didn't talk about in\nthe first couple of parts now.\n\n202\n00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:11.652\nAnd that is the fact that there are times\nwhen you might have to go to the,\n\n203\n00:11:11.652 --> 00:11:15.710\nthey call out terminal here\nin the exam objectives.\n\n204\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.470\nBut terminal for\n\n205\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.370\nus really just means that we might\nhave to boot into our command prompt.\n\n206\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:26.035\nOr in this case as well,\nsometimes, even PowerShell today,\n\n207\n00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:28.828\nyeah, to fix our machines, right?\n\n208\n00:11:28.828 --> 00:11:31.796\nYou've seen in the first or\nthe second part, I believe it was Zach,\n\n209\n00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:34.740\nwhere we lost our\ngraphical user interface.\n\n210\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.145\nWell, I might have to boot into safe mode.\n\n211\n00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:40.420\nAnd if I boot into safe mode, I might have\nto run from the command prompt, right?\n\n212\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.004\nSo again, it might be a terminal-type\ncommunication where all I get,\n\n213\n00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:47.488\nall I'm gonna do is implement text,\nI'll get text-based output.\n\n214\n00:11:47.488 --> 00:11:50.410\nSo I do wanna make mention\nof that one there too.\n\n215\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.951\nOther thing that you might have to do,\nand I'll show you here on this Windows 7\n\n216\n00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:57.565\nmachine, is if I go to my charms menu,\nmy head's gonna kinda cover this one up.\n\n217\n00:11:57.565 --> 00:12:00.275\nBig headed, always typically does.\n\n218\n00:12:00.275 --> 00:12:02.264\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I go to Settings here,\n\n219\n00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:04.440\nthen I go to PC Settings.\n\n220\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.750\nAll right, and then I go down\nhere to Update and recovery.\n\n221\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.900\nThere might be a time,\nand then Recovery here.\n\n222\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.730\nRight, I might end up have,\nthere we go, sorry, guys.\n\n223\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.170\nI might end up having to do a refresh or\na restore, right?\n\n224\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.622\nIt really depends, right?\n\n225\n00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:24.901\nRestore, you can do a system restore, and\n\n226\n00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:29.830\na system restore is called\nspecifically by itself.\n\n227\n00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.156\nI think this is CompTIA's way of trying\nto remain a little bit vendor neutral.\n\n228\n00:12:34.156 --> 00:12:38.287\nBut you could do a refresher PC,\nwhich again, keep in mind,\n\n229\n00:12:38.287 --> 00:12:40.320\nthis is kinda like a restore.\n\n230\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.730\nIt restores the operating system\nwithout losing your photos.\n\n231\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.560\nBut you might have to do a complete\n\n232\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.920\nrestoration in the fact that you're\ngoing to essentially start over.\n\n233\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:59.386\nYou're gonna reset your entire Windows\noperating system to the factory setting,\n\n234\n00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:03.372\nbasically completely\nreinstalling everything.\n\n235\n00:13:03.372 --> 00:13:09.127\nSo that, they say, remove,\nyou'll see it in the recovery environment.\n\n236\n00:13:09.127 --> 00:13:10.900\nOr the pre-installation environment,\n\n237\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.930\nyou'll see it as a reset versus refresh,\nso understand those two.\n\n238\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.916\nOther places that you can use,\nand in fact,\n\n239\n00:13:18.916 --> 00:13:23.692\nwe might even be able to see this,\ncuz I don't think I reset anything.\n\n240\n00:13:23.692 --> 00:13:28.324\nBut you can also sometimes\nfind security-related issues\n\n241\n00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:30.520\ndown in your Event Viewer.\n\n242\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.552\nSo if I right-click on my Windows\ntile here and I choose Event Viewer,\n\n243\n00:13:35.552 --> 00:13:39.217\nand then we open up Event Viewer,\nI'm gonna go to,\n\n244\n00:13:39.217 --> 00:13:43.856\nI don't think it's gonna be as\neasy as security logs honestly.\n\n245\n00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:48.570\nCuz this is more about auditing your\nsystem, but we will check it out here.\n\n246\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.300\nI know there should be\nsome in our system logs.\n\n247\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.692\nAnd yeah, we just got successful audits.\n\n248\n00:13:55.692 --> 00:13:57.780\nSo let's go ahead and\ngo to system here real quick.\n\n249\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:06.049\nAnd I'm gonna filter the log and look for\ncritical error warning, choose OK.\n\n250\n00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:11.650\nThen let's see if we find anything in\nhere, find a group policy refreshes.\n\n251\n00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.630\nYep, we found our driver failed to load,\nthat's interesting.\n\n252\n00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.170\nThat does happen from time to time.\n\n253\n00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.990\nThat's not really, here's one, right?\n\n254\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.600\nSo we had that PC lockup earlier, right?\n\n255\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.260\nAnd it essentially, the system\nlocked up or it crashed, it stopped.\n\n256\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.680\nAnd I can see signs of that, that that\nmalware might be present there as well.\n\n257\n00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.911\nAnd I can see that here\ninside of our Event Viewer.\n\n258\n00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:38.340\nThe other thing that you might have to do\nis you might have to boot into safe mode.\n\n259\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.900\nAgain, this is part of just\nrestarting the computer in safe mode.\n\n260\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.046\nKeep in mind, we've shown you\nsafe mode in other episodes.\n\n261\n00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:48.686\nRemember that the reason that you're\nbooting into safe mode is that you're not\n\n262\n00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:52.294\nloading all the applications and\nthat most applications aren't gonna load.\n\n263\n00:14:52.294 --> 00:14:55.631\nAnd if a piece of malware has\nput an executable in there,\n\n264\n00:14:55.631 --> 00:14:57.270\nthat runs on a normal boot.\n\n265\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.290\nWhen you run in the safe mode, it might\nkeep it dormant, [LAUGH] if you will, and\n\n266\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.530\nit doesn't execute.\n\n267\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.800\nAnd this will allow you to do things like\nrun your Windows Defender software and\n\n268\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.200\nhopefully get that piece of\nmalware off of the system.\n\n269\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.040\nRemember, you can do this\ninside of the MSConfig, right?\n\n270\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.670\nYour system recovery or system information\nutility, system configuration.\n\n271\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.339\nI'll get it right eventually,\nsystem configuration.\n\n272\n00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:27.908\nYeah, they're one in the same,\nMSConfig, system configuration.\n\n273\n00:15:27.908 --> 00:15:30.700\nNow, the last thing,\nas far as the tools go,\n\n274\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.470\nthat I wanna mention,\nit's kind of a play on words.\n\n275\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.300\nIt's called a recover console.\n\n276\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.090\nEssentially, what I've showed you,\nfor instance,\n\n277\n00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:43.270\nlike the Windows Defender offline is\na form of a pre-installation environment.\n\n278\n00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.450\nIt's like a recovery console.\n\n279\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.104\nWe have the system recovery\noptions as well that we can use.\n\n280\n00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:51.349\nWhether it'd be a start-up repair, whether\nit be booting into the system recovery\n\n281\n00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:54.902\noptions and knowing the system\nrestore into an earlier point of time.\n\n282\n00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:55.792\nYou can do that as well.\n\n283\n00:15:55.792 --> 00:16:00.620\nNow, there is a process\nthat you should go through.\n\n284\n00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.405\nWhen you are going to remove malware.\n\n285\n00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:07.380\nAnd they talk about best practice\nprocedures for malware removal.\n\n286\n00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.390\nWell, we've already talked pretty\nextensively about the first step, right?\n\n287\n00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.180\nIdentifying the malware symptoms.\n\n288\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.000\nI've shown you some of the symptoms,\nlocking up the PC, memory leaks, right?\n\n289\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.440\nJust an overconsumption of the memory\nthat you have inside of the system until\n\n290\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.300\neventually we've shown the graphical\nuser interface disappears.\n\n291\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.930\nThe next thing that you need to do, and\nlet me go ahead and show you step two.\n\n292\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.908\nIn step two, here,\nyou're gonna actually, believe it or\n\n293\n00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.530\nnot you can go into your system restore,\nright?\n\n294\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.210\nWe're gonna right click\non our Windows tile here.\n\n295\n00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.310\nWe're gonna choose System.\n\n296\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.910\nNow, we're gonna go to System protection,\nright?\n\n297\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:46.250\nAnd I'm actually going to turn off,\nnow follow me on this one.\n\n298\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.950\nI'm going to turn off system restore,\nright.\n\n299\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.422\nI'm gonna disable system protection,\nall right and\n\n300\n00:16:54.422 --> 00:16:57.440\nI'm gonna let's do that again, configure.\n\n301\n00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.710\nI'm gonna disable system protection,.\n\n302\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.460\nI'm gonna choose apply.\n\n303\n00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.570\nNotice it tells me, are you sure you\nwanna turn off protection on this drive?\n\n304\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.960\nExisting restore points on\nthe disk will be deleted.\n\n305\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.510\nThat's what I want, all right?\n\n306\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.720\nBecause when a piece of software\ninstalls even if it is malware,\n\n307\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.650\nright, you could have a restore point.\n\n308\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.700\nThat was turned on or created at the\nmoment that the malware was installed and\n\n309\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.960\nguess what it is known\nin your restore point?\n\n310\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.000\nLittle bugs hanging out there, and when\nyou restore it to that earlier point in\n\n311\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.800\ntime what you're doing is you're\njust restoring the malware itself.\n\n312\n00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.990\nSo I'm gonna say yes to this right?\n\n313\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.650\nI know it kinda sounds like it's\ncounter productive all right.\n\n314\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.870\nBut I'm gonna do that,\nthat's the first thing I'm gonna do.\n\n315\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.080\nActually I will tell you that one of\nthe things that I should do beforehand\n\n316\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.810\neven more so, is I should come up here,\nand I should quarantine the system.\n\n317\n00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.390\nAnd one of the ways that you can\nquarantine the system, the best way?\n\n318\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.080\nDisconnect the adapter.\n\n319\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.000\nSo let me go ahead and\nstep back a second, and remember,\n\n320\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.120\nidentify the malware symptoms, quarantine\nthe system, remove it from the network.\n\n321\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.420\nTake it right off the network, right?\n\n322\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.480\nIn this case, what I did is I disabled\nthe network adapter altogether.\n\n323\n00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.960\nIt's kinda like no different from\npulling the plug on the network adapter.\n\n324\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.870\nThen we disable.\n\n325\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.920\nIf you're in Windows,\nyou disable system restore, all right?\n\n326\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.060\nNow you're gonna remediate the effected\nsystem, the infected system.\n\n327\n00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.290\nNow one of the things they\ncall out is they say,\n\n328\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.873\nupdate your anti-malware software.\n\n329\n00:18:19.873 --> 00:18:24.150\nWait a second, if I quarantined\nthe system how do I update\n\n330\n00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.720\nsoftware if I took it off the network?\n\n331\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.950\nAll right,\nhere's where it gets a little tricky.\n\n332\n00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.370\nYou have to go out to something like,\nin fact let's switch over here and\n\n333\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.860\nget away from that SSL.\n\n334\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:40.741\nAnd let me show you Windows Defend,\nor definitions.\n\n335\n00:18:42.951 --> 00:18:44.579\nOffline.\n\n336\n00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:46.190\nAll right?\n\n337\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.469\nSo I can go and I can look for\nthe latest Windows updates gor\n\n338\n00:18:50.469 --> 00:18:55.710\nWindows Defender, all right,\nand it can give me the version.\n\n339\n00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.920\nAnd this is, what is today's date?\n\n340\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.830\nDo you know, Zach?\n\n341\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.880\nI think it is-\n&gt;&gt; It's the second.\n\n342\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.890\n&gt;&gt; It is the second, so these were updated\n\n343\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.770\ntoday as the recording that we're doing\nright now, they were updated today.\n\n344\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.600\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n345\n00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.270\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n346\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.460\nwhat I can do is I can download these,\nright?\n\n347\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.690\nI can come to here and I can say yes,\n\n348\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.080\nI know I've got a machine that I\nknow is quarantined, all right?\n\n349\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.500\nAnd I need the 64 bits.\n\n350\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.640\nWindows 8.1 definitions.\n\n351\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.662\nAnd now I've got this little\nexecutable right here.\n\n352\n00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:26.230\nAll right?\n\n353\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.220\nWell what I do is I put\nthat on a USB thumb drive,\n\n354\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.110\nI walk it back over to my\nWindows machine that doesn't\n\n355\n00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:39.110\nhave a network connection and\nI load it up into that machine.\n\n356\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:44.359\nAnd I kinda already got this turkey\nbaked and I run it from here.\n\n357\n00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.970\nRight?\nNow what I can do\n\n358\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.890\nis I can update the virus software\nwithout having an internet connection.\n\n359\n00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.590\nThen again, I now have the latest and\ngreatest definitions or updates.\n\n360\n00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.430\nAll right?\n&gt;&gt; That is brilliant.\n\n361\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.880\n&gt;&gt; Now the other thing\nthat you can do too,\n\n362\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.960\nis you can do the scan and\nthe removal, right?\n\n363\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.820\nI can do it from an online environment.\n\n364\n00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.630\nIf I do it from an online environment that\nmeans I'm gonna run Windows Defender from\n\n365\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.730\nthe inside of the operating system.\n\n366\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.540\nHowever.\nLet me get back to my desktop here.\n\n367\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.100\nYou might have to do this offline\nlike I showed you earlier, right?\n\n368\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.550\nIf you do it offline, that means\nI'm going to reboot, let me see.\n\n369\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.750\nDoesn't look like that's running.\n\n370\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.150\nIt might give me a hard time\nabout that but we'll see.\n\n371\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.200\nBut I can also do this from the offline\nenvironment as well, all right.\n\n372\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.430\nAnd it really depends on how bad\nthe system might be running.\n\n373\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.950\nIn this case you can see that we\ngot some issues going on here.\n\n374\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.735\nI can't even get the software to run.\n\n375\n00:20:40.735 --> 00:20:41.240\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n376\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.130\nSo in that case, what I might do,\nis I might reboot the machine.\n\n377\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.400\nAnd actually run Windows Defender Offline,\nright?\n\n378\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.770\nRun from the pre-installation environment,\nrun it from a recovery console.\n\n379\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.230\nSo that I can run it against the hard\ndrive that is no longer running and\n\n380\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.730\nmore importantly, executables\naren't executing on the machine\n\n381\n00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.760\nat the moment that I'm trying\nto run the scan, right?\n\n382\n00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.260\nBut, we'll go ahead, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll go a little bit farther.\n\n383\n00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.521\nWe'll do an online scan here.\n\n384\n00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:07.980\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and go back to\nour modern UI and we'll do a defender.\n\n385\n00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.859\nAnd I could run and I could scan this,\nnotice it's telling me that I should be\n\n386\n00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:19.000\nscanning this, I'll do just a basic scan\nhere and let's see, I'll scan the E drive.\n\n387\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.180\nAgain, because we don't have a lot of\ntime, this is only a half hour show and\n\n388\n00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.350\nif it's a terabyte drive,\nit could take a very long time, right?\n\n389\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.340\nAnd you can see that it scans certain\nitems, you can do a quick scan.\n\n390\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.254\nKeep in mind you can do a full scan.\n\n391\n00:21:33.254 --> 00:21:39.040\nQuick scan just has common locations\nare known to contain viruses.\n\n392\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.400\nI could also run updates from here and\nI can update the definitions, but\n\n393\n00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.290\nkeep in mind that the definitions\ncan also be updated, if you will,\n\n394\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.780\nvia offline updates if you\nare quarantined in the system.\n\n395\n00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.982\nNow, the next thing that you also want\nto do is you want to schedule scans too.\n\n396\n00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:58.122\nYou wanna make sure the scans they\nrun on a regular basis, right.\n\n397\n00:21:58.122 --> 00:22:01.780\nYou wanna make sure that you have\nreal time protection turned on.\n\n398\n00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.950\nOnce your scan is finished again,\nthen what you're gonna come back and\n\n399\n00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.670\ndo is you're gonna go ahead and\nenable your Windows update.\n\n400\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.360\nLet me go ahead and let this scan.\n\n401\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.530\nLooks like it was doing a quick\nscan against the C: drive as well.\n\n402\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.115\nWell, we'll let this go ahead and\nrun, I tell you what.\n\n403\n00:22:22.115 --> 00:22:25.290\nAgain, custom scan data drive,\n\n404\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.220\njust wanna make sure here that I haven't\nincluded anything else that shouldn't be.\n\n405\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.805\nWe'll try that one more time,\nand we'll do a scan.\n\n406\n00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:35.530\nNow, custom scan's kind of interesting\nbecause sometimes what a custom scan\n\n407\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.084\nwill do is it'll do a quick scan which\nyou can see it, common locations.\n\n408\n00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:42.300\nAnd on any additional drive\nwhich you have included.\n\n409\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.850\nSo, it's customized but\nit's actually a customized Quick Scan\n\n410\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:52.102\nmore than anything so that's why it's kind\nof taking you a little bit long here.\n\n411\n00:22:52.102 --> 00:22:56.350\nAnd again, half hour show we don't really\nhave a lot of time to wait on this but\n\n412\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.140\nI'll go over some of the settings here\nthat I want you to know for the exam.\n\n413\n00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.590\nIn the background,\nnotice that this is the way you turn on or\n\n414\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.940\noff the real time protection,\n\n415\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.170\nthis is whether Windows is going to\nbe running Windows Defender or not.\n\n416\n00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.540\nExcluding file and locations, right,\nso I might say and in fact I've got\n\n417\n00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.490\nthe data drive there because I didn't want\nthe EICAR virus strand to be scanned and\n\n418\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.000\nessentially taking off of the machine\nbefore I could show you guys\n\n419\n00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.750\nthe fact that it's a virus, and it's\nnot a virus, but you know what I mean.\n\n420\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.120\nThe fact that what it would look\nlike if it did find a virus.\n\n421\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.550\nSo I got an exclusion there.\n\n422\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.374\nCertain file types I might say that I\nwant to exclude processes, if you will.\n\n423\n00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:41.154\nNow, Advanced, keep in mind,\nadvanced is where you scan archive files,\n\n424\n00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:45.740\nremovable drives, and\nas well as how long do you want to keep\n\n425\n00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.821\nquarantine files before they're\npermanently removed as well.\n\n426\n00:23:50.821 --> 00:23:56.225\nAnd then you have MAPS as well,\nMicrosoft Active Protection Service, too.\n\n427\n00:23:56.225 --> 00:23:59.073\nDepends on if you want what kind\nof membership you want on that.\n\n428\n00:23:59.073 --> 00:24:04.452\nSo Interestingly enough,\nyou could set some of those settings, too.\n\n429\n00:24:04.452 --> 00:24:04.987\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n430\n00:24:04.987 --> 00:24:09.591\n&gt;&gt; History, right, quarantined items,\nallowed items, all detected items, but\n\n431\n00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:12.003\nessentially gives you what you need to do.\n\n432\n00:24:12.003 --> 00:24:15.253\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this scan\nhere, and then I'm gonna close this down.\n\n433\n00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:19.442\nBecause then the next thing you do\nafter you run your scan is you run your\n\n434\n00:24:19.442 --> 00:24:20.578\nupdates, right?\n\n435\n00:24:20.578 --> 00:24:25.670\nOnce the scan is done, I'm gonna come\nback here after the system is remediated.\n\n436\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.640\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna connect it back to the network,\n\n437\n00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.660\nand then I'm gonna run Windows Update.\n\n438\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:35.580\nAfter I run Windows Update, then I'm\ngonna come back in as part of step six.\n\n439\n00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.840\nI'm gonna go to System, and\n\n440\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.670\nthen I'm gonna go to System Protection and\nI'm gonna turn system protection back on.\n\n441\n00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.113\nAnd I'll choose OK, and\nthen I'm gonna create a restore point.\n\n442\n00:24:46.113 --> 00:24:52.704\nI might say initial scan, and\nI might say something like checkpoint,\n\n443\n00:24:52.704 --> 00:24:59.082\njust so I know that, hey,\nthis is after I thought there was a virus.\n\n444\n00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:04.681\nI created a restore point, and\nI've also enabled System Restore.\n\n445\n00:25:04.681 --> 00:25:08.014\nNow, you might think,\nafter we've done that, right,\n\n446\n00:25:08.014 --> 00:25:10.862\nafter we've identified\nthe malware symptoms,\n\n447\n00:25:10.862 --> 00:25:15.254\nwe've removed its network connection,\nwe've quarantined the system.\n\n448\n00:25:15.254 --> 00:25:18.557\nWe've disabled System Restore, what else,\n\n449\n00:25:18.557 --> 00:25:24.310\nwe remediated the infected system by\nupdating our anti-malware software.\n\n450\n00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:30.850\nWe have essentially run a scan,\n\n451\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:35.540\nrun our updates, turned around, enabled\nSystem Restore, created a restore point.\n\n452\n00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.539\nYou might think, well, you're done.\n\n453\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.765\nNo, we're not done.\n\n454\n00:25:38.765 --> 00:25:41.458\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The last thing you have to do is make\n\n455\n00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:44.256\nsure that you let your end\nuser know what's going on.\n\n456\n00:25:44.256 --> 00:25:47.460\nTo me, this is second nature.\n\n457\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.390\nWhen I run these scans, in fact,\nthere's a lot of other things I do, too.\n\n458\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.340\nThis is just basically what\nCompTIA wants you to know.\n\n459\n00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.723\nThere's other things I do, like I'll run\nthe Malicious Software Removal Tool kit,\n\n460\n00:25:56.723 --> 00:25:59.240\nMRT, in fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you that.\n\n461\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.060\nYeah, this will just be for\nyou guys' benefit out there more so.\n\n462\n00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.330\nI don't think it's really\ngonna be on the exam, and\n\n463\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.120\nit's not called out in the objectives.\n\n464\n00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.313\nBut I can also go to MRT, and\nif you've done your Windows Update,\n\n465\n00:26:09.313 --> 00:26:12.409\nthis is why running your\nWindows Update is so important, too.\n\n466\n00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:18.790\nCuz if I type mrt, notice that I have\nthe mrt little executable right here.\n\n467\n00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.660\nThis allows me to run what's known\n\n468\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.625\nas Microsoft's Malicious\nSoftware Removal Tool kit.\n\n469\n00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:29.990\nA couple differences between this and\nWindows Defender.\n\n470\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.610\nWindows Defender is real-time protection,\nit's a proactive solution.\n\n471\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.070\nThe Malicious Software Removal\nkit is a reactive situation.\n\n472\n00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.001\nThat's after you already know you've got\nsoftware that you shouldn't have on your\n\n473\n00:26:40.001 --> 00:26:40.711\ncomputer, right?\n\n474\n00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:43.587\nSo that's after the fact,\nright, that's reactive,\n\n475\n00:26:43.587 --> 00:26:47.650\nversus Defender being proactive and\nactively doing real-time protection.\n\n476\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.857\nBut again, you can see that you can\nalso do things like those quick scans,\n\n477\n00:26:50.857 --> 00:26:52.476\nfull scans, and customized scans.\n\n478\n00:26:52.476 --> 00:26:57.330\nBut that's all part of running\nyour Windows Updates as well.\n\n479\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.180\nRemember to educate your users.\n\n480\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.430\nYou might be aware, you might do\nthis 10 times a day, 15 times a day.\n\n481\n00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.460\nYou might have done it\n100 times in the past,\n\n482\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.030\nbut your end user might\nnever have done that.\n\n483\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.380\nSo let them know why they\nshould be running scans,\n\n484\n00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.310\nwhy they should be scheduling scans,\nright?\n\n485\n00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:17.120\nWhy they should stay away from different\nwebsites, pay attention to their emails,\n\n486\n00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.940\npay attention to some of\nthe problems that can happen.\n\n487\n00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.214\nAnd then just make sure that\nthey don't turn off security,\n\n488\n00:27:22.214 --> 00:27:23.814\nmake sure that security is implemented.\n\n489\n00:27:23.814 --> 00:27:25.516\nFollow those procedures, and\n\n490\n00:27:25.516 --> 00:27:29.190\nyou will do well when it comes to\nyour basic computing experience.\n\n491\n00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.945\n&gt;&gt; Wes, wonderful job as usual,\nthank you so very much.\n\n492\n00:27:31.945 --> 00:27:35.266\nTroubleshoot PC Security Issues,\nthis has been part 3.\n\n493\n00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:36.795\nThere's a part 1 and a part 2.\n\n494\n00:27:36.795 --> 00:27:38.620\nMake sure you watch all three parts.\n\n495\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.821\nAnd there's a lot of video content\nin the CompTIA A+ 902 series.\n\n496\n00:27:42.821 --> 00:27:45.930\nMake sure you watch all of them,\nyou'll be very glad you did.\n\n497\n00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.789\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n498\n00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:50.470\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n499\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.290\nI'm Zach

[CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; What not to do.\n\n45\n00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:10.146\n&gt;&gt; Put your face as close don't do that.\n\n46\n00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:14.076\n&gt;&gt; That's right what not to do when\nit comes to cracked screens, right?\n\n47\n00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:14.649\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n48\n00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.001\n&gt;&gt; We just sit there and\nwe rub our fingers across the glass,\n\n49\n00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.187\nyeah were not gonna do that.\n\n50\n00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:20.604\n&gt;&gt; I could check my blood\nsugar I guess that's good.\n\n51\n00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.285\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, absolutely medic.\n\n52\n00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:24.371\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; In stitches.\n\n53\n00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:25.135\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n54\n00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:26.444\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:30.820\nwe'll dive into the very first topic\nthat they really called out here.\n\n56\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.915\nAnd they talk about some common\nsymptoms are a dim display.\n\n57\n00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:35.825\nNow dim display is very, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's not a very\n\n58\n00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:37.461\nnice thing to say about your display.\n\n59\n00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:41.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry you know exactly, but one\nof the things that you have to worry about\n\n60\n00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:45.480\nwith a dim display more than anything,\nit really is a setting.\n\n61\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.426\nAnd when it comes down to it a lot\nof times it's just a slider bar,\n\n62\n00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:51.168\nin fact you can see,\nlet me show you here on my desktop here.\n\n63\n00:02:51.168 --> 00:02:52.921\nYou'll see that we've got again,\n\n64\n00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.890\nthe common mobile operating systems\nthat we've been dealing with here.\n\n65\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.993\nAnd if I kinda slide down from the top\nyou'll notice that we have this little\n\n66\n00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:00.543\nslider bar.\n\n67\n00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:04.290\nAnd you'll notice the little sun\nicon on the left hand side here.\n\n68\n00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.440\nNow understand that this really isn't\nadjusting anything on our screen, right?\n\n69\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.285\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Is it causing the eclipse right now.\n\n70\n00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:10.785\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:12.107\n&gt;&gt; That's actually, yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:13.660\nAnd you know that's interesting that Dan\n\n73\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.487\nsays that because of\nthe time this is recording.\n\n74\n00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:16.904\nMaybe some of you will know this\n\n75\n00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:19.685\nis the great American solar eclipse,\nand not that it's only\n\n76\n00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:21.219\nhappening in America, right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n77\n00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.779\n&gt;&gt; But it is coming across America as we\n\n78\n00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:23.660\nspeak, right.\nSo\n\n79\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.466\nI am actually controlling that out there.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n80\n00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] With your Samsung S4.\n\n81\n00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.396\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\n\n82\n00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:31.532\nI'm dimming the entire Earth, right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Good job on controlling that Samsung.\n\n84\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.151\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nThat's a lot of power\n\n85\n00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:35.910\nright there in your hands.\n\n86\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.691\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty impressive.\n\n87\n00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:40.356\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So keep in mind sometimes that can be\n\n88\n00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:41.031\nall it is, right.\n\n89\n00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:41.556\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n90\n00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:44.360\nhere let me tell you where this\ngets me in trouble sometimes.\n\n91\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.493\nWhen you go out and you are in front of or\n\n92\n00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:49.038\nunder I guess I should\nsay a bright sunlight.\n\n93\n00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:52.649\nAnd you can't see anything,\nwhen you are in direct sunlight,\n\n94\n00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.045\nthese screens really don't do too well.\n\n95\n00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:56.617\nEven if they are on the brightest setting.\n\n96\n00:03:56.617 --> 00:03:58.855\nIt's even worse if you're like me,\n\n97\n00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:02.860\nyou're like okay I wanna take\nsome power saving best practices.\n\n98\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.260\nI'm gonna kind of dim the screen out cuz\nDan and I are in the studios right now.\n\n99\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.220\nIn fact I can kinda rubber neck and\nlook over his phone.\n\n100\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.033\nAnd I know that his screen\nsettings are set really dim, why?\n\n101\n00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:17.206\nWell, because for half hour periods at\na time we're not looking in our screen.\n\n102\n00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:20.030\nSo there's no reason to have\nit chewing up the battery.\n\n103\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.212\nProblem is if Dan had to take a phone call\nright away, it says you know okay after\n\n104\n00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:25.590\nthis episode, it says hey let\nme step outside real quick.\n\n105\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.820\nWell, you might not be able\nto see the slider bar, right?\n\n106\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.162\nBecause the moment you get into direct sun\nlight with a dim screen it becomes next to\n\n107\n00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:33.380\nimpossible to see anything.\n\n108\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.660\nSo that could be very basically\nall that it is, right.\n\n109\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.196\nIt could be a setting like that.\n\n110\n00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:44.360\nMake sure of course that the device itself\ndoesn't have physical damage, all right.\n\n111\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.386\nAnd the reason I said that is because\nevery mobile device has typically what's\n\n112\n00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:50.461\nknown as some kind of back light source.\n\n113\n00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:54.399\nIn earlier days and even in very, very,\nvery small devices you might have what's\n\n114\n00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.440\nknown as a sidelight,\nmore than often it's just a backlight.\n\n115\n00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.492\nAnd a lot of times it's just a traditional\nOLED screen that you would see more full\n\n116\n00:05:01.492 --> 00:05:04.430\nsize, they're very good for\nsmall form factor devices.\n\n117\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.177\nSo if it is a dim screen\nlike that also make sure,\n\n118\n00:05:07.177 --> 00:05:10.905\nagain that it's not some kind\nof power saving profile, right.\n\n119\n00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:15.395\nYou do have applications that you can\nput on your phone, that if you give them\n\n120\n00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:19.325\nthe right permissions they can\ncontrol the power of your device and\n\n121\n00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.243\nautomatically dim the screen.\n\n122\n00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:22.189\nIf that happens,\n\n123\n00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.980\nit could be one of the reasons that\nyou're seeing a dim screen, right.\n\n124\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.976\nAlright, so here's another one that\nhappens to just about everybody, and\n\n125\n00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:34.465\nsometimes even on a daily basis,\nand this is intermittent wireless.\n\n126\n00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:38.255\nNow when we look at intermittent wireless\nthere could be ahandful of things,\n\n127\n00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:41.074\nI will tell you one of the most\ncommon things that happen.\n\n128\n00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:45.900\nOr the cause I should say of\nintermittent wireless signals is really\n\n129\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.380\njust proximity through the axis point,\nright.\n\n130\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just something like the outskirts\nof the actual connectivity area of\n\n131\n00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:54.915\nthe axis point, right?\n\n132\n00:05:54.915 --> 00:05:58.272\nYou're just kinda like phasing in and\nout of it, or maybe your power push or\n\n133\n00:05:58.272 --> 00:05:58.940\nwhatever.\n\n134\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.204\nAnd then you're picking it up and then\ndropping it, picking it up and dropping,\n\n135\n00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:03.123\nit's very annoying.\n\n136\n00:06:03.123 --> 00:06:05.711\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and in fact you\nmentioned this, I believe it was Dan and\n\n137\n00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:07.486\nI when we were talking\nabout some of the features.\n\n138\n00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:10.896\nWe're talking about connectivity in\ngeneral, I think you mentioned obstacles,\n\n139\n00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:12.850\nthings being in your way, right?\n\n140\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.187\nIf you've ever gone into a place, for\ninstance one of the places I can tell you\n\n141\n00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:20.084\nis if you have a lot of\nelectromagnetic shielding.\n\n142\n00:06:20.084 --> 00:06:23.173\nNow I'm not talking strange, as you guys\ngo on to more advanced security training\n\n143\n00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:25.480\nyou'll learn about things\ncalled tempus shield and stuff.\n\n144\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.022\nSo I'm not really talking\nabout the tinfoil hat, but\n\n145\n00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:31.412\nif you into a place that has a lot of\nelectromagnetic shielding you could\n\n146\n00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:34.713\nsee intermittent wireless from\nwhatever the signal connection is.\n\n147\n00:06:34.713 --> 00:06:36.978\nBut a lot of times, more often than not,\n\n148\n00:06:36.978 --> 00:06:39.840\nit's going to be proximity\nto the access point.\n\n149\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.938\nNow the other thing that can happen too\nis it could be power saving setting.\n\n150\n00:06:43.938 --> 00:06:46.740\nThere again,\nit could be turning off things.\n\n151\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.236\nIf you have profiles set,\n\n152\n00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:52.724\nagain it could be something that it says\nafter a certain amount of inactivity,\n\n153\n00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:57.419\ndisable certain functionality or features\nwithin the operating system itself.\n\n154\n00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.695\nSo again, most commonly though\nintermittent wireless signals are gonna be\n\n155\n00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:04.716\nreally just relative,\nmaybe not even to the device.\n\n156\n00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.740\nNow it could be on the access point side.\n\n157\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.108\nWe've already talked about that in other\nepisodes, just talking about wireless\n\n158\n00:07:10.108 --> 00:07:13.054\nnetworks in general and securing\nthings like your SOHO environments.\n\n159\n00:07:13.054 --> 00:07:16.640\nCould just be your access point, could be\ncausing the problem more than anything.\n\n160\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.280\n&gt;&gt; And so is a good time when somebody\nsticks the access point on top of\n\n161\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.460\nthe microwave at your break room and\nthen people start eating up the burritos.\n\n162\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n163\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.966\n&gt;&gt; And you're going,\nwhy does my wireless keep dropping?\n\n164\n00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:26.466\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n165\n00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:28.291\nAnd it really comes down to the,\n\n166\n00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:31.547\nnow we're talking about\na standards issue too, right.\n\n167\n00:07:31.547 --> 00:07:33.062\nYou talk about a standards issue,\n\n168\n00:07:33.062 --> 00:07:35.893\n2.4 gigahertz spectrum's been around for\na very long time.\n\n169\n00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:37.505\nThat's the ISM band if you guys are not,\n\n170\n00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:40.968\nladies and gents out there aren't aware of\nit, that's the industrial scientific and\n\n171\n00:07:40.968 --> 00:07:42.467\nmedical band.\nAnd guess what?\n\n172\n00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:43.373\nLike Dan mentioned,\n\n173\n00:07:43.373 --> 00:07:46.556\none of the things that's in that range\nis things like microwaves, right.\n\n174\n00:07:46.556 --> 00:07:49.470\nOlder, I'd say other cell phones, but\n\n175\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.871\nolder just regular land lines and\n\n176\n00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.250\nwireless phones.\n\n177\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.900\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Cordless phones.\n\n178\n00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.400\n&gt;&gt; Cordless phones, thank you.\n\n179\n00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n180\n00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.475\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was trying to,\n\n181\n00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.039\n&gt;&gt; It's been so long since we've had\n\n182\n00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:56.815\nto say that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:07:56.815 --> 00:07:57.315\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n184\n00:07:57.315 --> 00:08:00.501\nBecause some of them are going well beyond\n\n185\n00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:05.250\n2.4 gigahertz, but it is, right?\nAgain, it's a very\n\n186\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.399\ncongested type of communication frequency.\nAnd\n\n187\n00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:13.040\nbecause of congestion, you could\nget intermittent wireless signals.\n\n188\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.210\nJust because again, the access point\nmaybe can't handle all the bandwidth.\n\n189\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.620\nBut understand that's not really something\nthat you can really control with\n\n190\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.890\nthe device itself.\n\n191\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.030\nThey're, I mean,\nvery limited the things that you can do.\n\n192\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.570\nIn fact if we show my screen here, I kind\nof jumped into this in one other episode\n\n193\n00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.660\non accident by misdialling,\nnot that that ever happens.\n\n194\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.995\nYou guys know I'm kidding out there.\n\n195\n00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:33.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Follow along with me with\n\n196\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.400\nmy typing here.\n\n197\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.490\nBut you do have what's known\nas an RSS indicator, or\n\n198\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.100\nRSS if you will relative\nsignal strength indicator.\n\n199\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.100\nNot much that you can really tweak here,\nright?\n\n200\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.060\nAnd it's not only things\nlike your wireless.\n\n201\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.835\nYou'll see this is also talking about\nglobal systems mobile and LTE, right.\n\n202\n00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:56.030\nSo, even if they're talking wireless\nhere more than anything else, so\n\n203\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.009\nI would only assume that\nthey're talking Wi-Fi.\n\n204\n00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:02.511\nBut again, keep in mind that we're not\ntalking just Wi-Fi when we talk about any\n\n205\n00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:03.550\nkind of mobile device.\n\n206\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.480\nWe're also talking about things like,\nfor instance,\n\n207\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.750\nyour cellular communications too.\n\n208\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:14.250\nBut, again, kind of limited as to what you\nmight be able to fix with that, all right.\n\n209\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.496\nNow, the next thing, this could be\nuser error and I have seen that, and\n\n210\n00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:24.649\nthey do call out no wireless connectivity\nversus intermittent wireless connectivity.\n\n211\n00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:26.100\nNow there's quite a few things.\n\n212\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.100\nWell, I say quite a few things,\nit's a handful of things.\n\n213\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.490\nIt could really be the problem here.\n\n214\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.450\nUnderstand that in any one of these\nissues so far that we've talked about,\n\n215\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.560\nit could be the fact that\nyou've got a damaged device.\n\n216\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.420\nNot likely when it comes\nto wireless adapter.\n\n217\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.710\nA lot of times, the components outside\nof the GPU or the CPUs that are in them,\n\n218\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.320\ncuz you can fry them in the batteries,\nmore specifically.\n\n219\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.476\nMost of the components that\na lot of these devices,\n\n220\n00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:56.280\nthey have a very [LAUGH] long life and\n\n221\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.516\na lot of times they out live the devices,\nservice, if you will.\n\n222\n00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:04.977\nBut one of the things that it could be,\ncould be that the fact that the wireless\n\n223\n00:10:04.977 --> 00:10:08.042\nadapter is turned off, all right,\nthat could be no connectivity.\n\n224\n00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:11.430\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nin fact, we kind of zoom out here and\n\n225\n00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.990\nI brig you back to that setting.\n\n226\n00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.708\nWe've kinda looked at this,\nright, enable versus disabled.\n\n227\n00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:20.462\nIf I disable the wireless device,\nwell, guess what?\n\n228\n00:10:20.462 --> 00:10:23.760\nThat's gonna mean that I'm not gonna\nhave any wireless connections,right?\n\n229\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.910\nSo it could be as simple as a button that\nyou've pushed, I know I've done that\n\n230\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.790\nbefore when I tried in the Android,\nright, when I tried to swipe that menu.\n\n231\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.310\nOr if you're in your iOS device,\nswiping up from the bottom.\n\n232\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.300\nThere you go, you've got your little\nwireless connection button right there.\n\n233\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.650\nNow with this one,\nI really don't wanna disconnect it yet.\n\n234\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.670\nI will here in a second,\n\n235\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.220\nbut we will lose the ability-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n236\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.290\n&gt;&gt; To see the screen because\nof the fact that it is.\n\n237\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.000\nWell, in fact,\nthat one's kinda interesting.\n\n238\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.410\nThis one also kinda kicked me out too.\n\n239\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.256\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee what's going on with that one.\n\n240\n00:10:55.256 --> 00:11:02.254\nI might have to, yeah, we want to launch\nit, and apparently, this one did reboot.\n\n241\n00:11:02.254 --> 00:11:05.547\nSo again, you can see sometimes\nit does cause issues, so\n\n242\n00:11:05.547 --> 00:11:07.685\nwe do wanna be careful with that one.\n\n243\n00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:08.443\n&gt;&gt; Prime example of it\nright here on the show.\n\n244\n00:11:08.443 --> 00:11:10.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n245\n00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:14.704\nI'll kind of go ahead and what we'll do\nis we'll reboot this phone, and again,\n\n246\n00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:15.989\nyou see when you have.\n\n247\n00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:20.115\nThat was an intermittent connection there\ntoo, that it does cause problems, right?\n\n248\n00:11:20.115 --> 00:11:23.925\nBut there again, this is a wireless,\nit could cause problems.\n\n249\n00:11:23.925 --> 00:11:28.070\nNow I will tell you one of the things\nthat they do call out on the exam.\n\n250\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.804\nWhile we're here, we might as well go\nahead and tackle this when I know I'm\n\n251\n00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:34.906\njumping down on the list in our\nobjectives there on you, Dan.\n\n252\n00:11:34.906 --> 00:11:36.600\nGoing off of the beaten path.\n\n253\n00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.891\nRight, why do we have notes anyway?\n\n254\n00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:38.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:42.258\n&gt;&gt; It's the fact that unable to broadcast\n\n256\n00:11:42.258 --> 00:11:45.060\nto an external monitor.\n\n257\n00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.425\nThat is something that can happen,\nand if you are unable to broadcast to\n\n258\n00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:53.160\nan external monitor,\nit could be a Wi-Fi setting, right?\n\n259\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.343\nIt really kind of depends\non about what you are talk,\n\n260\n00:11:57.343 --> 00:12:02.260\nwhat is the setting that\nmight be causing the issue?\n\n261\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.791\nOne of the things that can cause the issue\nis just the fact that Wi-Fi is disabled.\n\n262\n00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:10.080\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you\nwhile I'm rebooting this device here,\n\n263\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.966\nI'll show you what I'm saying.\n\n264\n00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:14.947\nIn fact while this is\nrebooting over there,\n\n265\n00:12:14.947 --> 00:12:17.938\nwe'll go ahead and\njump in to our iPad here.\n\n266\n00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:22.053\nNow with the iPad,\nlet's see if we can bring this up,\n\n267\n00:12:22.053 --> 00:12:25.710\nI have what's known as AirPlay going,\nright,\n\n268\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.386\nthat's your screen sharing\nsoftware there in iOS, right?\n\n269\n00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:33.052\nBut, what happens?\n\n270\n00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:36.477\nRight, here's no wireless connectivity and\n\n271\n00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:40.165\nunable to communicate with\nan external monitor or\n\n272\n00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:44.659\nbroadcast to an external monitor\nwhat could be the problem?\n\n273\n00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:45.692\nLet me show you.\n\n274\n00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:48.100\nHere's another setting\nthat might get flipped and\n\n275\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.360\nyou don't even know it and\nthat's the little Airplane mode up here.\n\n276\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.230\nNotice that we have Airplane mode,\n\n277\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.360\nthis can cause all kinds of havoc\nif you're not paying attention.\n\n278\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.926\nIn fact, let's see if I can get into that.\n\n279\n00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:01.920\nIt might be as simple as turning it on.\n\n280\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.747\nNow if I go into Airplane mode, one of the\nthings I'm kind of moving the screen back\n\n281\n00:13:05.747 --> 00:13:09.810\nhere in the background, you'll notice that\nyou don't see anything moving, right?\n\n282\n00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:16.620\nOne of the reasons you can't see it is I'm\nno longer broadcasting my MacBook, right.\n\n283\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.960\nI can't broadcast to the external monitor,\nso that's another reason.\n\n284\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.660\nNo wireless connectivity,\n\n285\n00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.140\ncould be the fact that you've\ngot Airplane mode turned on.\n\n286\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.550\nIf you do, it turned off all of\nthe radios within the device.\n\n287\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.720\nWhether it's the wireless adapter,\nwhether it's a cellular adapter,\n\n288\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.210\nor whether it's a Bluetooth adapter.\n\n289\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.240\nSo, let me go ahead and take it out\nof our, and you see it close down\n\n290\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.160\ncuz wireless came back on, let me go ahead\nand take it out of the Airplane mode.\n\n291\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.260\nAnd just real quick,\nI kinda have to relaunch my software here.\n\n292\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.350\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, Wes, we turn off all the\ncommunication stuff inside of our device\n\n293\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.207\nand it stops communicating,\npretty strange.\n\n294\n00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:55.530\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nimagine how that works, right?\n\n295\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:00.293\nNow if I go back to, and I want you guys\nto kinda see this, and let me leave this\n\n296\n00:14:00.293 --> 00:14:05.218\nopen, because this is what I see and once\nI reboot it or turn Airplane mode Off.\n\n297\n00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:08.182\nI've seen all of these\ndevices that AirPlay or\n\n298\n00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:13.658\nthe screen sharing software would allow\nme, right, to see once Wi-Fi came back on.\n\n299\n00:14:13.658 --> 00:14:16.873\nNow I can broadcast again\nto the external monitor.\n\n300\n00:14:16.873 --> 00:14:19.092\nSo you do have that ability,\n\n301\n00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:24.740\nyou just have to keep in mind what\nmight be actually causing the problem.\n\n302\n00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.340\nSo if no wireless connectivity,\none of the things that might happen,\n\n303\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.660\nlike we talked about is the Wi-Fi\nadapter might be turned off.\n\n304\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.170\nYou might have something like your\nproximity to the access point.\n\n305\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.180\nThat's one thing that I've mentioned,\nit all comes in handy or\n\n306\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.350\ncomes into play if I'm too far away\nfrom the wireless access point.\n\n307\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.550\nGuess what?\n\n308\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.290\nI don't get any wireless connectivity.\n\n309\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.400\nThat's just as simple as that.\n\n310\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.900\nI can't communicate with the AP,\nno connectivity.\n\n311\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.290\nAirplane mode was another big one,\nthat does happen.\n\n312\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.710\nAnd sometimes people forget\nthey turn this on and\n\n313\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.180\nthey don't understand why\nthey can't communicate.\n\n314\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.810\nOr, if we can go real quick\nback to my screen here, again,\n\n315\n00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.794\nit could be something where you're\nusing those quick settings.\n\n316\n00:15:03.794 --> 00:15:08.010\nAnd all I had to do was accidentally push\nthis little airplane button right here,\n\n317\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.310\nand all of a sudden\neverything is disabled.\n\n318\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.180\nNow, I went ahead and\ngot his Android device turned back on.\n\n319\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.040\nI went ahead and\nrebooted here in the background.\n\n320\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.970\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's see now that I've turned\n\n321\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.740\non the Wi-Fi adapter again\nif I can connect back to it.\n\n322\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.860\nHopefully we can here in a second,\nwe'll see.\n\n323\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.900\nAnd there it goes, right.\n\n324\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.630\nSo we are connected again.\n\n325\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:33.120\nThere are quite a few reasons you can see\nwhy you might not be able to do something\n\n326\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.240\nlike broadcast to an external monitor.\n\n327\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.950\nOr you might have zero\nwireless connectivity.\n\n328\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.830\nIn fact, that keeps crashing on me.\n\n329\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.862\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust leave the Android off for\n\n330\n00:15:44.862 --> 00:15:49.905\njust a bit, and\nwe'll continue working with iOS.\n\n331\n00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:50.433\nAll right, so\n\n332\n00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:53.410\nthe next thing that we have to worry\nabout is no Bluetooth connectivity.\n\n333\n00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.408\nNow again, Bluetooth connectivity could be\nanother one of those where it's just as\n\n334\n00:15:57.408 --> 00:15:59.785\nsimple as A disabled blue tooth setting,\nright?\n\n335\n00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:02.483\nWhen we talk about a disabled\nBluetooth setting,\n\n336\n00:16:02.483 --> 00:16:06.273\nit could be something like something\nas simple as the fact that again,\n\n337\n00:16:06.273 --> 00:16:08.601\nyou're using one of those quick buttons.\n\n338\n00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:13.145\nRight click launch buttons, and\nwhat ends up happening is you go to\n\n339\n00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:17.866\nturn something on, you go to increase\nthe brightness on the screen.\n\n340\n00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:21.065\nYou swipe down or swipe up,\ndepending on whether you're an android,\n\n341\n00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:22.434\nwhether you're an iOS here.\n\n342\n00:16:22.434 --> 00:16:27.030\nAnd instead of increasing the brightness\non the screen or decreasing, dimming\n\n343\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.910\nthe screen, you end up hitting a button\nthat actually turns off Bluetooth, right?\n\n344\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.950\nSo for instance here on our screen,\nif I swipe up from the bottom.\n\n345\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.014\nAgain, let me try that again.\n\n346\n00:16:39.014 --> 00:16:41.440\nWe get the little Bluetooth signal, right?\n\n347\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.277\nAnd the Bluetooth signal again, shows me\nthat Bluetooth is disabled on this device.\n\n348\n00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:49.419\nBut it's just as simple as\nto hitting the button and\n\n349\n00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:52.260\nyou can see it changes to Bluetooth on.\n\n350\n00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.330\nBut there again,\n\n351\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.120\nif I'm going to do something like\ndimming the screen like I just did.\n\n352\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.565\nAnd I end up hitting either in this case,\nI just hit the wireless, so\n\n353\n00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:01.855\nI'll probably-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:02.752\n&gt;&gt; Have to boot that again.\n\n355\n00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:04.770\nI end up turning off Bluetooth.\n\n356\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.080\nWell now, I no longer have\na connection to the device.\n\n357\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.780\nLet me go ahead and\nreboot that for a second here.\n\n358\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.817\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nsee if we can get back into the device.\n\n359\n00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:18.439\n&gt;&gt; Again, a good prime example of-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n360\n00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:19.429\n&gt;&gt; How easy it is to do this,\n\n361\n00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:20.722\nyou can accidentally-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n362\n00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:22.245\n&gt;&gt; Click on something, love touch screens.\n\n363\n00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:23.286\nThey're amazing-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n364\n00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:24.725\n&gt;&gt; But they definitely have their cons.\n\n365\n00:17:24.725 --> 00:17:26.614\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, and for\n\n366\n00:17:26.614 --> 00:17:28.705\nyou guys out there that are in A+.\n\n367\n00:17:28.705 --> 00:17:33.570\nAnd well I would say for me who teaching\nyou this stuff it might seem simple.\n\n368\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.254\nIt's simple to mess up as well, but for\nsomebody that doesn't understand these\n\n369\n00:17:37.254 --> 00:17:40.085\nsettings, maybe they don't\nread the user manuals, right?\n\n370\n00:17:40.085 --> 00:17:43.420\nMaybe they just I can figure out,\nflip my way through it.\n\n371\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.811\nOr maybe you're supporting somebody\nthat maybe the older generation.\n\n372\n00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:50.886\nI'm certainly not picking on anybody,\nmaybe you need to let them know, hey,\n\n373\n00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:54.180\nthat was your issue, all it was\nwas just as simple as a setting.\n\n374\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.148\n&gt;&gt; I'll give you a prime example,\nmy dad has two Facebook accounts,\n\n375\n00:17:57.148 --> 00:18:00.074\nbecause he thinks he needs to have one for\neach one of his devices.\n\n376\n00:18:00.074 --> 00:18:04.345\nSo it's not his fault that he doesn't\nrealize that what a cloud service is, and\n\n377\n00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:07.935\nthat it's everywhere as long as\nyou have Internet connectivity.\n\n378\n00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:12.328\nHe thinks I have a app, I install it on\nmy device and that's where that works.\n\n379\n00:18:12.328 --> 00:18:16.683\nIf I want it on the other device, I've\ngotta install it and create an account and\n\n380\n00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:20.789\ndo the whole thing and you think it's\ncontained within the device itself.\n\n381\n00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:24.437\nSo that is something you're definitely\ngonna have to deal with as Wes said,\n\n382\n00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:28.427\nsometimes you're dealing with people that\naren't as familiar with technology as\n\n383\n00:18:28.427 --> 00:18:28.954\nwe maybe.\n\n384\n00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:30.363\nSo you gotta be prepared for that.\n\n385\n00:18:30.363 --> 00:18:32.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know that's\nwhere your professionalism and\n\n386\n00:18:32.748 --> 00:18:34.280\ncommunications skills come into it.\n\n387\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.745\nJust don't assume, right?\n\n388\n00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:37.548\nAnd don't take it for granted, and\n\n389\n00:18:37.548 --> 00:18:40.506\ndon't downplay whatever the end\nusers problem might be.\n\n390\n00:18:40.506 --> 00:18:45.015\nBecause you could have seen it a hundred\ntimes, but it might be the first time that\n\n391\n00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:47.819\nthat person has seen\nwhatever the issue might be.\n\n392\n00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:49.586\nAnd it might be very serious to them,\nright?\n\n393\n00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:51.694\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n394\n00:18:51.694 --> 00:18:53.148\nNow that I've got everything.\n\n395\n00:18:53.148 --> 00:18:57.940\nI kinda rebooted here with the Samsung or\nin this case the Android device.\n\n396\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.428\nLet me show you here too.\n\n397\n00:18:59.428 --> 00:19:02.466\nInside of the Android\ndevice up there at the top.\n\n398\n00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:05.148\nLet me go ahead and\nswipe some of this stuff off of there.\n\n399\n00:19:05.148 --> 00:19:09.530\nNotice that we also have that Bluetooth\nbutton there that we can accidentally hit,\n\n400\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.547\nand it could disable your Bluetooth.\n\n401\n00:19:11.547 --> 00:19:14.346\nNow some of the other things in Bluetooth\nreally could be that the device is\n\n402\n00:19:14.346 --> 00:19:14.851\nnot paired.\n\n403\n00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:18.631\nIn fact, Anne and I were talking about\nthis before we started this, and\n\n404\n00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:22.227\nyou mentioned this one,\nis the fact that the device isn't paired.\n\n405\n00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:25.179\nIt could be the fact that\nmaybe the device is paired and\n\n406\n00:19:25.179 --> 00:19:28.930\nwhatever the other device might be\nit might not be charged, right?\n\n407\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.840\nI have wireless earbuds, right?\n\n408\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.530\nAnd they're Bluetooth,\nmore specifically Bluetooth earbuds and\n\n409\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.217\nif they don't have any power.\n\n410\n00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.213\nWell guess what?\n\n411\n00:19:37.213 --> 00:19:38.023\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n412\n00:19:38.023 --> 00:19:38.897\n&gt;&gt; They don't work to well do they.\n\n413\n00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:39.459\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n414\n00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:40.672\nexactly, it doesn't\nmatter if they're paired.\n\n415\n00:19:40.672 --> 00:19:42.109\n&gt;&gt; I had to tell this to a user one time.\n\n416\n00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:45.022\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Electrical devices use electricity.\n\n417\n00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:45.959\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:47.414\n&gt;&gt; That's how they work, so\n\n419\n00:19:47.414 --> 00:19:49.670\nif there's no electricity it no worky.\n\n420\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n421\n00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:53.961\nThe other thing too that you\nsometimes you have to worry about and\n\n422\n00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:55.969\nwe've kind of showed our past episodes.\n\n423\n00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:58.259\nAs when you are pairing\nyour devices together,\n\n424\n00:19:58.259 --> 00:20:00.843\nyou have a security code that\nyou might have to enter.\n\n425\n00:20:00.843 --> 00:20:04.501\nSometimes it could just be a verification\nthat says hey, you're pairing a device\n\n426\n00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:07.692\nmake sure this code matches on\nthe device that you're pairing within.\n\n427\n00:20:07.692 --> 00:20:10.952\nAnd if it is a different code,\nyou just close it down, right?\n\n428\n00:20:10.952 --> 00:20:13.824\nBut sometimes you could have\nthe manually enter a code.\n\n429\n00:20:13.824 --> 00:20:16.905\nIt could be something simple as 000 or\n0000-\n\n430\n00:20:16.905 --> 00:20:18.205\n&gt;&gt; 0000, yeah.\n\n431\n00:20:18.205 --> 00:20:20.527\n&gt;&gt; And\nmake sure you get all the zeros right, and\n\n432\n00:20:20.527 --> 00:20:23.535\nit allows them to enter that\ntrust relationship, right?\n\n433\n00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:26.634\nBut there again,\nit really depends on the device.\n\n434\n00:20:26.634 --> 00:20:30.310\nNow it also, that PIN,\nif you don't enter it right,\n\n435\n00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.590\njust turn the devices off and\nturn them back on.\n\n436\n00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.839\nAnd then go over through\nthe process again.\n\n437\n00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:37.631\nAll right,\n\n438\n00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:42.635\nnow we did kind of mention can't\nbroadcast to external monitors, right?\n\n439\n00:20:42.635 --> 00:20:47.060\nAnd one of the things that it can\nbroadcast to external monitors,\n\n440\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.173\nI showed you was airplane mode,\ncould be turned on, right?\n\n441\n00:20:51.173 --> 00:20:54.164\nYou lose the ability to be\nable to broadcast, right?\n\n442\n00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:59.040\nBecause it turns all the radios off, might\nas well say that by association if Wi-Fi\n\n443\n00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.237\nis turned off or disabled,\nI can't broadcast to an external monitor.\n\n444\n00:21:03.237 --> 00:21:06.390\nNow be careful with this one\nbecause there's also cable\n\n445\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.560\nconnections that I've thrown in this list.\n\n446\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.597\nAnd with cable connections, you have to\nmake sure that the setting on the device\n\n447\n00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:17.042\nthat you're connected to is set right,\nmaybe the source could be.\n\n448\n00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:21.195\nThe other thing that you have to\nworry about is things like HDMI.\n\n449\n00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:23.700\nNow you might say, well wait a second,\nwhat's the problem with HDMI?\n\n450\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.990\nWell HDMI has built into the protocol\nsomething known as HDCP,\n\n451\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.500\nif I get this acronym right,\nI always forget this one.\n\n452\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.890\nAnd that's HD, so\nhigh definition for HDMI,\n\n453\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:39.400\nhigh definition copyright protection,\nall right?\n\n454\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.568\nAnd built into that cable,\nand built into the device.\n\n455\n00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:46.296\nAnd you have to worry about this\nwith things like iOS, right?\n\n456\n00:21:46.296 --> 00:21:52.878\nSo some people were complaining because\nthey bought a movie in Netflix, right?\n\n457\n00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:54.719\nOr they have Netflix, and\n\n458\n00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:59.490\nwhy can't they just hook their iPad\nup to an HDMI splitter or HDMI and\n\n459\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.108\nrun it out to their television and\nbroadcast it over television.\n\n460\n00:22:04.108 --> 00:22:08.663\nWell that's because iOS honors\nthe high-definition content or\n\n461\n00:22:08.663 --> 00:22:10.410\ncopyright protection.\n\n462\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.481\n&gt;&gt; Big Brother is watching.\n\n463\n00:22:11.481 --> 00:22:12.095\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right.\n\n464\n00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:12.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n465\n00:22:12.803 --> 00:22:14.439\njust because we don't think they are-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n466\n00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:15.183\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't mean they're not, right?\n\n467\n00:22:15.183 --> 00:22:15.833\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n468\n00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:16.922\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:22:16.922 --> 00:22:18.052\n&gt;&gt; So tin foil hats.\n\n470\n00:22:18.052 --> 00:22:19.245\n&gt;&gt; It's 1984 baby.\n\n471\n00:22:19.245 --> 00:22:21.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n472\n00:22:21.023 --> 00:22:23.089\nSo it could be something like that, right?\n\n473\n00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:24.670\nIt could be a security setting, right?\n\n474\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.240\nAnd there's nothing you can really do and\n\n475\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.450\nI'm not advocating finding ways to\nget around copyright protection.\n\n476\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.940\nThat's not what we're advocating, but\nit could be something as simple as that,\n\n477\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.600\nit could be a security issue.\n\n478\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.189\nThe other thing that I also wanna do and\nthis is something I kind of show you.\n\n479\n00:22:38.189 --> 00:22:40.732\nAnd I've kinda shown you\nhere in the iOS as well.\n\n480\n00:22:40.732 --> 00:22:44.929\niOS is broadcasting there is\nto the AirPlay software is\n\n481\n00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:49.684\nessentially their type of oop,\nI can't see it, there we go.\n\n482\n00:22:49.684 --> 00:22:53.573\nAirPlay not AirSharing, but I'm sorry,\nI keeps on saying AirSharing.\n\n483\n00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:58.141\nAirPlay is there broadcasting\nover wireless communication.\n\n484\n00:22:58.141 --> 00:23:02.580\nWell you also have that inside\nof your Android device too.\n\n485\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.560\nOne of the easiest ways to see this is\nactually, let me get out of here and\n\n486\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.360\ngo to Settings.\n\n487\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.831\nIf you go to Settings and\nyou bring up Wi-Fi,\n\n488\n00:23:09.831 --> 00:23:12.964\nunderstand that sometimes it\nmight be vendor specific.\n\n489\n00:23:12.964 --> 00:23:16.247\nAnd that's just because Samsung\ndoes things a little bit different\n\n490\n00:23:16.247 --> 00:23:17.694\nthan maybe Google and stuff.\n\n491\n00:23:17.694 --> 00:23:19.583\nAnd I know that Google with their Pixel,\n\n492\n00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:21.872\ntheir settings might be\na little bit different.\n\n493\n00:23:21.872 --> 00:23:27.436\nBut for instance notice that down here at\nthe bottom I have Wi-Fi Direct, right?\n\n494\n00:23:27.436 --> 00:23:31.942\nAnd if I select Wi-Fi Direct,\nnotice it says stop.\n\n495\n00:23:31.942 --> 00:23:32.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n496\n00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:37.478\n&gt;&gt; Well that might be a good indication\nas to what Wi-Fi Direct isn't allowing\n\n497\n00:23:37.478 --> 00:23:40.122\nyou to broadcast to an external monitor.\n\n498\n00:23:40.122 --> 00:23:43.400\nSo again,\na lot of times it's just setting issues.\n\n499\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.775\nIt could be a cabling issue if you're\ntalking about directly tethering\n\n500\n00:23:46.775 --> 00:23:47.968\nto an external monitor.\n\n501\n00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.108\nBut for the most part,\n\n502\n00:23:49.108 --> 00:23:52.721\nthese are just some of the basic\nsettings that you should be looking at.\n\n503\n00:23:52.721 --> 00:23:56.264\nNow Dan, I know I'm looking at this list\nhere and I'm looking at our time, but\n\n504\n00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:59.452\nI think it's gonna be time to we'll\ninsert the comma in this episode.\n\n505\n00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:00.811\n&gt;&gt; I like the way you put that,\nmy good man.\n\n506\n00:24:00.811 --> 00:24:03.758\nAnd he said exactly right, we're\na little short on time for this episode.\n\n507\n00:24:03.758 --> 00:24:06.103\nBut we've got plenty more information or\n\n508\n00:24:06.103 --> 00:24:10.500\nwalk through this as far as common OS\nissues and mobile devices, that is.\n\n509\n00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.458\nSo definitely join us back for\nthat part two.\n\n510\n00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:13.258\nWes will see you there.\n\n511\n00:24:13.258 --> 00:24:14.323\nI know he will.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n512\n00:24:14.323 --> 00:24:17.727\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you guys enjoyed this\nepisode, but it's time for a sign-off for\n\n513\n00:24:17.727 --> 00:24:18.321\nITPro.TV.\n\n514\n00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:19.445\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n515\n00:24:19.445 -->

00:00:10.972\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:13.334\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:16.884\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.543\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie\nin today's episode.\n\n7\n00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:21.530\nWell, we're coming back at you\nwith more on our A+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.030\nActually, we're continuing on\nwith our mobile OS issues.\n\n9\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.380\nAnd joining us back from studio\nto continue that conversation,\n\n10\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.910\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.260\nWes, welcome back sir, how is it going?.\n\n12\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.970\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.400\nThat's right,\nwe are working on a part two.\n\n14\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.530\nAnd just moving through the list.\n\n15\n00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.260\nKeep in mind in the first part we talked\nabout really a lot of connection issues.\n\n16\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.970\nWell, I guess not all connection issues.\n\n17\n00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.080\nDim display and some of things\nthat you had to worry about that.\n\n18\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.050\nWe looked at no wireless signal versus\nintermittent wireless signal and\n\n19\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.550\nwe ended up talking about\nBlue Tooth as well.\n\n20\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.480\nKeep in mind one of the things\nI can't remember if I\n\n21\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.240\nmentioned in the first part about\nbluetooth, one of the additional things.\n\n22\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.116\nRemember that when you turn airplane\nmode on It disables all the wireless\n\n23\n00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:05.141\nsignals, right?\n\n24\n00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:07.658\nWhatever your wireless communication is,\nWiFi, cellular, and Bluetooth.\n\n25\n00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:10.854\nSo I can't remember if I said that one,\nI probably did,\n\n26\n00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:14.395\njust in case I didn't I wanna go ahead and\ndo that one with you.\n\n27\n00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:14.895\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n28\n00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:15.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:15.993\n&gt;&gt; Better safe than sorry,\n\n30\n00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:16.779\nright West?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:17.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,that's right.\n\n32\n00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:18.161\nMight as well get\n\n33\n00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.640\nall of our bases covered.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n34\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.730\nSo moving into the next one,\n\n35\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.800\nwe're gonna talk about well,\ntouchscreen nonresponsive, all right?\n\n36\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.740\nNow, there could be a few things that\n\n37\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.800\ncaused this.\nNow, it could be a damaged device.\n\n38\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.840\nWe really can't overlook that.\n\n39\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.810\nBut touchscreen could be nonresponsive for\n\n40\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.500\na few reasons It's one of\nthe most common reasons.\n\n41\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.780\nIt could be the fact that\nthe device is just turned off.\n\n42\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.090\nDon't overlook that fact that could be.\n\n43\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.559\nCould be the fact that\nyou're at the lock screen.\n\n44\n00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.499\nSo for instance,\nif you know on my screen here,\n\n45\n00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.890\nlet me see I don't know if lock\nscreen will actually show.\n\n46\n00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.154\nLet's see if I can get the lock screen.\n\n47\n00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:56.270\nWhere's my volume across the to here,\nthat's the button am looking for.\n\n48\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.810\nWe see if it will actually show.\n\n49\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.600\nI don't know.\n\n50\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.770\nYep there it is.\n\n51\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay it show it, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.050\n&gt;&gt; So notice that I can't really interact\nwith this screen at all until I end up\n\n53\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.110\nputting in the code, right.\n\n54\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.320\nSo that could be one and\nI know that's kinda basic.\n\n55\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.430\nI do understand that but\n\n56\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.490\nagain remember you never know who\nit is that you might be helping.\n\n57\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.390\nThat could be one of the reasons\nthat you are having a problem.\n\n58\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.370\nNow, it also could be the fact that you\nhave an operating system has locked up.\n\n59\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.770\nThat happens, it happens sometimes where\nan application causes a problem, maybe\n\n60\n00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.860\nthere's a Driver if you will inside of the\noperating system that hangs if you will.\n\n61\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.860\nAnd the operating system itself a lot.\n\n62\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.190\n&gt;&gt; I actually had this trouble\ntwo nights ago, I think.\n\n63\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.944\nIt was Saturday night.\n\n64\n00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:46.456\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:02:46.456 --> 00:02:47.532\nI pulled out my phone.\n\n66\n00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.577\nI take a look at it.\n\n67\n00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:51.070\nIt's, that time is off.\n\n68\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.050\nWhy is that?\n\n69\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.970\nThe screen is locked up.\n\n70\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.870\nLet me just reboot the device.\n\n71\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.840\nActually, had to do a hard reboot\nbecause it was completely unresponsive.\n\n72\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.941\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you know what,\nthat's what I always call it to.\n\n73\n00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:04.521\nLet's go ahead and lets stick on that\nline of thinking there for a second,\n\n74\n00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:07.840\nbecause they call out what's known\nas a soft reset and a hard reset.\n\n75\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.810\nUnlike Dan, I call it a hard\nreboot software boot and so,\n\n76\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.400\nthe jargon here is they call that on the\nobjectives a hard reset, and a soft reset.\n\n77\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.110\nIt's rebooting your operating system.\n\n78\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.270\nThat's what it boils down to.\n\n79\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.060\nRight.\n\n80\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.760\nI want you to think of a soft reboot\nwhen we talk about a self reboot,\n\n81\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.020\nwhat we are talking about is, imagine\nin your desktop operating system down,\n\n82\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.270\nimagine that I go over\nthe window start button, right?\n\n83\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.050\nActually let's get to take a look here,\nI'm in my operating system and\n\n84\n00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.130\nI decide that I'm going to restart\nmy operating system right here.\n\n85\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.540\nThat would be considered a soft restart.\n\n86\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.040\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n87\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Just like you said and\n\n88\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.820\nagain these are the terms that I'm used to\nbecause a lot of times I deal with client\n\n89\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.780\noperating systems.\nHowever, if I get some kind of lock here,\n\n90\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.710\nand nothing I can't interact with\nthe interface, I have to reach over and\n\n91\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.800\nI actually have to press,\nI'm not going to do this,\n\n92\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.830\nI have to press the power button and\nI have to hold it in for a certain time.\n\n93\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.400\nAnd it does the ungraceful\nshut down right?\n\n94\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.780\nOne does a graceful shut down,\none forces a shut down.\n\n95\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.780\nWell, the same thing can happen inside\nof your operating systems here.\n\n96\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.170\nYour mobile operating systems.\n\n97\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.670\nRight?\n\n98\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.490\nSo how do you tell which\none's the difference?\n\n99\n00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.530\nRight?\nLet me show you right?\n\n100\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.720\nSo if I was to go into, for\ninstance my Android device and\n\n101\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.940\nhold in the lock button, right?\n\n102\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.610\nNotice that I have the power off.\n\n103\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.740\nNow, I'm not going to power this one off,\nbut if I push that button,\n\n104\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.560\nthat would be a soft reboot, right?\n\n105\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.020\nThat would be the soft reset.\n\n106\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.410\nBut sometimes like Dan was mentioning,\nit completely locks up, all right?\n\n107\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.963\nNow, if we can bring kind of like my\nscreen back as myself back as well,\n\n108\n00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:50.458\nI want to show both what we would see\non the screen and you can see kind of\n\n109\n00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:54.410\nwhat I'm doing here in the background\ncuz it don't matter if my hand is here.\n\n110\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.274\nBut if I hold the home key and\nI hold the lock screen and I stay here and\n\n111\n00:04:58.274 --> 00:04:59.378\nhold it a for a bit,\n\n112\n00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:03.587\neventually what's gonna happen is\nthe device itself should realize and\n\n113\n00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:08.486\nyou could see it there it shutdown and the\ndevice realize that something is going on,\n\n114\n00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:13.410\nyou're doing a hard reset or a hard reboot\nlike I like, I still call it as well, too.\n\n115\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.780\nRight, it's an ungraceful shut down.\n\n116\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.430\nAnd what you've done is manually said hey,\n\n117\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.820\nI can't get into it with the operating\nsystem so what I need to do\n\n118\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.770\nis I need to physically reboot this\ndevice, or physically reset it.\n\n119\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.430\nSo that is potential.\n\n120\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.790\nSomething that could happen, right?\n\n121\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.230\nSo that's something that you can\ndo inside of your Android devices,\n\n122\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.010\nyou also have that inside\nof your iOS devices, too.\n\n123\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.990\nUnderstand that it's not\nsomething that is unique to one.\n\n124\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.460\nEvery operating system typically, you have\nsome kind of ability to do this, right?\n\n125\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.920\nBecause when the operating\nsystem loses its ability, Or\n\n126\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.640\nI guess you lose the ability\nto interact with it.\n\n127\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.880\nHow am I going to power cycle the device?\n\n128\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.960\nWell, that's where the hard reset or\nthe hard reboot comes in.\n\n129\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.870\nLet me show you on our iPad over here too.\n\n130\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.670\nIPad, I can do the same thing.\n\n131\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.586\nRight, if I wanna, and it's kinda\nbooting up here in the background,\n\n132\n00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:07.471\nthe Samsung device.\n\n133\n00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.133\nLet's see if I can reconnect to it.\n\n134\n00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:11.550\nLet's see here.\n\n135\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.270\nFind the device.\n\n136\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.970\nI might be able to just reconnect to this\none real quick here, in the background.\n\n137\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.390\nThere we go.\nHopefully, that will allow me to connect.\n\n138\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.660\nWas it, there we go.\n\n139\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.350\nNow if I hold in the home button,\n\n140\n00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.180\nthat little button that's\nright here on the iPad.\n\n141\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.380\nIf I hold in this button,\nnow just hold it for a second.\n\n142\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.140\nThat's not going to work.\n\n143\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.420\nApparently that's not going to work.\n\n144\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.390\nMaybe, it's the top lock button I think.\n\n145\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.090\nIt's been so long since I used my iPad.\n\n146\n00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:40.935\nThere we go.\n\n147\n00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:41.555\nThat's what it is.\n\n148\n00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:42.145\nWrong button.\n\n149\n00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:46.435\nSo it's the actual button, let me show you\nguys, the button that's across the top,\n\n150\n00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:47.785\nit's the little button right here.\n\n151\n00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:53.730\nIf I hold that, notice it gives me\nthe ability to slide the power off, right?\n\n152\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.080\nNow, if I was to slide this off,\nit will restart the iPad.\n\n153\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.830\nThat's a soft reset or a soft reboot.\n\n154\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.360\nHowever, keep in mind that if I don't\nwanna do that, right, and I can.\n\n155\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.930\nI'll go ahead and cancel that If I can't\neven gain access to that, because I\n\n156\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.190\nhave a nonresponsive touch input,\nor a touchscreen, right?\n\n157\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.720\nIt does not respond to me,\nit gives me the ability to go ahead and\n\n158\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.110\nto reboot it here.\n\n159\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.310\nLet me go ahead here, and it looks like\nI'm having a little bit of in issue\n\n160\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.610\nhere in the background with\nthe Samsung device, with\n\n161\n00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.350\nthe android device doesn't like to\nplay nice there on the reboot there.\n\n162\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.550\nLet me try that one more time here,\nsee if we can get connected to it.\n\n163\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.530\nAnd we'll restart that.\n\n164\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.743\nSo that's one of the things that\nwe do have to keep in mind, right,\n\n165\n00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:53.787\nis that you have to do sometimes a soft\nreboot, or a soft reset which is basically\n\n166\n00:07:53.787 --> 00:07:58.871\nlike I said holding the lock, in this case\nit's not the home button like I said.\n\n167\n00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:00.810\nI made a mistake there, it's actually the.\n\n168\n00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.313\nLock button on the iOS device here.\n\n169\n00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:09.329\nAnd if you continue to hold it a little\nbit longer with the home button,\n\n170\n00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:13.890\nboth of those, that's when you\ncan end up doing the hard reset.\n\n171\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.903\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet me see if I can get our Android\n\n172\n00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:23.148\ndevice reconnected here and\nwe will move on.\n\n173\n00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:25.683\nAll right, there we go, perfect.\n\n174\n00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:27.960\nOkay, and\nthat should connecting here in a second.\n\n175\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.489\nAll right, so that's some of the things\nthat we also have to worry about.\n\n176\n00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:32.612\nNow how can we also fix this?\n\n177\n00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:37.014\nAnother way that you can re-fix this is if\nthe touchscreen is unresponsive like that\n\n178\n00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:39.868\nbecause you have a lockout,\ndo exactly what Dan said.\n\n179\n00:08:39.868 --> 00:08:42.746\nReboot, reboot the device or restart,\n\n180\n00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:45.888\nresets if you will a lot\nof times work great.\n\n181\n00:08:45.888 --> 00:08:50.210\nNow sometimes, you have things\nlike applications that won't load.\n\n182\n00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.690\nNow if an application won't load,\nit could very well be the fact that\n\n183\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.610\nwell the application isn't on the device,\nright?\n\n184\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.040\nSometimes the application,\nyou could think that hey, and\n\n185\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.856\nlet me show you something let\nme see if I can find one here.\n\n186\n00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:08.122\nOkay, here's one,\nhere's flip board here let me put this on,\n\n187\n00:09:08.122 --> 00:09:10.889\nlet me put this on one\nof the screens here.\n\n188\n00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:14.821\nAnd notice that I have a couple well,\nthis isn't gonna let me remove it,\n\n189\n00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.450\nthis is actually built into the phone.\n\n190\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.386\nNotice that there are some remove,\nthere is a remove option here at the top.\n\n191\n00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:25.260\nAll right,\nremove just takes that off of the screen.\n\n192\n00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.365\nHowever, there's also the ability\nto potentially uninstall.\n\n193\n00:09:30.365 --> 00:09:32.648\nAnd I've actually seen this,\nwhere people will swipe and\n\n194\n00:09:32.648 --> 00:09:35.320\ntry to move that off their screen,\nand they actually uninstall it.\n\n195\n00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.820\nNow you should get a prompt that says,\nsure, you wanna uninstall this?\n\n196\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.089\nBut if you get clicking and\ntouching the screen too quick,\n\n197\n00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:45.373\nthat could completely uninstall\nthe device, all right?\n\n198\n00:09:45.373 --> 00:09:47.450\nSo keep that in mind as well.\n\n199\n00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.500\nThat could be the reason that\nan application isn't loading.\n\n200\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.152\nThe other thing that could be,\nthe application could be corrupt,\n\n201\n00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:55.989\nthat could be causing a problem.\n\n202\n00:09:55.989 --> 00:09:58.498\nAll right,\nnow it could be a resource exhaustion.\n\n203\n00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:02.077\nNow I will tell you these apps are really,\n\n204\n00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:07.395\nreally good that when it comes\nto basically maintaining their\n\n205\n00:10:07.395 --> 00:10:12.423\nresource allocation,\nthe operating system if you will.\n\n206\n00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:15.952\nSometimes what you might need to do,\nyou might need to force stop,\n\n207\n00:10:15.952 --> 00:10:20.190\nsome of your applications or force kill\ndepending on how you are talking about.\n\n208\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.522\nSo I know my head is kind of covered up\nhere, but if I hold the home key in, and\n\n209\n00:10:24.522 --> 00:10:25.405\nyou know what?\n\n210\n00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:27.947\nBecause of the reboot,\nI don't have any applications open.\n\n211\n00:10:27.947 --> 00:10:33.363\nSo let me go ahead, let me do that,\nI'm gonna open up some applications here,\n\n212\n00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:35.842\nwe'll get settings open, right?\n\n213\n00:10:35.842 --> 00:10:40.703\nAnd what can happen sometimes is you can\nget maybe certain applications don't load\n\n214\n00:10:40.703 --> 00:10:42.445\nor they load slowly, right?\n\n215\n00:10:42.445 --> 00:10:44.291\nSlow performance can happen,\n\n216\n00:10:44.291 --> 00:10:47.770\nwhile you can hold the Home\nkey in both operative systems.\n\n217\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.643\nAndroid operating system and iOS,\n\n218\n00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:53.460\nyou can see that I've got a few\nof these applications open.\n\n219\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.131\nWell one of the things that you can do\nis you can force stop or force kill.\n\n220\n00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:59.377\nAgain it all depends on what the context\nis of the operating system, sometimes,\n\n221\n00:10:59.377 --> 00:11:01.280\nthey call it a little bit different.\n\n222\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.040\nAnd you'll notice that in this case,\nI can do this one at a time.\n\n223\n00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.630\nAnd I'll show you in the iOS,\nhow you can do it one at a time as well or\n\n224\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.040\nI could kill all of these at one time.\n\n225\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.117\nNotice that, now when I hold the home\nkey down, it says no recent apps.\n\n226\n00:11:15.117 --> 00:11:18.693\nBecause what you have is your applications\ngo into kind of a passive mode, but\n\n227\n00:11:18.693 --> 00:11:22.020\nthey're still using and\nconsuming some of your resources.\n\n228\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.189\nSo that's one of the things that you can\ndo as well, is that if an application\n\n229\n00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:30.769\nhappens to not be loading because maybe\nyou don't have any more memory available.\n\n230\n00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:33.476\nJust close some other applications\nthat are running in the background.\n\n231\n00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:35.881\n&gt;&gt; It's weird,\nit's kind of a fine line too,\n\n232\n00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:39.327\nbecause if you close all your\napplications, then you have to,\n\n233\n00:11:39.327 --> 00:11:42.523\nit takes a little time to load\nback up if you wanna reuse it.\n\n234\n00:11:42.523 --> 00:11:46.426\nSo they say, recommend keeping only those\napplications which you know you're gonna\n\n235\n00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.551\nbe using a lot,\nhoping the others go in there.\n\n236\n00:11:48.551 --> 00:11:52.421\nLook through the list, force close the\nones you're not gonna be using very much.\n\n237\n00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:54.639\nBecause they're just taking\nup resources at that point.\n\n238\n00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:55.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan, so\n\n239\n00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:58.919\njust like we said, you have too many of\nthese applications going at one time.\n\n240\n00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:02.339\nA lot of times it's really more\ngraphics intensive applications,\n\n241\n00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:04.919\ncuz I mean let's face it,\nmodern mobile devices,\n\n242\n00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:07.988\nthey're more powerful than\nmany of our earlier computers.\n\n243\n00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:09.534\nAnd heck, even my desktop at home,\n\n244\n00:12:09.534 --> 00:12:11.865\nyou might see that mobile\ndevices are more powerful.\n\n245\n00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.386\nSo just kill them all,\nwhen it comes down to the application,\n\n246\n00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:15.850\nwell it sounds like I just got into.\n\n247\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.867\n&gt;&gt; Kill them all.\n\n248\n00:12:16.867 --> 00:12:18.195\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go listen to some\n\n249\n00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.498\nheavy metal Dan and I, right?\n\n250\n00:12:19.498 --> 00:12:20.044\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n251\n00:12:20.044 --> 00:12:22.705\n&gt;&gt; So\njust force kill those applications and\n\n252\n00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:26.512\nthen relaunch the application\nif it becomes problematic.\n\n253\n00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.542\nSome of the other things\nthat they mention, and\n\n254\n00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:30.693\nthis one might be something\nyou have to deal with.\n\n255\n00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:32.668\nA lot of times, more than anything,\n\n256\n00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:36.879\nyou'll have to deal with this if you're\nin an enterprise environment dealing\n\n257\n00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.960\nwith something like exchange,\nmail server if you will.\n\n258\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.972\nThey talk about unable to decrypt email.\n\n259\n00:12:42.972 --> 00:12:46.042\nNow I'm not saying that you couldn't\ndo this from a home environment or\n\n260\n00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:48.150\neven a small office,\nhome office environment.\n\n261\n00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.127\nMore often than not,\nif we're talking about things like S/MIME,\n\n262\n00:12:52.127 --> 00:12:54.658\nSecure Multimedia Internet Extensions.\n\n263\n00:12:54.658 --> 00:12:58.928\nA lot of times where talking about is\nyou have a corporate email server and\n\n264\n00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:01.589\nyou're sending emails between each other.\n\n265\n00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:04.502\nAnd that's all tied to\npublic key cryptology and\n\n266\n00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:06.855\nreally deals with risk certificates.\n\n267\n00:13:06.855 --> 00:13:09.873\nAnd sometimes there could be\na certificate mismatch or\n\n268\n00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:11.780\na corruption of the certificate.\n\n269\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.519\nProblems with this\ncertificate in general and\n\n270\n00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.666\nwhat you have to do a couple of\nthings you might have to do.\n\n271\n00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:18.576\nIn fact, let me show you one of the things\nthat could be very basic that you\n\n272\n00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:19.407\nmight have to deal.\n\n273\n00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:23.790\nIs you might have to go into your device\nlet me go into the right places for\n\n274\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.822\ninstance Settings, and\nyou'll notice Accounts.\n\n275\n00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:30.303\nAnd one of the things that I might have\nto do is go to the account itself and\n\n276\n00:13:30.303 --> 00:13:32.928\nI might actually have to\ndelete the account, right?\n\n277\n00:13:32.928 --> 00:13:34.507\nSo that's one of the things\nthat you can do.\n\n278\n00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:36.610\nYou delete the account, if you will, and\n\n279\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.050\nthen you go through the process of\nadding the account back, right?\n\n280\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.503\nAnd what happens is that\nsynchronizes the device.\n\n281\n00:13:42.503 --> 00:13:45.336\nEssentially in your account\ninformation with the server, and\n\n282\n00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:46.672\na lot of times what it'll do,\n\n283\n00:13:46.672 --> 00:13:50.910\nis it'll pull down the certificate and now\nwe don't have a certificate mismatched.\n\n284\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.149\nThe other thing that you can also do,\n\n285\n00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:57.348\nsometimes you can just contact\nthe administrator, your help desk.\n\n286\n00:13:57.348 --> 00:14:01.078\nThis might not be anything that you're\ngonna be dealing with, might be something\n\n287\n00:14:01.078 --> 00:14:04.820\nthat you submit a help desk ticket to,\nand you just can't open the email, right?\n\n288\n00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.793\nAnd then what happens is the administrator\nwill just reissue the certificate.\n\n289\n00:14:08.793 --> 00:14:12.580\nThe certificate will probably be snicker\nin some form, maybe even emailed.\n\n290\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.152\nAnd then you reload it\nup into the device and\n\n291\n00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:18.667\nnow we have that certificate\nproperly decrypt the email.\n\n292\n00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:21.433\nAll right, so again,\nthat could be happening,\n\n293\n00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:23.937\njust reimporting the certificate itself.\n\n294\n00:14:23.937 --> 00:14:27.847\nThe other thing that happens a lot on\nmobile devices, remember two of the big\n\n295\n00:14:27.847 --> 00:14:31.899\nthings when it comes to any mobile device\nor small form factor device, right?\n\n296\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.056\nBattery life, right?\n\n297\n00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:37.843\nWe wanna extend the battery life as\nmuch as we can and as much as possible.\n\n298\n00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.060\nThe other thing is proper\nthermal management, right?\n\n299\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.045\nOverheating, we don't have a lot\nof space within this devices.\n\n300\n00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:47.592\nSo those becomes two of\nthe most probable many things.\n\n301\n00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:49.674\nThe big thing with the battery life and\n\n302\n00:14:49.674 --> 00:14:53.656\nthat's one of the things they call\nout as extremely short battery life.\n\n303\n00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:55.374\nThere's a few things here, all right?\n\n304\n00:14:55.374 --> 00:14:57.514\nLet's start from a physical\ndevice standpoint and\n\n305\n00:14:57.514 --> 00:15:00.190\nthen we'll work our way into the software,\nDan.\n\n306\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.900\nPhysical device, right?\n\n307\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.840\nDoes the charger work?\n\n308\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.646\nI've seen the wall works fail, right?\n\n309\n00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:09.620\nA little wall charger that you plug in and\nthat fails, all right?\n\n310\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.160\nHas the cable failed?\n\n311\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.190\nFor whatever reason,\n\n312\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.090\nI tell you what, I can destroy\njust about any piece of hardware.\n\n313\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.378\nYou just ask Dan, ask anybody around here.\n\n314\n00:15:18.378 --> 00:15:19.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will attest.\n\n315\n00:15:19.012 --> 00:15:20.785\nI've never seen anything like it my life.\n\n316\n00:15:20.785 --> 00:15:21.968\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:23.126\n&gt;&gt; My nickname is Galactis, right?\n\n318\n00:15:23.126 --> 00:15:26.222\nI am not just the destroyer of worlds.\n\n319\n00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:28.396\nI'm the destroyer of all\ncomputer components.\n\n320\n00:15:28.396 --> 00:15:29.244\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it will die.\n\n321\n00:15:29.244 --> 00:15:29.972\n&gt;&gt; But-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:31.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] one of the things\n\n323\n00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:34.202\nthat we have to worry about,\nand I've had to worry about,\n\n324\n00:15:34.202 --> 00:15:38.330\nis through just using the phone,\nyou'll notice that the phone kinda breaks.\n\n325\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.700\nIf you've ever had a wire for\ninstance, and that wire,\n\n326\n00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.941\nyou just kinda snap that wire back and\nforth, right?\n\n327\n00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:46.579\nWhat do you do?\nYou can break the wire.\n\n328\n00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:47.343\nWell guess what?\n\n329\n00:15:47.343 --> 00:15:48.694\nYou've got wires running\nthrough that cable.\n\n330\n00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:54.169\nAnd if it just keeps bending back and\nforth, eventually it is gonna break.\n\n331\n00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:59.010\nSo again a charger and cable attached\nto the charge could be a problem.\n\n332\n00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.652\nThe other thing that could be problem,\nI mean, when you come down to it,\n\n333\n00:16:02.652 --> 00:16:04.280\nis the battery itself, right?\n\n334\n00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.940\nIs the battery,\nhas the battery failed, right?\n\n335\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.240\nBatteries have a certain life span,\nall right?\n\n336\n00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.700\nNow, I am not only talking\nabout charging capacity here,\n\n337\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.470\nthey could exceed their life span, right?\n\n338\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.760\nAnd you might start seeing\na diminished charge,\n\n339\n00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.910\nthat could be extremely\nshort battery life.\n\n340\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:29.010\nAgain, that's really something that\nyou'll have to look at the warranty and\n\n341\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.440\nwhat the manufacturer's recommendation\nis to the device itself, all right?\n\n342\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.709\nThe other thing that I want you to\nalso keep in mind is that sometimes\n\n343\n00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:40.837\nthe battery's replaceable,\nsometimes it is not, all right?\n\n344\n00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:45.151\nNow, the Samsung device that we've been\nshowing you here, the little Galaxy S4,\n\n345\n00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:47.050\nit does have a replaceable battery.\n\n346\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.290\nI'm not sure if yours does, Dan.\n\n347\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.620\nDoes the 8-\n&gt;&gt; Mine does not, yeah.\n\n348\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, yeah, you could see as they've\nmoved in Samsung, mine doesn't either,\n\n349\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.244\nI've got a little\n&gt;&gt; So Samsung is weird, they kind of like\n\n350\n00:16:56.244 --> 00:17:00.674\nbounce back and forth with your ability\nto be able to change the battery or not.\n\n351\n00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:02.290\nI love being able to change the battery.\n\n352\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.730\nI think it's a fantastic option.\n\n353\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.155\nSamsung, if you're listening, right?\n\n354\n00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:07.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I can kill my battery all day,\n\n355\n00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:10.424\npop out, put a fresh one in that's\nbeen sitting on the wall all day,\n\n356\n00:17:10.424 --> 00:17:12.040\nthat's a nice feature.\n\n357\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.730\nApple, if you're listening, Apple devices\ntypically don't allow you [INAUDIBLE]\n\n358\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n359\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.786\nMy pixel doesn't either.\n\n360\n00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.040\nAnd I know your wife-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.170\n&gt;&gt; You said your wife got a Pixel, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she has a Pixel.\n\n362\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.089\n&gt;&gt; We can't change them, right?\n\n363\n00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:25.361\nAnd that might be an actual deal breaker\nwhen it comes, this is mobile issues,\n\n364\n00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:27.258\nthis might be a purchasing issue.\n\n365\n00:17:27.258 --> 00:17:27.864\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n366\n00:17:27.864 --> 00:17:32.270\n&gt;&gt; The reason she didn't want to upgrade\nwas that they'd taken away that ability.\n\n367\n00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.965\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so that might be something\nthat you have to consider when it comes to\n\n368\n00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:39.812\njust basically purchasing the device,\nright?\n\n369\n00:17:39.812 --> 00:17:43.255\nIf you're one of those ones like Dan said,\nand I know I like this as well,\n\n370\n00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:46.925\nbeing able to plug that, have an extra\nbattery so that if you start losing your\n\n371\n00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:49.746\nbattery power, it's okay,\nI just pull the battery out and\n\n372\n00:17:49.746 --> 00:17:53.580\nI'll slap the new one in there and\nstick the second one on the charger.\n\n373\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.550\nThat might be a purchasing\nissue to start with.\n\n374\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.380\nSo, that could be the problem.\n\n375\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.970\nYou might not be able\nto replace the battery.\n\n376\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.180\nYou might have to get a warranty call or\na factory exchange.\n\n377\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.130\nSo, pay attention to\nwhatever the vendor is, too.\n\n378\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.550\nSo, that's a little bit about\nthe hardware side of things.\n\n379\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.054\nThe other thing that could be is the fact\nthat there might be too many applications\n\n380\n00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:14.886\nrunning, right?\n\n381\n00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:19.753\nAnd really when I say that, understand\nthat where you usually get the majority\n\n382\n00:18:19.753 --> 00:18:23.587\nof chewing up the battery, and\nby that I don't mean literally\n\n383\n00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:27.558\nbiting into the battery, just jargon here-\n&gt;&gt; Figuratively [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:18:27.558 --> 00:18:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Draining the battery, is where you have\nvery graphics intensive applications.\n\n385\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.210\nIf you have an application,\na video game open, right?\n\n386\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:40.100\nThese devices are so impressive today\nby their ability to give you a great\n\n387\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.000\ngraphical experience when it comes\nto the GPUs that are in them.\n\n388\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.440\nThat will take your battery and\n\n389\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.180\nthrow it in the trash when it\ncomes to the battery drain.\n\n390\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.850\nSo disable those.\n\n391\n00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.170\nThe other thing that you can do, too,\nis implement power saving techniques.\n\n392\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.480\nI know we do this, and I've already\nkind of mentioned this within this\n\n393\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.955\nmobile issue series that we're doing here.\n\n394\n00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:08.380\nIs like I can kinda just glance over Dan's\nmobile device that's on the desk here,\n\n395\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.410\nand I can see that his\nis in a low power mode.\n\n396\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.530\nAnd that's because, well,\nhe's not currently talking on it.\n\n397\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.280\nSo one of the things that are happening\nis that it's dimming the screen.\n\n398\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.690\nIt could be potentially that you're\nnot using wireless, disable it, right?\n\n399\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.950\nOr maybe you're on the wireless, but\nyou're not using the cellular data.\n\n400\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.070\nDisable the cellular.\n\n401\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.050\nOr you're not using Bluetooth.\n\n402\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.280\nDisable Bluetooth, right?\n\n403\n00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Location services, right?\n\n404\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.415\nThe GPS inside.\n\n405\n00:19:30.415 --> 00:19:33.430\nThere's another radio reaching out,\ntrying to grab something.\n\n406\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.880\nAnd if you are inside of a building,\nwith a lot of or thick coverage and\n\n407\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.650\nyou can't get GPS data,\n\n408\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.140\nwhat it's gonna do is continually try\nto access that, killing the batteries.\n\n409\n00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.370\nThese little things they add up over time.\n\n410\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n411\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.690\nIn fact, you and I were talking\nabout one of the features, again,\n\n412\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.690\nof the Google Pixel, right?\n\n413\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.390\nOne of the things you can have,\nfor instance,\n\n414\n00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.830\nif you have a Google is that you get free\nsynchronization up in the Cloud, right?\n\n415\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.220\nWell, guess what?\n\n416\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.510\nIf you got synchronization technologies\nthat are running in the background,\n\n417\n00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.660\nguess what could be happening?\n\n418\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.300\nYou could be synchronizing your photos up\nto the Cloud, or your files automatically.\n\n419\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.510\nYou don't know that that's happening.\n\n420\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.610\nAnd when that happens, guess what?\n\n421\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.738\nIt's utilizing your information.\n\n422\n00:20:09.738 --> 00:20:11.096\n&gt;&gt; And chewing up your data plan as well.\n\n423\n00:20:11.096 --> 00:20:13.490\n&gt;&gt; It really is, yeah, absolutely.\n\n424\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.162\nAnd that's, again, that's another one of\nthose things that where you could open up\n\n425\n00:20:17.162 --> 00:20:18.700\nyour Application Managers.\n\n426\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.580\nLet me show you.\nIn fact,\n\n427\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.850\nI pulled out the Application Manager.\n\n428\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.780\nLet me show you here.\n\n429\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.990\nSo I'm just going to Settings, right?\n\n430\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.730\nAnd from here, I can go to More.\n\n431\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.440\nAnd notice we got\nthe Application Manager here.\n\n432\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.940\nAgain, this is a great thing to be able\nto do inside of things like Android.\n\n433\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.580\nWith the Application Manager\ninside of iOS devices,\n\n434\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.250\nessentially what you would do is just kill\nany of the applications that are open.\n\n435\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.180\nBut I could go to Application Manager, and\n\n436\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.670\nI can actually see, notice that I can\nsee what the device memory is, right?\n\n437\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.200\nWhat's currently being used\nversus what's free, and\n\n438\n00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.860\nthat could also be slow performance.\n\n439\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.460\nI didn't mention that, but\nyou could see that as well, too.\n\n440\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.550\nAnd I can find, more importantly for\nme, up here at the top,\n\n441\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.540\nif I kinda scroll up to the top,\nthese are downloaded, right?\n\n442\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.010\nSo they might not be running right now, so\n\n443\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.200\nthat might not really be something\nthat I care about, right?\n\n444\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.070\nI don't have an SD,\nexternal SD card in here.\n\n445\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.040\nBut this column I might be considering,\nright?\n\n446\n00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.220\nI got Vysor running, and\n\n447\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.440\nthat's what actually allowing\nus to view this episode, right?\n\n448\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.960\nBut I've got some system\nservices that are running.\n\n449\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.260\nI've got Knox in the background for\nsecurity.\n\n450\n00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:21.880\nLook at this.\n\n451\n00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.050\nStory album is running.\n\n452\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.250\nI don't really care about that, right?\n\n453\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.620\nSo maybe I want to go in there and\nI wanna say, you know what?\n\n454\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.220\nStop.\n\n455\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.188\nNow, I'm not gonna stop this cuz it'd\nbe my luck that it'd also stop Vysor in\n\n456\n00:21:34.188 --> 00:21:35.209\nthe background, right?\n\n457\n00:21:35.209 --> 00:21:37.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that just kinda lends itself to\n\n458\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.760\njust being careful when\nyou're doing force stops.\n\n459\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.680\nBut you can do that, right?\n\n460\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.510\nThere, I wouldn't wanna close\nGoogle Play services here, right?\n\n461\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.750\nCuz there's three processes and\nthree services, so\n\n462\n00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.510\nyou have service dependencies, just like\nyou have whether you're talking about\n\n463\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.310\ninside a Windows operating\nsystem with services running.\n\n464\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.980\nWhether you're talking about Linux\nrunning daemons in the background.\n\n465\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.935\nAgain, so but it could be something\nthat you utilize, all right?\n\n466\n00:22:00.935 --> 00:22:03.954\nSo overheating is another\nthing that can happen.\n\n467\n00:22:03.954 --> 00:22:08.625\nAnd again, overheating I would say some\nof the same things that you have to worry\n\n468\n00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:12.390\nabout when you talk about extreme\nbattery loss, battery life,\n\n469\n00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.638\nis pay attention to direct sunlight.\n\n470\n00:22:14.638 --> 00:22:16.630\nThat's a big one, right?\n\n471\n00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:21.180\nKeep your device environmental location,\nI'm not saying hug the environment here,\n\n472\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.310\nI'm just saying watch where it's located.\n\n473\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.120\nI've told you this before in other\nepisodes where we're talking about\n\n474\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.040\nmobility.\n\n475\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.830\nI was using the GPS system to\nkind of track my location,\n\n476\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.160\nhad it in the passenger seat where the sun\nwas coming in the car, and guess what?\n\n477\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.160\nI got a thermal temperature shutdown.\n\n478\n00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.960\nDevices typically have thermal\nprotection sensors, right?\n\n479\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.570\nWe've showed you in other episodes\nhow I've got one of the sensors is\n\n480\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.240\na temperature sensor and\na humidity sensor.\n\n481\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.520\nIf it detects that the device is too hot,\nit will go into a thermal shutdown.\n\n482\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.610\n&gt;&gt; Which is, like you said,\nfor its protection.\n\n483\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.370\nThat's a good thing, and\n\n484\n00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.360\nso if it's overheating,\nyou want it to do that very thing.\n\n485\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.280\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n486\n00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.950\nScreen dimming is another thing that\nyou might wanna dim the screen if that\n\n487\n00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.210\nhappens.\n\n488\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:06.070\nDisable any intensive, resource intensive,\nexcuse me, applications.\n\n489\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.071\nAny kind of video games.\n\n490\n00:23:09.071 --> 00:23:12.180\nHere's one, actually, on my\nGoogle Pixel that causes me problems.\n\n491\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.810\nBelieve it or not, the Daydream VR,\nthe virtual reality app.\n\n492\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.000\nMan, I'll tell you, Dan, I put that\nthing in the virtual reality goggles or\n\n493\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.240\nwhatever, mask.\n\n494\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.362\nAnd you can almost cook\nan egg on the back of it.\n\n495\n00:23:22.362 --> 00:23:23.130\n&gt;&gt; It heats up.\n\n496\n00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.930\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, the fingerprint\nauthentication scanner on the background,\n\n497\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.255\nit gets warm to the touch.\n\n498\n00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:33.670\nAgain, pay attention cuz when we say\nresource intensive, some of these\n\n499\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.110\napplications take that CPU and they're\nlike hey we're off to the races here,\n\n500\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.895\nbuddy, and\nit's gonna be an NHRA drag race, right?\n\n501\n00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:41.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To the finish line.\n\n502\n00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.250\nFrozen system,\nthat's another one they call out.\n\n503\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.720\nI kinda talked about this\nwhen I said OS Lockout.\n\n504\n00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.860\nSame thing applies here.\n\n505\n00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.447\nIt could be an application that's hung.\n\n506\n00:23:50.447 --> 00:23:52.545\nIt could be an application\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n507\n00:23:52.545 --> 00:23:55.277\nIt could be the actual system\nitself that's causing the problem.\n\n508\n00:23:55.277 --> 00:23:58.132\nIf it happens to be the system\nthat's causing the problem,\n\n509\n00:23:58.132 --> 00:24:00.079\nJust do your normal hard reset, right.\n\n510\n00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:03.223\nIf it happens to be a hard\nreset that you have to do, or\n\n511\n00:24:03.223 --> 00:24:07.873\na hard reboot as they call it, well just\nyou might have to reboot the machine.\n\n512\n00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:12.808\nAnd if that happens well it's one of\nthose things that hey, sometimes power\n\n513\n00:24:12.808 --> 00:24:18.222\ncycling and restarting applications will\nfix a lot, it might be very, very easy.\n\n514\n00:24:18.222 --> 00:24:22.535\nWhat I would say is more than anything,\nbefore you do anything else try to do\n\n515\n00:24:22.535 --> 00:24:27.139\na soft reset, where you do your software\nreset inside of the operating system.\n\n516\n00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:29.635\nAnd then if that doesn't\nwork that's where, well,\n\n517\n00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:31.749\nyou might just have to\nbreak out the big guns.\n\n518\n00:24:31.749 --> 00:24:36.006\nAnd you might actually have\nto hold the lock button and\n\n519\n00:24:36.006 --> 00:24:41.599\nthe home button and do a hard reset or\na hard, excuse me, hard reboot.\n\n520\n00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.347\nI'll get that right eventually there.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n521\n00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:45.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The last couple of things,\n\n522\n00:24:45.187 --> 00:24:47.846\nI know we're running close on time here,\nthat they mentioned,\n\n523\n00:24:47.846 --> 00:24:49.386\nno sound from speakers there, Dan.\n\n524\n00:24:49.386 --> 00:24:51.755\nOne of the things that we can always do.\n\n525\n00:24:51.755 --> 00:24:53.131\n&gt;&gt; You have your finger\nover the speaker hole.\n\n526\n00:24:53.131 --> 00:24:53.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n527\n00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:54.763\nThat actually will work.\n\n528\n00:24:54.763 --> 00:24:55.819\n&gt;&gt; It actually will do.\n\n529\n00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:56.426\n&gt;&gt; Yes it will.\n\n530\n00:24:56.426 --> 00:24:57.174\n&gt;&gt; It will block the sound.\n\n531\n00:24:57.174 --> 00:24:58.550\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely will do that.\n\n532\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.137\nOne of the things that\ncan happen sometimes,\n\n533\n00:25:00.137 --> 00:25:01.483\nif you put your phone on vibrate mode.\n\n534\n00:25:01.483 --> 00:25:02.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n535\n00:25:02.422 --> 00:25:03.606\n&gt;&gt; And in fact, I can show you.\n\n536\n00:25:03.606 --> 00:25:07.585\nIf we look at my screen here,\nand I'll tell you what?\n\n537\n00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:10.198\nLet's see here.\n\n538\n00:25:10.198 --> 00:25:11.634\nThere's our sound, right.\n\n539\n00:25:11.634 --> 00:25:16.715\nSo I can actually turn the sound\nall the way off, right.\n\n540\n00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:21.771\nSimple as adjusting the setting right or\nreconfiguration of the settings.\n\n541\n00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:26.496\nHere inside of our Android device,\nif I turn the volume with the physical\n\n542\n00:25:26.496 --> 00:25:31.072\nvolume keys down, notice that it\ngoes into the vibrate mode, right.\n\n543\n00:25:31.072 --> 00:25:33.312\nAnd that could be something\nthat maybe you're not aware of.\n\n544\n00:25:33.312 --> 00:25:35.979\nThat it's turned all the way off and\nyou can see,\n\n545\n00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:38.400\nreally I could have the setting on, right.\n\n546\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.379\nAnd I could accidentally hit the vibrate\nfrom the soft key right there function\n\n547\n00:25:42.379 --> 00:25:43.292\nwhere its muted.\n\n548\n00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:45.895\nThis could be a problem, likewise too.\n\n549\n00:25:45.895 --> 00:25:49.622\nKeep in mind some of your android devices\nlike we've already showed you in some\n\n550\n00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:50.475\nother episodes.\n\n551\n00:25:50.475 --> 00:25:56.862\nIf you wanna do a test of the speakers,\nsometimes its vendor specific but\n\n552\n00:25:56.862 --> 00:26:02.010\nother times you can get in to,\nlet me get that right there.\n\n553\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.136\nYou can get into the field service menu.\n\n554\n00:26:05.136 --> 00:26:07.272\nAnd inside of the field service menu,\n\n555\n00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:11.423\nit gives you the ability to do things\nlike low-frequency tests, right.\n\n556\n00:26:11.423 --> 00:26:14.100\nAnd we can do, I don't know if\nyou'll hear these, let's see.\n\n557\n00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:17.898\nBarely\n&gt;&gt; Barely hear.\n\n558\n00:26:17.898 --> 00:26:19.593\n&gt;&gt; Just barely hear that right.\n\n559\n00:26:19.593 --> 00:26:23.839\nAnd it allows you to do,\nit allows you to do your sound test right.\n\n560\n00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:25.373\nSpeaker test right here.\n\n561\n00:26:25.373 --> 00:26:29.385\n[MUSIC]\n\n562\n00:26:29.385 --> 00:26:30.804\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting speaker testing.\n\n563\n00:26:30.804 --> 00:26:32.535\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the very interesting speaker test.\n\n564\n00:26:32.535 --> 00:26:34.371\nI would have preferred if\nit was some heavy metal.\n\n565\n00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:36.297\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you can see that shows you right\n\n566\n00:26:36.297 --> 00:26:39.778\nthere that it tests the speakers, and\nit allows you to do in the field,\n\n567\n00:26:39.778 --> 00:26:40.550\nif you need to.\n\n568\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.478\nTo test the speakers,\nand make sure that, hey,\n\n569\n00:26:42.478 --> 00:26:44.699\nmaybe it is a user setting\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n570\n00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:48.454\nMaybe it's an application\nthat's taken over the sound.\n\n571\n00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:49.467\nI'll give you an example.\n\n572\n00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:51.370\nThere's some video games that I've used,\nand\n\n573\n00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.094\nI've been trying to listen to something.\n\n574\n00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:56.998\nTurn the video game on,\nit takes over the sound as it initiates.\n\n575\n00:26:56.998 --> 00:26:59.515\nAnd then it does a hang and a memory leak.\n\n576\n00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:01.292\nAnd it doesn't turn that return,\n\n577\n00:27:01.292 --> 00:27:04.662\nwhat's supposed to happen is when\nyou shut an application down it\n\n578\n00:27:04.662 --> 00:27:08.539\nshould take those resources and\nreturn them back to the operating system.\n\n579\n00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:12.490\nIf it doesn't happen,\nagain force-kill all your applications,\n\n580\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.137\nworst case scenario\njust reboot the device.\n\n581\n00:27:15.137 --> 00:27:17.908\nInaccurate touchscreen responses,\n\n582\n00:27:17.908 --> 00:27:22.242\nyou really can't do too much\nof re-calibration anymore.\n\n583\n00:27:22.242 --> 00:27:26.599\nWe've also shown you in other episodes\nthat same service code menu that I was in\n\n584\n00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:27.202\nearlier.\n\n585\n00:27:27.202 --> 00:27:31.245\nIn fact, if we can go back to my screen\nhere real quick there are a few things\n\n586\n00:27:31.245 --> 00:27:32.822\nthat you might be able to do.\n\n587\n00:27:32.822 --> 00:27:37.057\nYou might be able to do,\nwhere is that, touch screen.\n\n588\n00:27:37.057 --> 00:27:39.735\nAnd again touchscreen this is one of those\n\n589\n00:27:39.735 --> 00:27:42.727\nones that allows you\ntest to see how accurate.\n\n590\n00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:47.358\nI can't draw a straight line to save my\nlife apparently to kinda show you where\n\n591\n00:27:47.358 --> 00:27:48.509\nthe touch screen.\n\n592\n00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:53.597\nAnd if the touch screen is physically\ndamaged in this case this one is not.\n\n593\n00:27:53.597 --> 00:27:57.586\nLike I said, I'm just challenged [LAUGH]\nactually drawing a straight line.\n\n594\n00:27:57.586 --> 00:28:00.317\nAnd it let's me know the touch\nscreen was working just fine.\n\n595\n00:28:00.317 --> 00:28:01.703\nIt was just the operator.\n\n596\n00:28:01.703 --> 00:28:04.423\n[LAUGH] Having a bit of an issue there.\n\n597\n00:28:04.423 --> 00:28:08.504\nThe other thing too that you might\nsee if you get inaccurate or\n\n598\n00:28:08.504 --> 00:28:11.554\ntouch screen response, reboot the device.\n\n599\n00:28:11.554 --> 00:28:15.533\nIt could just be a glitch in the operating\nsystem that's causing the problem more\n\n600\n00:28:15.533 --> 00:28:16.599\nthan anything else.\n\n601\n00:28:16.599 --> 00:28:19.134\nSystem lockout, so\nwe've kind of talked about those.\n\n602\n00:28:19.134 --> 00:28:23.362\nThey kinda all run together, when you\ntalk about OS lockout, system lockout.\n\n603\n00:28:23.362 --> 00:28:24.902\nThe one I will say that,\n\n604\n00:28:24.902 --> 00:28:29.297\nwhen it comes to a system lockout\nis it might be security-related.\n\n605\n00:28:29.297 --> 00:28:33.333\nAnd we've got a security episode coming\nup, so I'll just briefly mention this.\n\n606\n00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:37.119\nIf you enter your password wrong\ntoo many times, guess what?\n\n607\n00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:38.666\nYou get a system lockout.\n\n608\n00:28:38.666 --> 00:28:43.388\nMost of your newer devices that have\nfingerprint authentication have what's\n\n609\n00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:46.035\ncalled anti hammering attack protection,\n\n610\n00:28:46.035 --> 00:28:49.479\nanti hammering essentially\nis what that means, right?\n\n611\n00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:50.301\nAnd think about it, right?\n\n612\n00:28:50.301 --> 00:28:54.663\nWhat do I do when I'm doing biometrics\nauthentication with fingerprint scanner?\n\n613\n00:28:54.663 --> 00:28:56.413\nI'm pressing the finger prints in.\n\n614\n00:28:56.413 --> 00:28:58.941\nWell, I have what's known\nas hammering attack.\n\n615\n00:28:58.941 --> 00:29:03.185\nPress it, press it, press it until\neventually you're trying to get you're\n\n616\n00:29:03.185 --> 00:29:06.385\ntrying to get that authentication\nscreen either wig out or\n\n617\n00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:08.882\nyou know just trying to\nbypass the security.\n\n618\n00:29:08.882 --> 00:29:11.539\nWell, this newer devices\nhave anti-hammering.\n\n619\n00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:14.706\nThat's called anti-hammering\nprotection which means two or\n\n620\n00:29:14.706 --> 00:29:16.622\nthree of these inaccurate accounts.\n\n621\n00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:19.731\nAnd it says that it flips over to the pin,\nyou answer the pin wrong, and\n\n622\n00:29:19.731 --> 00:29:20.862\nnow you're locked out.\n\n623\n00:29:20.862 --> 00:29:25.533\nSo it just prevents from things\nlike brute force attacks too.\n\n624\n00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:29.505\nIf that does happen, sometimes it's\njust a matter of waiting a few minutes,\n\n625\n00:29:29.505 --> 00:29:33.372\nthat's all you have got to do, just\nwait a few minutes and it will reset it.\n\n626\n00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:36.883\nSometimes if it is very strict you might\nhave to take it to the administrator.\n\n627\n00:29:36.883 --> 00:29:41.632\nWorst case scenario a lot of you could\nhave to connect to via a completely\n\n628\n00:29:41.632 --> 00:29:46.395\nseparate device like your laptop or\nyour workstation via web browser.\n\n629\n00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:49.196\nConnect to a Cloud based service\nwhere you log in there and\n\n630\n00:29:49.196 --> 00:29:51.131\nverify that you are who you say you are.\n\n631\n00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:54.581\nAnd it will send a command out\nto the operating system so\n\n632\n00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:56.309\nthat it will reset itself.\n\n633\n00:29:56.309 --> 00:30:00.274\nBut those are a few things that you have\nto keep in mind that when it comes to\n\n634\n00:30:00.274 --> 00:30:03.792\nmobile issues, remember there's\nnever any one size fits all.\n\n635\n00:30:03.792 --> 00:30:07.554\nAgain, it really sometimes can be vendor\nspecific even within the same make\n\n636\n00:30:07.554 --> 00:30:08.152\nand model.\n\n637\n00:30:08.152 --> 00:30:11.981\nKnow some of those things for the exam and\nI think you're gonna be doing well.\n\n638\n00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:15.281\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, that was definitely\na great grocery list there for\n\n639\n00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:18.221\nus to go through with the problems\nthat you might incur, or\n\n640\n00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:20.205\nthat might occur with a mobile device.\n\n641\n00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:24.391\nAnd since they're pretty ubiquitous these\ndays, users love them because they're so\n\n642\n00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:25.091\nconvenient.\n\n643\n00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:27.470\nYou're probably gonna have\nto deal with one of these or\n\n644\n00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.275\nall of them throughout your career so\njust be prepared for that.\n\n645\n00:30:30.275 --> 00:30:33.240\nAnd it's nice to know for\nthe exam as well, all right.\n\n646\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.058\nWes thanks I think you did a great\njob today I appreciate you coming by.\n\n647\n00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:39.599\nWe do wanna thank our viewers for\nwatching but we have run out of time for\n\n648\n00:30:39.599 --> 00:30:40.387\nthis episode.\n\n649\n00:30:40.387 --> 00:30:44.579\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n650\n00:30:44.579 --> 00:30:45.517\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n651\n00:30:45.517 --> 00:30:48.077\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n652\n00:30:48.077 --> 00:30:53.944\n[MUSIC]\n\n653\n00:30:53.944 --> 00:31:00.679\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:11.841\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.821\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.820\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.600\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode is more in our A+ series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.380\nWhat a wonderful series it's been so far.\n\n8\n00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.190\nAnd joining us, back in the studio\nto help us out with that endeavor,\n\n9\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.940\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.270\nWesley, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.590\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.720\nThat's right, we are continuing\nalong with trouble shooting.\n\n13\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.990\nAnd over the last few episodes, well,\nwe've been talking about all different\n\n14\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.050\ntypes of things that you can deal with\nwhen it comes to trouble shooting.\n\n15\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.230\nAnd we've even had, some mobile issues.\n\n16\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.011\nSome common issues that can happen to\nmobile OS, or mobile devices, really.\n\n17\n00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.230\nAnd what we're gonna be dealing\nwith really, right here.\n\n18\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.420\nIt's gonna be more mobility.\n\n19\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.610\nBut it's gonna be focused on\nthe security side of things.\n\n20\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.000\nSo we've got a few things\nthat we kinda wanna discuss.\n\n21\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.160\nAnd that's what is going\nto be in this episode.\n\n22\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.840\nIf you are following along out there,\nladies and gents, with the objectives,\n\n23\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.620\nthen what we're looking at\nformally is the 4.4 right?\n\n24\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.153\nAnd this is a big, old, long sentence.\n\n25\n00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:10.254\nGiven a scenario,\ntrouble shoot common in mobile OS, and\n\n26\n00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:13.430\napplication security issues\nwith the appropriate tools.\n\n27\n00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.182\nSo hopefully we can do that for you, and\nmake you a little bit more prepared for\n\n28\n00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:21.310\nthe 22902 exam as well as, maybe some\ninformation you could take away and use.\n\n29\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.268\nWhether in your home environment,\nor at work right now, and\n\n30\n00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:27.950\nwhen I say right now at least by\nthe end of this episode for sure.\n\n31\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.980\nSo let's go ahead and we are gonna dive\nright in they have a longer list of stuff\n\n32\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.560\nthat we have to look at and they always\nstarted out with common symptoms,\n\n33\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.980\nand one of the common symptoms that\nthey talk about is well, signal drop.\n\n34\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.420\nSignal drop or weak signal.\n\n35\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.700\nNow, This could be a security issue.\n\n36\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.440\nMore than anything I would say that\nif it's a signal drop completely,\n\n37\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.580\nit might not be a security\nissue on your device.\n\n38\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.385\nIt could be the fact that\nmaybe you're within the,\n\n39\n00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:57.465\nyour outside of the proximity\nto the access point.\n\n40\n00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:00.895\nIf you do believe that it is a security\nissue it could be something like\n\n41\n00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:03.285\npermissions, right,\napplication permissions.\n\n42\n00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.232\nAnd that could be something that\nyou have to worry about, right?\n\n43\n00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:10.224\nWhen we talk about permission issues keep\nin mind that any application that you\n\n44\n00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:13.014\ndownload has a certain level\nof permissions, right?\n\n45\n00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:16.097\nAnd I want to mention that,\nbecause we talked about,\n\n46\n00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:19.880\nin other episodes we talked about\napplication sources, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.370\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n48\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.044\nIf I go into the Play Store, right, and\nI'm going to download an application, and\n\n49\n00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.661\nlet me go ahead and back out, I was kind\nof looking at some different things here.\n\n50\n00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:29.929\nLet me say I was going to download\nthis application, right, and\n\n51\n00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.270\nI'm going to install it.\n\n52\n00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.113\nBut before I do, notice that it gives me,\n\n53\n00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:37.940\nwell it needs access to different things,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.930\nIt needs access to device history, right?\n\n55\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.360\nIt needs access to device ID and\ncall information,\n\n56\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.300\nwell that's okay, it's not actually\ncontrolling the device itself.\n\n57\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.640\nWell, you have to be careful\nbecause some of these devices, or\n\n58\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.460\nsome of these applications actually, will\ncontrol your device which means that they\n\n59\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.530\ncould disable wi-fi, could potentially\ndisable your cellular communications.\n\n60\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.539\nSay Wes, well wait a second here.\n\n61\n00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.481\nYou mean if I get an application from\nthe Play Store, from the App Store,\n\n62\n00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:12.720\nor from Store in Windows,\nthat it's gonna, kill my Wi-Fi?\n\n63\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.289\nNo, that's not what I am saying.\n\n64\n00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:18.960\nBut if you download software\nfrom unknown sources.\n\n65\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.220\nUntrusted locations, if you are one of\nthose ones that says you know what?\n\n66\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.810\nI will go ahead and\nI will live dangerously.\n\n67\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.655\nI am going to live on the edge right?\n\n68\n00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:28.629\nWhat I am going to do is I am\ngoing to go to the settings.\n\n69\n00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.372\nAnd let's see if we can\nfind the settings here.\n\n70\n00:03:30.372 --> 00:03:32.090\nI'm gonna go into the settings.\n\n71\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.530\nAnd I'm gonna say, you know what?\n\n72\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.550\nI will go ahead and, I believe this is\nunder security, let me check this out\n\n73\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.360\nmore there, and security, I believe,\nand notice that I have these checked.\n\n74\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.450\nI'm living dangerously.\n\n75\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.660\nWe talked about this in another episode,\nremember that, unknown sources, right?\n\n76\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.070\nAllowing the installation of applications\nfrom both trusted and unknown sources.\n\n77\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.350\nNow what do we mean by trusted?\n\n78\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.220\nWhat we mean by trusted,\n\n79\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.755\nthat means when I go into a store like\nthe play store or the app store right?\n\n80\n00:04:03.755 --> 00:04:08.371\nAnd I go to download something like\nwi-fi analyzer right, and I've already\n\n81\n00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.987\nactually got this installed but it tells\nme, right before I go to install it,\n\n82\n00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:18.250\nit needs access to things like my\nWi-Fi connection information, right?\n\n83\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.630\nWell, it's telling me\nwhat the permissions are.\n\n84\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.030\nAnd when you go to these stores, they're\ntrusted because it's letting you know hey,\n\n85\n00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.460\nthis is what I'm potentially going to do,\nor need access to.\n\n86\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.520\nWhen you download from unknown sources,\ndo you trust the APK's?\n\n87\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.235\nI don't know?\n\n88\n00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:34.897\nDo you know what they are?\n\n89\n00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:36.460\nDo you know how they were programmed?\n\n90\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.070\nDo they give you a permissions list?\n\n91\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.490\nAnd if they give you a permissions list,\ndo they give you the right permissions?\n\n92\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.470\nDo they tell you everything?\n\n93\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.674\nSo, be careful.\n\n94\n00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:50.280\nNow signal drop is, sometimes\na reason that you could break out.\n\n95\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.094\nOne of the tools that they\ntell us in the list, and\n\n96\n00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:54.276\nthat's something known as\nthe wi-fi analyzer, right?\n\n97\n00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:59.606\nAnd a wi-fi, now I'm using an application\ncalled a wi-fi analyzer, right?\n\n98\n00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:04.194\nBut it could be called different things,\ndepending on the application itself and\n\n99\n00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:06.462\nwhich application you are installing.\n\n100\n00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:09.510\nNow I'm using something, and\nlet me go ahead and show you this.\n\n101\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.670\nI'm actually using wi-fi analyzer here.\n\n102\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.750\nAnd one of the things that's\ncool about this application, and\n\n103\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.800\nI love this application, because it is one\nof these that is pretty much available for\n\n104\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.400\nall the different platforms.\n\n105\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.490\nI've used this on iOS, I've also used\nthis over here on our Android device,\n\n106\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.420\nas you can see.\n\n107\n00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.459\nBut it lets me sees things like\nthe signal strength, right?\n\n108\n00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:34.232\nAnd I get different views, I can see what\nis the signal strength of the wi-fi,\n\n109\n00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:36.784\nor the network I'm connected to.\n\n110\n00:05:36.784 --> 00:05:41.616\nAnd maybe, that might be a reason for\neither moving closer to the access point,\n\n111\n00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:44.150\nor even repositioning the access point.\n\n112\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.220\nNow we're talking more from\nthe perspective of the operating system\n\n113\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.370\nitself, but it at least gives you\ninside of the operating system,\n\n114\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.020\na chance to utilize\nan application that shows you,\n\n115\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.660\nmaybe why you do have a weak signal,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.544\nIt could just be the fact that you don't\nhave a good signal strength, as well.\n\n117\n00:06:02.544 --> 00:06:06.899\nNow, one of the other things that they\nalso call out is, things like, for\n\n118\n00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.071\ninstance, if you do have\na slow connection, right?\n\n119\n00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:12.973\nIf you do end up having\nsomething like slow data speeds,\n\n120\n00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:17.051\nyou can use things like cellphone\nanalyzers, cell analyzers, right, those\n\n121\n00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:21.248\nare really cool pieces of software, in\nfact I've got one here too I can show you,\n\n122\n00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:25.050\nthat will show me things like what\nis my current cell bandwidth, right?\n\n123\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.528\nHow close am I to the tower?\n\n124\n00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:29.490\nAll right, what is my overall\nsignal strength of the tower?\n\n125\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.660\nYou can see the bottom one there,\nit kind of does both, right?\n\n126\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.770\nSo this is a blending,\nthis is a crossing of the streams,\n\n127\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.290\nwhich we're told not to do, right?\n\n128\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.160\n&gt;&gt; Two for one sale [LAUGH].\n\n129\n00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.951\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n130\n00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:41.100\nAnd what you can see at the top there,\nis well LTE, right?\n\n131\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.880\nThe long term evolution, that is\nactually your cellular communication.\n\n132\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.150\nAnd at the bottom here I can\nsee in decimals, gain, right?\n\n133\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.470\nYour signal strength of what my\nwireless access point is too.\n\n134\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.420\nSo absolutely love this, but\nthat is something that you can use.\n\n135\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.900\nYou can use a cell analyzer too.\n\n136\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.490\nSo great thing to have,\ngood thing to be utilizing.\n\n137\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.010\nNow when we talk about applications in\ngeneral, another thing that they mention,\n\n138\n00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.020\nis what's known as an application scanner,\nall right?\n\n139\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.620\nNow an application scanner is typically\nsome kind of anti-malware device,\n\n140\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.210\nantivirus type of tool, if you will.\n\n141\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.170\nYour Android devices have things\nlike Knox built in to them.\n\n142\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.710\nAnd there's a whole debate,\nwhether you should be using Knox.\n\n143\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.250\nOr some people like it.\n\n144\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.219\nPeople that want more power,\n\n145\n00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.521\nmore control over their phone think\nit's a little bit too intrusive.\n\n146\n00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:34.860\nAnytime you're dealing with security,\nthere's always a give and take.\n\n147\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.930\nSome people like it some people hate it.\n\n148\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.820\nMe, I'm just indifferent to it.\n\n149\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.210\nBut I wanted to show you here,\n\n150\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.250\nI've got it actually built into this phone\nhere, an application scanner, right?\n\n151\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.460\nAnd this is one of the things they\nalso call out the tools inside of\n\n152\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.370\nour list here.\n\n153\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.070\nNotice scan is finished.\n\n154\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.329\nNetwork cell info lite is safe.\n\n155\n00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:52.959\nClick to activate total protection.\n\n156\n00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.287\nWe don't have to worry about all that.\n\n157\n00:07:55.287 --> 00:07:58.966\nAt least I can see anytime I'm\ndownloading or loading up an application,\n\n158\n00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:01.950\nwhat is it's doing is it's\nscanning those applications.\n\n159\n00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.870\nAnd it's letting me know, hey I'm gonna\ncheck this against reputation database.\n\n160\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.345\nKinda like smart screen filter does\ninside of the Windows operating system.\n\n161\n00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:12.640\nLets me know,\nhey is that application safe?\n\n162\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.030\nIs it doing things behind the scene\nthat I'm not aware of, right.\n\n163\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.420\nWe talk about running in root access.\n\n164\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.040\nIs it trying to acquire\nunauthorized root access?\n\n165\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.670\nThat could be something that\ngives you unauthorized usage.\n\n166\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.600\nNow other things did too.\n\n167\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.470\nAnd Dan, while we're talking about these\napplications, I'm gonna kinda go off\n\n168\n00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.990\nthe beaten path here of our notes, and\nI'll talk about unauthorized usage.\n\n169\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.930\nBecause these applications,\nif you don't pay attention to them, you\n\n170\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.740\ndon't pay attention to the permissions and\nyou just click on them, well, guess what?\n\n171\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.620\nThey're using location services and\nthey can scrape that information.\n\n172\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.790\nBecause a lot of companies,\na lot of software developers out there,\n\n173\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.900\nare using that big data,\nharvesting that information.\n\n174\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.860\nNow, I'm not saying that they're\nharvesting information for\n\n175\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.780\nmalicious purposes.\n\n176\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.120\nThat doesn't mean you use statistics and\nstuff to make and improve your software.\n\n177\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.580\nThat's one of the reasons you take and\n\n178\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.040\nuse, they talk about customer\nexperience improvement programs, CEIP,\n\n179\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.540\nif I can remember that right\ninside of Windows, they have that.\n\n180\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.400\nIn Apple, Apple has Apple Statistics and\nthey gather that information and\n\n181\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.900\nthose are some things that are built\ninto the operating system but\n\n182\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.820\nthe applications could\nbe using that as well.\n\n183\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.200\nThat's why you always have to\nlook at what the permissions say.\n\n184\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.430\nIn fact I can show you, like for instance\ninside of your Android operating systems,\n\n185\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.240\nif I get back down into\nthe Settings here and\n\n186\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.700\nI believe Application Manager,\nyou can pick on the Applications.\n\n187\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.430\nAnd when I say pick on them I'm not\ntrying to pick on any one over the other.\n\n188\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.463\nThat's not what I mean, but\nyou can pick one of the applications.\n\n189\n00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:41.496\nLet's say flipboard.\n\n190\n00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:42.980\nI love flipboard.\n\n191\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.110\nBut you can scroll down in\nyour application manager and\n\n192\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.560\nagain keep in mind, I know I kind of\nclicked through that real quick here.\n\n193\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.315\nLet's go through that one more time, guys\nand I'll slow it down a little bit here.\n\n194\n00:09:53.315 --> 00:09:54.733\nWe go to Settings right and\n\n195\n00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:57.960\nyou've got your four different\nlocations across the top.\n\n196\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.580\nIf I go to More,\ngo to Application Manager,\n\n197\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.660\none of the things I can do is\ntake any one of the applications,\n\n198\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.940\ntrip adviser I just have to\nbe taken on flip board here.\n\n199\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.062\nLet's go and pick trip advisor.\n\n200\n00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:10.065\nAnd if I scroll down to the bottom,\n\n201\n00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:14.510\nnotice one of the things that we just\ntalked about, proximate location.\n\n202\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Knows your location information.\n\n203\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.830\nPrecise location, GPS and network-based.\n\n204\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.240\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't even matter\n\n205\n00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.360\nwhat you're on, right?\n\n206\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.140\nIt could be your cellular data or\nany kind of wireless connection.\n\n207\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.410\n&gt;&gt; You got it, absolutely Dan.\n\n208\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.910\nSo we gotta be careful with that.\n\n209\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.980\nActivity recognition, right.\n\n210\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.280\nModify, delete the contents\nof your storage.\n\n211\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.060\nRead the contents of your storage.\n\n212\n00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.803\nWhen you talk about unauthorized usage or\nleaking personal files, or personal data\n\n213\n00:10:43.803 --> 00:10:47.831\nthat’s in our list as well, I might\nbe able to blame it on Trip Advisor.\n\n214\n00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:50.636\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna go get me a dumb phone.\n\n215\n00:10:50.636 --> 00:10:51.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n216\n00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:52.580\n&gt;&gt; This phone is too smart.\n\n217\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely.\n\n218\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.200\nLook what else it can do.\n\n219\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.530\nAdd accounts.\n\n220\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.350\nAll right.\n\n221\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.800\nYeah, add accounts.\n\n222\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.620\nAdd or remove it.\n\n223\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.660\nCreate accounts.\n\n224\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.480\nAnd turn around and set passwords.\n\n225\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's not a problem.\n\n226\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.040\n&gt;&gt; Read your Google service configuration.\n\n227\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.230\nUse accounts on the device.\n\n228\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.030\nFull network access,\nreceive data from the Internet.\n\n229\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.896\nAll right, now, if you're like me,\n\n230\n00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:21.549\nif you're receiving information for\na third party, we call that a virus.\n\n231\n00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:24.682\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Again this is why you have to kind of\n\n232\n00:11:24.682 --> 00:11:30.560\nopen your eyes to what you are saying\nyes to when you click the installers.\n\n233\n00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.050\nI know I just caught Dan\noff guard on that one.\n\n234\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.320\nBecause you should have seen his\neyes when it said Set Account.\n\n235\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.900\nNow that's one I have\nto say it got me too.\n\n236\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.243\n&gt;&gt; Me and Supervisor ain't friends now.\n\n237\n00:11:44.243 --> 00:11:48.840\n&gt;&gt; So if you're in a home environment,\nyou might not be worried about that guys.\n\n238\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.106\nIt improves your experience, right?\n\n239\n00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:54.920\nBut if you are in a corporate environment,\nthat can be problematic.\n\n240\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.480\nAbsolutely.\n\n241\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.654\nAnd I can only imagine at some of\nthe enterprise levels environments\n\n242\n00:11:58.654 --> 00:12:01.171\nthat you have been in Dan\nthat we would have problems.\n\n243\n00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:05.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you are connecting\nthese devices into an environment that's\n\n244\n00:12:05.363 --> 00:12:08.910\ncorporate enterprise in nature,\nmaybe governmental.\n\n245\n00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.950\nAnd it is allowing that type of access.\n\n246\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.710\nWell that just becomes a hole\nin the security, right?\n\n247\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.490\nBecause it's saying well I have access\nto all these things and maybe for\n\n248\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.320\nwhatever reason I can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n249\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.710\nMaybe someone's figured out\nhow to take advantage of it.\n\n250\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.190\nIf you have Trip Advisor's probably\nnot doing anything with your stuff.\n\n251\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.870\nThey don't care about creating\naccounts on your computer.\n\n252\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.200\nAll they care about is marketing to\nyou and collecting your information so\n\n253\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.050\nthey can better market to you and\n\n254\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.420\nsell that information to other\ncompanies that wanna market to you.\n\n255\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.010\nThat's what that's all about.\n\n256\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:42.350\nBut the person with maliciousness and\nintent behind their little hearts\n\n257\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.600\nwould definitely use something\nlike that to their advantage.\n\n258\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.120\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we have to make\nsure that we trust the sources.\n\n259\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.370\nI've used Trip Advisor.\n\n260\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.370\nI use it on a common day.\n\n261\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.600\nSo again out there, if you guys are\nwatching us out there from Trip Advisor\n\n262\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.380\nwe're most definitely not dogging\non the software by any means.\n\n263\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.480\nWhat I'm saying is if you're\ndownloaded from untrusted sources,\n\n264\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.610\nthey're being legit.\n\n265\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.430\nThey're telling you hey,\nthis is what, in order for\n\n266\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.880\nthe experience to work with our\nsoftware might potentially happen.\n\n267\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.860\nIt doesn't mean like Dan said that\nthey actually are gonna do that but\n\n268\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.960\nthey're being honest and open with you\nabout what they could potentially do\n\n269\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.410\nin order to run this application.\n\n270\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.314\nOther applications that had\ncome from unknown sources,\n\n271\n00:13:21.314 --> 00:13:24.330\nthey might not be as legitimate and\nthey might not be as open and\n\n272\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.868\nhonest as some of the permissions that\nwe see here across these different\n\n273\n00:13:27.868 --> 00:13:31.534\napplications I am looking at\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you download Trip Advisor from\n\n274\n00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:35.732\nBen's bargain bin apps, right,\nit's not in any kind of Apps store.\n\n275\n00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.073\nAnd it says, hey go ahead and\n\n276\n00:13:37.073 --> 00:13:39.920\nit's an untrusted source but\nyes it's Trip Advisor go ahead.\n\n277\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.980\nMay be he just named it Trip Advisor,\nright, and looks like Trip Advisor,\n\n278\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.472\nsmells like TripAdvisor.\n\n279\n00:13:45.472 --> 00:13:46.762\nBut it ain't Trip Advisor.\n\n280\n00:13:46.762 --> 00:13:48.205\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n281\n00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:51.310\nthey spelled the S in there\nwith a dollar sign, right?\n\n282\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.850\n&gt;&gt; So those are things that, again,\n\n284\n00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.450\nwhen we first started,\nwe talked about signal drop,\n\n285\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.450\nwe talked about weak signal, again.\n\n286\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.590\nAnd then we moved into things\nlike power drain, right?\n\n287\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.946\nAgain, this is where the application\nmanager also comes in.\n\n288\n00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:09.038\nIf it comes to power drain, you could\nhave an application that's running in\n\n289\n00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:12.390\nthe background again based on permissions,\nand you're not aware of it, right?\n\n290\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.370\nAll of those things that we've seen\nthat are going on in the background,\n\n291\n00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.860\nif you're not aware of it, this could\nbe a security vulnerability, and\n\n292\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.180\nit could be just basically draining\nyour battery in the background,\n\n293\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.070\nand you're not even aware of it.\n\n294\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.780\nOne other great things that you can do is,\nif you do go into, and in fact,\n\n295\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.060\nlet me go ahead and show you, I can\nprobably just get there fairly quickly.\n\n296\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.135\nLet's see here, now I tell you what.\n\n297\n00:14:32.135 --> 00:14:37.020\nWe'll start over again, we'll go back to\nSettings, go back to Application Manager,\n\n298\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.990\nand we can bump on over to running.\n\n299\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.965\nAnd one of the great things about this\nis this is kinda like your task manager\n\n300\n00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.475\ninside of your operating systems, right?\n\n301\n00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:48.546\nSo you can see for instance,\nI could school through here and\n\n302\n00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:50.585\nI can see everything that's running.\n\n303\n00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:52.666\nEven stuff that I want running, right.\n\n304\n00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:57.035\nSo portions of the actual Android\noperating system are running here too.\n\n305\n00:14:57.035 --> 00:15:02.000\nNow I'm not gonna disconnect any of these\nbut you could force stop these, right?\n\n306\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.500\nIf I force stop it, be careful,\nthere's dependencies.\n\n307\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.980\nYou could be causing some problems here.\n\n308\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.610\nSo again, if you don't recognize\nwhatever the process is that is running,\n\n309\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.765\ndo some research, right?\n\n310\n00:15:13.765 --> 00:15:18.763\nwww.googe.com right, find now.\n\n311\n00:15:18.763 --> 00:15:21.750\nYou have things like any malware\nsoftware that’s out there.\n\n312\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.900\nYou have the makers of the software,\nright.\n\n313\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.040\nAnd they keep track on the different files\nthat are running within the operating\n\n314\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.330\nsystems so that you are aware and\nthey keep a database, right.\n\n315\n00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.850\nThey work with the manufacturers.\n\n316\n00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.940\nKeep a database of what\nshould be recognizable.\n\n317\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.903\nAnd if something is in there and\nit's unrecognisable,\n\n318\n00:15:39.903 --> 00:15:42.171\nwell then you can be made aware of that,\nand\n\n319\n00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:46.533\npotentially stop any of these processes\nthat might be going on in the background.\n\n320\n00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:48.854\nWe have already talked about\nother power saving techniques.\n\n321\n00:15:48.854 --> 00:15:54.513\nFor stop applications, dim your display,\ndisable wi-fi or cellular if you have to,\n\n322\n00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:59.569\nif you are basically not using it as\nat the time, disable bluetooth, right?\n\n323\n00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:02.508\nIf you are not using bluetooth,\nturn it off.\n\n324\n00:16:02.508 --> 00:16:05.512\nWhy?\nBecause you could get unintended Bluetooth\n\n325\n00:16:05.512 --> 00:16:07.300\nconnections.\n\n326\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.610\nNow, unintended Bluetooth connections\ncould be just a configuration problem,\n\n327\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.020\ncould be that you paired a device and\nforgot that you paired it in the past.\n\n328\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.339\nIt could be, and this has happened to me,\nit actually happened on my Macbook where\n\n329\n00:16:18.339 --> 00:16:22.239\nI wasn't paying attention to the pairing\nprocess of a Bluetooth device.\n\n330\n00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:25.271\nAnd I actually clicked somebody's speaker\nbar that was in an apartment next to me.\n\n331\n00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:29.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I probably scared the heck out of\n\n332\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.610\nthem when I turned my YouTube\non to some heavy metal song,\n\n333\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.400\nand it probably came out\nthrough their speakers.\n\n334\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.781\nSo if you're watching and you know me as\na neighbor, I apologize ahead of time.\n\n335\n00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:41.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it happens, right?\n\n336\n00:16:41.029 --> 00:16:43.749\nThat could be an unintended thing\nwhere it was actually part of it,\n\n337\n00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:45.010\nit was the user fault.\n\n338\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.057\nThe other thing you have to worry about\nare there are other types of Bluetooth\n\n339\n00:16:48.057 --> 00:16:51.297\nunintended Bluetooth connections out\nthere lead themselves like Bluesnarfing\n\n340\n00:16:51.297 --> 00:16:52.790\nattacks and Bluejacking attacks.\n\n341\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.138\nBluejacking attack is where I'm\ngonna try to attach myself and\n\n342\n00:16:56.138 --> 00:17:00.005\nhighjack your signal to send out my\nBluetooth communications, right?\n\n343\n00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:03.355\nSo that speaker bar is open, you get\nsomebody who's got the black hat on,\n\n344\n00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.690\nthey find a way to get into\nthat Bluetooth speaker.\n\n345\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.090\nAnd then, once they're there,\nthey launch an attack or\n\n346\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.407\nthey send their information\nacross that communication.\n\n347\n00:17:10.407 --> 00:17:12.320\nBluesnarfing is a little bit different.\n\n348\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.020\nMaybe I wanna gain access to your\nBluetooth device through that\n\n349\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.390\nconnection for the purposes of\nscraping your information, right?\n\n350\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.821\nThose could lead into things\nlike unintended, not attended,\n\n351\n00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:27.517\nunintended BlueTooth communications or\nconnections, as well.\n\n352\n00:17:27.517 --> 00:17:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Your Bluetooth connection\nis unattended, Wes.\n\n353\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n354\n00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.470\nKind of mentioned slow data speeds.\n\n355\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.620\nSlow data speeds could just be the fact\nthat you've got too many applications\n\n356\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.290\nthat are all running at once.\n\n357\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.670\nYou could have updates that\nare going on in the background.\n\n358\n00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.220\nYou could have device synchronization\nthat's going on, and there's data that's\n\n359\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.390\nsynchronizing in the background and that\ncould be hogging up all your bandwidth.\n\n360\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.910\nYou could be in a dead zone\nreally when it comes down to it.\n\n361\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.640\nYou could be in a limited area.\n\n362\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.130\nThat's where things like your WiFi\nanalyzers and your cell locators and\n\n363\n00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.930\nstuff can detect what the signal strength\nis of your cellular data network or\n\n364\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.060\nyour wireless network.\n\n365\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.900\nUnintended, I tell you,\nI'm gonna try and say that every time.\n\n366\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You don't want\nanybody watching that stuff.\n\n367\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.100\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Unintended WiFi communication or\n\n368\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.450\nWiFi connection.\n\n369\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:23.220\nSometimes this can happen because when\nyou've connected to a WiFi network,\n\n370\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.260\nyour computer typically remembers it,\nright?\n\n371\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.690\nSo one of the things you might have to\ndo is actually forget the network if\n\n372\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.540\nyou go to connect to it.\n\n373\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.780\nHere's another thing that could happen,\ntoo.\n\n374\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.270\nSometimes people say, look,\n\n375\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.560\nthere's an open wireless access\npoint in my apartment complex.\n\n376\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.550\nLet's go ahead and click on it.\n\n377\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.770\nI'm not saying,\nyou shouldn't be doing that, right.\n\n378\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.040\nFirst of all, that's illegal in so\nmany, probably so many states that\n\n379\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.750\nyour connecting to somebody else's\nnetwork with out them knowing it, right?\n\n380\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.030\nThe other problem is,\nis that if you connect, and\n\n381\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.020\nyou forget about that, again, unintended,\nyou turn around and connect to it.\n\n382\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.700\nSo, let me go ahead and show you that,\nagain, some of these stuff we already kind\n\n383\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.540\nof covered in other episodes, but\nit is good to know where you can do this.\n\n384\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.219\nGoing into settings,\nI can go to connections &gt; WiFi, and\n\n385\n00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:12.535\nif it happens to be a Network\nthat I'm connected to.\n\n386\n00:19:12.535 --> 00:19:15.799\nSo, for instance,\nI'm connected to the ITPRO TV Network,\n\n387\n00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:18.380\nnotice that I have this Forget option,\nright.\n\n388\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.140\nAnd I can just click that Forget\noption and no longer connected to it.\n\n389\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.420\nAnd then it would just\nbe as simple as finding,\n\n390\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.120\nthat is not the one that I wanna connect\nto again, speaking of unintended.\n\n391\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.541\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The one that I wanna connect to,\n\n392\n00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:34.241\nI could go and\nreconnect to ITPRO.TV network,\n\n393\n00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:37.770\nif that happens to be the one\nthat I actually wanna connect to.\n\n394\n00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.750\nAll right, that's why pay\nattention to your permissions.\n\n395\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.322\nWe've already talked about\nleaked personal files and data,\n\n396\n00:19:43.322 --> 00:19:46.347\nkeep in mind this could be something\nas simple as a social media exploit.\n\n397\n00:19:46.347 --> 00:19:50.385\nIf you've been attacked\nwith like a phishing scam,\n\n398\n00:19:50.385 --> 00:19:54.789\nif somebody happens to try to\nmirror one of your friends'\n\n399\n00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:59.579\naccounts on social media and\nyou fall into that trap, right?\n\n400\n00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:03.030\nPeople could be hijacking your account,\nhijacking email, again,\n\n401\n00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.227\ncould be a phish email.\n\n402\n00:20:04.227 --> 00:20:08.092\nCould just be like we've already shown\nyou some permissions issues there.\n\n403\n00:20:08.092 --> 00:20:11.576\nAnd the fact that you didn't pay attention\nto the permissions when you downloaded\n\n404\n00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:14.807\nthe application, not realizing like you\nsee in a laundry list of things that\n\n405\n00:20:14.807 --> 00:20:16.947\nare actually being sent\nwithout you being aware.\n\n406\n00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:20.550\nOr you were made aware but\nyou didn't read the fine print too.\n\n407\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.810\nSo it could be,\nagain it could be a trusted application,\n\n408\n00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.290\nit could be unknown sources likewise.\n\n409\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.760\nAll right, so data transmission\nover limit, what happens here?\n\n410\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.270\nBoy this happens to a lot,\nin fact it's kind of interesting,\n\n411\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.730\nthis just happened to me at\nthe beginning of this week.\n\n412\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.790\nLast week I went on vacation, it's my own\nfault, last week I went on vacation and I\n\n413\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.310\nreally didn't have a good WiFi connection\nin the house that I was staying in, and\n\n414\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.294\nunfortunately chewed through all my data.\n\n415\n00:20:48.294 --> 00:20:52.720\nDidn't realize how much stuff that was\nactually connecting in the background, and\n\n416\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.640\nyes in one week, somehow I went through\nmore than 8 gigs of data bandwidth, right?\n\n417\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.230\nSo that can happen.\n\n418\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:05.703\nOne of the things you can do here like for\ninstance most of these devices let me show\n\n419\n00:21:05.703 --> 00:21:11.437\nyou here, you can look at things like data\nusage, and you could set limits, right?\n\n420\n00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:15.391\nThis one, I could set the mobile\ndata limit here and I can,\n\n421\n00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:19.941\nI believe I remember right,\nlet me see if I can, yep, there we go.\n\n422\n00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:23.772\nAnd I can set a period,\na timeframe here, and I don't know,\n\n423\n00:21:23.772 --> 00:21:27.320\nit doesn't seem to,\nmaybe I gotta throttle it up.\n\n424\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.431\nI think that's, is that gigabits?\n\n425\n00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:35.190\nYeah, anyhow, notice that there is this\nthreshold that you could potentially set.\n\n426\n00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.620\nAnd I could say,\nafter I end up setting this, hey,\n\n427\n00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.558\ndon't go over that limit, that threshold.\n\n428\n00:21:41.558 --> 00:21:44.250\nAnd what it'll do,\nyou've gotta be careful,\n\n429\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.210\nbecause now you won't have the ability\nto send information, right?\n\n430\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.950\nBecause after you hit that threshold,\nyou'll cease to send out.\n\n431\n00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.890\nNow, it's a good thing if you wanna\nmake sure that you don't go over\n\n432\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.500\nyour bandwidth.\n\n433\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.757\nIf you are at a data transmission over\nlimit and you really haven't been using\n\n434\n00:22:01.757 --> 00:22:06.227\nthe phone too much, chances are you need\nto pay attention to your applications.\n\n435\n00:22:06.227 --> 00:22:09.544\nAnd you might need to run through\nthat list in application manager and\n\n436\n00:22:09.544 --> 00:22:12.975\ncheck whether you have some kind of\npermissions that are saying, hey,\n\n437\n00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:15.400\nwe're gonna be sending our information.\n\n438\n00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.645\nYou can check the application manager for\nrunning processes as well,\n\n439\n00:22:18.645 --> 00:22:21.732\nworst case scenario, you might\nactually have to a factory reset.\n\n440\n00:22:21.732 --> 00:22:25.492\nIf any of these devices\nget to a point where maybe\n\n441\n00:22:25.492 --> 00:22:29.630\nyou're not exactly sure what's going on,\nright?\n\n442\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.615\nYou might have to do a complete factory\nreset or a factory reinstall, and\n\n443\n00:22:33.615 --> 00:22:38.400\ncompletely reinstall the operating system,\nthat might be something that you can do.\n\n444\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.338\nIt could be something where\nmaybe you've got iTunes, or\n\n445\n00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:46.550\niCloud if you will, and\nyou back the device up to the Cloud.\n\n446\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.830\nIf you've got an iOS device,\nyou backup to iTunes.\n\n447\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:54.288\nAnd if you ever need to, you can\nalways restore your operating system,\n\n448\n00:22:54.288 --> 00:22:58.400\niOS operating system just by pulling\nthat backup down from iTunes or iCloud.\n\n449\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.184\nAgain, they kinda run hand in hand\ntoday with all the signal sign on type\n\n450\n00:23:02.184 --> 00:23:03.380\nimplementations.\n\n451\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.083\nIf you happen to be in something\nlike a corporate environment,\n\n452\n00:23:06.083 --> 00:23:08.941\nyou might be using something like\nthe Apple configurator as well.\n\n453\n00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:12.060\nThis might be something that\nthe administrator is using.\n\n454\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.680\nIf you're in Android based devices,\n\n455\n00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.170\nyou can use things like Google Sync,\nGoogle Drive in combination, right?\n\n456\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:22.190\nAnd you could synchronize your information\nand your settings up to the Cloud through\n\n457\n00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.270\nGoogle Sync, or Google Drive if you will,\nand you could pull those devices too.\n\n458\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.351\nIn the Microsoft world we have\nwhat's known as OneDrive, and again,\n\n459\n00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:33.170\nit's just like another of that\nsoftware as a service if you will.\n\n460\n00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.380\nIt's just a software based\nstorage solution that you can\n\n461\n00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.110\nback up in your Windows mobile devices,\nall of your settings,\n\n462\n00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.960\nyour operating system if you will.\n\n463\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.110\nBackup to the Cloud, basically you can\ndo a reinstall or restore, if you will.\n\n464\n00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.990\nRestore the operating system,\nor again, like I said,\n\n465\n00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.590\ncompletely reinstall the operating\nsystem and pull all these settings down.\n\n466\n00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.371\nIf it's not that serious,\nif it isn't that serious and\n\n467\n00:23:56.371 --> 00:23:59.981\nit ends up being more of just an\napplication that you have to worry about,\n\n468\n00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:03.728\nthen, simply just uninstall\nthe application and reinstall it.\n\n469\n00:24:03.728 --> 00:24:06.870\nIf it happens to be something that you\nthink is going on because of a permissions\n\n470\n00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.930\nissue that you don't really agree with,\nuninstall the application and\n\n471\n00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:10.690\nnever reinstall it.\n\n472\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.530\nIf it happens to be something\nfrom an untrusted source and\n\n473\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.100\nyou think it's a problem, again,\nuninstall it and never reinstall it.\n\n474\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.690\nAgain, it really comes down to\nthe severity of the problem, so\n\n475\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.950\nyeah, do keep that in mind.\n\n476\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.590\nAlso be careful,\nthat if you are gonna do a factory reset,\n\n477\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.810\nor a clean install,\nyou're gonna lose all of the user data,\n\n478\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.370\nall the user settings,\nand user applications.\n\n479\n00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.580\nIf you happen to think that it's malware,\n\n480\n00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.560\nrun your antivirus scans,\nany malware scans.\n\n481\n00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.910\nUse application scanners so that you're\naware of what's running in the background.\n\n482\n00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.590\nWorst case scenario, always back up your\ndata so that if you do have to do any of\n\n483\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.580\nthese more extreme or invasive measures,\nyou at least have the ability to have\n\n484\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.100\naccess to your information,\nyour important information.\n\n485\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.600\nFor me, I don't know about you Dan,\nactually I take that back, I do know.\n\n486\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.790\nPictures of my kids are just important,\nright?\n\n487\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.397\nAnd those are things that I can't afford\nto lose, I don't care if I don't have any\n\n488\n00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:10.402\nof the applications, or\nI don't even have the operating systems.\n\n489\n00:25:10.402 --> 00:25:11.053\nThose are memories.\n\n490\n00:25:11.053 --> 00:25:15.572\nSo again, best preventative maintenance\nand normal system maintenance as well is\n\n491\n00:25:15.572 --> 00:25:19.587\nto make sure that you are running some\nkind of synchronization software.\n\n492\n00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:23.241\nSo that you can back up the port and\ninformation that at least goes to Cloud so\n\n493\n00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:25.967\nthat if these invasive measures\nyou need to implement,\n\n494\n00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:28.510\nyou'll still have access\nto that data later.\n\n495\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nkeeping our devices on lockdown,\n\n496\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.690\nmaking sure that they are secure,\nvery important facet of our job and\n\n497\n00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.650\nour environments in today's day and\nage, that's for sure.\n\n498\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:43.322\nToo many people out there trying to break\ninto stuff, steal data, steal identities,\n\n499\n00:25:43.322 --> 00:25:45.050\nyou name it, it's happening.\n\n500\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.020\nSo you have to be as secure as you can\nwhen it comes to all of your devices that\n\n501\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.540\nincludes these mobile devices as well.\n\n502\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.650\nCuz, as Wes has iterated over and\nover again,\n\n503\n00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.770\nthey're basically just little computers\nthat you carry around with you and\n\n504\n00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.360\nput everything that you have about you on.\n\n505\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.160\nSo you wanna be very,\nvery careful with them.\n\n506\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.110\nYou've given us great ways in\nwhich we can detect whether or\n\n507\n00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.500\nnot something might or\nmight not be happening.\n\n508\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.590\nAnd some tools that can help lend to\nour aid if something has happened, or\n\n509\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.720\nto prevent things from happening.\n\n510\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.725\nVery cool stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:12.725 --> 00:26:13.960\nWes, we thank you for your time today.\n\n512\n00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.980\nWe do thank our audience for\nwatching as well.\n\n513\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.870\nWe always appreciate you\nwhen you guys stop by.\n\n514\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.170\nDefinitely come back for\nmore in our A+ series.\n\n515\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.100\nBut as for this episode goes,\nwe are calling it a day.\n\n516\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.560\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n517\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.380\nThanks for watching.\n\n518\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.150\n&gt;&gt; I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n519\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.663\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n520\n00:26:28.663 --> 00:26:34.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n521\n00:26:34.466 --> 00:26:37.741\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n4\n00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:17.240\nthank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.872\nI'm Zack Memos your host as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA A+902.\n\n6\n00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:24.880\nAnd we're gonna be talking about\nsafety procedures right now.\n\n7\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.950\nAnd Wes Bryan, he's the guy who\nknows what to do, don't you?\n\n8\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.460\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nif some people have been around me,\n\n9\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.010\nI know how to break some things.\n\n10\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.825\nMy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.771\n&gt;&gt; Nickname here is called Galactus.\n\n12\n00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:38.921\nIf you need it broken, you just\ngive it to me for a few minutes and\n\n13\n00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.060\nI will take care of it.\n\n14\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.787\nAny of you guys out there that\nremember the Goonies, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:44.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Back in the 80s, right?\n\n16\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.140\nThey gave Chunk the paper, or what was it?\n\n17\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.520\nThe piece of art, right?\n\n18\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.050\nAnd the guy turns around and he counts.\n\n19\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.905\nHe's like three, two,\none, and he drops it?\n\n20\n00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:56.330\n[LAUGH] Well that's basically me.\n\n21\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.220\nThank goodness,\n\n22\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.842\nto go along with my cat like reflexes-\n&gt;&gt; Indeed.\n\n23\n00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:04.091\n&gt;&gt; I also know the safety procedures\nthat can help you survive the day.\n\n24\n00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:08.148\nSo that's what we're gonna talk about,\nwe're moving into Domain 5.0.\n\n25\n00:01:08.148 --> 00:01:12.530\nWe've actually been here a little bit now\nand this is the operational procedures.\n\n26\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.150\nIt is important, we've also talked about\nother things like professionalism and\n\n27\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.260\ncommunication, rights?So,\nthis follows along in line.\n\n28\n00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.480\nAnd keep in mind that a lot of people,\nthey like to jump in,\n\n29\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.420\nI wanna know about the software, right?\n\n30\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.990\nWe wanna know about the hardware,\nwe wanna know about security.\n\n31\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.040\nCool things like, how do we treat\nviruses and stuff like that and malware.\n\n32\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.949\nAnd then,\nwe get into some of these topics.\n\n33\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.950\nI can see a little dry and tall.\n\n34\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.803\nBut however, I want you to understand that\nthis is about protecting the components\n\n35\n00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.922\nthat you work with,\nprotecting maybe information,\n\n36\n00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:50.799\nprotecting the environment around you,\nbut most importantly, protecting you.\n\n37\n00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.500\nAll right, and I guess the environment is\nalso important too, so don't get me wrong.\n\n38\n00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.027\nCertainly not talking down.\n\n39\n00:01:57.027 --> 00:02:01.941\nI'll tell you what, we live in Florida\nhere and and I love fishing absolutely.\n\n40\n00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:06.800\nAnd I'm one of those ones that loves\npaying for the fishing license.\n\n41\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.840\nI say I love paying for it.\n\n42\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.250\nWho wants to give money?\n\n43\n00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.250\nI don't mind it, right,\nbecause that just ensures that my sons,\n\n44\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.910\nand my sons sons can continue to fish\nthese beautiful waters we have in Florida.\n\n45\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.060\nSo environment is important.\n\n46\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.836\nI don't want you guys to think that\nI'm downing that by any means, but\n\n47\n00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:25.791\nremember you all out there,\nyou are ones in billions.\n\n48\n00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.070\nYou can never be replaced.\n\n49\n00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.660\nI don't care how expensive the hardware\nis, I don't care how expensive\n\n50\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.280\nthe software is that you work with,\nit can always be replaced, right?\n\n51\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.960\nYou guys can.\n\n52\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.640\nSo these are important topics and\nwe want you to know them.\n\n53\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.460\nSo, lets go ahead and\nthe first thing we wanna talk about,\n\n54\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.710\nit really boils down to\nthree different things.\n\n55\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.770\nYou're gonna look at these\nthree different objectives.\n\n56\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.460\nAnd you can boil it down to how\ndo we protect the devices and\n\n57\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.150\nthe components that we work with.\n\n58\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.280\nHow do we protect\nthe environment around us.\n\n59\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.802\nAnd then finally,\nhow do we protect you the person.\n\n60\n00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.668\nAnd that's really what you're\ngonna see as we go through these.\n\n61\n00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:03.764\nAll right, so the first one they talk\nabout is proper component handling and\n\n62\n00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:04.792\nstorage, right?\n\n63\n00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:07.010\nAnd there are a few things\nthat we're gonna look at.\n\n64\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.711\nWe're gonna look at things\nlike anti-static bags.\n\n65\n00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:11.681\nThe term ESD, electrostatic discharge,\n\n66\n00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.270\nwe have a couple different things\nwe have to worry about there.\n\n67\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.806\nElectrostatic discharge or\nESD straps as well as ESD mats, and\n\n68\n00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:22.021\nalso things like self-grounding\ntechniques, right?\n\n69\n00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:24.952\nAnd that's gonna be something that's\nimportant when it comes to the proper\n\n70\n00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:28.060\ncomponent handling procedures and\ntechniques that we implement.\n\n71\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.833\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds like, we have to worry\nabout static charge, is that right?\n\n72\n00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.150\nCan you tell us more about that?\n\n73\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so static charge, right?\n\n74\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.140\nLet's think about it, right?\n\n75\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.990\nStatic charge,\n\n76\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.560\neveryone of you have probably felt\nsome kind of static charge, right?\n\n77\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.040\nThat's where you have this build up\nof this electric energy, if you will.\n\n78\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.770\nThis static electric energy that\nis build up in a body, right?\n\n79\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.790\nAnd what happens when we get\nelectrostatic discharge is\n\n80\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.515\nthat it moves that charge, right?\n\n81\n00:03:57.515 --> 00:04:01.850\nThe electrical charge moves from\none body to another body, right?\n\n82\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.567\nNow, Let's say with Zach and I, right,\n\n83\n00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:09.315\nhere as we move into the drier months\nas we go closer to December, right?\n\n84\n00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.480\nThat's gonna happen, Zach and I,\nhey how you doing Zach, what's going on?\n\n85\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.530\nWe reach out, we shake hands,\nwe zap each other, right?\n\n86\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.458\nThat's where you actually kind of notice-\n&gt;&gt; Especially Wes, he likes to zap.\n\n87\n00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n88\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.010\nIt's a very shocking experience for\nsure, right?\n\n89\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.240\nThat's where we tend to notice more so\nthan anything.\n\n90\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.400\nWe notice electrostatic discharge, right?\n\n91\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.896\nBut we gonna understand\nthat with the components,\n\n92\n00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:32.920\nwe also have to worry about\nelectrostatic discharge as well.\n\n93\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.504\nIn fact, let me tell you a little bit\nabout static electricity and why it's so\n\n94\n00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:38.448\ndetrimental to our components, right?\n\n95\n00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:40.110\nWhen you feel static charge,\n\n96\n00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.670\nand what I'm talking about is\nvery basically feel it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.480\nYou probably felt this before, right?\n\n98\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.402\nMaybe the hairs in the back of\nthe neck kinda stand up, right?\n\n99\n00:04:48.402 --> 00:04:52.804\nWe sometimes joke around and say,\nthat's a ghost walking through you, right?\n\n100\n00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:55.894\nWe feel the hairs on your\nback of your neck, right?\n\n101\n00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:58.647\nWell, if you've ever had\nsomebody rub a balloon and\n\n102\n00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:01.523\nit put it next to hair on your arms or\nhair on your head and\n\n103\n00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:04.922\nit kind of stands up, right,\nthat's a static charge, right?\n\n104\n00:05:04.922 --> 00:05:07.946\nWell, when you start to notice\nthat static charge in your body,\n\n105\n00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:09.802\nyou're at about 30,000 volts.\n\n106\n00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:12.270\nNow, keep in mind you might say,\nwell, that's a lot of volts.\n\n107\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.207\nWell, it's a lot of volts but it doesn't\nhave a lot of amperage behind it, so\n\n108\n00:05:16.207 --> 00:05:18.280\nit's not really harmful, if you will.\n\n109\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.240\nNow remember one of the things that I\nmentioned is that, like I said, Zach here.\n\n110\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.994\nHim and I during the cold months,\nright, when the air's very, very dry,\n\n111\n00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.876\nwe shake hands and\nwe zap each other, right?\n\n112\n00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:33.930\nOne of us zaps the other is\nusually how it works out.\n\n113\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.990\nUsually not doing that both together.\n\n114\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.420\nIt's one has a lesser\ncharge than the other.\n\n115\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.670\nAnd it's gonna go to that unequal body,\nif you will.\n\n116\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.690\nWell, when you electrically arc out,\nwhen you can actually see the spark,\n\n117\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.080\nyou're in about 30,000 volts, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.200\nAnd when we talk about 30,000 volts,\n\n119\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.440\nagain, that's a lot of\nelectricity in your body, right?\n\n120\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.485\nWell, here's something I want\nyou to keep in mind, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.090\nWhen you can feel it,\nyou're at 3,000 volts.\n\n122\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.670\nWhen you see the arc,\nyou're at 30,000 volts.\n\n123\n00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.514\nIt only takes about ten volts,\nten volts to ruin some of the very fine\n\n124\n00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:13.312\nsensitive circulatory that's on your\nprinted circuit board, your memory chips.\n\n125\n00:06:13.312 --> 00:06:16.911\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying instead of\nwhat you can feel it's about what you\n\n126\n00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.647\ncan't feel.\n\n127\n00:06:17.647 --> 00:06:21.660\n&gt;&gt; It's a very good way to put it and\nit's absolutely true, all right?\n\n128\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.980\nIt's not about what you can feel.\n\n129\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.650\nThat makes electrostatic discharge, right,\nthat movement of that static buildup,\n\n130\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.110\nthat static electrical buildup\nfrom one body to the next.\n\n131\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.760\nIt's about what you can't feel.\n\n132\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.500\nBecause again, by the time you can fee it,\nat 3000 volts, you're\n\n133\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.110\nalready at 300 times what it takes to ruin\ncircuitry, let alone if you get an arc.\n\n134\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.600\nAll right, so this is where\ngrounding techniques come in.\n\n135\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.390\nAnd there's a few different\nways that we can do this.\n\n136\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.582\nYou can use things like this, right?\n\n137\n00:06:46.582 --> 00:06:49.027\nAnd I know it's kind of shiny\non the camera here, but\n\n138\n00:06:49.027 --> 00:06:52.097\nthis is an electrostatic mat,\nall right or an anti-static bag.\n\n139\n00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:57.033\nAnd what the anti-static bag does is it\nprovides a static charge from entering\n\n140\n00:06:57.033 --> 00:06:58.990\ninto a circuit board, right?\n\n141\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.640\nAnd that's important, right?\n\n142\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.310\nSo when you are handling devices, right,\nthings like for instance your memory\n\n143\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.390\nmodules, things like for instance\nyour expansion cards, motherboards.\n\n144\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.228\nIn fact, this was actually one that\nmotherboard was delivered in, right?\n\n145\n00:07:14.228 --> 00:07:18.330\nIt is important especially storing it that\nyou store it in these anti-static bags.\n\n146\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.030\nIt's very important.\n\n147\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.699\nNow there's a couple other\nthings that they call out, too.\n\n148\n00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.490\nYou might hear this called\na couple of things.\n\n149\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.920\nYou might hear it called\nan anti-static wrist strap.\n\n150\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.500\nYou might hear it called a geek strap.\n\n151\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.725\nIn fact, I was just talking to one\nof our technicians, and really,\n\n152\n00:07:31.725 --> 00:07:35.629\njust our all-around property manager in\nthe background, and I said, hey Nate,\n\n153\n00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:36.710\nyou got a geek strap.\n\n154\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.070\nHe knew exactly what I meant, right?\n\n155\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.130\nSo when we talk about an ESD wrist strap,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n156\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.070\nLet's give Uline some credit here.\n\n157\n00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.100\nAgain, I'm using their products here.\n\n158\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.160\nThey make a lot of good products,\n3M's another one out there.\n\n159\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.478\nBut Uline,\nlet's give them the credit here.\n\n160\n00:07:51.478 --> 00:07:54.383\nWe're not really making an money on this,\nbut\n\n161\n00:07:54.383 --> 00:07:59.017\nif you need to buy one of these you can\nbuy one certainly from them, right?\n\n162\n00:07:59.017 --> 00:08:02.980\nNotice, it says stop static build-up\nat your workstation, right?\n\n163\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.507\nStatic build-up is not something really\nthat so much so that you have to worry\n\n164\n00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:10.541\nabout, as much as it is the discharge of\nthe component, that's gonna happen, right?\n\n165\n00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:13.350\nThere's gonna be some kind of\ndischarge if you get static build-up.\n\n166\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.024\nBut what this does, is as the static\nbuilds up with your system, right,\n\n167\n00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:21.078\nyou put this wrist strap on, it's got\na little electric contact on the inside.\n\n168\n00:08:21.078 --> 00:08:26.201\nAnd what it does is it takes\nthat electrical contact that\n\n169\n00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:33.076\nmakes contact with your skin and\nthen you essentially have a little strap.\n\n170\n00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:36.850\nAnd the little strap piece of this, what\nit does is it has a little clip on it.\n\n171\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.448\nAnd that clip you clip to the bottom\nportion of the inside bare metal on\n\n172\n00:08:41.448 --> 00:08:43.204\nthe inside of the chassy.\n\n173\n00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:47.328\nAll right, and that takes any static\ncharge that's built up in your body and\n\n174\n00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:50.485\nthen like the handshake that I\nwas telling you that Zack and\n\n175\n00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:52.190\nI might do in the dryer months.\n\n176\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.726\nIt takes that electrical current and\nit dissipates it right to the chassy or\n\n177\n00:08:55.726 --> 00:08:57.192\nthe tower of the motherboard.\n\n178\n00:08:57.192 --> 00:09:00.288\nOr, not the motherboard,\nexcuse me, better not do that!\n\n179\n00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:02.343\nTo the case of the machine.\n\n180\n00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:05.045\nSo that's typically what we use.\n\n181\n00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.596\nWe use one of these wrist straps,\nESD wrist straps.\n\n182\n00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:13.208\nNow, the other thing that might\nhappen is you might find that\n\n183\n00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:18.013\nthe strap doesn't have a little\nalligator clip on it, right.\n\n184\n00:09:18.013 --> 00:09:20.721\nA little clip that clips that\nclips to the inside of the, again,\n\n185\n00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:22.086\nmake sure that it is unpainted.\n\n186\n00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:26.202\nYou wanna make sure that it is bare\nmetal cuz painted metal doesn't properly\n\n187\n00:09:26.202 --> 00:09:28.720\ndissipate the static charge to it and\nground.\n\n188\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.260\nSo make sure that it's bare\nmetal on the inside of the case.\n\n189\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.790\nBut sometimes, what you'll find is,\ninstead of having a alligator clip,\n\n190\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.700\nthey'll have a little snap.\n\n191\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.770\nWhat happens there?\n\n192\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.200\nWell, the snap is kinda interesting.\n\n193\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.971\nBecause what that gets connected to,\nare these, in fact, let me go ahead and\n\n194\n00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:43.908\nenlarge this too.\n\n195\n00:09:43.908 --> 00:09:45.675\nThis is one of these anti-static mats,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:47.310\nESD mats, as they call it.\n\n197\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.580\nNotice the little piece\nhere that you have, right?\n\n198\n00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.785\nAnd it depends on how these are done,\nall right.\n\n199\n00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:59.110\nYou could have them where the strap\nliterally connects to your wrist.\n\n200\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.411\nNo different than it does\nwith the alligator clip,\n\n201\n00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:04.954\nbut instead of having the alligator clip\nit has a snap that snaps to this table.\n\n202\n00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:09.835\nAnd it dissipates the any static charge\nin your body, not to the case, but\n\n203\n00:10:09.835 --> 00:10:11.115\nto the mat itself.\n\n204\n00:10:11.115 --> 00:10:15.311\nAnd these mats can be electrically\nresisted up to many, many,\n\n205\n00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:17.380\neven a million ohms or better.\n\n206\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.490\nI don't know if it actually tells,\nyeah, okay, there we go.\n\n207\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.390\nSo it kind of gives you the resistive\nnature of this right in\n\n208\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.950\nthe characteristics, and as you can see,\nthere's quite a few million ohms there.\n\n209\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.090\nAll right so again,\nthat's one of your ESD mats.\n\n210\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.740\nAnd Zach, depending on the different\ncharacteristic of the mat,\n\n211\n00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.340\nevery one of these will\nchange just a little bit.\n\n212\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.350\nHow electrically resistive it is.\n\n213\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.670\nJust, again like I said,\nyou can always come in here and\n\n214\n00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.180\nyou can pay attention\nto the ohms that it is.\n\n215\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.453\nAgain, the higher the number the higher\nelectrical resistance that it has.\n\n216\n00:10:48.453 --> 00:10:51.530\n&gt;&gt; Ohm.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be setting your components\n\n217\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.460\ndown on these mats and\nyou're gonna be working with them.\n\n218\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.690\nHonestly, sometimes,\n\n219\n00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.370\ndepending on what kind of\nthe component is, you might use both.\n\n220\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.230\nYou might use an anti-static bag.\n\n221\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.127\nI know one of the things that I kind of\ndo a lot of time is I'll use a mat and\n\n222\n00:11:04.127 --> 00:11:07.568\nI'll actually take the anti-static bag and\nI'll place the component on the mat,\n\n223\n00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:08.082\non the bag.\n\n224\n00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:11.308\nSome people might call me\na little bit paranoid.\n\n225\n00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:12.003\n&gt;&gt; A little overkill.\n\n226\n00:11:12.003 --> 00:11:16.987\n&gt;&gt; But I will tell you, it is something\nthat can protect what you're working with.\n\n227\n00:11:16.987 --> 00:11:22.969\nAnd I'll tell you what, you do have\nsometimes where you'll see people say,\n\n228\n00:11:22.969 --> 00:11:25.834\nhey, I don't use ESD wrist straps.\n\n229\n00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:28.012\nWell, that's okay,\nthat's not a bad technique,\n\n230\n00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:29.952\nthat's called self-grounding technique.\n\n231\n00:11:29.952 --> 00:11:33.578\nWhere you're just touching the inside\nof the case, rather than using\n\n232\n00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:37.525\nthe ESD wrist strap, you just touch\nthe bare metal on the inside of the case.\n\n233\n00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:41.070\nAnd that actually dissipates any\nstatic charge that's in your body.\n\n234\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.490\nBut however, keep in mind, that as you\nmove around, as you move side to side,\n\n235\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.620\nyou shuffle a little bit.\n\n236\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.778\nYour clothes, you're starting to generate\nstatic charge generation, right?\n\n237\n00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:55.805\nSo you're constantly building\nthat charge back up and\n\n238\n00:11:55.805 --> 00:12:00.161\nwhat happens is you still run the risk\nof potentially ruining the components.\n\n239\n00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:04.646\nSo you have to constantly keep dissipating\nthe electricity if you are using\n\n240\n00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:07.200\nself-grounding techniques.\n\n241\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.714\nThe story that I've heard.\n\n242\n00:12:07.714 --> 00:12:11.224\nI had a friend that,\nactually Don Pezet here.\n\n243\n00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:13.199\nHe is one of the hosts here.\n\n244\n00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.263\nOne of the subject matter experts.\n\n245\n00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:18.990\nHe's actually a master\nHP server technician.\n\n246\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.340\nHe's been that for a very long time.\n\n247\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.431\nAnd I asked him one time.\n\n248\n00:12:22.431 --> 00:12:26.250\nI said, do you use self grounding\ntechniques or do you use ESD wrist straps?\n\n249\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:26.964\nHe said, well,\n\n250\n00:12:26.964 --> 00:12:30.076\nI always take into consideration\nthe component that I'm working with.\n\n251\n00:12:30.076 --> 00:12:34.193\nIs depending on the component, depends\non how sensitive I'm gonna be to that.\n\n252\n00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:36.573\nLike I said,\nin relation to being paranoid.\n\n253\n00:12:36.573 --> 00:12:39.396\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; By putting this on top of the mat, and\n\n254\n00:12:39.396 --> 00:12:42.242\nthen the component on top\nof the anti-static bag.\n\n255\n00:12:42.242 --> 00:12:43.182\n&gt;&gt; Better be safe than sorry.\n\n256\n00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:47.235\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things he said is\nthat a lot of times he didn't wear an ESD\n\n257\n00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:48.039\nwrist strap.\n\n258\n00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:52.739\nBut then there would be times where he\nwas handling big old blocks of memory,\n\n259\n00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:54.140\nbig old memory banks.\n\n260\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.022\nAnd one of the memory banks could be\nanywhere from $30,000 to $70,000 for\n\n261\n00:12:58.022 --> 00:12:58.713\na single bank.\n\n262\n00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:02.306\nAnd he said then, at that point when I\nwas wearing two wrist straps, one for\n\n263\n00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:02.887\neach hand.\n\n264\n00:13:02.887 --> 00:13:03.513\nSo again,\n\n265\n00:13:03.513 --> 00:13:08.185\nyou have to take into consideration\nthe components that you're working with.\n\n266\n00:13:08.185 --> 00:13:11.370\nSometimes people just use\nself-grounding techniques, works fine,\n\n267\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.035\nI use that all the time when\nI'm working on computers here.\n\n268\n00:13:14.035 --> 00:13:17.840\nOther times,\nyou might be doing warranty work.\n\n269\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.700\nYou might have a company policy that says,\nhey, you have to be electrically grounded,\n\n270\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.387\nESD grounded.\n\n271\n00:13:22.387 --> 00:13:26.769\nSo pay attention to whatever\nyour company's policy is.\n\n272\n00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:27.580\nAll right, so\n\n273\n00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.779\nthe next thing that we have to talk\nabout is toxic waste handling, right?\n\n274\n00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:35.189\nWe talked about the components a little\nbit and how we protect the components.\n\n275\n00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:38.735\nThe next thing we have to talk about is\na little bit more environment friendly,\n\n276\n00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.007\nright, and\nhow we remain environment friendly.\n\n277\n00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:45.773\nBecause there are different components\ninside of our systems that could\n\n278\n00:13:45.773 --> 00:13:50.393\nhave a toxicity in them that we just\nhave to be aware of and cautious of.\n\n279\n00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:53.018\n&gt;&gt; Well now batteries I can understand,\nbut\n\n280\n00:13:53.018 --> 00:13:57.371\nwhat are some other toxic substances\nthat we might have to deal with.\n\n281\n00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:58.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zach you're right.\n\n282\n00:13:58.194 --> 00:14:00.804\nBatteries, like this one that I have here,\n\n283\n00:14:00.804 --> 00:14:03.641\nthese definitely we have\nto worry about those.\n\n284\n00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:05.022\nSometimes they're obvious.\n\n285\n00:14:05.022 --> 00:14:07.910\nBut things that aren't obvious\nsometimes like for instance, toner.\n\n286\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.850\nAnd you might not think if you\nhaven't been around it before.\n\n287\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.370\nMaybe this is the first time you're\ngetting into a computer technology.\n\n288\n00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.100\nBut toner inside of our laser printers,\nit's actually a toxic substance.\n\n289\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.770\nIt's a mixture of plastics and metals.\n\n290\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.802\nAnd what I want you to keep\nin mind is that, again,\n\n291\n00:14:26.802 --> 00:14:30.792\nit is toxic in the fact that you\ndon't wanna inhale this, right?\n\n292\n00:14:30.792 --> 00:14:35.578\nAs I'm talking about toner I wanna\nkinda talk about some of the personal\n\n293\n00:14:35.578 --> 00:14:40.524\nsafety measures that we have here because\nit is generally related to how we\n\n294\n00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:42.311\ndeal with toner, right?\n\n295\n00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:46.722\nToner is very, very interesting\nbecause if you look at toner,\n\n296\n00:14:46.722 --> 00:14:49.064\ntoner is very sensitive to heat.\n\n297\n00:14:49.064 --> 00:14:54.001\nAs part of the last part of\nthe laser print process is running\n\n298\n00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:57.360\nthat toner through fusion rollers, and\n\n299\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.730\nthe fusion rollers heat\nup to about 350 degrees.\n\n300\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.450\nAnd what they do is they melt\nthe plastics that are in the toner,\n\n301\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.820\nadhering that to the paper.\n\n302\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.380\nWell toner's so fine that when you get\nit on your hands it really makes a mess.\n\n303\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.790\nIt makes a really bad mess.\n\n304\n00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.109\nAnd your first thought is to go over and\nwash it off with soapy water.\n\n305\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.620\nWell, toner is so responsive to heat that\nthe process of heating it up with warm,\n\n306\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.140\nsoapy water could fuse it to your skin,\nall right.\n\n307\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.930\nSo you gotta double whammy there.\n\n308\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.920\nToxicity and\nthe fact that it's a nightmare to get off.\n\n309\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.620\nSo typically what you'll see\nis when toner cartridges,\n\n310\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.310\na lot of times what you'll have is\nyou'll have companies that will\n\n311\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.860\nactually when they mail you new toner,\nthey'll have a return label.\n\n312\n00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.957\nLike a return self-addressed\nlabel that allows you to put\n\n313\n00:15:46.957 --> 00:15:51.645\nthe old toner cartridge in the box,\nand just apply the label to it.\n\n314\n00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:54.304\nYou can ship it back to them and what\nthey'll do is they'll recycle it for you.\n\n315\n00:15:54.304 --> 00:15:56.608\nAnd they might refill it and\nresell it, I'm not exactly sure.\n\n316\n00:15:56.608 --> 00:16:00.692\nBut they're making some kind of, it's\nbeneficial but it's a mutual benefit and\n\n317\n00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:02.420\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n318\n00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.212\nHowever, if you are going to\nget rid of some cartridges,\n\n319\n00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:11.510\nyou should be looking at things like your\nlocal collection agencies right now.\n\n320\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.495\nCounting if you will with the city.\n\n321\n00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:17.790\nThe other thing we have to worry about or\nsee or team monitors.\n\n322\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.740\nNow CRT monitors really have\nbecome a thing of the past.\n\n323\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.820\nAnd the cathode ray tube monitors the big\nbulky monitors a lot of times, we have\n\n324\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.090\nLCDs at the very least and a lot of times\nLEDs screens very thin paneled monitors.\n\n325\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.190\nBut these CRT monitors that well,\nthey have a couple of things.\n\n326\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.610\nOne of the things they have is dangerous\nto you, the other is dangerous to\n\n327\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.480\nthe environment, is the fact that they\ncontain heavy metals, and when I say heavy\n\n328\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.487\nmetals, I'm not talking about Judas\nPriest, Pantera, Metallica and Megadeth.\n\n329\n00:16:45.487 --> 00:16:47.439\nWhat we're talking about are things-\n&gt;&gt; Poisonous.\n\n330\n00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:51.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very poisonous metals,\nvery caustic metals inside of them, and\n\n331\n00:16:51.435 --> 00:16:56.101\nit certainly isn't something that you just\nwanna just throw on the side of the road.\n\n332\n00:16:56.101 --> 00:16:57.562\nAnd let somebody else take care of it.\n\n333\n00:16:57.562 --> 00:17:00.895\nThe other thing I want you to\nunderstand too about CRT monitors,\n\n334\n00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:05.090\nis that they have capacitors in them that\nnot only containing the heavy metals.\n\n335\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.200\nIt can retain,\nwell think about what a capacitor does,\n\n336\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.070\nit retains an electrical charge.\n\n337\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.960\nWell those capacitors even after\nthe monitor has been turned off for\n\n338\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.040\nsix months, they can contain\nan electrical charge with enough amperage\n\n339\n00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.160\nthat when you touch it, it could stop\nyour heart and kill you instantly.\n\n340\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.589\nThey're not something you wanna throw.\n\n341\n00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.848\nI know a lot of people say, well I'll just\nthrow it on the outside of the dumpster\n\n342\n00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:29.488\nthere and we'll let somebody's\ngonna probably want it or not.\n\n343\n00:17:29.488 --> 00:17:32.038\nIt's not not something you want\nto do cuz I think like for\n\n344\n00:17:32.038 --> 00:17:34.491\ninstance I'm a parent,\nkids are very very curious.\n\n345\n00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:37.356\nI remember our sons always\nwanted to take things open,\n\n346\n00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:41.338\ntake things apart as kids in fact I\nstill do today and I'm 40 years old, but\n\n347\n00:17:41.338 --> 00:17:43.600\nyou don't wanna be responsible for that.\n\n348\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.341\nSome kid taking apart to CRT monitors and\nreaching in there and\n\n349\n00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:48.671\ntouching one of those capacitors and\nit kills them.\n\n350\n00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:51.060\nSo there's a dual thing there.\n\n351\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.750\nCRT monitors we'll have\nto worry about too.\n\n352\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:58.320\nYou might ask yourself well,\nwhere am I gonna get rid of these?\n\n353\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.476\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; How do we go about handle all that\n\n354\n00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:01.070\nstuff?\n\n355\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.740\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question in the fact that\nit really comes down to, they do call out\n\n356\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.200\non the exam objective compliance\nwith local government regulations,\n\n357\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.120\nbut there are multiple regulations.\n\n358\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.588\nRight.\nYou have Federal regulations\n\n359\n00:18:11.588 --> 00:18:12.827\non how you dispose of stuff.\n\n360\n00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:18.192\nYou have State regulations as well as\nLocal governments regulations too.\n\n361\n00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:21.440\nSo, let me go ahead and\ngive you guys an example here.\n\n362\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.310\nFor instance, I'm just gonna Google this,\nso we're live on camera here.\n\n363\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:31.260\nAnd what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n364\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.550\nwe'll type Gainesville and\nwe'll do hazardous.\n\n365\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.330\nWaste regulations or disposal.\n\n366\n00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:40.920\nCouple of things that you can do.\n\n367\n00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.750\nYou can do handling.\n\n368\n00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.990\nYou can do disposal and\nif I scroll down here,\n\n369\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.110\nyou'll see they're a lot\nof different options, but\n\n370\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.240\nthe one that I want here is first in\nthe list, hazardous waste collection.\n\n371\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.810\nAnd this just happens to be\nAlachua County, where we're located.\n\n372\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.430\nUnderstand, it's gonna be unique\nto whatever your location is, and\n\n373\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.330\nI don't care whether it's here\nin the United States here,\n\n374\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.660\nif you're on East Coast, if you're\non the West Coast, North, South or\n\n375\n00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.200\nif you're in another country,\nit's gonna be whatever is local to yours.\n\n376\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.500\nCuz keep in mind, that we're\ngonna have different regulations\n\n377\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.330\nobviously here in the United States,\nthan you will have in the EU.\n\n378\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.150\nIn the European nations as well.\n\n379\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.540\nBut if I scroll down here,\n\n380\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.360\nwe can see all different types of\nthings that can be collected right?\n\n381\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.197\nElectronic scrap including TVs,\nmonitors and computers.\n\n382\n00:19:24.197 --> 00:19:27.809\nMercury containing bulbs, fluorescent,\nthat's another thing with the CRTs.\n\n383\n00:19:27.809 --> 00:19:32.485\nThey have what are known as CCFLs\ncalled cathode fluorescent lamps.\n\n384\n00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:35.322\nAnd I wanna say that you can go in here,\n\n385\n00:19:35.322 --> 00:19:39.159\nand you can get more specific\ninformation as well.\n\n386\n00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:43.259\nBut keep in mind that for us here,\nwe're talking about free of charge, right?\n\n387\n00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:47.160\nAnd they've got all kinds of things,\nlike for instance, computer electronics.\n\n388\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.840\nAnd this is important,\nlet's see if this actually comes up.\n\n389\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.630\nActually, I'm not gonna wait for\nit there too.\n\n390\n00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.080\nBut anyways,\nyou could see that we can just call them.\n\n391\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.290\nWe can find out what are the things\nthat you can use or what are the things\n\n392\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.050\nthat you can't take, maybe there are\ncertain things that you can't take there.\n\n393\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.980\nBut you can always check those\nlocal regulations, right?\n\n394\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.878\nThe local regulations,\nthe local collection agencies a lot of\n\n395\n00:20:09.878 --> 00:20:14.800\ntimes will have programs in place in\norder to dispose of this properly.\n\n396\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.035\n&gt;&gt; Which is a wonderful thing.\n\n397\n00:20:16.035 --> 00:20:17.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n398\n00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:20.480\nAll right, so some of the other\nthings that we've got to talk about.\n\n399\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.730\nI know we're coming to\nthe end of this one as well.\n\n400\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.120\nPersonal safety,\nthis is the one that's important right?\n\n401\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.550\nThey've all been important.\n\n402\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.300\nDon t get me wrong.\n\n403\n00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.545\nThey've all been important, but remember\nI don't care what the component is,\n\n404\n00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:34.845\nyou need to take care yourself.\n\n405\n00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:39.393\nYour company should have some kind of\nsafety guidelines on how you do that,\n\n406\n00:20:39.393 --> 00:20:41.426\nbecause you cannot be replaced.\n\n407\n00:20:41.426 --> 00:20:44.100\nComponents, I don't care\nif there are $100,000.\n\n408\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.700\nThey can be replace, you cannot.\n\n409\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.490\nI want you to remember,\n\n410\n00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.350\nevery time you work on a computer\ncomponent disconnect the power source.\n\n411\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.930\nAll right.\n\n412\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.790\nWhen it comes to things like the power\nsupply, not only disconnect it from\n\n413\n00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.740\nthe power source but\npress the power button in and hold it in.\n\n414\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.700\nA lot of times what you'll see is you'll\nend up seeing that the light will come on\n\n415\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.950\nand it will slowly dissipate away.\n\n416\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.990\nIt's one of the things you need to do.\n\n417\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Now under personnel safety,\nsee electrical fire safety.\n\n418\n00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.720\nI'm pretty sure we would not handle\nan electrical fire the same way we'd\n\n419\n00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720\nhandle a grease fire\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n420\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.850\nYou know, for instance,\nworking in the kitchen before,\n\n421\n00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.270\nI've been in restaurant in and\nout throughout my life.\n\n422\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.390\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that we would do,\n\n423\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.030\nif it was a grease fire as we typically\nfind some kind of baking soda,\n\n424\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.970\nsome kind of powdered agent\nthat we'd throw on and\n\n425\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.180\ntry to put it out, obviously not using the\nwater because that just accelerates it.\n\n426\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.700\nIt turns it into an inferno.\n\n427\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.750\nWell like you've mentioned, I mean\nelectrical fires are gonna be different.\n\n428\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.720\nSo one of the things that we have to keep\nin mind is that there's a couple of ways\n\n429\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.230\nthat you can tackle electrical fires.\n\n430\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.900\nElectrical fires,\n\n431\n00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.220\none of the things that you gonna\nis you can remove all the oxygen.\n\n432\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.550\nIf I pull all the oxygen out\nright what does that do?\n\n433\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.910\nWell, that essentially removes the source.\n\n434\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:05.990\nFires can't survive without oxygen but the\nproblem is with that, neither can humans.\n\n435\n00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.190\n[LAUGH] So in older days.\n\n436\n00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.070\nMaybe one of the things you might\ndo is remove all the oxygen from\n\n437\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.700\nthe room, right?\n\n438\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.480\nBut you have to make sure that people have\ntheir masks on first while you also have\n\n439\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.030\non of those class C fire extinguishers,\nand class C fire extinguishers in a way\n\n440\n00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.910\nessentially that you can\nput out an electrical fire.\n\n441\n00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.310\nWithout removing the oxygen,\n\n442\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.900\nwithout killing the people in the room,\nused to be that you could use halon.\n\n443\n00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.571\nHalon is prohibited, and in fact,\n\n444\n00:22:32.571 --> 00:22:38.365\nI think the only industries that really\nuse Halon at all anymore is aviation.\n\n445\n00:22:38.365 --> 00:22:41.616\nAviation type fires can still use,\nI believe, and\n\n446\n00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:44.414\nif you guys are following\nalong out there and\n\n447\n00:22:44.414 --> 00:22:48.739\nany of you guys are part of our\nUnited States military, let us know.\n\n448\n00:22:48.739 --> 00:22:51.139\nLet us know in our forums.\n\n449\n00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:55.961\nI'm pretty sure the aviation industry is\nthe only ones that can really use what\n\n450\n00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:58.540\nlast bits or stores of Halon that we have.\n\n451\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.310\nIt's pretty much gone by the wayside,\nbut I know class C fire extinguisher and\n\n452\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:06.950\nthat's the way, essentially the way you're\ngoing to tackle an electrical fire today.\n\n453\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.870\nOne of the things that you can also\ndo is remove the electrical source\n\n454\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.430\nif that's a possibility as\nwell just by killing the fuse,\n\n455\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.250\nkilling the power to whatever\nthe fire source might be.\n\n456\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.790\nRemoving jewelry, that is important.\n\n457\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.870\nKeep in mind, dangling objects, especially\nif we talk about things like gold,\n\n458\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.710\nyou guys that like the bling out there,\n\n459\n00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.620\nmight be a time to put it\naway from your tech bench.\n\n460\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.510\nBecause remember, gold and\nplatinum, things like this, silver,\n\n461\n00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:36.150\nthey're very good conductors\nof electrical current.\n\n462\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.233\nWhich means you could be the path of least\nresistance, you could be the ground point.\n\n463\n00:23:40.233 --> 00:23:43.081\nThe other thing too,\nis that you have moving parts.\n\n464\n00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:45.683\nMoving parts,\nagain fans in there [CROSSTALK].\n\n465\n00:23:45.683 --> 00:23:47.546\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n466\n00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:50.066\n&gt;&gt; They don't mention this\none ladies out there, and\n\n467\n00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:54.050\nI hope you guys have long hair out\nthere and ladies put your hairs back.\n\n468\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.123\nPull your hair back,\nkeep it out of your way.\n\n469\n00:23:57.123 --> 00:24:01.452\nBecause these fans, some of these\nfans move at 2,100 RPMs and beyond.\n\n470\n00:24:01.452 --> 00:24:03.820\nI've seen some of the CPU fans.\n\n471\n00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.430\nAnd if you're working around\nservers that have multiple fans,\n\n472\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.560\nyou don't want to scalp yourself.\n\n473\n00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.760\nYou don't wanna pull your hair\nliterally right off your body.\n\n474\n00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.840\nSo keep your hair back, right?\n\n475\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.045\nWe've got plenty of ladies out\nthere that are techs as well too.\n\n476\n00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:17.510\nSo you certainly wanna make sure\nyou get your hair out of the way.\n\n477\n00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.638\nPull it up on a bun,\nuse pony tail holders if you have to.\n\n478\n00:24:19.638 --> 00:24:22.635\nUse the old, like my wife does,\nwrap it around in a bun and\n\n479\n00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:24.326\nput a pencil it in if you have to.\n\n480\n00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:27.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But just do not let it hit those moving\n\n481\n00:24:27.605 --> 00:24:31.160\nparts inside of the components\non your circuitry.\n\n482\n00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.700\nLifting techniques.\n\n483\n00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.390\nAll right,\nlifting techniques is another one.\n\n484\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.490\nAssess the equipment that\nyou're gonna move, all right?\n\n485\n00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.430\nKnow your limits.\n\n486\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.320\nKnow your strengths.\n\n487\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.500\nKnow your weaknesses, right?\n\n488\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:47.380\nYou don't have to be the person that is\ntrying for the strong man competition,\n\n489\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.028\nbecause sometimes you can tell\njust how heavy a component is.\n\n490\n00:24:52.028 --> 00:24:52.947\nI'll give you an example of this.\n\n491\n00:24:52.947 --> 00:24:56.631\nWhen you're in a server closet, right, you\nnotice this little rack mount server and\n\n492\n00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:59.000\nit's only about four inches thick.\n\n493\n00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.786\nWell, what you don't realize is that it's\n19 inches wide, it could be 3.5 feet long,\n\n494\n00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:10.761\nand they're could be 128 CPUs with\nmetal heat sinks on top of it.\n\n495\n00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:13.169\nIt could weigh a couple hundred pounds,\nand\n\n496\n00:25:13.169 --> 00:25:15.520\npull that out of that server rack, right?\n\n497\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.334\nAnd then you no longer have any\nassistance from that server rack,\n\n498\n00:25:18.334 --> 00:25:21.247\nand now you have to figure out,\nare you gonna throw your back out, or\n\n499\n00:25:21.247 --> 00:25:23.310\nare you gonna drop a $200,000 server?\n\n500\n00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.433\n&gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong\nwith a buddy lift.\n\n501\n00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:26.002\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n502\n00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:28.241\nUsing lifting techniques.\n\n503\n00:25:28.241 --> 00:25:30.640\nI'm glad you mentioned it Zach,\nthat's right.\n\n504\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.340\nThe buddy technique.\n\n505\n00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.615\nMake sure that you've got somebody there.\n\n506\n00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:36.680\nProper stacking techniques too.\n\n507\n00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.422\nIf you've got a dolly,\nif you've got a floor cart.\n\n508\n00:25:38.422 --> 00:25:40.972\nA floor cart is one of the best\nthings that you can have,\n\n509\n00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:44.645\nbecause it eliminates a lot of the strain\nthat you're gonna have on your back.\n\n510\n00:25:44.645 --> 00:25:47.175\nBecause even if you\nare using one of the dollys,\n\n511\n00:25:47.175 --> 00:25:49.625\nyou still have to maintain some balance,\nas well.\n\n512\n00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:51.345\nSo also know that too.\n\n513\n00:25:51.345 --> 00:25:52.895\nWeight limitations, again.\n\n514\n00:25:52.895 --> 00:25:55.555\nThings like that, no weight limitations.\n\n515\n00:25:55.555 --> 00:25:57.905\nBecause for instance,\nwhen you look at things like server racks.\n\n516\n00:25:57.905 --> 00:25:59.426\nThose of you that move out of maybe.\n\n517\n00:25:59.426 --> 00:26:03.179\nJust the traditional A plus level and\nmaybe you move into networking, maybe you\n\n518\n00:26:03.179 --> 00:26:07.335\nmove into the Security+, the Server+, you\nstart to move into data centers, right?\n\n519\n00:26:07.335 --> 00:26:11.163\nOne of the things that we do is we have to\nknow the weight limits of the server rack\n\n520\n00:26:11.163 --> 00:26:12.950\nthat you're stacking, right?\n\n521\n00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.290\nYou're putting the most heavy\nequipment on the bottom, and\n\n522\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.230\nthen the lighter equipment\ntowards the top.\n\n523\n00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.970\nBecause what people don't realize is\nthat a fully stacked 42U server rack.\n\n524\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.470\nIf it falls down on you,\nwe're not talking about broken bones.\n\n525\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.410\nWe're talking about you don't\nwalk out of that server closet,\n\n526\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.380\nunless you're in a body bag.\n\n527\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.680\nI know that sounds very, very dark, but\n\n528\n00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.350\nyou just have to understand\nyou cannot be replaced.\n\n529\n00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.800\nThat's why when they stack in\ndata centers, in fact it goes so\n\n530\n00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.620\nmuch so\nthat you have to worry about floor weight.\n\n531\n00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.280\nOne of my friends talked about\nworking at a bank in Seattle and\n\n532\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.480\nthey were in a high rise.\n\n533\n00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.400\nAnd they have enough servers that were\nbrought into their data center that\n\n534\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.360\nthey were pushing the limits of the floor\nload, literally of the whole floor.\n\n535\n00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.620\nSo again, know the weight limitation.\n\n536\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.010\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right\n&gt;&gt; Cable management,\n\n537\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.810\ncable management is very, very important.\n\n538\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:11.940\nRemember the rat's nest?\n\n539\n00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.910\nUsing things like, for instance,\nwe can't see them here off the stage, or\n\n540\n00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.310\noff the camera here in the studios.\n\n541\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.515\nWe actually have cable protectors that\nare set over cables that are running\n\n542\n00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:25.735\nalong the floor, so we don't trip on them.\n\n543\n00:27:25.735 --> 00:27:30.875\nOur directors do a very good job of\ntrying to keep us hosts and SME subject\n\n544\n00:27:30.875 --> 00:27:34.935\nmatter experts safe here, so they've put\nalmost looks like a speed bump, right?\n\n545\n00:27:34.935 --> 00:27:37.765\nAnd it just lays over the cables,\nso it's a tripping hazard.\n\n546\n00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:40.561\nRemember that's one of\nthe beauties of wireless.\n\n547\n00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:43.321\nRoute around the outside if you can,\nand if you can't go wireless.\n\n548\n00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:48.250\nThat's one of the beauties\nof unbounded communications.\n\n549\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.090\nProper cable management though,\nuse your cable trays if you can.\n\n550\n00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.400\nA lot of your desks have cable trays\nthat you can do cable management.\n\n551\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.188\nYou also have cable\nprotectors that you can use,\n\n552\n00:27:58.188 --> 00:28:00.982\nsheathing that goes around\nyour cables as well.\n\n553\n00:28:00.982 --> 00:28:05.636\nRun your cabling around the exterior\nof your walls if you can.\n\n554\n00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:08.856\nIf you have drop cables that\ncome from the wall to your PCs,\n\n555\n00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:12.410\nmake sure that they're tucked\nbehind the high traffic areas.\n\n556\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.660\nIf nothing else,\n\n557\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.470\nI've done this before where I've\nhad to set up a conference room.\n\n558\n00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.800\nLast minute, we didn't have anything,\nI had a roll of duct tape, it's fine.\n\n559\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.280\nThere's nothing wrong with\nrolling some duct tape out, and\n\n560\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.510\nliterally duct taping cable\nto the high traffic areas,\n\n561\n00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.630\nso that you make sure that\npeople don't trip, right?\n\n562\n00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.500\nOne of the biggest things you can do when\nit comes to things like cable management,\n\n563\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.180\nelectrical, fire safety,\nweight limitation,\n\n564\n00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.300\neverything that's on this list.\n\n565\n00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.170\nLifting techniques,\nbe aware of your environment.\n\n566\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.960\nBe aware of what's around you,\ncuz awareness,\n\n567\n00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.880\nif you're aware of something,\nthen you can start to take precautions.\n\n568\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.120\nIf you're not aware of your environment,\nyou don't even know that it's there.\n\n569\n00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.460\nThat's when things start to cause problems\nand definitely cause safety issues.\n\n570\n00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.380\nSafety goggles is another\nthing you might have to wear.\n\n571\n00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.578\nMaybe not, depends on what you're doing.\n\n572\n00:29:01.578 --> 00:29:05.865\nI know that our facilities manager here,\nour property manager, he wears safety\n\n573\n00:29:05.865 --> 00:29:10.475\ngoggles for almost just about every job\nthat he does, how little, how big it is.\n\n574\n00:29:10.475 --> 00:29:13.313\nBecause again,\nyou don't want your eyes to be damaged.\n\n575\n00:29:13.313 --> 00:29:19.892\nAir filter mask, this really has to\ndo with things like toner, all right?\n\n576\n00:29:19.892 --> 00:29:21.852\nWhen you're cleaning up\ntoner you have filter,\n\n577\n00:29:21.852 --> 00:29:26.372\nyou have vacuums that have toner filters\nin them to make sure that the toner,\n\n578\n00:29:26.372 --> 00:29:31.262\nbecause it has such fine particles in it,\nyou don't want it to automatize and\n\n579\n00:29:31.262 --> 00:29:33.712\nmake its way into the air, and\nthen you're breathing it in.\n\n580\n00:29:33.712 --> 00:29:35.250\nCuz remember, it's metal.\n\n581\n00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.397\nAll right, we breathe that in,\nit hits the moisture in your lungs,\n\n582\n00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:40.512\nwhat happens to metal\nwhen it hits moisture?\n\n583\n00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:41.616\nOxidizes, right?\n\n584\n00:29:41.616 --> 00:29:43.352\nYou don't want red oxidation\nin your lungs, right?\n\n585\n00:29:43.352 --> 00:29:44.680\nYou get rusty lung.\n\n586\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.780\nSo things like air filter\nmasks can come in handy,\n\n587\n00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.270\nspecifically when you're working\naround things like toner.\n\n588\n00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.950\nSo those are some of the things\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n589\n00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.720\nRemember, be aware of your environment.\n\n590\n00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.030\nTake the safety procedures.\n\n591\n00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.340\nTake the safety precautions.\n\n592\n00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.280\nBe aware of what's around you,\nand you can keep yourself safe.\n\n593\n00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.512\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great advice.\n\n594\n00:30:03.512 --> 00:30:06.142\nSafety procedures, CompTIA A+ 902,\n\n595\n00:30:06.142 --> 00:30:10.462\nthere's a whole bunch of videos\nin this series of CompTIA A+ 902.\n\n596\n00:30:10.462 --> 00:30:14.380\nYou've gotta see them all and\nyou'll be glad you

00:00:08.155\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:11.094\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.998\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.299\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.463\nI'm your host Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA A+ 902 series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:27.223\nIn this particular episode, we're looking\nat environmental impact and controls.\n\n9\n00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:30.319\nAnd the person giving us the information\nwe need is the one and the only Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.220\nThere he is, you see him,\nyou love him, you know him.\n\n11\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.682\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:37.175\nThat's right, we're gonna be talking\na little bit about the environment, or\n\n13\n00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:40.405\nat least some of the things that we have\nto worry about in computing that can\n\n14\n00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:41.850\nimpact the environment.\n\n15\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.905\nAnd we'll definitely look at\nenvironmental controls, really,\n\n16\n00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:46.059\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n17\n00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.399\nAnd there are some things\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n18\n00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.233\nNow, we said environmental impact,\nwell, what that means, obviously,\n\n19\n00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:57.689\nthat there are things that are inside\nof your computing environment,\n\n20\n00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:01.410\nthat could have a detrimental\naffect on the environment.\n\n21\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270\nNow, I will tell you that it's\nnot only IT, if you will here.\n\n22\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.910\nSo some of the concepts we'll see, you'll\nprobably even see things like food safety.\n\n23\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.060\nWe talk about food safety courses, if\nthis happened to be a food safety course,\n\n24\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.380\nyou might see some of\nthese things here as well.\n\n25\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.080\nIf you've ever worked in restaurants,\n\n26\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200\nyou'll probably see some\nof the same concepts.\n\n27\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.429\nSo I want you to understand that, well,\n\n28\n00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.642\nwhile some of these things are unique\nto IT, not everything is unique to IT.\n\n29\n00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:31.428\nSome of these have a commonality across\nmultiple countries, if you will,\n\n30\n00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:33.121\nas well as multiple industries.\n\n31\n00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.228\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're not just talking about a clean room,\n\n32\n00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.800\nwe're talking about\na complete environment.\n\n33\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.272\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are, so, and\nthat's a good starting point, so\n\n34\n00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:46.041\nwe're talking about things like,\nhow do we handle different chemicals?\n\n35\n00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:47.252\nHow do we handle and\n\n36\n00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:51.958\ndispose of different substances that\nmight be within our environments?\n\n37\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.776\nHere at ITProTV, there are times where\nwe have to go over to our server closet,\n\n38\n00:01:56.776 --> 00:02:00.871\nand we have to replace,\nwe'll have things like battery backups.\n\n39\n00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.470\nWhich, we're gonna talk a little\nbit more about batter backups and\n\n40\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.707\nwhat they actually mean for us.\n\n41\n00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:09.043\nAs far as protecting from things like\npower surges, brown-outs, if you will,\n\n42\n00:02:09.043 --> 00:02:09.759\nblackouts.\n\n43\n00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.453\nBut what I wanna look at is,\n\n44\n00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:16.670\nwhat the environmental impact of\nthe batteries that are in battery backups?\n\n45\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.866\nNow, you have to understand that, when we\ntalk about a battery backup type system,\n\n46\n00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:25.452\nwe're talking the potential to have 12,\n20, 30,\n\n47\n00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:29.208\n60, 100 batteries the size\nin motorcycle batteries.\n\n48\n00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:32.959\nVery heavy, especially the more\nbattery backups you have, so\n\n49\n00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.170\nwe have to replace those batteries.\n\n50\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.300\nIt is, like any other battery,\nthey have a shelf life, and\n\n51\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.240\ntheir life cycle, span, if you wiill,\nis only going to be so far.\n\n52\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.120\nWhether it's a year, whether it's\nthree years, four years, five years,\n\n53\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.270\nat a certain point, we're gonna\nhave to replace those batteries.\n\n54\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.670\nSo what do we do,\nhow do we handle the batteries,\n\n55\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.810\nhow do we properly\ndispose of the batteries?\n\n56\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.249\nBut that's not the only thing,\n\n57\n00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.922\nthere are other chemicals that\nyou have to worry about too.\n\n58\n00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:04.656\nWe talked about in A+, one of the things\nwe mentioned in our networking section is\n\n59\n00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:08.140\nthe difference between things like\nplenum and non-plenum grade cabling.\n\n60\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.940\nPlenum grade cabling is cabling that\nhas the plastic sheathing around it.\n\n61\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.942\nThe protective jacket\naround the outside of it,\n\n62\n00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:17.095\nwhen burnt, doesn't give off a toxic gas.\n\n63\n00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:21.666\nNon-plenum is essentially polyvinyl\nchloride, and polyvinyl chloride,\n\n64\n00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:23.781\nwhen burnt, gives off a toxic gas.\n\n65\n00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:28.032\nAnd when inhaled, could cause harm to,\nwell, never mind the environment, but\n\n66\n00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:30.660\nthe people that are within\nthat environment.\n\n67\n00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.530\nSo there are things that we have to\nkeep in mind that we need to know about.\n\n68\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.868\nAnd that's where someone\nknown as the MSDS comes in,\n\n69\n00:03:37.868 --> 00:03:41.822\nthe material data safety sheet,\nif I can remember.\n\n70\n00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:48.263\n[LAUGH] MSDS, now, when we talk about\nthe material safety data sheet,\n\n71\n00:03:48.263 --> 00:03:52.750\nsome of you are probably\naware of this out there.\n\n72\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.004\nThat is a term that I really think that\nCompTIA's just kinda done a copy and\n\n73\n00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.651\npaste between the exam objectives.\n\n74\n00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.519\nAs it's gone through,\nback when I started at 501, I think,\n\n75\n00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.610\nand now we're 601 and 701.\n\n76\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.521\n&gt;&gt; Back in the old days.\n\n77\n00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:10.793\n&gt;&gt; That's right, now we're up to 901.\n\n78\n00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:14.809\nAnd some of you are probably aware\nthat it is no longer called MSDS,\n\n79\n00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:18.050\neven though it's most\ncommonly recognized as MSDS.\n\n80\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.015\nAnd in fact, when I was working\nin the restaurant industry,\n\n81\n00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:24.440\nwe always said, where's the MSDS?\n\n82\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.590\nWell, it's now called\nthe safety data sheet, the SDS.\n\n83\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.221\nSafety data sheet, make I get my acronym\nright, yeah, it's called the SDS today.\n\n84\n00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:37.613\nAnd I want you to understand that\nyou are studying for this exam, and\n\n85\n00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:42.468\nyou go out and you look for MSDS, and\nit keeps saying safety data sheet, and\n\n86\n00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:45.660\nyou're like, what What the heck is that?\n\n87\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.393\nWell, that's cuz they actually updated the\nstandards, and it's no longer called MSDS.\n\n88\n00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:54.570\nIt's called safety data sheet,\nbut content is gonna be the same.\n\n89\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.670\nAnd for the exam, I want you to know and\nunderstand a little bit about the MSDS.\n\n90\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.625\nAnd again,\nthat's what they call it on the exam,\n\n91\n00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:06.270\nthey call out MSDS documentation for\nhandling and disposal.\n\n92\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.920\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n93\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.670\ntalk about a little bit of the things that\nyou could find inside of this material\n\n94\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.720\nsafety data sheet, MSDS from here on out.\n\n95\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.023\nThe MSDS has a lot of different things,\none of the things that it has is,\n\n96\n00:05:17.023 --> 00:05:19.679\nwell, things like, first of all,\nfirst aid measures.\n\n97\n00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:25.450\nPreventative measures, handling,\nhow do we handle hazardous substances?\n\n98\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.970\nAnd what I mean by that,\nit could be as simple as a cleaner.\n\n99\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.292\nI remember one of the things that we\nused to have common to just about every\n\n100\n00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:34.418\ndifferent restaurant that I worked\nin was some kind of degreaser.\n\n101\n00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now it always had these colorful names.\n\n102\n00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:41.193\nAnd I quite literally mean colorful names,\nit'd be called Green Monster in one,\n\n103\n00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:42.770\nit'd be called Purple Tiger.\n\n104\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.149\nAnd if you guys work for that company out\nthere, I'm not trying to endorse you or\n\n105\n00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:47.472\nsteal your thunder in any way.\n\n106\n00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.098\nBut I believe in one, it was green, it was\na green substance, it was degreaser, and\n\n107\n00:05:51.098 --> 00:05:52.490\nit was called, Green Monster.\n\n108\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.590\nAnd then in another company, they had a\ndegreaser, and it was called Purple Tiger.\n\n109\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.950\nWell, what's the difference between them,\nthey're both degreasers.\n\n110\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.890\nWell, there could be\na considerable difference, and\n\n111\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.077\nthat's where the MSDS comes in.\n\n112\n00:06:05.077 --> 00:06:09.264\nBecause a degreaser is a degreaser,\nmaybe to some, but the way you handle and\n\n113\n00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:12.228\nyou work with degreasers\ncould be a bit different, and\n\n114\n00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:14.100\nyou have to be aware of that.\n\n115\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.640\nSo, MSDS can have things like\nproduct information in it, and\n\n116\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.950\nthat's important, and\nwhy is that important?\n\n117\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.410\nLet's say something goes wrong,\nGod forbid something goes wrong.\n\n118\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.170\nWe want you guys to be safe out there,\nwe have stressed that in other episodes,\n\n119\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.460\nyou guys and\ngals out there cannot be replaced.\n\n120\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.022\nEverything you work with can be,\nI don't care how expensive it is,\n\n121\n00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:36.343\nyou can't be replaced.\n\n122\n00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:39.429\nSo let's say the worst case scenario,\n\n123\n00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:44.198\nsomething happens, and\nyou have to call Poison Control, or\n\n124\n00:06:44.198 --> 00:06:49.390\nyou have to go to the hospital,\nwell, what'd you get on you?\n\n125\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.245\nI got this purple junk on me,\nI got this purple stuff, I don't know,\n\n126\n00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:54.720\nwe use to clean the grill.\n\n127\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.679\nOkay, so what is it, purple junk,\nthat really doesn't help people.\n\n128\n00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:04.270\nSo I want you to think about in another\nsituation, if you get bit by a snake,\n\n129\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.760\nchances are, you're gonna wanna know\nwhat kind of snake you got bit by.\n\n130\n00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.268\nBecause there's gonna be\na different antivenom for\n\n131\n00:07:10.268 --> 00:07:12.915\ncoral snakes versus\na rattlesnake versus a moccasin.\n\n132\n00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:18.018\nAnd I don't know biology by any means,\nor geology, whatever that falls under,\n\n133\n00:07:18.018 --> 00:07:21.332\nI don't know any of it,\nany of the -ologies [LAUGH].\n\n134\n00:07:21.332 --> 00:07:25.462\nBut there's gonna be a difference between\ntreating something that affects your\n\n135\n00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:28.196\nbloodstream versus something that,\na neurotoxin,\n\n136\n00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:29.971\nthat affects your neural system.\n\n137\n00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:32.311\nAnd you need to know that,\nit's gonna save your life.\n\n138\n00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:35.711\nSo it's good to have product\nidentification, because I need to know,\n\n139\n00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:37.818\nyou need to know, paramedics need to know.\n\n140\n00:07:37.818 --> 00:07:42.236\nPeople that come in and they basically\nclean up, how you properly clean up,\n\n141\n00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:44.640\nif there's a spill or leakage.\n\n142\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.150\nSo product identifier is something that\nusually goes in with the product niche.\n\n143\n00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.842\nThe manufacturer,\nwho is the manufacturer of the substance?\n\n144\n00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:57.492\nThat's really good, because then you can\nalways call the manufacturer too, and say,\n\n145\n00:07:57.492 --> 00:07:59.778\nhey, I need a little bit\nmore information about this.\n\n146\n00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:02.863\nI mean, we're not placing\nblame on the manufacturer.\n\n147\n00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:07.230\nBut, I know it's purple tiger, I know\nit's made by this person, this company.\n\n148\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.550\nGotta call that company up,\nDoctor Scan or whatever, and chances are,\n\n149\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.350\nif they're already a registered\ncompany like that,\n\n150\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.070\nthings like Poison Control already have\nthe information because a lot of those\n\n151\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.039\ncompanies have to submit that information\nas part of the MSDS to be included in it.\n\n152\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.160\nSo now you make yourself\na little bit more aware.\n\n153\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.750\nWho's your supplier?\n\n154\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.260\nMight have supplier information, could\nhave an address, could have things like\n\n155\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.340\nemergency phone numbers with it as well,\nall the product information.\n\n156\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.370\nWhat's the physical data?\n\n157\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.830\nNow this might not be something that's\nimportant to you and that's okay.\n\n158\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.910\nI just know that it cleans grills\nI just know that it makes that\n\n159\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.480\nmonitor shinning once I get done.\n\n160\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.350\nI noticed that it takes off the glare\nof the monitor once I clean it off.\n\n161\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.250\nI noticed that it takes dust out of\nthe machine once I'm done with it.\n\n162\n00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.690\nThat's what I know, but\n\n163\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.100\nwhat I might need to know it's a little\nbit more about the physical data itself,\n\n164\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.430\nand that's the information that's also\nincluded there because it is important in\n\n165\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:06.090\nan emergency situation to have Additional\ninformation about the chemical compound.\n\n166\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.530\nBecause we talked bout things,\nlet's take another substance,\n\n167\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.610\nwell it's not really a substance, well,\nI mean I guess it is a substance, but\n\n168\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.480\nhow I react to fire is a lot\ndifferent between a grease fire and\n\n169\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.690\nelectrical fire, between a chemical\nfire and an electrical fire.\n\n170\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.740\nRight, depleting oxygen\nversus putting a powder,\n\n171\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.910\nversus putting something that's non-toxic,\nversus something that extinguishes\n\n172\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.360\nthe oxygen which also kills\nthe people in the room, right.\n\n173\n00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.100\nSo you're reaction to a fire is gonna\nbe different based on what it is.\n\n174\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.280\nSo you have to know what\ntype of fire it is and\n\n175\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.750\nyou have to know what type\nof fire extinguisher to use.\n\n176\n00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.520\nAnd likewise, you have to know what\nthe chemical is that you're using\n\n177\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.830\nBecause the reaction's gonna be different.\n\n178\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.120\nSo what are the hazardous ingredients?\n\n179\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.580\nWhat are the chemicals that\nare the makeup of it, if you will?\n\n180\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.130\nSo it could be hazardous ingredients,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.926\nIs it explosive?\n\n182\n00:09:55.926 --> 00:10:00.210\nI don't know, Zach, I don't know about\nyou, I know you've done some travelling as\n\n183\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.291\nwell, I've done some road travelling,\nor just around town, right?\n\n184\n00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.040\nPropane, uh-oh here we go.\n\n185\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.750\nPropane, we gotta talk about propane.\n\n186\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.300\nPropane truck's going down the road and\n\n187\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.060\nthe first thing you see is the little\nflammable symbol in the back, right?\n\n188\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.600\nOr it's an 18 wheeler that one of\nthe things they do is they work for\n\n189\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.550\na shipping company.\n\n190\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.510\nAnd not every 18 wheeler,\nif you will, or the rig,\n\n191\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.610\nthe cab, is gonna be hooked up\nto the same trailer, right?\n\n192\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.230\nSo what do they have?\n\n193\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.170\nThey have multiple flipped\nlittle flip boards, right?\n\n194\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.260\nToday, we're carrying sailboat fuel.\n\n195\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.050\nWhich means we're empty, we're caring air\nnothing and I have to worry about right\n\n196\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.400\nbut tomorrow we could be carrying propane\ntomorrow at the day after that we could be\n\n197\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.210\ncarried oil day after that we could be\ncarrying milk Now a little bit different.\n\n198\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.290\n&gt;&gt; More coffee.\n&gt;&gt; It's specialized, right?\n\n199\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.780\nMore coffee, there we go.\n\n200\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.550\nSo you understand,\nwe have to be aware of that.\n\n201\n00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.230\nSo is it a fire hazard,\nis it explosive hazard, right?\n\n202\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.610\nIs it a caustic corrosion hazard?\n\n203\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.240\nIs it something that,\n\n204\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.055\nif I spill on the floor, I'll come back\nand the floor will be gone, right?\n\n205\n00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:06.580\n[LAUGH] It might not be molecular\nacid like in the Aliens movies,\n\n206\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.780\nbut again you do have to be aware, too.\n\n207\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.830\nWhat what is the reactivity, right and\nit is that information there too alright.\n\n208\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.600\nIt isn't stable, it got instability in it.\n\n209\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.590\nToxicology right one\nof the health effects.\n\n210\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.600\nThe burning of the skin\na rash right blinding.\n\n211\n00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.360\nDo you have to get to\nthe eye wash immediately?\n\n212\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.410\nDon't induce vomiting.\n\n213\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.800\nI'm not trying to be gross.\n\n214\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.570\nI'm trying to be serious in\nthe fact that there are some things\n\n215\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.130\nthat you have to know.\n\n216\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.580\nWhat are the preventative measures?\n\n217\n00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.660\nWhat are the appropriate\nhandling measures?\n\n218\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.440\nWhat are the first aid measures in order\nto treat something if you come in contact\n\n219\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.420\nwith this stuff?\n\n220\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.390\nHow do we contain This stuff.\n\n221\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.990\nHow do we clean it up?\n\n222\n00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.670\nAnd more importantly,\nhow do we dispose of it, right?\n\n223\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.370\nBecause, again,\nit's about the environment as well.\n\n224\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.155\nSo, all of this is important, right.\n\n225\n00:11:55.155 --> 00:12:00.008\n[NOISE] These are some of the things that\nyou will find in the material safety\n\n226\n00:12:00.008 --> 00:12:00.878\ndata sheet.\n\n227\n00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:06.066\nUnderstand again today SDS is\nwhat it's called if you're out\n\n228\n00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:11.265\nthere researching it and\nwant a little bit more information.\n\n229\n00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:15.455\nAlright, that is a little bit-- a lot\nof bit I should say, about the MSDS.\n\n230\n00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:18.655\nNext thing we have to talk about is\nwhat-- They talk about temperature,\n\n231\n00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:22.120\nhumidity awareness and\nproper ventilation, alright.\n\n232\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.910\nIs environmental controls.\n\n233\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.480\nWhen we talk about environmental controls\nwe are not talking about the EPA,\n\n234\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.970\nwell I guess we could be in\nsome situation, but not here.\n\n235\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.220\nWhat we're talking about,\nthink about our server closets,\n\n236\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.830\nnow that's one of the things\nyou wanna keep in mind too.\n\n237\n00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.260\nIf we're in our server closets, what is\nthe temperature of the server closet?\n\n238\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.050\nYou need to make sure that relative\nhumidity in the server closet is somewhere\n\n239\n00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.340\nbetween 65 and 70%, why?\n\n240\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.182\nWell because the higher the humidity,\nthe more moisture we have in the air.\n\n241\n00:12:51.182 --> 00:12:55.430\nThe more moisture we have in the air the\nmore tendency we have for condensation.\n\n242\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.760\nThe more condensation we have in\na system the more likely we are for\n\n243\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.210\nan electrical fire.\n\n244\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.580\nAn electrical short circuit, right?\n\n245\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.040\nCondensation's water, right?\n\n246\n00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:10.160\nThe opposite side of the spectrum\nis Last in 65% humidity.\n\n247\n00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.150\nWe have dryer, right?\n\n248\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.100\nWe've taught about dryer.\n\n249\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.380\nWe've taught about the winter months.\n\n250\n00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.360\nThe dryer leads to a static charge\ngenerations that a charge generation leads\n\n251\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.840\nto electrostatic discharge\nwhich Destroys your components.\n\n252\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.850\nSo you have to have humidity level\nawareness and this is why a lot of your\n\n253\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.120\nclimate control systems that you have in\nareas where they have a lot of computer\n\n254\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:36.010\nequipment will have readouts that let\nyou know what is the relative humidity.\n\n255\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.380\nNow if you're at a tech bench where\nyou're doing a lot of tech work,\n\n256\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.120\nyou might have that.\n\n257\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.730\nIf you have a dedicated area, right?\n\n258\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.350\nYou mentioned cleaning room a few times\nthroughout the night on two series, Zach.\n\n259\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n260\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.680\n&gt;&gt; They have temperature control\nsystems in the cleaning rooms.\n\n261\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.550\nThey also have environmental\nmonitoring systems that you can see and\n\n262\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.350\nmaybe even adjust.\n\n263\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.540\nRight, if you're talking about dry,\ndry air, and too dry of air,\n\n264\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.410\nthey might have a humidifier in there.\n\n265\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.460\nIf you're talking too much humidity,\nlike we had in certain areas where I used\n\n266\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.720\nto paint and do commercial painting,\nwe'd have a de-hu, a de humidifier.\n\n267\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.700\nWe'd have to put a de-hu right in the\nmiddle of the room to suck all the water\n\n268\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.690\nin [LAUGH] I just saw the paint.\n\n269\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.900\nThe paint would dry.\n\n270\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.110\nYes, sir, right?\n\n271\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:17.360\nSo you can see that that's not\nsomething that you just find inside of\n\n272\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.120\na server closet.\n\n273\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.860\nBut when you have hundreds of thousands\nof dollars of electrical equipment,\n\n274\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.350\nor even $1,000 of electrical equipment,\nit is important.\n\n275\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.200\nAll right, so\nhumidity level awareness is important.\n\n276\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.730\nTemperature.\nTemperature is the other thing, too,\n\n277\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.550\ncuz remember thermal\ntemperature management,right?\n\n278\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.420\nThermal management is one of the most\nimportant things that you could do cuz\n\n279\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:41.130\nit's also one of the most detrimental\nthings that can happen to a computer.\n\n280\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.940\nThat's why we have system fans,\nthat's why we have heat sinks,\n\n281\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.980\nthat's why we have our cooling systems,\nright.\n\n282\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.930\nSo you have to make sure that the ambient\ntemperature in the room stays colder too.\n\n283\n00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.100\nA lot of times the colder the better.\n\n284\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.260\nSometimes even so\ncold that you can't stand it and\n\n285\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.480\nhave to wear a sweater\nis even better as well.\n\n286\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.200\nRight\n&gt;&gt; I've experienced that\n\n287\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Most days, so yes, well,\n\n288\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.580\nI'll give you an example there Zack.\n\n289\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.770\nOne of the things I do is that I,\nlike to jog at lunch time, right.\n\n290\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.930\nSo one of the things, the first thing I do\nto cool down is that I go into the server\n\n291\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:09.640\ncloset\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n292\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n293\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.920\nServer closet is 68 to 69 degrees, and\n\n294\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.430\nit stays that way\n&gt;&gt; That's right\n\n295\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, the cooler the better.\n\n296\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.260\nWe talk about cool you wanna make\nsure that your systems stay cool, so\n\n297\n00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.330\nyou have make sure that\nthe temperature control is there.\n\n298\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.460\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Proper ventilation is important too.\n\n299\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.760\nAll right, and proper ventilation is also\nmaking sure that we're you know vacating\n\n300\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.060\nany moisture Making sure that,\nagain, we've got a good balance.\n\n301\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.500\nIt's the same thing,\nthink about it on a smaller scale, too.\n\n302\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:45.940\nWhen you talk about, for instance,\nyour cases, your towers.\n\n303\n00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.060\nWe have a pull/push system,\nyeah, pull/push system right?\n\n304\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.380\nAnd what I mean by that is\non the ATX motherboards,\n\n305\n00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.270\nthe ATX form factor,\nwe pull air in to the system.\n\n306\n00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.482\nHeat rises and\nthen we exhaust it out the back.\n\n307\n00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:02.468\nAnd we have to have the right ratio to\nmake sure that we're maintaining and\n\n308\n00:16:02.468 --> 00:16:04.862\nthe cooling system keeps everything cool.\n\n309\n00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:06.112\nWell that's why you need ventilation.\n\n310\n00:16:06.112 --> 00:16:09.495\nYou need ventilation in your server\nclosets cuz you need that circulation, and\n\n311\n00:16:09.495 --> 00:16:10.590\nit's important.\n\n312\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.830\nThe other thing that you\nneed good circulation for\n\n313\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.723\nis things like airborne particles, right,\nand that's something that they also call\n\n314\n00:16:16.723 --> 00:16:20.655\nout as protection from airborne particles,\nthey talk about things like enclosures.\n\n315\n00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:24.410\nAll right, enclosures as well\nas air filters and masks,\n\n316\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:29.356\nnow be careful with this cuz airborne\nparticles they don't call this out.\n\n317\n00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:32.348\nAnd let me just double check on this,\nno they don't call this out, but\n\n318\n00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:35.596\nyou really should have these too and\nthose are air ionizers, all right, and\n\n319\n00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:36.494\nlet me tell you why.\n\n320\n00:16:36.494 --> 00:16:40.927\nOkay, most climate control systems,\na lot of them I'm not saying most,\n\n321\n00:16:40.927 --> 00:16:45.645\na lot of them have air filters, well\nhere's the problem with the air filters,\n\n322\n00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:47.575\nthe air filters collect dust and\n\n323\n00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:52.399\nif people forget to service them what\nhappens to the dust that collects on them?\n\n324\n00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:56.491\nIt gets so heavy it makes its way back\ninto the same location that you're trying\n\n325\n00:16:56.491 --> 00:17:00.397\nto pull it out of, right, which is why\nproper ventilation is important but\n\n326\n00:17:00.397 --> 00:17:04.100\nventilation doesn't happen\nwhen the filters get clogged.\n\n327\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.550\nAnother thing that happens with the\nfilters too when they get dirty is they're\n\n328\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.140\nreally prone to mold and\nmildew, and again that in itself\n\n329\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.350\ncan become an environmental hazard,\nright, that's why air ionizers are very,\n\n330\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.940\nvery good for\nthings like climate control systems.\n\n331\n00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.211\nAnd the reason I say that is because I\nused to call shenanigans on air ionizers\n\n332\n00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:23.699\nuntil I kinda learned\nwhat they were doing.\n\n333\n00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:27.315\nSo air ionizers, what are they doing,\nwell positive ions, all right,\n\n334\n00:17:27.315 --> 00:17:31.110\nand I am not your science teacher here,\nBill Nye eat your heart out, right,\n\n335\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.847\nI am not your science teacher here you\ngo listen to brilliant minds like Neil\n\n336\n00:17:34.847 --> 00:17:37.794\ndeGrasse and all of them,\nthey can help you out with this.\n\n337\n00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:41.655\nBut from what I understand positive ions\nare where our dust particles come from,\n\n338\n00:17:41.655 --> 00:17:45.514\nright, that's essentially what it is, and\nwhat an air ionizer does is it forces\n\n339\n00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:48.671\nnegative ions into the room,\npositives and negatives attract.\n\n340\n00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:53.129\nAnd what it does is it doesn't prevent\ndust-borne particles, but what it does is\n\n341\n00:17:53.129 --> 00:17:57.136\nwhen the positives and negatives\nattract it makes those positives ions,\n\n342\n00:17:57.136 --> 00:18:00.884\nthose dust-borne particles, so\nheavy they fall to the ground, and\n\n343\n00:18:00.884 --> 00:18:05.472\nthen they can be cleaned with traditional\nmethods like cloths, brooms if you will,\n\n344\n00:18:05.472 --> 00:18:06.734\nelectronic vacuums.\n\n345\n00:18:06.734 --> 00:18:10.039\nRight, make sure they're electronic\nvacuums, you don't wanna use just\n\n346\n00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:13.501\na 1.5 horse Shop-Vac, right, too much\nstatic charge will lead to a static\n\n347\n00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:17.190\ncharge in addition to electrostatic\ndischarge, it's not something we wanna do.\n\n348\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.064\nSo vacuums are good too and they call\nit out just generically vacuums, but\n\n349\n00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:25.562\nuse the right vacuum, use an electronics\nvacuum that doesn't have a static charge,\n\n350\n00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:29.270\nthe motor doesn't produce ESD,\nelectrostatic discharge, right.\n\n351\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.792\nMasks, masks are for\nyou more than anything, all right, so\n\n352\n00:18:34.792 --> 00:18:36.160\nyes you can use masks.\n\n353\n00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.872\nAnd here let me tell you why mask is\nimportant because I'm gonna use mask with\n\n354\n00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:42.776\nthe next topic that we have to talk about,\ndust and debris.\n\n355\n00:18:42.776 --> 00:18:45.975\nAll right, dust and debris gets in\nsystems, that's just the way it is,\n\n356\n00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:47.451\nit's not a matter of if, right.\n\n357\n00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:51.331\nI was talking to our director of\nproduction, right, and he's an engineer,\n\n358\n00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:55.094\nhe's a technical engineer, and\nhe's talking about hardware failure and\n\n359\n00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:58.377\nhe goes I'm an engineer so\nit's not a matter of it's gonna fail,\n\n360\n00:18:58.377 --> 00:19:01.930\nit's It's just a matter of when,\ngreat statement cuz that's true.\n\n361\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.791\nAnd that's true with everything in\ncomputing today let alone some of\n\n362\n00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:07.454\nthe video production equipment\nthat we have behind the scenes,\n\n363\n00:19:07.454 --> 00:19:09.395\nit's not a matter of if\nit's a matter of when.\n\n364\n00:19:09.395 --> 00:19:12.162\nSo same thing goes with dust, it's not\na matter of if you're gonna get dust in\n\n365\n00:19:12.162 --> 00:19:14.674\nthe system, it's just a matter of\nhow long it's gonna take, right,\n\n366\n00:19:14.674 --> 00:19:16.189\nwhen are you gonna get dust in the system?\n\n367\n00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:20.893\nWell I want you to think about\nwhat that dust does to a fan,\n\n368\n00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:25.893\nI have seen dust seize an industrial\nceiling fan, seize it,\n\n369\n00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:29.929\nseize it tight, why,\nwell cuz it accumulates.\n\n370\n00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:33.450\nWell think about you going in there and\nblowing that thing off,\n\n371\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:38.038\nmaybe with a compressor if you will, or\nif you're talking about your computers or\n\n372\n00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:41.561\nblowing it with some compressed air,\nright great things, but\n\n373\n00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:43.780\nwhat you are turning around and doing?\n\n374\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.020\n&gt;&gt; Breathing it back in.\n\n375\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Breathing that stuff right\nback into your system, right, so\n\n376\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.445\nthat's why masks are also important.\n\n377\n00:19:49.445 --> 00:19:53.030\nNow you might say well Wes, that's hooey.\n\n378\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.980\nNow this isn't something for the exam but\nI want you to know one of the things that\n\n379\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.670\nI'll do is I'll take a fan, even if\nit's a desktop fan, not a desktop fan, I\n\n380\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.249\nmean literally a desktop mounted fan, not\na desktop fan, that would be like okay,\n\n381\n00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:06.360\nwell just take your fan out-\n&gt;&gt; A people fan.\n\n382\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.040\n&gt;&gt; A people fan, that's right,\ngreat way to put it, Zach.\n\n383\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.860\nAnd I'll actually put that at the end of\nthe tech bench and I'll turn it on high,\n\n384\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.110\nand when I do I stand to the side and\nI use compressed air and\n\n385\n00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:20.450\nas it blows the dust up in the air\nit sends it out of my area, right.\n\n386\n00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.520\nEven worse, or\n\n387\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.450\nnot worse [LAUGH] even better than that,\nif you're using compressed air to take\n\n388\n00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.440\ndust out of a system I actually take it\noutside, as many components as I can,\n\n389\n00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.170\nyou can't just take a 200 pound server off\nthe rack and take it outside potentially.\n\n390\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.840\nBut blow that stuff away from your face\nand if you have to wear a mask, wear some\n\n391\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.030\nkind of respirator, right, it's not stuff\nthat you wanna get into your lungs and\n\n392\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.620\nwant rolling around in your lungs, so\nyou also have to keep that in mind too.\n\n393\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.615\nNow they take about power surges,\nbrownouts and blackouts.\n\n394\n00:20:50.615 --> 00:20:52.580\nA power surge, a spike in electricity,\n\n395\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.620\nright, temporary spike in electricity\nwhich means there's more voltage in\n\n396\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.900\nthe line than should be there,\nthat can ruin circuitry.\n\n397\n00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.530\nRemember, our circuitry works on direct\ncurrent, it doesn't do good with frequency\n\n398\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.160\nvariations which is why it doesn't\nrun off of alternating current.\n\n399\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.740\nRight, we have bridge rectifiers.\n\n400\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.210\nAnd the rectifier essentially\ndoes kind of a conversion, and\n\n401\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.480\nwhat it does is it takes\nalternating current and\n\n402\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.120\nit changes it into direct current and it\nfeeds the power to our computer circuitry.\n\n403\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.123\nWell, when you talk about plugging\nbasically a power supply into\n\n404\n00:21:24.123 --> 00:21:28.785\nan alternating current there's still\nalternating current going into that\n\n405\n00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:33.733\npower supply and a fluctuation if you\nwill, a frequency variation in the power,\n\n406\n00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:36.570\ncould cause some kind of\ndamage to the system,\n\n407\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.967\nthat's why we wanna understand\nwhat a power surge is.\n\n408\n00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:45.162\nBrownouts are temporary low power\nevents that happen, right, a brownout.\n\n409\n00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:48.393\nSometimes the only way you know a\nbrownout, and I don't know if you've seen\n\n410\n00:21:48.393 --> 00:21:51.845\nthis and I know you've lived in Florida\nfor a while Zach so I know you've seen it.\n\n411\n00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:55.612\nThe only time sometimes you even know that\na brownout happens is when the lights\n\n412\n00:21:55.612 --> 00:21:59.669\nflicker, right, because lights are very\nsensitive to electrical current changes\n\n413\n00:21:59.669 --> 00:22:03.404\nAnd if they kinda dim a little bit that's\nusually when you can see a brownout.\n\n414\n00:22:03.404 --> 00:22:07.990\nCuz it's temporary low voltage happening\nif you will event, versus a blackout,\n\n415\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.722\nwe know when a blackout's out, blackouts\nis just electrical that is gone, right.\n\n416\n00:22:12.722 --> 00:22:13.833\n&gt;&gt; Lights out.\n\n417\n00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.441\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, lights out, I love it [LAUGH].\n\n418\n00:22:15.441 --> 00:22:17.683\nYeah, lights on, lights out, right.\n\n419\n00:22:17.683 --> 00:22:20.533\nSo we have to worry about\nsituations like that, right, and\n\n420\n00:22:20.533 --> 00:22:23.725\nwe have to protect our systems from\nthese frequency variations and\n\n421\n00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:27.393\nlights out conditions, like Zach to\ncoin a phrase there from Zach, right?\n\n422\n00:22:27.393 --> 00:22:29.655\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's where battery backups come\n\n423\n00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:30.974\nin, and surge suppressors.\n\n424\n00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:33.410\nHowever keep in mind\nthat a surge suppressor\n\n425\n00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:38.297\nis really only as good as the one you pay\nfor, because it's really more like a fuse.\n\n426\n00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:43.440\nA surge suppressor receives enough of,\nI think it's cold clamping voltage,\n\n427\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.530\njoules I think it is, but the cold\nclamping voltage, it receives enough\n\n428\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:51.020\nvoltage and it trips whatever the fuse or\nthe breaker switch is in it.\n\n429\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.530\nHowever I will tell you that if lightning\nhits it, and lightning goes down\n\n430\n00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.260\nthe current and it hits that surge\nsuppressor lightning does what it wants,\n\n431\n00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.810\nit's gonna find the path of least\nresistance, it could jump, right.\n\n432\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:07.380\nSo understand those are only as good as\nthe money that you invest in them, and\n\n433\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.540\nunderstand that there's not really a lot\nthat can stop things like lightning\n\n434\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.625\noutside of the line\nsuppressors if you will,\n\n435\n00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:19.650\nwhere they'll actually pop a complete\ncircuit within the inside of the building\n\n436\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.730\nitself rather than what\nthe computer's connected to.\n\n437\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.216\nBattery backups, right, these are called\nuninterruptible power supplies and\n\n438\n00:23:27.216 --> 00:23:29.880\nyou got a couple different types\nthat I wanna make mention of,\n\n439\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.075\nand I know we're running\nup on time on this one.\n\n440\n00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:34.765\nWe got a couple different\ntypes of battery backups,\n\n441\n00:23:34.765 --> 00:23:37.393\nfirst of all understand what\na battery backup is and\n\n442\n00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:41.934\nthen we're gonna talk about what it's used\nfor and what it's not used for, all right.\n\n443\n00:23:41.934 --> 00:23:46.342\nSo a battery backup, an uninterruptible\npower supply, there's an online and\n\n444\n00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:50.115\nan offline battery power supply,\nuninterruptible power supply.\n\n445\n00:23:50.115 --> 00:23:53.301\nThey're calling it battery backup,\nthat's more generic, it's called a UPS and\n\n446\n00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:55.498\nthat's usually what we see\nwhen we buy them, all right.\n\n447\n00:23:55.498 --> 00:24:00.052\nSo an offline UPS, uninterruptible\npower supply, what does that do?\n\n448\n00:24:00.052 --> 00:24:03.796\nWell it means you plug your devices\ninto it and once we have a blackout,\n\n449\n00:24:03.796 --> 00:24:07.411\na lights out situation again,\nAll right, that means it comes on and\n\n450\n00:24:07.411 --> 00:24:09.331\nit provides power to your systems.\n\n451\n00:24:09.331 --> 00:24:12.170\nThat's offline, why is it called offline?\n\n452\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.090\nIt's also called a standby as well.\n\n453\n00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.650\nBecause it isn't providing\npower to your systems\n\n454\n00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.910\nuntil there's a lack of the power\nfrom the AC outlet, right?\n\n455\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.820\nThat's why it's offline or standby.\n\n456\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.240\nThen you have an online power supply.\n\n457\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.157\nAnd an online power supply is one that it\nalways supplying power to your systems,\n\n458\n00:24:31.157 --> 00:24:34.600\nwhether you have power in\nthat AC outlet or not, right.\n\n459\n00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.110\nSo if I have everything plugged into that\nonline UPS, uninterruptible power supply,\n\n460\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.060\nand we still have power to\nthe building guess what?\n\n461\n00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.720\nI'm still getting the power\nfrom the batteries.\n\n462\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.630\nNow why would I use one over the other?\n\n463\n00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.950\nAll right, either way,\nwhichever one you pick.\n\n464\n00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.180\nThis is why I wanna say, understand what a\nUPS is and then now let's understand what\n\n465\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.950\nyou use it for, what you don't use it for\nand the choices that you have why\n\n466\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.140\nyou would make a choice over one or\nthe other, all right?\n\n467\n00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.770\nWhat don't you use a UPS for?\n\n468\n00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.830\nTo provide power to your systems and\ntell the power is restored.\n\n469\n00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.390\nThat's not what it's for.\n\n470\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.550\nIt's never what a UPS is for.\n\n471\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.339\nA UPS is used for to provide your\nsystems with just enough time\n\n472\n00:25:16.339 --> 00:25:20.502\nto perform a graceful shutdown\nrather than a critical kernel power\n\n473\n00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:24.612\nfailure because you have a blackout,\nlights out like Zach said.\n\n474\n00:25:24.612 --> 00:25:27.528\nAnd your computers are in the middle\nof a write to the hard drive and\n\n475\n00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:30.140\nyou have data corruption and\nit can't recover from that.\n\n476\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.060\nSo usually what you do is you have your\nsystems, what you'll see is indefinitely\n\n477\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.560\nwhen you had UPSs stacked,\na UPS connected to the UPS and\n\n478\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.690\nthey start going one at a time,\nall of your systems are triggered to shut\n\n479\n00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:46.410\nthemselves down in succession in sequence\nwithin a certain amount of time, right?\n\n480\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.080\nYour UPS might only give you\na half hour at best, sometimes.\n\n481\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.230\nSometimes only a half hour, right,\nand you'll start hearing alarms.\n\n482\n00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.370\nAnd you can hear them,\nthey're loud in some of the UPSs.\n\n483\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.490\nYou hear the alarms start triggering, it's\nlike you know those batteries are drained.\n\n484\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.670\nAnd your systems shut down one by one.\n\n485\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:05.010\nNow, the online UPS versus the offline,\n\n486\n00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.610\nor standby UPS,\nwhy would you buy one or the other?\n\n487\n00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.610\nHere's the consideration, all right?\n\n488\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.580\nOffline or standby UPSs are typically\nfound inside of home environments and\n\n489\n00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.730\nthey're usually a little bit cheaper,\na lot of bit cheaper.\n\n490\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.470\nBattery watt life, all right?\n\n491\n00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.190\nBecause you're not supplying power from\nyour battery until the AC current is lost,\n\n492\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.821\nthe batteries last longer.\n\n493\n00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.108\nBatteries are expensive, so\n\n494\n00:26:28.108 --> 00:26:32.804\nthey last longer because they're\nonly online when the power is lost.\n\n495\n00:26:32.804 --> 00:26:34.346\nAll right, however,\n\n496\n00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:39.310\nhere's where they lose some functionality\nthat your online UPS gives.\n\n497\n00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.699\nThey don't give line conditioning.\n\n498\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.710\nNow let me talk about the online UPS,\n\n499\n00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.640\nand I'll mention line conditioning in\nthe fact that's what an online UPS does.\n\n500\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.280\nOnline UPS, remember we said it provides\npower at all times from the batteries\n\n501\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.090\nwhether you have power or not or there's\na black out or not on your systems.\n\n502\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.890\nWhat that means for\nus is that I get line conditioning.\n\n503\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.570\nWhy?\n\n504\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:09.060\nSince the power is coming\nfrom a good direct current,\n\n505\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.070\nclean direct current from the batteries at\nall times, I don't care about blackouts,\n\n506\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.320\nI don't care about brownouts,\nI don't care about surges.\n\n507\n00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.340\nWhy?\n\n508\n00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.050\nCuz none of that surge that's coming off\nthe AC line is going directly into my\n\n509\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.620\nsystems at all, cuz I'm getting\nthe power from the batteries and\n\n510\n00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.760\nthe batteries are always a nice\nclean even direct current.\n\n511\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.090\nI get line conditioning and\nthat's great, no frequency variations.\n\n512\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.225\nGotta be something's bad, all right?\n\n513\n00:27:32.225 --> 00:27:33.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, something is bad,\n\n514\n00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.460\nis they're expensive,\n\n515\n00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.770\nwhy you typically find them inside\nof enterprise level environments.\n\n516\n00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:42.810\nAnd the other thing is because you're\nalways supplying juice from the battery,\n\n517\n00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.820\nwhat do you think that does\nto the battery's life span?\n\n518\n00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.230\n&gt;&gt; Gonna replace them once in a while.\n\n519\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.970\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\n\n520\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.570\nYes sir.\n\n521\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.240\nYou hit the nail on the head there Zach.\n\n522\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.470\nThe battery's life is usually a lot less\nthan what the standbys are, all right.\n\n523\n00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.950\nSo, couple of differences.\n\n524\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.000\nLike I said,\nthey just call them battery backups.\n\n525\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.660\nBut understand, it isn't wait\ntill your power comes back up.\n\n526\n00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.220\nIt's just to perform graceful shutdowns.\n\n527\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:10.000\nNow, in this episode we've been talking\na lot about environmental impact and\n\n528\n00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.930\ncontrols.\n\n529\n00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.880\nThe last thing I wanna mention, probably\nshould've been one of the first things\n\n530\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.830\nI should've mentioned,\nis every bit of this is\n\n531\n00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.960\ngoing to have to be in compliance\nwith local government regulations.\n\n532\n00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.860\nNow that's all they call out here.\n\n533\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n534\n00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.398\n&gt;&gt; That's all I call out here\non the exam objectives, but\n\n535\n00:28:25.398 --> 00:28:29.397\nunderstand you have federal regulations,\nyou have state regulations and\n\n536\n00:28:29.397 --> 00:28:31.492\nyour local government regulations and\n\n537\n00:28:31.492 --> 00:28:35.510\nall of them need to be adhered to,\nright, not just what CompTIA is saying.\n\n538\n00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:40.140\nSo make sure that from\na business standpoint, right,\n\n539\n00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.750\nfrom a non-exam standpoint, that you\nare checking with those regulations.\n\n540\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.140\nAnd then make sure that if you do,\nyou might not even have the decision.\n\n541\n00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.060\nBut be aware of them, so that you maybe\ncan inform your company or that you aware\n\n542\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.580\nof them just in general so that you fall\ninto compliance with the environmental\n\n543\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.660\ncontrols and the impact that you\ncould have on your local community.\n\n544\n00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.640\nAgain, national level,\nstate level, local level as well.\n\n545\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.170\nKeep in mind, keep yourselves protected.\n\n546\n00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.100\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job as usual, Wes.\n\n547\n00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.738\nEnvironmental impact and\ncontrols CompTIA A+ 902.\n\n548\n00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:19.975\nThere's a whole bunch of video in this\nseries, make sure you watch them all.\n\n549\n00:29:19.975 --> 00:29:23.075\nWes does a wonderful job, and\nI know you agree with me.\n\n550\n00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:25.245\nAnd hey, thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n551\n00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:27.805\nRemember, good IT pro is always learning.\n\n552\n00:29:27.805 --> 00:29:28.705\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n553\n00:29:28.705 --> 00:29:29.575\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.401\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.148\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:14.901\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\nchoosing ITPRO.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:17.260\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.960\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA A+ 902,\n\n8\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.880\nand guess who's bringing\nus the information we need?\n\n9\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.740\nThe one,\nthe only Wes Bryan right over here.\n\n10\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.818\nWes, how you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:30.782\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing great,\ngreat to be back here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:35.650\nAnd that is right here, we are continuing\nalong with our 220-902 series.\n\n13\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.063\nWe're gonna be kinda deviating away\nfrom some of the fun stuff we've been\n\n14\n00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:39.679\nlooking at.\n\n15\n00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.011\nWe've been looking at\nthings like our software,\n\n16\n00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.243\nwe've been talking about\noperating systems.\n\n17\n00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:48.491\nAnd I guess we're not going too far out of\nsoftware, we're still kinda hand in hand,\n\n18\n00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.630\nbut we're gonna really look at\nmore operational procedures.\n\n19\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.480\nSo if you guys are following along, guys\nand gals out there are following along\n\n20\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.990\nwith us, we are in Domain 5.0 talking\nabout operational procedures.\n\n21\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.495\nAnd more specifically, we're gonna\nbe looking at privacy concepts.\n\n22\n00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:06.140\nWe're gonna be looking at licensing\nconcepts, as well as policy concepts, and\n\n23\n00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.950\nit is important.\n\n24\n00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.890\nNow, I couldn't get the actual\nobjectives in our title here.\n\n25\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.020\nWe try to do that so\nyou guys can follow along with us and\n\n26\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.580\nyou can know where we're at here.\n\n27\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.700\nBut there's pretty much,\n\n28\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.440\nin this sort of objective title here,\nit's almost like a master's thesis.\n\n29\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.340\nSo let's go ahead and let you guys and\ngals know out there, this is 5.3.\n\n30\n00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.160\nSummarize the process of\naddressing prohibited content and\n\n31\n00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.970\nactivity, prohibited activity if you will,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.330\nexplain privacy licensing and\npolicy concepts.\n\n33\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.980\nThat is what we're gonna\nbe looking at today.\n\n34\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.690\nNow keep in mind, when we talk about\nprohibited content and activities.\n\n35\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.470\nThere's stuff that comes to mind,\nI'm sure, the moment I say that.\n\n36\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.500\nWhen we talk about not safe for\n\n37\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.960\nwork, things that shouldn't\nbe in the workplace, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.540\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that\neverything, when we talk about prohibited\n\n39\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.190\nactivity or prohibited conduct,\nreally falls under that category, right?\n\n40\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.770\nThere are definitely federal regulations,\nfederal laws, but there's also state to\n\n41\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.680\nstate regulations, as well as local,\ncounty regulations as well.\n\n42\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.470\nSo, for instance, not every state\nprohibits online gambling, right?\n\n43\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.530\nSo online gambling in certain states,\nit's absolutely fine, right?\n\n44\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.330\nBut that doesn't mean it's fine for\nyour company.\n\n45\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.790\nIt doesn't mean that you could use company\n\n46\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.220\nresources to view and\nuse things like that, right?\n\n47\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.510\nI want you to think of\nthings like social media.\n\n48\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.320\nSocial media isn't particularly a bad\nthing, I mean, it can be a bad thing.\n\n49\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.017\nBut just like anything else in\nany digital media situation or\n\n50\n00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:45.288\ninformation system,\nit can have its goods and bads.\n\n51\n00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:47.650\nFrom a marketing standpoint\nsocial media can be amazing.\n\n52\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.020\nYou take a product and you can get it out\nto 500,000 people within minutes, right?\n\n53\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.742\nBut at the same time, you could take that\nsame 500,000 people and you can release\n\n54\n00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.962\ndocumentation that really should have\nbeen kept internal to the company and\n\n55\n00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.690\nnever should have hit the social media.\n\n56\n00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.550\nSo even things like that could be\nprohibited content and activity.\n\n57\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.390\nSo, again, I don't want you to think just\nnecessarily that it has to be those sites\n\n58\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.492\nand those activities that we know,\nwhether you're at work or\n\n59\n00:03:14.492 --> 00:03:18.350\nwhether you're at home, you shouldn't be\ntaking part, that are against the law.\n\n60\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.120\nWe're also talking about\nthe policy aspect of it, right?\n\n61\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.952\nBecause we have talked in other\nepisodes about things like AUPs,\n\n62\n00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:26.561\nacceptable use policies.\n\n63\n00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.980\nWhat is an acceptable use policy?\n\n64\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.523\nWell, they come in many\ndifferent shapes and sizes,\n\n65\n00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:32.225\nthey come in many different forms.\n\n66\n00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:36.715\nAn acceptable use policy just says,\nhey, company's got resources and\n\n67\n00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:40.330\nwhat is the adequate,\nwhat is the expected utilization?\n\n68\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.660\nWhat is the proper\nutilization of that resource?\n\n69\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660\nIt could be something as\nsimple as a wireless network.\n\n70\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.300\nIt could be something like a company\ncomputer, could be a public kiosk.\n\n71\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.635\nSo this doesn't necessarily mean that\nit could just be internally to your\n\n72\n00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:53.428\ncompany and your internal employees.\n\n73\n00:03:53.428 --> 00:03:56.590\nIt could be your customers walking\nthrough the front door that have public\n\n74\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.500\naccess to that kiosk computer and\nthey're logging into it as well.\n\n75\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.942\nAnd you have some kind of acceptable\nuse policy there as well.\n\n76\n00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.080\nThink about public libraries, right?\n\n77\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.370\nPublic libraries, they usually give you\nsome kind of public access to their\n\n78\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.710\nnetwork, their wireless network, both,\nor even their public computers, right?\n\n79\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.030\nBut even they have\nacceptable use policies.\n\n80\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.370\nSo those are some of the things that\nwe have to look at when we dive\n\n81\n00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.910\ninto privacy, license, policy.\n\n82\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.700\nLicense, now what are we talking\nabout when we say license?\n\n83\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.380\nWell, this is going back to software,\neven though we're not\n\n84\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.840\ntalking about hands-on working\nwith the software at this point.\n\n85\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.884\nBut what we're talking about is\nhow you acquire that software and\n\n86\n00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:36.388\nhow you utilize that software.\n\n87\n00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:39.526\nWhether it be from a personal standpoint,\na small office,\n\n88\n00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:43.607\nhome office, right up to something like\na corporate environment in which you\n\n89\n00:04:43.607 --> 00:04:45.920\nmaybe need thousands of license, right?\n\n90\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.610\nHow do the license apply?\n\n91\n00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.750\nSo we're gonna look at things like that.\n\n92\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.720\nAnd then, really when it comes down to it,\nall of this will be policy-driven.\n\n93\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.690\nSome kind of formal statement to your\ncompany or by your company to customers,\n\n94\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.620\nto employees,\n\n95\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.390\nto even the employers themselves on\nwhat is their responsibility as well.\n\n96\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.030\nBecause you really need responsibilities\nthat are clearly defined for\n\n97\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.930\nboth sides of the tracks.\n\n98\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.900\nNot just responsibilities that ensure\nthat the company is protected, but\n\n99\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.570\nalso responsibilities that ensure\nthe employees and customers are protected.\n\n100\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.566\nSo that's just some of the things that\nwe're gonna look at as we dive into this\n\n101\n00:05:23.566 --> 00:05:24.123\nepisode.\n\n102\n00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:27.469\nOne of the first things that we're\ngonna talk about is really related to\n\n103\n00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.367\nthings like your prohibited content and\n\n104\n00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:32.970\nprohibited activity, and that's\nsomething known as incident response.\n\n105\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.040\nIncident response is something that's\nvery, very important to understand\n\n106\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.710\nthe concepts behind something like\nan incident response plan or an IRP.\n\n107\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.570\n&gt;&gt; So an incident response is a policy,\nand it's not a one size fits all.\n\n108\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.630\nIs there one step,\nis there multiple steps?\n\n109\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.010\n&gt;&gt; There usually is more than one step.\n\n110\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.726\nEven just, let's say simply\nyou got identification, and\n\n111\n00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:56.816\nthen we have to respond, right?\n\n112\n00:05:56.816 --> 00:06:01.291\nSo incident response is identifying\nthat something's happened,\n\n113\n00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:06.350\nas well as how do we respond to\nan incident that's occurred, right?\n\n114\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.425\nNow, I want you to understand that\nwe've got different kinds of incident\n\n115\n00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:11.554\nresponse, right?\n\n116\n00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:13.248\nYou can have security incidences, and\n\n117\n00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.080\nkeep in mind that we're not really\nin the security section here.\n\n118\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.354\nAnd as you go on to more advanced\ntraining, you're definitely gonna see that\n\n119\n00:06:20.354 --> 00:06:24.710\nsecurity response, security incident,\nwell what's a security incident?\n\n120\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.395\nTypically that boils down to some\nkind of security breach, right?\n\n121\n00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:32.050\nA security breach is nothing more than\na violation of the security policy.\n\n122\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.567\nBut we're not necessarily saying that it\ncould be something related to information\n\n123\n00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:40.635\nsecurity, as it could be just a violation\nof a policy that leads to maybe some\n\n124\n00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.116\nkind of civil litigation.\n\n125\n00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:46.470\nCould be some kind of, for instance,\njust a termination, right?\n\n126\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.218\nSo it could be some kind of misuse and\nwe have to respond to that, too.\n\n127\n00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:55.864\nSo you can see that there are many, many\ndifferent types of incidences out there.\n\n128\n00:06:55.864 --> 00:06:59.726\nBut what is formally going to be\nsomething that your company or\n\n129\n00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:02.487\nyour employees are gonna\nhave to adhere to.\n\n130\n00:07:02.487 --> 00:07:07.429\nAnd what we really want you to know on\nthe A+ level is that it's really gonna\n\n131\n00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:12.380\nbe dictated by your company and\nthe incident response plan that you have.\n\n132\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.178\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff.\n\n133\n00:07:13.178 --> 00:07:16.343\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right in, and\n\n134\n00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:20.720\nlet's talk about some of the steps\nthat they call out on the exam.\n\n135\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.180\nOne of the first steps that they talk\nabout is, well, first response, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.200\nNow, when we talk about first response,\n\n137\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.580\nwe're talking about what is known\nas really the authority, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.140\nFirst response is,\n\n139\n00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.550\nand it's kinda interesting that they put\nidentify after first response, right?\n\n140\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.563\nWell, what do you mean by that?\n\n141\n00:07:40.563 --> 00:07:43.380\nWell, first response, I want you\nto think about first responders.\n\n142\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.872\nWhen we talk about first responders,\ndepending on the situation\n\n143\n00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:51.265\nthat we talk about first responders, we\ncould be talking about things like what?\n\n144\n00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:56.928\nYour EMTs, or we could talk about\nthings like your law enforcement.\n\n145\n00:07:56.928 --> 00:08:01.770\nWe could take about a security team,\nyour IT staff, right?\n\n146\n00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.840\nSo when we talk about first response,\n\n147\n00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.120\na lot of times what we're talking\nabout is jurisdiction, right?\n\n148\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.710\nWho has the authority?\n\n149\n00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.310\nWho has the authority to respond\nto some kind of incident?\n\n150\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.120\nThen it gets into identification, and\n\n151\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.830\nidentification is going to\nbe a very important step.\n\n152\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.375\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes to identify,\nwho are the players?\n\n153\n00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.825\n[LAUGH] Or could be put into play.\n\n154\n00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:24.338\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, essentially what you have is,\n\n155\n00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.305\nwell, it really could be anybody.\n\n156\n00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:29.763\nAnd again, I know I talk about\nthe jurisdiction and authority, but\n\n157\n00:08:29.763 --> 00:08:34.071\nwhen it comes to identification, literally\nit could be the employee sitting next to\n\n158\n00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:37.771\nyou that says, I think I've seen\nsomebody doing such and such, and\n\n159\n00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:40.163\nwe really shouldn't be having that, right.\n\n160\n00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:45.238\nSo you might call it the whistle blowers,\nbut it could be again, it could\n\n161\n00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:50.830\nbe somebody that's in management, it\ncould be some kind team lead if you will.\n\n162\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.310\nSo identification really is to,\n\n163\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.840\nis really to determine if an incident\nis happening cuz keep in mind that in\n\n164\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.180\nyour first response it doesn't necessarily\nmean that an incident that has happened.\n\n165\n00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.455\nAnd you can take an incident happening,\nit's the identification part that actually\n\n166\n00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:07.604\ndetermines that something\nreally has truly happened.\n\n167\n00:09:07.604 --> 00:09:10.240\nSo, It could be anybody right?\n\n168\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.290\nIt could be, again, somebody that says\nhey, I know we shouldn't be taking\n\n169\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.260\npersonal information down to a wireless\nnetwork, right, because the fact that\n\n170\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.020\nwireless networks have security\nissues that we have to worry about.\n\n171\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.270\nOr maybe they shouldn't be using\na personal device to pull down company\n\n172\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.530\ninformation, because\nthat could be a problem.\n\n173\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.920\nSomebody says hey, I want you to look\nat this Facebook post that I made and\n\n174\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.250\nrealizes in the background some kind\nof a notification header that says hey,\n\n175\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.480\nyou just received an email with whatever.\n\n176\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.690\nAgain, it could be anybody.\n\n177\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.480\nThe next thing is to make sure that it\nis reported to the proper channels.\n\n178\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.690\nAnd again, the proper channels,\nthis has to be thoroughly\n\n179\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.608\nlaid out by the incident response\npolicy or the incident response plan.\n\n180\n00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:55.230\nSo the incident response policy and\nplan can all really work hand in hand.\n\n181\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.440\nAnd really what it's come down to.\n\n182\n00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.240\nI've seen the acronym called both.\n\n183\n00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.120\nBut reporting it through the proper\nchannels is setting up in the plan who\n\n184\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.820\nis it that we contact, right?\n\n185\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.230\nWho is it that we're gonna\ncall when it comes down to\n\n186\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.990\nthe fact that we've identified\nthat an incident has happened.\n\n187\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.600\nIt could be a manager.\n\n188\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.270\nThink of a chain of authority, right?\n\n189\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:22.190\nIf Zach is my direct project lead, right,\nand I'm part of a team or a department,\n\n190\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.800\nright, and he is the department head,\nwell, am I gonna go to the CIO?\n\n191\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.500\nAm I gonna go to the CEO?\n\n192\n00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.700\nWell probably not, right?\n\n193\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.850\nI'm gonna go to Zach first and I'm gonna\nsay, Zach, okay, I was in this cubicle and\n\n194\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.860\nI noticed John Doe doing this,\nright, so I'm gonna go to him, right?\n\n195\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.220\nAnd then who is he gonna go to?\n\n196\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.660\nWell, laid out in the policy of the plans,\nhe's gonna say, well you're gonna go to,\n\n197\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.030\nmaybe he's gonna go to whoever\nhis direct supervisor is.\n\n198\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.040\nMaybe part of the policy says that, you\ndon't go to a supervisor above that but\n\n199\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.350\nyou basically call a meeting right\naway of the department heads.\n\n200\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.850\nAnd then the department heads,\nthey talk about it and\n\n201\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.050\nthen maybe there's an escalation\nprocedure from there.\n\n202\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.280\nSo the improper channels have to be,\n\n203\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.960\nthere's no right or\nwrong person when we say proper channels.\n\n204\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.650\nA lot of times where it does is a follow\nsome kind a chain of authority.\n\n205\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.560\nNow here's the next one and\nhere's where it gets tricky.\n\n206\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.220\nThe next step, what they talk about\nis the data and device preservation.\n\n207\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.340\nAnd there are several,\nseveral steps in this alone.\n\n208\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:28.030\nIn fact, there are entire forensics\ndivisions that specialize in device and\n\n209\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.330\ndata preservation.\n\n210\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.830\nIn fact I've got a couple\nof things we can do here.\n\n211\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.220\nIn fact I've got a diagram here on my\n\n212\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.300\nscreen here that we can talk a little\nbit about data preservation, right?\n\n213\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.610\nWhen we talk any basic forensics, like if\nthere is an incident where you have to\n\n214\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.990\npreserve the data,\nyou have to preserve the dice.\n\n215\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.520\n&gt;&gt; The dice, yeah.\n\n216\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.250\n&gt;&gt; The dice I don't know,\nwe're gambling right.\n\n217\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.230\nNow I got online gambling in mind.\n\n218\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.979\n&gt;&gt; We're throwing the dice.\n\n219\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.840\n&gt;&gt; The device itself, right?\n\n220\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.770\nWe do things like capturing system images,\nright?\n\n221\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.410\nWhen we capture system images, what we do\nis we take a bit by bit copy of whatever\n\n222\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.270\nthe file, the folder, the device,\nthe hard drive that it might be, right?\n\n223\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.270\nYou might go as far as doing\nthings like auditing, right?\n\n224\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.890\nCapturing network traffic.\n\n225\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.790\nLooking at the logs, right?\n\n226\n00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.390\nTypically when we're doing any\nkind of auditing in an incident,\n\n227\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.610\nwe're gonna have some kind of logs that\ncome into play that we can scourer for,\n\n228\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.500\nmaybe some kind of\nidentifying information.\n\n229\n00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.780\nCapturing video.\n\n230\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.950\nWe can do things like that as well.\n\n231\n00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.030\nWhen we talk about capturing\nvideo we can talk about\n\n232\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.740\nlooking at closed circuit TV, right.\n\n233\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.470\nI wanna know, well, was that something\nthat was going on with Zach's computer?\n\n234\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.930\nOkay, well was it actually\nZach that was doing it?\n\n235\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.630\nWe need things like non-repudiation.\n\n236\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.140\nMaybe it wasn't Zach that was doing it,\n\n237\n00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.340\nmaybe his laptop was sitting in\nhis cubicle and it got hacked.\n\n238\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.520\nMight not even be Zach,\nI can look at the video and\n\n239\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.060\nsay, well, Zack wasn't even\nin the office at the time.\n\n240\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.280\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't me.\nIt was Bob.\n\n241\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Bob did it.\n\n242\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.830\n&gt;&gt; You can always say I don't care\nwhat the video says, it lies, right?\n\n243\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.430\nNo, just kidding.\n\n244\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we can scrutinize the video, right?\n\n245\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.790\nAnd we can find out, again, if it has\nto be identification of the person\n\n246\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.520\nthat has caused the incident, right?\n\n247\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.310\nNow the other thing with data preservation\nthat we also have to do is taking hashes.\n\n248\n00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:11.180\nNow, in security we talked about\nhashes as a way to basically\n\n249\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.470\nrun a mathematical operation across\nthe data and it produces a fixed output.\n\n250\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.680\nAnd if the data in any is modified,\n\n251\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.050\neven down at the smallest bit level,\nwhich I'm including adding a comma to it.\n\n252\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.000\nIt changes that fixed linked value.\n\n253\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.320\nIt's called a message digest or\na hash value, right.\n\n254\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.660\nThat's why they say tagging hashes.\n\n255\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.340\nMathematical operation that\nproduces this fixed value so\n\n256\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.370\nthat if the data doesn't maintain its\nintegrity, we're gonna be aware of it.\n\n257\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.790\nWhy is that important?\n\n258\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.410\nWell as you basically document\nyour information, right.\n\n259\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.220\nEspecially documenting\nthings like changes,\n\n260\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.870\nbut let's say you're gonna\npresent it in a court of law.\n\n261\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:54.045\nWell if that data's changed in any way,\nthe defense attorney\n\n262\n00:13:54.045 --> 00:14:00.231\ncan say hey that's not my client's data,\nsomething's been modified.\n\n263\n00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:01.311\nYou put that there.\n\n264\n00:14:01.311 --> 00:14:05.340\nThat person had put it there and\nit's thrown out of a court of law.\n\n265\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.700\nRight, so it's very important.\n\n266\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.770\nScreenshots, now screenshots can actually\nbe covering your own area, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.090\nIf you catch my drift here,\nthat can be your own CYA.\n\n268\n00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.180\nAnd the fact that you're taking\nscreenshots of what you're doing as you\n\n269\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.130\nare observing the data, capturing\nthe data and taking it into custody.\n\n270\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.190\nThe other thing that you can do\nIs interviewing witnesses, right?\n\n271\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:34.760\nA lot of times witnesses can be brought\ninto court and their testimony can be used\n\n272\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.540\nas a way to validate the fact\nthat an incident has happened.\n\n273\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.216\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we can do as well.\n\n274\n00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:42.748\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n275\n00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Now I did mention documentation and\ndocumenting the changes too.\n\n276\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.990\nThis is important.\n\n277\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.410\nThere is something known\nas chain of custody.\n\n278\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.470\nChain of custody is\nsomething that we really,\n\n279\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.170\nreally have to make sure that we adhere to\n\n280\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.500\nbecause it's one of the most crucial\nsteps in the incident response policy.\n\n281\n00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.165\nAgain, making sure that the data maintains\nits integrity as you present it in\n\n282\n00:15:07.165 --> 00:15:08.830\na court of law, all right?\n\n283\n00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.810\nSo let me go ahead and\ntalk a little bit about chain of custody.\n\n284\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.570\nIn fact, with chain of custody,\nyou really have\n\n285\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.750\na whole entire, we could do a whole entire\nepisode in just the chain of custody.\n\n286\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.940\nBut I want you to understand,\nlet's just boil it down to a few things.\n\n287\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.130\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram here\nthat kinda show you what chain of custody\n\n288\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.770\nis, all right?\n\n289\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.387\nWe can simplify the diagram without\nall these individual steps, and\n\n290\n00:15:33.387 --> 00:15:36.814\nI could tell you at looking at\ndifferent chain of custody models,\n\n291\n00:15:36.814 --> 00:15:38.948\nthere are all different kinds, right?\n\n292\n00:15:38.948 --> 00:15:43.285\nChain of custody, what it boils down to\nis the fact that from the moment that you\n\n293\n00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:48.017\nacquiesce the data, that you acquire the\ninformation, first of all you identify and\n\n294\n00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:49.690\nthen you acquire it, right.\n\n295\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.870\nYou assess that something has happened and\nyou acquire it.\n\n296\n00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:59.183\nMaking sure that as it changes hands that\nit maintains the same state it was in\n\n297\n00:15:59.183 --> 00:16:05.670\nfrom the moment you acquired it, from the\nmoment it's presented in a court of law.\n\n298\n00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.050\nAll right, and you can see that the chain\nof custody sometimes can follow\n\n299\n00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.290\nreally the whole entire incident response\nplan or policy or procedures, right.\n\n300\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.360\nSo identifying and\n\n301\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.600\nassessing that something has\nhappened is important, right, and\n\n302\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.790\nagain that boils down to authority,\npreservation of the data, right?\n\n303\n00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.550\nThat's the big thing,\npreservation of the data.\n\n304\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.740\nAll right, well what's\nthe difference between that and\n\n305\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.220\nacquiring the information.\n\n306\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.760\nWell, let me tell you some of the things\nthat you have to worry about, right?\n\n307\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.340\nSo if I walk into an area that I\nhave to preserve the information and\n\n308\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.700\nI grab the monitor and\nI turn it to this way so I can see it.\n\n309\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.710\nI've just ruined the chain of custody\ncuz I touched the monitor, right?\n\n310\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.200\nYou have to preserve, they talk\nabout preserving the crime scene.\n\n311\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.695\nYou notice that in any kind of CSI,\nin your favorite CSI movie or episode,\n\n312\n00:16:53.695 --> 00:16:58.355\nthey don't come in there and start\nmoving stuff and collecting it, right?\n\n313\n00:16:58.355 --> 00:17:00.641\nWhat is the first thing\nthat they start doing?\n\n314\n00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:03.520\nThey break out the camera and\nthey start taking pictures.\n\n315\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.007\nThey take pictures before\nthey put things in the bags.\n\n316\n00:17:06.007 --> 00:17:09.390\nThey take pictures before they\nstart marking chalk lines.\n\n317\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.120\nYou preserve before you acquire.\n\n318\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.750\nWhy?\nBecause I acquire after the fact.\n\n319\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.225\nI put them in bins,\nI put them in boxes, I label right.\n\n320\n00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:21.535\nThat's the acquiesce in your\ncollecting the information right.\n\n321\n00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:24.205\nBut, you're not moving\nanything until you preserve.\n\n322\n00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:25.260\nSo that's important.\n\n323\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.493\nThen, you analyze the information.\n\n324\n00:17:27.493 --> 00:17:30.555\nNow, I want you to notice as we go\nthrough these steps, what are we doing?\n\n325\n00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:33.090\nWe're tracking evidence.\n\n326\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.950\nAnd we're documenting the process, right?\n\n327\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.181\nAnd as it changes hands, cuz you can\nhave multiple departments, right?\n\n328\n00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:43.340\nYeah, either departmental procedures,\nright?\n\n329\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.220\nAnd as I hand maybe I'm preserving\nthe information why document that?\n\n330\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.230\nZack's team comes in acquires and\ncollects the information.\n\n331\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.730\nRight, well he needs to document.\n\n332\n00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.240\nHis team needs to document\neverything that they're doing,\n\n333\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.660\nand as the information changes\nhands to the analysis.\n\n334\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.390\nMaybe the analysis isn't done by Zack's\nteam, it's done by another team.\n\n335\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.670\nWell we need to make sure that we\nhave thorough documentation, right?\n\n336\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:11.303\nWe need to make sure that we're tracking\nthis evidence and as it changes hands\n\n337\n00:18:11.303 --> 00:18:15.953\nwe're thoroughly documenting the process,\nright up until the reporting.\n\n338\n00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:20.820\nAnd the final report, if you will, the\nfinal analysis, well I guess the report\n\n339\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.528\nis the interpretation of\nthe analysis that is documented and\n\n340\n00:18:24.528 --> 00:18:26.800\nthen handed over into a court of law.\n\n341\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.410\nNow, that doesn't necessarily\nmean that it's going to have to\n\n342\n00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.500\nbe a court of law all right.\n\n343\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.570\nAgain, it doesn't mean that there's gonna\nbe some criminal type of litigation,\n\n344\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.840\nit could be a civil litigation,\n\n345\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.130\nit could be internally in your\ncompany where somebody gets fired.\n\n346\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.462\nWell, that firing of that employee\ncould bring you into court and\n\n347\n00:18:41.462 --> 00:18:45.873\nyou need to make sure that this\ninformation has in pristine state,\n\n348\n00:18:45.873 --> 00:18:49.287\nmaking sure that it has\nmaintained its integrity.\n\n349\n00:18:49.287 --> 00:18:50.845\n&gt;&gt; Well the tracking of evidence,\n\n350\n00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:54.730\ndocumenting processes it seems like\nthey go hand in hand, is that true?\n\n351\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.430\n&gt;&gt; They really do.\n\n352\n00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.630\nWhen it comes down to attaining custody,\nit's the tracking of the evidence and\n\n353\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.270\nagain documenting the process\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n354\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.020\nAgain, from the moment that you\nidentified an issue that has happened or\n\n355\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.650\nan incident that has happened, to\nthe moment that you have that final report\n\n356\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.111\nthat is presented in some\ntype of court of law.\n\n357\n00:19:11.842 --> 00:19:15.930\nAll right, now the next thing we\nhave to talk about is licensing.\n\n358\n00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.310\nAnd licensing can be\na little bit confusing.\n\n359\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.240\nLicensing is very important because\nit could cause your company\n\n360\n00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.742\nseveral thousand of dollars and\nyou're not even aware.\n\n361\n00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:28.547\nThat's one of the things that\nwe're gonna dive into next.\n\n362\n00:19:28.547 --> 00:19:30.900\n&gt;&gt; So I see some more acronyms, Wes.\n\n363\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.402\nCan you tell us some more about that?\n\n364\n00:19:32.402 --> 00:19:34.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\na little bit more alphabet soup here.\n\n365\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.080\nWhen we dive in.\n\n366\n00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.169\nAs you ladies and gentleman know that\nhave been following along with us since\n\n367\n00:19:41.169 --> 00:19:46.830\nday one, some of us as far back as the 901\nseries that we've done into the 902.\n\n368\n00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.480\nKnow that A+ is never shy on\nfeeding you alphabet soup.\n\n369\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.160\nAll right, well,\nwe're not stopping anytime soon either.\n\n370\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.706\nSo what Zach's talking about,\nhe can see our list of objectives here.\n\n371\n00:19:56.706 --> 00:20:00.173\nWe've got something known as DRM and\nwe have something known as EULA,\n\n372\n00:20:00.173 --> 00:20:02.310\nsometimes called EULA.\n\n373\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.422\nI never really liked that term.\n\n374\n00:20:03.422 --> 00:20:04.472\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I've always called it\n\n375\n00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:05.340\nthe EULA, all right?\n\n376\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:05.913\nAnd that's not.\n\n377\n00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:08.834\nIt gets even more confusing,\nnot only do we throw an acronym,\n\n378\n00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:11.920\nwe try to put some kind of phonetic\nsound to the acronym, right?\n\n379\n00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.190\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like uvula.\n\n380\n00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nit's a Greek dish, right?\n\n381\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.214\nYou're aware of it?\n\n382\n00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:16.975\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n383\n00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:21.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So DRM,\nDRM is Digital Rights Management.\n\n384\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.822\nDigital Rights Management is basically\na way that companies can protect\n\n385\n00:20:26.822 --> 00:20:29.036\ntheir intellectual property.\n\n386\n00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:33.128\nWhen we're inside of our networks,\nunderstand that it's kinda easy to protect\n\n387\n00:20:33.128 --> 00:20:36.079\nyour intellectual resources or\nintellectual property,\n\n388\n00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:39.763\nthe information within the information\nsystems that you have, right?\n\n389\n00:20:39.763 --> 00:20:41.085\nHow do we do that?\n\n390\n00:20:41.085 --> 00:20:43.900\nWell we've talked about in other episodes,\nwe've mentioned things like for\n\n391\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.090\ninstance permissions that we can\nset with ACLs access control list.\n\n392\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.980\nI could say Zach is the manager, Zach gets\nfull control over the spreadsheet because\n\n393\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.240\nZach is the one that's gonna be\nreporting it to his boss, all right?\n\n394\n00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.442\nHowever, somebody that is maybe just\nadding information to that sale\n\n395\n00:20:59.442 --> 00:21:01.159\nthat spreadsheet, right?\n\n396\n00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.360\nWe wanna give them write permissions,\nright?\n\n397\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.310\nSo that we just allow them to add data.\n\n398\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.440\nBut somebody that isn't supposed to\nhave access to that information at all,\n\n399\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.110\nwe keep them off the list with\nan implicit denial, right?\n\n400\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.410\nWe just keep them off the list you\ndon't have access to that information.\n\n401\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.670\nWell that's great!\n\n402\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.060\nWell than information sitting inside our\nnetworks on our information systems, but\n\n403\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.050\nwhat happens to that information\nonce it leaves our network?\n\n404\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.230\nThat's where a software license comes in,\nright?\n\n405\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.490\nBecause you don't want somebody just to be\nable to reverse engineer your software.\n\n406\n00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.190\nMake modifications to your software.\n\n407\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.430\nSlight little tweak and then resell it.\n\n408\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.000\nAnd then all your hard work is gone for\nnaught because guess what?\n\n409\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.527\nThey're selling your property\nas though it's their own.\n\n410\n00:21:39.527 --> 00:21:43.842\nSo digital rights management is the way to\nensure that your intellectual resources\n\n411\n00:21:43.842 --> 00:21:47.650\nand your information stays protected\nonce it leaves your network.\n\n412\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.835\nBasically, right?\n\n413\n00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:51.170\nThink about software publishers.\n\n414\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.632\nThey wanna make sure that people can't\njust gain access to their software and\n\n415\n00:21:54.632 --> 00:21:55.760\nuse it at their own will.\n\n416\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.445\nAnd if it is proprietary, well,\nI'll come back to that term in a second.\n\n417\n00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.955\nThat they're not gonna just\nbasically have all of their hard\n\n418\n00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:07.345\nwork thrown away because somebody\nmodified it, they resold it as their own.\n\n419\n00:22:07.345 --> 00:22:08.765\nSo digital rights management.\n\n420\n00:22:08.765 --> 00:22:12.947\nAll right now one of the classic examples\nof digital rights management is the movie\n\n421\n00:22:12.947 --> 00:22:13.983\nindustry, right?\n\n422\n00:22:13.983 --> 00:22:19.709\nThere's been a big, big, for a couple\ndecades now, in fact, any time you look\n\n423\n00:22:19.709 --> 00:22:25.460\nat a video and it's got the FBI warning\non it, and say piracy is a crime, right?\n\n424\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.011\nThat's digital rights management.\n\n425\n00:22:28.011 --> 00:22:31.650\nNow, digital rights management and\na warning that says if you copy that and\n\n426\n00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:35.136\nyou sell their intellectual property,\nyou're gonna be fined for it.\n\n427\n00:22:35.136 --> 00:22:39.173\nNow, it goes even further today with\nsoftware as well as videos and stuff\n\n428\n00:22:39.173 --> 00:22:43.930\nis that we can put embedded information\nin there that can be tracked, right?\n\n429\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.080\nWe can use things like encryption,\nencryption technologies and codices if you\n\n430\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.000\nwill, to make sure that that information\nhas some kind of digital stamp on it.\n\n431\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.110\nDigital signatures are an example\nof digital rights management.\n\n432\n00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.467\nNow, I mentioned the term proprietary,\nand I'll come back to ULA?\n\n433\n00:22:59.467 --> 00:23:00.441\nOr ULA here soon.\n\n434\n00:23:00.441 --> 00:23:03.022\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about digital rights\n\n435\n00:23:03.022 --> 00:23:06.203\nmanagement, why would we, actually,\nwe'll go ahead and mention it here.\n\n436\n00:23:06.203 --> 00:23:07.690\nEnd user license agreement.\n\n437\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.730\nAll right, when we talk about\nend user license agreement,\n\n438\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.700\nthis is typically that little check\nmark that you have to put into, with\n\n439\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.910\nyour mouse, you gotta click on, you gotta\nclick next to install a piece of software.\n\n440\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:23.468\nBecause what it is, is a legally binding\ncontract between software publishers and\n\n441\n00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:26.087\nyourself to use their\nintellectual property.\n\n442\n00:23:26.087 --> 00:23:27.470\nNow you might say, well wait a second.\n\n443\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.120\nThat intellectual property is\non my property my computer.\n\n444\n00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.891\nThat's right but\n\n445\n00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:35.133\nthat doesn't give you the right to do\nwhatever you want with our software.\n\n446\n00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:39.407\nAnd that's where the combination of\nthe end user licence agreements and\n\n447\n00:23:39.407 --> 00:23:43.530\nthe rights management kinda\nrun hand in hand all right.\n\n448\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.567\nNow, I mentioned the term\nproprietory all right.\n\n449\n00:23:47.567 --> 00:23:52.305\nThey don't really call out the term\nproprietary versus open source.\n\n450\n00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:54.347\nBut it is something that\nyou should be aware of,\n\n451\n00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:56.962\nwhether it's an operating system or\nany piece of software.\n\n452\n00:23:56.962 --> 00:23:59.320\nOkay, proprietary, what does that mean?\n\n453\n00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:04.157\nProprietary means that it's actually\nthe opposite of open source.\n\n454\n00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:05.602\nThey sometimes call it closed source.\n\n455\n00:24:05.602 --> 00:24:10.733\nBut proprietary means a company is\nmaking money of their software,\n\n456\n00:24:10.733 --> 00:24:13.530\nand you are required to purchase it.\n\n457\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:18.480\nNow, how you purchase it, what portion\nof it you purchase, is up to them,\n\n458\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.242\nbased on the end user license agreement.\n\n459\n00:24:21.242 --> 00:24:23.900\nSo let me give you an example\nof proprietary software.\n\n460\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.230\nThe Windows Operating System\nis proprietary.\n\n461\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:30.150\nSomething that Microsoft for\na very long time now has made and\n\n462\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.390\nthey releases to the end user.\n\n463\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.350\nNow, you might say, well wait a second,\nI bought a computer I didn't pay for\n\n464\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.700\na Windows Operating System.\n\n465\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.580\nDoes that still make it proprietary?\n\n466\n00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.020\nBet it does.\n\n467\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.247\nIt just means that the manufacturer\nof that computer had thousands\n\n468\n00:24:45.247 --> 00:24:50.207\nof licenses that they were\nbasically issued and they paid for.\n\n469\n00:24:50.207 --> 00:24:52.740\nThey're called OEM's,\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers.\n\n470\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.000\nThey put the computers together,\nthey pay Microsoft for\n\n471\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.560\nwhat is known as a volume licensing\ncontract and they pay the big bucks.\n\n472\n00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.200\nAnd they bundle that into whatever\nthe cost of the computer that finally,\n\n473\n00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.580\nyou pay for as an end user.\n\n474\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.260\nBut understand, their software\nis still proprietary, right?\n\n475\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.640\nIt is something that they\nretain all of the rights to and\n\n476\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.170\nthey charge you a fee to pay for.\n\n477\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.040\nUnlike open source software.\n\n478\n00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.450\nOpen source software is the opposite\nside of the tracks, all right?\n\n479\n00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.160\nSometimes called open source software.\n\n480\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.194\nAgain, it's not free.\n\n481\n00:25:26.194 --> 00:25:28.600\nWe have to be very careful about that.\n\n482\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.145\nIt's free use, it's not free.\n\n483\n00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:34.681\nAs in fact the guy who wrote one of the\nlicenses I'll talk about here in a second,\n\n484\n00:25:34.681 --> 00:25:36.238\nthe GPL Richard Stallman,\n\n485\n00:25:36.238 --> 00:25:40.571\nwho was the inventor of something known\nas the GNU public license, the GPL,\n\n486\n00:25:40.571 --> 00:25:44.866\nwhich is essentially, kind of like\nthe father of open-source software.\n\n487\n00:25:44.866 --> 00:25:49.830\nIt is kind of like free to use, but\nnot free as in free beer, all right?\n\n488\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.350\nSo it just basically means\nthat it is royalty free.\n\n489\n00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.955\nEssentially, you don't pay for it.\n\n490\n00:25:55.955 --> 00:25:58.240\nProvided you follow certain types again,\n\n491\n00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.885\nend user license agreement\nyou keep it open\n\n492\n00:26:00.885 --> 00:26:04.565\nother people can view the source code,\nthey can freely make modifications to it.\n\n493\n00:26:04.565 --> 00:26:07.215\nThey can redistribute it to the world.\n\n494\n00:26:08.265 --> 00:26:15.345\nLinux is an example of a open source\nagain non proprietary operating system.\n\n495\n00:26:15.345 --> 00:26:20.075\nI got many different distro base sites\nout there, and I can download Linux, and\n\n496\n00:26:20.075 --> 00:26:22.907\nI can load it up onto a PC and\nnot pay a dime for it.\n\n497\n00:26:22.907 --> 00:26:27.788\nNow, that doesn't mean that there aren't\nportions of open source software that you\n\n498\n00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:29.580\ndo have to pay for.\n\n499\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.970\nUsually it's support, right?\n\n500\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.696\nSo, for instance, I don't have to pay for\nsomething like CentOS, right?\n\n501\n00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:38.910\nThe community enterprise operating system.\n\n502\n00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.083\nIt's essentially the open source\nsoftware or red hat, all right?\n\n503\n00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:46.174\nBut, I don't get support for it,\nI have to pay for support, and\n\n504\n00:26:46.174 --> 00:26:48.590\nthat's where they can\nstart to make their money.\n\n505\n00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.156\nThe software that you download and\n\n506\n00:26:50.156 --> 00:26:53.832\nput on that operating system could be\nproprietary, and you have to pay for that.\n\n507\n00:26:53.832 --> 00:26:55.890\nOr, most probably,\nit could be open source.\n\n508\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.520\nAnd that's why it's important to\nunderstand these concepts because it could\n\n509\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.890\ncost your company thousands of dollars\nif you violate software policy.\n\n510\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.071\nIf you violate piracy laws.\n\n511\n00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:09.970\nIn fact, let me give you an example here.\n\n512\n00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.040\nI've got pulled up on my screen,\nif you guys ever wanna check it out,\n\n513\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.770\ngo to www.gnu.org.\n\n514\n00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.900\nThis is the GNU operating system,\nand more specifically,\n\n515\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.610\nwhat I want is the GNU Public license,\nall right?\n\n516\n00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.808\nGNU is a recursive acronym.\n\n517\n00:27:25.808 --> 00:27:31.772\nIt means GNU is not UNIX,\n[LAUGH] but it's the GPL.\n\n518\n00:27:31.772 --> 00:27:33.180\nYou might hear it, right?\n\n519\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.590\nAnd again,\nnotice that there are still licenses.\n\n520\n00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.680\nYou have to follow it.\n\n521\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.850\nAgain, it is open source,\nand pay attention to it.\n\n522\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.844\nGenerally speaking,\nyou do not have to pay.\n\n523\n00:27:43.844 --> 00:27:46.440\nThey call it copyleft versus copyright.\n\n524\n00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.435\nCopyright means I'm going to pay up\na company to use their property.\n\n525\n00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:52.540\nCopyleft means the opposite,\nit's typically free.\n\n526\n00:27:53.612 --> 00:27:58.200\nAll right, now just because you buy\na single license of a proprietary\n\n527\n00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.540\nsoftware doesn't grant you the right to\nuse it within a corporate environment.\n\n528\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.551\nThe other thing that I want you\nto keep in mind is they also talk\n\n529\n00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:08.875\nabout personal license versus corporate or\nenterprise license.\n\n530\n00:28:08.875 --> 00:28:09.650\nThis is another thing.\n\n531\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:15.520\nA commercial license or a enterprise\nlicense means that you might have to pay\n\n532\n00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.340\nfor multiple copies of the same\npiece of software more than once.\n\n533\n00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.360\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n534\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.880\nMicrosoft, for a long time,\n\n535\n00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.730\nhas had what's known as a volume\nlicensing service center.\n\n536\n00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.810\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nif I buy a personal license of Windows,\n\n537\n00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.540\nthe Windows Operating System,\nI can use that on my computer.\n\n538\n00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.070\nCould be a work computer that’s fine,\ncould be a home computer.\n\n539\n00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.660\nBut what it doesn't give me the ability\nto do is to use that operating system,\n\n540\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.280\nthat installation media, and\n\n541\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.590\ninstall it multiple times across\nmultiple computers within my network.\n\n542\n00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.500\nThat’s where enterprise license comes in,\nvolume licensing more specifically for\n\n543\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.140\ninstance with Microsoft.\n\n544\n00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.213\nBut you also have to understand that\npersonal license, sometimes means you can\n\n545\n00:28:56.213 --> 00:29:00.343\nuse it in your home, but don't take that\nsame piece of software put in a corporate\n\n546\n00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:04.385\nenvironment, and start to make money\noff of whatever the software produces.\n\n547\n00:29:04.385 --> 00:29:05.910\nYou have to pay attention to that too.\n\n548\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.330\nKeep in mind, there's a difference\nbetween personal license and\n\n549\n00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.880\nan enterprise-level license.\n\n550\n00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.660\nA lot of times your\nenterprise-level license allows you\n\n551\n00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.250\nto install on more than one device,\npay attention to the license, but\n\n552\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.560\nit also allows you to use it in\na corporate endeavor as well.\n\n553\n00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.020\nAll right, let's see here,\n\n554\n00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.720\nI know we're running a little bit\nclose to the end of this episode.\n\n555\n00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.390\nOne of the last things\nI want to talk about,\n\n556\n00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.580\nwe haven't really mentioned privacy.\n\n557\n00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.660\nWe've mentioned piracy, but\nwe haven't mentioned privacy.\n\n558\n00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.230\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n559\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.350\nlet's talk a little bit about\nwhat privacy means, all right?\n\n560\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.620\nWell, privacy you have\ntypes of information,\n\n561\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.970\nremember that according the policies,\nwe don't just give out to the public.\n\n562\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.950\nIf we're in corporate environment and\n\n563\n00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.940\nwe are taking things like\npayment card information, right.\n\n564\n00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.120\nCredit card information, right.\n\n565\n00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.250\nThey called PCI.\n\n566\n00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.980\nPayment card that's why\nit comes to mind PCI.\n\n567\n00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.080\nPayment card information, right?\n\n568\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.640\nI don't want as a well I shouldn't and\nI'm required by law in this\n\n569\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.030\ncase if Zach comes to my company,\nbuys a product from me online.\n\n570\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.820\nI have access maybe not directly, but\n\n571\n00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.099\nmy company has access to his\npayment card information.\n\n572\n00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.340\nDoesn't give you the right to sit,\nturn around,\n\n573\n00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.690\nand post it to social media, right?\n\n574\n00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:25.188\nDoesn't give you the right to leave\nthat information on a printer, right?\n\n575\n00:30:25.188 --> 00:30:27.580\nPrint it out, puts it in my office, right?\n\n576\n00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.300\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Wes.\n\n577\n00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.830\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n578\n00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.740\n&gt;&gt; So, we've got to keep in\nmind that we have things like\n\n579\n00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.480\npersonally identifiable information too\nThis doesn't mean just your customers,\n\n580\n00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.770\nit could mean the employees as well,\nright?\n\n581\n00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.490\nHere at ITProTV,\nthey have information about Zach and\n\n582\n00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.060\ninformation about myself where we live,\nour past jobs,\n\n583\n00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.410\nour job experience, what schools did we\nattend, what certifications do we have,\n\n584\n00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.310\nwhat's our social security number.\n\n585\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.710\nThat's called PII.\n\n586\n00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.280\nPersonally identifiable information and\nit has to be protected.\n\n587\n00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.880\nIn fact, remember one of the things I told\nyou when we first started out is that\n\n588\n00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.440\nthere are bodies out there,\nstandards bodies, right?\n\n589\n00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.140\nWe talk about standards all the time here,\nA+, IEEE, we've talked about, what else?\n\n590\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.220\nWe've talked about ANSI,\nthe American National Standards Institute.\n\n591\n00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.930\nWe talk about\nthe International Organization for\n\n592\n00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.450\nStandardization, one of the biggest\nstandards of high bodies there.\n\n593\n00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.342\nBut there's also information\nsecurity bodies, too.\n\n594\n00:31:22.342 --> 00:31:23.520\nOne of them is called NIST.\n\n595\n00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.860\nIf we look here, NIST is what's known as\nthe National Institute of Standards and\n\n596\n00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.119\nTechnology, and you can see that they're\npart of the US Department of Commerce.\n\n597\n00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.210\nWell, they have standards and guides.\n\n598\n00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.380\nThis just happens to be a specification, I\ndon't want you guys and gals out there to\n\n599\n00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.720\nworry about these documentation numbers\nhere, but just to understand that you do\n\n600\n00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:49.370\nhave bodies out there that give you advice\non how to protect confidentiality, right.\n\n601\n00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.680\nKeeping this personally identifiable\ninformation confidential and\n\n602\n00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.500\nwhat you can do to make it confidential.\n\n603\n00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.056\nSo you don't have to make sure that\nyou have things like confidential user\n\n604\n00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:04.299\npolicies and\nthings like security best practices.\n\n605\n00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:08.200\nThis gives you security best practices,\nthey call out on the exam.\n\n606\n00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.589\nLet me go ahead and\njust mention the objective here.\n\n607\n00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:12.264\nApollo Corporate end user policies,\n\n608\n00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:16.085\nthat's pretty much what we've been talking\nabout with end user license agreements,\n\n609\n00:32:16.085 --> 00:32:18.670\nincident response policies,\nacceptable use policies.\n\n610\n00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.050\nBut they also talk about\nsecurity best practices.\n\n611\n00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.740\nThis is where you get the security\nbest practices, right?\n\n612\n00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.000\nA guide to protecting the confidentiality\nof personally identifiable information.\n\n613\n00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.940\nSo keeping that in mind,\nknow that acronym on the exam.\n\n614\n00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.980\nTake heed, right?\n\n615\n00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.760\nTake heed my young Padawans out there.\n\n616\n00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.800\nMake sure that you are aware of this\ninformation, you know some of the terms,\n\n617\n00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.210\nyou're aware of some of the processes\nthat we've talked about and\n\n618\n00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:48.610\nsome of the steps so that when the A+ 902\nexam asks you about these, regardless of\n\n619\n00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:52.430\nwhat the scenario is that they put you in,\nyou'll be able to get those answers right.\n\n620\n00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Privacy, licenses, and policy concepts.\n\n621\n00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:57.470\nWes, wonderful job as usual.\n\n622\n00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.190\nI love Wes.\n\n623\n00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.420\nHe brings so\nmuch history into his teaching.\n\n624\n00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.670\nI just think it's great.\n\n625\n00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:08.612\nAnd by the way, there's a lot\nin the series of CompTIA A+ 902.\n\n626\n00:33:08.612 --> 00:33:10.740\nSo you wanna make sure\nyou watch all the videos.\n\n627\n00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.230\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n628\n00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.590\nAnd thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n629\n00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.850\nRemember, good IT pro is always learning.\n\n630\n00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:17.730\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n631\n00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.471\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n632\n00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:21.389\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n633\n00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:27.284\n[MUSIC]\n\n634\n00:33:27.284 --> 00:33:31.731\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

Coming at you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:12.410\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.645\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.803\nAnd welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:18.427\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:21.642\nAnd in today's episode we are moving\non with more in our A+ series\n\n9\n00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:24.925\nas we have always been because\nthat's what you've signed up for.\n\n10\n00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:25.784\nYou want to look at some A+.\n\n11\n00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:29.395\nYou want to know about A+ so\nyou can pass that exam with confidence.\n\n12\n00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:33.284\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto help us gain such confidence,\n\n13\n00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:35.345\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:37.890\nWes, we're glad to have yet again,\nsir, and how's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.848\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great.\n\n16\n00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:42.247\nAnd this is gonna be an interesting\ntopic when it comes to the objectives.\n\n17\n00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:44.640\nBecause we've been learning\na lot about software.\n\n18\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.675\nAnd guess what,\nthis has nothing to do with software.\n\n19\n00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:49.237\nWe've been learning a lot about hardware.\n\n20\n00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:52.980\nGuess what,\nsecond verse same as the first.\n\n21\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.858\nIt has nothing to do about hardware.\n\n22\n00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:57.020\nThis is gonna be more\nabout communication and\n\n23\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.870\nprofessionalism inside of the workplace.\n\n24\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.980\nAnd you might say,\nwell wait a second Wes, wait, wait, wait.\n\n25\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.330\nThis is a technical exam, right?\n\n26\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.510\nWhat's so technical about that?\n\n27\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.000\nWell, believe it or not, this is something\nthat a lot of the major Fortune 500\n\n28\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.117\ncompanies, a lot of the major companies\nthat actually use CompTIA's A+ as\n\n29\n00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:19.295\nendorsement, asked CompTIA many years\nago to include inside of the training.\n\n30\n00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:21.810\nAnd let me tell you why, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.010\nWhen it comes to communication and\nprofessionalism,\n\n32\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.550\na lot of people out there that are in\nIT are brilliant, very smart people.\n\n33\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.410\nI know you guys and\n\n34\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.920\ngals out there on the other side of\nthe camera are smart people, as well.\n\n35\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.840\nOne of the things that can happen is you\ncan lose your ability to communicate with\n\n36\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.290\nthe people that you're helping.\n\n37\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.850\nSo they wanted to include that.\n\n38\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.280\nThey wanted to include that in\na help desk or an IT situation and\n\n39\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.420\nreally give you, and require, really,\nrequire you to be aware of these things.\n\n40\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.320\nSo that's what we're gonna be\ntalking about in this episode.\n\n41\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.450\nKeep in mind it's gonna be about\ncommunication and professionalism.\n\n42\n00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.511\nAnd this is sometimes more the, you might\nconsider it the bureaucratic stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.750\nMan, I want to learn about hard drives\nfailing and how to repair them.\n\n44\n00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.890\nI want to learn how to do\nthis in the operating system.\n\n45\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.016\nI want to learn about security.\n\n46\n00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:11.550\nI want to learn about that\nwireless access point.\n\n47\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.650\nWell, that's great, please do and\nlearn a lot about it.\n\n48\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.608\nBut also understand that in learning\nthat you also have to understand\n\n49\n00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:23.294\nhow to talk to people when\nit comes to helping them.\n\n50\n00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:25.477\nAnd that's what, again,\nthese objectives or\n\n51\n00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.710\nif you will topics\nare gonna be focused on.\n\n52\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.620\nRight?\n\n53\n00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.647\nSo speaking of objectives,\n\n54\n00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:32.569\nthis says demonstrate proper communication\ntechniques and professionalism.\n\n55\n00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.911\nThat is 5.4 here.\n\n56\n00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:38.289\nAnd one of the first ones they talk\nabout is proper language, all right?\n\n57\n00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.620\nNow we're not gonna put any radio\nedits here in the middle of this one.\n\n58\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.140\nSo when I say proper language, understand\nthere are things that are obvious\n\n59\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.530\nthat just really don't hold\nup in the workplace and\n\n60\n00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.600\nyou shouldn't be using at the workplace.\n\n61\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.929\nProfanity is one of them and I don't know.\n\n62\n00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.200\nThey don't even really\ntalk about profanity.\n\n63\n00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.500\nSo what do we mean with proper language?\n\n64\n00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.884\nWell, if you have never\nbeen in an IT environment,\n\n65\n00:03:00.884 --> 00:03:05.330\nyou learn that one of the things that\nyou will lose the ability to do is\n\n66\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.459\nspeak in comprehensible\ncomplete sentences.\n\n67\n00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.164\nWe always speak in acronyms, in jargon.\n\n68\n00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.120\nDid you check out that SATA drive?\n\n69\n00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.790\nYeah well it's okay, no problem.\n\n70\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.510\nIt might be one of the old ESH boards,\nif you will, ATX board.\n\n71\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.190\nYou gotta worry about the CPU cuz it might\nnot be getting any juice from the PSU.\n\n72\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes,\nI'm not getting an IP address.\n\n73\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.450\nI checked the DHCP server but the door\nprocess doesn't seem to be going through.\n\n74\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.950\nMaybe it's something to do with\nthe IP configuration on the router.\n\n75\n00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.130\nThe switch isn't configured correctly,\nright?\n\n76\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.490\nWe start getting into these types\nof conversations with a customer,\n\n77\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.344\nan end user, and they're like,\nwhoa there, buddy.\n\n78\n00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:46.044\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And while he's saying that,\n\n79\n00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:48.247\nI mean that's actually something you.\n\n80\n00:03:48.247 --> 00:03:51.314\nI think it was yo that was joking around\nabout this a couple of months ago or\n\n81\n00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.580\nsomething, and said I want to see how long\nwe can go with a conversation that we\n\n82\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.110\ndon't say anything but acronyms.\n\n83\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.980\nI think it was you that\nhad mentioned that.\n\n84\n00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.510\nAnd it's surprising, when you record us,\nyou don't have to try.\n\n85\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.890\nThat's usually how we talk anyways, and\nwe just kind of don't realize about it.\n\n86\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.750\nSo, you have to remember that jargon,\njargon doesn't translate to the end user.\n\n87\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.900\nUnderstand that the people that\nare calling you are probably\n\n88\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.650\nalready frustrated.\n\n89\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.080\nIt doesn't seem frustrating to you.\n\n90\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.273\nI know with Dan and I if I've got\nan operating system that's failed,\n\n91\n00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:24.310\nI don't really care, I don't.\n\n92\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.330\nI know that sounds blah, blah,\nblah, blah, I don't care.\n\n93\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.725\n&gt;&gt; I literally had that happen this\nweek and I was like, whatever.\n\n94\n00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:33.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n95\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.802\nwe don't think about it because why?\n\n96\n00:04:34.802 --> 00:04:36.560\nWell, Dan's gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Fix it, yeah.\n\n97\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.240\n&gt;&gt; Download an ISO and\nreload the operating system.\n\n98\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.330\nBut you have to understand that\npeople that are on the other\n\n99\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.238\nside of that conversation,\nwhether physically or on the phone.\n\n100\n00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:49.900\nIt's even worse on the phone because it's\nhard to translate emotion over the phone.\n\n101\n00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.000\nAnd it's even worse if\nyou're using jargon.\n\n102\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.630\nSo understand that people are already\nfrustrated when it's comes to talking to\n\n103\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.188\nyou begin with.\n\n104\n00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:59.016\nAnd then you add things like jargon,\nDHCP, IP addresses, acronyms.\n\n105\n00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:01.670\nAnd they end up feeling stupid.\n\n106\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat is the nail on the head right there,\n\n107\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.380\nis it really makes people feel\nlike you're condescending to them\n\n108\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.220\nif you start throwing out industry terms,\nacronyms.\n\n109\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.610\nYeah, it's our everyday speak and you're\nso used to doing it that it can happen.\n\n110\n00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.571\nBut you have to be very careful because,\nlike Wes said,\n\n111\n00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.047\nthey're probably already frustrated.\n\n112\n00:05:18.047 --> 00:05:21.230\nNow they feel like you're\nbeing condescending to them.\n\n113\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.711\nSo now that anger level\nis starting to rise high.\n\n114\n00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:27.020\nAnd you're just waiting for a problem.\n\n115\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.600\nAnd then they're gonna fire back\nat you and you're gonna feel that.\n\n116\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.080\nAnd what's that gonna do to you?\n\n117\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.900\nThat's gonna get your ire up.\n\n118\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.780\nAnd now you feel like being\nactually condescending, so you do.\n\n119\n00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.450\nAnd what does this do?\n\n120\n00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.770\nIt's just a meat grinder, everything\nstarts getting worse and worse and worse.\n\n121\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.340\nNext thing you know they're wanting\nto speak to your supervisor.\n\n122\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.815\nAnd you're like, yeah,\nI'm printing a resume.\n\n123\n00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:45.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\n\n124\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.760\nand then they talk about\nthins like jargon.\n\n125\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.750\nI'm gonna wipe the hard drive.\n\n126\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.005\nSomebody is saying well, why are you gonna\ngrab a cloth and wipe down the hard drive?\n\n127\n00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:53.280\nWe're talking about formatting it.\n\n128\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.060\nBut again that's jargon\nthat they're not aware of.\n\n129\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.480\nLet me give you an example of where that\nhappens to me, not on a daily basis,\n\n130\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.990\nbut definitely.\n\n131\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.330\nI know Dan loves cars,\nloves engines, talks about engines.\n\n132\n00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.510\nPerson that sits next to me\nis one of our other hosts,\n\n133\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.930\nRonnie Wong, diesel mechanic\nknows engines inside and out.\n\n134\n00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.508\nAnd you know what?\n\n135\n00:06:10.508 --> 00:06:14.360\nWithin one sentence of listening to\nthese guys talk about engines, I'm lost.\n\n136\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.040\nI don't know anything about engines.\n\n137\n00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.830\nI couldn't fix a car to save my life.\n\n138\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.950\nAnd if you've ever had that happen\nto you so don't think just in IT.\n\n139\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.150\nThink about a situation where you're\nlistening to somebody talk and\n\n140\n00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.620\nall of a sudden you're just kind of\nwalked right out of the conversation.\n\n141\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're the odd man out.\n\n142\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.380\nYou take that feeling, and\n\n143\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.590\nplant that into that's how the person that\ncalls your help desk line is feeling.\n\n144\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.010\nBecause they know they have\nno idea why this is broken.\n\n145\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.060\nIf they did they wouldn't call you.\n\n146\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.360\nThey'd fix it themselves.\n\n147\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.980\nThey rely on you,\nthey're looking to you for help.\n\n148\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.440\nSo being a very understanding and\ncalm, and non condescending.\n\n149\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.280\nDon't use jargon-y terms.\n\n150\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.618\nAnd if you do need to, just explain them.\n\n151\n00:06:53.618 --> 00:06:55.620\nJust walk them through that.\n\n152\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.790\nHey, you're not getting to DHCP,\nthat's a fancy way of saying that\n\n153\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.240\nthis computer is not talking\ncorrectly on the network.\n\n154\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.730\nKeep it down simple terms,\nthat's not condescending to them.\n\n155\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.890\nThat's just you being explanatory.\n\n156\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.680\nThey are getting that.\n\n157\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.370\nIt's not talking correctly,\nI understand that.\n\n158\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.570\nAnd do you know how to fix it?\n\n159\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.330\nYeah, it's something we should be able\nto get you through, not a problem.\n\n160\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.570\nAnd always encouraging them that\nyou will solve their issue.\n\n161\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.420\nAnd that actually brings up another\none of the objectives here.\n\n162\n00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.280\nOne of the bullet points is\nproject confidence, right?\n\n163\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.240\nThey talk about maintaining a positive\nattitude, projecting confidence.\n\n164\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.163\nYeah, I do know, all right?\n\n165\n00:07:32.163 --> 00:07:34.710\nBut be honest, that's the big thing.\n\n166\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.590\nBe honest, because maybe you don't.\n\n167\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.680\nMaybe you don't know, right?\n\n168\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.990\nAnd we'll talk about, in another episode,\n\n169\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.140\nwe're gonna talk about\nthe troubleshooting theory, right?\n\n170\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.500\nAnd one of the parts of\nthe troubleshooting theory is escalation.\n\n171\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.210\nThat's why you have multiple\ntiers of help desk.\n\n172\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.950\nIt's why you have different levels.\n\n173\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.580\nYou have junior admin, senior admins,\nexecutive admins, right?\n\n174\n00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.507\nYou have CIOs, chief information officers,\nthat are top of the rung, right?\n\n175\n00:07:55.507 --> 00:08:00.110\nWell, why there are different\nhierarchical levels within your division?\n\n176\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.128\nBecause there are different\nlevels of understanding.\n\n177\n00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:04.125\nThere's different levels of education.\n\n178\n00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:07.754\nWhen it comes to a complex routing\ntopology, I'm not solving it.\n\n179\n00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:10.394\nI'm taking it to Don Pezet,\none of our other hosts that,\n\n180\n00:08:10.394 --> 00:08:13.820\nI'm convinced the man doesn't have DNA,\nhe's got binary in his blood.\n\n181\n00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.680\nBecause that's his wheelhouse.\n\n182\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.290\nSo understand, maintain confidence,\nproject a positive attitude.\n\n183\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.130\nBut be willing to say, I'm not sure,\nbut I can get somebody.\n\n184\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.760\nI can help you find the answer\nyou're looking for.\n\n185\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.810\nAnd if I don't have that answer,\nI'll help you go find somebody that does.\n\n186\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.822\nAll right, so these are good things.\n\n187\n00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:35.591\nAnd, again, I know this kinda seems like\nit steers off the beaten path from IT.\n\n188\n00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:40.457\nBut you'll be surprised how much this\ncan help you accelerate your career if\n\n189\n00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:43.588\nyou can implement this\non a day-to-day basis.\n\n190\n00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:47.476\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I'm not sure if you mentioned,\nthis is what they call soft skills, right?\n\n191\n00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:51.691\nThat's the term, that's the buzzword, soft\nskills, being able to talk with someone,\n\n192\n00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:53.744\nengage with them, have them understand and\n\n193\n00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:56.530\nmake them feel secure in the fact\nthat you are helping them.\n\n194\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.191\nAnd not just being, what's the guy\non the Saturday Night thing?\n\n195\n00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:00.850\n&gt;&gt; Nick Burns.\n\n196\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.105\n&gt;&gt; Nick Burns, you know, kind of a jerk.\n\n197\n00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:07.620\n[LAUGH] Because you have some sort\nof wierd superiority complex.\n\n198\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.780\nNo one, and I'm pretty sure you weren't,\nI know I wasn't, Wes wasn't.\n\n199\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.160\nWe weren't born with this knowledge.\n\n200\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.290\nWe acquired it because we\nfound it interesting and\n\n201\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.600\nnow we use it as a way to\nsupport our lives, right?\n\n202\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.520\nThat's all this is.\n\n203\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.170\nNo one is better or worse.\n\n204\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.050\nThey just don't know about technology,\nyou do.\n\n205\n00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.450\nIf it came to actuarial, guess what?\n\n206\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.310\nCompletely ignorant of that topic.\n\n207\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.360\nNot gonna be able to help\nanybody out with that.\n\n208\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.210\nAnd I have no problems with saying that.\n\n209\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.960\nIf you have a computer problem, come on\nover and I can probably help with that.\n\n210\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you accept your limitations.\n\n211\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.840\nAnd that's what you have to do,\nso definitely keep that in mind.\n\n212\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.170\nNow, it's interesting, the next bullet\npoint's very, very hard for a lot of us,\n\n213\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:43.740\nincluding me.\n\n214\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.750\nDon't ask my wife.\n\n215\n00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.700\nPlease, please don't ask\nher cuz she'll tell you,\n\n216\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.990\nand that's called actively listening.\n\n217\n00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.620\nAll right, now, what do I mean?\n\n218\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.740\nLet's throw the jokes off to the side for\na second, all right?\n\n219\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.630\nI want you to think about how you\ngo through your day-to-day life and\n\n220\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.560\ninteractions, right?\n\n221\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.860\nWe as humans, right,\nour human nature is we wanna be heard.\n\n222\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.710\nWell, what do you wanna be heard,\nwell, what does that mean?\n\n223\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.890\nWell we speak, we talk,\nwe wanna be listened to.\n\n224\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.060\nWe want to be heard.\n\n225\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.768\nWe're taught all of our\nlives how to speak, right?\n\n226\n00:10:11.768 --> 00:10:16.753\nHow to project our voices, how to give\na presentation, how to collaborate, right?\n\n227\n00:10:16.753 --> 00:10:19.041\nVery few people are ever\ntaught how to listen.\n\n228\n00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:22.300\nMilitary aside, and I know you're former\nmilitary, Dan, there's difference.\n\n229\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.860\nThere are situations where you are taught\nto listen because your life depends on it,\n\n230\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.800\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Flip it to receive.\n\n231\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.571\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n232\n00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.635\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there are situations, all right,\n\n233\n00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:37.128\nour first responders out there, our EMTs,\nour fire department, our law enforcement.\n\n234\n00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:40.490\nWe're not talking about any of you guys,\nand gals, out there, right?\n\n235\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.821\nBut a lot of times, if you think about it,\nthat's what we are, as humans, taught, and\n\n236\n00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:44.689\nthat's what we want.\n\n237\n00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:47.292\nWe wanna speak, and we wanna be heard.\n\n238\n00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:51.214\nBut sometimes you have to actively listen,\nright?\n\n239\n00:10:51.214 --> 00:10:55.000\nYou have to step back,\nyou have to do thing like take notes.\n\n240\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.648\nOkay, so Dan you're telling me that you\npushed the power to the front of your\n\n241\n00:10:58.648 --> 00:11:01.526\ncomputer, you didn't see a light or\nyou did see a light.\n\n242\n00:11:01.526 --> 00:11:04.300\nYou did see a light, well,\nlet me write that down.\n\n243\n00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.350\nYou smelled something burning?\n\n244\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.440\nWell, let me go ahead and write that down.\n\n245\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.820\nActively listening, right?\n\n246\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.630\nDoing things like asking the open-ended\nquestions is part of good soft skills,\n\n247\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.280\nlike Dan says.\n\n248\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.367\n&gt;&gt; Play like Colombo, right?\n\n249\n00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:17.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n250\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.569\n&gt;&gt; Help me understand that you had a light\nbut you smelled the burning and then what?\n\n251\n00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:26.630\nRight, you're always asking questions,\nyou're like an investigator, right?\n\n252\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.252\nYou're trying to figure out what\nthe problem might be stemming from.\n\n253\n00:11:30.252 --> 00:11:33.457\nAnd if you don't know the circumstances\nthat are surrounding the problem,\n\n254\n00:11:33.457 --> 00:11:35.620\nyou're not gonna be able to figure it out,\nright?\n\n255\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.270\nIt's just gonna be too difficult.\n\n256\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.180\nYou need that person that deals\nwith that computer on a day-to-day.\n\n257\n00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.420\nIs this normal, is this not normal?\n\n258\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.680\nDoes it typically do this?\n\n259\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.470\nYes or no.\n\n260\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.520\nThey're going to be able to\nanswer those questions, so\n\n261\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.970\nyou have to open the ear\nto hear what they say.\n\n262\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.750\nAnd they might even be\ntelling you information and\n\n263\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.940\nthey don't even realize it, right?\n\n264\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.800\nThey're just telling you stuff about,\nwell, I was going over to Susie's desk and\n\n265\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.200\nSusie didn't have this problem but\nI noticed that me and three others did.\n\n266\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.070\nSo it's not everyone in the office that's\nhaving this issue, but three of you are.\n\n267\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.830\nWhat's unique about those three devices?\n\n268\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.110\nWell, what's unique about the one\nthat's not having the issue?\n\n269\n00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.820\nSee how you can start figuring out where,\nwell,\n\n270\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.440\nlet's look at that one\nthat's not having a problem.\n\n271\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.510\nMaybe I can see that one little\nswitch that's ticked off and\n\n272\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.880\nthat's why you didn't have issue.\n\n273\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.360\nThat's what it's all about.\n\n274\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.130\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and\nit also gives your end user the ability\n\n275\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.540\nto that they think that hey,\nI am gonna help, right?\n\n276\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.410\nThere's a problem here, but\n\n277\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.150\nI can be a part of the solution\nif you give me a chance, right?\n\n278\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.160\nSo actively listening, right, I really\nbad wanted to interrupt Dan there, and\n\n279\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.435\nsay Dan, stop talking.\n\n280\n00:12:41.435 --> 00:12:43.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, just kidding, right?\n\n281\n00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:45.260\n[LAUGH] That's one of the things\nthat they also call out,\n\n282\n00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.890\nthey say don't interrupt your customers,\nright?\n\n283\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.100\nBecause they might be in the middle\nof telling you a point and\n\n284\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.790\nyou think they're going some way and\nthey're actually going a different way.\n\n285\n00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.080\nAnd you just cut them off in\nwhat the solution might be.\n\n286\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.930\nOr if nothing else, you've just\ndelayed in getting to that answer.\n\n287\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.932\n&gt;&gt; But what do they know, Wes?\n\n288\n00:12:59.932 --> 00:13:01.156\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.666\n&gt;&gt; Don't get that attitude,\nthat's the wrong mindset.\n\n290\n00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:06.701\nThey might not know anything, but\nthey do have information that you need.\n\n291\n00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:10.572\nSo just let them and just take it\nlike I said, flip it to receive,\n\n292\n00:13:10.572 --> 00:13:14.910\nand let it come in, and then,\nall right, now let's start to work.\n\n293\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.840\n&gt;&gt; You gotta be a transceiver.\n\n294\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not a transmitter or just a receiver,\n\n295\n00:13:17.825 --> 00:13:19.273\nyou gotta be a bit of both right?\n\n296\n00:13:19.273 --> 00:13:20.098\nSo for sure.\n\n297\n00:13:20.098 --> 00:13:23.338\nThe other thing too is, they talk\nabout being culturally sensitive.\n\n298\n00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:27.409\nAnd now, here in the United States we\ndon't really have to go too far to\n\n299\n00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:32.520\nunderstand that we're really a melting pot\nof a lot of different cultures, all right?\n\n300\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.570\nAnd just because you don't understand\na situation, you don't understand what\n\n301\n00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.840\nsomething looks like, maybe how somebody\nacts, be culturally sensitive, right?\n\n302\n00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.030\nKeep that in mind.\n\n303\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.330\nIf there are professional\ntitles that you have to use,\n\n304\n00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.419\nmaybe you don't use them on a daily basis,\nuse them.\n\n305\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.056\nI know this goes to, and I'm not telling\nyou guys by any means how to raise your\n\n306\n00:13:52.056 --> 00:13:53.870\nkids, but I say yes ma'am and yes sir.\n\n307\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.536\nAnd I say that to a lot of\npeople that are younger to me.\n\n308\n00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:57.610\nWhy?\n\n309\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.030\nBecause I want them to\nknow that I respect you.\n\n310\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:05.250\nI may not know you, and\nI might not like you, but I respect you.\n\n311\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.820\n&gt;&gt; And it's one of those things that I've\nalways thought that if you come with\n\n312\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.170\nrespect, you'll get respect.\n\n313\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.010\nBut be culturally sensitive, right?\n\n314\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.050\nJust because you don't understand\nthe way somebody interacts with you,\n\n315\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.150\ndoesn't he's trying to be mean to you.\n\n316\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:24.601\nI'll give you an example,\nI had a place that I worked with, right?\n\n317\n00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:28.900\nAnd the husband and the wife,\nbeautiful family, absolutely great people.\n\n318\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.880\nI overheard them talking\non the phone to each other.\n\n319\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.562\nI was convinced they were\ngoing to just duke it out.\n\n320\n00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:40.950\nAt the end of that conversation\nsomebody's gonna lose some teeth.\n\n321\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.990\nHad nothing to do with that.\n\n322\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.507\nIt's just,\nthat's the way they spoke to each other.\n\n323\n00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:48.200\nHey, I'm vibrant about what I'm saying.\n\n324\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.432\nBut if you don't understand the culture,\n\n325\n00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:55.397\nyou can mistake that vibrancy for\nbeing offensive.\n\n326\n00:14:55.397 --> 00:14:59.330\nAnd it wasn't even furthest\nfrom the truth, right?\n\n327\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.808\nAnd if I had jumped in there and\nsaid, wow, man,\n\n328\n00:15:01.808 --> 00:15:04.060\nyou're really mad at that person, right?\n\n329\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.470\nHow would they react when they,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n330\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.910\nSo you just understand that, a lot of\ntimes our differences just come down to\n\n331\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.220\ncultural differences,\nwhen you think about it.\n\n332\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.630\nSo definitely check that out.\n\n333\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.710\nI don't want to stress that too much.\n\n334\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.480\nJust understand, use appropriate titles.\n\n335\n00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.174\nSir, Mr., the third, CEO.\n\n336\n00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:21.460\nHowever it works, all right?\n\n337\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.770\nMa'am, if you will.\n\n338\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.420\nBe on time.\n\n339\n00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.687\nIf you are 5 minutes early or 15 minutes\nlate, is what one of my bosses used to\n\n340\n00:15:29.687 --> 00:15:33.610\nsay, if you're 5 minutes early,\nyou're already 15 minutes late.\n\n341\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:38.018\nSo now I'm not saying you have\nto be 15 minutes early to every\n\n342\n00:15:38.018 --> 00:15:42.060\nsingle appointment you have,\nbut be on time, right?\n\n343\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.292\nYour time is money,\nyour customer's time is money.\n\n344\n00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:48.150\nYou don't start off a good\nfoot if you're late.\n\n345\n00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.110\nNow that might be out\nof your control though.\n\n346\n00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.990\nYou have to keep that in mind that your\ncompany might put you behind there but\n\n347\n00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.990\nat least explain that, right?\n\n348\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.919\n&gt;&gt; And my dad use to say,\n\n349\n00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:58.306\nthe most valuable thing that\nI have is my time, right?\n\n350\n00:15:58.306 --> 00:15:59.527\nCuz I can never get it back.\n\n351\n00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:01.097\nOnce it's gone, it's gone.\n\n352\n00:16:01.097 --> 00:16:04.202\nAnd I don't know how much of\nit there is left on the jar.\n\n353\n00:16:04.202 --> 00:16:07.100\nSo if I've given it to you,\nI'm giving you a very valuable thing.\n\n354\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.420\nSo be very sensitive to people's time.\n\n355\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.900\nIf they say hey, let's meet at 8 o'clock.\n\n356\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.580\nBy gum, be there at 8 o'clock and\nbe ready.\n\n357\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.530\nIf they're late, they're late.\n\n358\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:16.328\nThey're just showing.\n\n359\n00:16:16.328 --> 00:16:18.340\nAnd things do happen, right?\n\n360\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.102\nTraffic happens.\n\n361\n00:16:19.102 --> 00:16:23.430\nThere's an accident on the east bound and\nwe were backed up for six hours.\n\n362\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.330\nI couldn't.\n\n363\n00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.620\nBut if you're constantly late,\nthat's really what we're getting at.\n\n364\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.840\nYou're never on time.\n\n365\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.990\nYou're that person that says, well we\nshould tell them that we're going to\n\n366\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.170\nbe there 30 minutes earlier\nthan we actually are,\n\n367\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.560\nthen they'll be there at the right time.\n\n368\n00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.740\nIf you're that person, really think\nabout how you're affecting other people,\n\n369\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:46.390\nbecause it's showing a level of\nI don't wanna say disrespect,\n\n370\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.830\nbut, just you're not taking into\naccount other people, right?\n\n371\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.650\nAnd that they have things to do and\nthat their time is valuable.\n\n372\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.300\nSo treat people's time as\nis valuable as yours is.\n\n373\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.290\nAnd just try to be on time to things.\n\n374\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.470\n&gt;&gt; And when it comes down to\ninformation systems, time is valuable.\n\n375\n00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very valuable.\n\n376\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.410\n&gt;&gt; Very valuable.\n\n377\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.410\nAny time that is lost when people don't\nhave access to their information means\n\n378\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.240\nthat their company is losing productivity,\nwhich means they're losing money.\n\n379\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.071\n&gt;&gt; Your SLA will tell you exactly\nhow much money you're losing.\n\n380\n00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:14.543\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n381\n00:17:14.543 --> 00:17:16.143\nWell, that's a great question.\n\n382\n00:17:16.143 --> 00:17:18.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that's a great response.\n\n383\n00:17:18.063 --> 00:17:20.238\nWhat if your ISP,\nyou lose Internet access?\n\n384\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.312\nLets say your cable.\n\n385\n00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:22.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n386\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.310\n&gt;&gt; Your cable television and\nyou just paid for a prize fight and\n\n387\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.270\nnow your cable is down.\n\n388\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.020\nHow valuable is your time then?\n\n389\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.520\nYou've the entire neighborhood over,\nright?\n\n390\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.300\nAnd again,\nI am trying to put it in to perspective.\n\n391\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.080\nThere are certain companies that\nlose millions of dollars an hour\n\n392\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.020\nthat they don't have\naccess to their money.\n\n393\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.970\nOr I guess money, but their information.\n\n394\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.020\nWell i guess I could be [INAUDIBLE] bank,\nright?\n\n395\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.770\nSo those are some things\nto keep in mind too.\n\n396\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.690\nNow some of the other things too\nis avoiding distractions, right?\n\n397\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.702\nPersonal calls, hold on,\nhold on, hold on on a second.\n\n398\n00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:00.150\nSo what was that?\n\n399\n00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.130\nWait a second hold on.\n\n400\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.410\nWhat did you say?\n\n401\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.060\nThat's very, very annoying.\n\n402\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.467\nI cannot stand that.\n\n403\n00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:07.856\n[LAUGH] And\nagain that's a personal opinion, but\n\n404\n00:18:07.856 --> 00:18:11.305\nI won't even do that to somebody\nthat's a cashier at a grocery store.\n\n405\n00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:12.420\nThat's very rude.\n\n406\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.720\nNow there are times that there\nemergencies, I do understand that.\n\n407\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.415\nBut you make that aware.\n\n408\n00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:21.425\n&gt;&gt; Those are the exceptions to the rule.\n\n409\n00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:22.525\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exceptions.\n\n410\n00:18:22.525 --> 00:18:23.435\n&gt;&gt; Not the rule [LAUGH].\n\n411\n00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:24.995\n&gt;&gt; I'll give you a classic example.\n\n412\n00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:26.185\nI know that you've got kids.\n\n413\n00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:28.205\nThere was a point in\ntime where I had to say,\n\n414\n00:18:28.205 --> 00:18:32.695\nI gotta have my phone on me, my wife is\nabout to give birth at any moment, right?\n\n415\n00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:34.025\nSo there are exceptions to the rules.\n\n416\n00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:37.919\nOr I've got a child that's sick and\nI might have to get to him.\n\n417\n00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:41.862\nBut make them aware and say I am so\nsorry for having to do this, right?\n\n418\n00:18:41.862 --> 00:18:43.670\nAgain you're giving them the chance.\n\n419\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.380\nYou're not just randomly\npicking up a phone.\n\n420\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.070\nLike I said,\n\n421\n00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.170\nI can't even stand doing that to somebody\nthat is a cashier at a supermarket that's\n\n422\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.030\ncourteous enough to be ringing my\nstuff up and I'm like yeah, hold on.\n\n423\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.010\nI just can't do that, but\nthat's the customer service in me.\n\n424\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.065\nTexting, social media sites, right?\n\n425\n00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:01.675\nThe Facebook thing.\n\n426\n00:19:01.675 --> 00:19:03.130\nPut the phone down.\n\n427\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.860\n&gt;&gt; Right,\npaying attention to people if you're\n\n428\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.270\ndividing your attention between\nyour phone and the person.\n\n429\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.328\nI mean we've all probably done it and\nit's horrible, right?\n\n430\n00:19:12.328 --> 00:19:15.252\nOr have had it done to us most likely,\nthat you're talking to someone,\n\n431\n00:19:15.252 --> 00:19:18.060\nyou're engaged in conversation and\nthey're just like, yeah.\n\n432\n00:19:19.178 --> 00:19:21.465\nThat's horrible.\n\n433\n00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:22.038\nYep.\n\n434\n00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:24.350\nIt's very disengaging.\n\n435\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.330\nIt's like,\nwhy are we even having a conversation?\n\n436\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.870\nI'll go talk to the tree stump,\n\n437\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.980\nit'll give me just as much\nfeedback as you are at this point.\n\n438\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.970\nAt least it's not ignoring me\npurposefully, it's an inanimate object.\n\n439\n00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n440\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.851\nAnd here's the one that's actually in\nthe list that annoys me the worst.\n\n441\n00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:43.398\nAgain, you have to understand,\nI come from a restaurant management side,\n\n442\n00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:47.660\nas well as I became a manager because\nI believed I was a decent employee so\n\n443\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.450\nI also had this very early on.\n\n444\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.750\nAnd we still have this today.\n\n445\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.130\nIf you think about it, you guys\nout there are the reason we exist.\n\n446\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.360\nYou are the reason that I\ncan do exactly what I can.\n\n447\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.420\nYou guys are the reason\nthat we can come and\n\n448\n00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.890\nwe can sit in front of big old fake PCBs,\n\n449\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:08.150\nI think I just gave away the secret here\nthat you know, fake circuit boards, right?\n\n450\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.110\n&gt;&gt; You mean that's not real?\n\n451\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.200\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n452\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.270\nSo if you keep that in mind that I cannot,\nand let me get to the point on this one,\n\n453\n00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.810\nis that talking to co-workers\nwhile interacting with customers.\n\n454\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.740\nIn fact that happened to be just\nyesterday and it boils me, right?\n\n455\n00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.330\nSomebody's ringing me up and\nas they're taking in my receipts and\n\n456\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.010\nthey're bagging, they're sitting there\ntalking to one of their other employees.\n\n457\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.800\nYeah, you know?\n\n458\n00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.260\nYeah, yeah, she was talking\nabout not even paying attention.\n\n459\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.660\nI don't consider myself\nbetter than anybody.\n\n460\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.760\nI'm not putting myself on a pedestal.\n\n461\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.180\nBut if I'm paying your salary\nbecause I'm buying your product,\n\n462\n00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.810\nyou should have\nthe courtesy to look at me.\n\n463\n00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.170\nAnd it's the same thing you should treat\nthe customers that you are gonna help fix\n\n464\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.810\ntheir product, whatever it might be.\n\n465\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.888\nAll right.\nSo again,\n\n466\n00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:50.347\nthis is not to beat anybody over\nthe head with a ruler, right?\n\n467\n00:20:50.347 --> 00:20:53.615\nBut it is things that, first of all,\nare gonna be on the exam.\n\n468\n00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:59.070\nAnd second of all,\nthey can make you very, very successful,\n\n469\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.550\njust in your daily interactions and\nyou'd be surprised how quick success comes\n\n470\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:08.260\nwhen you start to use and\nimplement some of these techniques.\n\n471\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.638\nYou know, they talk about dealing\nwith little personal interruptions,\n\n472\n00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:15.190\nI kind of already mentioned that,\nall of that kind of comes into play.\n\n473\n00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.628\nMake somebody aware, right?\n\n474\n00:21:16.628 --> 00:21:20.700\nif there is an exception to the rule, make\nsomebody aware that it's gonna happen.\n\n475\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.480\nYou know, I just have to tell you\nbefore we get started in this,\n\n476\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.660\nI might have to take this call.\n\n477\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.990\nIt might have to happen.\n\n478\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.272\nI might have to rush to the hospital\nbecause my wife is having our child,\n\n479\n00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:30.829\nall right?\n\n480\n00:21:30.829 --> 00:21:33.066\nSo there are exceptions to the rules.\n\n481\n00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:36.307\nDealing with a difficult customer or\nsituation.\n\n482\n00:21:36.307 --> 00:21:39.923\nAll right, I have heard so\nmany people say, fight fire with fire.\n\n483\n00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:42.516\nYou know what real good employees do?\n\n484\n00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:44.189\nThey fight fire with water.\n\n485\n00:21:44.189 --> 00:21:46.260\nYou don't fight fire with fire.\n\n486\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.410\nThat is the stupidest\nthing I have ever heard.\n\n487\n00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.020\n&gt;&gt; Metallica disagrees.\n\n488\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.098\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's okay.\n\n489\n00:21:51.098 --> 00:21:54.213\nMetallica is the one exception,\nalways an exception to rules.\n\n490\n00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:56.419\n[LAUGH] You fight fire with water,\nactually you know who I heard say that,\n\n491\n00:21:56.419 --> 00:21:57.083\nI gotta give credit.\n\n492\n00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:57.755\n&gt;&gt; Who's that?\n\n493\n00:21:57.755 --> 00:21:58.562\n&gt;&gt; LL Cool J.\n\n494\n00:21:58.562 --> 00:21:59.658\n&gt;&gt; Did he really?\n&gt;&gt; He did,\n\n495\n00:21:59.658 --> 00:22:03.012\nLL Cool J says real men\nfight fire with water.\n\n496\n00:22:03.012 --> 00:22:04.456\n&gt;&gt; It just makes sense.\n\n497\n00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:07.099\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basically, try to stop the situation\n\n498\n00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:08.510\nfrom getting any worse\n&gt;&gt; Don't fight back.\n\n499\n00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.870\n&gt;&gt; Don't let it escalate, yeah.\n\n500\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.400\n&gt;&gt; There you go, exactly,\ndon't fight back.\n\n501\n00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.166\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n502\n00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:17.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, if somebody is, again,\nyou're in a help desk situation.\n\n503\n00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.510\nThey're probably not.\n\n504\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.950\nYou are not the person that they\nreally want to be talking to.\n\n505\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.126\nThey don't want to be\ntalking to you at all, right?\n\n506\n00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:26.200\nBaggage claim, All right?\n\n507\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.287\nThat person has a horrible job, right?\n\n508\n00:22:28.287 --> 00:22:30.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because somebody's already\n\n509\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.960\nmad when they get to you.\n\n510\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.340\nSo when you think you have it bad,\ntrust me,\n\n511\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.760\nI'm sure there's jobs out there\nthat have it a lot worse.\n\n512\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.160\nSo again, I can't stress enough,\ndifficult situation or customer,\n\n513\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.470\ntry to diffuse the situation.\n\n514\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.810\nI know this is stressful on you.\n\n515\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.435\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna get you taken care of,\nright?\n\n516\n00:22:46.435 --> 00:22:47.504\nWe're gonna help you out.\n\n517\n00:22:47.504 --> 00:22:50.131\nWe'll help you through this, right?\n\n518\n00:22:50.131 --> 00:22:51.600\nWhat else too?\n\n519\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.820\nAvoid dismissing the customer's problems.\n\n520\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.480\nFailed hard drive, failed piece of\nsoftware, operating system won't boot.\n\n521\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.779\nI told you, if an operating system\ndoesn't boot, I couldn't care less.\n\n522\n00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.110\nBut if you've got a user that's got 15\nyears of digital photos on their computer\n\n523\n00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.730\nand they no longer have access to them,\nthat can be a very big issue.\n\n524\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.700\nIt can be just heartbreaking, all right,\nespecially if it's their kids.\n\n525\n00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.990\nSo understand that everybody's\nsituation is a little bit different.\n\n526\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.096\nAnd do not just dismiss it\nbecause you have seen 100 times.\n\n527\n00:23:27.096 --> 00:23:30.785\nYou might have seen it 100 times, you\nmight know how to fix the situation, but\n\n528\n00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:34.039\nto that person, it might be the very\nfirst time that they've seen it and\n\n529\n00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:37.320\nit might be something that you just\ndon't know what they're gonna do.\n\n530\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.450\nAll right, clarifying statements,\nall right?\n\n531\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.740\nI've already talked about this,\n\n532\n00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.080\nasking open-ended questions to narrow\nthe scope of the problem, right?\n\n533\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.270\nIn fact, you also talked about this in\nthe active listening part where you have\n\n534\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.320\nthree people.\n\n535\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.280\nWell, this has happened to Sally.\n\n536\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.040\nIt's happening to Bob.\n\n537\n00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.786\nIt's happening to,\nI don't know, [CROSSTALK].\n\n538\n00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:53.540\nAll right, there we go.\n\n539\n00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.894\nYes, right?\n\n540\n00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:59.771\n&gt;&gt; Asking open-ended questions means don't\nclose the conversation off by asking yes\n\n541\n00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.326\nand no questions.\n\n542\n00:24:01.326 --> 00:24:03.890\nYou push power on the computer,\ndid it come on?\n\n543\n00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.020\nYes.\n\n544\n00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.810\nAll right,\nthat really didn't help me, right?\n\n545\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.950\nOr no, what happened?\n\n546\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.110\nDid you notice anything\nwhen you pushed the power?\n\n547\n00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.920\nNo, well, you tried.\n\n548\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.710\nBut they could say, yeah, it flickered\non a little bit, and I smelled smoke.\n\n549\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.660\nWell, now I've got a little bit\nmore information, all right?\n\n550\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.900\nWhat has changed since you noticed this?\n\n551\n00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.280\nHas anything changed, might also be\nsomething that is a yes and no question.\n\n552\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.470\nBut what has changed,\nmight come down to nothing, right?\n\n553\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.130\nBut at least you're giving\nyour users a chance,\n\n554\n00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:40.900\nthe people that you're supporting,\na chance to increase the dialogue, right?\n\n555\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.370\nAll right, what else do we got here, Dan?\n\n556\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:47.350\nRestate the issue, all right, or\nthe question to verify the understanding.\n\n557\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.320\nSo, what you're saying is, xyz.\n\n558\n00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.900\nThat also goes back to active listening,\nbecause it gives the customers that you're\n\n559\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.996\nhelping a chance to say, you know what,\nthey really are listening to me.\n\n560\n00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.936\nAnd, at least, for\nthat fraction of a second, I can tell, and\n\n561\n00:24:59.936 --> 00:25:04.080\nyou've gotta maintain your positive\nattitude too, that they care.\n\n562\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.720\nWhether you care or not, all right?\n\n563\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.550\nAnd again, I don't want to come\nacross as just being arrogant.\n\n564\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.600\nI certainly don't mean that,\nbecause I, truthfully,\n\n565\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.900\nI've been in customer service for\na very long time.\n\n566\n00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.650\nIt's one of the hardest jobs you\nwill ever face, because a lot times,\n\n567\n00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.520\nyou do have to be the bomb diffuser.\n\n568\n00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.080\nRight, you are the bomb squad.\n\n569\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.770\nBecause people are already coming in there\nand its already a ticking time bomb.\n\n570\n00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.210\nAgain, don't try to accelerate\nthe clock to the explosion.\n\n571\n00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:28.740\nDon't cut the red wire.\n\n572\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n573\n00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, so do not disclose\nexperiences via social media outlets.\n\n574\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.420\nMan, that person is so stupid,\nyou should have seen it today.\n\n575\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.480\nLet's go post that on Facebook.\n\n576\n00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.199\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that the whole\npurpose of the glass door?\n\n577\n00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:43.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To say my company's horrible, or\n\n578\n00:25:43.246 --> 00:25:44.560\nit's awesome.\n\n579\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n580\n00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.390\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, that's anonymous stuff.\n\n581\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.320\nWhat they mean is like, if you're you and\nyou're logging into Facebook,\n\n582\n00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.210\njust like what Wes was talking about,\ndon't talk about the things in it.\n\n583\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.580\nFirst rule of fight club, right?\n\n584\n00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.960\nDo not talk about fight club.\n\n585\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n586\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.020\nAnd that's just from a personal\nstandpoint, where it is,\n\n587\n00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.700\nagain, you can't teach somebody ethics,\nthey either have it or they don't, right?\n\n588\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.610\nI can't teach you respect,\nyou either have it or you don't.\n\n589\n00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.490\n&gt;&gt; Actually, they do teach ethics.\n\n590\n00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.100\n&gt;&gt; Do they teach ethics?\n\n591\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a class.\n\n592\n00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Ethics 101-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can teach ethics.\n\n593\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.460\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I guess that, okay,\nso don't listen to that right now.\n\n594\n00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.550\nKeep in mind that, again, a lot of\nboils down to, again, just respect.\n\n595\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:28.145\nRespecting the end users and the customers\nthat are coming and using your service.\n\n596\n00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:29.202\nNo, don't use your customers.\n\n597\n00:26:29.202 --> 00:26:32.820\nBut coming in, using your service, because\nthey're the ones that are paying your\n\n598\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.225\nsalary, and\nyou should be thankful for that.\n\n599\n00:26:35.225 --> 00:26:36.535\nAll right, what else do we have here?\n\n600\n00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:41.065\nSet mean expectations, timelines,\ncommunication status with the customer.\n\n601\n00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:42.075\nAll right, so what does that mean?\n\n602\n00:26:42.075 --> 00:26:43.007\n&gt;&gt; What did Charlie Phillips use to say?\n\n603\n00:26:43.007 --> 00:26:46.335\nUnder promise and over deliver, right?\n\n604\n00:26:46.335 --> 00:26:47.275\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n605\n00:26:47.275 --> 00:26:51.895\n&gt;&gt; You think it's gonna take a week to\nfix, tell them it's gonna take two.\n\n606\n00:26:51.895 --> 00:26:54.000\nThen if you meet a week, they're happy,\n\n607\n00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.270\nbecause you fulfilled exactly\nwhat you said you would.\n\n608\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.155\nIf it takes three days,\nthey think you're Superman, right?\n\n609\n00:27:00.155 --> 00:27:02.100\nThey think you're awesome.\n\n610\n00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.310\nAnd even if you thought, well,\nit's gonna take me three days but\n\n611\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.110\nI'm gonna tell them a week.\n\n612\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.465\nSee how it works, is if you come in\nwith the time that you told them or\n\n613\n00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:09.865\nunder, you're great.\n\n614\n00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:13.025\nBut if you take longer than you\nsaid it would, as the expert,\n\n615\n00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:14.515\npeople are gonna get frustrated with you.\n\n616\n00:27:14.515 --> 00:27:16.825\nSo always underpromise and overdeliver.\n\n617\n00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:18.205\n&gt;&gt; You are held responsible, or\n\n618\n00:27:18.205 --> 00:27:21.500\naccountable I should say,\nfor what you say you know.\n\n619\n00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.164\nAll right, and the other thing too is\nyou've got to keep in mind that this is\n\n620\n00:27:24.164 --> 00:27:26.641\nalso protecting you and your company\nin some aspect too, all right?\n\n621\n00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:29.170\nAgain, the timeline is very important.\n\n622\n00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.787\nThe other thing you also have to\nunderstand is that when people see\n\n623\n00:27:31.787 --> 00:27:33.844\nsomebody that has the knowledge\nto fix a computer.\n\n624\n00:27:33.844 --> 00:27:36.406\nYou get there, they might say,\nwell, I've four or\n\n625\n00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:38.710\nfive other issues that I\nalso need you to look at.\n\n626\n00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.354\nWell, that might be something that\nI'm here to solve this issue now.\n\n627\n00:27:42.354 --> 00:27:45.993\nThis is the request that you put in,\nthis is what I'm here to address, right?\n\n628\n00:27:45.993 --> 00:27:49.120\nYou don't call a plumber out for\na leaking faucet and say hey,\n\n629\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.144\nI need you to install this hot\nwater heater at the same time.\n\n630\n00:27:52.144 --> 00:27:54.094\nYou're gonna have to\ncall my company back and\n\n631\n00:27:54.094 --> 00:27:57.239\nyou're gonna have to issue another\nticket or however it works, right?\n\n632\n00:27:57.239 --> 00:27:59.049\nBut again, you set the expectations.\n\n633\n00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:02.910\nThis is what I'm here to fix, and\nhey, hey, we can probably do that.\n\n634\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.040\nI believe it's in one of the services or\nmaybe it's not.\n\n635\n00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.700\nBut call the company up and\n\n636\n00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.319\nhave them address the issue as to\nwhether I should be fixing this as well.\n\n637\n00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:15.100\nAll right, what else do we have too?\n\n638\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.280\nOffer different replacement and\nrepair options.\n\n639\n00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.100\nBe very careful with this one.\n\n640\n00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.160\nBe very careful with this one.\n\n641\n00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.990\nThe reason I say that is because\nif you are helping somebody,\n\n642\n00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.860\nbe careful that you are helping somebody.\n\n643\n00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.368\nI have seen a certain nerdy squad.\n\n644\n00:28:28.368 --> 00:28:30.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I won't mention names.\n\n645\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.660\nThat has crossed the bounds\nin helping people\n\n646\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.050\nto becoming computer salespeople,\nall right?\n\n647\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.047\nIf you don't need a $2,000 computer, don't\nsell a $2,000 computer to somebody because\n\n648\n00:28:42.047 --> 00:28:43.824\nthey need a hard drive replaced,\nall right?\n\n649\n00:28:43.824 --> 00:28:45.770\nDoes that make sense?\n\n650\n00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.361\nAnd to their credit, the one manager that\nwas there, I will always go back to that\n\n651\n00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:53.703\ncertain location regardless of what the\nreputations are for the other stores and\n\n652\n00:28:53.703 --> 00:28:54.260\nlocations.\n\n653\n00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.920\nBecause I needed a new video card,\nmy video card fried.\n\n654\n00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.460\nAnd I went to buy this, and of course,\nI need the latest and greatest.\n\n655\n00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.395\nSo I'm looking at a $250 video card.\n\n656\n00:29:04.395 --> 00:29:08.133\nHe looked at me and said, Wes,\nhe didn't call me by name.\n\n657\n00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:09.648\nBut he said,\nwhat are you gonna do with this card and\n\n658\n00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:10.894\nwhat are you gonna do with your computer?\n\n659\n00:29:10.894 --> 00:29:13.029\n&gt;&gt; Surf the web [LAUGH].\n\n660\n00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:15.049\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthat's almost exactly what my answer was.\n\n661\n00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:17.680\nI'm gonna surf the web and\nsend some emails.\n\n662\n00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.050\nHe goes,\nI would love to sell you this card.\n\n663\n00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.990\nIt's gonna look good at\nthe end of the week for me.\n\n664\n00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:26.330\nBut he said even with some of the best\ngames we have in here right now,\n\n665\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.950\nyou probably aren't even\ngonna use 30% of that card,\n\n666\n00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:31.810\nwhen you could buy this one and\nit's 50 bucks.\n\n667\n00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.910\nSo do you see what I'm saying there?\n\n668\n00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.110\nHe offered a replacement or repair,\nit says if applicable, but he offered one\n\n669\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.460\nthat was what I needed for a better price\nand he didn't try to get one over on me.\n\n670\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.786\nSo I do have to say in the comment that\nI made, there are people out there that,\n\n671\n00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:49.119\nregardless of what their reputation is\nof a certain company, they do excel.\n\n672\n00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:51.990\nAnd he was doing exactly\nwhat this says to do.\n\n673\n00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.550\nAll right, so what else?\n\n674\n00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.928\nProvide proper documentation\nof the services provided, so\n\n675\n00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.894\npeople know exactly what you're doing,\nright?\n\n676\n00:29:58.894 --> 00:30:04.170\nWe're not going into, you hear\nmechanic stories all the time on this.\n\n677\n00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.010\nThat hey, guess what?\n\n678\n00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.800\nYou need your flux capacitor changed.\n\n679\n00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.240\nWhat's that?\n\n680\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.590\nWell, you need a change, right?\n\n681\n00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.964\n&gt;&gt; It's the thing that\nneeds changing [LAUGH].\n\n682\n00:30:12.964 --> 00:30:13.575\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n683\n00:30:13.575 --> 00:30:18.685\nYou need the sky hook\ninstalled on your tow hitch.\n\n684\n00:30:18.685 --> 00:30:22.125\nSo just keep in mind, again,\nI know that we're kinda joking,\n\n685\n00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:24.875\ncuz this can kinda be a dry\nsubject to some people.\n\n686\n00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:26.090\nJust keep in mind that, again,\n\n687\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.805\nproviding the documentations of\nthe services that you have provided.\n\n688\n00:30:28.805 --> 00:30:31.064\nAnd then follow up with the customer,\n\n689\n00:30:31.064 --> 00:30:33.685\nbecause you might notice\nthat you fixed it.\n\n690\n00:30:33.685 --> 00:30:36.586\nYou might know because you\nhave the know-how, right,\n\n691\n00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:38.320\nthat I know I fixed that problem.\n\n692\n00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.745\nBut if you don't verify with the customer\nand follow up with the customer that\n\n693\n00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:45.952\nthe solution is a solution, you might\nnot have done your job completely.\n\n694\n00:30:45.952 --> 00:30:49.552\nAnd here's why I say that,\nlet's say you fixed the hard drive.\n\n695\n00:30:49.552 --> 00:30:52.712\nMachine's performing poorly now,\nit's two weeks later.\n\n696\n00:30:52.712 --> 00:30:56.236\nYou realize the person's got a virus but\nyou didn't follow up with them, so\n\n697\n00:30:56.236 --> 00:30:57.450\nguess what?\n\n698\n00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.293\nYou gave me a horrible hard drive.\n\n699\n00:30:58.293 --> 00:31:01.470\nYou said you're gonna fix the problem,\nthe problem didn't get any better.\n\n700\n00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.254\nNo, the problem is you're downloading\nsoftware that you don't know where it came\n\n701\n00:31:04.254 --> 00:31:04.781\nfrom, right?\n\n702\n00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:06.695\nAgain, not to go Nick Barnes, but\n\n703\n00:31:06.695 --> 00:31:10.061\nyou make sure that you follow up\nwith the end user and say hey,\n\n704\n00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:14.230\nare you happy with what's going on,\nwith the configurations that we had?\n\n705\n00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.430\nDo we need to take a look at anything?\n\n706\n00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.520\nDo you need to bring it back in for\na follow up?\n\n707\n00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.650\nSo that's always a good thing to have too,\nall right.\n\n708\n00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.270\nDealing appropriately with the customer's\nconfidential and private materials.\n\n709\n00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.202\nThis is a clean desk policy.\n\n710\n00:31:28.202 --> 00:31:32.130\nAll right you do not leave\nthis information in the open.\n\n711\n00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.540\nWhen you go to somebody's desk,\nI want you to keep this in mind too.\n\n712\n00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.780\nWhen you go to somebody's desk,\nmaybe your work, maybe you're\n\n713\n00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.570\none of these traveling techs and\nyou go to somebody's desk, what do you do?\n\n714\n00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.540\nDo you turn the papers over that\nhave confidential information it?\n\n715\n00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.900\nDo you ignore them?\n\n716\n00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.420\nYou put them in the drawer, or\ndo you ask the end user to secure them?\n\n717\n00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:57.360\nOn the exam, whatever the most secure and\nconfidential answer is,\n\n718\n00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.880\nI would almost throw money down on it\nthat it would be the right answer.\n\n719\n00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.420\nAsk the end user to secure the documents.\n\n720\n00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.250\nObviously, if it says [LAUGH].\n\n721\n00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.000\nIf any answer makes you laugh,\nchances are it's the wrong answer.\n\n722\n00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Pick the documents up and\n\n723\n00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.290\nread it, right?\n\n724\n00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.798\nWrite down what the social\nsecurity number is.\n\n725\n00:32:14.798 --> 00:32:16.224\n&gt;&gt; Scan it into EC-2 [LAUGH].\n\n726\n00:32:16.224 --> 00:32:20.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if it makes you laugh,\nchances are it's not the right answer.\n\n727\n00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.530\nBut the most secure and\n\n728\n00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:24.400\nconfidential answer is typically\nthe right answer on the exam.\n\n729\n00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.220\nAnd it usually doesn't involve you doing\nanything other than having the customer\n\n730\n00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.260\nsecure those documents.\n\n731\n00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.002\nAll right, last one, I guess that's it.\n\n732\n00:32:34.002 --> 00:32:37.800\nI guess it is cuz they talk about\nthe private information that's located on\n\n733\n00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.480\nthe computer, the desktop, the printer.\n\n734\n00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.520\nI have heard war stories.\n\n735\n00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.050\nActually these are pretty bad stories\nthat people just, they get in there and\n\n736\n00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.960\nthey're fixing a computer and\nall they're doing is a malware diagnostic.\n\n737\n00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.900\nBut now they've looked through\neveryone of the persons photos.\n\n738\n00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.191\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what happens in Vegas stays\nin Vegas kind of thing when it comes to\n\n739\n00:32:54.191 --> 00:32:54.739\nyour computer.\n\n740\n00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:56.618\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n741\n00:32:56.618 --> 00:32:58.120\n&gt;&gt; Same policy applies.\nPeople are people.\n\n742\n00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.780\nThey're allowed to their privacy, they're\nallowed to do whatever they like inside of\n\n743\n00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.600\ntheir own home and inside of their\npersonal computing environment.\n\n744\n00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.020\nSo just respect that for them.\n\n745\n00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.240\nIt's not for us to say yea or nay.\n\n746\n00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.640\nNow if you find something illegal,\nthat's a different story.\n\n747\n00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.490\nObviously we've deemed there are illegal\nthings that you could have on\n\n748\n00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.390\nyour computer.\n\n749\n00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.860\nYou're obligated to report that.\n\n750\n00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.870\nBut other than that, just fix the computer\nand don't worry about the rest of it.\n\n751\n00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, so when it comes\nto the exam, whatever the most secure,\n\n752\n00:33:26.948 --> 00:33:30.048\nconfidential answer is,\nis typically the right answer.\n\n753\n00:33:30.048 --> 00:33:33.070\nDan, like you said, I think we've got it.\n\n754\n00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.430\nKeep in mind communication and\nprofessionalism.\n\n755\n00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.120\nAlways listen to the end user,\ndon't try to rush them into a situation,\n\n756\n00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.260\npay attention to what their needs are,\ndon't downplay it,\n\n757\n00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.640\nand certainly don't talk down to them.\n\n758\n00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.940\nAnd when it comes to any kind of support\nposition that you're gonna be in,\n\n759\n00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.330\nyou're gonna do a great job.\n\n760\n00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.556\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, this is definitely not\nthe most technical episode that we've had\n\n761\n00:33:50.556 --> 00:33:53.198\nto do for the A+ Series but\nit is probably one of the most important.\n\n762\n00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:57.368\nBecause at the end of the day, you're not\njust a person sitting in a cubicle working\n\n763\n00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:00.660\non computers, you're dealing\nwith people who have computers.\n\n764\n00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.900\nAnd that is something you have to take\ninto account, so be very mindful of that.\n\n765\n00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.000\nLook through this list of topics again,\nwatch this episode a few times.\n\n766\n00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.840\nIf you're unsure about anything,\nwe'll try to help you out with that.\n\n767\n00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.360\nAlways ask us questions,\nwe're there for you guys as well.\n\n768\n00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.610\nBut it looks like we're at the end of\nour episode Wes, thanks for joining us.\n\n769\n00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.790\nAnd we do thank our audience out there for\nwatching.\n\n770\n00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.020\nHopefully, you got a lot out of it.\n\n771\n00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.350\nThat's our aim anyway.\n\n772\n00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.082\nBut it's time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n773\n00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:25.390\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n774\n00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:26.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n775\n00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.037\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n776\n00:34:27.037 --> 00:34:34.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n777\n00:34:34.384 --> 00:34:37.184\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia\n\n3\n00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:07.883\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:12.410\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.690\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.980\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.510\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.210\nAs we continue on with CompTIA A+ 902, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.450\nwe're gonna be talking about\ntroubleshooting theories.\n\n10\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.220\nCompTIA's troubleshooting theories.\n\n11\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.380\nThe person bringing us that theory today\nis Wes Bryan, Wes good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, thanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.835\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking all\nat, well, a method to the madness right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.435\nNo, just kidding here, but do keep in\nmind that what we're gonna be looking at,\n\n15\n00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.760\njust like Zach said,\nis CompTIA's troubleshooting theory.\n\n16\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.007\nAnd you probably, if you had to ask\na few of the techs, there at, you know,\n\n17\n00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.593\nthe smart minds at CompiTIA, they would\nsay, hey, you know what, this is a base\n\n18\n00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.910\nline that we've set for the exam, and\nwe definitely want you to know it, but\n\n19\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.894\nimportantly, than just knowing\nour troubleshooting methodology,\n\n20\n00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:02.763\nis that you do have a method\nof tackling problems.\n\n21\n00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:07.004\nAnd that will, hopefully, lead to the\nsolution, and the quickest solution, if\n\n22\n00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:11.368\nyou will, or an expedited solution doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's gonna be a quick\n\n23\n00:01:11.368 --> 00:01:15.547\nsolution, some problems are a little bit\nbigger than others, but the point is is\n\n24\n00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:19.320\nthat you do tackle every problem with\nsome kind of tried and true method.\n\n25\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.340\nWe're going to dive into a six step\nmethod that CompTIA provides, and\n\n26\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.836\nthey do want you to know for the A+ exam.\n\n27\n00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.740\nI'm also going to let you\nin on a little secret, too.\n\n28\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.150\nBecause in Network Plus,\nfor those of you, maybe,\n\n29\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.090\nthat are thinking about maybe going\nfurther in your education here, and\n\n30\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.050\nmaybe you're going to go from\nCompTIA's A+ Plus into Net Plus.\n\n31\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.690\nWell, guess what?\n\n32\n00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:43.870\nYou're gonna see this\ntroubleshooting theory again.\n\n33\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.370\nOne of the things that I\nwant you to think about,\n\n34\n00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.260\nis that you'll learn one\ntroubleshooting theory method.\n\n35\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.305\nAnd it helps you across two\ncertifications, so, again,\n\n36\n00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:57.715\nif you are going through Net Plus as well,\nand\n\n37\n00:01:57.715 --> 00:02:02.415\nyou are sitting any of those exams,\nit will be very beneficial.\n\n38\n00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.345\nNow, what I mean beneficial,\n\n39\n00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:09.325\nby knowing the troubleshooting theory\nis that I really want you to memorize,\n\n40\n00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:13.095\nand yes, I do mean commit to memory,\nthe steps that we're gonna talk about.\n\n41\n00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.680\nAnd I want you to know them forward and\nbackwards.\n\n42\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.060\nNow that is not something that I'm\njust sitting here telling you, just so\n\n43\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.270\nyou can pass a certification,\nor suggesting, I should say,\n\n44\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.570\nI'm definitely telling you here well,\nyou're listening to it.\n\n45\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.780\nBut, it's more of just a suggestion,\nit's something that I actually did when I\n\n46\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.770\nwas studying for A+,\nwhen I was studying for Net Plus.\n\n47\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.160\nAnd why do I say that?\n\n48\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.170\nWell, there's a good possibility,\nand ladies and gentlemen, again,\n\n49\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.700\nI say it time and time again,\nI've seen plenty of the exams, but\n\n50\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.670\nI don't know what's gonna be on your exam.\n\n51\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.246\nThey have such a large bank of questions,\nand these tests have just been, you know,\n\n52\n00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:53.313\nthe integrity of these tests,\nare just really, really well maintained.\n\n53\n00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:56.817\nAnd they do randomize a lot of the\nquestions, and the fact that the questions\n\n54\n00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:59.444\nthat I get aren't going to be\nthe questions that you get,\n\n55\n00:02:59.444 --> 00:03:03.680\nwouldn't be the questions that Zach\nwould get, when you sit the exam booth.\n\n56\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.300\nAnd that's why I say, memorize\nthe adjacencies, the ideas, you know,\n\n57\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.250\nbecause it is about learning the concepts.\n\n58\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.670\nIt's not just about memorizing\nquestions and answers.\n\n59\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.320\nYou have to know the concepts, because\nwhat they might do on the exams is they\n\n60\n00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.410\nmight put you into, I don't know which\nstuff, let's just say theoretically.\n\n61\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.000\nYou're in step three\nthe troubleshooting theory.\n\n62\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.600\nAnd you need to know what is the next\nstep that you apply in the scenario that\n\n63\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.720\nthey're giving you, and you have a series\nof answers to the questions, and\n\n64\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.910\nyou have the know, what is the next step.\n\n65\n00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.410\nThe other thing that they might do too is,\nbecause CompTIA does have multiple choice,\n\n66\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.610\nor not just multiple choice, but\nmultiple right answers to a question.\n\n67\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.700\nRight, we say multiple choice,\n\n68\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.310\nwhich means you got one choice out of\nfour to five possible answers, right?\n\n69\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.870\nYou have things like drag and drops,\n\n70\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.510\nwhere they have a list, and\nthey say pick these out of the list.\n\n71\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.240\nWell, it's not gonna be just one right\nanswer, it's gonna be a multitude of\n\n72\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.660\nanswers that are gonna complete, and\nmake, and represent a complete solution.\n\n73\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.330\nWell, on the exam, when it comes\nto the troubleshooting theory,\n\n74\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.720\nthey might sit you in one portion\nof that troubleshooting theory and\n\n75\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.560\nsay, what is the best next step?\n\n76\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.100\nWhat is the most likely next step?\n\n77\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.820\nWhat is the next couple of steps?\n\n78\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.429\nEach answer represents\na complete solution.\n\n79\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.140\nThere are questions like that, again,\n\n80\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.930\nthey do a really, really good job of\nmaintaining the integrity of these exams,\n\n81\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.400\nand it means that you have to\nmake sure that you are prepared.\n\n82\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.580\nSo that what we're gonna go into the day,\nand\n\n83\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.323\nthat was a little, probably a few minutes\nof a little side road, there, but\n\n84\n00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:48.650\nI really think, Zach, when it comes down\nto it, it'll help them for the exams.\n\n85\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.170\n&gt;&gt; It's important, and there's an order,\nand there's a logical order to everything,\n\n86\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.710\nand that's what we're\ngoing into right now.\n\n87\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.863\n&gt;&gt; They've been, most definitely.\n\n88\n00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:59.028\nSo let's go ahead, and I've got a little\ndiagram here, that we're gonna talk about,\n\n89\n00:04:59.028 --> 00:05:00.560\nand we're gonna go through it.\n\n90\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.270\nI'm just gonna kinda run\nthrough the list rapid fire.\n\n91\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.100\nAnd then what we'll do\nis we'll come back and\n\n92\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.040\nwe'll spend a little time\non each one of these.\n\n93\n00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.580\nSo you can see here are the six steps\nto the CompTIA troubleshooting theory,\n\n94\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.780\nor troubleshooting method.\n\n95\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.900\nAll right,\nvery first one is identify the problem.\n\n96\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.840\nWe have established a theory of\nprobable cause, question the obvious.\n\n97\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.990\nWe're gonna come back, cuz that is a very\nbig parenthesis statement, that not only\n\n98\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.320\ndo you need to apply for the exam, but you\nshould be applying in the real world too.\n\n99\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.750\nAnd I've got a little bit\nmore to expand on that.\n\n100\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.790\nTest the theory to determine the cause.\n\n101\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.440\nEstablish a plan of action to resolve\nthe problem and implement the solution.\n\n102\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.100\nAll right, then the second to last one,\nverify full system functionality, and\n\n103\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.750\nif applicable,\nimplement preventative measures.\n\n104\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.970\nAgain, that's something I'm gonna\ngo in a little bit farther to,\n\n105\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.562\nwhen it comes to\npreventative measures too.\n\n106\n00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:55.890\nAnd then last, but not least,\ndocument findings, actions, and outcomes.\n\n107\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.930\nAnd I can tell you right now that this\nlast step is sometimes overlooked, and\n\n108\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.550\nit is one of the most important steps.\n\n109\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.630\nThey're all important, but this is\ndefinitely one of the most important steps\n\n110\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.910\nto making sure that a problem that you\nhave a solution to does get finalized,\n\n111\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.660\nbecause it isn't finalized if you\nhaven't documented the whole process, or\n\n112\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.330\nat least your findings, I should say.\n\n113\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.600\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive into the first one,\n\n114\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.280\nwe're gonna talk about\nidentifying a problem,.\n\n115\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.800\nWhen we talk about identifying a problem,\n\n116\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.130\nunderstand that it comes down\nto questioning the end user.\n\n117\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.310\nAll right, now,\n\n118\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.060\nin questioning the end user there\nare techniques that you can use, right?\n\n119\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.879\nAnd one of those techniques is gonna\nbe to ask open-ended questions.\n\n120\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.370\nThe reason I say that because close\nended questions don't give you\n\n121\n00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.050\na lot of information that you can gather,\nif you're trying to identify the problem.\n\n122\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.040\nIf you would ask anybody that's\nmaybe an investigative reporter, or\n\n123\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.030\nmaybe an investigator, maybe it's a PI,\nmaybe it's a detective,\n\n124\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.430\nat your local law enforcement agency.\n\n125\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.940\nYou're gonna notice that they probably\ncome with a tactic, a bundle of questions,\n\n126\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.720\nthat lead them, and leapfrog them,\ninto other questions or\n\n127\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.210\npossible solutions, possible theories.\n\n128\n00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.620\nThey give them more information.\n\n129\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.980\nSo Zach, if I say,\nthis morning did you wake up?\n\n130\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.055\n&gt;&gt; Why, yes I did.\n\n131\n00:07:15.055 --> 00:07:18.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that didn't really help me.\n\n132\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.160\nYeah, right.\n\n133\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.620\nThere's my close ended question.\n\n134\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.425\nBut I say, how well did you\nwake up this morning Zach?\n\n135\n00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:28.827\n&gt;&gt; Well actually I woke up,\nwent back to sleep,\n\n136\n00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:31.971\nreset, hit the snooze, it took a while.\n\n137\n00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:36.068\n&gt;&gt; So now we've got a little more\ninformation, that it was a maybe a little\n\n138\n00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:40.047\nbit of a rough morning, or\na little rough start to the morning there.\n\n139\n00:07:40.047 --> 00:07:44.007\nMaybe I'm thinking, in the back of my\nhead, maybe he had a hard time getting to\n\n140\n00:07:44.007 --> 00:07:47.127\nsleep last night,\nmaybe a little caffeine in the afternoon,\n\n141\n00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:50.490\njust to kinda keep him up,\nkinda kept him going towards the night.\n\n142\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.670\nAnd maybe that's a reason.\n\n143\n00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.765\nAnd that's maybe a little reason.\n\n144\n00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:54.804\nMaybe it was that next\ninstallment in the latest series.\n\n145\n00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:57.520\nBut you notice how all these\nthings are kinda coming up?\n\n146\n00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.885\nIn my mind, that I could start to\nbasically expand a little bit more.\n\n147\n00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:04.540\nI got a little bit more information.\n\n148\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.860\nNow, I don't want anymore\ninformation that that, Zach.\n\n149\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.905\nHopefully, you're doing well.\n\n150\n00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:12.200\n[LAUGH] But the point is,\n\n151\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.040\nthe first question didn't really\ntell us much about Zach's morning.\n\n152\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.600\nHe's awake, we could see that.\n\n153\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.570\nI'll be like, my grandpa said.\n\n154\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.410\nI'd say, pop, are you doing okay?\n\n155\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.630\nHe goes, my heart's still beating,\nain't it?\n\n156\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.090\n[LAUGH] All right, well, thanks pop, but\n\n157\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.600\nthat really didn't tell me\nhow you're doing today.\n\n158\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.907\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm vertical.\n\n159\n00:08:29.907 --> 00:08:31.975\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH] so again,\n\n160\n00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:36.686\none of the big things is asking\nthe user questions, right?\n\n161\n00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:40.870\nIdentifying open-ended questions,\nnot just yes and no questions, right?\n\n162\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.840\nAsk questions that also allowed\nthe user to expand a little bit more\n\n163\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.010\non what the problem is, all right.\n\n164\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.000\nRemember we're looking at the problem\n\n165\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.440\nthat doesn't necessary mean that's\nthe cause of the problem right?\n\n166\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.790\nWe also have to identify\nwhat are those symptoms too,\n\n167\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.888\nsymptoms over the underlying cause and\nwe will get to that here in a second.\n\n168\n00:08:59.888 --> 00:09:04.020\nSome of the other things that we need\nto keep in mind is that they say,\n\n169\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.660\nidentify user changes, right,\nuser changes is a computer.\n\n170\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.980\nWell this is pretty important.\n\n171\n00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.230\nI would actually say in the first step,\nthis is on the appropriate part,\n\n172\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.800\nthe latter part of the first step,\n\n173\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.380\ncuz there's some other\nthings you can do as well.\n\n174\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.670\nYou could tell the end user to sit\ndown at whatever the issue is,\n\n175\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.450\ncan you recreate the problem for me?\n\n176\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.890\nCan you show me what the problem is,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.190\nCan you recreate the issue here so\nI can kinda see what's going on, right?\n\n178\n00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.370\nIf it's a hard drive that isn't, maybe\nthe operating system isn't loading up.\n\n179\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.420\nMaybe they're reaching over.\n\n180\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.277\nThey're pressing power on the power button\nright and the computer comes on and\n\n181\n00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:40.857\nit blue screens like we've\nseen in other episodes.\n\n182\n00:09:40.857 --> 00:09:44.432\nWell, if I can kind of see what they\nare seeing, if I can see some of\n\n183\n00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:48.527\nthe frustrations that they are going\nthrough, right, and I can witness it\n\n184\n00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:52.563\nmyself, I can start to formulate maybe\nwhat the probable cause might be.\n\n185\n00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:55.450\nMaybe start writing down so\nadditional information.\n\n186\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.050\nRemember we're going\ndetective here all right.\n\n187\n00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.120\nSome of you are probably too you\nto remember who Columbo is but\n\n188\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.740\nman I tell you right-\n&gt;&gt; I remember Columbo.\n\n189\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Peter Falk, right.\n\n190\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.140\nWhen we talk about Columbo we sit there\nand think, Just one more question, ma'am,\n\n191\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.060\njust one more question.\n\n192\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.490\nHe always had an additional question\nbecause he was trying to formulate and\n\n193\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.100\nsee that bigger picture and\nit is important.\n\n194\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:21.450\nHere's another one of the things\nto keep in mind too, right.\n\n195\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.510\nDetermine if changes have been made.\n\n196\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.520\nHave changes been made to the computer?\n\n197\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.350\nBecause sometimes changes for better or\nworse can cause problems especially if you\n\n198\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.870\nget an end user in there and\nagain we're not going Nick Barnes here,\n\n199\n00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.260\nwe're not being the IT guy that says\njust step back from the computer ma'am.\n\n200\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.700\nOr sir just step back from the computer,\nyou shouldn't be using a computer at all,\n\n201\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.550\nyou don't even have the IQ\npower to turn it on right.\n\n202\n00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.810\nWe don't.\n\n203\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.150\nNow I'm not talking like that\njust make sure are there changes.\n\n204\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.540\nHave changes be made.\n\n205\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.030\nDid somebody reach around\nback to the computer and\n\n206\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.260\nturn the little adjuster switch\non the fixed input power supply.\n\n207\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.890\nRight, from 110 to 220 and now we're\nunder-powering the machine, right?\n\n208\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.450\nMaybe they're doing right.\n\n209\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.120\nMaybe they unplugged the power cord and\nplugged it into\n\n210\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.680\none of the power strips and\nthe power strip's bad.\n\n211\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.580\nFind out is it a software configuration?\n\n212\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.302\nSee that's the other thing too is\nkeep in mind if things have changed,\n\n213\n00:11:20.302 --> 00:11:21.700\nis it a hardware change?\n\n214\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.530\nHas somebody tried to install\na new piece of hardware recently?\n\n215\n00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.870\nHave they uninstalled\na piece of software or\n\n216\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.390\nhardware if you will are there\nconfiguration changes that have been made,\n\n217\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.930\nare there reconfiguration changes\nthat have been made, all right?\n\n218\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.380\nGive you an example, all right?\n\n219\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.210\nYou have an update,\na Windows update comes through.\n\n220\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.130\nA Windows update kinds blurs the line\nbetween software and hardware.\n\n221\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.570\nBecause if I update a driver.\n\n222\n00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.140\nRemember, we've talked about\ndrivers in other episodes.\n\n223\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.540\nYes it is a piece of software.\n\n224\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.000\nBut it is a piece of software that's\nthe translator between my hardware and\n\n225\n00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.950\nmy software.\n\n226\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.570\nAnd if it causes a problem,\n\n227\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.530\nwe have problems on both sides\nof the river, all right.\n\n228\n00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.230\nSo keep in mind that sometimes\nthese blur the line.\n\n229\n00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.600\nAnd if that's a reconfiguration\nof the operating system and\n\n230\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.660\nthe driver has an issue,\nnow we don't talk to the hardware and\n\n231\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.700\nnow gotta figure out which side,\nagain, that's gonna fall on.\n\n232\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.520\nAnd again, is it a software fix,\nor is it a software change?\n\n233\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.280\nAnd again, this could be an install\nof a piece of software that becomes\n\n234\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.940\nproblematic.\n\n235\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.050\nIt could be not an uninstall.\n\n236\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.060\nAnd maybe somebody\nuninstalled an application.\n\n237\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.980\nMaybe they didn't even realize it.\n\n238\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.590\nMaybe they didn't uninstalling\none piece of software and\n\n239\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.220\ntook another piece of software that\nwas actually bundled together.\n\n240\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.950\nFor instance, you uninstalled\nthe Office Suite when the only thing you\n\n241\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.200\nwanted to get rid of, maybe you thought\nwas One Note for whatever reason.\n\n242\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.900\nI'm not picking on Office by any means,\nbut\n\n243\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.520\ninstead of just uninstalling one piece of\nthe software, you uninstalled everything.\n\n244\n00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.540\nIt could be an uninstall.\n\n245\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.410\nIt could be a reconfiguration as well or\na configuration problem.\n\n246\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.190\nThen we get into things like for\ninstance firmware.\n\n247\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.850\nFirmware's another one that like\npatches like Windows Update.\n\n248\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.110\nThe firmware writes, it's not quite\nhardware, it's not quite software,\n\n249\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.540\nthat's why they call it firmware.\n\n250\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.110\nIt sits in between.\n\n251\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.190\nFirmware again is things like your BIOS.\n\n252\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.276\nYour UAFI system.\n\n253\n00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:07.442\nHas that been updated?\n\n254\n00:13:07.442 --> 00:13:08.884\nHas that been reconfigured?\n\n255\n00:13:08.884 --> 00:13:13.390\nDid somebody boot in to the BIOS, manage\nto get in there and disable a device?\n\n256\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.090\nNow we've got firmware that doesn't\nallow you to talk to the hardware,\n\n257\n00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.400\nwhich doesn't allow the operating\nsystem to even know it's there.\n\n258\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.660\nAnd we've got a whole myriad,\na collection if you will, of trouble.\n\n259\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.230\nSo again, keep in mind that\nidentifying the problem is\n\n260\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:34.020\ndefinitely something that you\nhave to take into consideration.\n\n261\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.840\nThe other thing that I would\nsay to take into consideration,\n\n262\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.540\nagain, is end user experience.\n\n263\n00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.910\nBecause depending on their level of\nexperience, you have people that because\n\n264\n00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:50.240\nthey do have a little bit of know how they\nthink they can fix things like can't.\n\n265\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.210\nBut then the on the other hand, you got\npeople that know they can't fix anything,\n\n266\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.880\nso it might not be that big of a deal.\n\n267\n00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.080\nBut again, determine what the user\nexperience level might be.\n\n268\n00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.780\nAll right, the other thing, too, I would\nsay in identifying the problem is identify\n\n269\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.810\nthe symptoms of the problem, because that\ncan help you to formulate solutions.\n\n270\n00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.680\nIs it slow performance, right?\n\n271\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.930\nIs it an Internet connectivity issue?\n\n272\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.080\nIf it is, does it happen to be malware?\n\n273\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.460\nAgain, I don't know what the cause is yet,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.160\nBut is it malware?\n\n275\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.290\nIs it the fact that they\njust didn't pay the bill?\n\n276\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.410\nSo the ISP, the internet service provider,\nand the Internet's been shut off.\n\n277\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.280\nI've had that happen before, where they\ndidn't realize they were set up for\n\n278\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.270\nauto payment.\n\n279\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.640\nIt really wasn't their fault, and\nit wasn't the ISP's fault, either.\n\n280\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.230\nBut they were set up for auto payment,\nand just happened to be the auto payment\n\n281\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.240\nrenewed in a portion where\nthey hadn't been paid yet.\n\n282\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.890\nAnd when it went to renew, well it's\npassed the deadline and the ISP did one of\n\n283\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:50.572\nthose hard kill switches, I mean the soft\nkill switches where they just turn it off.\n\n284\n00:14:50.572 --> 00:14:53.612\nTell them hey, check out your account,\nmake sure your bill's has paid and\n\n285\n00:14:53.612 --> 00:14:55.589\nwe wanna find out cuz it\nlooks like the computer,\n\n286\n00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:57.003\neverything is good here and done.\n\n287\n00:14:57.003 --> 00:15:00.666\nYou don't have any malware,\nyou haven't done anything wrong,\n\n288\n00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:04.340\nthere's no configuration here so\nIt's gotta be on the ISP side.\n\n289\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.610\nAnd you find out, well, I mean, I guess\ntechnically it's on the ISP side, but\n\n290\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.300\nthey just didn't pay the bill.\n\n291\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.800\nSo again, you can always hit reboots,\nis it shutdowns, right?\n\n292\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.540\nCould be overheating,\ncould be a power issue.\n\n293\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.950\nSo again, keep in mind to identify\nthe symptoms of the problem.\n\n294\n00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.010\nThe other thing that I would say too is,\ndetermine the frequency of the problem.\n\n295\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.610\nAnd this is problematic in and\nof itself, and here is why I say it,\n\n296\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.600\nis it an intermittent problem or\nis it a consistent problem?\n\n297\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.350\nRight we talk about memory issues,\nright we talk about trouble shooting\n\n298\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.680\nthe physical memory, and physical memory\nbecause of its random access nature\n\n299\n00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.600\ncertain cells might go\nbad on the memory chip.\n\n300\n00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.880\nBut you only find out that there is\na problem when data is sent to that\n\n301\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.500\nmemory address.\n\n302\n00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.300\nBut when it's not sent\nto that memory address,\n\n303\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.290\nyou don't even know\nthat there's a problem.\n\n304\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.830\nIn fact, it's kind of interesting, Zach.\n\n305\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.810\nI was talking to one of the people here.\n\n306\n00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.139\nWe have a great studio here.\n\n307\n00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:58.286\nA lot of good people in here and one of\nthe things we have is a coffee shop in\n\n308\n00:15:58.286 --> 00:16:01.431\nhere and one of the things I was talking\nto was a lady at the coffee shop and\n\n309\n00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.228\nshe was talking about Her poor car,\nwell, I guess poor her.\n\n310\n00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:07.400\n[LAUGH] Starter issues.\n\n311\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.450\nRight?\nThe starter works, and\n\n312\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.190\nthen it doesn't work.\n\n313\n00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.510\nShe takes it to the mechanic,\nthe mechanic tests it and\n\n314\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.550\nit's working fine at that point.\n\n315\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.330\nMechanic says there's nothing wrong with\nthe starter, we can't find anything.\n\n316\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.540\nTakes it home, won't start.\n\n317\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.462\nTakes it back.\n\n318\n00:16:22.462 --> 00:16:25.400\nFinally, they say, well,\nwe're not exactly sure if it's right or\n\n319\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.010\nnot, but we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna replace it.\n\n320\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.360\nSo she pays for a new starter and\nhasn't had the problem since.\n\n321\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.904\nBut notice that it was\nan intermittent problem, right?\n\n322\n00:16:32.904 --> 00:16:36.024\nYou know the check engine light that\ncomes on only when you're away from\n\n323\n00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:37.070\nthe mechanic's shop.\n\n324\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.970\nBut then you go to the mechanic's shop,\nand they have the diagnostics.\n\n325\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.960\nThey plug it in and\nsay, everything's fine.\n\n326\n00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.100\nAnd the moment you pull out of\nthe parking lot from the mechanic shop,\n\n327\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.846\nthe check engine light comes back on.\n\n328\n00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.790\nKind of like a little gremlin\nin the background taunting you.\n\n329\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.100\nRight, so, find out if it's\nintermittent or it's consistent, right.\n\n330\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.996\nIf I'm pushing the power and\n\n331\n00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:59.180\nit's not until I need a lot of\nprocessing power that it shuts down.\n\n332\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.169\nVersus if it's, if I'm not putting,\nI don't have a lot of applications opened\n\n333\n00:17:03.169 --> 00:17:07.060\nup, I'm not really stressing the system,\nit stays on and running just fine.\n\n334\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.789\nIt could be an overheating issue.\n\n335\n00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:12.083\nCould be the fact that you're\nnot noticing the problem,\n\n336\n00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:16.752\nuntil the heat rises inside of the system\nand the thermal temperature sensors and\n\n337\n00:17:16.752 --> 00:17:20.817\nthe thermal management system,\nshuts everything down, all right?\n\n338\n00:17:20.817 --> 00:17:23.075\nIs it time of day?\nDoes it happen to be an internet\n\n339\n00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:23.900\nconnection?\n\n340\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.212\nCuz it could be, again, time of day.\n\n341\n00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.162\nCould be the fact that,\nhey, I've got very,\n\n342\n00:17:28.162 --> 00:17:30.962\nvery slow performance on my Internet,\nso I gotta have a virus, and\n\n343\n00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:35.230\nyou realize that the person's getting\non the Internet when it's prime time.\n\n344\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.956\nYou're on the East Coast, right?\n\n345\n00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:41.000\nIt could be 5 pm Eastern Standard Time,\neverybody's getting off of work.\n\n346\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.540\nEverybody's accessing the Internet.\n\n347\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.320\nAnd guess what,\nif you're on shared bandwidth and\n\n348\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.670\nyou're sharing your piece of the pie,\nguess where your pie is going.\n\n349\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.073\nProbably to somebody else's table,\nor at least you're sharing with it.\n\n350\n00:17:51.073 --> 00:17:56.570\nSo off hours, peak hours,\nthese things also keep in mind.\n\n351\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.890\nNow, when we talk about\nidentification of the problem too,\n\n352\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.110\nidentify the scope of the problem.\n\n353\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.160\nAnd here's what I say,\nthis is one that gets kind of tricky,\n\n354\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.310\nand I've had to do before,\nespecially in enterprise.\n\n355\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.055\nA lot of times this is more than,\nsay, it's on the home user side, but\n\n356\n00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:14.730\nit's also more sometimes problematic\nwhen it comes to the enterprise side.\n\n357\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:19.470\nIs it a single user or\nis it multiple users, right?\n\n358\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.970\nIf a single user can't print to a printer,\nit could be a permissions issue.\n\n359\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.620\nBut if I have more than one user\nthat can't print to a printer,\n\n360\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.620\nit could be the fact that the printer's\nturned off and it's affecting everybody.\n\n361\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.170\nHere's another one, is it a single\ncomputer that's having the problem?\n\n362\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.650\nCuz as an A+ technician, you might just be\nworking in a tech bench that you just have\n\n363\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.808\nsingle computers come in.\n\n364\n00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:42.060\nBut if you are help desk tier one,\nor tier two, for\n\n365\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.040\nan enterprise level environment,\nhow many end users is it affecting?\n\n366\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.977\nAnd how many PCs?\n\n367\n00:18:47.977 --> 00:18:51.094\nIs it multiple users\nlogging into a single PC?\n\n368\n00:18:51.094 --> 00:18:53.770\nCuz that would isolate that\nthe machine's having a problem.\n\n369\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.440\nOr is it multiple users on multiple PCs?\n\n370\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.930\nBecause that would indicate\na network problem, right?\n\n371\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.430\nNow, here's where it it, and again, that's\nwhere it gets a little tricky, right?\n\n372\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.220\nWhen you have a single machine\nversus multiple machines,\n\n373\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.240\na single user on a single machine, versus\na single user across multiple machines.\n\n374\n00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.470\nAll right, so there is no right answer or\nwrong answer.\n\n375\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.540\nSo you have to again,\nask the open-ended questions,\n\n376\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.280\ngoes right back to the very\nfirst that I stated, right?\n\n377\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.195\nAnd here's where I'd\ntell you the don't do's.\n\n378\n00:19:24.195 --> 00:19:26.580\nWe've talked a lot about the-\n&gt;&gt; The do do's.\n\n379\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.392\n&gt;&gt; The do do's, right?\n\n380\n00:19:27.392 --> 00:19:28.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna let you throw\n\n381\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.110\nthat one in there, Zach, but\nI have to follow along on that one.\n\n382\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.060\n&gt;&gt; I have five kids, the do do's.\n\n383\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.370\n&gt;&gt; I've got a couple myself.\n\n384\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.060\nI was gonna say,\n\n385\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.880\nI can only imagine that that's one\ngonna make it to our blooper reel.\n\n386\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.894\n&gt;&gt; Do what I say, but don't do as I do.\n\n387\n00:19:39.894 --> 00:19:40.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n388\n00:19:40.835 --> 00:19:44.460\nSo here are some things that\nI want you to worry about,\n\n389\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.490\ntry to keep out of your\ntroubleshooting process.\n\n390\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.340\nDon't assume anything, all right?\n\n391\n00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.523\nAssumptions sink ships.\n\n392\n00:19:52.523 --> 00:19:54.514\nDon't assume you know what the problem is.\n\n393\n00:19:54.514 --> 00:19:58.670\nDon't interrupt the end user when they're\ntrying to tell you what the issue is.\n\n394\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.300\nDon't jump to conclusions.\n\n395\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:06.300\nThose three things are something that\nyou have to make sure, all right?\n\n396\n00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.147\nNow, I will tell you that one of\nthe things that they also call out in\n\n397\n00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:10.846\nthis step.\n\n398\n00:20:10.846 --> 00:20:15.319\nI'm gonna tell you what I want you to\nknow for the exam and I'm gonna tell you\n\n399\n00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:19.872\nthe real world, okay, because they\nmight change a little bit, all right?\n\n400\n00:20:19.872 --> 00:20:21.259\nAgain, one's more opinionated, and\n\n401\n00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.620\nI'll tell you where it's opinion\nversus what will be on the exam.\n\n402\n00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.920\nWhat will be on the exam is identifying\nthe problem, they also talk about,\n\n403\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.700\nquestion the end user,\nidentify user changes to the computer and\n\n404\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.830\nperform backups before making changes.\n\n405\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.306\nAnd they put that in identify the problem,\nall right?\n\n406\n00:20:36.306 --> 00:20:38.210\nI want you to notice the verbage on this.\n\n407\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:43.320\nPerform backups before making changes.\n\n408\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.530\nIf you haven't made changes, then you\ndon't need to do this step right now,\n\n409\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.618\ncuz you need to still find out what you\nthink the problem might be, all right?\n\n410\n00:20:51.618 --> 00:20:56.500\nBefore you test anything,\nwhich will be some steps coming up,\n\n411\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.400\nthat's the third step to be more specific.\n\n412\n00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.180\nThat's when you make sure\nthat you have backups, right?\n\n413\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.340\nBecause at this point,\nyou don't even know if you have backups.\n\n414\n00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.610\nYou don't even know if\nyou can perform backups.\n\n415\n00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.750\nIf I have a failed hard drive,\nhow can I perform a backup?\n\n416\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.733\nI haven't even got to that part.\n\n417\n00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:12.778\nI'm trying to identify the problem.\n\n418\n00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:15.600\nI don't even know that the problem's\na failed hard drive at this point.\n\n419\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.840\nI don't even know that the drive is\ncorrupted or if we can obtain and\n\n420\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.170\nrun backups.\n\n421\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.540\nThat's an opinion, all right?\n\n422\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.630\nUnderstand what I just\nsaid there is opinion.\n\n423\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.744\nAll right, so I would say go a little bit\nfurther in finding out the problem to\n\n424\n00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:28.854\ndetermine if you can even run backups,\nall right?\n\n425\n00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:31.768\nNow, if it's time sensitive, and\n\n426\n00:21:31.768 --> 00:21:36.829\nyou know you don't have much time,\nyou run backups, right?\n\n427\n00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.640\nSo just be careful.\n\n428\n00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.590\nBecause even if you have a power issue,\n\n429\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.200\neven in turning on the machine\nto try to run a backup\n\n430\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.180\ncould be detrimental to the system and\nany data that's on that hard drive.\n\n431\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.226\nIf it's time sensitive,\nyou pull the drive out of the machine and\n\n432\n00:21:54.226 --> 00:21:57.945\nyou take it to a company that does data\nrecovery and you recover the information,\n\n433\n00:21:57.945 --> 00:21:59.326\nthen you can run your backup.\n\n434\n00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:02.440\nSo, again,\nI'm differing a little bit from the exam.\n\n435\n00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.785\nI want you to know the exam\nputs in identify the problems,\n\n436\n00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:08.444\nrun backups before you\nperform any changes.\n\n437\n00:22:08.444 --> 00:22:11.344\nBut as you'll see,\nas we go through this list,\n\n438\n00:22:11.344 --> 00:22:14.870\nyou shouldn't be making any changes yet,\nat all.\n\n439\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.252\nSo that should come a little bit later,\nall right?\n\n440\n00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:20.548\nAll right, so that is the very first step.\n\n441\n00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.440\nA lot in that first step, all right?\n\n442\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.715\nI realize that, but it is good to\nhave a nice foundation, all right?\n\n443\n00:22:26.715 --> 00:22:30.294\nNow, the next one that\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n444\n00:22:30.294 --> 00:22:35.200\nis establish a theory of probable\ncause and question the obvious.\n\n445\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.150\nNow, I did say, Zach, on that last one,\n\n446\n00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.723\nwhen we first did the quick run down,\nright, and we said we'd come back and\n\n447\n00:22:40.723 --> 00:22:44.850\nwe'd address each one of these\nindividually, is question the obvious.\n\n448\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:49.270\nAll right, now, that one might not be so\nobvious, what I mean by that, right?\n\n449\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.920\nOr what CompTIA means by that.\n\n450\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.180\nAnd I love the fact that CompTIA puts that\nin there because it is a very overlooked\n\n451\n00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.060\npoint, all right?\n\n452\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:04.750\nSo I go up to an end user's computer and\nthey can't send an email, all right?\n\n453\n00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.000\nFirst thing I should be checking.\n\n454\n00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.220\nDo you have an internet connection?\n\n455\n00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.550\nDo you have a cable\nplugged into your machine?\n\n456\n00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.360\n&gt;&gt; The obvious.\n\n457\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.021\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n458\n00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:15.440\nExactly, yes.\n\n459\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.490\nQuestion the obvious, all right?\n\n460\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.786\nI don't have anything on my monitor.\n\n461\n00:23:18.786 --> 00:23:22.540\nIs the power turned on?\n\n462\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:29.141\nNow, you might sit there and be sitting\nback, going, hm, that's pretty silly, Wes.\n\n463\n00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:33.180\nBut you don't realize how\nmuch that could help.\n\n464\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:33.840\nKeep in mind,\n\n465\n00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.470\nthat you might not be physically\nlooking at the machine at this point.\n\n466\n00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.580\nAnd I've actually had some people tell me,\nactually one of the other hosts.\n\n467\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.890\nOne of the other hosts told me one time\nthat he was helping somebody do some\n\n468\n00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.680\ntroubleshooting on their computer.\n\n469\n00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.652\nAnd so they needed to reboot the machine.\n\n470\n00:23:51.652 --> 00:23:54.413\nHe said, you know what, reboots, gosh,\n\n471\n00:23:54.413 --> 00:23:59.280\nin computing, for whatever reason\nseem to fix a lot of the problems.\n\n472\n00:23:59.280 --> 00:23:59.862\nI'll take a random guess.\n\n473\n00:23:59.862 --> 00:24:03.930\nProbably 80% of your problems can\nbe fixed by itself, by a reboot.\n\n474\n00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.440\nAnd he didn't need\na certification to do it.\n\n475\n00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.160\nHowever, one of the things that he said\nis he would tell the person to reboot.\n\n476\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.110\nNow, understand, mind you, Zach,\nthis was before we had solid state drives.\n\n477\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.321\nI mean, they were out there, but\nyou certainly weren't gonna find them for\n\n478\n00:24:17.321 --> 00:24:20.044\nanything for less than quite a few\nhundred dollars in a machine.\n\n479\n00:24:20.044 --> 00:24:22.924\nSo we're not talking about very,\nvery fast restarts here,\n\n480\n00:24:22.924 --> 00:24:25.243\nwe're still talking\nabout mechanical drives.\n\n481\n00:24:25.243 --> 00:24:28.609\nAnd he would tell the person,\nokay, reboot your machine and\n\n482\n00:24:28.609 --> 00:24:30.940\nthey would do just like this, real time.\n\n483\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.353\nReboot your machine, okay, it's done.\n\n484\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.211\nHe'd say, wow, that fast?\n\n485\n00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:40.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go ahead and\n\n486\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.120\nwe'll reboot the machine again.\n\n487\n00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.542\nGo ahead reboot the machine.\n\n488\n00:24:44.542 --> 00:24:45.370\nAll right, it's done.\n\n489\n00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.070\nSo he was stunned at what\nthe heck was going on, all right.\n\n490\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.190\nTrying to figure out, what,\nis this computer from the future here?\n\n491\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.693\nBecause it is so fast.\n\n492\n00:24:55.693 --> 00:24:57.975\nFound out that the person\nwas just reaching over and\n\n493\n00:24:57.975 --> 00:24:59.417\nturning the monitor on and off.\n\n494\n00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:01.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right?\n\n495\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.550\nSo understand, don't, again,\nthat goes back to the first part.\n\n496\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.760\nDon't assume anything, right.\n\n497\n00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.270\nQuestion the obvious.\n\n498\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.550\nWhen you're identifying the problem,\nfirst and foremost,\n\n499\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.130\ndon't assume anything,\nquestion the obvious.\n\n500\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.600\nI'll tell you what,\nit can save your bread and\n\n501\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.560\nbutter when it comes to troubleshooting,\nright?\n\n502\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.850\nIf I don't have power on the machine,\ndo I have the power cable even connected?\n\n503\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.120\nI've seen that before.\n\n504\n00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.030\nI don't have power.\n\n505\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.610\nOkay.\n\n506\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.530\nSo can you look at the power connector and\ncan you tell me, is it plugged in?\n\n507\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.750\nIs it plugged into a, we call it\na rat's tail, right, the power strip.\n\n508\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.050\nYeah, it's plugged into the power strip.\n\n509\n00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.050\nIs the power strip turned on?\n\n510\n00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:41.770\nLook at it.\n\n511\n00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.250\nPower strip is turned on.\n\n512\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.750\nOkay.\n\n513\n00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.440\nHere's where I messed up.\n\n514\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.650\nI didn't practice what I preach here.\n\n515\n00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:54.326\nPower strip did not, didn't have a lit\nlight or the light itself isn't lit.\n\n516\n00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:55.930\nIt's just a plastic, solid.\n\n517\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.210\nIt's just a plastic button.\n\n518\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.500\nHas no amber light in it,\nlike some of them do, red lights in them.\n\n519\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.230\nRight?\n\n520\n00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.491\nSo, since it wasn't illuminated,\nis the way I should say, the person\n\n521\n00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:10.404\ncouldn't tell, and I didn't think to ask,\nis it even plugged into an AC outlet?\n\n522\n00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:15.396\nSo, the end user did exactly what I\nsaid to do, and it wasn't their fault,\n\n523\n00:26:15.396 --> 00:26:20.570\nbut it was my fault for assuming that\nthe power strip was actually plugged in.\n\n524\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:26.742\nAnd because the light wasn't illuminated,\nI wouldn't have known, all right.\n\n525\n00:26:26.742 --> 00:26:30.904\nThe other thing that I've also seen is the\nfact that a power strip has a fuse breaker\n\n526\n00:26:30.904 --> 00:26:34.180\non it sometimes,\nbecause they're called surge suppressors.\n\n527\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.312\nThey're not, we'll talk about this\ncoming up in another episode,\n\n528\n00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:40.290\nis the fact that it's more\njust like a fuse that breaks.\n\n529\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.617\nAnd you've got to to push in the fuse,\nright.\n\n530\n00:26:42.617 --> 00:26:46.505\nIt keeps an over-voltage from\nhappening within a certain point.\n\n531\n00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:48.080\nLightning strikes, it does what it wants.\n\n532\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.980\nBut, so understand,\nsimple fixes first, right.\n\n533\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.760\nKeep in mind that when you are\nestablishing a theory of probable cause,\n\n534\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.460\none of the things that they do mention and\ncall out, love this one as well,\n\n535\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:08.800\nif necessary, conducting external or\ninternal research based on the symptoms.\n\n536\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.470\nNow, external resources could be\ngoing to the manufacturer's website,\n\n537\n00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.490\ncould be going to forums.\n\n538\n00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.050\nTom's Hardware is one\nthat is absolutely great.\n\n539\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.030\nOverclockers Club.\n\n540\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.990\nYou might be thinking,\nwell, I'm not a gamer.\n\n541\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.180\nI'm not overclocking my computers.\n\n542\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.740\nNo, but\ngamers really know their computers.\n\n543\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.080\nThey've come up with problems.\n\n544\n00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.540\nThey've peeked and tweaked and tried to\nsee everything that they could get out of\n\n545\n00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.150\ntheir computers, so they probably\ncome through a lot of problems.\n\n546\n00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.520\nWhich means they've also come through\na couple of solutions too to keep those\n\n547\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.710\nmachines running.\n\n548\n00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.383\nSo there are forums out there that\nare great, highly recommended.\n\n549\n00:27:41.383 --> 00:27:46.232\nAnd again, we're not making any money by\nsaying something like Tom's Hardware or\n\n550\n00:27:46.232 --> 00:27:50.260\nsomething like Overclockers Club,\nit's just what we use, right?\n\n551\n00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.306\nSo, go to forums, external.\n\n552\n00:27:51.306 --> 00:27:53.900\nOn the internal side, right?\n\n553\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.931\nIf you don't have the training and\ndon't know what the issue is,\n\n554\n00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:00.067\ndon't hesitate to ask somebody.\n\n555\n00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:01.970\nAsk somebody, ask somebody to help.\n\n556\n00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.421\nI'll be the first one to say,\nif my four eyes can't fix it,\n\n557\n00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:06.593\nI'll find somebody else who has four eyes,\nright?\n\n558\n00:28:06.593 --> 00:28:09.337\nZach, well, you only have two eyes,\nso, I don't know if I [CROSSTALK].\n\n559\n00:28:09.337 --> 00:28:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's debatable [LAUGH].\n\n560\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.430\n&gt;&gt; So, but I wouldn't hesitate.\n\n561\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.220\nHey, Zach, I can't figure out\nwhat's going on with this.\n\n562\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.010\nCan you just come over here and\ntake a look?\n\n563\n00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.180\nCuz maybe I didn't question the obvious.\n\n564\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.590\nOr maybe somebody's been\nthrough that same situation and\n\n565\n00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.750\nsays, yeah, I actually went through that\na couple months ago on this other machine.\n\n566\n00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.330\nHere's what I did, all right?\n\n567\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.970\nSo definitely conduct your\nresearch as well, right?\n\n568\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.200\nSo if it's a hardware,\nis it a driver issue?\n\n569\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.830\nDon't overlook the fact that it\ncould be just a driver issue.\n\n570\n00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.600\nDon't overlook that if it's a hardware\nissue, is it a connection issue?\n\n571\n00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.840\nSimple connection, the hard drive,\n\n572\n00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.970\ncomputer isn't booting up,\nwhat did you do recently?\n\n573\n00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.900\nWell, I put in another drive.\n\n574\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.980\nReally?\nDid you hook up the power cable?\n\n575\n00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.150\nDid you hook up the data cable?\n\n576\n00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:58.011\nDid you turn the interface on the\nmotherboard on in the BIOS or the UEFI?\n\n577\n00:28:58.011 --> 00:28:58.929\nI don't know.\n\n578\n00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:01.540\nBut at least we should question it, right?\n\n579\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.550\nSoftware.\n\n580\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.225\nAgain, goes back to\nthe user experience level.\n\n581\n00:29:06.225 --> 00:29:08.290\nAnd again,\nthis is not cutting anybody down.\n\n582\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.250\nIt's just the fact of the matter that\nsomebody might not be able to send\n\n583\n00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.640\nan email cuz they don't know\nto click the Send button.\n\n584\n00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.410\nAnd again, not talking down to anybody.\n\n585\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.500\nYou have to be willing to\nsupport your end users, and\n\n586\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.010\nyou have to meet them at\ntheir experience level.\n\n587\n00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.310\nAnd that doesn't put\nyourself on a pedestal.\n\n588\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.636\nThe moment you put yourself on a pedestal,\ntrust me,\n\n589\n00:29:28.636 --> 00:29:30.994\nyou can be knocked off of\nit really quickly [LAUGH].\n\n590\n00:29:30.994 --> 00:29:31.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n591\n00:29:31.511 --> 00:29:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Just by circumstance alone.\n\n592\n00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.050\nConfiguration, if it's a software issue.\n\n593\n00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.460\nYes, malware, could have been something,\ncould have been an installation, right?\n\n594\n00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.900\nCould be a permissions issue.\n\n595\n00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.214\nBut remember, what we're doing\nis we're looking at the cause.\n\n596\n00:29:46.214 --> 00:29:50.170\nAnd the cause usually has\nsome kind of problem.\n\n597\n00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.610\nWe need to know what\nthe underlying root cause is.\n\n598\n00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.270\nThe symptoms, or\nthe problem is the computer isn't booting.\n\n599\n00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.802\nThat's the problem, that's not the cause.\n\n600\n00:29:59.802 --> 00:30:02.090\nThe cause could be the fact\nthat you don't have power.\n\n601\n00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:06.830\nCould be the fact that you\nhave over-heating, all right?\n\n602\n00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.970\nMalware, malware's a big one.\n\n603\n00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.510\nMalware's the cause, but\nwe also have to determine,\n\n604\n00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.720\nis the end user doing things that they\nshouldn't be doing on their machine\n\n605\n00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.830\nin order to get the malware, right?\n\n606\n00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.070\nSo there are other things that\nwe have to think about as well.\n\n607\n00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.320\nNow, I know, Zach, we only got through\na couple of these bullet points, but\n\n608\n00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.230\nit does look like we are running to\nthe end, cuz, well, I talk a lot.\n\n609\n00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.056\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time, we wanna.\n\n610\n00:30:30.056 --> 00:30:32.746\nWhich hopefully isn't a problem\nin troubleshooting, but\n\n611\n00:30:32.746 --> 00:30:35.772\nit does look like we're gonna have\nto go into a part two on this one.\n\n612\n00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:39.044\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that's okay,\nbecause we are troubleshooting.\n\n613\n00:30:39.044 --> 00:30:42.353\nCompTIA's troubleshooting theory,\nthis will be a part two.\n\n614\n00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:46.402\nThis has been part one as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA A+ 902.\n\n615\n00:30:46.402 --> 00:30:48.490\nLots of great video in this series.\n\n616\n00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.440\nPlease, watch all of them.\n\n617\n00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.020\nYou'll be so glad you did.\n\n618\n00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.302\nExcellent job,

because you'll be glad you did.\n\n11\n00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:33.930\nBringing us all the information we\nneed is Wes Bryan, right over here.\n\n12\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.460\nWes, good to see you again, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.050\n&gt;&gt; Hey, man.\n\n14\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.171\nThanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:37.902\n&gt;&gt; Tell us things, tell us.\n\n16\n00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:38.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n17\n00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:39.929\nYou know what we're gonna talk about?\n\n18\n00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.512\nWe're going to talk about\nthis troubleshooting theory.\n\n19\n00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:44.700\nThat's right, remember,\nwe are putting method to the madness.\n\n20\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.730\nNow speaking of madness,\nin the first part,\n\n21\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.090\nwe had a whole bunch of madness going on.\n\n22\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.590\nJust kidding.\n\n23\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.020\nWe were talking about,\nreally just the first two steps.\n\n24\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.500\nIn fact,\nI wanna take a look at a diagram here,\n\n25\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.170\nbecause these are the steps that we have.\n\n26\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.850\nRemember, we were talking\nabout identifying a problem,\n\n27\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.490\nestablishing a theory of probable cause,\njust a theory to determine the cause,\n\n28\n00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.220\nestablish a plan, if I could say that,\n\n29\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.540\nestablish a plan of action to resolve\nthe problem and implement a solution.\n\n30\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.840\nVerify full system functionality,\nand if applicable,\n\n31\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820\nimplement preventive measures and document\nyour findings, actions and outcomes.\n\n32\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.410\nWell, in the first part,\nwe really only got to the first two steps.\n\n33\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.350\nWe got through identifying the problem and\nestablishing the theory of probable cause.\n\n34\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.530\nAs just a really quick recap,\nif you're not aware, go back and\n\n35\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.870\nwatch that first one.\n\n36\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.520\nCome back here and\nwe'll see in the second one.\n\n37\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.230\nKeep in mind, don't assume anything, and\nalways question the obvious, right, when\n\n38\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.530\nit comes to identifying the problem and\nestablishing a theory of probable cause.\n\n39\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.890\nNow let's go ahead and one more time let's\ntake a look at the next one here, right?\n\n40\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.655\nWe got test the theory\nto determine the cause.\n\n41\n00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:52.160\nAll right, now there are a couple of\nthings that we need to think about\n\n42\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.770\nwhen it comes to testing the theory\nto determine the cause, all right?\n\n43\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.410\nHere's where you might\nstart making changes.\n\n44\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.450\nYou could potentially make changes to\na system that could cause a problem.\n\n45\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.390\nSo if you haven't done it up until this\npoint, I mentioned it in the first step,\n\n46\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.310\nbut if you haven't done\nit up until this point,\n\n47\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.330\nyou need to take your backups, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.297\nNow one of the things you have\nto keep in mind is that if you\n\n49\n00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:21.376\nare going to take backups, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.920\nI've kinda put these in a couple\ndifferent locations, right?\n\n51\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.737\nIf we're gonna implement a plan of action,\nright,\n\n52\n00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:29.490\nimplement a plan of action\nto resolve the problem,\n\n53\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.320\nwhich is the next step after that, you\ncould put those there as well, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.006\nIf you're gonna start testing theories\nto determine your causes, right,\n\n55\n00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.760\nif you believe that it's\nan overheating issue, right?\n\n56\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.670\nAgain, you could cause damage to\nthe system and that could corrupt data.\n\n57\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.140\nSo at this point, I'll say that\nI'm probably going to say that\n\n58\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.620\nyou should determine about\nyour backups here, right,\n\n59\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.130\nrather than putting them in step four,\nlike I said.\n\n60\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.330\nIf you check the notes out\nthat we put up on the website,\n\n61\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.620\nyou might see it in step four.\n\n62\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.330\nAgain, because of the fact that it's\nnot until you start making changes, if\n\n63\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.950\nyou're testing a theory to determine the\ncause and that implies that you're gonna\n\n64\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.390\nstart making some changes, you definitely\nhave to start your backup process now.\n\n65\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.740\nYou need to determine,\nfirst of all, are backups present?\n\n66\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.150\nAll right, maybe I already have backups.\n\n67\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.760\nIf you already have backups and you have\na backup system running, then you're good.\n\n68\n00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.390\nYou can start testing theories.\n\n69\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.694\nYou also have to understand,\ncan the backups even be taken, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:26.694 --> 00:03:27.960\nAnd here's what I mean by that.\n\n71\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.132\nIf you have a hard drive that's failing,\nall right,\n\n72\n00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:32.550\nyou might not wanna reboot your system.\n\n73\n00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.407\nRight, there are times where I've seen\nhard drives that while the system was\n\n74\n00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:38.440\nstill powered on would function.\n\n75\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.570\nThe moment you restarted\nthe machine to try to test things,\n\n76\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.866\nthe hard drive never initiated again.\n\n77\n00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:47.230\nAnd now it's to the point where you\nhave to take it out of the machine,\n\n78\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.400\nyou have to, if it's important enough, you\nhave to take it to some kind of company\n\n79\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.040\nand they have to perform data recovery.\n\n80\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.165\nUnderstand that data recovery\nsolutions can be very expensive, and\n\n81\n00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:02.100\nwhen we have hard drives today\nthat are terabytes, all right,\n\n82\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.938\nyou can get into several hundreds of\ndollars very, very quickly, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:10.528\nSo all right, that's why I say if you're\ntesting a theory to determine the cause\n\n84\n00:04:10.528 --> 00:04:14.915\nhere in the third step and that implies\nmaking some kind of change to the system\n\n85\n00:04:14.915 --> 00:04:19.055\nor modification in any way,\nyour backup should be running here, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:21.996\nAll right,\nyou might have to determine too, and\n\n87\n00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:26.640\nagain I know I'm kinda sticking\non backups real quick, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.230\nBut backups, if you have to take backups,\n\n89\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.850\nis data recovery gonna be\nrequired by a third party?\n\n90\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.610\nIs that's something that's\neven provided by your company\n\n91\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.830\nas an A+ help desk technician?\n\n92\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.410\nRight, maybe that's something\nyou can do internally.\n\n93\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.430\nYou could say, well,\nhey we're gonna have to do such and such.\n\n94\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.050\nI'm gonna make a potential change\nhere that could cause a problem.\n\n95\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.770\nWe might need to back up your data.\n\n96\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.640\nHowever, we also have\na data recovery solution or\n\n97\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.310\nyou might have to recommend one, okay?\n\n98\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.770\nNow once the theory is confirmed,\n\n99\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.750\ndetermine the next steps to resolve\nwhatever the problem might be.\n\n100\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.155\nIf I figure out, hey, it is,\nright, I get on that third\n\n101\n00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:11.145\nstep if I determine that it is\nsome kind of overheating issue.\n\n102\n00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:16.060\nWell, then I have to make sure\nwhat the next steps might be.\n\n103\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.810\nHowever, keep in mind if we're testing\nthe theory and it's not confirmed,\n\n104\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.410\nthen what we're gonna have to do is we're\ngonna have to reestablish a new theory.\n\n105\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.540\nAnd that's the other thing that\nwe also wanna keep in mind.\n\n106\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.840\nWhen we talk about establishing\na theory of probable cause,\n\n107\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.140\nback in the second step,\n\n108\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.260\nwe did that in the first part of this\nlittle series that we got going on here.\n\n109\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.080\nMake sure that you establish\nmultiple points of probable cause.\n\n110\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.550\nDon't just stop with one.\n\n111\n00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.310\nAnd why do I say that?\n\n112\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.250\nCuz if you stop with one,\n\n113\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.200\nyou're gonna have to go back to\nthe drawing board more and more often.\n\n114\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.100\nSo come to the table prepared.\n\n115\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.990\nCome to the table with more\nthan one potential cause so\n\n116\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.650\nthat you can systematically work through\nthis, you have a systematic approach.\n\n117\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.700\nYou could work through each one,\nall right?\n\n118\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.487\nBut if you work through each one and\nagain, the theory is not confirmed,\n\n119\n00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:02.823\njust re-establish a new theory.\n\n120\n00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:06.840\nOr maybe it's not within your wheelhouse.\n\n121\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.770\nIf it's not within your wheelhouse,\nladies and\n\n122\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.240\ngentlemen, it is not a bad\nthing to say I don't know.\n\n123\n00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.150\nWhat is a bad thing is to say I know and\nthen not know, cuz you're held accountable\n\n124\n00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.110\nfor what you say you know,\nwhether you do or you don't, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.180\nAnd that's one of the things.\n\n126\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.440\nLet me give you an example.\n\n127\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.890\nIf it's an electrical issue, right, if\nit's an electrical issue within the power\n\n128\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.100\nsupply, I know enough to know that I\nshouldn't be opening a power supply,\n\n129\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.520\nbecause they have capacitors in them that\ncan retain enough amperage whether they're\n\n130\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.460\nworking or\nnot to kill you when you touch them.\n\n131\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.330\nStop your heart instantly.\n\n132\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.830\nAll right, so what I recognize is that\nif it's a power supply problem, yeah,\n\n133\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.040\nI can fix it by replacing\nthe power supply, not opening it.\n\n134\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.790\nBut if it happens to be the electrical\noutlet on the wall that's the problem,\n\n135\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.850\nI also have enough knowledge to know that\nI need to escalate that to an electrical\n\n136\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.330\nengineer, an electrician.\n\n137\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.308\nSomebody that has the know how to fix\nthat outlet on the wall, not Wes.\n\n138\n00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:01.833\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny you're actually\n\n139\n00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:04.325\npointing over there because that's\na dead socket you just pointed at.\n\n140\n00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:05.259\nI found that out this morning.\n\n141\n00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.113\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's really,\n\n142\n00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:06.910\nthat's funny, that's funny [LAUGH].\n\n143\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.780\nAnd I didn't even know that.\n\n144\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.230\nSo the socket that we're theoretically,\nin reality pointing to,\n\n145\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.470\nis a dead socket, right?\n\n146\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.341\nSo I would go to our facilities manager,\nright,\n\n147\n00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.782\nthe guy that helps keep these\nlights on in the background.\n\n148\n00:07:19.782 --> 00:07:22.670\nYou probably don't even realize it,\nMr. Nate Copeland.\n\n149\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.550\nAnd Nate also knows when he needs to\nhire and contract an outside source to\n\n150\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.020\ncome in here and fix a problem that's\njust not in his wheel house, right?\n\n151\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.630\nEscalation is not a bad thing, right?\n\n152\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.280\nNow keep in mind,\n\n153\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.480\nyou just repeat the topics above\nuntil you find a potential solution.\n\n154\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.710\nIf you think it's a solution, that's\nwhere we get into, well, the next step.\n\n155\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.567\nSo the next step that we have after\ntesting a theory to determine a cause,\n\n156\n00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:52.107\nkeep in mind all those\nthings that we just said.\n\n157\n00:07:52.107 --> 00:07:55.194\nOnce a theory is confirmed, determine\nthe next steps to resolve the problem.\n\n158\n00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:59.201\nIf it's not confirmed, Start over again\nwell that's all to test the theory\n\n159\n00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:03.331\nto determine the cause but the next one we\nhave to move on is to establish a plan of\n\n160\n00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:06.880\naction and resolve the problem and\nimplement the solution.\n\n161\n00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.470\nNow I want you to keep in mind,\nthis is kinda two steps in one.\n\n162\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.353\nIt's on the same playground, play level\nif you will, it's on an even field here.\n\n163\n00:08:15.353 --> 00:08:20.114\nSo you wanna keep in mind that in the exam\nobjectives when you are going to take this\n\n164\n00:08:20.114 --> 00:08:22.215\nexam that the establishing a plan or\n\n165\n00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:27.690\na plan of action is the same level playing\nground as implementing the solution.\n\n166\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.190\nBut once I know what the cause is, and\nI know that I'm gonna implement that\n\n167\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.950\nsolution, now I step back and say,\nokay how am I gonna approach this?\n\n168\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.440\nI'm replacing the CPU\nbecause it's overheating or\n\n169\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.810\nreplacing the cooling system.\n\n170\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.840\nWell how am I gonna go about doing that?\n\n171\n00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.570\nI know that's the solution.\n\n172\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.145\nI looked in the bios its supposed to\nbe for instance to give you and example\n\n173\n00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:54.473\nthe fans that run on top of a heat sync\nI've seen them go up to almost 5,000 RPMs.\n\n174\n00:08:54.473 --> 00:08:58.263\nThey're supposed to be able to handle a\ncertain threshold, and if I look at it and\n\n175\n00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:01.385\nI can see that the internal core\ntemperature of the CPU is rising and\n\n176\n00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:03.616\nthat fan is staying at around 1,000 RPMs,\n\n177\n00:09:03.616 --> 00:09:06.280\nI know that there's something\nprobably wrong with it.\n\n178\n00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.490\nMaybe it's not accepting the voltage.\n\n179\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.090\nSo if I gotta replace a fan,\nI gotta come back with a solution.\n\n180\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.340\nOnce I know that that's the solution,\nI have to say, okay,\n\n181\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.340\nfirst thing I have to do is determine\nis this computer under warranty?\n\n182\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.025\nIf it is, let them fix it.\n\n183\n00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:20.371\n[LAUGH] Let the people that\nyou're paying the warranty,\n\n184\n00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:21.430\nthat's why you got a warranty, right?\n\n185\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.545\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n186\n00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.630\n&gt;&gt; Don't become a tech if you\ndon't have to, let them fix it.\n\n187\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.270\nOr, I made the product.\n\n188\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.340\nTake it back, I said,\nokay, gotta take this out,\n\n189\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.440\nI gotta determine that\nthere's gonna be downtime.\n\n190\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.230\nIn a home environment\nthat's not a bad thing.\n\n191\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.962\nIt's always frustrating,\ndon't downplay somebody else's problem,\n\n192\n00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:42.870\nthat's another worst\nthing that you can do.\n\n193\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.018\nIt's certainly not good and\nprofessionalism.\n\n194\n00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:45.860\nThis isn't that bad over you.\n\n195\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.355\nYour computer's just gonna be down for\n\n196\n00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.129\na week, but\nwe'll get it back up and running.\n\n197\n00:09:49.129 --> 00:09:52.616\nWell you don't know what that person\ndoes with that computer outside of your\n\n198\n00:09:52.616 --> 00:09:54.690\nexistence just looking and\nworking on them.\n\n199\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.400\nThat could be detrimental to somebody.\n\n200\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.730\nBut even more so if you're working in a\ncorporate enviroment where that's a server\n\n201\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.670\nthat costs somebody about a million\ndollars an hour that it isn't online.\n\n202\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.600\nSo, again, never downplay the solution.\n\n203\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.400\nThe point is, you have to know that.\n\n204\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.540\nYou have to let the end user\nknow to prepare for downtime and\n\n205\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.600\nwhat it's going to take, and if I have to\nreplace this, well, hey, you know what?\n\n206\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.300\nWe can replace it temporarily for\nthis way until this part comes is, or\n\n207\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.780\nmaybe we can't do that at all.\n\n208\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.470\nAgain, you have to plan for that.\n\n209\n00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.470\nAgain, plan those action steps right?\n\n210\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.270\nThat response if you will, the plan\nof action is important, all right.\n\n211\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.850\nLike I said always determine and\n\n212\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.710\nhopefully at this point if your are gonna\nimplement something that could lose\n\n213\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.590\nthe data, you've all ready\nimplemented your back ups, all right?\n\n214\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.132\nCuz at this point this is your last step\nto make sure that your user data stays\n\n215\n00:10:41.132 --> 00:10:42.270\nprotective all right.\n\n216\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.042\nNow the other thing I want\nyou to keep in mind is that,\n\n217\n00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:49.330\nas we are gonna start probably trying at\nthis point to do some reconfigurations or\n\n218\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.051\nto do some kind of testing, or\nnot testing, to implement a solution,\n\n219\n00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:56.390\nI want you to step back and\nthink about the software, okay?\n\n220\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.070\nAnd the reason I mean the software\nis can the software be reinstalled?\n\n221\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.750\nAll right, let's say Zach brings\nhis computer to me, all right.\n\n222\n00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:08.640\nAs host and subject matter experts at work\nhere at ITProTV, we rely on our computers.\n\n223\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.830\nOur work, our livelihood is\nin our computers, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.520\nNow I want you to think a scenario where\nmaybe Zach doesn't maybe I'm the helpdesk.\n\n225\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.760\nAnd Zach, okay so same scenario.\n\n226\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.847\nMaybe we work in a different line\nof business where we don't have Ten\n\n227\n00:11:22.847 --> 00:11:25.440\ntechs here at any given\ntime that can help.\n\n228\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.343\nAll right,\nZach brings his computer to me and\n\n229\n00:11:27.343 --> 00:11:29.696\nI say yeah Zach you've have\ngot a pretty nasty bug on it,\n\n230\n00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:33.070\nwere probably gonna have to\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n231\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.904\nOkay, well if you go and reinstall the\noperating system, does Zach an appropriate\n\n232\n00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:39.943\nlicense, for the new reinstallation\nof that operating system?\n\n233\n00:11:39.943 --> 00:11:41.620\nYou say well wait a second, it's a Mac.\n\n234\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.880\nThat's okay, but its a Windows,\nits a Windows machine.\n\n235\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.080\nDo you have the appropriate license?\n\n236\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.578\nOr if I reinstall the operating system and\nback, Mack, excuse me, Mack and Zack.\n\n237\n00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:52.950\nBoy, they rhyme and\nI'm not gonna get it right.\n\n238\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Zack paid $400 for\n\n239\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.810\na piece of software that he's got his\ncomputer that he's got a one use license,\n\n240\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.170\nI reinstall the operating system,\nit formats that piece of software.\n\n241\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.620\nNow Zack's out $400, or he just lost\nhis program because he doesn't have\n\n242\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.200\nan initial license to reinstall the\nsoftware after the fact and keep it use.\n\n243\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.832\nSo, again you have to keep it sign\nthat's why the plan of action is very,\n\n244\n00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:13.795\nvery important, right?\n\n245\n00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:15.560\nAre there license concerns?\n\n246\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.390\nCan I lose this piece of software,\nreinstall it and is it applicable?\n\n247\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.360\nAgain EOAs,\ndigital rights management, Zach.\n\n248\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.350\nYou were with me when we\ntalked about this one, right?\n\n249\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.250\nWe stressed the fact that it could\ncost your money thousands of dollars.\n\n250\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.231\nThis could be the time that you cost an\nend user their livelihood and $400 right?\n\n251\n00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:36.243\nMoney's always relative to\npeople who have it or don't.\n\n252\n00:12:36.243 --> 00:12:39.424\nAre additional cost acceptable?\n\n253\n00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:44.315\nYou can't just assume they are,\neven if that's what's required, so\n\n254\n00:12:44.315 --> 00:12:47.260\nthat also influences your plan of action.\n\n255\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:54.900\nWell Zack, I know your child spilled\nsome water on it, it's gonna cost you.\n\n256\n00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.670\nWe're gonna have to pay for\nthe mother board,\n\n257\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.410\nit's gonna be another $800 well\nis an additional cost acceptable?\n\n258\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.930\nThat might not be acceptable to\nthe end user, the end user might say,\n\n259\n00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.500\nwell at this point $800?\n\n260\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.512\nI know I can go over to\nthis local company and\n\n261\n00:13:07.512 --> 00:13:11.040\nI can buy a brand new laptop for\n$400, right?\n\n262\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.806\nIt might not be the one I want right now,\nbut\n\n263\n00:13:12.806 --> 00:13:15.620\naccording to the money that I have\nthat's all I can afford to spend.\n\n264\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.900\nSo additional cost, might affect what your\nsolution is too cuz it would be nice to\n\n265\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:26.646\nsay okay hey you know what I need\na new car, all right I'll go ahead and\n\n266\n00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:32.030\nget a Mercedes I'll go out and\nget a BMW right or a Lamborghini for\n\n267\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.547\nthose of you who like cars\n&gt;&gt; Yugo I'll get a Yugo\n\n268\n00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:34.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Zach and\n\n269\n00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.240\nI live on a working man's salary\nyou're gonna be like can I go out and\n\n270\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.284\nget me a Kia, can I go out and\nget Zach just give Yugo, right?\n\n271\n00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:46.190\nOne of our other hosts could probably\nbuy five cars for that price, too.\n\n272\n00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:51.130\nSo, again, you have to understand,\nit's not just easy to\n\n273\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.610\nsay if additional costs are there,\nis it acceptable, right?\n\n274\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.157\nAgain, and here's the last points,\n\n275\n00:13:58.157 --> 00:14:03.580\nwhere your plan of action Might allow you\nthe ability to escalate the situation.\n\n276\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.252\nCuz remember, you're gonna implement\nsome kind of solution here,\n\n277\n00:14:07.252 --> 00:14:11.684\nthat's the other side of this playing\nfield, is that you implement the solution,\n\n278\n00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:15.695\nyou know it's a solution, but\nyou don't have the skills to implement it.\n\n279\n00:14:15.695 --> 00:14:20.380\nRemember, you're gonna be responsible for\nwhat you say, and you know it.\n\n280\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.900\nIf you say you know okay, and\nI say there's a reason I stress on this is\n\n281\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.900\nbecause I've worked in a construction\nindustry on and off for many years.\n\n282\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.638\nI mean I have in a many years\nthank goodness for IT and\n\n283\n00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:34.079\nlearning computers is one of\nthe reason where in the computers so\n\n284\n00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:38.241\nthat I can maintain a little bit of my\nlower back for the later years of my life.\n\n285\n00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:42.521\nBut I did see a young guy when I was\non a concrete crew one time, and\n\n286\n00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:44.220\nhe was a know-it-all.\n\n287\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.826\nAnd he would say, I know, I know.\n\n288\n00:14:45.826 --> 00:14:49.640\nAnd one of the older masons that was\non there definitely did know his stuff.\n\n289\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.314\nHe'd been a mason for 30 years.\n\n290\n00:14:51.314 --> 00:14:54.933\nSo he'd definitely seen his,\nit wasn't his first rodeo.\n\n291\n00:14:54.933 --> 00:14:58.664\nAnd he was telling this guy, hey, this is\nthe way you need to put down this very,\n\n292\n00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.952\nvery massive,\nmassively heavy pre-cast, and\n\n293\n00:15:00.952 --> 00:15:04.410\nit was on just this little\nfour inch by four inch lock.\n\n294\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.130\nAnd the kid kept saying,\nI know how to do it.\n\n295\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.260\nI know, I know, I know.\n\n296\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.140\nAnd he just didn't listen.\n\n297\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.549\nAnd when he set it down, we almost dropped\na 2,000 to 3,000 pound pre-cast on 5 guys.\n\n298\n00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:12.170\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n299\n00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n300\n00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.580\ndon't say you know if you don't, escalates\nright give it to somebody that does.\n\n301\n00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.459\nLike if there was networking problems\nwithin this network right now, yeah,\n\n302\n00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:26.109\nI understand the concepts but\nI don't know the setup behind the scenes.\n\n303\n00:15:26.109 --> 00:15:27.705\nI'm gonna take that to somebody\nSomebody like Nate Copeland.\n\n304\n00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:30.505\nI'm gonna take that to something like\none of our other host, Ronnie Wong or\n\n305\n00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:35.025\nDon Pezet, who know, have a very\nintricate knowledge of this network.\n\n306\n00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:36.757\nIt's not because that I couldn't do it.\n\n307\n00:15:36.757 --> 00:15:39.547\nIt's just because they could do\nit quickly, efficiently, and\n\n308\n00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.830\nthey know the network right so\nescalation, right?\n\n309\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.870\nAll right let's go ahead we'll take a look\nI know we are still moving along here,\n\n310\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.610\nlet's take a look at the next\none in the list, right?\n\n311\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.380\nVerifying four system\nfunctionality if applicable,\n\n312\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.374\nimplement,preventative measures.\n\n313\n00:15:55.374 --> 00:15:58.929\nNotice that in the last two\nsteps that we've talked about,\n\n314\n00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:01.641\nthey are really got\nalmost two parts to them.\n\n315\n00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:04.040\nRight, even though, again,\nit's just one step,\n\n316\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.720\nthere really are two different\nsides to this, all right.\n\n317\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.952\nSo verifying full system functionality,\nall right.\n\n318\n00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:14.590\nThere are actually two little points I\nwant to make right here at just this side.\n\n319\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.670\nVerifying full system functionality\nis not only verifying that\n\n320\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.420\nyou know it's full system functionality.\n\n321\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.300\nI've been using Zack.\n\n322\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.389\nThank you for being a good sport and\nletting me use you as an example, and\n\n323\n00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:25.270\nmaybe having an issue on your laptop.\n\n324\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.280\nI know I fixed Zack's computer,\nyou know why?\n\n325\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.470\nCuz I fixed, and I'm using it.\n\n326\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.620\nBut I wouldn't be doing Zack\nany justice if I didn't say,\n\n327\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.080\nZack, get in there and look around, right.\n\n328\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.810\nAre your files there?\n\n329\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.820\nI don't know.\n\n330\n00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.650\nI shouldn't,\nwe talked about privacy concerns.\n\n331\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.180\nYou shouldn't be looking at anybody's\nfiles anyways, and I'm not going to be.\n\n332\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.760\nBut I know that the computer's working.\n\n333\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.259\nBut Zach goes, wait a second, Wes.\n\n334\n00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:49.190\nYeah, yeah,\neverything's working just fine.\n\n335\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.900\nBut I've got five years of pictures\nof my kids that I can't find.\n\n336\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:59.067\nWell, wait a second,\nyou did a reset of the PC, right.\n\n337\n00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:00.500\nWhere are your backups?\n\n338\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.670\nDid you restore your backups?\n\n339\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.610\nYeah, the functionality's there, but it's\nnot restored to what the end user wants.\n\n340\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.180\nSo understanding verifying full system\nfunctionality doesn't mean just\n\n341\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.990\nyou as a tech verify that there's\nfull system functionality.\n\n342\n00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.129\nYou make sure that the end user verifies\nfull system functionality, too,\n\n343\n00:17:17.129 --> 00:17:18.909\ncuz it's as important to them.\n\n344\n00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:21.998\nRight, it's not only important to you\nas a tech and you as your company, but\n\n345\n00:17:21.998 --> 00:17:23.992\nkeep in mind that this is\nalso reputation based.\n\n346\n00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:25.655\nAnd if you want to bring\ncustomers back to you,\n\n347\n00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:27.412\nyou need to make sure\nthe customer is satisfied.\n\n348\n00:17:27.412 --> 00:17:33.305\nAnd the way you do that is verifying\nsystem functionality with the end user,\n\n349\n00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:34.950\nright.\n\n350\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.622\nHow many times,\nhave you ever had somebody,\n\n351\n00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.031\nand you know that it's good service?\n\n352\n00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:40.631\nWhatever it is that they come over and\nthey fix in your house, right.\n\n353\n00:17:40.631 --> 00:17:43.230\nWe had one guy come over and he.\n\n354\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.720\nI don't know anything about dryers,\nbut a gentleman came over and\n\n355\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.278\nhe fixed my dryer, right.\n\n356\n00:17:48.278 --> 00:17:51.200\nWell, he turned it on, he let it run.\n\n357\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.848\nAnd he let it run for a half hour.\n\n358\n00:17:54.848 --> 00:17:55.630\nWhy?\n\n359\n00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.600\nWell, he wasn't just verifying\nthat it was functional.\n\n360\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.477\nHe wanted to make sure that\nthe heat was getting up there.\n\n361\n00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:01.375\nAnd then he made me come over there and\n\n362\n00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:05.890\nput my hand in the dryer to verify after\na half hour that it was still hot.\n\n363\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.700\nHe was making sure that I\nwas happy as a customer.\n\n364\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.052\nAnd I most definitely will go\nback to them because of that,\n\n365\n00:18:11.052 --> 00:18:12.351\nbecause they were really good.\n\n366\n00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:16.095\nSo understand that also for reputation\nbase, not just the troubleshooting method\n\n367\n00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.929\nbut for your own reputation,\nthe reputation of your company,\n\n368\n00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:22.213\nverify that the full system functionality\nalso satisfies the end user.\n\n369\n00:18:22.213 --> 00:18:26.637\nNow, here's the other one [LAUGH],\nmaybe not so satisfying to the end user,\n\n370\n00:18:26.637 --> 00:18:32.140\nis making sure that preventative measures,\nif applicable, are implemented.\n\n371\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.730\nThings can be situational, right.\n\n372\n00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.970\nYou can have a problem that does\nmanifest itself because of, well,\n\n373\n00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.790\nwhat we call the ID10T error, right.\n\n374\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.090\nThe layer eight issue for\n\n375\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.180\nthose of you [LAUGH] that\nare going on to networking, right.\n\n376\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.285\nThat's the user layer.\n\n377\n00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:49.996\n[LAUGH] The problem could exist between\nthe keyboard and the chair, right,\n\n378\n00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:50.978\nPEBCAK issue.\n\n379\n00:18:50.978 --> 00:18:52.730\nIt could be the end user\nthat's the problem.\n\n380\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:53.654\nI'm getting to the point.\n\n381\n00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:56.352\nAll right, it doesn't mean that\nyou have to be judgmental.\n\n382\n00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:59.500\nIt doesn't have to mean that\nthat you need to be bombastic.\n\n383\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.310\nBut you're preventative measures\ncould be educating the end user.\n\n384\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.341\nAnd let me tell you what I mean by that,\nall right.\n\n385\n00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:08.320\nI've seen plenty of people that\nhave a nice computer desk.\n\n386\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.940\nBut one of the things that they don't\nrealize is they set that computer all\n\n387\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.270\nthe way back to the edge of a shelf,\nall the way back to the end.\n\n388\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.289\nAnd guess what?\n\n389\n00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:21.830\nThe back side of the desk\nis blocked completely off.\n\n390\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.069\nWell, guess what?\n\n391\n00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:28.530\nThe ATX form factor today is one of\nthe most common, even if it's a micro ATX.\n\n392\n00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.090\nThere are different sizes of ATX.\n\n393\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.725\nIt's one of the most common\nform factors for desktop PCs.\n\n394\n00:19:33.725 --> 00:19:38.030\nGuess what you do when you slide that\ncomputer all the way to the back and\n\n395\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.110\nit meets up with a blank or\n\n396\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.860\na solid whatever, it could be\nparticle board, whatever, solid back?\n\n397\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.800\nYou block off the exhaust vent.\n\n398\n00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.890\nYou cripple the cooling system.\n\n399\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.430\nWhen you cripple the cooling system,\nyou start to build up thermal heat, right,\n\n400\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.650\nheat inside of the system.\n\n401\n00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.310\nAnd it causes thermal damage, right.\n\n402\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.390\nSo you have to educate the end user.\n\n403\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.550\nPreventive measures might be saying, yeah,\nyou can probably do a little bit better,\n\n404\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.200\njust kinda pulling that computer\nforward a little bit, right.\n\n405\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.780\nAs much as they call it a laptop,\n\n406\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.390\nsometimes you don't wanna\nput a laptop in your lap.\n\n407\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.969\nCuz guess what?\n\n408\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.860\nThe exhaust vents sometimes are on\nthe bottom of the laptop, right.\n\n409\n00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.980\nAnd laptop manufacturers got really\ngood about putting them on the back\n\n410\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.800\nside of the system.\n\n411\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.510\nBut if I set that laptop up on\na blanket on a bed, which happens, and\n\n412\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.290\nI block off the back of that\nside of that laptop, guess what?\n\n413\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.060\nI've also crippled the cooling system.\n\n414\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.950\nThermal management, right, so\nit can lead to overheating.\n\n415\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.040\nThings like preventative measures says,\nhey,\n\n416\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.030\nyou should be scheduling a virus scan,\nright.\n\n417\n00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.480\nMaybe it happened to be malware.\n\n418\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.151\nMaybe that's all it is, just malware,\nand you took the malware off the system.\n\n419\n00:20:44.151 --> 00:20:46.057\nWell, let the end user know, all right.\n\n420\n00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:47.627\nThere's a schedule that we run.\n\n421\n00:20:47.627 --> 00:20:53.400\nIf not,\npreventative measures educate the user.\n\n422\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.290\nWalk them through the part.\n\n423\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:59.088\nJust say, hey, click this,\nevery once in a while, right.\n\n424\n00:20:59.088 --> 00:20:59.870\nSoft sale.\n\n425\n00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.381\nCall us, we'll come back and do it, right.\n\n426\n00:21:03.381 --> 00:21:08.770\nHey, you need to get the machine serviced\nevery six months because of dust, right.\n\n427\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.191\nYou're in Florida, and, Zack,\nI know you're like me, allergies.\n\n428\n00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:13.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We know about some dust, right, and\n\n429\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.009\npollen, right.\n\n430\n00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:20.020\nWell, these airborne particles, right,\nthey can cripple a computer completely.\n\n431\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.090\nWe don't just have dust bunnies, we got\nentire bears to live inside a computer.\n\n432\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.564\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\ndust bears, absolutely.\n\n433\n00:21:26.564 --> 00:21:28.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwe have to worry about that, too.\n\n434\n00:21:28.528 --> 00:21:32.487\nAnd it might be just something where,\nagain, preventative measures could be,\n\n435\n00:21:32.487 --> 00:21:34.070\nmaybe the user is smart enough.\n\n436\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.042\nAnd what I mean by that is because you\nsay, well, smart enough, Wes, here you go,\n\n437\n00:21:37.042 --> 00:21:37.860\nyou're talking now.\n\n438\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.260\nNo, I'm not, but you used compressed air.\n\n439\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.269\nSome people might just get in there and\nspray,\n\n440\n00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:44.752\nkeep the nozzle down until\nthey're condensing the air.\n\n441\n00:21:44.752 --> 00:21:46.911\nAnd now you're blowing water\nacross the electrical component.\n\n442\n00:21:46.911 --> 00:21:51.140\nAnd they might not know to turn it\noff first and unplug it, right.\n\n443\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.220\nBut, again, bring it to our place,\nbring it to our shop.\n\n444\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.784\nRight, if we're a tech company, bring it\nto our shop once every six months and\n\n445\n00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:00.010\nwe'll get the dust out for you, right.\n\n446\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.531\nSo, again, that could be whatever\nthe preventative measure is.\n\n447\n00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:06.138\nPreventative measures could be going\ninto something like task scheduler and\n\n448\n00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:07.587\nrunning the drive optimizer.\n\n449\n00:22:07.587 --> 00:22:11.360\nTest scheduler is kinda run by\ndefault since the days of Vista.\n\n450\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.746\nBut it could be automating a task\nthrough software, as well.\n\n451\n00:22:13.746 --> 00:22:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, you mentioned backups.\n\n452\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.240\nAre they gonna come back into play here?\n\n453\n00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.059\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting cuz you would think.\n\n454\n00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:20.791\nThey mention them in the exam objectives.\n\n455\n00:22:20.791 --> 00:22:25.194\nAnd they say very early on, which again, I\nlike the fact that they are reminding you,\n\n456\n00:22:25.194 --> 00:22:27.470\ntake your backups before you make changes.\n\n457\n00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:31.160\nOne of the things that is kind of a pet\npeeve of mine and not really called out on\n\n458\n00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.570\nthe exam, but I think will benefit\nyou out there in the real world,\n\n459\n00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.660\nis the fact that after you verify\nthe full system functionality, right.\n\n460\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.301\nAnd it could be something where we've\nreinstalled the operating system.\n\n461\n00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:42.889\nIf it happens to be Windows,\nwe've reactivated it.\n\n462\n00:22:42.889 --> 00:22:47.690\nIf you have to reinstall software, you've\nactivated the license, right, at that\n\n463\n00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:52.372\npoint, I might wanna run a backup again,\nright, in the pristine state, right.\n\n464\n00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:55.340\nWe talked about using system\nrestore in other episodes, right.\n\n465\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.480\nWell, you create a restore\npoint before you make changes.\n\n466\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.250\nBut you also have the Windows operating\nsystem doing automatic restore points so\n\n467\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.220\nthat if something goes wrong after a\ncertain amount of time you can roll back.\n\n468\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.215\nWell, once you have full system\nfunctionality, right, and\n\n469\n00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:12.808\nyour machine is good and\nit's running really well and\n\n470\n00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:15.650\nwe don't have any problems with it,\nrerun your backups.\n\n471\n00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.860\nUpdate your backups, right, at that point.\n\n472\n00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.451\nTake a system image so that if in\na week from now, two weeks from now,\n\n473\n00:23:23.451 --> 00:23:27.400\na month from now,\nyou can restore that computer to at least\n\n474\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.212\nthat point in time in case you\nhave issues in the future.\n\n475\n00:23:31.212 --> 00:23:33.770\nSo, yeah, I'm glad you asked that,\nZack, that is right.\n\n476\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.944\nMake sure that you rerun your backups\nafter the full functionality and\n\n477\n00:23:36.944 --> 00:23:39.057\npreventive measures have been implemented.\n\n478\n00:23:39.057 --> 00:23:40.070\nCuz think about it.\n\n479\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.300\nWe talked about removing malware.\n\n480\n00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.837\nWhat was one part removing malware?\n\n481\n00:23:44.837 --> 00:23:47.539\nDisabling system restore, right.\n\n482\n00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:51.725\nAnd then after we quarantine the system,\nwe remove the virus, right.\n\n483\n00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:55.909\nWe re-enable system restore,\nwe created a restore point.\n\n484\n00:23:55.909 --> 00:24:00.536\nNow that we don't have viruses We\nshould run another back up right?\n\n485\n00:24:00.536 --> 00:24:04.280\nSo I do believe that is a perfect\npoint when you have full system\n\n486\n00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.175\nfunctionality and everything's good,\nthat's what we want.\n\n487\n00:24:08.175 --> 00:24:10.710\nLet's take a back up at\nthe good environment so\n\n488\n00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.285\nthat if it becomes haywire of it,\ngives us a problem down the way,\n\n489\n00:24:14.285 --> 00:24:17.153\nwe can always at least restore\nto that point in time.\n\n490\n00:24:17.153 --> 00:24:21.908\nAll right, well, we've got one more and\nlet's go ahead, looks like I've talked so\n\n491\n00:24:21.908 --> 00:24:24.747\nmuch, my computer is kinda\ngoing to sleep here, so\n\n492\n00:24:24.747 --> 00:24:27.279\nwe do have one more that\nwe have to talk about.\n\n493\n00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.730\nSo, let's go ahead we'll\ntake a look at that one.\n\n494\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.870\nThat's document to your findings,\nactions and outcomes.\n\n495\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.076\nThis is important, all right?\n\n496\n00:24:36.076 --> 00:24:37.480\nLet me tell you why.\n\n497\n00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.410\nThis is important for you, as far as\neducation-wise and your resources as\n\n498\n00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.290\nwell as it is important for you company,\nand here is the reason right?\n\n499\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.840\nI told you, verify full system\nfunctionality from the end user's\n\n500\n00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.900\nstandpoint because that ensures\nthat the customer is happy.\n\n501\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.270\nNow it's about protecting you.\n\n502\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.259\nWhy do I mean that?\n\n503\n00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:59.170\nWell Zach tells me, Wes,\nyeah we're good to go.\n\n504\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.260\nEverything's fine.\n\n505\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.160\nI need to get that in writing.\n\n506\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.640\nI need to document it.\n\n507\n00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.750\nI also need to document the steps\nthat I took to get to that point.\n\n508\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.506\nWhy?\n\n509\n00:25:06.506 --> 00:25:08.543\nWell what happens if you\ncome across that again?\n\n510\n00:25:08.543 --> 00:25:11.680\nMaybe it's not Zach, right again,\nI'll stop picking on Zach here.\n\n511\n00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.770\nMaybe user B comes in, right.\n\n512\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.900\nUser A, Zach come in, we've taken care of\nthis situation, I document everything.\n\n513\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.330\nI document what I thought the problem was,\nwhat were the symptoms of the problem,\n\n514\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.200\nright, what I thought the theory was.\n\n515\n00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.870\nAnd then maybe I don't even do that, maybe\nI say okay, well this is what it looked\n\n516\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:36.550\nlike but this is what it was, and then how\nI resolved it and what the outcome was.\n\n517\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.830\nWell guess what?\n\n518\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.620\nWhat do you think you're doing if\nyou use an external source and\n\n519\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.750\nyou go to a blog, and you're\nreviewing what they've gone through?\n\n520\n00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.560\nWell guess what they did?\n\n521\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:51.290\nThat blog is created on documenting\nthe outcomes of troubleshooting.\n\n522\n00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.790\nAnd it helped solve the issue for you.\n\n523\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.190\nYour documentation is\na blueprint of your experience.\n\n524\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.830\nThink of it that way.\n\n525\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.430\nYour documentation is a blueprint of your\nexperience, and the more documentation you\n\n526\n00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.560\nhave, the more experience you\nhave to rely on in the future.\n\n527\n00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.400\nIf you don't document it, then you're\ndoomed to repeat the same steps again and\n\n528\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.040\nagain and again and again.\n\n529\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.117\nAnd I think that's somewhere along the\nlines of what Einstein said insanity was.\n\n530\n00:26:15.117 --> 00:26:16.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly right.\n\n531\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwe have to watch that, right?\n\n532\n00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:25.230\nKeep that in mind, document what\nyou're doing because I wish, okay?\n\n533\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.690\nAnd how many people document stuff?\n\n534\n00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.230\nI'm not really raising\nmy hands here right?\n\n535\n00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.716\nI wish there were things that,\nin the company that I used to work for\n\n536\n00:26:33.716 --> 00:26:37.190\nwhere I was doing Dell\nwarranty calls all the time.\n\n537\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.101\nI would've documented some of this stuff,\nright?\n\n538\n00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:43.665\nI will tell you one thing that I do,\nwhen I come across machines,\n\n539\n00:26:43.665 --> 00:26:45.530\nespecially like Dell machines.\n\n540\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.850\nI've got a Dell account that I've\nbasically put in service numbers for\n\n541\n00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.220\nall of the machines that I've\nserviced over the years.\n\n542\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.670\nAnd I could go right back to Dell's\nwebsite and I could review those, and\n\n543\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.170\nI have all the driver packages for\n\n544\n00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.830\nall the various Windows systems\nthroughout the years, right?\n\n545\n00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.180\nSo at least that's a start.\n\n546\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:02.977\nWrite them down.\n\n547\n00:27:02.977 --> 00:27:05.253\nIf your company doesn't\nrequire you to do this,\n\n548\n00:27:05.253 --> 00:27:07.260\ncuz it might be part\nof your warranty work.\n\n549\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.840\nSo it might be part documentational.\n\n550\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.535\nA lot a times its the part of not only\nsubmitting a help desk ticket, but\n\n551\n00:27:13.535 --> 00:27:15.059\nactually resolving.\n\n552\n00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:18.209\nAnd finishing and\nclosing customer support information,\n\n553\n00:27:18.209 --> 00:27:22.880\nthe helpdesk ticketing system as well so\nyour company might require you to do it.\n\n554\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.850\nBut again like I said, it's also important\nin a year because you can turn around,\n\n555\n00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.400\nyou can look back at it,\nmight be a year later you can say,\n\n556\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.180\nyeah you know what I did come across,\nit's not the same CPU right?\n\n557\n00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.220\nBut I remember that the AMD Phenom II\nhad that problem a few years ago.\n\n558\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.727\nAnd this is, I mean it's not an old,\nold system, but this is an AMD FX,\n\n559\n00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.730\nmaybe it might have that problem right?\n\n560\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.976\nOr maybe it was an i3 series Intel that I\nwas having that problem with the CPU, and\n\n561\n00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:53.411\nthis an i7, while they're not exactly\nthe same CPU's, boy I've see that problem\n\n562\n00:27:53.411 --> 00:27:57.120\nbefore and it really had nothing to\ndo with the CPU it's a fan problem.\n\n563\n00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.360\nYou just don't know right, and\nthat's why you go to external sources, but\n\n564\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.640\nthey also said go to internal sources.\n\n565\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.407\nBe your own internal source all right.\n\n566\n00:28:07.407 --> 00:28:12.104\nAgain, your documentation is always\na blueprint of your experience and\n\n567\n00:28:12.104 --> 00:28:15.492\nit can help save you\na tremendous amount of time, and\n\n568\n00:28:15.492 --> 00:28:20.180\nresearch later down the road if\nyou've already come to this problem.\n\n569\n00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.740\nSo keep those in mind, six steps.\n\n570\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.340\nKnow the adjacencies of the ideas,\nmemorize them forwards and backwards, and\n\n571\n00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.080\nI do mean that.\n\n572\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.150\nI remember when I was studying for\nthe A+ exam, I would write them down and\n\n573\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.700\nthen I'd write them backwards.\n\n574\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.010\nI'd write them down, and\nthen I'd write them backwards, right?\n\n575\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.610\nAnd I just kept doing that\nuntil finally I had them so\n\n576\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.420\nmemorized that it didn't matter which\nof the questions they would ask me.\n\n577\n00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.320\nI knew what the next step was\nin fact I could tell you and\n\n578\n00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.738\nquote what the step prior to that was so\nI knew where they were and\n\n579\n00:28:49.738 --> 00:28:53.435\nat any point in any scenario in\nthe Comp TIA troubleshooting model.\n\n580\n00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:56.845\n&gt;&gt; Awesome advice and\ngreat presentation, West.\n\n581\n00:28:56.845 --> 00:28:59.755\nSo Comp TIA troubleshooting theory part\ntwo there isn't part one make sure\n\n582\n00:28:59.755 --> 00:29:00.824\nsure to watch both of them.\n\n583\n00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:03.426\nAnd, in fact,\nwatch everything all the videos.\n\n584\n00:29:03.426 --> 00:29:08.460\nIn the Comp TIA + 902 series,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n585\n00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.820\nAnd by the way, thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n586\n00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.680\nAnd remember,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n587\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.300\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n588\n00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.530\n&gt;&gt;
