exam.\n\n3\n00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.780\nWe'd like to take a moment and\ntell you, what is the A+ 220-901 exam?\n\n4\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.772\nWho is this course for, what will be\ncovered and what are the exam details?\n\n5\n00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:26.647\nWhat is A+ 220-901?\n\n6\n00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:31.051\nWell, the A+ 220-901 is a vendor\nneutral certification in\n\n7\n00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.842\nthe fact that you will be learning\na great many different technologies and\n\n8\n00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:39.350\nnot any one technology\nfrom any specific vendor.\n\n9\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.520\nIt's also a worldwide accreditation.\n\n10\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.430\nWhich means that if you are here\nin the United States and\n\n11\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.885\nyou earn a certification,\n\n12\n00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:50.330\nyour certification is just as valid as if\nyou earned it in Barcelona, Spain per se.\n\n13\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.274\nAlso understand that it is not\nonly a worldwide accreditation,\n\n14\n00:00:56.274 --> 00:01:01.447\nit's also DOD compliant for\nthe 8140 objective and\n\n15\n00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:04.542\n8570.01-mcompliant.\n\n16\n00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.230\nWho is this course for?\n\n17\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.370\nWell, this course is for\n\n18\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.010\nany candidate that requires validation\nof common hardware and software skills.\n\n19\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.465\nIt's also for the candidate\nthat needs an understanding of\n\n20\n00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:19.446\nthe basic concepts within\nany IT infrastructure.\n\n21\n00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:24.711\nCandidates that need to be able to\nperform troubleshooting and networking,\n\n22\n00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:30.150\nas well as basic IT security should\nbe seeking the 220-901 objectives.\n\n23\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.061\nCandidates who are preparing\nto take the current A+ exam.\n\n24\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.690\nWhat are some of the things that'll\nbe covered inside of 220-901?\n\n25\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.117\nWell we'll be looking specifically at\nthe objectives that are called out for\n\n26\n00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:49.135\nCompTIA on their website for\nexam code 220-901.\n\n27\n00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.943\nWe'll be looking at some of\nthe fundamental software and\n\n28\n00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:56.425\nhardware concepts that you can expect to\nsee inside of your IT infrastructure.\n\n29\n00:01:56.425 --> 00:02:01.126\nWe'll also be looking at some of the basic\nTCP/IP concepts that allow us to move\n\n30\n00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:05.491\ncommunications across the most common\nnetworking technologies today.\n\n31\n00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:08.805\nAnd that being said,\neven the fundamental networking and\n\n32\n00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:14.790\ncommunication technologies will be\nlearned inside of the 220-901 objectives.\n\n33\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.331\nWe'll also be looking at some of\nthe fundamentals of troubleshooting common\n\n34\n00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:21.224\nhardware that you'll see within\nyour computing units today.\n\n35\n00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:28.094\nWhat are some of the exam details that\nyou can expect if you decide to sit\n\n36\n00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:30.337\nthe CompTIA 220-901 exam?\n\n37\n00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:34.287\nWell you're gonna be looking\nat 90 questions, 90 minutes.\n\n38\n00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.519\nKeep in mind that these\nare gonna be multiple choice and\n\n39\n00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.300\nthe fact that you'll have more than\none choice and only one right answer.\n\n40\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.990\nNow, you could also find exam\nquestions that have multiple answers,\n\n41\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.330\nin which they ask you to choose\nmore than just a single answer.\n\n42\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.210\nAnd you might hear things like each\nanswer represents a complete solution.\n\n43\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.500\nYou'll also see additional questions\nlike drag and drops, diagrams,\n\n44\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.370\nthat'll make you determine which of the\nanswers should be placed within a diagram.\n\n45\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.678\nAs well as performance based questions,\nsuch as simulations.\n\n46\n00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:13.646\nOn the 220-901 exam for\nCompTIA's A+ certification,\n\n47\n00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:18.340\nyou'll be required to have a 675 for\nyour passing score.\n\n48\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.534\nAnd that's out of a range from 100 to 900.\n\n49\n00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:27.590\nCurrently, here in US dollars,\nthe exam will cost you $205.\n\n50\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.700\nRecommendations by CompTIA for\nsitting the exam are 6 to 12 months,\n\n51\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.890\neither within a lab environment or hands\non experience within the field itself.\n\n52\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.498\nKeep in mind,\nthat if you would like to be A+ certified,\n\n53\n00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:46.794\nyou don't only take just the 220 exam,\nor 220-901 exam.\n\n54\n00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:50.243\nYou also have to complete and\npass the 902.\n\n55\n00:03:50.243 --> 00:03:52.646\nAnd again, that's the 220-902 exam.\n\n56\n00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:57.818\nBoth passes on the exam are required for\nboth 220-901 and\n\n57\n00:03:57.818 --> 00:04:02.815\n220-902 in order to achieve\nyour A+ certification.\n\n58\n00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:08.480\nIf the A+ certification is something\nthat you want to attempt, well then,\n\n59\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.808\nlook forward to this course and\nsome of the topics you can see within it.\n\n60\n00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:18.452\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

901.\n\n9\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.654\nAnd this is exciting, and\nwe're diving into configure BIOS and\n\n10\n00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:28.895\nUEFI settings with our very own Wes Bryan,\nwho knows more than me.\n\n11\n00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey Zach, how you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.320\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're gonna be looking\nright at configuring our BIOS and\n\n14\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.390\nUEFI settings, and\nI know what you're probably saying.\n\n15\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720\nIf you're getting into the A+ for\nthe first time,\n\n16\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.180\nwhat is this alphabet soup that they are\nfeeding us right here at the beginning?\n\n17\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.670\nBut let's go ahead, and\nlet's define what BIOS and UEFI is.\n\n18\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.840\nAnd then we'll take a look at some of\nthe settings that you can configure.\n\n19\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.740\nNow BIOS is a Basic Input/Output System,\nand\n\n20\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.810\nUEFI is\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n21\n00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.240\nNow, why would we need\nsomething like BIOS?\n\n22\n00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.020\nWell, in the earlier days of computing,\n\n23\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.750\ngoing into probably the later 70s\nwhen hobbyists were bring out of the,\n\n24\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.820\nfor instance universities and\nthese big like, Sun Microsystems.\n\n25\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.660\nYou wanted to be able to have\nyour own small computer.\n\n26\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.800\nBut the problem was in order\nto make that computer work,\n\n27\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.410\nyou had to have programming, right?\n\n28\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.480\nAnd the programmers when\nthey developed the software,\n\n29\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.430\nthey also had to have a good innate\nunderstanding of what the hardware was.\n\n30\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.150\nAnd they had to program each individual\nlittle piece to allow their software\n\n31\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.310\nto control their hardware,\ncuz imagine what an operating system is.\n\n32\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.060\nThat's basically what it does.\n\n33\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.790\nIt allows us to control our hardware.\n\n34\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.540\nNow, the problem with that is every system\nthat would come out, your programmers\n\n35\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.120\nwould have to know all about the hardware\nin order to get the machine started in and\n\n36\n00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.400\nbrought up online.\n\n37\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.913\nSo what BIOS does is,\nit allows us a system independent,\n\n38\n00:01:48.913 --> 00:01:52.588\nif you will,\nway to get our hardware started.\n\n39\n00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:56.044\nGet it stabilized, so\nthat when the operating system loads,\n\n40\n00:01:56.044 --> 00:01:58.508\nit doesn't have to worry\nabout any of that.\n\n41\n00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:03.236\nThe hardware is ready to go,\nit's online, and then BIOS, or UEFI,\n\n42\n00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:08.660\nthey can transition and let the operating\nsystem take over after that.\n\n43\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.090\nIt also means that the software\nprogrammers who are designing\n\n44\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360\nthe operating systems to\ncontrol the hardware,\n\n45\n00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.250\nthey don't have to know in\ndepth what the hardware is.\n\n46\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.650\nWhat they have to do is, they have to make\nsure that their operating system can take\n\n47\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.770\nover, after BIOS does.\n\n48\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.290\nAnd BIOS is something that's gonna\nbe controlled by the manufacturer\n\n49\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.140\nof the hardware.\n\n50\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.440\nSo it makes it really good.\n\n51\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.030\nHardware manufacturers can focus\non things like the BIOS and UEFI.\n\n52\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.670\nAnd the operating system developers,\nthey can work on their operating system.\n\n53\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.700\nSo what's the difference between BIOS and\nUEFI?\n\n54\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.200\nWell, there's a lot of difference in them,\n\n55\n00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.340\nbut basically they're\ndoing the same thing.\n\n56\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.380\nSee, BIOS was written back in the late\n70s, when we had 8-bit systems.\n\n57\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.620\nIt's really an outdated way\nto start your hardware,\n\n58\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.130\nbring it online, and get it stabilized.\n\n59\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.500\nIt also has some limitations, right?\n\n60\n00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.540\nSo later down the road,\nIntel came out with what is known as EFI,\n\n61\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.880\nthe Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n62\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.130\nWell, Intel wanted this\nto eventually become\n\n63\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.800\na standard that everybody could use.\n\n64\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.310\nSo what they did is they tried\nto distinguish their earlier\n\n65\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.510\nEFI from something known as UEFI.\n\n66\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.960\nThey basically handed\nthe standard over to the public.\n\n67\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.429\nAnd in order to differentiate\nfrom the earlier Intel based EFI,\n\n68\n00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.849\nthey called it the Universal\nExtensible Firmware Interface.\n\n69\n00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.690\nNow, these interfaces,\nthey're doing the same thing.\n\n70\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.140\nThey're called firmware.\n\n71\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.450\nAnd again,\nbasically understand that firmware\n\n72\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.920\nis a way that we can bring\nour hardware online.\n\n73\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.940\nGet it stabilized,\n\n74\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.720\nmake sure that the checks are in place in\norder to get the operating system loaded.\n\n75\n00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.500\nAnd then the operating system\ndoesn't have to worry about that.\n\n76\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.560\nSo that's a little bit about our BIOS,\nBasic Input/Output Systems.\n\n77\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.150\nWhat happens is we send a little bit\nof input to different components within\n\n78\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.220\nthe system unit.\n\n79\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.730\nAnd if those components respond back,\nwe get a message back from them that\n\n80\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.350\nwe know that they're there,\npresent and ready to go.\n\n81\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.270\nSo that's a little bit about BIOS.\n\n82\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.282\nAnd again, keep in mind,\n\n83\n00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.720\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface,\npretty much doing the same thing.\n\n84\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.940\nBut the difference is,\nit's the more modern version of BIOS.\n\n85\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.580\n&gt;&gt; So what is some of the information\nthat we can actually see in the BIOS?\n\n86\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.050\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n87\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.840\nA lot of great information\nthat we can see.\n\n88\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.200\nIn fact, let's go ahead and check it out.\n\n89\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.330\nI've got a BIOS pulled up here and\nthis is, you will see this is\n\n90\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.710\nactually a Unified Extensible\nFirmware Interface based system.\n\n91\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.190\nHowever, don't let that bother you.\n\n92\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.660\nBecause every vendor's\na little bit different,\n\n93\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.290\nbut when it comes down to it, a lot of the\ncomponents that you see will look alike.\n\n94\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.570\nThe interface might change a little bit\nin colors and how you interact with it.\n\n95\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.630\nBut for the most part, you're gonna\nsee just about the same information.\n\n96\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.490\nNow, some of the basic component\ninformation that we can look at\n\n97\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.668\nis under for instance, and\nthis BIOS is under general.\n\n98\n00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:55.370\nYou can see, that we see,\nwell, system information.\n\n99\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.140\nWell, what is system information for us?\n\n100\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.080\nWell if you notice,\n\n101\n00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.210\nyou can see things like the BIOS version,\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n102\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.510\nWell, why is that important?\n\n103\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.070\nWell you have what are known as firmware\nupdates, and when we update firmware,\n\n104\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.310\na lot of times what it does is it\nfixes some kind of functionality flaw.\n\n105\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.870\nWe can sometimes even give\nyou more functionality by\n\n106\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.870\nadding a couple of things.\n\n107\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.080\nSo, it is important to understand\nwhat the version of the BIOS is.\n\n108\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.700\nSo as the manufacturer of the hardware\nreleases new firmware platforms or\n\n109\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.810\nupdates if you will, you can tell\nwhether you've got the most current.\n\n110\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.170\nNow I do wanna warn you real quick.\n\n111\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.860\nWhen we talk about the system components\nand we talk about updating your firmware,\n\n112\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.190\nit's also called flashing the BIOS.\n\n113\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.420\nSee, when you think about BIOS,\n\n114\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.650\nBIOS is something that sits in a type\nof memory that's non volatile.\n\n115\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.940\nAnd if you're not familiar with\nnon volatile memory, go over and\n\n116\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.430\ncheck out some of our memory issue,\nor memory episodes if you will.\n\n117\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.740\nRemember non-volatile memory just\nmeans that I don't need an electrical\n\n118\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.980\ncurrent to keep refreshing\nthat information to retain it.\n\n119\n00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.506\nIt also means when I turn the power off,\n\n120\n00:05:57.506 --> 00:06:01.192\nall of that data that's stored\nin it is gonna stay there.\n\n121\n00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:03.880\nIt's not gonna be lost, all right.\n\n122\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.580\nNow here's the thing.\n\n123\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.640\nWith flashing that non-volatile memory,\n\n124\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.340\nyou have to make sure that\nit's never interrupted.\n\n125\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.460\nBecause, if there's let's\nsay an electrical storm,\n\n126\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.750\nif you pull the power\nduring a firmware upgrade,\n\n127\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.030\nyou could cause irreversible damage that\ncould damage the unit so much that, well,\n\n128\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.510\nunfortunately, you might have to\nreplace the entire motherboard.\n\n129\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.390\nSo, be careful when you're flashing BIOS.\n\n130\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.380\nYou can see other information here, too.\n\n131\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.430\nYou can see information for instance,\n\n132\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.510\nabout half way down,\nyou can see things like the RAM, right?\n\n133\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.180\nOur Random Access Memory,\nour system memory.\n\n134\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.600\nAnd I can see for instance,\ninside of this BIOS system information or\n\n135\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.950\nUEFI system information,\nI can see how much is installed.\n\n136\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.970\nI can see what the bus speed is.\n\n137\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.680\nYou can see 1,600 megahertz.\n\n138\n00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.570\nI can see what channel it is.\n\n139\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.680\nI can also see what technology it is.\n\n140\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.810\nThis type of BIOS here gives\nus a lot of good information.\n\n141\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.060\nI could see that it's DDR3 RAM,\nso it's relatively new.\n\n142\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.870\nAnd even more so, I can see where\nthe RAM sticks are installed.\n\n143\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.440\nI can see that I have for instance,\nthree and four on our motherboard.\n\n144\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.460\nThey're not even populated.\n\n145\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.780\nThey don't even have RAM sticks in them.\n\n146\n00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.340\nSo you can see things like that, right?\n\n147\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.260\nWe can see for instance, also things like,\nfor instance, hard drive information.\n\n148\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.590\nYou can see as well,\nthings like your expansion slots.\n\n149\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.400\nBut you could have the ability to control\nother things, like optical drives, and\n\n150\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.160\neven CPU information.\n\n151\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.640\nNow, we've got some different things that\nwe can configure inside of our BIOS.\n\n152\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.860\nSome of those things that we can\nconfigure are things like, for instance,\n\n153\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.310\nour boot sequence.\n\n154\n00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.190\nNow, boot sequence is important, right?\n\n155\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.321\nWhen we look at our boot sequence,\nthis says, where does BIOS look for\n\n156\n00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:44.535\nthe boot record to basically boot\nstrap the operating system, right?\n\n157\n00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:48.120\nTo bring the operating system online.\n\n158\n00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.658\nAnd boot sequence is important.\n\n159\n00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:53.593\nA lot of times, you'll see that the boot\nsequence will start with things like your\n\n160\n00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:54.688\noptical drive first.\n\n161\n00:07:54.688 --> 00:07:59.288\nThen it'll go to things like, for\ninstance, maybe a USB device as well.\n\n162\n00:07:59.288 --> 00:08:02.407\nYou can also see sometimes,\nit might go to an external device.\n\n163\n00:08:02.407 --> 00:08:05.729\nIt could go to things like your\nonboard network interface card,\n\n164\n00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:09.120\nwhich again is your network\nbasically booting from the network.\n\n165\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.930\nFinding an operating system\nstored out there on the network.\n\n166\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.995\nAnd then last, a lot of times last\nin the boot list is the hard drive.\n\n167\n00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:20.815\nSo boot sequence is very, very important\ninside of your operating system or\n\n168\n00:08:20.815 --> 00:08:22.115\ninside of your BIOS.\n\n169\n00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:25.435\nBecause it tells the BIOS,\nthe Basic Input Output System or\n\n170\n00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:29.280\nUEFI, where do I look for\nthis operating system?\n\n171\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.230\nAnd more so, where do I find\nthe little record that allows me to\n\n172\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.960\nboot strap that operating system?\n\n173\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.070\nSo that the operating system once BIOS has\ndone can start to take over the hardware.\n\n174\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.760\nAll right, now there's other things that\nwe can do inside of the configurations in\n\n175\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.320\nBIOS.\n\n176\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.030\nWe can do things like enabling and\ndisabling devices.\n\n177\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.630\nAnd if we look down through here, you\ncan see different things as well, right?\n\n178\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.510\nFor instance, if I get down to System\nConfiguration, I can see that I can do\n\n179\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.380\ndifferent things with our\nintegrated network interface card.\n\n180\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.590\nThat's a network adapter.\n\n181\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.390\nThat's what allows us to communicate\nacross the network, and I can too.\n\n182\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.300\nAnd you can see over here on the other\nside, that I can enable to UEFI stack.\n\n183\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.710\nI can also, I could disable it.\n\n184\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.780\nIf i don't want it to be turned on during\nthe time of boot, I just disable it.\n\n185\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.900\nI can also enable something\nknown as PXE boot.\n\n186\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.830\nAnd we'll get into PXE\nboot a little bit later.\n\n187\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.694\nBut this is a pre-execution environment.\n\n188\n00:09:24.694 --> 00:09:28.370\nAnd that's part of the process that\nallows me to call out to the network and\n\n189\n00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.820\nsay hey,\ngot an operating system out there?\n\n190\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.820\nBecause I need one.\n\n191\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.490\nSo, it's just another place\nthat our buy offs can look\n\n192\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.981\nwhen it needs to bootstrap\nthe operating system.\n\n193\n00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.056\n&gt;&gt; And date and time is very important.\n\n194\n00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:42.090\nHow do we set date and time?\n\n195\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question.\n\n196\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.940\nYes, date and time is very important.\n\n197\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.100\nCuz you have to remember that your\noperating system works on a timer.\n\n198\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.920\nIt works on a heartbeat, a clock, right?\n\n199\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.760\nSo everything has to be synchronized.\n\n200\n00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.450\nAnd system date and time can also be\nmodified here inside of the BIOS.\n\n201\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.600\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n202\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.960\nSo inside of our configurations, that's\nactually under the general location,\n\n203\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.490\nif I kinda scroll back up, you can see\nthat I can set system date and time.\n\n204\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:12.555\nNow, one of the things that I want to\nkeep in mind that runs complementary.\n\n205\n00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:14.937\nAnd you're gonna see that it\nactually kinda comes up in the name,\n\n206\n00:10:14.937 --> 00:10:16.370\ncomplementary to BIOS.\n\n207\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.920\nRemember, I told you BIOS information\nthat is stored in a non volatile chip?\n\n208\n00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.120\nIt basically is\nthe manufacturer's definition of\n\n209\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.640\nhow to get the hardware turned online.\n\n210\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.830\nHowever, sometimes you need to\nmake modifications to that.\n\n211\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.170\nWell, in order to make modifications\nto this BIOS or this non volatile RAM,\n\n212\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.860\nwhat we have to do is that\nflashing process, right?\n\n213\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.590\nAnd if I wanted to come in here and\nchange settings.\n\n214\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.870\nIt wouldn't be feasible to flash the BIOS\nevery time we need to make a minor\n\n215\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.800\nconfiguration.\n\n216\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.640\nSo you have another region\nof volatile memory.\n\n217\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.460\nVery low voltages volatile memory,\n\n218\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.170\nthat actually stores that\ninformation that you can configure.\n\n219\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.770\nThose settings that you can configure and\nthat's something known as CMOS.\n\n220\n00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.460\nThat's the complimentary\nmetal oxide semiconductor.\n\n221\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.670\nAnd again, I know it sounds\nlike a lot of jargon here.\n\n222\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.160\nBut it's just a little\nvolatile memory region\n\n223\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.350\nthat we have a little 3 volt battery\nthat keeps that information refreshed.\n\n224\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.520\nSo that when I come in here and\n\n225\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.310\nI make my changes,\nit will store those user-defined settings.\n\n226\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:22.320\nOne of the tell tale signs that\nthe battery that provides the power\n\n227\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.560\nif you will, to that BIOS is,\nor excuse me.\n\n228\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.710\nProvides the power to the CMOS is\nno longer providing that power,\n\n229\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.670\nis when you come in here,\nmaybe to your BIOS.\n\n230\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.145\nAnd you notice that your system and\ndate and\n\n231\n00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:38.845\ntime keeps refreshing,\nmaybe to a few years earlier.\n\n232\n00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:42.485\nAnd now what's happening here is\nessentially the CMOS is no longer storing\n\n233\n00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:43.815\nyour user defined settings.\n\n234\n00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:46.435\nAnd you have to replace the CMOS battery.\n\n235\n00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:50.405\nSo, system date and\ntime is very, very, important.\n\n236\n00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:53.295\nAnd it is important to make\nsure that it is correct.\n\n237\n00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.205\nAnd one of the tell tale signs that\nyou need to replace that battery on\n\n238\n00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:59.480\nCMOS is when you set the time,\nyou reboot the computer.\n\n239\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.050\nAnd the time is reverted back\nto an earlier date and time.\n\n240\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.610\nAll right, so some other things that we\nmight be able to set inside of your BIOS.\n\n241\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.485\nMaybe, you could set this,\n\n242\n00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:16.035\nsometimes you don't get the chance to,\nis what's known as your clock speeds.\n\n243\n00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:17.495\nAll right, clock speeds.\n\n244\n00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:21.185\nWhen you enter your BIOS setup please\nunderstand that every vendor is different.\n\n245\n00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:26.605\nSome of the gaming boards allow you to set\ndifferent timings on your clock speeds,\n\n246\n00:12:26.605 --> 00:12:28.675\nif you will, or increase the clock speed.\n\n247\n00:12:28.675 --> 00:12:30.875\nAnd it's usually done in a multiplier.\n\n248\n00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:35.210\nNow, they're not gonna ask you to\ncalculate multipliers on the A+ exam.\n\n249\n00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.870\nJust understanding that what it does and\n\n250\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.810\nyou could also hear it called\nthe front-side bus multiplier.\n\n251\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.750\nIt allows you to increase the clock speed,\nall right.\n\n252\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.570\nImagine being able to hit the gas\non the engine, what does it do?\n\n253\n00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:46.550\nIt revs the engine up.\n\n254\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.890\nIt makes the engine in a car go faster.\n\n255\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.720\nWell, that's essentially what\nincreasing the clock speed does.\n\n256\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.900\nBut I warn you, be careful on this,\nbecause when you increase the clock speed,\n\n257\n00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.160\nessentially what you're doing is\nyou're applying more voltage to it.\n\n258\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.120\nWhen you're applying more voltage to\na CPU, you run the risk of causing\n\n259\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.180\nother components to fail, or\ncausing damage to the motherboard.\n\n260\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.086\nJust because, again,\nyou're increasing the voltage to the CPU.\n\n261\n00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:16.345\nOne of the things that you wanna do is,\nif you do increase the clock speed,\n\n262\n00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:18.350\nyou have to check the CPU voltage.\n\n263\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.240\nAnd I said CPU, let's go ahead and\ndefine that acronym too.\n\n264\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.190\nSo I get so used to saying these acronyms.\n\n265\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.110\nThat's the the central processing unit,\nright.\n\n266\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.200\nThat's the brains of the operation that\nis calculating all the information.\n\n267\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.686\n&gt;&gt; I can try on the big head.\n\n268\n00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:32.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n269\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.420\nAnd what we can do, is we can increase\nthe computational power of the machine\n\n270\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.210\nby hitting it with some more voltage.\n\n271\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.620\nBut, again make sure that\nthe CPU voltage is set\n\n272\n00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.080\nto match whatever the clock\nspeed is if you do increase it.\n\n273\n00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.010\nAgain, the other thing too is when\nyou increase the clock speed,\n\n274\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.160\nyou're increasing the voltage.\n\n275\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.000\nSo you have to make sure that\nyou have enough voltage to\n\n276\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.190\nmatch whatever you're going to\nincrease the clock speed on.\n\n277\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:06.270\nSometimes, it is something that you can\ndo, sometimes you can't set them at all.\n\n278\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.230\nI know some of the gaming boards,\nwhere gamers like to squeeze\n\n279\n00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.320\nevery bit of performance out of\ntheir machine that they can.\n\n280\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.719\nSpend a lot of money doing that.\n\n281\n00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:21.050\nWe'll do this, but in some of the basic\nsystems like this system that I have here,\n\n282\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.560\nyou can't increase the clock speed.\n\n283\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.510\nThere's minor variations that you can do.\n\n284\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:29.190\nBut this is a vendor specific technology\nlike for instance, rapid speed and\n\n285\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:35.290\nstuff technologies, but\nagain just check with your manufacturer.\n\n286\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.010\nNow let's go ahead and\n\n287\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.820\nlook at some of the other settings\nthat we can see inside a BIOS.\n\n288\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.536\nAnd again, I'm giving you an example\nof one here that is specific\n\n289\n00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:46.123\nto an Optiplex 960, I believe.\n\n290\n00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:47.127\nIt's a Dell Optiplex.\n\n291\n00:14:47.127 --> 00:14:50.800\nSo, what you have in your system\nmight differ a little bit.\n\n292\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.640\nBut for the most part,\n\n293\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:57.170\nyou're gonna see a lot of the same things\nthat you'll see inside of this BIOS.\n\n294\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.990\nAll right, for instance, old serial ports,\nthe com ports, communication ports.\n\n295\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.580\nA lot of times we don't even use these\ntoday cuz this goes back to the old\n\n296\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.460\nserial based interfaces.\n\n297\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.664\nLargely been replaced today by\nthe universal serial bus, USB and\n\n298\n00:15:10.664 --> 00:15:12.810\nthings like FireWire and stuff.\n\n299\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.370\nSo you can set these,\n\n300\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:19.770\nbut keep in mind, these are really\nbecoming more of an outdated technology.\n\n301\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.010\nWe can do things like our\nserial ATA operations.\n\n302\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.990\nAgain, doing things like the advanced\nhost configuration interface,\n\n303\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.950\nwhich we'll talk a little bit\nmore in our storage section.\n\n304\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.890\nSo don't let that confuse you right now.\n\n305\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.280\nWe will come back to it.\n\n306\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.370\nAnd we can set it back to a legacy\nmode too, like the ATA modes and\n\n307\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.810\nthat goes back to the advance\ntechnology attachments.\n\n308\n00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.166\nAnd again don't let those\nacronyms worry you right now.\n\n309\n00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:46.342\nBecause when we get into our storage\nsection, where we define source\n\n310\n00:15:46.342 --> 00:15:51.319\ntechnologies, I'll definitely make sure\nthat we bring you up to speed on those.\n\n311\n00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:55.457\nNow the hard drives, that's another thing\nin the BIOS information that we can see.\n\n312\n00:15:55.457 --> 00:15:57.797\nBut we can also do some\nconfigurations here.\n\n313\n00:15:57.797 --> 00:16:01.383\nAnd this goes back to the CMOS\nthat we were talking about,\n\n314\n00:16:01.383 --> 00:16:05.520\nwhen we talk about\nComplementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor.\n\n315\n00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.155\nBoy, they can't say that ten times fast.\n\n316\n00:16:07.155 --> 00:16:09.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that when I get a system,\n\n317\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.520\nwhen a system is brought in,\nlet's say I bought it from the vendor.\n\n318\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.810\nIt might have a single hard drive in it,\nit might not have four hard drives.\n\n319\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.310\nWhich you can see this one does have\nfour hard drives, you can see SATA0,\n\n320\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.880\nSATA One sata two sata three.\n\n321\n00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.690\nThat's essentially four\ndifferent hard drives but\n\n322\n00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.050\nyou might get a system when the\nconfiguration comes from the manufacturer\n\n323\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.790\nthat only has a single hard drive.\n\n324\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.071\nSo what happens we end up,\n\n325\n00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:33.825\noops what happens is I\napparently hit the wrong button.\n\n326\n00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:36.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can see that I can actually turn\n\n327\n00:16:36.318 --> 00:16:40.665\nthese interfaces off and I'm not gonna go\nahead and turn these off but I could, but\n\n328\n00:16:40.665 --> 00:16:42.480\nI can also turn them on.\n\n329\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.670\nNow, understand, when I got this system\nfrom the vendor, maybe it had one hard\n\n330\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.470\ndrive in it, and all three of the other\ninterfaces were turned off, all right?\n\n331\n00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.180\nWell, when I put in and\ninstall another hard drive, and\n\n332\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.440\nI turn that interface on,\nwhere are those settings going to be?\n\n333\n00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.490\nThose settings are gonna\nbe stored in CMOS, right?\n\n334\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.840\n&gt;&gt; Because what comes from\nthe manufacturer by itself,\n\n335\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.260\nis stored in basic input output system,\nor UEFI.\n\n336\n00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.590\nNow there's some other things\nthat we can do in here too.\n\n337\n00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:13.420\nIf we doing things, like for instance,\nkeeping an eye on our hard drives.\n\n338\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.410\nLet me see if I can get out of here.\n\n339\n00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.260\nThere we go.\n\n340\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.550\nYou can see things like smart operations,\n\n341\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.460\nwhich we'll talk about in\nanother episode as well.\n\n342\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.450\nJust basically being able to-\n&gt;&gt; Monitor your hard drives for\n\n343\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.940\nany kind of errors that\nmight be happening.\n\n344\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.380\nYou could see USB configuration, right.\n\n345\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.920\nNow USB configuration, this can vary.\n\n346\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.250\nCuz again we have some older technology,\nnewer technology here.\n\n347\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.170\nWe have 2.0, which is an earlier standard,\nand 3.0 that this supports.\n\n348\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:46.000\nAgain you can see things like for\ninstance rear, and right, and\n\n349\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.180\n&gt;&gt; And left and dual.\n\n350\n00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.750\nSo we can configure which\none of those interfaces,\n\n351\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.090\nthose USB ports that you would plug\na drive into, would be on or turned off.\n\n352\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.620\nWe can also do things like configuring\nthe audio settings as well, all right?\n\n353\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.440\nThis disables or enables,\nas you can see on the screen,\n\n354\n00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.549\nthe integrated audio controller, right?\n\n355\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.600\nNow, Integrations.\n\n356\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.420\nLet´s talk just a second about\nthat when it comes to our bios.\n\n357\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.460\nIntegration means that it is built into\nthe functionality of the motherboard.\n\n358\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.589\nIt means all the little chips that we\ntalk about in our motherboard episode,\n\n359\n00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:21.729\nthey understand how to control audio.\n\n360\n00:18:21.729 --> 00:18:26.872\nCan you get a better sound if you\nhave a non integrated audio board?\n\n361\n00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:27.840\nYes, you can.\n\n362\n00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.378\nWe put in expansion cards and\nwe get expanded functionality.\n\n363\n00:18:30.378 --> 00:18:35.190\nHowever, if we are gonna go that route,\nwe can't have two audio systems trying to\n\n364\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.070\ncontrol the operating\nsystem's audio system.\n\n365\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.022\nThey don't play nice together.\n\n366\n00:18:39.022 --> 00:18:40.562\nSo, I'd have to turn one off.\n\n367\n00:18:40.562 --> 00:18:43.460\nIn this case,\nI would turn off the integrated audio.\n\n368\n00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.620\nHowever, if I don't have an expansion\ncard and I just don't have the money or\n\n369\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.796\nwhatever, don't have the resources,\n\n370\n00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:54.920\nit's nice to have that functionality built\ninto the capabilities of the motherboard.\n\n371\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.350\nAnd what Bio-Ops is gonna do when it\nis enabled it is gonna wake up and\n\n372\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.820\nit is gonna stabilize\nthe audio sub system.\n\n373\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:06.590\nAgain, send some components a few signals\nout and say hey audio Are you out there?\n\n374\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.610\nRemember, input output system.\n\n375\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.520\nAnd then it's gonna get some output\nback that the audio says yes, I'm here,\n\n376\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.400\nI'm good, I'm stabilized, I'm ready to go.\n\n377\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.450\nNow, you can also see some\nother devices here too like\n\n378\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.540\nthey talk about miscellaneous devices.\n\n379\n00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.470\nThis is a PCI slot, that's\nthe Peripheral Component Interconnect.\n\n380\n00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.320\nNow, And we talk about that as well\nin our expansion card section too.\n\n381\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.160\nSo this is telling me,\ndo I wanna have the PCI?\n\n382\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.690\nDo I wanna have PCI on or off?\n\n383\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.430\nRight?\n\n384\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.200\nAnd in this case we got it turned it on.\n\n385\n00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.080\nNow we can go through some other things\nhere in BIOS too because one of the things\n\n386\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.100\nthat the BIOS does is it sends out\na little signal to the video [INAUDIBLE]\n\n387\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.800\nsystem if it is integrated.\n\n388\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.790\nIf it´s integrated then the video\nsubsystem will call back to bios and say,\n\n389\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.810\nhey, I´m here, I´m stabalized,\nI´m good, we´re ready to go.\n\n390\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.612\nGo on with your input output system,\ncheck the next device.\n\n391\n00:19:58.612 --> 00:20:02.239\nHowever, if you have an audio\ncard in an expansion slot,\n\n392\n00:20:02.239 --> 00:20:06.490\na slot on the motherboard,\ngives you better functionality.\n\n393\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.400\nA lot of times those video cards have\ntheir own vies built right into the card\n\n394\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.970\nand then what the master vies in this case\nwhat we're looking at here does says okay\n\n395\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.350\nI'm not going to take control of that.\n\n396\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.500\nYou go ahead video card you just let\nme know that you're ready to go and\n\n397\n00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.480\nthat it sends back.\n\n398\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.210\nIt still communicates\nwith the master vies but\n\n399\n00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.630\nit has the hardware on it\nthat it can stabilize itself.\n\n400\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.117\nNow just like out audio.\n\n401\n00:20:31.117 --> 00:20:36.120\nWe have to understand that if\nwe have an onboard video system,\n\n402\n00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.760\nwe have to have one turned on and\none turned off.\n\n403\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.690\nAll right, you don't need it turned\noff if you don't have a graphics card\n\n404\n00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.990\nsitting in that expansion slot.\n\n405\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.440\nIf you do have that graphics card sitting\nin that expansion slot then you're gonna\n\n406\n00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.770\nhave to make sure that you turn this\noff so the BIOS doesn't look to and\n\n407\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.040\ncall on That system as a part\nof its routine, all right.\n\n408\n00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.910\nSo those are a couple of things\nthat we can do inside of our BIOS.\n\n409\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.950\nBut we've got some more things that\nwe're gonna look at coming up.\n\n410\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.180\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I understand security\nwould be important in the BIOS.\n\n411\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.910\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is, and some of the\nthings that we need to keep in mind is,\n\n412\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:19.130\nfor instance, we can tell sometimes when\npeople actually get into the system.\n\n413\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.220\nWhich is kind of cool.\n\n414\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.820\nI will tell you as you're going on in your\nsecurity training, remember if somebody's\n\n415\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.300\ngot physical access to your device,\nsecurity really needs to be beefed up.\n\n416\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.570\nBut at least they give us a way to\nsee certain types of things and\n\n417\n00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.760\nalso to secure different\nthings inside of the BIOS.\n\n418\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.970\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n419\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.460\nYou'll see in this one we do\nhave some security setting here.\n\n420\n00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.970\nIf I go ahead and\nwhat I do is I expand them out,\n\n421\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.170\nwe got quite a few things that we can do.\n\n422\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.250\nWe can for instance,\nwe can set it to administrative password.\n\n423\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.520\nNow an administrative\npassword is interesting,\n\n424\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.180\nnow cuz what an administrative\npassword does is it\n\n425\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.660\nessentially allows people\nthe ability to configure the bios.\n\n426\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.160\nBut you can also have, for\ninstance, a system password.\n\n427\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.803\nAnd again the system password means that\nyou're allowed to not only boot bios, but\n\n428\n00:22:05.803 --> 00:22:08.668\nyou're allowed to now boot\nthe operating system.\n\n429\n00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:13.967\nNow guys and gals out there, don't confuse\nthis with an operating system password,\n\n430\n00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:16.544\nafter we booted everything the operating\n\n431\n00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:21.810\nsystem is showing you a log-on screen\nThat is a separate password altogether.\n\n432\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:22.991\nWhat this really says is,\n\n433\n00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:26.600\nare you even allowed to get to the point\nwhere you can boot the operating system?\n\n434\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.930\nSo a couple of good things, right.\n\n435\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.868\nSo if you said a system password, right.\n\n436\n00:22:30.868 --> 00:22:34.798\nWhat that does, it gives you the ability\nto just continue the booting process.\n\n437\n00:22:34.798 --> 00:22:37.563\nBut it doesn't allow you\nactually get in here and\n\n438\n00:22:37.563 --> 00:22:40.840\nconfigure the settings that\nyou see in front of you.\n\n439\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.890\nThe administrative password, what it\nallows somebody to do is get in and\n\n440\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.650\nmake changes to the BIOS.\n\n441\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.050\nNow we can go in a little bit\nfurther Farther than that, for\n\n442\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:53.700\ninstance if the device has\nthings like drive encryption\n\n443\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.220\nyou can require drive encryption in your\nBIOS as well which will do a hard drive\n\n444\n00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.090\nencryption just like it sounds.\n\n445\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.180\nBasically scrambling your data so\n\n446\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.320\nthat if it is taken out of this device and\nmaybe put into another device you won't\n\n447\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.190\nbe able to read the data We can do other\nthings too, you'll see in fact in here\n\n448\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:17.370\nthere is something known as TPM security\nand we can turn that on or off all right.\n\n449\n00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.733\nNow what is the TPM, the TPM essentially\nis something known as a trusted platform\n\n450\n00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:25.905\nmodule All right now that sounds like it\nis a highly technical type technology\n\n451\n00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:29.947\nthere but really all it is is it's\na little chip that sits in the motherboard\n\n452\n00:23:29.947 --> 00:23:32.032\nand it stores security information.\n\n453\n00:23:32.032 --> 00:23:38.155\nAnd it also works with another technology\nthat we have called Secure Boot.\n\n454\n00:23:38.155 --> 00:23:43.316\nNow, Secure Boot is part of the Unified\nExtensible Firmware Interface Platform,\n\n455\n00:23:43.316 --> 00:23:44.800\nit is not a part of BIOS.\n\n456\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.524\nThis is one of the advantages of\nmoving to the modern UEFI system.\n\n457\n00:23:48.524 --> 00:23:52.374\nSecure Boot, what this does is\nthis says If we don't have trusted\n\n458\n00:23:52.374 --> 00:23:55.594\nbootloaders stored in that\ntrusted platform module,\n\n459\n00:23:55.594 --> 00:23:59.654\nremember I told you it stores\nsecurity configuration information,\n\n460\n00:23:59.654 --> 00:24:04.670\nthen it won't allow the operating\nsystem to even bootstrap itself.\n\n461\n00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.140\nSo very good thing to have.\n\n462\n00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.020\nSecure Boot is something that will\nlock down your system if, lets say for\n\n463\n00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.490\ninstance, a boot loader virus tries\nto bootstrap the operating system and\n\n464\n00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.950\ninject a root kit.\n\n465\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.040\nWhat Secure Boot says is, hey, I see\nsomething trying to take over the hardware\n\n466\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.730\nhere, which is what an operating\nsystem does, but what I'm not seeing\n\n467\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.040\nis that information that identifies it as\ntrusted down in that little processor,\n\n468\n00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.030\nthat little TPM,\nthat Trusted Platform Module.\n\n469\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.820\nNow, the level of what you can\nconfigure here is really based\n\n470\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.920\non the vendor themselves.\n\n471\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.850\nNow the other thing that we have\nis something known as LoJack.\n\n472\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.120\n&gt;&gt; So are we talking about tracking\nyour car if your car gets stolen here.\n\n473\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.830\n&gt;&gt; You know that's interesting Zack that\nyou say that cuz the technology is really\n\n474\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.095\nthe same, right?\n\n475\n00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:53.320\nLoJack it was, in fact,\nif we can bring back up the screen,\n\n476\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.390\nits interesting cuz this\none still has Computrace.\n\n477\n00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.900\nNow on the exam, ladies and gentlemen\nout there, they call that LoJack.\n\n478\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.970\nThis was the earlier name of Computrace,\nthey changed it to LoJack, but\n\n479\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.840\nall it means is it's a way\nof tracing your computer.\n\n480\n00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.950\nAnd I'll give you a little story here.\n\n481\n00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:15.010\nSeveral years back, there was a guy that\ndid some social engineering attack and\n\n482\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.100\nhe went into a company dressed in like a,\n\n483\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:23.340\nI don't know what you call them,\nthe suits or whatever, like a jumpsuit.\n\n484\n00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.880\nAnd he looked like he was a technician.\n\n485\n00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.670\nAnd he said, hey, I'm a technician\nhere and I'm here to work on such and\n\n486\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.830\nsuch machine.\n\n487\n00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.000\nWell, what they didn't notice\nis the cart that he brought in,\n\n488\n00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.130\nhe was actually stealing people's laptops\nand he was putting them on the cart, and\n\n489\n00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.490\nhe walked right out of the building\nwith a whole bunch of laptops.\n\n490\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.020\nWell, he stole the wrong laptop\nbecause one of these had Computrace or\n\n491\n00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.815\nLoJack on it and the authorities were\nable to track it down to its location.\n\n492\n00:25:45.815 --> 00:25:48.495\nSo it's a very, very good thing to have.\n\n493\n00:25:48.495 --> 00:25:51.965\nAnd if you do have it within your system,\nespecially things like laptops,\n\n494\n00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:54.515\nI would definitely\nrecommend turning it on.\n\n495\n00:25:54.515 --> 00:25:58.815\nCuz it's is a way that if your device does\ngets stolen, kinda like you said with\n\n496\n00:25:58.815 --> 00:26:03.790\nthe cars and stuff, that you can,\nhopefully, you can bring it back\n\n497\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.820\nin your possession or, if nothing else,\nyou can do what´s known as a remote wipe.\n\n498\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.670\nAny data that´s on the system from\na remote location, you can essentially\n\n499\n00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.050\nissue a command that says, all the data\nthat´s on the hard drive, eradicate it.\n\n500\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.230\nJust erase it completely.\n\n501\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:25.040\nSo a nice thing to have when it comes to\nyour security and securing your systems.\n\n502\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.820\nNow, I also mentioned some of\nthe things that you can do, too,\n\n503\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.670\nis things like chassis intrusion or\nintrusion detection.\n\n504\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.600\nAnd this just basically means that\nif the case is opened up, and\n\n505\n00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.390\nthat means somebody's gonna try to get in\nand gain physical access to the machine,\n\n506\n00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.760\nonce they close it, next time you boot\nthe machine, it's gonna let you know,\n\n507\n00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.780\nBIOS is gonna do what it does.\n\n508\n00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.320\nYou'll see, when BIOS boots up,\na lot of times,\n\n509\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.030\nwhat you see is a little bit\nof load diagnostic tests.\n\n510\n00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.730\nThat's actually the first part of BIOS.\n\n511\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.960\nBIOS has what's known as\na power on self test.\n\n512\n00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.480\nAnd the power on self test, basically,\nis what's sending out a little electrical\n\n513\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.890\nsignal saying, hey, if I send power\nto you, can you report back to me?\n\n514\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.726\nOnce you report back to me, I know that\nyou're present, and then BIOS starts to,\n\n515\n00:27:09.726 --> 00:27:12.100\nbasically, turn on all the hardware.\n\n516\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.480\nWell, as part of that post process,\nif the chassis has been opened,\n\n517\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.160\nthe tower, the case of the machine,\nyou're gonna be made aware of it,\n\n518\n00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.000\nit's gonna be a little low level text,\n\n519\n00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.150\nthat low resolution text that comes across\nthe screen that says intrusion detected.\n\n520\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.910\nSo that's a great thing to know if anybody\nhas tried to make some physical access.\n\n521\n00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.720\nNow keep in mind, it doesn't stop them,\nif they do make access\n\n522\n00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.750\ninto the device itself, but\nit at least will make you aware of it.\n\n523\n00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.220\nSo whether that's there or not,\n\n524\n00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.280\nagain, I will tell you,\nis really contingent on your device.\n\n525\n00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.240\n&gt;&gt; What's virtualization support?\n\n526\n00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:47.760\nWhat is that?\n\n527\n00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.870\n&gt;&gt; Virtualization, now that's another\nthing that's really, really handy today,\n\n528\n00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.700\nand it's another thing\nthat has become very,\n\n529\n00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:59.198\nvery popular inside of our PCs, and\nnot only PCs, but Macs if you will.\n\n530\n00:27:59.198 --> 00:28:04.205\nAnd virtualization software's where\nyou can essentially run more than one\n\n531\n00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:11.095\noperating system within a single CPU,\nwithin a single PC or system unit.\n\n532\n00:28:11.095 --> 00:28:15.100\nIn the earlier days, if we wanted to have\nmore than one operating system, then what\n\n533\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.630\nwe would do is we would do something\nknown as a dual boot or a multi-boot.\n\n534\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.690\nNow understand that when\nyou do a multi-boot,\n\n535\n00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:25.000\nyou have one operating system boots up,\nit takes control of the hardware, and\n\n536\n00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.600\nwe work with that operating system.\n\n537\n00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.770\nNow to get into the second operating\nsystem in a multi-boot situation,\n\n538\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.880\nwe have to shut the first\noperating system down and\n\n539\n00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.090\nwe have to launch the second\noperating system.\n\n540\n00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.870\nWhen you talk about virtualization, if\nyour CPU supports it, that means that we\n\n541\n00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:44.470\ncan run more than one instance of\nan operating system simultaneously on\n\n542\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.680\na single physical device, which is really\ngreat for things like testing purposes.\n\n543\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.000\nBut you have to make sure\nthat your BIOS supports it.\n\n544\n00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.210\nMost of the modern systems\ndo support your BIOS.\n\n545\n00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.650\nIn fact, Intel has their Intel VT, and\n\n546\n00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:04.970\nthen AMD based systems have AMDV,\nwhich is AMD virtualization.\n\n547\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.810\nLet me show you here,\ncuz sometimes you have to enable it.\n\n548\n00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.720\nSometimes, in fact, let me go ahead and\nI'll close some of these off here,\n\n549\n00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.980\nmake it a little bit\neasier to move around.\n\n550\n00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.830\nYou can see that this one does\nhave a virtualization option.\n\n551\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.680\nIt says virtualization support.\n\n552\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.990\nAnd when we get into here,\n\n553\n00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.520\nnotice this is an Intel based system,\ncuz you can see the VT.\n\n554\n00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.480\nSo it's Intel VT, if you will.\n\n555\n00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.680\nBut notice that virtualization\nis turned on, right?\n\n556\n00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.320\nAnd you can see virtualization technology.\n\n557\n00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.030\nAnd again, AMD has their flavor of it,\nit's AMD V.\n\n558\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:38.960\nAgain, sometimes you have to enable it,\nsometimes you have to disable it.\n\n559\n00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.830\nBut make sure that if you're going to try\nto implement some kind of virtualization\n\n560\n00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:48.360\nwhere you want to run more than one\noperating system on a single device,\n\n561\n00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.930\nmake sure that you check whether that\nvirtualization is turned on or not.\n\n562\n00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:56.480\nAll right, so some of the other\nthings that we might be able to do.\n\n563\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.690\nI mentioned smart, all right,\nsmart is a technology.\n\n564\n00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:03.030\nAgain, we'll talk about it a little bit\nmore in our hard drive technologies that\n\n565\n00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.100\nallows you to do things like diagnostics.\n\n566\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.940\nSometimes, there are built-in diagnostics.\n\n567\n00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.980\nSometimes there're not, all right?\n\n568\n00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.780\nSo if we look at our system here,\n\n569\n00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.780\nwe can see that there are some\nmaintenance things that we can do.\n\n570\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.142\nSo for instance, service tags,\nand, where is system logs here?\n\n571\n00:30:22.795 --> 00:30:24.565\nPower Management, all right.\n\n572\n00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:29.925\nSo sometimes you have system diagnostics,\nsometimes you don't.\n\n573\n00:30:29.925 --> 00:30:34.435\nThe example of one, again, is like\nthat smart technology that you have.\n\n574\n00:30:34.435 --> 00:30:39.225\nPower Management as well, and\nI'm not really seeing any, in this one,\n\n575\n00:30:39.225 --> 00:30:43.615\nany specific, there, no, I'm not really\nseeing any system diagnostics that we can\n\n576\n00:30:43.615 --> 00:30:47.100\ndo here, but we can log different\ntypes of events as well.\n\n577\n00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.840\nThe level of diagnostics that you can do\nis really contingent again on the BIOS\n\n578\n00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.370\nthat you have.\n\n579\n00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.650\nFor instance, in some of the systems that\nyou have, you could monitor things like\n\n580\n00:30:54.650 --> 00:31:00.390\nfan speed, again intrusion detection\nwe've talked about, with notifications.\n\n581\n00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.770\nYou can monitor the voltage.\n\n582\n00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:08.790\nI said if you're going to increase\nthe CPU clock speed, well, you need to\n\n583\n00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.630\nmonitor the voltage cuz that's what you're\ndoing, you're ramping up the voltage that\n\n584\n00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.310\nyou're sending into the CPU to make\nthat engine run a little bit faster.\n\n585\n00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.480\nSo sometimes you can monitor this as well.\n\n586\n00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.700\nA lot of times you can monitor the bus\nspeed and see where the bus speed is at.\n\n587\n00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.450\nYou could also have things like third\nparty software that can do this too.\n\n588\n00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.120\nBut what's interesting is in some\nof these systems you can also do\n\n589\n00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.190\nthermal temperature monitoring too.\n\n590\n00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.370\nFor instance, these 960s here.\n\n591\n00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.899\nAnd I know the earlier 940s I believe they\nwere, and 745s, would have things like\n\n592\n00:31:38.899 --> 00:31:43.062\nlittle thermal temperature sensors and\nthey would plug into the motherboard and\n\n593\n00:31:43.062 --> 00:31:46.076\nthey would snake their way\naround to the front of the case.\n\n594\n00:31:46.076 --> 00:31:49.263\nAnd what they would do is they would\nmonitor the overall temperature of\n\n595\n00:31:49.263 --> 00:31:52.082\nthe system Making sure that\nit's within the adequate means.\n\n596\n00:31:52.082 --> 00:31:56.204\nBecause remember two of\nthe major things components,\n\n597\n00:31:56.204 --> 00:32:00.325\nwell one of the major components or\ncauses if you will,\n\n598\n00:32:00.325 --> 00:32:04.550\nof component failure is\nimproper thermal management.\n\n599\n00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.260\nBasically, overheating, so\n\n600\n00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.460\nit is important that we do make\nsure that we're monitoring that.\n\n601\n00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.180\nSometimes you have that built\nin the case where the actual\n\n602\n00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.300\ntower can do this as well.\n\n603\n00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.424\nSometimes you can see that we have this\nagain built into the by laws that it will\n\n604\n00:32:19.424 --> 00:32:22.481\nshow you what the current core\ntemperature is of the CPU.\n\n605\n00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:25.102\nWhat the core temperature not\nthe core temperature, but\n\n606\n00:32:25.102 --> 00:32:27.800\nwhat the temperature of\nthe system unit is as well.\n\n607\n00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.840\nCuz keep in mind, as our CPU's heat up,\n\n608\n00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.010\nright, the hotter they get, the more\nlikely they are to become damaged.\n\n609\n00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.830\nAnd really when it comes\nto thermal damage,\n\n610\n00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.040\na lot of times you don't actually see it.\n\n611\n00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.646\nIt usually manifest itself in\nkinda erratic behavior and\n\n612\n00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:46.533\nit can be very hard to detect.\n\n613\n00:32:46.533 --> 00:32:51.500\nSo that's why it's good to have some\nkind of temperature monitoring system.\n\n614\n00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.760\nNow, if you don't have that in your BIOS,\ndon't worry about that,\n\n615\n00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.340\nbecause you do have software that you can\nget and you can install on your machine\n\n616\n00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.340\nthat can do this from inside\nof the operating system, too.\n\n617\n00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.264\nNow the other thing is, fans.\n\n618\n00:33:03.264 --> 00:33:11.086\nYou have things like CPU fans that help to\nactively cool the CPU if you are plugging,\n\n619\n00:33:11.086 --> 00:33:15.240\nwell CPU fans they plug\nto the mother board.\n\n620\n00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.220\nBut sometimes, you have system fans as\nwell, that plug into the mother board.\n\n621\n00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.730\nAnd one of the things that\nyou can do with monitoring,\n\n622\n00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.510\nis you can actually monitor what\nthe fan speed is, how many RPMs it is.\n\n623\n00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.189\nSo for instance if you increase\nthe voltage to the CPU, and\n\n624\n00:33:27.189 --> 00:33:28.946\nyou increase the power to the system.\n\n625\n00:33:28.946 --> 00:33:33.270\nA lot of times what you'll have is fans\nthat are controlled by the mother board.\n\n626\n00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.132\nAnd they're variable speed fans and\n\n627\n00:33:35.132 --> 00:33:38.983\nthey'll put more electrical current\ngoing into the fan to speed up the RPM.\n\n628\n00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:43.073\nAnd that's why it's good in these\nwhen you have monitoring like this,\n\n629\n00:33:43.073 --> 00:33:47.366\nbecause you can see as the fans ramp\nup is it bringing down the temperature,\n\n630\n00:33:47.366 --> 00:33:49.772\nthe internal temperature of the system.\n\n631\n00:33:49.772 --> 00:33:54.237\nYou might find that it's ramping\nthe system fans up to a high RPM and\n\n632\n00:33:54.237 --> 00:33:59.770\nyou're not noticing anything going down\nin the temperature of the machine.\n\n633\n00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.580\nThat could be a telltale sign that\neither your fan's failing or it\n\n634\n00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.510\ncould just be that the fan's not adequate\nfor the system and that does happen.\n\n635\n00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.284\nAnd that's why I mentioned\nearlier Zach that a caution,\n\n636\n00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:14.924\nwhen you're increasing the CPU\nvoltage like that sometimes you might\n\n637\n00:34:14.924 --> 00:34:17.613\nhear that called overclocking as well.\n\n638\n00:34:17.613 --> 00:34:19.693\nYes, you could get a better performance,\nbut\n\n639\n00:34:19.693 --> 00:34:23.230\nyou have to know that there are checks and\nbalances that you have to implement.\n\n640\n00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.460\nIf I increase voltage I increase power.\n\n641\n00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.620\nIf I increase both of those\nI increase temperature.\n\n642\n00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.680\nSo I might have to increase the cooling\nunit that we have inside of the system.\n\n643\n00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.020\nAnd we'll talk about cooling\nunits in another episode.\n\n644\n00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.560\nBut however,\nknow what the basic output system is.\n\n645\n00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.270\nKnow that we go through things\nlike the power on self test,\n\n646\n00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.860\nright, post as it's called.\n\n647\n00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.860\nSend out a little electrical signals,\nwe check on those devices,\n\n648\n00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.160\nmake sure that they are present.\n\n649\n00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.352\nBIOS helps us to finish the process\nby stabilizing all of those devices.\n\n650\n00:34:50.352 --> 00:34:52.294\nAnd then, finally looking for\n\n651\n00:34:52.294 --> 00:34:56.230\na master boot record to\nbootstrap the operating system.\n\n652\n00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:59.998\nAllow the operating system to take\nover and in the end it's your hardware\n\n653\n00:34:59.998 --> 00:35:03.768\nmanufacturers that have to worry about\nthe basic input output system and\n\n654\n00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.709\nnot your operating system vendors.\n\n655\n00:35:05.709 --> 00:35:11.420\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as usual Wes,\nconfigure BIOS and UEFI settings.\n\n656\n00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.308\nMarvelously done and 8 plus 901.\n\n657\n00:35:13.308 --> 00:35:15.310\nThere is more in this series.\n\n658\n00:35:16.682 --> 00:35:20.860\nIn ITProTV, we are committed to\nhelping you learn where ever you go.\n\n659\n00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.720\nAnd a good ITPro is always learning.\n\n660\n00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.570\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n661\n00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:25.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n662\n00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:30.294\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n663\n00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:33.744\n[MUSIC]\n\n664\n00:35:33.744 --> 00:35:36.750\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

watching ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.810\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CompTIA A+ 901.\n\n5\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.160\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.970\nwe're going to be taking in a look at\nmotherboards and their components.\n\n7\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.980\nAnd here to explain all those\nintricate little parts and\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.190\nwhat the heck they do and\nwhy we care, is Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.280\nWelcome, Wes.\n&gt;&gt; Hely, thanks for having me here, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.710\nPleasure to be here with ITPro.Tv.\n\n11\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.510\nThat is right, we are going to be looking\nat, well, a bunch of goodies today.\n\n12\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.060\nWe're going to be looking\nat a lot of hardware,\n\n13\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.380\nwe're going to be trying to let you\nknow a little bit about that hardware.\n\n14\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.790\nAnd we're gonna dive into some things\nthat you need to know for the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.420\nSometimes maybe not the fun stuff but\nstandardization and specification.\n\n16\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.980\nSo, that is what we are gonna\nlook at here in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.045\nOne of the first things I'd like\nto talk about is a motherboard.\n\n18\n00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:56.130\nYou heard Mike mentioned it,\nwhat is a motherboard?\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.990\nWhy do we even need it?\n\n20\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.620\nWell, a motherboard,\nif you think about it,\n\n21\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.170\nif you looking at your computer right now,\nyou probably see this little box, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.500\nWell, if we take that box apart,\nwe got a lot of components.\n\n23\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.020\nThe box itself is kind of\nlike an exoskeleton, and\n\n24\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.580\nwe've got a lot of components in there,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.590\nAnd we're gonna talk about all of these\ncomponents in other episodes as we proceed\n\n26\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.110\nthrough this series here.\n\n27\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.590\nBut let's just kind of run down it, right?\n\n28\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.040\nWe've got a power supply, right?\n\n29\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.510\nWe've got a central processing unit that\nis like the brains of the operation.\n\n30\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.010\nWe got some hard drives for\ndata storage in there.\n\n31\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.700\nWe've got random access memory or\nsystem memory, right?\n\n32\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.450\nA temporary storage unit for\nour data so that we can work with it.\n\n33\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.420\nWell, what is it that\nties everything together?\n\n34\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.730\nWell, that's the motherboard.\n\n35\n00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.980\nThe motherboard is a circuit board\nthat essentially is like the backbone\n\n36\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.440\nof the entire system unit.\n\n37\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.505\nAnd it's important to understand\nwhat that component is doing for us.\n\n38\n00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:45.305\nWhat it looks like and then some\nof the pieces that you could find\n\n39\n00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.065\nwith the components within\nthe motherboard themselves.\n\n40\n00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:48.895\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\nSo\n\n41\n00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:51.085\nall computers that have\na motherboard inside them?\n\n42\n00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:54.825\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and it's one of\nthe components, doesn't matter how big or\n\n43\n00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:59.315\nhow small the computing system is,\nmost of them will\n\n44\n00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:03.555\nhave some type of printed circuit board\nthat ties these components together.\n\n45\n00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:06.810\nNow, they could be different sizes,\nthey could be different shapes,\n\n46\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930\nthey could have different arrangements,\nbut for\n\n47\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.700\nthe most part, like you said, we're gonna\nfind those in just about any system.\n\n48\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.350\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about the motherboard itself.\n\n49\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.498\nAnd in fact, I've got one here.\n\n50\n00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:20.680\nWe kinda actually got a few of them here\nand if we could take a look at them,\n\n51\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.720\nyou're gonna see that these motherboards\nhave a lot of different components.\n\n52\n00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.845\nNow, I wanna just talk briefly\nabout these components here.\n\n53\n00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:30.720\nYou'll notice that there are some\ncomponents that are built\n\n54\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.470\ninto the motherboard.\n\n55\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.570\nIf I was to turn this motherboard over,\nyou can see some of these components\n\n56\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.790\nare soldered directly into\nthe motherboard themselves.\n\n57\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.600\nThat's what's known as\nan integrated component.\n\n58\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.820\nAnd we kinda understand that integrated\ncomponents aren't something that we\n\n59\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.910\ncan really change if something fails,\nright.\n\n60\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.660\nThe benefit of the integrated\ncomponents is sometimes it can\n\n61\n00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.590\nexpand the functionality of\nthe motherboard without having to buy like\n\n62\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.560\nthird party accessories to\ngive you that functionality.\n\n63\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.760\nNow we also have, as you can see here,\nwe've got some different slots and\n\n64\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.590\nsockets here.\n\n65\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.768\nNow, these are for what are known\nas non-integrated components.\n\n66\n00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:05.760\nAnd the non-integrated components\nare things that can expand\n\n67\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.580\nthe functionality of the system.\n\n68\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.802\nAnd one of the great things about\nnon-integrated components is,\n\n69\n00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:13.390\nyour manufacturers,\nthey can sell you a base model of\n\n70\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.357\na motherboard at a different price points\nand if you wanna buy the Ferrari, well,\n\n71\n00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:19.507\nyou don't have to buy the Ferrari, right?\n\n72\n00:03:19.507 --> 00:03:22.364\nYou can, they can leave some of\nthese components out of it and\n\n73\n00:03:22.364 --> 00:03:26.120\nthen if you want you can get a reasonable\nprice you can always add those later.\n\n74\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.880\nSo one of the big things I want\nyou to keep in mind is that,\n\n75\n00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.470\nwhen it comes to integrated components,\nintegrated components\n\n76\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.410\nare those components that are soldered\ndirectly to the motherboard.\n\n77\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.420\nNow also keep in mind, like I said,\n\n78\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.820\nthat when integrated components fail,\nhopefully, we have a workaround at.\n\n79\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.660\nSometimes integrated components fail,\nand we can maybe put a non-integrated\n\n80\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.460\ncomponent in one of these sockets or\nslots and bring that functionality back.\n\n81\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.450\nHowever, there are times when integrated\ncomponents fail, and when they do,\n\n82\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.140\nunfortunately, you have to\nreplace the entire motherboard.\n\n83\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.020\nThe benefit of the non-integrated\ncomponents is the fact that we can always\n\n84\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.740\nexpand the functionality later.\n\n85\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.870\nAnd if those components fail, there's some\nkinda power shortage or short circuiting.\n\n86\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.760\nA lot of times all we have to\ndo is replace that component.\n\n87\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.590\n&gt;&gt; So\nare all these motherboards the same, and\n\n88\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.020\ndo they all have the same integrated\ncomponents in the same slots on them?\n\n89\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.530\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't and actually that's\none of the great things is that there is\n\n90\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.000\na variety of them out there, right?\n\n91\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.930\nYou can get those entry level,\nwhen manufacturers make them and\n\n92\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.010\nyou get those what we call\nentry level motherboards.\n\n93\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.850\nAnd again,\nthey give you the basic functionality,\n\n94\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.420\nthe basic computing experience.\n\n95\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.530\nBut, if you're somebody that\nneeds a little bit more power,\n\n96\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.390\nyou need a little more juice, your\ncomputing experience is one that kind of\n\n97\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.240\naccelerates everybody else's,\nyou could always get that functionality.\n\n98\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.940\nBut again, remember that's also\ngonna raise the price point, too.\n\n99\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.610\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, all right.\n\n100\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.860\nSo let's say we wanna go out and\nget a motherboard.\n\n101\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.085\nYou said they come in and\nthere's no one size fits all thing,\n\n102\n00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.610\nthere's different sizes?\n\n103\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.120\n&gt;&gt; There are.\n\n104\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.680\nSo for instance,\nthey have what is known as a form factor.\n\n105\n00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.490\nWhen we talk about form factor,\n\n106\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.260\nall right, form factor\ndescribes not just size, right?\n\n107\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.980\nSize is one of those things that form\nfactor describes but it also talks about\n\n108\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.290\nthe layout, all right, the arrangement\nof the components within the motherboard\n\n109\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.370\nthemselves, the unique characteristics\nof this type of motherboard.\n\n110\n00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.260\nAnd we will, towards the end of this\nepisode, we're gonna talk about some\n\n111\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.910\ndifferent form factors that you're gonna\nneed to be aware of, for this exam.\n\n112\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.680\nNow, I understand that when it comes down\nto buying and purchasing a motherboard,\n\n113\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.780\nyou're gonna have to do your research,\nout there in the real world.\n\n114\n00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.130\nBut for the A plus exam, you are gonna\nhave to know some of the specifications,\n\n115\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.790\nbecause understand this, when you're\nmoving into an IT technician type role,\n\n116\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.159\nyou have to speak the lingo, right?\n\n117\n00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.800\nWe can't sit there and call,\nI would never call myself a mechanic.\n\n118\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.931\nIn fact, Mike, you know that.\n\n119\n00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:38.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can break a car with\n\n120\n00:05:38.543 --> 00:05:39.361\nthe best of them.\n\n121\n00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:40.930\nBut if you wanna become a mechanic,\n\n122\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.730\nyou have to know what the different\nparts of a combustible engine is.\n\n123\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.582\nAnd the only thing I know is that\nI can make it combust and go boom.\n\n124\n00:05:46.582 --> 00:05:47.094\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:48.980\n&gt;&gt; So, you have to remember that.\n\n126\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.310\nYou're gonna be learning a new language,\nso that is important.\n\n127\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.200\nNow, the next thing that I'd like to talk\nabout are how do the components interact\n\n128\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.280\nwith one another on a motherboard?\n\n129\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.695\nAll right, well, on a motherboard we\nhave what are known as buses and traces.\n\n130\n00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.670\nI got a little diagram here and\nIf we look at it,\n\n131\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.290\nwe kinda got to zoom in and man,\nthis looks like a highway or\n\n132\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.090\na road map to downtown New York or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n133\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.360\nThese are little electrical conductors,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.450\nYou can hear them called traces, right?\n\n135\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.800\nCopper conductors, and what do they do?\n\n136\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.190\nWell, they take the data between between\nthese different components, right?\n\n137\n00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.540\nAnd they feed them in and out of the CPU\nto basically process and store your data.\n\n138\n00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.390\nNot always only store data but it might do\nthings like showing video as well, right?\n\n139\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.390\nIt might,\nyou might type on the keyboard, right?\n\n140\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.080\nAnd as you type on the keyboard that sends\nin a little electrical signal in here and\n\n141\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.820\nthat little electrical signal\nfollows along these pathways,\n\n142\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.900\nnotice boxes again, between the different\ncomponents on the motherboard, right?.\n\n143\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.260\nNow, I wanna take just a second here and\ntalk about when it comes to a motherboard,\n\n144\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.240\nwe have a very,\nvery important bus on the motherboard.\n\n145\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.170\nAnd again, I want you to think\nlike a bus is kinda highway.\n\n146\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.820\nAnd think about cars on a highway,\nthat's your data.\n\n147\n00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.680\nNow, data has really nothing more\nthan a series of electrical impulses.\n\n148\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.360\nIn fact, Mike you had said this many\nyears ago when we first met that\n\n149\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.670\nyou couldn't believe that this is what?\n\n150\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.673\nJust a series of electrical impulses?\n\n151\n00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:14.365\n&gt;&gt; I did, that's all it is.\n\n152\n00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:17.800\nIs that a crazy game that you're\nplaying with those high end graphics?\n\n153\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.014\nTurns out it's all just ones and zeroes.\n\n154\n00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:22.450\n&gt;&gt; And that's right and\nit's amazing that we can have things,\n\n155\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.200\nI think of video games out there\nthat you can play, and stuff, and\n\n156\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.280\nyou see all the crazy colors and\nthe fun that we can do.\n\n157\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.714\nAnd all it is, just like Mike said,\na little electrical impulses travelling.\n\n158\n00:07:32.714 --> 00:07:33.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:33.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:34.700\n&gt;&gt; Ones and zeroes.\n\n161\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.360\nNow, I mentioned that there is a very\nimportant bus that I want to talk about\n\n162\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.710\nbefore we dive back into the motherboard\ncuz buses are important.\n\n163\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.675\nAnd this type of bus actually dictates the\noverall performance that you're gonna see\n\n164\n00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:46.839\nout of the motherboard.\n\n165\n00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:50.283\nAnd more so,\nimagine having a car, let's say,\n\n166\n00:07:50.283 --> 00:07:53.143\na car that doesn't go too fast, right.\n\n167\n00:07:53.143 --> 00:07:56.192\nWell, you could put a lot of high\nend components in it, and well,\n\n168\n00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:59.859\nif the engine isn't that fast, you\nreally haven't done yourself much good.\n\n169\n00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:02.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why I want to kind of\n\n170\n00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:02.829\nmention this bus.\n\n171\n00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:07.132\nAnd that's something known as\nthe system bus, all right?\n\n172\n00:08:07.132 --> 00:08:12.131\nThe system bus's primary goal is\nto feed information from our main\n\n173\n00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:17.270\nsystem memory into the CPU, and\nback and forth if you will, right?\n\n174\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.896\nThis is also sometimes\ncalled the front-side bus.\n\n175\n00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:23.020\nNow, we're not going\nto be shy of acronyms.\n\n176\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.313\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:25.730\n&gt;&gt; Throughout this entire series.\n\n178\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.040\nAnd I'm stealing Mike's thunder here,\nbecause I heard him say years ago,\n\n179\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.850\nthis is like alphabet soup.\n\n180\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.660\nUnfortunately, that's what\nwe're gonna be feeding you.\n\n181\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.390\nBut we're gonna be trying to help you\neat the alphabet soup at the same time.\n\n182\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.597\n&gt;&gt; Make it tasty.\nPut a little salt in there for us.\n\n183\n00:08:37.597 --> 00:08:39.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n184\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.760\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's put a little salt in that.\n\n185\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.590\nFSB, right,\nyou might hear that called Front-side Bus.\n\n186\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.040\nNow why am I kind of\nharping on the System Bus?\n\n187\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.930\nWell, because the Front-side Bus,\nit's bus speed, right?\n\n188\n00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.460\nThe bus speed, if you will, is something\nthat basically dictates the overall\n\n189\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.590\nperformance of the motherboard itself.\n\n190\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.950\nAnd the lower bus speed or\nthe higher bus speed tells you how much\n\n191\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.850\nperformance you'll get\nout of this motherboard.\n\n192\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.841\n&gt;&gt; Would you think of that as the speed\nlimit on this highway you've been\n\n193\n00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.573\ntalking about?\n\n194\n00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:11.510\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, exactly.\n\n195\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.445\nAnd I think of it more like a governor,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:13.445 --> 00:09:17.434\nThe speed limit, it showed you\nhow fast you might wanna go, or\n\n197\n00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:19.210\nmay be how first you can go.\n\n198\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.281\nBut the governor tell you, I can say,\nokay, well your speed limit is 110 miles\n\n199\n00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:25.818\nan hour, but\nif I put a governor on there that says,\n\n200\n00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:30.170\nthe engine is only gonna allow you 60,\nyou kinda limited yourself, right?\n\n201\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.140\nSo there are three individual buses.\n\n202\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.610\nBoy, we're gonna talk about buses,\nbuses glory here.\n\n203\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.720\n[LAUGH] There are three\nindividual buses or\n\n204\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.830\ncomponents if you will,\ninside of the System Bus.\n\n205\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.610\nWe have what's known as the address bus.\n\n206\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.870\nAnd guys, you might hear this called\nsomething different out there,\n\n207\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.240\nthat's called the memory bus.\n\n208\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.600\nAll right, well your memory,\nright, main memory,\n\n209\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.400\nsystem memory, we see it as\nphysical chips on the mother board.\n\n210\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.260\nIn fact,\nif we could take a look right here,\n\n211\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.350\nwe look at the motherboard\nitself here at the sky cam,\n\n212\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.480\nyou can see that we have some main memory\nhere and we've got a CPU under there.\n\n213\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.380\nAnd feeding that information in and\nout of the CPU and\n\n214\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.950\nthe main memory is the system bus.\n\n215\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.300\nWell the address bus,\n\n216\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.290\nwhat it does is it says where in this\nchip should we store that memory.\n\n217\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.980\nNow I want you to keep in mind that\nwhen we talk about system memory,\n\n218\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.560\nwe see the physical devices themselves.\n\n219\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.790\nHowever, the physical devices themselves\nare really logically arranged.\n\n220\n00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.500\nSo what the address bus does\nis it tells basically the CPU,\n\n221\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.410\nI want you to send this data, let's say\nlike an address on a street, right?\n\n222\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.530\nI want you to send it to this location,\nright?\n\n223\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.770\nSo that's the address bus.\n\n224\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.100\nNow, the next bus that we\nhave here in our diagram,\n\n225\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.480\nyou will see,\nis the control bus, all right?\n\n226\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.220\nNow the control bus is\nkind of interesting.\n\n227\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.970\nThe control bus tells the CPU, is this\na write operation to memory, right?\n\n228\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.270\nNow we've located the, or located\nthe location, wow, that's redundant.\n\n229\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.900\nWe know the location in\nthe logical arrangement of memory,\n\n230\n00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.610\nwhere to store the data, right?\n\n231\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:06.550\nThe control bus, what it does is it tells\nthe CPU, write that data there, right?\n\n232\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.960\nPut that data there, or the operation\non the control bus might say, CPU,\n\n233\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.370\nI need you to find that information.\n\n234\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.500\nSo it tells it to read out of memory.\n\n235\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.130\nSo that's the read-write operations.\n\n236\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.400\nIf we send information in the memory,\nand we pull information out so\n\n237\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.050\nthat CPU can process it, right?\n\n238\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.940\nSo that's the control bus, is it a write\noperation or is it a read operation?\n\n239\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.531\nNow the data bus, what is that?\n\n240\n00:11:29.531 --> 00:11:30.212\nIt moves the data.\n\n241\n00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:34.512\n[LAUGH] And that's the last bus that\nactually transfers the information from\n\n242\n00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:36.200\nthe CPU into the main memory.\n\n243\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.585\nI want you to remember this for the exam,\n\n244\n00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:41.966\nbecause let's go back to\nthe analogy of the car, right?\n\n245\n00:11:41.966 --> 00:11:46.666\nWe've got a car and I'm gonna, I'll talk\nabout my old 84 Ford Ranger I had with,\n\n246\n00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.882\nI think it was a four-cylinder in it and\n\n247\n00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:53.370\nit wouldn't go 70 miles an hour downhill\nwith the wind pushing it, right?\n\n248\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:58.480\nWhat would it benefit me, if I would\nto put a super charger on that, right?\n\n249\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.880\nWell it'd be funny, but more than anything\nelse, but it's not gonna do anything.\n\n250\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.120\nIt's gonna essentially melt the engine.\n\n251\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.160\nWell again, with that Front-side Bus, if I\nput high-end components like great memory,\n\n252\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.640\njust the best memory, right?\n\n253\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:17.350\nAnd maybe I increase the voltage on\nthe CPU to make it process faster.\n\n254\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.338\nWell, guess what?\n\n255\n00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:21.413\nIf that highway right there,\nthat Front-side Bus can't handle it,\n\n256\n00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:23.193\nyou're not gonna see the performance.\n\n257\n00:12:23.193 --> 00:12:25.634\nSo you have to understand\nthat the Front-side Bus,\n\n258\n00:12:25.634 --> 00:12:28.861\nspecifically on a motherboard is\nthe limiting performance factor.\n\n259\n00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:30.862\nIt doesn't matter what you\nput in the motherboard.\n\n260\n00:12:30.862 --> 00:12:35.101\nIf that Front-side Bus or System Bus\ncannot handle that amount of data,\n\n261\n00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:39.286\nyou're essentially gonna have what\nwe call a bottleneck, all right?\n\n262\n00:12:39.286 --> 00:12:40.699\nNow what's a bottleneck?\n\n263\n00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:43.555\nA bottleneck, I want you to think of\nit as like the weakest link, right?\n\n264\n00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:46.111\nYou can have all these\npowerful components, but\n\n265\n00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:50.411\nif you've got one component in that system\nthat isn't slight, maybe it's not so\n\n266\n00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:54.527\npowerful, well it's going to limit\nthe performance of every other component\n\n267\n00:12:54.527 --> 00:12:55.928\nwithin the motherboard.\n\n268\n00:12:55.928 --> 00:13:01.040\nAnd that is very, very important when\nit comes to motherboards in general.\n\n269\n00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.061\nNow there are some other things\nthat I wanna talk about when it\n\n270\n00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:05.788\ncomes to the motherboard itself.\n\n271\n00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:08.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwe were talking about that system memory.\n\n272\n00:13:08.543 --> 00:13:12.740\nNow is that an integrated component or\nis that a non-integrated component?\n\n273\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.140\n&gt;&gt; That is a good question.\n\n274\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.550\nIn fact, let’s take you back to\nthe motherboard itself here and we\n\n275\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.660\nwill show you that, if you look,\nif I push down on these tabs, right?\n\n276\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.340\nI'll push down on one tab, and\nI'll push down on two tabs.\n\n277\n00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.390\nSee if I can do this without breaking it.\n\n278\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.130\nAnd we lift that memory and\nbe very careful with these memory sticks.\n\n279\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.500\nNotice that I can take that memory module,\nand I could take it right out, right?\n\n280\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.010\nSo to answer your question,\nthat will be a non-integrated component.\n\n281\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.820\nAnd that's kind of a good thing,\nbecause memory has come down in price, but\n\n282\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.710\nmemory still fails.\n\n283\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.510\nAnd you have to be careful.\n\n284\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.860\nI will tell you that some memory Mike is\nactually integrated into the motherboard.\n\n285\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.000\nWe're seeing that with a lot of small form\nfactor mobile devices where these chips\n\n286\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.870\nthat we have on this RAM module here,\nwill actually be integrated and\n\n287\n00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.940\nlook nothing more than a chip\nthat's on the motherboard.\n\n288\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.040\nAnd that's for a really,\nreally small form factor devices.\n\n289\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.460\nSo it's kind of gone both ways.\n\n290\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.024\nMaybe in the earlier days,\n\n291\n00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:11.632\nyou might have only found it in\nthese slots on the motherboard.\n\n292\n00:14:11.632 --> 00:14:14.845\nToday, you can even find for\nspace saving and again really,\n\n293\n00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:19.004\nreally thin devices where they don't\nhave a lot of profile room, if you will.\n\n294\n00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:22.889\nWhere they actually take those chips off\nof that module and they embed them and\n\n295\n00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:24.880\nintegrate them right into the board.\n\n296\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Which might be a good thing,\ncuz I can get it all at once.\n\n297\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.966\nBut that also limits my ability to change\nthat out later or increase my performance.\n\n298\n00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:35.734\n&gt;&gt; That's right, let's say that your\nnewest video game comes out and\n\n299\n00:14:35.734 --> 00:14:38.984\nyou're like, man,\nwe'll just throw numbers out here.\n\n300\n00:14:38.984 --> 00:14:41.690\nAnd when we get into our memory section,\nwe'll talk a little bit more about this.\n\n301\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.820\nBut I've got 16 GB of RAM, right?\n\n302\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.560\nAnd it's embedded into the motherboard,\nright?\n\n303\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.114\nMike goes out and he buys a newer\nvideo game, and it needs more RAM.\n\n304\n00:14:52.114 --> 00:14:57.432\nAnd not maybe more RAM as in quantity,\nbut it needs to be faster, right?\n\n305\n00:14:57.432 --> 00:15:00.452\nThe problem is if it's integrated in\nthe motherboard, we can't sit here and\n\n306\n00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:03.439\n[INAUDIBLE] all those chips and then\ninstall them one by one to try to upgrade.\n\n307\n00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:08.463\nSo again, keep in mind that upgrading\ncomponents non-integrated components like\n\n308\n00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:13.550\na video card, like a network adapter which\nagain, we will talk about these pieces.\n\n309\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.870\nI can upgrade and get more performance.\n\n310\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.710\nThe integrated components unfortunately,\nyou're kinda stuck with what you have.\n\n311\n00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.020\nThe only way I could integrate or\nnot integrate but\n\n312\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.778\nupgrade those,\nis to replace the entire motherboard.\n\n313\n00:15:23.778 --> 00:15:26.403\nSo that is something,\nI'm glad you asked that question,\n\n314\n00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:29.618\nbecause that could be not only a deciding\nfactor of what device you buy,\n\n315\n00:15:29.618 --> 00:15:31.724\nit could be a limiting\nfactor at the same time.\n\n316\n00:15:31.724 --> 00:15:32.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n317\n00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.100\nSo we've got the motherboard there.\n\n318\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.864\nWe've got the buses that are moving\nthat data back and forth between our,\n\n319\n00:15:37.864 --> 00:15:41.350\nboth integrated components and\nour non-integrated components.\n\n320\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.900\nWe saw the RAM slots for my system memory.\n\n321\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.187\nWhat are all the other\nthings on that motherboard?\n\n322\n00:15:46.187 --> 00:15:47.808\n&gt;&gt; Batteries,\nyou say well wait a second here.\n\n323\n00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:50.277\nYou got a battery on your motherboard?\n\n324\n00:15:50.277 --> 00:15:53.510\nYes, we do.\nWe've got a very, very important battery.\n\n325\n00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.740\nNow in our BIOS episode,\n\n326\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.441\nwe talked about something known as\nthe basic input output system, right?\n\n327\n00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:02.353\nWe said that was a non-volatile memory\nregion that stores manufactured defined\n\n328\n00:16:02.353 --> 00:16:06.225\nsettings on how to start all of these\ncomponents that we see on the motherboard.\n\n329\n00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:09.137\nBut I also said that they were\nsome user defined settings.\n\n330\n00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:11.740\nWe showed you how you can turn\nthings on and off, right?\n\n331\n00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.410\nWhere do those settings get stored?\n\n332\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.979\nThey get stored in a very low voltage or\nvolatile, get that right,\n\n333\n00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.991\n[LAUGH] volatile memory region,\nthat stores that data.\n\n334\n00:16:19.991 --> 00:16:24.131\nSo that when we shut the computer off,\nthis battery is providing a little bit of\n\n335\n00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:28.102\nelectrical current to keep that data\nas a volatile memory stores refresh.\n\n336\n00:16:28.102 --> 00:16:31.693\nSo every time we start the machine\nour user defined settings,\n\n337\n00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:36.458\nwhether that interface is turn on or off,\nthe integrated video card is turned on or\n\n338\n00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:37.910\noff stays behind.\n\n339\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.303\nAnd that's one that's very important.\n\n340\n00:16:39.303 --> 00:16:43.208\nIt's one you need to know about when it\ncomes to any kind of motherboard that you\n\n341\n00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:44.701\nmight be using inside of a PC.\n\n342\n00:16:44.701 --> 00:16:46.240\nSo let me go ahead and show you that.\n\n343\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.540\nYou can see right here that there's\nactually a little battery and\n\n344\n00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.500\nI know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n345\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.450\nIf we can, there we go.\n\n346\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.930\nI'm gonna make that shine right there and\nblind everybody out there.\n\n347\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.278\nSorry guys about your retinas out there,\n[LAUGH] but that is our,\n\n348\n00:16:57.278 --> 00:16:58.900\nthat is a little CMOS battery.\n\n349\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.590\nRemember what we said, CMOS is the\ncomplimentary metal oxide semiconductor.\n\n350\n00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.170\nBig long acronym that just basically\nmeans, [LAUGH] it's a means for\n\n351\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.300\nstoring your user defined settings.\n\n352\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.170\nNow this little battery is\na 2032 three volt battery.\n\n353\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.160\nAnd you might be saying wow,\nwait a second, Wes,\n\n354\n00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.830\ndo I really need to know that for\nthe exam?\n\n355\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.994\nWell I'm not sure, but if you do,\nwe've given it to you.\n\n356\n00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:21.300\n[LAUGH] Because of the fact that,\n\n357\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.920\nthe little three volt battery there,\nit's what provides that current.\n\n358\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.070\nAnd in the BIOS episode that we did,\n\n359\n00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.640\nI told you that one of the things\nthat you could tell, a telltale sign\n\n360\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.110\nthat that battery isn't doing its job\nanymore is the system date and time.\n\n361\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.670\nIf you boot your computer up and\nyou randomly say,\n\n362\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.110\nlet's say you bought this computer.\n\n363\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.920\nWe've got a few computers in here that\nwe've had for quite a long time and\n\n364\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.810\nlet's give you a random number.\n\n365\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:48.410\nLet's say it's 2017, and let's say we\nbought these computers in 2015, right?\n\n366\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.850\nIf I set the time or Mike sets the date\nand tine on the system, reboots it,\n\n367\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.070\nand it's 2017, right, but we see the\nsystem time has actually reverted itself\n\n368\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.870\nback to 2015, that's because hard\ncoded in the BIOS was the date and\n\n369\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.320\ntime when this was released\nfrom the manufacturer.\n\n370\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.080\nAnd what it's doing is saying I\ndon't know what setting you've set\n\n371\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.340\nbecause that battery is no longer\nproviding the current, so every time you\n\n372\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.590\nshut the machine down, it erases the CMOS\nand it loses what the system time is.\n\n373\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.970\nSo I wanna give you a piece of advice.\n\n374\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.010\nNow we're gonna talk about troubleshooting\nin another episode but let's go ahead and\n\n375\n00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.860\njust talk about that battery real quick.\n\n376\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.350\nThat CMOS battery, good practice,\nreplace it every three years.\n\n377\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.902\nAll right?\nAnd\n\n378\n00:18:26.902 --> 00:18:30.810\nwhen I say replace it every three years, I\ndon't care if it's good or bad, all right.\n\n379\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.300\nDon't wait, okay?\n\n380\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.218\nNow, in a home environment,\nit might not be so bad.\n\n381\n00:18:36.218 --> 00:18:39.440\nI know I've got a computer\nthat I've had seven years now.\n\n382\n00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.821\nAnd I think you Mike you've had some,\ntoo, that have gone a long time and\n\n383\n00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:44.990\nnever replaced the CMOS battery.\n\n384\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.702\nBut remember, you're gonna be an IT\ntechnician that could be working in\n\n385\n00:18:47.702 --> 00:18:48.823\nan enterprise environment.\n\n386\n00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:53.349\nAnd the last thing you wanna do is\nhave computers start, I don't know,\n\n387\n00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:58.101\nmismatching times and causing all kinds\nof havoc on your network because we\n\n388\n00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:02.190\nhaven't replaced a very,\nvery inexpensive battery, right?\n\n389\n00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.588\nSo, remember to replace that every\nthree years whether you need to or not.\n\n390\n00:19:06.588 --> 00:19:09.921\nIn home environment,\nif you don't want to, that's okay, but\n\n391\n00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:12.690\nif that CMOS battery dies\ndon't blame us for sure.\n\n392\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.180\n&gt;&gt; These might be something then\nthat I wanna keep a few of on hand\n\n393\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\n\n394\n00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.840\nin fact a company that you and\nI used to work for,\n\n395\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.610\nI know they had stacks of them, right?\n\n396\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.827\nAnd they were times where we would go\nthrough it and I think you did it many\n\n397\n00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:28.693\ntimes too, where you go through 45 to\n80 computers and, what were you doing?\n\n398\n00:19:28.693 --> 00:19:30.913\nWell, you were just opening\nthe motherboard up and\n\n399\n00:19:30.913 --> 00:19:34.330\nyou were popping that battery out and\nthen popping batteries back in.\n\n400\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.157\nAnd again, it seems like maybe it's\na little monotonous, but it's a very\n\n401\n00:19:38.157 --> 00:19:42.415\nsimplistic maintenance technique that can\nhelp basically just prolong the life of\n\n402\n00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.663\nwell, I guess the system clock\n[LAUGH] more than anything else.\n\n403\n00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:47.350\nAll right, so\nthat’s one of the things Mike.\n\n404\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.410\nNow some of the other things here we've\ngot, we have on these motherboards in fact\n\n405\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.290\nright here we can show you that these\nare what is known as expansion slots.\n\n406\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.800\nNow, we're going to talk about\na little bit later just like we said\n\n407\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.060\nspecifications.\n\n408\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.770\nThere are some different specifications,\n\n409\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.480\nthere are different kinds\nof expansion slots.\n\n410\n00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.000\nThese are where you put your\nnon-integrated components, and\n\n411\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.100\nunlike your RAM slots here, if you will,\nthose are, that's a non-integrated\n\n412\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.190\ncomponent, but the expansion slots, well,\nwhy are they called expansion slots?\n\n413\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.845\nThey're called expansion slots\nbecause they expand the functionality\n\n414\n00:20:16.845 --> 00:20:17.795\nof the motherboard.\n\n415\n00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:21.805\nAll right, and when we look at\nmanufactures, when they release their\n\n416\n00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:25.285\nprinted circuit boards, right,\nwhen they make these motherboards.\n\n417\n00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:29.765\nAnd let's say they do an all-in-one like\nDell or HP and they're building computers.\n\n418\n00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:32.155\nThese expansion slots\ndo a couple of things.\n\n419\n00:20:32.155 --> 00:20:36.385\nThey give the manufacture the ability to\nvary the price points on their system\n\n420\n00:20:36.385 --> 00:20:40.930\nbuilds or their systems, their computers\nthat they sell, because, if you need basic\n\n421\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.260\nfunctionality, you might find that you\nare very limited on the expandability.\n\n422\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.060\nThe amount of expansion slot that\nyou have within the system, right?\n\n423\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.390\nBut, you can also see and\n\n424\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:54.280\nI know that I've seen as a $700\nboard which is barely expensive for\n\n425\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.500\njust a board [LAUGH] that has tons\nof these, and they're not populated.\n\n426\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.330\nSo the point being is, it gives\nthe manufactures the ability to vary what\n\n427\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.010\nprice point they release\ntheir motherboards out there.\n\n428\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.900\nIf you need the functionality,\nyou can expand the functionality.\n\n429\n00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.790\nIt might be something else that is\na deciding factor when it comes to buying\n\n430\n00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:20.120\na motherboard, is how many of these do I\nhave, what functionality do I have now?\n\n431\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.070\nBut more so,\nam I gonna expand the functionality later?\n\n432\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.232\nRight, because we say that, for instance,\nif it's memory and it's integrated into\n\n433\n00:21:27.232 --> 00:21:31.230\nthe board, well, if we wanna upgrade,\nwe have to replace the motherboard.\n\n434\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.680\nWell you might find yourself at\na certain point where you've populated,\n\n435\n00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.680\na little jargon there, populated just\nmeans installed every one of these cards\n\n436\n00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.320\nthat you have on the motherboard, and\nyou need some additional functionality.\n\n437\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.560\nIn that case, again,\n\n438\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.280\nthat might be a limiting factor\non what motherboard you buy.\n\n439\n00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.250\n&gt;&gt; So now Wes, help me out here.\n\n440\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.090\nSo you keep saying we can\nexpand our functionality.\n\n441\n00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.600\nCan you give me a quick example of what\nkind of functionality I might add by\n\n442\n00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.340\npopulating those expansion slots?\n\n443\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.470\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n444\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.290\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlook at the motherboard.\n\n445\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.710\nAnd I'll give you an example\non this one here.\n\n446\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.710\nAnd I know because I booted\ninto the BIOS on this one.\n\n447\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.680\nThere is a couple of chips that\nI wanna talk about real quick.\n\n448\n00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.460\nWe'll come back to them, but\nthere are a couple of chips on here and\n\n449\n00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.830\nwhat they do is they literally understand\nhow to compute graphics, right.\n\n450\n00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.810\nWe call them GPUs, it's an integrated\ngraphics processing unit.\n\n451\n00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.240\nThe difference between that and the CPU\nas that GPU solely focuses on graphics.\n\n452\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.820\nWell guess what,\nin the chips on this motherboard,\n\n453\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.680\nright, the little chips that are on this\nmotherboard, it understands graphics.\n\n454\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.610\nBut usually with an integrated component,\n\n455\n00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.210\nit might not give you\nhigh end functionality.\n\n456\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.860\nNow, that's as technology progresses,\nthat might not be the case.\n\n457\n00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.790\nBut what if I want more video?\n\n458\n00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.060\nWhat if I wanna get more\nframes per second, right?\n\n459\n00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.228\nWhen I'm out there and\nI'm doing that first person shooter and\n\n460\n00:22:49.228 --> 00:22:51.811\nI wanna get a little bit\nmore action out of the game.\n\n461\n00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:55.666\nWell the integrated component might\nnot do exactly what I wanted to do,\n\n462\n00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:58.182\nit might not give me\nthe level of performance.\n\n463\n00:22:58.182 --> 00:23:04.666\nSo I can expand the functionality, right,\nby taking one of these graphics cards and\n\n464\n00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:09.370\nwe pop that down into one of\nthe slots on the motherboard.\n\n465\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.060\nAnd this component has a whole\nbunch of circuitry in it and\n\n466\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.590\nit can handle the higher performance, if\nyou will, than the integrated component.\n\n467\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.030\nSo when I say expanding the functionality,\n\n468\n00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:25.410\nwhat I mean is, If you have\nthe expansion slots there, and a device\n\n469\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.750\nthat's integrated in the component\ndoesn't give you the performance, or\n\n470\n00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.370\nif you don't even have that functionality,\nyou can bring that functionality.\n\n471\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.950\nFor instance, at, it's not so today,\nbecause almost every computer you see has\n\n472\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.370\nalmost 10 USB ports, but in earlier days,\nyou might have two USB ports, right?\n\n473\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.490\nWell, I don't know about you Mike, but\n\n474\n00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.050\nI have rat's nests on the back of my\ncomputers plugging in everything I can.\n\n475\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.650\nSo what would I need to\ndo if I wanted to hook up\n\n476\n00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.110\nmore things to the computer via USB?\n\n477\n00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.834\nWell, we could put in a hub and as we'll\nlearn later in our networking section,\n\n478\n00:23:56.834 --> 00:23:59.348\nthat can be a little bit\nproblematic in and of itself.\n\n479\n00:23:59.348 --> 00:24:03.201\nOr, I could take one of these cards\nthat has additional USB ports and\n\n480\n00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:04.225\nI can install it.\n\n481\n00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:08.578\nI can put it down in that expansion slot,\nand now I've gone from Let's say,\n\n482\n00:24:08.578 --> 00:24:13.066\nlike I said, back in the old days,\ntwo of those USB ports, maybe on up to 12,\n\n483\n00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:18.640\ngiving you additional functionality and\nthat's why they call them expansion slots.\n\n484\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, what else do we\nhave on that mother board of yours?-\n\n485\n00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.063\n&gt;&gt; Boy, we've got a lot, don't we?\n\n486\n00:24:22.063 --> 00:24:24.806\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Some of the things that we have\n\n487\n00:24:24.806 --> 00:24:26.650\nhere I want to kind of go over.\n\n488\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:31.230\nI said there is an important Set of chips,\ncollection of chips, if you will,\n\n489\n00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.350\non the motherboard.\n\n490\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.970\nAnd it's kind of hard to see on this one.\n\n491\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.796\nThis is an Intel-based board.\n\n492\n00:24:35.796 --> 00:24:39.800\nIntel-based boards, and I'll clarify this\nin a second, they kind of do something\n\n493\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.990\na little bit different than some of these\nother ones that you see here, all right.\n\n494\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.510\nSo for instance,\nyou'll see that we have, and\n\n495\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:49.140\nin fact this one, this is probably\na good one to show you here.\n\n496\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.450\nAll right, this little board here\nit has two very important chips.\n\n497\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.580\nLet me see if I can get that in the,\nthere we go.\n\n498\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.590\nAll right now,\n\n499\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.500\nwell you can't really see them cuz\nthey got what are called heat sinks.\n\n500\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.410\nAnd when we get into cooling you'll\nnotice that that's something that can\n\n501\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.270\ncool a processing unit, if you will,\n\n502\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.140\nfrom getting overheating\nprotects from thermal damage.\n\n503\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.330\nBut I want you to see that there are two.\n\n504\n00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.790\nAll right, these are called a chipset,\nall right?\n\n505\n00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.172\nNow, a chipset is not a set of Pringles.\n\n506\n00:25:15.172 --> 00:25:16.160\nThat's not what we're talking about here.\n\n507\n00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we're talking about here is\n\n508\n00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:22.510\nthe major,\nalmost like traffic controllers.\n\n509\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.600\nThey are what govern all of\nthe communications that go across\n\n510\n00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.360\nthis entire board.\n\n511\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.810\nRemember, we said this is a bunch of\nhighways all interconnected, right?\n\n512\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.770\nWe have interconnections and I told you we\nhave little electrical impulses floating\n\n513\n00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.460\neverywhere across this board.\n\n514\n00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.468\nWell, I want you to think about these\ntwo chips as actually being the traffic\n\n515\n00:25:39.468 --> 00:25:40.087\ncontrollers.\n\n516\n00:25:40.087 --> 00:25:43.701\nThey're the ones like a traffic cop that's\nout in the middle of the road during\n\n517\n00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:47.059\na storm when the lights are out saying,\nokay, all right, you go ahead.\n\n518\n00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:50.564\nAnd then you send your information across\nthe system board into the processor, and\n\n519\n00:25:50.564 --> 00:25:51.525\nit'll chew it up.\n\n520\n00:25:51.525 --> 00:25:54.305\nAnd then I'll take it and\nI'll put it back in the memory.\n\n521\n00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:58.025\nDown here, we have a chip that says\nall of this other stuff, right,\n\n522\n00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:01.580\nlike these integrated components\nthat we'll talk about coming up.\n\n523\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.380\nYeah, you're gonna have to go\nthrough me and then, I will dictate\n\n524\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.920\nwho turned around and talked to this\nguy that allows that information.\n\n525\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.177\nOop, if I get my finger going the right\nway here [LAUGH] in and out of the CPU,\n\n526\n00:26:13.177 --> 00:26:13.874\nall right.\n\n527\n00:26:13.874 --> 00:26:15.113\nThat's called a chip set.\n\n528\n00:26:15.113 --> 00:26:19.990\nNow, a chip set has some specific\nnames that we wanna be aware of.\n\n529\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.010\nFor the exam, all right.\n\n530\n00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.367\nAnd it's got a couple of\ndifferent types of names, and\n\n531\n00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:26.608\nthis is where it gets confusing, and\nwe hope we can help you out on this one.\n\n532\n00:26:26.608 --> 00:26:30.650\nNow, normally, you hear things like,\nnorth bridge and south bridge, all right.\n\n533\n00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.320\nI want you think of\nthe layout of the board.\n\n534\n00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.270\nIn fact, let's go ahead, and\nlet's look at that board here just again.\n\n535\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.930\nAnd I know there's probably,\njust because of the arrangement,\n\n536\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.200\ndoesn't look maybe the best.\n\n537\n00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.890\nThe northbridge is kinda like\nthe commander in chief of traffic\n\n538\n00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.270\ncontrollers, if you will.\n\n539\n00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:49.420\nThe northbridge sits between\nthe main memory and the ram.\n\n540\n00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.390\nIn fact,\nit sits right there on the system bus.\n\n541\n00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.940\nAnd it is what dictates information\ngoing in and out of the CPU.\n\n542\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.680\nAnd then, we have what's known\nas the southbridge, alright?\n\n543\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.460\nNow, the southbridge is\nwhat controls things,\n\n544\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.060\nwith the exception of modern video,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n545\n00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.790\nWe'll get into that a little bit later.\n\n546\n00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.120\nIt controls everything coming\nfrom your hard drive interfaces,\n\n547\n00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.700\nwhich you can see some\nstorage interfaces here.\n\n548\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.190\nThese are serial ATA ports.\n\n549\n00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.241\nEverything that's coming back from the\nexternal peripherals that you connect to\n\n550\n00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:19.186\nthe motherboard.\n\n551\n00:27:19.186 --> 00:27:23.361\nIt says, okay, I'll prioritize,\nbased on whatever, I guess,\n\n552\n00:27:23.361 --> 00:27:28.040\nthe demand priority is,\nwho's going to communicate first, right?\n\n553\n00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:33.040\nAnd then, the south bridge will\ncommunicate with the north bridge sending\n\n554\n00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.450\nthat information, again,\nin and out of the CPU.\n\n555\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.470\nSo you can see south bridge, north bridge.\n\n556\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.890\nAnd it really came out as a name\nin relationship to the CPU and\n\n557\n00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.470\nthe location on the motherboard.\n\n558\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.050\nAnd today, things have gotten a little bit\nsquirrelly because we have different size\n\n559\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.200\nform factors and everything, but for\nthe most part in the older days,\n\n560\n00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.270\nyou could look right away and\n\n561\n00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.840\nsay I know what the North Bridge is\nbecause it's sitting closest to the CPU.\n\n562\n00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.550\nI can see the South Bridge because it's\nsouth or the farthest away from the CPU.\n\n563\n00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.450\nAll right, so now that you guys have a\nlittle bit of an understanding like that,\n\n564\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.088\nlet's go ahead and throw a massive\nrock in the compound of understanding.\n\n565\n00:28:06.088 --> 00:28:10.007\n[LAUGH] Because Intel Doesn't\ncall it that at all.\n\n566\n00:28:10.007 --> 00:28:11.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right?\n\n567\n00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.730\nIntel calls their North Bridge an MCH.\n\n568\n00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.840\nYes, I know another acronym.\n\n569\n00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.780\nMCH is something known as\nthe Memory Controller Hub.\n\n570\n00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.360\nAll right.\nRemember,\n\n571\n00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.880\nwe told you that North Bridge\ncontrols access between the CPU and\n\n572\n00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.470\nthe memory Well, Intel makes it easy.\n\n573\n00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.960\nThey call it the memory controller hub.\n\n574\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.520\nIt controls access to memory.\n\n575\n00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.110\nAnd essentially,\nit's the CPU that uses memory, right?\n\n576\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.270\nThey call that south bridge and I love the\nnames, it sounds like I'm picking on it,\n\n577\n00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.180\nbut it makes more sense to me than\nnorth bridge and south bridge,\n\n578\n00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.790\nis that Intel calls the south\nbridge what's known as the ICH.\n\n579\n00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.760\nThat's the input output controller hub,\nall right?\n\n580\n00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.240\nNow, if we can look and show you why I\nthink that makes a lot more sense is\n\n581\n00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.740\nif we look at this board,\nhere are our input and outputs, right?\n\n582\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.390\nThese are our peripheral devices,\ninput and output,\n\n583\n00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.980\nwe've got our hard drives\nwhere we store data.\n\n584\n00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.780\nSo it controls the input, output between\nthe memory controller hub and itself.\n\n585\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.160\nSo northbridge, all right, for\nthe most part if you hear that acronym or\n\n586\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.395\nthat term, that means that chip that\nIt sits right there between the CPU and\n\n587\n00:29:17.395 --> 00:29:18.425\nthe memory.\n\n588\n00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:23.175\nIt's also called the MCH,\nI can tell you today, in fact,\n\n589\n00:29:23.175 --> 00:29:27.735\nlet's look at this intel board right here.\n\n590\n00:29:27.735 --> 00:29:30.359\nIf we look at this intel board,\nwhere is it?\n\n591\n00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.770\nIt's not there.\n\n592\n00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.860\nRight?\nAnd that's because Intel.\n\n593\n00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.950\nTheir chips are very,\nvery, how do I say this?\n\n594\n00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.680\nThey're very efficient.\n\n595\n00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.680\nThey take the memory controller hub and\nthey integrate it right into the CPU.\n\n596\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.970\nAnd that just means,\nthink of those data paths, right.\n\n597\n00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.520\nThe farther the path is the longer\nit's gonna take to travel across that,\n\n598\n00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.780\ndata is,\nmeans it's gonna introduce latency.\n\n599\n00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.470\nWell, Intel said well,\nlet's just lower the latency.\n\n600\n00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.610\nWe'll take the memory controller hub,\nwe'll put it right on the CPU.\n\n601\n00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.500\nThe southbridge is down here,\nyou can see, or ICH in an Intel world.\n\n602\n00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.730\nSo you can see, that Intel does it\na little bit differently, but for\n\n603\n00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.820\nthe most part,\nthe concepts will be the same.\n\n604\n00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, fantastic stuff, Wes.\n\n605\n00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.540\nI know we've got a lot more to go\nover when it comes to components in\n\n606\n00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.420\nthat motherboard, but unfortunately, we're\nout of time for this particular episode.\n\n607\n00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.600\nWhich means, we're gonna have\nto come back with a part two.\n\n608\n00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.540\nSo any parting words for our viewers?\n\n609\n00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.790\n&gt;&gt; No, just remember that when\nyou are going to think about\n\n610\n00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:29.420\npurchasing a motherboard just understand\nthat there are a lot of different\n\n611\n00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.890\ncontributing factors to a good board or\n\n612\n00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.490\na board that maybe doesn't\ngive you enough functionality.\n\n613\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.840\nJust pay attention to the lay out of the\nboard and you'll get the right decision.\n\n614\n00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, thanks for that Wes.\n\n615\n00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.049\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n616\n00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:45.055\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n617\n00:30:45.055 --> 00:30:45.884\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n618\n00:30:45.884 -->

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.310\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing our CompTIA A+ 901.\n\n7\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.340\nAnd in this episode we're actually doing\na part two on motherboards and components.\n\n8\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.400\nSo if you missed part one,\nmake sure you go back and check that out.\n\n9\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.030\nWe're gonna dive right back in,\npick up where we left off, and\n\n10\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.760\nhere to do that with is Mr.\nWes Brian, welcome back Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.086\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:39.383\nYep, that's right, we have a lot of\ncomponents that we need to talk about.\n\n13\n00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:43.330\nSo like Mike said,\nthat's why we're in a part two.\n\n14\n00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.970\nIn the first part we talked about some\nof the components that you can see on\n\n15\n00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.600\na motherboard.\n\n16\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.460\nWe talked a little bit about things\nlike your RAM slots, expansion slots.\n\n17\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.651\nWe talked about some of the chips,\nif you will, the computer processors,\n\n18\n00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:56.402\nif you will, that are on the motherboard,\ncalled the chipset.\n\n19\n00:00:56.402 --> 00:01:00.096\nAnd if any of this doesn't seem familiar\nto you, like Mike said, go back and\n\n20\n00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:02.315\nwatch part one and\ncome back to part two here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:05.186\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, we talked about\nnorthbridge and southbridge, a couple of\n\n22\n00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:08.640\nthe chips, as you said, that are typically\nintegrated on that motherboard.\n\n23\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.175\nBut there's one big chip on that mother\nboard that we haven't talked about yet.\n\n24\n00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:14.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the one that\nyou never wanna forget about.\n\n25\n00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.424\nApparently my memory needs upgrading.\n\n26\n00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:21.130\n[LAUGH] But one of the things that we have\nto also talk about is the CPU, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.930\nThe CPU is the central processing unit,\nyou might hear it called the processor,\n\n28\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.980\nI've heard it microprocessor before.\n\n29\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.036\nThey don't really call,\n\n30\n00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:30.920\n[LAUGH] I don't really hear it called\nmicroprocessor too much anymore.\n\n31\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.507\nThat actually goes back to the earlier\ndays when a guy by the name of\n\n32\n00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:36.094\nGary Goodall went to Intel and\nhe said, these things are more than\n\n33\n00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:38.564\njust controllers,\nthey can actually process information.\n\n34\n00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.830\nSo they called them microprocessors\nin the earlier days.\n\n35\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.410\nBut what we wanna look at is the\nconnections specifically that they make to\n\n36\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.010\nthe motherboard.\n\n37\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.896\nWe'll talk a lot more about CPUs,\nand dive into what they are and\n\n38\n00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:51.200\nsome of the different types and\ncharacteristics.\n\n39\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.674\nBut for the motherboard itself, every\nmotherboard is going to have one of these\n\n40\n00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:59.570\nsockets, where we install, really,\nthe brains of the operation.\n\n41\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.452\nAnd so if we can take a look here, and\nlike you've seen in the first episode,\n\n42\n00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:03.994\nwe've got a few different boards here.\n\n43\n00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:07.730\nJust so you guys can see that they come\nin all different shapes and sizes.\n\n44\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.520\nWell, one of the things that\nyou also have to keep in mind,\n\n45\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.180\nis they could have different socket types.\n\n46\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.510\nNow, what you don't see on\nthis one is the CPU socket,\n\n47\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.570\nbecause we have a couple\nof things attached to it.\n\n48\n00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.035\nWe have the processor that's set down on\nit, we have this little metal fin type\n\n49\n00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:27.120\nthing, kind of looks like a radiator,\nit's called a heat sink, and then a fan.\n\n50\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.420\nBut below that,\nwe have these type of sockets.\n\n51\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.897\nNow, Intel is a little bit different, and\n\n52\n00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:33.545\nwe'll get into the specifics\nhere in a second.\n\n53\n00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:39.960\nBut this is a CPU socket, and it's where\nyou install, if you will, the CPU itself.\n\n54\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.770\nNow you're looking at\ntwo of the same types.\n\n55\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.210\nLet me go ahead and\nput this board a little bit closer, here.\n\n56\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.580\nYou can see that there\nare little openings, right here.\n\n57\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.020\nAnd these are where the pins on the bottom\nof a CPU are gonna make contact.\n\n58\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.870\nAnd more importantly, when we install it,\nit will make that electrical\n\n59\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.080\nconnection to the motherboard that allows\nthe processor to process that information.\n\n60\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.380\nNow, this is something that\nis called a PGA socket.\n\n61\n00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.811\nNow Mike I know you're a golfer, but\n\n62\n00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:10.289\nunfortunately we're not talking about the\nProfessional Golf Association on this one.\n\n63\n00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.770\nWe're talking about something\nknown as a pin grid array.\n\n64\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.650\nNow, pin grid array is a type\nof socket that has well,\n\n65\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.890\nthe pins are on the bottom of the CPU.\n\n66\n00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.843\nAnd the openings, if you will,\nor the ports on the socket,\n\n67\n00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:25.399\nare the openings that\nthe pins will be inserted to.\n\n68\n00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:29.210\nNow you might notice that in this one\nthere's this little handle right here.\n\n69\n00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.619\nAnd this little handle is\nactually a really clever design.\n\n70\n00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:35.600\nIn the earlier days you\ndidn't have this handle.\n\n71\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.520\nWhen I say early days, I'm really talking\nabout some of the very first PCs that\n\n72\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.082\nwere out there, they didn't have this.\n\n73\n00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:44.245\nWell I want you to understand that when\nyou put an electrical current on a CPU,\n\n74\n00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:46.820\nit's gonna get very, very hot.\n\n75\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.970\nWell, what happens when you turn it off?\n\n76\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.520\nWell, it's gonna cool down.\n\n77\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.401\nSo, you have this expansion and contract,\nexpand and contract, and expand and\n\n78\n00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.910\ncontract, because of the heating and\nthe cooling the CPU.\n\n79\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.150\nNow, the problem in the early days is the\nfact that that would cause something known\n\n80\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.380\nas chip creep.\n\n81\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.454\nChip creep just basically means that quite\nliterally the CPU that was installed\n\n82\n00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:10.703\nthe socket could walk its way out, grow\nlegs, and, I don't know, take a break for\n\n83\n00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:11.515\nthe day [LAUGH].\n\n84\n00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:14.858\nBut it would cause problem, because it\nwould move it's way out of its socket, and\n\n85\n00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.152\nthen, again,\nwe're not making electrical contact.\n\n86\n00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:21.180\nAnd all kinds of problems can happen,\nshort circuiting, even damaging the CPU.\n\n87\n00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.400\nThe other problem that you have,\n\n88\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.532\nis if you look at the socket\nitself here on this motherboard.\n\n89\n00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:30.580\nThese pins, well in this case,\nthe openings, are very, very small, and\n\n90\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.160\nit's very easy that if you\nwere to install a CPU,\n\n91\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.150\nyou could potentially bend the pins.\n\n92\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.470\nSo they came out with this unique\ndesign that actually moves.\n\n93\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.370\nI don't know if you can see in\nrelationship to my finger there,\n\n94\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370\nthat the socket is actually\nmoving from side to side.\n\n95\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.904\nAnd what it does is,\nit opens up this socket, and\n\n96\n00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:56.957\nit allows you to just drop the CPU, based\non a marking that;s on the socket itself.\n\n97\n00:04:56.957 --> 00:05:00.381\nAnd it´s also a marking on the CPU,\ntells you how to align it, so\n\n98\n00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:04.750\nyou don´t install it wrong, cuz that\nwould definitely cause pin bending.\n\n99\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.500\nAnd you could literally just drop that in\nthere and just shimmy it a little bit, and\n\n100\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.280\nyou´ll feel it drop into place.\n\n101\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.730\nAnd then you take this latch,\nand you push it down.\n\n102\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.166\nAnd you'll notice it moves it forward,\nand those pins, they get grabbed onto.\n\n103\n00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:21.905\nThis is what's known as a ZIF socket,\nand it's been what we've used for\n\n104\n00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.020\na very long time now.\n\n105\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.420\nIt's called zero insertion force socket.\n\n106\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.158\nSo I want you to know, the ZIF socket\nis the one that essentially will\n\n107\n00:05:30.158 --> 00:05:33.080\nprotect you from things like chip creep.\n\n108\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.310\nAgain, basically,\nthe CPU walking out of its socket.\n\n109\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.090\nAnd it also helps to prevent pen bending.\n\n110\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.510\nNow, in the AMD world,\nAdvanced Micro Devices,\n\n111\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.070\nAMD is the two major CPU manufacturers\nright now, and have been for\n\n112\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.750\na long time,\nthey're the ones that adopted the PGA.\n\n113\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.840\nBut Intel, they went a different route,\nthey went with something known as an LGA,\n\n114\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.710\nand they still do today.\n\n115\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.010\nThey have for a long time, gone with\nwhat is known as a land grid array.\n\n116\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.170\nNow, I've got a picture, because a land\ngrid array is considerably different here.\n\n117\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.530\nIn a land grid array you're gonna notice\nthat the electrical contacts that are in\n\n118\n00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.760\nthe socket, they're like a bed of nails.\n\n119\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.015\nSo it's the electrical contacts here are\nactually kinda pins that are facing up.\n\n120\n00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:23.688\nAnd what we do, is we essentially\nstill have that same little lever,\n\n121\n00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.550\nyou'll see it latch.\n\n122\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.370\nAnd that latch folds down on top of\nthe CPU, and then you pull this lever.\n\n123\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.090\nAnd what it does is,\nit takes the surface of that latch,\n\n124\n00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.520\nor the surface of the closing point there,\nand it presses it down.\n\n125\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.104\nNow on the bottom of an Intel based CPU,\nyou just have these flat contacts.\n\n126\n00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:46.737\nAnd the electrical contact\nis made with the pins,\n\n127\n00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:51.840\nthe grid array here that\nis down in the CPU itself.\n\n128\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.760\nA little bit more alphabet soup here,\nbut you want\n\n129\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.720\nto know the two major types of CPU sockets\nthat you can find on motherboards, and\n\n130\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.330\nthey really are vendor specific.\n\n131\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.070\nWhen we talk about CompTIA+ and\na lot of the other CompTIA exams,\n\n132\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.330\nwe talk about vendor neutrality.\n\n133\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.941\nThis is not a vendor neutrality, one went\none way, the other one went the other way.\n\n134\n00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:14.552\nIntel, they stick with the land\ngrid array, the AMD sockets,\n\n135\n00:07:14.552 --> 00:07:17.170\nthey're gonna be the PGA sockets.\n\n136\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.910\nSo, know those two different types,\nand know what their differences are.\n\n137\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.700\nCuz you don't know,\nthey might give you an exam question that\n\n138\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.810\nmaybe gives you a picture and\nsays, what type of socket is this?\n\n139\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.100\nAnd you're gonna have to know that, and\n\n140\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.490\nknow that they're specific\nto each manufacturer.\n\n141\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.851\n&gt;&gt; Very good, but performance wise\nthere's no real big difference.\n\n142\n00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.930\nIt's just how does the processor actually\nmake contact with the motherboard.\n\n143\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.050\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's really how\nthe processor makes contact.\n\n144\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.845\nAnd then we get into the whole\nIntel versus AMD, and\n\n145\n00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:46.188\nI don't know if we want\nto go down that one.\n\n146\n00:07:46.188 --> 00:07:49.468\nBecause some people like and\nare very product,\n\n147\n00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:53.661\nI don't know, they like Intel and\nsome people swear by AMD.\n\n148\n00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.741\nSo ultimately Mike, I would say no,\nit's not really a performance thing,\n\n149\n00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.818\nit's like you said it, it's just how\nthey make the electrical contact with\n\n150\n00:07:59.818 --> 00:08:01.440\nthe motherboard and the CPU itself.\n\n151\n00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.720\nVery good.\n\n152\n00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.860\nAll right now, the next thing I wanna talk\nabout is something that you don't really\n\n153\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.300\nsee on these boards at all.\n\n154\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.130\nAnd that's something\nknown as a reset button.\n\n155\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.600\nAnd a rest button,\nyou find it a lot on the newer boards.\n\n156\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.570\nYou can find too that this is also part of\n\n157\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.100\nthe case itself,\nit depends on where it's located.\n\n158\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.650\nA lot of the times you'll\nhave two of these switches.\n\n159\n00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.990\nThe ability to recycle the power all\nthe way, and restart the machine,\n\n160\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.790\nwithout having to hardboot\nthe entire machine.\n\n161\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.600\nAnd, that's something\nknown as the reset button.\n\n162\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.430\nSometimes you can push that\non the front of a case.\n\n163\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.560\nYou'll see a little,\nsmall button that you can reset.\n\n164\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.900\nBut, a lot of these motherboards actually,\nhave a button right on the motherboard\n\n165\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.130\nitself, that you can push and\nit restarts the system.\n\n166\n00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.000\nThat's called the reset button.\n\n167\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.490\nIt might be something that\nyou have on the mother board.\n\n168\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.650\nI know mine's got that.\n\n169\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:53.450\nI've got a gigabyte ASUS, not ASUS but\na gigabyte type board and its got that.\n\n170\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.030\nBut these here, they don't.\n\n171\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.730\nI can't actually show you that.\n\n172\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.870\nKeep in mind,\nit could also be on the case as well.\n\n173\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.260\nSo, what else do we have\nconnected to the motherboard?\n\n174\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.110\nWell, we got a lot of stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.220\nThe next thing that we're\ngonna talk about, and\n\n176\n00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.850\nthey call out on the exam objectives,\nare fan connectors.\n\n177\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.220\nAnd there are a couple of different\ntypes of fan connectors and\n\n178\n00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.610\nI want to kind of mention them here.\n\n179\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.890\nOne that is on the motherboard,\none that is not.\n\n180\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.502\nAnd I want you to know the difference in\nwhy you might use one over the other.\n\n181\n00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:27.050\nAll right, I've got a couple of fans here\nthat we have set to the side here, and if\n\n182\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.860\nwe could take a look at them, you've got\na couple of different connectors, right?\n\n183\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.760\nYou'll see in our hard drive section that\nwe talk about the old traditional molex\n\n184\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.450\nconnectors, and these go back to\nthe days of like the early days,\n\n185\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.540\nof like the parallel ATA connectors,\nthe old hard drives right?.\n\n186\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.564\nWell, they're still used inside\nof your computing environment,\n\n187\n00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:48.280\nbecause what they do is,\nthey connect to these system fans.\n\n188\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.850\nNow, the good thing about this is,\nyou can take a single power plug, coming\n\n189\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.540\noff your power supply unit, and you can\ndaisy-chain a lot of these on there okay.\n\n190\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.900\nBut there's a limiting factor to these.\n\n191\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.670\nA lot of times is what you don't\nget is variable speed, and\n\n192\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.720\nyou don't get some of the monitoring,\nand, not diagnostic.\n\n193\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.480\nI guess more monitoring than anything.\n\n194\n00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480\nThat we talked about in our bio section.\n\n195\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.020\nTo do that what you need\nto have is one of these.\n\n196\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.650\nThey're still a Molex connector but\nthey've got a funny name.\n\n197\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.260\nIt's Molex KK.\n\n198\n00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.240\nI don't want you to worry about that.\n\n199\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.370\nIt's just a family,\na style of connectors, and\n\n200\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.615\nthey can, now they can be all different\ntypes of connectors but primarily what you\n\n201\n00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:30.205\nsee inside of your computing environment\nis a three pin or a four pin.\n\n202\n00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:33.585\nIf it's a three pin then what it\nmeans is you can't really monitor it.\n\n203\n00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:35.865\nYou'll have your positive,\nyou'll have your negative, and\n\n204\n00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:37.825\nthen I believe you'll\nhave your ground here.\n\n205\n00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:41.065\nIf you see a four pin,\nthen what that means, same thing,\n\n206\n00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:42.555\nyou've got your positive,\nnegative, and ground,\n\n207\n00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:45.565\nbut then you have a fourth pin for\nthings like monitoring.\n\n208\n00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:50.650\nAnd they usually plug in you'll see, well\nthis one's completely different here, but\n\n209\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.660\nyou'll usually see a little header on the\nmotherboard that we can plug these into.\n\n210\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.600\nNow it's important to understand\nthat when you plug the system fan,\n\n211\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.860\nwell this is the CPU fan,\nthese are called system fans.\n\n212\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.280\nWhen you plug these into the motherboard,\nthis gives the motherboard the ability to\n\n213\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.050\nsay, okay, if I've got a thermal\ntemperature sensor that's basically\n\n214\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.190\ntelling you what the heat is,\ndetecting what the heat is.\n\n215\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.090\nIf I see that heat rise and\nthe temperatures start to go up, with that\n\n216\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.530\nfourth pin, it can send a little bit more\nelectrical current, not only monitoring\n\n217\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.990\nit, but send a little more electric\ncurrent to ramp up the RPMs on the CPU.\n\n218\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.840\nAnd again,\nyou can find them all over the place.\n\n219\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.320\nLet's see if I can find\none on this motherboard.\n\n220\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.720\nSometimes, they're hard to find.\n\n221\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.490\nAnd you know what, I am not seeing one.\n\n222\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.240\nThere's a CPU fan and that's actually\nyou can see the four pin right there and\n\n223\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.770\nthat's kinda hard to see.\n\n224\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.250\nBut that's a little four\npin Molex connector.\n\n225\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:52.420\nAnd again gives it the ability that if it\ndetects that there's a lot of heat and\n\n226\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.190\nit maybe needs to increase the cooling,\nif you will, it will ramp up\n\n227\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.720\nthe RPM's within the system unit itself,\nbasically assisting the cooling.\n\n228\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.700\nThere's one, here we go,\nhere's a system fan header right here.\n\n229\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.890\nIt's kinda hard to see but\nyou can see SYS_FAN there for\n\n230\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.820\nsystem fan, so what we would do is\nwe would take one of these here and\n\n231\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.880\nwe would just plug it right into here.\n\n232\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.460\nAnd there we go we've installed one of the\nsystem fans and then what the system fan\n\n233\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.440\ndoes is it typically sits in the case and\nit pulls cool air inside of the case.\n\n234\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.920\nWell, depending on how you\nhave your case set up.\n\n235\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.990\nSomething these can be a push mechanism.\n\n236\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.860\nSometimes they can be\nan exhaust mechanism.\n\n237\n00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.610\nSo basically based on what\nyour case might support.\n\n238\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.850\nSo those are something to keep in mind as\nwell, again, if they're integrated into\n\n239\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.100\nthe motherboard the big thing with those\nthat I want you to take away from this is\n\n240\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.700\nthe fact that the motherboard itself,\nit can detect the RPMs.\n\n241\n00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.166\nYou could even see in the monitoring\nsoftware in your bios,\n\n242\n00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:52.880\nthat it'll tell you\nthe RPM's it's running.\n\n243\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.100\nI know mine does that it says okay well\nmy CPU fan is running at 2,900 RPM's and\n\n244\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.190\nit sees the heat start to rise,\nI've seen where I've gone in there and\n\n245\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.180\nits like 4,0000 RPM's and I'm like well I\nthink it's time to blow the dust out of\n\n246\n00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.300\nthis case because the cooling system's\nhaving to work really hard, so\n\n247\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.100\nit does variable speed and it also gives\nthe motherboard a chance to give you\n\n248\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:19.530\na little bit information back on\nthe current status of that fan as well.\n\n249\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.360\nThe other thing that's\nreally great about these two\n\n250\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.643\nis it detects system failure, right?\n\n251\n00:13:23.643 --> 00:13:27.000\nExcuse me, fan failure.\nYou could see it a lot of times that it\n\n252\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.100\nmight even throw a warning.\n\n253\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.770\nIf in your BIOS,\nsometimes BIOS or UEFI platforms,\n\n254\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.730\nthey support fan failure warnings.\n\n255\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.750\nBe careful with that [LAUGH]\nbecause when a fan fails,\n\n256\n00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.950\nyou're gonna get warned, all right.\n\n257\n00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:13:39.678 --> 00:13:41.433\n&gt;&gt; Tell your neighbors next to you.\n\n259\n00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:44.201\nIt basically gives off\nthis high-pitched alarm.\n\n260\n00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:49.300\nSo [LAUGH] I made the mistake I have\nquite a few system fan headers.\n\n261\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.080\nYou might call those,\nthe connectors on the motherboard,\n\n262\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.560\nyou might hear them called headers.\n\n263\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.650\nAnd what I did is I turned the alarm on\nbut I didn't connect one of the fans.\n\n264\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.440\nSo it thought it was a failure and\nthe moment I turned the computer on.\n\n265\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.610\nSo, you might not wanna turn that\nalarm on if you're not gonna populate.\n\n266\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.630\nAnd what that means, again,\n\n267\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.900\njargon for installing all the system\nfans across the motherboard itself.\n\n268\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.010\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n269\n00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:17.010\n&gt;&gt; So the next thing, we've got\nwhat are known as front panel and\n\n270\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.740\ntop panel connectors that we need to\nlook at inside of our motherboard.\n\n271\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:29.380\nThis is an interesting concept because\nwhat is a front and top panel connector?\n\n272\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.300\nMike I don't know about you.\n\n273\n00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.090\nDo you see any panels on\nthis motherboard anywhere?\n\n274\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.740\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say, you know Wes,\nmy case at home has some connectors on\n\n275\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.640\nthe front, but I don't see how they're\ngoing to get to the motherboard.\n\n276\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n277\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.320\nThe front panel and top panel,\nI want you to think of, for instance.\n\n278\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.830\nI want you to think of your case.\n\n279\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.570\nThis really relates to your case, and the\nconnections that your case, your tower,\n\n280\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.060\nthe exoskeleton of the system unit\nmake to the motherboard itself.\n\n281\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.980\nAnd in fact let's see here, this one,\nokay, we got this right here,\n\n282\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.740\nlet me turn this around a little bit,\ndid I get that in the camera there?\n\n283\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.880\nIt's over here, yeah.\n\n284\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.720\nThere we go.\n\n285\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.810\nSo it doesn't look that glorious, right,\n\n286\n00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.820\nit's just a little small\nconnector right here, right.\n\n287\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.680\nAnd you can see a series of pins.\n\n288\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.820\nNow I will tell you that every\none of these are kind of\n\n289\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.440\nunique to each case that you have.\n\n290\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.340\nAnd on the front of your case you\nmight have seen things like a hard\n\n291\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.650\ndrive activity light, right?\n\n292\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.800\nWhen you turn on your computer,\nyou see the little red or green or\n\n293\n00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.280\nblue, whatever the color might be.\n\n294\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.580\nAnd you can see that light flickering on\nand off, that's a drive activity light\n\n295\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.080\nindicator it lets you know that the hard\ndrive's running or maybe it's red and\n\n296\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.870\nthat tells you something's bad maybe\nthe hard drive isn't running you got more\n\n297\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.410\nproblems than you know.\n\n298\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.060\nBut it can also do things\nlike the power light.\n\n299\n00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.923\nWhen you push the power on the front of\nyour computer that light a lot of times,\n\n300\n00:15:46.923 --> 00:15:49.896\nyou'll have a light in that\npower button that comes on, and\n\n301\n00:15:49.896 --> 00:15:52.473\nit lets you know,\nhey we got power to the computer.\n\n302\n00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:56.359\nIt also connects to things like your\naudio, and if you've got those little what\n\n303\n00:15:56.359 --> 00:16:00.187\nare they the one-eighth inch 3.5 mm TRS\njacks, the audio jacks in the front\n\n304\n00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:03.530\nof the case that I plug my headphones or\na microphone into.\n\n305\n00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.960\nWell, that's where you connect\nthose connections from the case to\n\n306\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.350\nthe motherboard, and it allows you to use\nthose headphones and those microphones.\n\n307\n00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.200\nCould be USB, all right?\n\n308\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.250\nNow on the motherboard here itself,\nlet's be careful.\n\n309\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.330\nLet me show you this\nmotherboard again down here.\n\n310\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.430\nNotice that we have some USB connectors\nthat are on the back of this motherboard\n\n311\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.540\nand a stack of them right here.\n\n312\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.840\nWell those are integrated, right?\n\n313\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.120\nThat's the IO ports and\n\n314\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.210\nthey're integrated into the functionality\nof the motherboard itself.\n\n315\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.870\nHowever, a lot of times, and\nmost of the times your towers,\n\n316\n00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.790\nyour cases will have their\nown USB ports in them.\n\n317\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:40.320\nAnd if you look on the inside of that\ncase along with the front panel headers,\n\n318\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.690\ntypically this is a separate wire so\nwe have to be careful.\n\n319\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.520\nA lot of times you might not even\nsee that in the front panel headers,\n\n320\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.370\nthat it's a completely separate cable.\n\n321\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.680\nThat same concept that basically\nplugs into the motherboard and\n\n322\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.350\nallows you to use the USB ports that\nare integrated into the case versus\n\n323\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.970\nthe ones that are integrated\ninto the motherboard.\n\n324\n00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.200\nAll right, so let me see,\nmake sure I didn't miss anything here.\n\n325\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.604\nUSB, we've got the power button and\nthe power light,\n\n326\n00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:04.129\ndrive activity light indicator.\n\n327\n00:17:04.129 --> 00:17:08.012\nAnd again it flickers on and off to let\nyou know the hard drives running or\n\n328\n00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:10.031\nlack thereof, [LAUGH] as well as USB.\n\n329\n00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:12.908\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we really have to look at\n\n330\n00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:16.810\noverall when it comes to the major\ncomponents within the motherboard itself.\n\n331\n00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:20.630\nAll right, now we got the fun stuff,\nMike, [LAUGH] all right?\n\n332\n00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.800\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking forward to.\n\n333\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we've been talking\nabout a lot of the components and\n\n334\n00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:32.380\nwhat we're trying to do is basically\nshow you what these components are.\n\n335\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.720\nAnd really when it comes down to it, those\nare the majority of the major components\n\n336\n00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.780\nthat you might interact\nwith on a motherboard.\n\n337\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.300\nSome of the integrated components that\nyou can see, the little transistors and\n\n338\n00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.400\nstuff, not really anything you have\nto worry about for the A+ exam.\n\n339\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.180\nHowever, there are some things that you\ndo have to worry about the A+ exam, and\n\n340\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.660\nthose are known as form factors.\n\n341\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.452\nNow Mike, you asked the question earlier,\nsaid form factors, you know we get size\n\n342\n00:17:55.452 --> 00:17:58.539\nand shape, and we talked about\nthose being the characteristics and\n\n343\n00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:00.726\nthe arrangement of the mother boards,\nright?\n\n344\n00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:02.806\nThis is about standardization, all right?\n\n345\n00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:05.321\nIn the earlier days of computing,\nand networking, and\n\n346\n00:18:05.321 --> 00:18:07.195\nI know you're a network administrator so\n\n347\n00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:11.160\nI know you understand this well, everybody\nwanted to do everything their own way.\n\n348\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody had the latest and\n\n349\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.310\ngreatest technology,\n\n350\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.730\nbut the problem is you would get into\nsomething known as vendorlocked, right?\n\n351\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.050\nVendorlocked, it wasn't vendor\ndiversity that we have today.\n\n352\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.370\nA lot of times if you're just getting into\ncomputing you don't really realize this,\n\n353\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.492\nbut there was a point in time\nthat Atari was making computers.\n\n354\n00:18:26.492 --> 00:18:29.642\nI think Toshiba was making computers,\nCommodore, and, wow,\n\n355\n00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:30.935\nthat's an old one there.\n\n356\n00:18:30.935 --> 00:18:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n357\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.200\n&gt;&gt; But everybody was making computers, and\n\n358\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.210\nthey were all making it\na little bit different.\n\n359\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.820\nAnd if you bought their computer,\nguess what?\n\n360\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.470\nYou'd have to buy all\ntheir components too.\n\n361\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.740\nBecause their components wouldn't fit\nin another manufacturer's components.\n\n362\n00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.640\nSo IBM, and again, IBM has basically\nled the way on a lot of things that\n\n363\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.440\nhave been standardized\nlater down the road, right?\n\n364\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.730\nIBM said, okay, well we're gonna\nrelease what's known as a standard or\n\n365\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.890\na specification.\n\n366\n00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.310\nWhy do we want standardization?\n\n367\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.250\nBefore we even get into\nthe forum factor sizes, right?\n\n368\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.160\nStandardization provides consistency,\nall right?\n\n369\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.028\nNot only does it provide consistency,\nit provides inter-operability.\n\n370\n00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:09.497\nAnd one of the great things is\nit allows you, as the consumer,\n\n371\n00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:13.200\nto make a choice that says, hey,\nI can get an ASUS motherboard.\n\n372\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.500\nI can get a gigabyte motherboard.\n\n373\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.830\nBut then I can go to NVIDIA\nif I want a video card or\n\n374\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.700\nI could go to ATI and\nI could get a video card.\n\n375\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.630\nIf I need a network adapter,\nI could choose Intel, right?\n\n376\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.000\nI might not even have an Intel board and\nthat's gonna throw you for a loop.\n\n377\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.280\nI might have an AMD board that I can\nput an Intel network adapter in.\n\n378\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.600\nMaybe I don't like Intel.\n\n379\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.630\nWell, that's okay,\nI can get a Broadcom network adapter.\n\n380\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.440\nYou have choices and you have this\ninter-operability and if they're\n\n381\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.320\nfollowing the standards you know what\nto expect when you open the case.\n\n382\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.721\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings about standardization and\n\n383\n00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:49.510\nit's why it's important here on the exam.\n\n384\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.120\nSo we're gonna talk about some of\nthose form factors right here.\n\n385\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.810\n&gt;&gt; Actually, Wes, we're not.\n\n386\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.350\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n387\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.410\nWe are gonna go over them.\n\n388\n00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.705\nBut unfortunately, we are out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n389\n00:20:00.705 --> 00:20:02.060\nSo we're gonna leave\nyou with a cliffhanger.\n\n390\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.900\nWe're gonna talk about those\ndifferent form factors in part three.\n\n391\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.523\nSo thank you for that, Wes.\n\n392\n00:20:06.523 --> 00:20:09.120\nAnything you want to add\nbefore we close this one out?\n\n393\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.847\n&gt;&gt; No, access denied.\n\n394\n00:20:09.847 --> 00:20:11.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apparently,\n\n395\n00:20:11.493 --> 00:20:15.070\nwe gotta leave you with that cliffhanger,\nbut we will see you in that third part.\n\n396\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.610\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n397\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.990\nAll right,\nwell thanks everybody for joining,\n\n398\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.740\nhope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n399\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.510\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n400\n00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n401\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:30.477\n[MUSIC]\n\n402\n00:20:30.477 --> 00:20:33.380\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.230\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.562\nAnd today we're doing our CompTIA A+ 901.\n\n6\n00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:24.500\nAnd in this episode, we're actually\npicking back up, this is a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.690\nSo if you missed part one or two, make\nsure you go back and watch those first,\n\n8\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.890\nbut there is a part three and\n\n9\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.775\nwe kinda left you with cliff\nhanger at the end of part two.\n\n10\n00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:36.420\nWe talked about a lot of the different\ncomponents that we find on a motherboard.\n\n11\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.820\nNow, we wanna talk about the difference\nsizes of these motherboards or\n\n12\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.110\ntheir form factors.\n\n13\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.620\nAnd here to close in is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.330\nWelcome back, Wes.\n\n15\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.690\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike, thanks for having me back.\n\n16\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.865\nThat's right, and\nhe cut me off in that last episode, right?\n\n17\n00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna see why here,\n\n18\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.210\nbecause we've really saved more\nof the technical details for\n\n19\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.030\nthe end of this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.420\nWell, or I should say mini series\nthat we're working on here.\n\n21\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.200\nWe've talked about the various components,\nlike Mike said,\n\n22\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.730\nthat you can find within the motherboard.\n\n23\n00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.280\nWe really just wanted to establish what is\nthis thing and what is it doing for us.\n\n24\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.298\nAnd that is gonna be definitely very\nimportant information, but you have to\n\n25\n00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:16.061\nknow in the A+ exam but there is also\ngonna be some stuff that is more like\n\n26\n00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:20.180\npush ups or sit ups and anybody can look\nat me you can tell I don't like sit ups.\n\n27\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.215\nAnd it is some more of the stuff\nthat you just really have to,\n\n28\n00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:29.139\nyou just have to grab the mental handle\nand hold on for because remember,\n\n29\n00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.790\none of the last things we\nsaid in that last part there.\n\n30\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.680\nWe said, specification standards are,\nthey promote interoperability.\n\n31\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.110\nYou don't have to get vendor locked,\nyou have choices as a consumer.\n\n32\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.920\nAnd that's a great thing to have,\nto be able to say,\n\n33\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620\nI know what this component is.\n\n34\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.800\nNow I just have to figure out, who do I\nlike as a manufacturer, who do I feel,\n\n35\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.430\nas the consume, makes a better product?\n\n36\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.360\nBut, there are some things that\nthe standards that we're gonna talk about,\n\n37\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.761\nwhen it comes to motherboards, that you're\nreally gonna have to know for the exam.\n\n38\n00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:06.100\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\nI've got a little diagram here and\n\n39\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.140\nlet's start with some of these standards.\n\n40\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.560\nNow when we talk about standards\nyou might notice if you've looked\n\n41\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.020\nat the 901 objectives, they call out size.\n\n42\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.060\nI'm gonna tell you honestly I'm a little\nbit cautious with that term size.\n\n43\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.340\nI think it would be better like\nwe've talked about Mike and\n\n44\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.690\nI already, form factor.\n\n45\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.390\nForm factor isn't just about\nthe size of a motherboard,\n\n46\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.350\nit's a lot of things\nabout the motherboard.\n\n47\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.080\nSize is definitely one of those things but\nform factor also\n\n48\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.900\ndenotes the characteristics of\na motherboard, how are the components?\n\n49\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.750\nWhat's unique about this board, and\n\n50\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.736\nagain if you're following a form factor,\nthere's a standard that you have.\n\n51\n00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:51.540\nNow, with these form factors, I do want\nyou to understand in any PC build,\n\n52\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.000\nin any computer build, there are three\nform factors that have to match.\n\n53\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.560\nThere's no way around it.\n\n54\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.240\nThe case itself, the motherboard and\nthe power supply.\n\n55\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.100\nThose are the three form factors that all\ntypically fall under a single standard.\n\n56\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.970\nSo for instance, I'll have an ATX case,\ntower if you will.\n\n57\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.960\nI'll have ATX motherboard, and\nI'll have an ATX power supply.\n\n58\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.080\nThose three things absolutely have\nto match when you're building\n\n59\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.970\nyour next computer or\nwhen you're maybe replacing a component.\n\n60\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.670\nMike comes in and says and I know you\ncould do this by yourself Mike but\n\n61\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.310\nMike says hey, Wes,\nI need a new power supply.\n\n62\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.910\nWell the first thing you'll have to do as\nan A+ technician is say all right Mike,\n\n63\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.850\nwhat standard do you have?\n\n64\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.800\nI know Mike knows, but maybe your\nconsumers don't know what the standard is\n\n65\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.650\nand that's up to you to\nmake that determination.\n\n66\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.740\nSo let's go ahead and let's talk about\nthe one that has been around for\n\n67\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.200\na very long time and pretty much\ncornered the market as really, just most\n\n68\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.350\nwidely adopted motherboard form factor\nthere is and that's known as the ATX.\n\n69\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.690\nNow, when I say it's been around for\n\n70\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.798\na long time, Intel came out\nwith this form factor in 1995.\n\n71\n00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:05.660\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; It was the replacement for\n\n72\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.100\nthe earlier AT.\n\n73\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.230\nNow, I'm gonna mention just briefly,\nyou don't have to know these for\n\n74\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.850\nthe A+ exam but\nI've always thought as an instructor,\n\n75\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.732\nit's good to know where we've come\nfrom and where we've progressed to.\n\n76\n00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:17.810\nTo maybe,\nsee a little about the future and\n\n77\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.054\nI'll tell you what, if I knew all of\nthat I would be winning a lottery.\n\n78\n00:04:21.054 --> 00:04:21.974\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n79\n00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:26.480\nthe very first PC form factor\nthat came was called IBM PC.\n\n80\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.672\nIt was probably as big\nas 50 inch screen TV,\n\n81\n00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:34.041\nnot really but, the next one that\ncame out was known as the XT.\n\n82\n00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.220\nNow the one that stood the test of time\nfor a little bit was called the AT.\n\n83\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.730\nIt was called Advanced Technology.\n\n84\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.054\nThat one actually came out and\nstood the test of time up until 1995.\n\n85\n00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:50.520\nAnd in 1995 they came out with\nthe Advanced Technology Extended.\n\n86\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.390\nIt was the one that replaced\nthe earlier AT boards.\n\n87\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.520\nNow, with the AT boards, I want you to\nmake sure that you jot these down and\n\n88\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.030\ncommit them to memory for your A+ exam.\n\n89\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.500\nIt's not the fun stuff, but it will\nhelp you pass the certification exam.\n\n90\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.370\nATX is a 12 inch by 9.6 inch motherboard.\n\n91\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.370\nAnd this is why you could probably\nstart to see case is important.\n\n92\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.860\nCuz if I have an ATX case,\n\n93\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.830\nit has notches in that case where I\ncan align the ATX motherboard to it.\n\n94\n00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.730\nAnd then I can screw the ATX board to\nthe side of the case when you're making or\n\n95\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.480\nbuilding your PC.\n\n96\n00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.420\nNow I will tell you as just a brief side\nnote, a lot of these cases today have\n\n97\n00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.130\nmultiple positioning points just in case,\nmaking it a little bit more versatile.\n\n98\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.210\nBut you still have to know,\nit must support at least the ATX standard,\n\n99\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.280\nregardless of what other standards it has,\nif you have an ATX board.\n\n100\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.870\nBecause the mounting points are consistent\nwith the dimensions of the board itself.\n\n101\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.350\nAnd the other thing I\nwant you to know here is,\n\n102\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.750\none of the things that the ATX\nboard brought is a major,\n\n103\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.090\nI guess divergence, from the earlier\ninput standards that we had.\n\n104\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.000\nIn the AT boards, in those days,\n\n105\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.580\nin fact if we can take a look here at\nthis motherboard right here that I have.\n\n106\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.610\nIn the earlier AT boards,\nyou had a single keyboard connector, and\n\n107\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.140\nthat was called an AT dean.\n\n108\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.230\nIt was an AT DIN connector, in fact\nwe still use it today, it's used in\n\n109\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.410\naudio communications now, it's not\nused in input devices for keyboards.\n\n110\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.690\nAnd if you had a mouse on that day,\nyou had a serial mouse.\n\n111\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.710\nAnd you would plug it in this way.\n\n112\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.190\nWell, that wasn't really convenient, so\n\n113\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.420\nwhat the ATX standard\nbrought in is the PS2 port.\n\n114\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.780\nNow, I know what you gamers are thinking\nout there, sorry guys and gals out there,\n\n115\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.060\nwe're not talking about the PlayStation 2,\n\n116\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.960\nwhat we're talking about\nis Personal System 2.\n\n117\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.300\nThis replaced the earlier what would\nbe known as the AT DIN connector,\n\n118\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.970\nwhich was a five pin DIN connector.\n\n119\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.020\nDIN just stands for the German Institute\nof Standards, it's just the German DIN,\n\n120\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.000\nthe German rendition of that or whatever.\n\n121\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.110\nThis is called a six pin mini-din, and you\ncan see this is for keyboard and mouse.\n\n122\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.420\nNow, I will tell you that the colors,\nthey don't really mean anything.\n\n123\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.135\nIn fact, some days today, for\ninstance, my I got a new board, and\n\n124\n00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.855\nit actually blends these two together.\n\n125\n00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:12.105\nSo keep in mind, the color codes\nare really just for us to know, and\n\n126\n00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:16.705\nit became kind of more of a de\nfacto than it did really a standard\n\n127\n00:07:16.705 --> 00:07:20.650\nto color code them, just so you know which\none's keyboard and which one's mouse.\n\n128\n00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.360\nThat's one of the big things that I\nwant you to know when it comes to\n\n129\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.170\nthe ATX standard.\n\n130\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.030\nNow the other thing that the ATX\nstandard did is it would rearrange,\n\n131\n00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.110\nfrom the earlier AT days, it would\nrearrange the CPU and rotate the whole\n\n132\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.790\nboard 90 degrees to put that CPU,\nif you ever looked inside your case,\n\n133\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.650\nthe CPU is sitting right\nunder the power supply.\n\n134\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.300\nAnd that's the fan of\nthe power supply can help\n\n135\n00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.340\nassist the overall cooling system\nwithin the machine itself.\n\n136\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.350\nNow there's some other\ngreat things that it did.\n\n137\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.864\nIn the earlier AT standard we\nhad what were known as a P8 and\n\n138\n00:07:54.864 --> 00:07:56.315\na P9 power connector.\n\n139\n00:07:56.315 --> 00:08:00.230\nAnd there was a problem, well could be\na problem with these, they were identical.\n\n140\n00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.236\nSo how do you arrange it, right?\n\n141\n00:08:02.236 --> 00:08:04.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had to know that black and\n\n142\n00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:07.500\nred together is how you would arrange\nthese, and you could reverse them.\n\n143\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.490\nAnd the thing about reversing\nthe polarity of your [LAUGH] power\n\n144\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.649\nsupply could cause all kinds of problems,\nshort circuits or damage, right?\n\n145\n00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:18.170\nSo they said, you know what,\nwe can't have that anymore.\n\n146\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.045\nLet's make it a little bit more convenient\nfor the PC technician to look right\n\n147\n00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:27.550\naway at a power connector and\nknow how to install it within the machine.\n\n148\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.192\nAll right, so\nlet me go ahead and show you.\n\n149\n00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:32.891\nOne of the other things that the ATX\nstandard brought in is this 20 pin\n\n150\n00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:34.000\nconnector.\n\n151\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.250\nAnd I know its kinda hard to see, but Mike\ncan you see that little notch right there?\n\n152\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.986\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n153\n00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:39.310\nthen you can see these keys, right?\n\n154\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.165\nThese specific shapes,\nthey call it notched keyed connector.\n\n155\n00:08:42.165 --> 00:08:46.185\nAnd we would know exactly how to\nput the clip from the power supply\n\n156\n00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:48.280\ncuz it would have the notch on it.\n\n157\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.746\nAnd then the power supply connector\nactually matches the notches that are in\n\n158\n00:08:52.746 --> 00:08:54.670\nthis 20 pin connector.\n\n159\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.820\nSo I want you to know that.\n\n160\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.730\nNow, the ATX standard has\ngone through many revisions.\n\n161\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.605\nBecause in the earlier days, we didn't\nneed a lot of power in our computing,\n\n162\n00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:06.540\nnot as much as we need today\nwith multi-core processing.\n\n163\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.127\nAnd a lot of other things\nthat are going on,\n\n164\n00:09:08.127 --> 00:09:10.300\nexpansion slots that we'll\ntalk about coming up here.\n\n165\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.250\nSo it has gone through its revisions,\nbut we have a power supply.\n\n166\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.980\nWe'll definitely talk about some of these\nrevisions that we want you to know.\n\n167\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.705\nBut that's the big thing\nthat I want you to know,\n\n168\n00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:22.510\nis that the ATX brought the 20\npin connector, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.420\nNow, that is one of the major things.\n\n170\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.877\nAnd while we're still here with these\nmotherboards, the other thing I wanna tell\n\n171\n00:09:28.877 --> 00:09:33.204\nyou is in the earlier days, if you wanted\nsome of the functionality that we could\n\n172\n00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:37.680\nget with all of these devices that we see\nhere, you had to get an expansion card.\n\n173\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.530\nLike we've talked about expansion cards,\nand if I wanted maybe another serial port.\n\n174\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.717\nIn those days, you can get a card\nthat was probably 15 inches long and\n\n175\n00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:48.105\nyou would install it into\na slot on the motherboard.\n\n176\n00:09:48.105 --> 00:09:51.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, when the ATX standard came out,\n\n177\n00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.730\nwhat they did is they integrated the IO\ninterface into the motherboard itself.\n\n178\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes,\nyou got three motherboards there,\n\n179\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.120\nall of which have these\nintegrated components back there.\n\n180\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.182\nAnd we're saying it's a standard, yet\n\n181\n00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:05.920\nthey don't really look like\nthey follow a standard.\n\n182\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.860\nAm I missing something here?\n\n183\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kinda interesting here.\n\n184\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.000\nWhat the ATX standard,\nlet me show you guys here.\n\n185\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.050\nWhat the ATX standard calls out\nis a rectangular pattern, right?\n\n186\n00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.100\nThe dimensions of a rectangle essentially.\n\n187\n00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.324\nAnd if I put these two different\nboards up here side by side,\n\n188\n00:10:20.324 --> 00:10:23.560\nyou'll notice that they're\nalmost the same width right?\n\n189\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.370\nLength and height if you will.\n\n190\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.831\nAnd that is because the ATX standard\nintegrates these components in and\n\n191\n00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:32.670\ncalls out the rectangular pattern, right?\n\n192\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.700\nThe dimensions of that rectangle.\n\n193\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.110\nBut what it doesn't call out Is what\nyou can put within the rectangle.\n\n194\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.070\nSo what it does is it gives\nthe manufacturers flexibility.\n\n195\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.418\nNot saying that hey, you have to\nhave a certain amount of ports here,\n\n196\n00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:48.910\nthese ports here, just that we're\ngonna have a rectangular pattern.\n\n197\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.244\nAnd you can decide if you want\nto have these ports here,\n\n198\n00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:54.940\nmaybe not even include\nsome of those ports.\n\n199\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.920\nSo It still gives you a standardization.\n\n200\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.872\nAnd Mike you and I were talking\nabout just before we even started\n\n201\n00:10:59.872 --> 00:11:02.881\nthis part three here about when\nyou look in the back of your case,\n\n202\n00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:04.900\nyou see that little rectangular pattern.\n\n203\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.203\nAnd if you're building your computer for\nthe first time,\n\n204\n00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:08.848\nit's just got a blanking plate, right?\n\n205\n00:11:08.848 --> 00:11:12.210\nA blanking plate is just a cover\nthat you're gonna pull out.\n\n206\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.740\nAnd one of the great things is if you\nan ATX standard, those blanking plates and\n\n207\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.150\nthat hollow frame there,\nthey're all gonna match.\n\n208\n00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.939\nAnd when you insert\nthe motherboard in the case,\n\n209\n00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:23.260\nthe rectangular pattern will match up.\n\n210\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.510\nBut it's probably gonna be the fact\nthat you're gonna have different ports,\n\n211\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.723\nif you will, cuz the manufacturers,\nit's up to them how they arrange them.\n\n212\n00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:30.503\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n213\n00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:36.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let me see if\nI missed anything here on that.\n\n214\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.390\nAgain, the I/Os,\nthey're integrated in the motherboard,\n\n215\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.580\nthat was one of the major things.\n\n216\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.640\nNow, I've also talked about the fact,\nif we could go back to the diagram here,\n\n217\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.170\nwe've got several different\nmotherboard form factors, right?\n\n218\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.450\nThe next one you're gonna\nsee is the Micro-ATX.\n\n219\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.180\nGuys and gals, let me not confuse you\nhere, this isn't the only ATX standard.\n\n220\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.583\nThere are many different revisions.\n\n221\n00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:02.765\nBut these are the only two primary ones\nthat you need to know for the A+ Exam.\n\n222\n00:12:02.765 --> 00:12:05.444\nNow the Micro-ATX, everything's the same.\n\n223\n00:12:05.444 --> 00:12:10.576\nEverything, as far as the arrangement, all\nof those specifications that I told you,\n\n224\n00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:13.250\nexcept for the dimensions of the board.\n\n225\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.660\nAnd that's one of the great things.\n\n226\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.690\nWhen you're studying for this exam,\nif you can remember one little set of\n\n227\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.810\nspecifications and it applies to more than\none thing, you're gonna save yourself some\n\n228\n00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.210\ntime in memorization when it comes to\nwhat you need to know for the exam.\n\n229\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.260\nSo the Micro-ATX,\nit would come out two years later, 1997.\n\n230\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.546\nAnd its a nine by six,\nactually nine by six, yeah,\n\n231\n00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:40.254\nlet me get this right,\n9.6 inches by 9.6 inches.\n\n232\n00:12:40.254 --> 00:12:42.281\nI'm having a hard time with English there.\n\n233\n00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:45.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we look, I've actually got a Micro,\n\n234\n00:12:45.169 --> 00:12:49.570\nactually no, this isn't a Micro-ATX,\nI take that back, this is an ITX board.\n\n235\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.660\nWe'll get into that one here in a second,\nbut this is the Mini-ITX.\n\n236\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.440\nThat'll come up next.\n\n237\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.760\nIt was a 9.6 inch by 9.6 inch board,\nright?\n\n238\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.570\nThe power supplies are the same.\n\n239\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.450\nI will tell you one of the micro\n\n240\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.530\nATX specifications is a maximum\nof four expansion slots.\n\n241\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.474\nThat's really the only difference is that\nbecause of its size, they said well,\n\n242\n00:13:14.474 --> 00:13:18.372\nwe'll give you a maximum, defined in\nthe standard, of four expansion slots.\n\n243\n00:13:18.372 --> 00:13:23.495\nSo, keep in mind that they're great for\nvery small form factor devices, like for\n\n244\n00:13:23.495 --> 00:13:28.960\ninstance if you're doing a home theater\nPC, right, they're great for that.\n\n245\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.720\nWe've had somebody else that I know that\ntook it and turned one into a firewall.\n\n246\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.882\nBut again, they have a limited\nexpandability because, again,\n\n247\n00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:37.270\nthey're smaller devices.\n\n248\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.970\nBut for the most part, the only thing\nthat changes is the dimensions and\n\n249\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.350\nreally that limiting factor,\nthe four expansion slots.\n\n250\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.800\nNow, on our diagram here,\nwe've got a couple more and\n\n251\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.120\nI could probably could've put ITX first.\n\n252\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.450\nAnd I just want you to know that the ITX\nstandard, it's the basis for ITX.\n\n253\n00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.030\nYou're not gonna go out there and\nfind an ITX board, all right?\n\n254\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.190\nIt forms the basis for\nall the other ITX standards, right?\n\n255\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.558\nIt's never formally released to the market\nuntil we came up with Mini-ITX, right?\n\n256\n00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:09.609\nThere's Mini-ITX, there's Nano-ITX,\nPico, and even Mobile today.\n\n257\n00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:12.990\nMobile-ITX is like\na credit card sized board.\n\n258\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.568\nSo you could just see smaller,\nsmaller boards, right?\n\n259\n00:14:15.568 --> 00:14:20.605\nWell the Mini-ITX board,\nit came out in 2001.\n\n260\n00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:25.813\nAnd that's the one that we have over here\nthat I kinda confuse with the Micro-ITX.\n\n261\n00:14:25.813 --> 00:14:30.762\nThe Mini-ITX is 6.7 inches by 6.7 inches,\nright?\n\n262\n00:14:30.762 --> 00:14:33.889\nThe original design did\na passive cooling system,\n\n263\n00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:37.950\nwhich means they were completely fanless,\nand why is that?\n\n264\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.390\nBecause they were primarily\ndeveloped to have low powered,\n\n265\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.570\nlow heat CPUs in them, and\nthat's still the fact today.\n\n266\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.650\nBut with CPUs getting a lot more stronger,\nwe\n\n267\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.030\ncould still do a kind of a passive cooling\nwhere you might have just a heat sink, and\n\n268\n00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.860\nyou could even sink fans in them today.\n\n269\n00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.510\nTypically, with these you only\nsee a single expansion slot.\n\n270\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.712\nA lot of times what you're gonna\nsee is that the I/O functionality,\n\n271\n00:15:04.712 --> 00:15:08.140\nthe input/output, will be integrated\ndirectly in the motherboard itself.\n\n272\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.890\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n273\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:15.120\nYou'll see that compared to\nour more full-sized board,\n\n274\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.795\nyou have four RAM slots here.\n\n275\n00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:19.870\nNotice that this one only has two.\n\n276\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.660\nThat's a commonality here,\nall right, in these Mini-ITX boards.\n\n277\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.090\nAnd you can see the square pattern here.\n\n278\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.520\nYou can see that we have our I/Os.\n\n279\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.735\nAnd again, interestingly enough,\nguess what, the ITX,\n\n280\n00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:34.772\nMini-ITX standard follows\nthe ATX standard, right?\n\n281\n00:15:34.772 --> 00:15:39.830\nSo for the most part, the ITX standard\nisn't too far off the ATX standard.\n\n282\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.280\nBut the big thing here is it was for\nlow powered CPUs, right?\n\n283\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.370\nIn those home theater PC type builds,\nvery, very small footprint, right?\n\n284\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.099\nSomething that could fit in almost what\nyou would say is like a top set box for\n\n285\n00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:52.194\nyour cable company, right?\n\n286\n00:15:52.194 --> 00:15:53.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n287\n00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.455\n&gt;&gt; So very, very handy,\n\n288\n00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:57.703\nthat is another one that we\nwant you to be aware of, right?\n\n289\n00:15:57.703 --> 00:16:02.456\nSo those are some of the form factors when\nit comes to the motherboards themselves.\n\n290\n00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:05.944\nRemember, three form factors that\nmust match anytime you're gonna build\n\n291\n00:16:05.944 --> 00:16:06.503\na machine.\n\n292\n00:16:06.503 --> 00:16:08.920\nIt's gonna be your case, right?\n\n293\n00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.300\nIt's gonna be your motherboard.\n\n294\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.240\nIt's gonna be the power supply as well.\n\n295\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.775\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, great stuff there.\n\n296\n00:16:13.775 --> 00:16:16.330\nJust a wealth of knowledge when it\ncomes to the components we're gonna\n\n297\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.900\nfind in our PC.\n\n298\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.310\nWe've been focusing in on the motherboard,\nthe integrated components,\n\n299\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.412\nthe non-integrated components.\n\n300\n00:16:23.412 --> 00:16:24.325\nAnd we kinda round things\nup in this episode.\n\n301\n00:16:24.325 --> 00:16:26.278\nTalking about the motherboard themselves.\n\n302\n00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:31.259\nAnd the form factors and the standards\nthat we need to be aware of when we're\n\n303\n00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:36.100\nbuilding a PC, repairing a PC,\nas well as passing that A+ 901 exam.\n\n304\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.520\nSo we thank you for that, Wes.\n\n305\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.955\nAny parting words for our viewers?\n\n306\n00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:41.316\n&gt;&gt; Well, I do have a few other\nthings that I wanna talk about.\n\n307\n00:16:41.316 --> 00:16:45.140\nI do have something that they call out,\nand this is kinda interesting.\n\n308\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.812\nWe've been talking about expansion\nslots the whole entire time.\n\n309\n00:16:47.812 --> 00:16:52.047\nBut one of the things that we haven't\ndefined are those expansion slot\n\n310\n00:16:52.047 --> 00:16:54.110\nspecifications as well.\n\n311\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.360\nSo, that is something we kinda gotta cover\nhere, because you have to know, right?\n\n312\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.180\nWhen we talk about expansion slots,\nas you've seen, as Mike and I have talked,\n\n313\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.919\nthey're all different shapes and\nsizes, right?\n\n314\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.289\nSo how do we know what one does what,\nright?\n\n315\n00:17:07.289 --> 00:17:08.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n316\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.680\nthat's why I wanna take just a few\nmore minutes here just to talk\n\n317\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.810\nabout these expansion\nslots as we round up.\n\n318\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.445\nAnd unfortunately,\nwe don't get out of specifications and\n\n319\n00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:16.795\nstandards quite that easily.\n\n320\n00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:18.388\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nthat's right, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n321\n00:17:18.388 --> 00:17:21.066\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He tried to save\nyou a little bit of pain here.\n\n322\n00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:24.400\nBut we do have to talk a little\nbit about these expansion slots.\n\n323\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.320\nSo on the exam,\nthey call out a series of these, right?\n\n324\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.010\nAnd we've actually got these,\nI've got a little diagram up here.\n\n325\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.900\nSo if we could kinda look at that,\nwe have PCI, and look at this,\n\n326\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.620\nwe just got a whole slew of\nalphabet soup here, all right?\n\n327\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.220\nWell, the expansion slot has what's known,\nremember we talked about bus, right?\n\n328\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.960\nWell, that's a bus architecture, right?\n\n329\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.850\nThe expansion slot sits\non those traces and\n\n330\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.850\nthat bus architecture's\ngonna be important.\n\n331\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.800\nBecause remember,\nwe said interoperability,\n\n332\n00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.325\nit's interoperability if you're\nfollowing the same standard.\n\n333\n00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:58.260\n[LAUGH] So it is important to\nunderstand these standards.\n\n334\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.450\nNow the first one we have right here\nis called the peripheral component\n\n335\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:01.990\ninterconnect.\n\n336\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.600\nAnd this one's been around for\na very long time.\n\n337\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.650\nIt's almost considered legacy today.\n\n338\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.580\nWe still see it,\nwe still could potentially use it.\n\n339\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.970\nAnd this was developed\nback in 1992 by Intel and\n\n340\n00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.340\nthen later they handed this over\nto what was known as PCI-Sig.\n\n341\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.995\nThat's a special interest group that\nbasically oversees the PCI standard.\n\n342\n00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:25.607\nAll right, this is a 32-bit bus.\n\n343\n00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:30.662\nOr it could be 64-bit bus, which means\n32 bits wide going into the CPU.\n\n344\n00:18:30.662 --> 00:18:36.226\nI want you to remember that\neach one of these 32-bit buses,\n\n345\n00:18:36.226 --> 00:18:41.797\nagain, you could have two\n32-bit buses on a single board.\n\n346\n00:18:41.797 --> 00:18:45.984\nAnd each one of those buses\ncould have five cards.\n\n347\n00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:49.873\nSo you can get a total, believe it or\nnot, maximum the standard support,\n\n348\n00:18:49.873 --> 00:18:51.470\nis you can have ten PCI cards.\n\n349\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.680\nIf your board supported it, you can\nexpand out to ten cards, right, maximum.\n\n350\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.600\nAnd I want you to remember the bits.\n\n351\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.831\nIt's the width of those traces, right,\n\n352\n00:18:59.831 --> 00:19:04.311\nthat pathway that we talked about that\ngoes into the CPU, it's 32 bits, right?\n\n353\n00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:09.085\nOverall, it's really 64 bits, but there's\nkind of like a dividing line, if you will,\n\n354\n00:19:09.085 --> 00:19:10.511\nbetween the two 32 bits.\n\n355\n00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:14.853\nAnd each of the five cards\nsits on its own 32-bit bus.\n\n356\n00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:17.600\nNow, there were some\nlimiting factors to this.\n\n357\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.150\nIt was what's known as\na parallel interface.\n\n358\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:25.320\nAnd a parallel interface is one where we\nhave multiple adjacent copper conductors.\n\n359\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.647\nAnd the problem with that is you\nget what's known as crosstalk and\n\n360\n00:19:28.647 --> 00:19:30.108\nelectrical interference.\n\n361\n00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:34.428\nThink about if I'm sending electrical\nsignal down one of those conductors and\n\n362\n00:19:34.428 --> 00:19:35.680\nit kinda bleeds over.\n\n363\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.722\nIt interferes with the highway,\nif you will, that's next to it, right?\n\n364\n00:19:38.722 --> 00:19:43.440\nSo there was only so much power\nyou could put over a PCI interface\n\n365\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.370\nbefore it would cause crosstalk and\ninterference.\n\n366\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.330\nSo it was a little bit limiting.\n\n367\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.701\nI want you to remember some\nother specifics, all right?\n\n368\n00:19:52.701 --> 00:19:56.250\nStandard configuration was 33 megahertz,\nright?\n\n369\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.820\nA hert, if you will,\nis one clock cycle, if you will.\n\n370\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.660\nAnd we measured in how many\nclock cycles per second.\n\n371\n00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.679\nSo 33 clock cycles per second,\nif you will.\n\n372\n00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:09.240\nAnd again, I know a lot of standards guys,\nbut you can do this.\n\n373\n00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.881\nThe total speed was a 133 megabytes.\n\n374\n00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:17.710\nNow that being said, remember I talked\nabout the PCI Special Interest Group?\n\n375\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.765\nPCI Special Interest Group said,\nyou know what?\n\n376\n00:20:19.765 --> 00:20:21.601\nThis parallel interface,\n\n377\n00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:27.130\nwe're having kind of a problem with it\nbecause it is a shared bus topology.\n\n378\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.760\nAnd what that means is everyone,\n\n379\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.170\nall of those ten cards,\nwere communicating across the same path.\n\n380\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.430\n&gt;&gt; So to use the term you talked about\nin one of our previous episodes,\n\n381\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.990\nit starts becoming your bottleneck.\n\n382\n00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.077\n&gt;&gt; It certainly does.\n\n383\n00:20:38.077 --> 00:20:40.190\nIt uses what's known as bus mastery,\nright?\n\n384\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.820\nBecause think about maybe\na call that I'm on, right?\n\n385\n00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.639\nIf Mike and I are talking,\n\n386\n00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:52.606\nrather than butt into the conversation,\nonly between our two phones,\n\n387\n00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:57.602\npeople can't really butt into that\ncall and just interrupt that call.\n\n388\n00:20:57.602 --> 00:21:00.485\nSo, what these cards would\ndo is use bus mastering,\n\n389\n00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:04.823\nsince they're all using the same highway,\nI got ten cards who's gonna talk?\n\n390\n00:21:04.823 --> 00:21:06.108\nWell, they would use bus mastering.\n\n391\n00:21:06.108 --> 00:21:10.550\nAnd bus mastering just means that this\ncard would say, hey, I gotta talk.\n\n392\n00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.010\nEverybody else, you gotta be quiet, right?\n\n393\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.450\nSo again, limiting, right?\n\n394\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.340\nOne card talks, everybody stops.\n\n395\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.880\nThe other card talks, everybody stops.\n\n396\n00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.830\nSo I also want you to know bus mastering\nis the way that they would communicate.\n\n397\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.080\nSo PCI-SIG, the special interest group,\nsaid, that's not even efficient.\n\n398\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.538\nWe need all cards running at all\ntimes to get better performance.\n\n399\n00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:30.600\nAnd later on,\n\n400\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.530\nthey would come up with another interface\nthat we're gonna talk about in a second.\n\n401\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.340\nSo what they tried to do is between\ncoming up with a new technology, PCI,\n\n402\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.400\nthey could see was coming to\nthe end of its efficiency.\n\n403\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.321\nSo they said, hey, you know what?\n\n404\n00:21:43.321 --> 00:21:48.990\nHow about we take the dividing line\nout of those two 32-bit highways and\n\n405\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.740\nwe put them together one 64 bit.\n\n406\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.417\nAnd we stick a single slot across that\nentire 64 bit platform or trace, right?\n\n407\n00:21:56.417 --> 00:22:01.130\nThat would be what was known\nas PCI extended, all right?\n\n408\n00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.997\nThat's really all I want you\nto know about PCI extended.\n\n409\n00:22:02.997 --> 00:22:05.510\nIt wasn't highly adopted,\nit was really expensive.\n\n410\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.262\nWe've seen in server technology and\nit essentially says,\n\n411\n00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:11.687\nlet's take the dividing line out of\nthose two separate 32-bit buses.\n\n412\n00:22:11.687 --> 00:22:13.731\nWe'll slam them together with all 64 bits.\n\n413\n00:22:13.731 --> 00:22:15.988\nAnd we'll put a card\nacross the top of it and\n\n414\n00:22:15.988 --> 00:22:20.548\nwe'll increase the speeds up to about\n266 megabits per second, right?\n\n415\n00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:26.140\nAgain ,very expensive, only commonly\nseen inside of your server environments,\n\n416\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.170\nbut even that was still using\nthe parallel interface.\n\n417\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.310\nSo what they did is they came out\nwith the next generation interface,\n\n418\n00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.640\nwhich is really what we're using today,\nand that's PCIE.\n\n419\n00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.160\nPCIE is the peripheral component\ninterconnect express, and\n\n420\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.700\nit uses a serial interface.\n\n421\n00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.270\nAnd the serial interface\nis a set of sequential\n\n422\n00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.790\ninformation that's going back and\nforth across that bus.\n\n423\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.560\nAnd one of the great\nthings is it eliminates\n\n424\n00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.500\nsome of that crosstalk, if you will.\n\n425\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.160\nAnd when we put a lot more voltage,\nall we're doing\n\n426\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.490\nis increasing the communication\nacross that single interface.\n\n427\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:03.040\nSo it's a serial interface and\nit's a full point to point communication.\n\n428\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.833\nNow, there are some of the PCIE standards\nthat I wanna just briefly talk about\n\n429\n00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:11.757\ncuz it's gone through some\ndifferent revisions, all right?\n\n430\n00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:16.299\nPCIe1 version one, and\nlet me just stop here for a second and\n\n431\n00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:18.360\nlet me say one other thing.\n\n432\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.977\nOne of the great things about PCIe is now\nnot only can you have a single interface,\n\n433\n00:23:23.977 --> 00:23:25.060\na single path.\n\n434\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.283\nThey made it to where you\ncan actually stagger and\n\n435\n00:23:28.283 --> 00:23:31.280\nadd individual sequential communication.\n\n436\n00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.679\nSo even though it's not a parallel\ninterface, you've essentially said,\n\n437\n00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:38.196\nI got one pipeline, now I'm gonna add\nanother pipeline, another pipeline.\n\n438\n00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:40.767\nAnd eventually,\nall the way up to 16 of these, right?\n\n439\n00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:42.367\nYou might hear them called lanes, right?\n\n440\n00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:46.107\nSo you'll have one lane cards,\nwhich is exactly like it sounds,\n\n441\n00:23:46.107 --> 00:23:49.470\njust a single lane in and\nout across the motherboard.\n\n442\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.710\nYou might have four.\n\n443\n00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.710\nA four-lane card,\nwhich is four of those lanes wide.\n\n444\n00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.622\nEight, all the way up to sixteen.\n\n445\n00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:59.242\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, so really what we need\nto know is the speed of a single lane and\n\n446\n00:23:59.242 --> 00:24:00.931\nthen we can just multiply that out?\n\n447\n00:24:00.931 --> 00:24:02.666\nMakes it so much easier, doesn't it?\n\n448\n00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:03.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n449\n00:24:03.202 --> 00:24:04.358\n&gt;&gt; But that's absolutely the truth.\n\n450\n00:24:04.358 --> 00:24:08.670\nKeep in mind, like we've said, you have\na single serial lane, and it's just great\n\n451\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:13.070\nthat they allow you, in the design, that\nthey attach multiple lanes, easiest way.\n\n452\n00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.670\nSo, let's look at, there's really three\nPCIE standards that you have to know,\n\n453\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.400\nand just make it easy.\n\n454\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.850\nVersion one, version two,\nand version three.\n\n455\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.470\nAnd let's kind of run through the speeds\nthat you can see on the different lanes.\n\n456\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.670\nAnd really, when it comes down the exam,\nremember what Mike said.\n\n457\n00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.730\nThat's gonna make it easier for you,\ncuz if you can remember the single lanes,\n\n458\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.110\nyou don't have to remember four,\nfive, six different standards, right?\n\n459\n00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.130\nSo for instance, we have PCIE 1.0.\n\n460\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.200\nSingle lane transfer speed\nis 250 megabytes per second.\n\n461\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.590\nSo that means if I have a four lane card,\nmultiply it times four.\n\n462\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.250\nWe've got a gigabit.\n\n463\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.670\nIf I have an eight lane card,\nwell we have two gigabytes, not gigabits,\n\n464\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.640\ngigabytes, per second.\n\n465\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.400\nAnd then if I have, finally, the 16 lane,\nthat's gonna be 250 megabytes times 16.\n\n466\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.290\nThat gives me four\ngigabyte transfer speeds.\n\n467\n00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.370\nSo fairly easy once you know\nthat single lane speed.\n\n468\n00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.160\nNow, when we move in to 2.0 everything,\nthe single lane's speeds double.\n\n469\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.957\nAnd that's another thing that might make\nit easier for the study and stand point.\n\n470\n00:25:09.957 --> 00:25:15.144\n250 on a 1.0, we get into 2.0, single\nlane speed's gonna be 500 megabytes,\n\n471\n00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:17.474\nand then it's a multiplier after that.\n\n472\n00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:20.530\nWe have two gigabyte transfer speeds for\na four lane.\n\n473\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.310\nWe have four gigabytes for the eight lane.\n\n474\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.830\nAnd in the 16 lane,\nthat's pretty impressive,\n\n475\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.865\nbrings it all the way up to 8 gigabytes.\n\n476\n00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:30.669\nEight gigabytes for those point to\npoint serial based connections.\n\n477\n00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:35.100\nThen we also have 3.0 too, and\n3.0 has been more of the common standard.\n\n478\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.851\nMike and I were talking about this,\ncuz we're geeks.\n\n479\n00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:40.732\nThey got a four in draft right now,\nand as of 2017,\n\n480\n00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:42.910\nit should be released fairly soon.\n\n481\n00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.130\nBut I want you to know the 3.0.\n\n482\n00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.050\nSingle lane speed, four gigabytes.\n\n483\n00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.510\nNow it's a little off then that,\nit's 3.94, but\n\n484\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.425\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n485\n00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:55.000\nIn all the references that I've seen,\nif you're not getting really,\n\n486\n00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.430\nreally specific on it,\nno four gigabytes for the single lane.\n\n487\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.220\nMultiply that, and\nyou know what, let me back up.\n\n488\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.430\nIt's actually a gigabyte.\n\n489\n00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.110\nBecause I said every one's a double,\nand I'm gonna get my math wrong here.\n\n490\n00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.330\nAgain, the single lane\nspeed is a gigabyte.\n\n491\n00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:15.340\nAnd then that means the four\nlane is gonna be four gigabytes.\n\n492\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.395\nImagine what eight lane is gonna be,\neight gigabytes.\n\n493\n00:26:18.395 --> 00:26:21.131\nAnd then the 16 lanes is\ngonna be 16 gigabyte.\n\n494\n00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:26.091\nSo let me just recap the single lane\nspeeds for you guys one more time, so\n\n495\n00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:29.410\nyou guys can figure out\nthe other multipliers.\n\n496\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:33.220\nVersion 1.0 we've got 250\nmegabyte transfer speeds.\n\n497\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.320\nVersion 2.0 it doubles,\n500 megabytes transfer speeds.\n\n498\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.908\nVersion 3.0, it doubles,\n\n499\n00:26:38.908 --> 00:26:43.400\nyet again, we've got a gigabyte when it\ncomes to a single-lane transfer speed.\n\n500\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.097\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n&gt;&gt; That makes it easy, and\n\n501\n00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:48.226\nI can do that math, and\nwe can figure out if we've got four,\n\n502\n00:26:48.226 --> 00:26:50.380\nas long as I know that single lane speed.\n\n503\n00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.390\nNow, Wes, are there any other PCI\nstandards we need to be familiar with?\n\n504\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.310\n&gt;&gt; You know?\nThere's one more that they call out, and\n\n505\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.230\nit's kind of simplistic,\nbecause it follows the same standards.\n\n506\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.185\nIt's called mini PCI, mini PCI is\nwhat you would see inside a laptop.\n\n507\n00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:03.642\nSo as far as the standard goes,\n\n508\n00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:06.619\njust know the PCI standards that\nwe've already talked about.\n\n509\n00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:09.206\nHowever, there were three\ndifferent type cards, and\n\n510\n00:27:09.206 --> 00:27:11.748\nthese were really about\nthe connectors themselves.\n\n511\n00:27:11.748 --> 00:27:13.890\nThe standards the same,\nso that's a great thing.\n\n512\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.325\nYou don't have to worry about it being\ndifferent than PCI all together.\n\n513\n00:27:17.325 --> 00:27:20.015\nBut we're talking about,\nit's the same as the original PCI.\n\n514\n00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:23.740\nThey have a type 1 card,\nwhich had 100 pin connector in it.\n\n515\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.930\nA type 2 connector, or a type 2 card,\nwhich, good thing here,\n\n516\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.232\nalso had a 100 pin connector.\n\n517\n00:27:29.232 --> 00:27:29.744\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n518\n00:27:29.744 --> 00:27:31.424\n&gt;&gt; And then they had a type three,\n\n519\n00:27:31.424 --> 00:27:33.684\nthat had slightly different connector,\n\n520\n00:27:33.684 --> 00:27:36.574\nand that was a 124 pin connector.\nAnd again, many PCI, as far\n\n521\n00:27:36.574 --> 00:27:40.044\nas the standard goes, just a smaller form\nfactor that would be shoved inside of\n\n522\n00:27:40.044 --> 00:27:43.370\na laptop, because of the fact that we\ndon't have a lot of space within it.\n\n523\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, so I'm gonna have\nto ask the obvious question, type 1,\n\n524\n00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.669\n100 pins, type 2, 100 pins, there has\nto be a difference though, right?\n\n525\n00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There really is,\n\n526\n00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.930\nwhat it came down to is what\nthe manufacturers implemented them for.\n\n527\n00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.030\nThe most common one was\nreally the type two,\n\n528\n00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.210\nand this would add network functionality\nto a laptop that didn't have it.\n\n529\n00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.190\nSo you'd put one of those type\n2 cards in there, 100 pin card.\n\n530\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.540\nAnd you'd have this little x\njack that would pop out, and\n\n531\n00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.260\nyou could put a modem-\n&gt;&gt; I remember those, yes.\n\n532\n00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.810\n&gt;&gt; RJ 11 jacks, or, as we progressed, you\ncould actually add Ethernet capabilities.\n\n533\n00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.010\nWhich we'll talk about\nthose PCI connections, or,\n\n534\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.010\nexcuse me, the Ethernet connections,\nin another episode.\n\n535\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.000\nThe last one type three, which is\ninteresting, I've never actually seen one.\n\n536\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.220\nAnd it was one that was actually used for\na hard drive.\n\n537\n00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.040\nBut for what ever reason, I've actually\nnever seen one of the type three cards.\n\n538\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.760\nSo type 2 was definitely one of the ones\nthat were more common until lake sorceress\n\n539\n00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.140\nwould come out, which we'll also talk\nabout later, known as the express card.\n\n540\n00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\njust a ton of information there.\n\n541\n00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.555\nIn this particular episode, a lot of\ninformation about the standards, and\n\n542\n00:28:47.555 --> 00:28:49.035\nwhat we need to know to pass the exam.\n\n543\n00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:53.495\nBut over the last three episodes, we've\ncovered all the different components on\n\n544\n00:28:53.495 --> 00:28:55.415\nthat motherboard,\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n545\n00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:59.505\nSo we thank you for that, Wes, appreciate\nit, any parting words for our viewers?\n\n546\n00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:02.545\n&gt;&gt; No, just pay attention to your\nstandards, there's a reason we have them.\n\n547\n00:29:02.545 --> 00:29:06.555\nAnd, as an A+ technician, it's gonna be up\nto you to know what those standards are.\n\n548\n00:29:06.555 --> 00:29:08.250\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell you heard it here folks.\n\n549\n00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.950\nHopefully you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n550\n00:29:09.950 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.790\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.590\nI am your host Zach Memos as\nwe continue on with A+ 901.\n\n6\n00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.050\nAnd today we're looking at RAM types and\nfeatures.\n\n7\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.780\nAnd I know a guy who knows\nmore about this than me.\n\n8\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.900\nAnd his name is Wes Bryan and\nthere he is right there.\n\n9\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, how you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.660\nIt's great to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.200\nThat's right, we're gonna be talking\nabout something I wish I had more of, and\n\n12\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.860\nthat is memory, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.220\nYou might be saying, well, you said RAM.\n\n14\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.050\nWell, if you can't RAM it dodge it.\n\n15\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.790\nThere's our little plug from Mopar for\nthe day.\n\n16\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.490\nBut we are gonna be talking about\nsomething known as random access memory.\n\n17\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.970\nAnd we're gonna go through\nsome of the objectives that\n\n18\n00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.570\nyou can expect to see within the 901 exam,\n220-901 exam.\n\n19\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870\nI'll make sure I got the exam right there.\n\n20\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.330\nBut we're also gonna look at some of\nthe basics as well, maybe not some of\n\n21\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.130\nthe things that are specifically\ncalled out by the objectives but\n\n22\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.310\nwe really want you to understand\nthis concept that we have of memory.\n\n23\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.420\nSo while the objectives are specifically\nfocused on random access memory,\n\n24\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.340\nwe're gonna talk about a few\ndifferent types of memory.\n\n25\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.240\nSo just as an A+ technician,\nyou'll be a little bit more\n\n26\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.670\naware of what you can expect\nto see inside of the industry.\n\n27\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.010\nBecause when it comes to memory, there are\nall different kinds, shapes and sizes and\n\n28\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.940\nit's going to be important to be able\nto distinguish them should you have to\n\n29\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.400\nservice a machine,\nshould you have to replace memory.\n\n30\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.510\nSo, lets go ahead and\nwe will dive right into that.\n\n31\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Wes, what's volatile versus\nnonvolatile, what is that?\n\n32\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.152\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, when it comes\nto nonvolatile we have two, volatile or\n\n33\n00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:43.280\nnonvolatile memory.\n\n34\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.376\nWe've got a little diagram here and\nvery kinda simplistic, all right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:49.759\nWhen we talk about random access memory.\n\n36\n00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.809\nRandom access memory is a type\nof volatile memory, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:55.387\nAnd volatile memory\nmeans that it needs and\n\n38\n00:01:55.387 --> 00:01:59.600\nelectrical current to keep the data\nthat's stored in it refreshed.\n\n39\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.000\nAnd what I mean by that is any\nof the data that the CPU is\n\n40\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.120\nfeeding into that memory\nis going to dissipate.\n\n41\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.070\nIt's gonna disappear.\n\n42\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.200\nSo think about it as like an imprint and\nthen it starts to fade away.\n\n43\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.650\nAnd then we hit it with a little bit of\nelectricity across the motherboard, and\n\n44\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.960\nit refreshes that memory.\n\n45\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.453\nAnd then it starts just a fade away.\n\n46\n00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:25.084\nNow, the next type is non-volatile and\nnon-volatile memory is a type of\n\n47\n00:02:25.084 --> 00:02:29.490\nmemory that doesn't require\nan electrical refresh, if you will, or\n\n48\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.466\nelectrical current to maintain\nthe data that's stored in it.\n\n49\n00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:41.070\nNow, why we use one over the other, why is\nsystem memory, today, RAM vs ROM, right?\n\n50\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.985\nWell, it comes down to the sheer expense.\n\n51\n00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:46.860\nNon-volatile memory is more expensive,\n\n52\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.480\nespecially more expensive\nin larger quantities.\n\n53\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.080\nAnd given today's RAM necessities,\nor system memory necessities,\n\n54\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.930\nit would be a little bit, for\nas far as cost, it would be infeasible to\n\n55\n00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.040\nhave larger quantities of memory like\nthis for our average everyday computing.\n\n56\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.150\nSo when it comes down to it,\nthe RAM, if you will,\n\n57\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.590\nthe volatile memory is cheaper,\nif you will.\n\n58\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.085\nSo we can get it in larger quantities and\nit doesn't cost as much.\n\n59\n00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:18.180\nNow, just when I say that, we have things\nlike our solid state drives out there.\n\n60\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.290\nSolid state drives actually\nuse a non-volatile memory.\n\n61\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.020\nThat's why you can store information,\n\n62\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.480\njust like the old traditional\nmechanical hard drives, on it.\n\n63\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.150\nTurn your computer off, and when you turn\nyour computer back on, well, guess what?\n\n64\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.070\nThat data you can pull right\nback off that solid state drive.\n\n65\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.590\nYou might have seen, too, if you've\nbeen paying attention and if not,\n\n66\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.830\nif you're new to this,\nwe'll kinda make you aware.\n\n67\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.630\nThat solid state drives,\nup until recently, within the last five or\n\n68\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.770\nsix years, have been very,\nvery expensive per gigabyte.\n\n69\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.970\nAnd that's due to the fact that they're\nusing non-volatile memory, again,\n\n70\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.010\nwe're starting to see that price\npoint come down as they find\n\n71\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.240\nbetter ways to make it more cost\nefficient, to make a larger capacities.\n\n72\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.790\nBut when you really look at it,\nthose are the two different things.\n\n73\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.790\nNow, you might notice that here in my\ndiagram, I said RAM, random access memory.\n\n74\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.140\nThe forms of non-volatile\nyou'll see is ROM.\n\n75\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.760\nThat's, read-only memory,\nis an example of that, right?\n\n76\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.260\nSo keep that in mind for your exam.\n\n77\n00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.780\n&gt;&gt; Can you have RAM and\nROM in the same system?\n\n78\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.430\n&gt;&gt; You typically do.\n\n79\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.280\nAnd let me give you a basics here, and\nwe'll definitely come back to some of\n\n80\n00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.180\nthe ROMs, too,\ntowards the end of this episode.\n\n81\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.160\nEven though it's not called\nout on the objectives,\n\n82\n00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.400\nwe really want you to know\nwhat's going on here.\n\n83\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.490\nYou typically have your\nrandom access memory,\n\n84\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.200\nis gonna be inside of your system memory,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.530\nThat's that main memory, you might hear\nit called, and a large quantity of it.\n\n86\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.090\nYou can replace that RAM,\nif you will, through memory\n\n87\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.140\nmodules on the motherboard itself,\nif you remember our motherboard episode.\n\n88\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.200\nROM, you have, that's where we\nstore our BIOS information.\n\n89\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.490\nRemember, that in our BIOS episode, one\nof the things we said is that we have our\n\n90\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.940\nBIOS and that contains\nthe manufacturer's defined settings for\n\n91\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.350\nbasically bringing the hardware online,\nright?\n\n92\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.950\nWell, why is it that I can\nturn my computer off, and\n\n93\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.440\nwhen I turn my computer on, I can boot\ninto BIOS, and all the interface and\n\n94\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.340\neverything, all the capabilities\nare still there?\n\n95\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.580\nWell, that's because that BIOS\ninformation is stored in a ROM chip.\n\n96\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.720\nAnd again, it's a non-volatile chip.\n\n97\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.940\nSo two very, very important concepts.\n\n98\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.295\n&gt;&gt; I knew that I was just testing you.\n\n99\n00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:28.580\n[LAUGH] But actually,\nwhat I wanted to move on to is parity.\n\n100\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.016\nParity, I've heard that's about errors,\nis that right?\n\n101\n00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:32.320\n&gt;&gt; That is right, okay, and\n\n102\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.142\nthere are a couple different kinds\nof parity types, if you will.\n\n103\n00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:40.490\nActually, there's parity and think of it\nas more of an advanced parity, right?\n\n104\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.160\nParity is all about checking errors and\nwhat it essentially means is that what we\n\n105\n00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.070\ndo is when you write data into memory,\nyou typically do it by basis.\n\n106\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.340\nAnd what parity does is\nit allows you to check\n\n107\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.460\nwhether there is an error\npresent in the data.\n\n108\n00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.530\nIn fact I've got a little diagram here,\nlet me show you here.\n\n109\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.850\nWe have what's known as even parity or\nodd parity.\n\n110\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.700\nNow very basically, guys,\ntake all the technical jargons out of it.\n\n111\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.388\nWhat does it mean to be even parity or\nodd parity?\n\n112\n00:06:09.388 --> 00:06:12.550\nAll right, well, it means that\nall of the data that is sent into\n\n113\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.590\nRAM is going to be checked and\nthrough a little manipulation of the data,\n\n114\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.140\nwe should always expect even values or\nodd values, right?\n\n115\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.050\nLe's just say that we expect even values.\n\n116\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.530\nAnd, by the way, your even or odd parity\n\n117\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.620\nis set at the time before you actually\nstart to even write information, right?\n\n118\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.780\nSo we don't pick and\nchoose on the fly, right?\n\n119\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.660\nWe say, okay, it's gonna be even parity.\n\n120\n00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.500\nThen the components in the design\nof the memory itself says,\n\n121\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.790\nokay, at right time, we're gonna\nset that it's gonna be even parity.\n\n122\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.500\nYou don't actually set this,\nit's built into the design itself.\n\n123\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.980\nNow what it does is it says for every byte\nof data, we're gonna count things like,\n\n124\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.570\nfor instance, the one bit.\n\n125\n00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.963\nSo, for instance, in my example here you\ncan see that I have a byte of data and\n\n126\n00:06:52.963 --> 00:06:54.246\nif I count the ones, right?\n\n127\n00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:56.074\nI've got three ones, right?\n\n128\n00:06:56.074 --> 00:07:01.137\nWell, we said we expected every time\nwe send that information into RAM,\n\n129\n00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:03.190\nwe expect an even value.\n\n130\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.460\nSo what parity does,\nis it adds a ninth bit.\n\n131\n00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.860\nSo if 8 bits makes a byte, right?\n\n132\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.380\nSo if I'm gonna send a byte\nof data into memory, and\n\n133\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.540\nin my example,\nthat byte of data is an odd value.\n\n134\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.760\nWell, we're gonna modify it.\n\n135\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.510\nWe're gonna add one extra bit, and\nnow you count them all up, they're even.\n\n136\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.120\nAnd we're gonna send it into RAM.\n\n137\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.610\nThen the RAM will be checked and\nif the value is even it means that, well,\n\n138\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.320\npassively we've detected that nothing's\nreally changed with the data and\n\n139\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.440\nit's valid.\n\n140\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.750\nHowever, if we send that information,\nagain, I've already denoted that it's\n\n141\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.760\neven parity, we add the parity bit,\nin this case to make it even.\n\n142\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.688\nWe send it into the RAM and\nthe memory controller checks it and\n\n143\n00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:50.593\nsays, wait, I found an odd value.\n\n144\n00:07:50.593 --> 00:07:53.215\nWell, the controller knows that\nsomething's wrong with the information.\n\n145\n00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:55.402\nNow, when I say something's\nwrong with the information,\n\n146\n00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:57.031\ndon't think there's a hacker doing this.\n\n147\n00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:00.739\nWe have a lot of considerations\nwhen it comes to RAM, right?\n\n148\n00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:03.870\nYou have electromagnetic interference\nthat happens across the board.\n\n149\n00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.790\nAnytime you have electromagnetic\ninterference it can corrupt your data.\n\n150\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.920\nThe more voltage you\napply to an interface,\n\n151\n00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.010\nthe more susceptible you are to\nelectromagnetic interference, right?\n\n152\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.450\nSo, that could corrupt the data.\n\n153\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.200\nNow, there is a problem with parity.\n\n154\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.840\nParity is a passive air checking.\n\n155\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.360\nYou can just say, okay, we've detected\nan error, we're gonna throw it away.\n\n156\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.030\nNow I do want you to know that\nwhen you talk about parity memory,\n\n157\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.640\nparity memory by itself,\nit's really out of date.\n\n158\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.840\nWe don't really use it any more cuz\nof the fact that it's just passive.\n\n159\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.774\nBut I also want you to know\nthere's 12.5% overhead.\n\n160\n00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:42.884\nBecause for every byte of data that's your\ngood data, that your CPU's gonna process,\n\n161\n00:08:42.884 --> 00:08:47.459\nyou're adding a single bit, whether\nit's a zero bit binary, at one or zero.\n\n162\n00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:53.541\nIt's gonna add a 12.5% overhead to the\ninformation that's stored in that area,\n\n163\n00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:54.450\nalright?\n\n164\n00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.807\nSo keep in mind that that\nis what your parity is.\n\n165\n00:08:56.807 --> 00:09:00.360\nIt's about passively detecting errors.\n\n166\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.070\nAgain, this is an older form\nof memory checking, right?\n\n167\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.440\nWe don't really use this anymore.\n\n168\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.970\nWhat commonly we use today is\nwhat's known as ECC memory.\n\n169\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.900\nNow, I want you to think as\nECC memory is like parity.\n\n170\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.770\nThink of it as an advanced parity.\n\n171\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:19.190\nNot only can we detect the errors\nlike parity does, but ECC is\n\n172\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:24.810\nthe Error Correcting Code, and what it can\ndo, find of all it's kind of interesting.\n\n173\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.770\nYou find it in servers.\n\n174\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.640\nIt's very expensive.\n\n175\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.490\nYou don't typically find this\nin your common workstations.\n\n176\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.960\nMaybe high end workstations that are doing\nthings like video rendering and stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.860\nYou might find it there because\nit can be very expensive.\n\n178\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.710\nBut not only can it detect the errors\nthat are present in memory,\n\n179\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.550\nit can implement a code to fix it.\n\n180\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.110\nSo and that's very good.\n\n181\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.800\nAnd why is that good?\n\n182\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.936\nWell, I want you to think in servers,\nif you're not aware what a server is,\n\n183\n00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:50.464\nit's just like any other computer.\n\n184\n00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:53.179\nHowever, it's a computer that\nhas a lot of power, right.\n\n185\n00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:56.200\nIt's the difference between the old\n84 Ford that I've talked about,\n\n186\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.415\nthe one that I used and has got a four\ncylinder and the Lamborghini or Ferrari or\n\n187\n00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:00.325\nBugatti if you will.\n\n188\n00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:03.690\nServers are found in\nEnterprise environments.\n\n189\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.330\nAnd what they do is that when\nthat data is stored in memory,\n\n190\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.030\nit is very,very important,\nthis is mission critical data.\n\n191\n00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:15.770\nWe can't afford a corruption in let's say\nan application that's running a database\n\n192\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.040\nthat stores all of the information for\nthings like credit card payments.\n\n193\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.390\nYou don't want some kind of\nerror in credit card payments,\n\n194\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.480\nbecause you either gonna charge\nsomebody maybe too much,\n\n195\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.670\nor maybe you're not gonna\nget charged at all, right.\n\n196\n00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.280\nSo we wanna make sure that that\ndata stays in an uncorrupt,\n\n197\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.540\nstable, and reliable manner.\n\n198\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.590\nAnd that's what ECC memory is.\n\n199\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.680\nNow, with ECC memory,\nlike I said, it is expensive.\n\n200\n00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.610\nThe one thing I want you to understand is\nthat, non-ECC memory doesn't you know it\n\n201\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.700\ndoesn't have the error correcting,\nthat's what you find more commonly, right?\n\n202\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.530\nCuz ECC memory is for\nthe enterprise level environment,\n\n203\n00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.180\nvery expensive on the cost\nside if you will.\n\n204\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.590\nAnd in our home environments,\nin our normal computing environments,\n\n205\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.410\nthe computer that you're sitting at right\nnow unless you're sitting at a server,\n\n206\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.860\nthat maybe that doesn't apply.\n\n207\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.680\nBut and then the computer that you're\nsitting at right now has non-ECC memory.\n\n208\n00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.420\nAnd why is that?\n\n209\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.280\nWell, I mean, if we're not really\nworried too much about a little bit of\n\n210\n00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.457\na data corruption in our home work\nstations, at worst we reboot the computer,\n\n211\n00:11:14.457 --> 00:11:16.698\nmaybe the application crashes or hangs.\n\n212\n00:11:16.698 --> 00:11:21.100\nBut we're not really worried about losing\nthat data, unlike your corporations.\n\n213\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.150\nThe other thing to keep in mind is\nthat ECC memory cannot be mixed\n\n214\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.260\nwith non-ECC memory.\n\n215\n00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.670\nOne of the things that sometimes you\ncan tell is on the little RAM modules,\n\n216\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.170\nwhich we'll get into and\nwe'll show you guys.\n\n217\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.970\nWe won't just be all lecture here.\n\n218\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.960\nWe're gonna kinda show you\nsome of the hands-on goodies.\n\n219\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.840\nIt's one of the reasons I love A+ is\nactually looking at the hardware.\n\n220\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.310\nIs that ECC memory usually has a little\nextra chip on the memory module itself,\n\n221\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.300\nthe printed circuit board.\n\n222\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.610\nIt's one of the ways, a lot of times,\nyou can tell what it is.\n\n223\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.950\nSo, Zach, when you talk about parity,\n\n224\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.100\nkeep in mind there are two\ndifferent kinds of parities.\n\n225\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.370\nAnd it gets kind of confusing cuz\nreally ECC memory is advanced parity.\n\n226\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.910\nIt just means that not only like\nparity can we detect that error, but\n\n227\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.770\nrather than doing what parity does and\njust discards the information.\n\n228\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.030\nThere is actually code that\ncan fix the information or\n\n229\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.070\nrebuild it, correct those errors.\n\n230\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.820\nAgain in our server environments there\nare enterprise environments where it's so\n\n231\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.250\nimportant to have reliable stable system.\n\n232\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.620\nThis is where you're gonna find it and\nit can be very expensive.\n\n233\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.110\n&gt;&gt; Wes, we talked about channels.\n\n234\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.200\nThe single, dual, triple, is that right?\n\n235\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes there are and that is another\nthing that kinda gets confusing.\n\n236\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.420\nAll right, if we could take\na look at our motherboard here.\n\n237\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.370\nNow one of the things that I want you\nto see is we've got a motherboard\n\n238\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.440\nout here, all right.\n\n239\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.260\nAnd in our earlier episodes,\nwhen we were talking about motherboards,\n\n240\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.890\nwe were talking about all different\nkinds of things like the system bus and\n\n241\n00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.280\nthe memory controller hub.\n\n242\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.166\nBut one of the things I want you to\nunderstand that in today's day and\n\n243\n00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:48.220\nage, one of the reasons we use RAM, okay.\n\n244\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.910\nAnd I want you to think of your random\naccess memory that we have here as being\n\n245\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.930\na temporary workbench for your data.\n\n246\n00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.930\nThe more you have of it,\nthe bigger the workbench.\n\n247\n00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.040\nSo the more RAM I have,\nthe more data we can process at one time.\n\n248\n00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.390\nBut there are limitations to the RAM and\nthat's why we say non volatile.\n\n249\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.190\nIt's a temporary workbench.\n\n250\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.610\nNow the reason we use RAM in\ncombination with the CPU is cuz\n\n251\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.860\nthe CPU is light years faster\nthan anything on the motherboard.\n\n252\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.555\nNothing that we have in a computing\nenvironment is as fast as a CPU.\n\n253\n00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:25.520\nCPUs today can do upwards of 4 billion\ncalculations in a single second.\n\n254\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.270\n4 billion calculations, right?\n\n255\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.875\nSo we can't use like traditional storage\nmechanisms like hard drives because\n\n256\n00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.625\nEinstein said, time is relative, right?\n\n257\n00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:38.605\nSo to me watching an eagle fly out\nof the sky and hit and come down and\n\n258\n00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:41.755\nget that fish, you know to me it\nmight have been 30 seconds, but\n\n259\n00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:43.840\nto that eagle it might have\nbeen a split second, right?\n\n260\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.741\nSo the problem is RAM is\nkind of slow in that aspect.\n\n261\n00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:54.895\nSo RAM works in nano seconds and\nthe same thing with the CPU.\n\n262\n00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:59.550\nSo I wanna kind of touch base on that, but\nwhen it comes to the channels even memory\n\n263\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.530\nitself is kind of lagging when you\nlook at the performance of the CPU.\n\n264\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.980\nSo CPUs today, or excuse me,\nRAM modules today, these little\n\n265\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.490\nRAM modules that you see right here,\nif I don't move that all around.\n\n266\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.690\nThese are 64 bit devices each.\n\n267\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.760\nAnd here's a problem, if you have\na one pipeline 64 bits at a time.\n\n268\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.691\nAnd if we think of stacking these\nsequentially on themselves and\n\n269\n00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:28.638\nI got only a single pipeline, it doesn't\nmatter that I have four RAM modules that\n\n270\n00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:31.877\nI'm piping data into the CPU\nfrom four RAM modules.\n\n271\n00:14:31.877 --> 00:14:34.106\nIf they're all sitting\non a single highway,\n\n272\n00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:36.170\nI'm only going to get 64 bits at a time.\n\n273\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.736\nIt will just be sequential 64 bits.\n\n274\n00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:40.742\nI want you to think of\nthat as a single channel.\n\n275\n00:14:40.742 --> 00:14:45.280\nNow wouldn't it be nice that on the\nmotherboard itself, these little traces.\n\n276\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.010\nIf we can just back out\nthere just a little bit\n\n277\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.630\nyou'll see that there\nare all these little traces.\n\n278\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.250\nPerfect, thank you.\n\n279\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.810\nAll these little traces right here,\nimagine being able to have two channels.\n\n280\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.680\nAll right, or two highways.\n\n281\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.420\nNow one highway can serve a 64 bits\nto the CPU and the other highway,\n\n282\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.330\nthe RAM module that's sitting\non it can cycle in 64 bits.\n\n283\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.670\nAnd essentially what we have is,\n\n284\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:15.590\nthese laying side by side basically\npumping in 128-bit with into the CPU.\n\n285\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.847\nAnd that's because with multi-core CPUs,\n\n286\n00:15:18.847 --> 00:15:22.368\neach core can process 64\nbits of data at a time.\n\n287\n00:15:22.368 --> 00:15:26.068\nAnd the problem is if you're on a single\nchannel and you're only doing 64 bits at\n\n288\n00:15:26.068 --> 00:15:28.710\na time, a lot of times some of\nthose cores just get wasted.\n\n289\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.090\nThey're sitting there idol.\n\n290\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.821\nSo they found an ingenious way that says,\nhow about we separate the data paths, and\n\n291\n00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:36.654\nwe'll have two 64 bit paths.\n\n292\n00:15:36.654 --> 00:15:40.459\nAnd we can keep those cores really busy,\nand try to take and\n\n293\n00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:45.120\nmake the most efficient utilization\nof the power of the CPU.\n\n294\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.900\nLet me show you what I mean here too.\n\n295\n00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.695\nWe're gonna be all over the place today.\n\n296\n00:15:48.695 --> 00:15:53.298\nI got a little diagram out here and this\ndiagram kinda shows you what I mean here,\n\n297\n00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:57.971\nwhen we talk about single channel I want\nyou to understand that a single channel,\n\n298\n00:15:57.971 --> 00:16:01.982\nit wouldn't matter if I had four\nmemory modules on a single channel.\n\n299\n00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:05.010\nEach one of these channels\nis piping in 64 bits.\n\n300\n00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:10.636\nNow notice that's just 64 bits,\nit chews it off, 64 bits, it chews it off.\n\n301\n00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:15.588\nBut if we do dual channel however,\nnow what we have is 64\n\n302\n00:16:15.588 --> 00:16:20.039\nbits going across this bus,\nor traces if you will.\n\n303\n00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:24.846\n64 bits across this bus going in,\n128 bit, right?\n\n304\n00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:27.853\nA massive super highway, right?\n\n305\n00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:30.806\nAnd then what they did, and\nI put quad channel in here too,\n\n306\n00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:35.049\nbecause that's more common today, this\nis 2017 as of the taping of this show.\n\n307\n00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:37.090\nAnd even though they don't\ncall it out on the exam,\n\n308\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.620\nthat's commonly what you're\ngonna see as high performance.\n\n309\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.032\nAt the time of the objectives,\ntriple channel was kinda common.\n\n310\n00:16:42.032 --> 00:16:43.546\nIt was just kinda up and coming.\n\n311\n00:16:43.546 --> 00:16:45.535\nAnd it does the same thing, right?\n\n312\n00:16:45.535 --> 00:16:46.329\nWhat do we got?\n\n313\n00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:49.369\nThat's 3 times 64,\nI believe that's 192 bits, right?\n\n314\n00:16:49.369 --> 00:16:53.300\nNow we have 192 bits if we talk\nabout triple channel memory, right?\n\n315\n00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.201\nAnd Intel has some massive processors\nthat are doing quad channel, and\n\n316\n00:16:58.201 --> 00:17:02.040\nwe're talking 256 bits that\nit can go into the CPU and\n\n317\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.731\neven at that,\nmemory's still slower than your CPU.\n\n318\n00:17:05.731 --> 00:17:09.161\nSo that's the purpose of\nthe configurations when we talk about RAM,\n\n319\n00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:12.889\nis you're talking about taking multiple\nhighways and 64 bits at a time,\n\n320\n00:17:12.889 --> 00:17:16.044\njust pumping it in the CPU so\nit can sit there and chew that data.\n\n321\n00:17:16.044 --> 00:17:18.336\nBasically trying to make those cores,\n\n322\n00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.048\nlet's utilize those\ncores a little bit more.\n\n323\n00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:23.152\nNow that comes to RAM configurations, and\n\n324\n00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:27.015\nthat's one of the things that they call\nout, that I want to kind of talk about.\n\n325\n00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:30.380\nCuz it goes hand in hand\nwith single channel memory.\n\n326\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.380\nIf we could take a look and kinda zoom\nout here at this motherboard one time,\n\n327\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.770\nyou'll see that there are, in fact\nthat's actually perfect right there.\n\n328\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:43.345\nNotice that we have four different\nindividual channels here,\n\n329\n00:17:43.345 --> 00:17:45.603\nI'm sorry RAM slots, right?\n\n330\n00:17:45.603 --> 00:17:47.201\nNow this is a dual channel board,\n\n331\n00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:49.610\nI already know that cuz\nI've looked at the specs.\n\n332\n00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.339\nAnd you can't really tell\nthat just by looking, so\n\n333\n00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:55.265\npay attention to specification\nin your motherboard.\n\n334\n00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:57.075\nBut this is two channels, right?\n\n335\n00:17:57.075 --> 00:18:00.596\nAnd there is an order you\nhave to install them in, and\n\n336\n00:18:00.596 --> 00:18:03.809\nthat isn't gonna\nnecessarily be color coded.\n\n337\n00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:05.812\nThat's another thing\nyou have to understand,\n\n338\n00:18:05.812 --> 00:18:07.975\ncuz not every motherboard\nis gonna be color coded.\n\n339\n00:18:07.975 --> 00:18:10.991\nServer memory, they don't care about\nthe color and the fancy design,\n\n340\n00:18:10.991 --> 00:18:14.318\nthey just want it to be powerful, so\nevery single socket can be the same color.\n\n341\n00:18:14.318 --> 00:18:16.159\nSo pay attention to your configurations.\n\n342\n00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:20.855\nBut if I was to move this module and put\nthem side by side, essentially I would be\n\n343\n00:18:20.855 --> 00:18:25.712\nback to single channel, because two of\nthese memory modules are on one channel.\n\n344\n00:18:25.712 --> 00:18:27.256\nLet me restate that.\n\n345\n00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:32.658\nTwo of these RAM slots are on one channel,\nand two of them are on another channel.\n\n346\n00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:37.051\nAnd if you don't install them right, like\nI said, if I was to move this one over\n\n347\n00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:41.112\nhere and install it side by side,\nlet's say in four here, two and four,\n\n348\n00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:44.938\nthe problem is I've installed two\nRAM modules in a single channel.\n\n349\n00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:48.483\nSo now, what I've kinda done is I've\ndefeated the purpose of having dual\n\n350\n00:18:48.483 --> 00:18:52.501\nchannel, because now we're just piping\nback in to 64 bit, 64 bit, 64 bit.\n\n351\n00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:57.377\nSo that is something to keep in mind when\nit comes to your RAM implementations\n\n352\n00:18:57.377 --> 00:19:00.513\nis pay attention to the configuration,\nright?\n\n353\n00:19:00.513 --> 00:19:05.068\nA lot of times your home machines have\nnice color coordination on them, and\n\n354\n00:19:05.068 --> 00:19:08.844\nyou'll see that they differ\nthe colors across the channels.\n\n355\n00:19:08.844 --> 00:19:10.856\nThat's not a guarantee.\n\n356\n00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:14.121\nPay attention to the specifications of the\nmotherboard, because a lot of times, and\n\n357\n00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:17.431\nmost of the times, all the time, you can\nread the manufacturer's recommendations,\n\n358\n00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:19.728\nand it'll say,\nif you're gonna run it in single channel.\n\n359\n00:19:19.728 --> 00:19:23.352\nBecause there's times that you might\ndo this and let me give you an example.\n\n360\n00:19:23.352 --> 00:19:26.927\nYou're buying a PC, or building a PC,\nfor a home user that just has a starting\n\n361\n00:19:26.927 --> 00:19:30.392\nbudget and they say, well let me see how\nthis is gonna work and if it works for\n\n362\n00:19:30.392 --> 00:19:34.029\nme that's great but we'll upgrade it\nlater down the road if I need to, right?\n\n363\n00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:36.943\nI have that flexibility if\nI have all those RAM slots.\n\n364\n00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:42.035\nWell here's the thing, you might start out\nwith let's say eight gigs of RAM, right?.\n\n365\n00:19:42.035 --> 00:19:45.255\nAnd you might not populate\nall of a quad channel board,\n\n366\n00:19:45.255 --> 00:19:49.959\nbut later on down the road you might say\nnow I wanna add those other four modules.\n\n367\n00:19:49.959 --> 00:19:54.570\nAnd that's why it's important to make sure\nthat if you're gonna populate every single\n\n368\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.387\nRAM slot, don't worry about it.\n\n369\n00:19:56.387 --> 00:20:00.155\nYou populated the whole thing,\nyou're using all the channels.\n\n370\n00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:03.781\nBut if you're not, if you aren't\ngonna populate all of the channels,\n\n371\n00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:08.072\npay attention to the RAM configuration cuz\nyou can actually do yourself a disservice\n\n372\n00:20:08.072 --> 00:20:11.578\nby having nice fast memory and\nyou installed it in a single channel and\n\n373\n00:20:11.578 --> 00:20:13.227\nyou never see the performance.\n\n374\n00:20:13.227 --> 00:20:16.228\nSo that is something that\nis gonna be important.\n\n375\n00:20:16.228 --> 00:20:18.723\n&gt;&gt; What about single sided, double sided?\n\n376\n00:20:18.723 --> 00:20:21.662\nIs that inferring like a record?\n\n377\n00:20:21.662 --> 00:20:24.774\nThe old LP had two sides and\neven the tape.\n\n378\n00:20:24.774 --> 00:20:27.271\nYou'd actually flip tapes around,\nespecially reel of reels.\n\n379\n00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:28.680\n&gt;&gt; You know when I first.\n\n380\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.504\n[LAUGH] That's a great question.\n\n381\n00:20:30.504 --> 00:20:34.240\nAnd you guys might think that it's a joke,\nbut it really isn't.\n\n382\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.899\nBut when I first started studying A+,\nway back when I first took my A+ exam,\n\n383\n00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:39.489\nthat's exactly what I thought.\n\n384\n00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:40.400\nWhat does this mean?\n\n385\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.195\nDoes this mean that like dvds, tapes,\ntape cassettes, record players,\n\n386\n00:20:44.195 --> 00:20:46.076\nyou're gonna flip and turn it over.\n\n387\n00:20:46.076 --> 00:20:47.042\nIt's not like that.\n\n388\n00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:48.496\nIt's not what it means, all right?\n\n389\n00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:52.918\nWhat it means is that the electrical\ncontacts on the RAM module itself,\n\n390\n00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.655\nyou got electrical contacts on both sides.\n\n391\n00:20:55.655 --> 00:21:00.014\nAnd essentially, I could show you here\nwhere the contacts are on both sides.\n\n392\n00:21:00.014 --> 00:21:02.832\nNow, when it comes down to it,\nwhat does that mean for performance?\n\n393\n00:21:02.832 --> 00:21:06.793\nWell, It really doesn't make\ntoo much of a difference.\n\n394\n00:21:06.793 --> 00:21:11.850\nIt just means how much of the memory in\ntotality can the memory controller see,\n\n395\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:12.624\nall right?\n\n396\n00:21:12.624 --> 00:21:13.847\nIf it's single sided,\n\n397\n00:21:13.847 --> 00:21:17.037\nit means it could use and\naddress all of the memory at one time.\n\n398\n00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:19.770\nIt doesn't matter how much memory\nyou have, it could see all of it and\n\n399\n00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.962\naddress all of it at one time.\n\n400\n00:21:20.962 --> 00:21:25.586\nIf it's double sided memory, what it means\nis that it's separated into memory banks.\n\n401\n00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:29.195\nAnd memory bank must be initiated to\nswitch over to the second bank then\n\n402\n00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:31.903\nto further address the memory and\nsend data into it.\n\n403\n00:21:31.903 --> 00:21:33.546\nBut as far as the performance hit is,\n\n404\n00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:36.196\nit's not really something\nyou're gonna notice too much.\n\n405\n00:21:36.196 --> 00:21:42.811\nNow there's always speculation on that,\nand we can go down the route of memory,\n\n406\n00:21:42.811 --> 00:21:47.010\nI don't know,\nthere are some speculations on it.\n\n407\n00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.619\nBut what it really boils down to is when\nwe say single sided and double sided, it\n\n408\n00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:54.300\nmeans how much of the memory is accessible\nby the memory controller at one time.\n\n409\n00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.391\nSingle sided means it can see the whole\nthing, address the whole thing.\n\n410\n00:21:57.391 --> 00:22:00.729\nWhen it comes to double-sided,\nit means it's seen in rows and banks and\n\n411\n00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:04.298\ntheir bank has to be initiated between\neach of the sides of the memory module.\n\n412\n00:22:04.298 --> 00:22:07.345\n&gt;&gt; Perfect,\nnow we've been talking a lot about theory.\n\n413\n00:22:07.345 --> 00:22:10.085\nBut are we gonna be getting\ninto specifications, Wes?\n\n414\n00:22:10.085 --> 00:22:14.017\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nA+ wouldn't be A+ without some standards.\n\n415\n00:22:14.017 --> 00:22:17.059\nSee we want you to kinda\nunderstand the concepts, guys and\n\n416\n00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:21.361\ngals out there before we just bombard you\nwith specifications that a lot of times.\n\n417\n00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:25.286\nDon't be intimidated by it, but sometimes\nfor the A+ exam, you have to prove that\n\n418\n00:22:25.286 --> 00:22:29.061\nyou understand the lingo, you have to\nprove that you know the specifications.\n\n419\n00:22:29.061 --> 00:22:33.010\nAnd a lot of times they're really\nimportant on the exam to understand these,\n\n420\n00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.637\nbut it's also important\nto understand concepts.\n\n421\n00:22:35.637 --> 00:22:38.976\nSo yeah, we do have to go in the\nspecification but Zack's giving me that\n\n422\n00:22:38.976 --> 00:22:42.160\nevil eye over there and I know that\nwe are coming up on some time here.\n\n423\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.944\nSo let me go ahead and\ntackle a couple of concepts there and\n\n424\n00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:47.910\nwe'll probably have to leave\nthem with a cliff hanger here.\n\n425\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:53.070\nThey call out what is known as\na buffered and unbuffered memory.\n\n426\n00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.563\nAll right, now buffered and\nunbuffered have,\n\n427\n00:22:56.563 --> 00:23:01.283\nsometimes they're confusing\nbecause you learn one concept and\n\n428\n00:23:01.283 --> 00:23:05.579\nthen you learn it has 15\ndifferent synonyms if you will.\n\n429\n00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:07.729\nSo let me just see if I can\nhelp you out with this.\n\n430\n00:23:07.729 --> 00:23:12.710\nYou might hear buffered and unbuffered,\nbut you also might hear registered and\n\n431\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.761\nunregistered.\n\n432\n00:23:13.761 --> 00:23:15.075\nThey're the same, they're synonymous.\n\n433\n00:23:15.075 --> 00:23:16.251\nDon't let that confuse you.\n\n434\n00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:19.366\nSo in the context here, you're gonna\nhear me use them interchangeably.\n\n435\n00:23:19.366 --> 00:23:22.344\nSo that when you go out there and\nstudy them, you'll know that you're not\n\n436\n00:23:22.344 --> 00:23:25.274\nlosing your mind trying to find out\nwhat's going on when somebody says,\n\n437\n00:23:25.274 --> 00:23:28.033\nI'm not talking about buffered,\nI'm talking about registered.\n\n438\n00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:32.659\nAll right, so here we go with buffered,\nalso known as registered, all right?\n\n439\n00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:34.656\nWe talked about ECC memory, right?\n\n440\n00:23:34.656 --> 00:23:40.638\nECC memory, a lot of times,\nis registered memory or buffered memory.\n\n441\n00:23:40.638 --> 00:23:44.966\nAgain, I'm gonna probably do you guys\nsome injustice out here, all right?\n\n442\n00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:49.613\nBuffered memory just basically means\nthat it has a register that sits between\n\n443\n00:23:49.613 --> 00:23:54.342\nthe memory controller that accesses RAM,\nand the module itself, all right?\n\n444\n00:23:54.342 --> 00:23:55.915\nSo what does that module do?\n\n445\n00:23:55.915 --> 00:23:58.735\nWell, first of all, that register,\nright, in the buffered memory,\n\n446\n00:23:58.735 --> 00:24:00.980\nthat's why ithey call\nit registered memory.\n\n447\n00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.560\nWhat it does is that it ensures that it\n\n448\n00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.000\nbasically it lessens\nthe electrical load on the memory.\n\n449\n00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.930\nAnd any time you reduce\nthe electrical load,\n\n450\n00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:11.670\nthere's a couple of things that happen.\n\n451\n00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.550\nYou will reduce a little bit of\nlatency you'll introduce and\n\n452\n00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.630\nyou'll reduce a little bit of\nthe performance speeds that you'll get but\n\n453\n00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.470\nyou increase stability\nreliability of the data.\n\n454\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:25.520\nWhich means that the data's\ngonna be more expensive,\n\n455\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.780\nbut again,\nit's gonna be more reliable, right?\n\n456\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.560\nMore resistant to corruption.\n\n457\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.650\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings about registered memory,\n\n458\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.450\nor buffered memory if you will.\n\n459\n00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.933\nMost of your ECC memory is\ngoing to be a buffered memory.\n\n460\n00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:42.050\nAnd it's just that register that sits in\nbetween the controller and the memory, and\n\n461\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.450\nit helps to, basically lessen the\nelectrical load on the memory itself and\n\n462\n00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:51.190\nprovides you with some stability and the\nreliability, if you will, of your data.\n\n463\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.050\nNow unbuffered memory is what we\nfind in our non ECC memory, right?\n\n464\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.410\nThis is the most common conventional\nmemory that's out there that's in\n\n465\n00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.810\nour laptops here, Zack and my laptops.\n\n466\n00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.310\nProbably if you're at a laptop if\nyou will, or even a mobile device,\n\n467\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.590\nyou hear Zack say that\nlearning wherever you go.\n\n468\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.850\nI mean you talk about your phone,\nyou talk about your tablets,\n\n469\n00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.330\nthey're unbuffered memory, unregistered.\n\n470\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.980\nWell, just remember register lack thereof,\nright?\n\n471\n00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.840\nthat's why it's called unregistered or\nthat's why it's called unbuffered.\n\n472\n00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.770\nNow, what's the benefit?\n\n473\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.755\nWell the benefit is it's less expensive\nand that's always good especially if\n\n474\n00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:27.460\nyou're frugal like I am,\nyou know that it's less expensive.\n\n475\n00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.860\nBut the other thing is it\nincreases the performance too.\n\n476\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.970\nRemember, when we talk\nabout home stations and\n\n477\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.090\nwork stations what we mean is we\ndon't need the expensive memory,\n\n478\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.455\nif you're gonna throw some expense at\nyour memory just get more of it, right?\n\n479\n00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:42.570\nCuz I don't worry about\nthe corruption of the information.\n\n480\n00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.320\nNow that doesn't mean at the home\nenvironment we don't care if your\n\n481\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.040\ndata corrupts.\n\n482\n00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.660\nI mean obviously you do to a point but\n\n483\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.760\nit's not mission critical\nlike it is in corporation.\n\n484\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.902\nSo an unbuffered or unregistered memory\nmodule has direct memory access,\n\n485\n00:25:55.902 --> 00:25:59.805\nI don't have middle man to go through,\nright?\n\n486\n00:25:59.805 --> 00:26:01.126\nIf you will, pardon the pun here but\n\n487\n00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:02.946\nI don't have a middle man to go through,\nright?\n\n488\n00:26:02.946 --> 00:26:06.815\nThe memory controller talks to the\nregister, talks to the memory control or\n\n489\n00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:09.910\nthe memory itself inside of registered or\nbuffered memory.\n\n490\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.390\nUnbuffered, if you will, or non registered\nmemory takes that whole thing out,\n\n491\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.620\nlowers the price,\nincreases the performance.\n\n492\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.970\nBut anytime we talk about not\nhaving that register in there,\n\n493\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.740\nwe also talk about you don't\nhave a stable memory and\n\n494\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.530\nthe memory itself might not be, it isn't\nas reliable as the buffered memory.\n\n495\n00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.680\nSo keep those in mind,\n\n496\n00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.600\nthose are a couple of concepts that\nyou need to know for the exam.\n\n497\n00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.450\nBut like I said,\nZack's giving that look and\n\n498\n00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.055\nit does look like, we're gonna have\nto leave you with a cliff hanger.\n\n499\n00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:43.035\n&gt;&gt; But there will be a part two of RAM\ntypes and features as we continue on\n\n500\n00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:47.575\nwith A+ 901, thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n501\n00:26:47.575 --> 00:26:50.485\nYou know a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n502\n00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:51.455\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n503\n00:26:51.455 --> 00:26:52.375\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n504\n00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:55.019\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:15.572\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:17.730\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.060\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.120\nAs we continue on with A+ 901 and\nRAM types and features.\n\n8\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.940\nThis is part two.\n\n9\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.301\nAnd we did have a part one.\n\n10\n00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.710\nAnd of course, bringing us all\nthis information is Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.650\nWes, good morning, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.710\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how are we doing, Zack?\n\n13\n00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n&gt;&gt; Great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.540\nThat's right, we are coming back\nwith a part two because, well,\n\n15\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.160\nI talked a lot in the first episode.\n\n16\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.874\nWe didn't get through a lot of\nthe standards that we have to talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:43.820\nIn the first episode we kind of introduced\nyou to more of the theory side, right?\n\n18\n00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.780\nWhat is this thing that\nwe call system memory?\n\n19\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.850\nWe talked about the fact that\nit's a temporary work bench.\n\n20\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.994\nIt's a temporary storage location for\nyour data.\n\n21\n00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:57.249\nBut unlike things like your traditional\ndata or your traditional hard drives,\n\n22\n00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.732\nwe temporarily store our data there,\nright.\n\n23\n00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:05.168\nAnd the reason that we use random access\nmemory is because it works in nanoseconds,\n\n24\n00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:05.720\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.600\nMost of the other storage devices that\nyou have, pretty much all of them,\n\n26\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.230\neven your solid state drives work in\nmilliseconds, and it's just not efficient.\n\n27\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.751\nThe processors are so fast that if\nyou were to use traditional storage,\n\n28\n00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:19.811\nyou wouldn't be really having\na good computing experience.\n\n29\n00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:23.093\nSo we talked about non-volatile and\nvolatile memory, and\n\n30\n00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:27.725\nif these concepts don't really make sense\nbecause maybe you're just joining us.\n\n31\n00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:28.960\nJump back and watch the first part, and\n\n32\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.660\nwe'll see you back here\nin the second part.\n\n33\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we also went over\nthings like RAM verses ROM,\n\n34\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.195\nparity verses non-parity, ECC, non ECC.\n\n35\n00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:38.985\nSingle channel versus dual channel.\n\n36\n00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:41.105\nIt was a great episode,\nmake sure you catch that.\n\n37\n00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.155\nBut now, we're gonna be talking\nabout specifications, right?\n\n38\n00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:43.655\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n39\n00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:45.125\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Here comes some of the stuff that's\n\n40\n00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:46.625\nmore like push-ups or sit-ups.\n\n41\n00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:47.929\nAnd like I joked around,\n\n42\n00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.414\nseriously joking, you could tell that I\ndon't really do too many sit-ups, right?\n\n43\n00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is the stuff that you kinda\n\n44\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.205\ngotta just put that mental cap on,\nand strap yourself into the chair and\n\n45\n00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:02.200\njust hold on to the roller coaster\nride and don't let it intimidate you.\n\n46\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.250\nWe had one of our good viewers out\nthere in the chat room that says\n\n47\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.680\nit can be intimidating, and it can.\n\n48\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.030\nBut understand that you can do this.\n\n49\n00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.910\nIt just takes exposure to the information.\n\n50\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.671\nAnd treat it like a hobby and\nyou can get there.\n\n51\n00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.742\nTrust me I know cuz I remember\nthe first A+ exam I ever sat,\n\n52\n00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:21.631\nI was sweating bullets, and even today\nwith all the exams that I've taken\n\n53\n00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.218\nI still get really nervous,\nbut you can do this.\n\n54\n00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:27.850\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about some concepts.\n\n55\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.050\nNow we do have to talk about the size and\n\n56\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.890\nthe shape of the RAM slots that\nwe have on the motherboard.\n\n57\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.610\nAnd these have to do with what's\nknown as DIMM and SO-DIMM.\n\n58\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.122\n&gt;&gt; Okay and\nwe're talking about DIMM and SO-DIMM.\n\n59\n00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:42.970\nIs this like Dumb and Dumber?\n\n60\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.770\n&gt;&gt; No not really.\n\n61\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.765\nYou think so, its so dim.\n\n62\n00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.940\n[LAUGH] No, what this has to\ndo is this is the actual RAM,\n\n63\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.930\nwe are not actually talking\nabout the module, right?\n\n64\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.930\nThe module,\n\n65\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.940\nlet's get another little jargon out\nof there if you're not familiar.\n\n66\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.900\nThe module itself if you will,\nthat's what specifies the RAM PCB,\n\n67\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.310\nthe printed circuit board that\nyou install into the motherboard.\n\n68\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.148\nNow what you install it into if you will\nis going to be what's known as a DIMM\n\n69\n00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.172\nslot, right?\n\n70\n00:03:11.172 --> 00:03:15.406\nSo if we can take a look real quick at our\nmotherboard here you can see that we've\n\n71\n00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:19.728\nalready got a couple of modules installed\ninto the sockets of the motherboard.\n\n72\n00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:23.218\nAnd they call them out as RAM slots,\nbut these are what are known as DIMMs,\n\n73\n00:03:23.218 --> 00:03:24.200\nall right?\n\n74\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.890\nThat is another acronym,\nsorry about the alphabet soup so\n\n75\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.590\nearly on into this episode but\nthat's dual in-line memory module.\n\n76\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.174\nAll right, dual in-line memory module\nis a little bit different than the,\n\n77\n00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:36.519\nwell a lot of bit different.\n\n78\n00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.450\nIt's what we use today.\n\n79\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.128\nYou don't see the earlier\nsingle in-line memory modules,\n\n80\n00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:43.516\nthey were called SIMMs back in the day.\n\n81\n00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:46.310\nThese are 64 bits slots all right?\n\n82\n00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.258\nNow, SO-DIMM,\n\n83\n00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:51.760\nSO-DIMM is interesting because SO-DIMM\nis a different type of form factor.\n\n84\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.499\nAnd really SO-DIMM stands for\nsmall outline,\n\n85\n00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.592\ndual in-line memory module, right?\n\n86\n00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:01.252\nYou might hear it called S-O DIMM or\nSODIMM,\n\n87\n00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:03.780\ndon't let that jargon fool you in any way.\n\n88\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.861\nIt's just S-O DIMM, if you will.\n\n89\n00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.810\nIn fact, I can show you a SO-DIMM module,\nnot the actual slot,\n\n90\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.090\nthat's what we find in our laptops.\n\n91\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.140\nSmaller form factor.\n\n92\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.638\nWhat they do is rather\nthan use the long module,\n\n93\n00:04:17.638 --> 00:04:20.580\nimagine just cutting it right in half,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.410\nI think about, was it John Belushi,\nsamurai warrior.\n\n95\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.310\nAnd we're gonna go ahead,\njust cut that module right in half and\n\n96\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.060\nwe're gonna stack them on each other,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.320\nSo it's half the size and\nwe can install it in a laptop.\n\n98\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.222\nCuz you gotta keep in mind, in a laptop\nyou don't have a lot of space, right?\n\n99\n00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:38.320\nIt's a very thin case, right,\nnot a lot of stacking diameter.\n\n100\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.890\nSo, we really couldn't\nfit the full size DIMM.\n\n101\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.670\nSo let me show you here on our computer\nhere, I've got a SO-DIMM module,\n\n102\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.341\nand notice that it isn't eight chips wide,\nright?\n\n103\n00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.640\nIts four chips stat.\n\n104\n00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.710\nSo it's half the size, right?\n\n105\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.560\nAnd I do want you to remember that for\nthe exam,\n\n106\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.900\nthat SO-DIMMs are the small outline\ndual in-line memory modules.\n\n107\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.405\nAgain just a half the size that you would\nfind in laptops, versus the full size\n\n108\n00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:11.290\nDIMMs if you will that are found on\nthe motherboards themselves, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.410\nSo that's a little bit about what\nSO-DIMM and DIMM are, if you will.\n\n110\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.810\nNow the next thing that we have to\nlook at are some different standards.\n\n111\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.990\nAnd when we look at standards I want you\nguys to keep in mind that there are a ton\n\n112\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.400\nof different naming conventions out here,\nall right?\n\n113\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.861\nBut the first type that we're gonna talk\nabout is what is known as DDR, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:39.758\nDDR is something known double data rate,\nall right?\n\n115\n00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:42.580\nNow I wanna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take a trip back in time.\n\n116\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.785\nWe're gonna get in our DeLorean\nwith old Doc Brown and\n\n117\n00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.458\nwe're gonna go back to the future here.\n\n118\n00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:50.116\nAnd what I'd like to mention is\nthe fact that that in the earlier days,\n\n119\n00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.290\nwe had things like EDO RAM going way back.\n\n120\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.970\nAnd then we had what was known as DRAM,\nright?\n\n121\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.370\nYou have SRAM,\nwhich is static random access memory.\n\n122\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.860\nThis is a memory type that's\nfound in things like CPUs.\n\n123\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.060\nAnd what is means is that,\nwhen you turn off the power\n\n124\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.280\nIt doesn't lose the information in it,\nkind of like non-volatile memory.\n\n125\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.281\nBut then DRAM is dynamic\nrandom access memory.\n\n126\n00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:17.640\nIt's dynamic in the fact that you can\nuse any part of the memory at one time.\n\n127\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.320\nAny part of that memory could\nbe accessed at any given point.\n\n128\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.760\nAnd those earlier DRAM modules\nweren't really the most efficient.\n\n129\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.360\nSo what they did is as we go forward in\nhistory now, they said, you know what?\n\n130\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.110\nLet's go ahead and\nwe can make it more efficient by\n\n131\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.785\nsynchronizing the RAM with the clock\ncycle of the CPU, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:39.660\nAnd what I mean by that is that,\nor the clock speed of the CPU.\n\n133\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.360\nThink about the clock speed has\nbeing the heartbeat, right?\n\n134\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.960\nThe heartbeat of the CPU, right?\n\n135\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.410\nAnd we can synchronize the access\ntimes with the heartbeat of that CPU.\n\n136\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.760\nAnd that gave rise to what was known as,\nand this is not called out on the exam,\n\n137\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.670\nso don't worry about this, but\nit's good to know where we came from and\n\n138\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.210\nwhere we're going.\n\n139\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.690\nIt might help you out,\njust with your understanding.\n\n140\n00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.598\nThey came out with what was known as\nsynchronous dynamic random access memory,\n\n141\n00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:02.192\nall right?\n\n142\n00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:05.968\nNow the reason I mention all of that in\nthat crazy acronym is because it really\n\n143\n00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:09.685\nforms the basis for every type that would\nbe made after that, that we use for\n\n144\n00:07:09.685 --> 00:07:12.000\nour system memory or\nour main memory, right?\n\n145\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.710\nSo when I say DDR.\n\n146\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.353\nDDR, double data rate, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:22.775\nAnd it's technically the long\ndrawn on acronym as DDR SD RAM or\n\n148\n00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:27.210\ndouble data rate synchronous\ndynamic random access memory.\n\n149\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.090\nSo you could see that it forms\nthe basis for everything after that.\n\n150\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.750\nSo what does double data rate mean?\n\n151\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.650\nIt just means now you have double\nthe data rate over the earlier\n\n152\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.100\nsynchronous dynamic random access memory.\n\n153\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.150\nNow there are some characteristics that\nI want you to know of that, right.\n\n154\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:49.113\nIn the earlier SDRAM days,\nWhat we would have, we have pins, right?\n\n155\n00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:50.894\nWe have pins that are on our RAM modules.\n\n156\n00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:55.004\nAnd it, for the exam, it's gonna be\nimportant to know pins, cuz again they\n\n157\n00:07:55.004 --> 00:07:58.685\nwant to know if you can prove that\nyou understand the lingo, right?\n\n158\n00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:00.597\nLet me show you what I\nmean here when I say pins.\n\n159\n00:08:00.597 --> 00:08:03.166\nI'm really just talking about\nthese electrical contacts.\n\n160\n00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:07.186\nNow I certainly don't expect you out in\nthe real world to count everyone of these\n\n161\n00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:07.911\npins, okay.\n\n162\n00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.883\nSo understand that this is\nsomething that's for the exam.\n\n163\n00:08:08.883 --> 00:08:11.104\n&gt;&gt; There's 25 of them.\n\n164\n00:08:11.104 --> 00:08:11.632\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:08:11.632 --> 00:08:12.133\n&gt;&gt; Only kidding.\n\n166\n00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:12.746\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say.\n\n167\n00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:13.247\n&gt;&gt; Only kidding.\n\n168\n00:08:13.247 --> 00:08:14.562\n&gt;&gt; I'd be surprise if you were actually\n\n169\n00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:15.374\nright there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:17.013\n&gt;&gt; I would say, you're hired.\n\n171\n00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:18.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, keep in mind that when it comes\n\n172\n00:08:18.923 --> 00:08:23.240\nto the pins themselves, this is more\nimportant for the certification.\n\n173\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.323\nThe SDRAM chips would have 168 pins.\n\n174\n00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:28.580\nThis is what I want you to know for\nthe test, right?\n\n175\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.155\nDDR, double data rate.\n\n176\n00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:37.310\nDouble data rate has 184 pins on\nthe memory module itself, all right?\n\n177\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:44.319\nNow, and let me also mention too,\nDDR came out in 2000, right?\n\n178\n00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:48.670\nHere we are in 2017, so its relatively\nold, its a legacy technology, pretty much.\n\n179\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.730\nWhen I say legacy,\nits just kinda outdated, right?\n\n180\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:58.730\nWell that as CPUs increase their speed,\nincrease their computational power,\n\n181\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.340\nwe couldn't pump enough information\ninto them to keep the CPU busy.\n\n182\n00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.470\nSo what do they do?\n\n183\n00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.190\nA little corporation called JEDEC\nwhich oversees all of these standards,\n\n184\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.700\nthe DDR standards, if you will.\n\n185\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.460\nAnd that's the JEDEC solid state\ntechnology association is what they're\n\n186\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.180\ncalled today.\n\n187\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.369\nThey used to be called the joint\nelectronic division or\n\n188\n00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:18.568\nsomething like that but\nthey've changed their name.\n\n189\n00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:21.720\nJEDEC is the one that\noversees the DDR standards.\n\n190\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.940\nThey said, okay, well,\nwe're gonna come out with DDR2, all right.\n\n191\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.652\nWell, that's double data rate 2.\n\n192\n00:09:27.652 --> 00:09:28.420\nAnd what does it do?\n\n193\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.180\nIt doubles the data rate\nover the earlier DDR, right?\n\n194\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.970\nSo, you could see again,\na doubling of the data rate.\n\n195\n00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.420\nNow, the other thing that's great about,\nas these memories progressed,\n\n196\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.400\nyou're also seeing lower\nvoltage requirements too.\n\n197\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.685\nAnd that is a good thing, right,\n\n198\n00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.745\nmore power efficient cuz keep in mind\nthe more power you pump across that\n\n199\n00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:51.168\nmotherboard, the more likely you are to\nhave electromagnetic interference.\n\n200\n00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:53.580\nRight, and that is really the give and\n\n201\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.250\ntake with speeding up the communications\nthat we have across the motherboard.\n\n202\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.590\nYeah, I can increase all the voltage I\nwant, but I also increase the bleed over\n\n203\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.430\nof electromagnetic interference,\nso it's kind of a give and take.\n\n204\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.370\nAnd that was one of the good\nthings about DDR2, is that, yes,\n\n205\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.410\nit did double the data rate, but it also\nlowered the voltage requirements too.\n\n206\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.868\nNow DDR2 came out in 2003.\n\n207\n00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:16.190\nI don't think you have to worry about\nthat on the exam, when it came out,\n\n208\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.340\nbut just to kinda give you the timeline\nof where we're going here.\n\n209\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.040\nAgain, we're kinda taking\na trip through history here.\n\n210\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.940\n&gt;&gt; Wes, we all appreciate it too,\nthe history is awesome.\n\n211\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.637\nI mean it gives us that good background.\n\n212\n00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:28.900\nAnd because this is on tape,\nyou can watch it whenever.\n\n213\n00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.420\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n214\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.370\n&gt;&gt; Digital tape, by the way.\n\n215\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Digital tape, that's right.\n\n216\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.690\nWe wanna make sure that you\ndo have that information.\n\n217\n00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.458\nNow, here's again another\nspecification for the exam.\n\n218\n00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.903\nAgain, after we talk\nabout the specifications,\n\n219\n00:10:40.903 --> 00:10:45.507\nI'll tell you how you match the RAM,\nand know what you need to buy.\n\n220\n00:10:45.507 --> 00:10:50.450\nDDR 2, 240 pins, all right.\n\n221\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.854\nSo we went for 184 for DDR,\nwe went 240, if you will for DDR2.\n\n222\n00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:57.810\nAll right, now the success over that.\n\n223\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.380\nI can only imagine that we're\ngoing the sequential numbers here.\n\n224\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.170\nCan you take a guess?\n\n225\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.090\n&gt;&gt; It would be DDR3.\n\n226\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:03.697\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n227\n00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:06.329\nWhat do we have for them,\nJohnny, behind door number one.\n\n228\n00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:09.020\nThat's right, it's DDR3.\n\n229\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.303\nNow DDR3, again, we're in 2017,\nit came out in 2007.\n\n230\n00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:18.148\nAll right, in 2007,\nthey released JEDEC released the DDR3,\n\n231\n00:11:18.148 --> 00:11:22.630\nand it doubles the data rate\nover the predecessor, right?\n\n232\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.760\nAnd it also lowers the power\nrequirements yet again.\n\n233\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.540\nNow, here's gonna be the kicker, right?\n\n234\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.520\nGuess how many pins are in a DDR3 module?\n\n235\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.649\n240, now you're gonna say,\nwell wait a second, Wes,\n\n236\n00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:39.448\nwe've got DDR2 has got 240 pins,\nand DDR3 has got 240 pins.\n\n237\n00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.310\nSo they must be backwards compatible.\n\n238\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.050\nNo, they're not.\n\n239\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.960\nBecause the notch positions on the RAM\nmodules themselves are in different\n\n240\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.190\npositions, they are not compatible.\n\n241\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.230\nThey aren't compatible with one another.\n\n242\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.820\nSo I do want you to keep that in mind.\n\n243\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.434\nSo those are the three standards that\nare on the exam that I want you to know.\n\n244\n00:11:57.434 --> 00:12:01.248\nBut I wanna go a little bit farther, and\nsee if I can take some time to eliminate\n\n245\n00:12:01.248 --> 00:12:04.130\na little bit of confusion here for\nyou, all right?\n\n246\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:10.060\nAnd that's because JEDEC cause them DDR,\nright?\n\n247\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.680\nBut I want you to see, how you identify\nthe RAM itself sometimes on the packaging.\n\n248\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.710\nSo we've got a couple of RAM packages\nright here, and we went ahead and\n\n249\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.160\nleft this stickers up, so\nyou guys can see this stickers.\n\n250\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.530\nNow, and if we can look down here at the\nstickers, I know it's kinda hard to see\n\n251\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.030\nnow, but you're gonna see some\ninformation on these, right.\n\n252\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.944\nSo notice that right here,\nI don't see anything about DDR, but\n\n253\n00:12:32.944 --> 00:12:36.136\nwhat I do see is this crazy, what is that?\n\n254\n00:12:36.136 --> 00:12:41.653\nThat's a PC3, and\nI think it's 10,600, right.\n\n255\n00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:43.040\nWell, what is that about?\n\n256\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.238\nWell, boy, is that confusing?\n\n257\n00:12:44.238 --> 00:12:47.925\nAll right, well let's go ahead and let's\ntalk a little bit about that, all right.\n\n258\n00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:48.810\nWhat does that mean?\n\n259\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.520\nAll right, well,\nJEDEC is the standardize body.\n\n260\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.230\nRight there, the standardize body that\nover see the memory specifications.\n\n261\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:02.720\nHowever, manufactures, they manufacture\ntheir RAM to the JEDEC standard,\n\n262\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.810\nbut they name the modules themselves\ndifferent than what the standard is.\n\n263\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.190\nThey're one on the same, and\nthey're really confusing.\n\n264\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.205\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n265\n00:13:10.205 --> 00:13:12.580\nI got a little diagram\nhere on the computer here.\n\n266\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.070\nAnd JEDEC,\n\n267\n00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.351\nall right, they're the ones that come\nout with something like DDR-200, right?\n\n268\n00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:21.785\nDDR-200, if you will,\nis the standard, right?\n\n269\n00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:24.670\nBut the module name is\na little bit different, right?\n\n270\n00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.680\nThe module name is PC-1600.\n\n271\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.700\nWhat does that mean?\n\n272\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.071\nOr in this case, right,\nwe've got DDR3-800, right?\n\n273\n00:13:33.071 --> 00:13:37.438\nAnd you could see that on the module\nthat we showed you, it said PC3, and\n\n274\n00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:39.880\nit said 10,600, right?\n\n275\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.660\nWell that's because the module name is\nbased on the transfer rate, all right?\n\n276\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.760\nNot the standard, if you will, right?\n\n277\n00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.472\nThe module name is based on what\nthe transfer rate is in megabyte, so\n\n278\n00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:58.620\nyou could see PC3 means 6,400\nmegabytes in a given second.\n\n279\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.545\nSo I want you to understand that, that is\npretty much what's going on there, and\n\n280\n00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:06.250\nthere's a small calculation that you can\ndo if you ever need to figure this out.\n\n281\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.230\nAnd I'm gonna probably try my math here,\nand you guys can write this down at home,\n\n282\n00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.007\nI'm not really gonna go through\nwriting this down here.\n\n283\n00:14:13.007 --> 00:14:14.850\nBut if they ever gave\nit to you on the exam,\n\n284\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.200\nI'm not sure it's gonna be important but\ncan help you out, nonetheless.\n\n285\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.100\nSo for instance, if you know DDR3-800, and\n\n286\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.360\nwe said it's PC3-600,\nif I take the clock speed, right,\n\n287\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.410\nthe hertz, if you will,\nof the RAM itself, and\n\n288\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:38.060\nI multiply it by its data rate, in this\ncase, it's triple that rate, right?\n\n289\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.628\nBasically, or double data rate, right?\n\n290\n00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:45.980\nSo I could take the clock speed, multiply\nit by two, if you will, multiply that\n\n291\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:51.253\nnumber by 64, and then divide it by eight,\nand I get what the PC module is named.\n\n292\n00:14:51.253 --> 00:14:53.466\nAll right, so\nlet me try my calculations here.\n\n293\n00:14:53.466 --> 00:14:56.260\nAnd again,\nI'm not trying to confuse anybody, but\n\n294\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.715\nI know that the standards in\nthe past have been confusing.\n\n295\n00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:00.945\nLet's figure it out.\n\n296\n00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:03.365\nI'll throw myself right\nunder the bus here.\n\n297\n00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:07.975\nWe'll open up a Notepad here,\nand let's go ahead,\n\n298\n00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:11.030\nand get something going here, right.\n\n299\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.620\nSo, we'll take and\nlet me go ahead increase this font size.\n\n300\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.720\nYou probably should have done that\nbefore the show, I do apologize.\n\n301\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:23.057\nAll right, and let's say, for instance\nright, we've got DDR and it's DDR-200.\n\n302\n00:15:23.057 --> 00:15:28.370\nRight, well, how would we figure out what\nthe PC module name would be for that?\n\n303\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.304\nWell, we're gonna go ahead, and we're\ngonna take whatever the clock speed is,\n\n304\n00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:35.286\nright, so I know and\nyou can look these up, the clock speeds.\n\n305\n00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:41.850\nI know DDR-200 is 100\nmegahertz clock speed, right.\n\n306\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.570\nSo I'm gonna start with that clock speed.\n\n307\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.220\nIt's double data rate, and we're gonna\nmultiply that times two, all right.\n\n308\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.081\nNow these are 64 bit modules.\n\n309\n00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:56.106\nSo we take that number, and\nthen we multiply it times 64, right?\n\n310\n00:15:56.106 --> 00:15:58.922\nAnd then at the end,\nsince there a byte is 8 bits,\n\n311\n00:15:58.922 --> 00:16:03.231\nwe're gonna in the end we're gonna divide,\noops, if I can do divide here.\n\n312\n00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:08.568\nWe're gonna divide by 8, all right.\n\n313\n00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:14.020\nNow, let me go ahead and see my math here,\nif we can do this right.\n\n314\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.130\nAll right, so let's go ahead, and\nyeah, we'll do this right here.\n\n315\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.150\nSo we've got our numbers here.\n\n316\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.330\nClock speed is 200, or\n100 megahertz, right.\n\n317\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.500\nSo, If we take 100,\noops let me see if I can do that.\n\n318\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.800\nIf we take 100 and\nwe multiply that by 2, right?\n\n319\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.060\nOur double data rate.\n\n320\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.130\nThat gives us what?\n\n321\n00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:34.813\n200, right?\n\n322\n00:16:34.813 --> 00:16:40.083\nAnd we take that 200 and we multiply\n\n323\n00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:45.040\nit then by 64 and we get 1280.\n\n324\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.920\nAnd then we divide that by 8, equals 1600.\n\n325\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.160\nAnd if you notice the module names here,\nwe have PC-1600.\n\n326\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.880\nNow, like I said I'm not sure if\nthey'll get into the specifications,\n\n327\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.410\nthat specific on the exam, but\n\n328\n00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.880\nthat's how you can always figure out\nif you have a DDR standard, right?\n\n329\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.600\nWhat's the module name, right?\n\n330\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.850\nWhat would the associated module name.\n\n331\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.760\nSo don't let that confuse you and\n\n332\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.740\nagain I don't know if they'll get\nthat specific on the exam itself but\n\n333\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.330\nit is important to understand that\nthere are different naming conventions.\n\n334\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.790\nJadek names the standard because\nthey oversee the specifications.\n\n335\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.260\nThe manufacturers make the modules\nthat the specifications adhere to.\n\n336\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.020\nAnd of course like anything in\ncomputing they are gonna use something\n\n337\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.550\nslightly different.\n\n338\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.570\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe main things we have to do.\n\n339\n00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.118\nNow, there is one last module\nthat I do wanna talk about and\n\n340\n00:17:37.118 --> 00:17:38.684\nthat's the SO-DIMM, all right?\n\n341\n00:17:38.684 --> 00:17:42.725\nAnd there are some pin arrangements\nthat I want you to be aware of\n\n342\n00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:46.872\nwhen it comes to the small outline\ndual-inline memory module.\n\n343\n00:17:46.872 --> 00:17:50.310\nI wouldn't worry too much of\nwhether they are DDR, DDR2,\n\n344\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.540\nDDR3, I am gonna give you\nsome examples anyways but\n\n345\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.650\nagain I want you to remember the pin\noutages, if they happen to ask you.\n\n346\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.230\nAll right, for DDR and SO-DIMM, right,\n\n347\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:05.060\na Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory\nModule, that's put into a laptop.\n\n348\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:10.420\nIf it was DDR, Double Data Rate,\nit'd be 144 pins, all right?\n\n349\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.540\nIf it was DDR2, double the data rate,\nright, it's gonna be 200 pins.\n\n350\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.460\nDDR3 if you will, is gonna be 204 pins.\n\n351\n00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:27.050\nNow, the thing to keep in mind here\nis that how do we identify RAM,\n\n352\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.988\nhow do we identify what we need for\nthe motherboard?\n\n353\n00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:35.793\nIf we can take a look at that zoomed in,\nof our RAM here modules.\n\n354\n00:18:35.793 --> 00:18:37.620\nThank you very much.\n\n355\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.768\nNow if you look here,\nnotice that it says PC3 16 or\n\n356\n00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:46.980\n10,600, I do have that somewhere,\n\n357\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.201\nthat's actually DTR3 1333 memory.\n\n358\n00:18:51.201 --> 00:18:54.520\nAnd again that's just because of\nthat calculation I was showing you.\n\n359\n00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.290\nWell do I have to count the pins?\n\n360\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.738\nAnd then count the pins\non the motherboard, no.\n\n361\n00:18:58.738 --> 00:19:01.832\nWhat I do is I look at\nthe motherboard specifications,\n\n362\n00:19:01.832 --> 00:19:04.010\nwhat does it say that it needs?\n\n363\n00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.330\nAnd then I look at the RAM module or\nI go out and\n\n364\n00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.440\nI buy the RAM that it says\nthe motherboard needs.\n\n365\n00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.250\nI don't worry about the pins\nin the real world, okay guys?\n\n366\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:16.332\nSo understand that part of this is\nreally for the certification exam and\n\n367\n00:19:16.332 --> 00:19:20.410\nagain proving that you know\nwhat the technology is.\n\n368\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.960\nWhen it comes down to it, and you're gonna\nupgrade your RAM, you're gonna install\n\n369\n00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.290\nRAM, or maybe you're building\na computer for the first time, right?\n\n370\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.958\nThat just means that you look at the\nmotherboard, the motherboard is gonna say,\n\n371\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:35.390\nit takes DDR3 2133 RAM, right?\n\n372\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.512\nWell, guess what I'm gonna do.\n\n373\n00:19:36.512 --> 00:19:41.140\nI'm gonna go to the company that sells\nram, NewEgg, or maybe I'll go to\n\n374\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.300\nTiger Direct, or maybe you could\nwrite to Course Air, or Kingston, and\n\n375\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:51.390\nyou're gonna say okay, let me look through\nhere and find DDR3 2133 RAM, right?\n\n376\n00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.530\nIf it ends up\n\n377\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.650\nsaying something like DDR3, PC3-1700,\nwe'll notice that that's the same thing.\n\n378\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.960\nYou just match whatever\nthe standard the mother board says\n\n379\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.660\nup with the RAM itself and\nyou should be good.\n\n380\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.230\n&gt;&gt; How can you determine what's\nthe max RAM your system can handle?.\n\n381\n00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.665\nBesides looking at the side of the box.\n\n382\n00:20:12.665 --> 00:20:14.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n383\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.920\nLet's talk about maximums, here, because\nwe haven't got into the operating system\n\n384\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.230\nbut I'm glad that you've asked that Zack.\n\n385\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.758\nBecause we have 32 bit operating systems,\n\n386\n00:20:21.758 --> 00:20:25.955\nactually it's hardware in the operating\nsystem combined, so hardware.\n\n387\n00:20:25.955 --> 00:20:30.708\nWe've got 32 bit architecture and\nwe have 64 bit architecture, right?\n\n388\n00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:31.972\nHere's the thing.\n\n389\n00:20:31.972 --> 00:20:36.600\nWith 32 bits,\ncomputing is all about binary math, so\n\n390\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.951\n2 to the power of whatever the bits are.\n\n391\n00:20:39.951 --> 00:20:47.065\nIn this case 2 to the power of 32,\ngives you 4.294 billion combinations.\n\n392\n00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:49.044\nJust under 4.3 billion combinations.\n\n393\n00:20:49.044 --> 00:20:50.186\n&gt;&gt; Was that quick math?\n\n394\n00:20:50.186 --> 00:20:52.580\n&gt;&gt; That's quick math.\n\n395\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.640\n&gt;&gt; If you take that into what it means.\n\n396\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.887\nThat means that a 32-bit architecture and\n\n397\n00:20:58.887 --> 00:21:04.878\nby association the operating system that\nruns on it can only address 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n398\n00:21:04.878 --> 00:21:08.000\n32 bit architecture,\nthat's it, that's all you get,\n\n399\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.260\n4 gigs, you don't get anything\nmore than that, all right?\n\n400\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.935\nNow I'm not even gonna try 2 to the 64th\npower, I think it's like 16 eggs of bytes.\n\n401\n00:21:16.935 --> 00:21:18.885\nPotential memory bytes if you could.\n\n402\n00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:21.712\nJust massive amounts,\nwe don't have motherboards outside of\n\n403\n00:21:21.712 --> 00:21:24.657\nthings like clusters that really\nsupport that amount of memory.\n\n404\n00:21:24.657 --> 00:21:29.405\nSo in a 64-bit machine,\nyou can have all the memory you want.\n\n405\n00:21:29.405 --> 00:21:31.600\nUh-uh, sorry.\n\n406\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.356\nManufacturers limit you.\n\n407\n00:21:32.356 --> 00:21:34.407\nAnd why do they limit you?\n\n408\n00:21:34.407 --> 00:21:37.672\nLike we talked about in our motherboard\nepisode, and if you're not familiar with\n\n409\n00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:40.550\nthat, go back, the limiting factor\nis typically the manufacturer.\n\n410\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.680\nThey will have motherboards\nthat have different\n\n411\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.840\namounts of memory based\non various price points.\n\n412\n00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.380\nIt's not uncommon to see\nmotherboards that even basically,\n\n413\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.440\nthey start out with 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n414\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.400\nBut you have to pay attention to\nthe specifications of the motherboard.\n\n415\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.700\nBecause just because I have four\nRAM DIMM slots on the motherboard\n\n416\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.410\ndoesn't mean I can put eight,\neight or four eight gig sticks in it.\n\n417\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.760\nSo 4 times 8, 24 gigs of RAM.\n\n418\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.010\nCuz the motherboard itself might only\naddress 16 gigs, regardless of its 64 bit.\n\n419\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.540\nAgain, that's a limitation that\nthe motherboard manufacturers put.\n\n420\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.190\nAnd it gives them the ability,\nagain, to vary their price points.\n\n421\n00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:24.050\nYou want just the basic run\nyour mill compact card?\n\n422\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.470\nThat's what you can afford?\n\n423\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.090\nWell, they allow you to do that.\n\n424\n00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.900\nRight, but if you're the gamer,\nyou probably want the gaudy, right?\n\n425\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.080\nYou probably want that Lamborghini and\n\n426\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.610\nyou can see things where they\nhave motherboards give you 64,\n\n427\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.250\nI've seen some that are just massive, that\nhave almost up to 96 gigs of RAM on them.\n\n428\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.500\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n429\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.550\n&gt;&gt; It's like one massive RAM slot to\nRAM slot across the entire board.\n\n430\n00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.800\nBut, pay attention to\nthe quantity of the module.\n\n431\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.990\nIt might say, for instance, in fact if\nwe could, I could show you this here.\n\n432\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.620\nIf we could zoom back into that.\n\n433\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.780\nThank you there.\n\n434\n00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.450\nNotice that this says 2 gig, right?\n\n435\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.750\nIt says 2 gigabyte.\n\n436\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.660\nThat's letting me know that\nthis module of RAM right\n\n437\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.240\nhere with these collective chips,\nit by itself is 2 gigs.\n\n438\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.820\nYou have sticks out there, and\nthese are kind of old today but\n\n439\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.700\nthere are 1 gig, you have 2 gig,\nyou have 4 gig, and I've even seen 8 gig.\n\n440\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.640\nSo that means that if I had four RAM\nslots and the motherboard supports it,\n\n441\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:26.488\nI could put 8 or 4, yeah four 8 gig sticks\nand that would give me 24 gigs of ram.\n\n442\n00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:27.990\nAll right but\n\n443\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.180\npay attention to what the motherboard\nsays cuz that doesn't necessarily mean\n\n444\n00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.440\nthat just because the slots are there that\nyou're gonna actually see all of that RAM.\n\n445\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.500\nYou don't wanna go out and\nspend money on 24 gigs of RAM and\n\n446\n00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.140\nyou can absolutely install it but your\nmotherboard's only gonna address 16 gigs.\n\n447\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Now, I know we touched on\nbuffered versus non-buffered.\n\n448\n00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.645\nDo you wanna go back to that or\nare we [CROSSTALK]\n\n449\n00:23:46.645 --> 00:23:48.140\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we covered that.\n\n450\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:48.760\n&gt;&gt; I think we did too.\n\n451\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.440\nSo, how about ROM types.\n\n452\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.290\nDifferent ROM types?\n\n453\n00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.643\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question and\nthat's another thing that I'd like to,\n\n454\n00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:59.790\nit really isn't called here on\nthe exam here in these objectives.\n\n455\n00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:04.846\nBut guys you really need to know about it,\nyou need to know what, I mean\n\n456\n00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:11.215\nif we're talking about ROM let's go ahead\nAnd let's talk about ROM types, all right.\n\n457\n00:24:11.215 --> 00:24:15.322\nNow, first of all, I got a little\ndiagram here, and what is ROM?\n\n458\n00:24:15.322 --> 00:24:18.650\nRead-only memory, right.\n\n459\n00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.310\nYou might hear it called\nsometimes BIOS memory.\n\n460\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:25.840\nIt's non-volatile, and\ntoday it's electrically programmable.\n\n461\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.250\nIn the old days, sometimes you could\nremove the ROM chips and stuff.\n\n462\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.680\nAnd some, this is going way back,\nyou couldn't remove them at all.\n\n463\n00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.090\nBut notice that these chips\nare soldered into the motherboard and\n\n464\n00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.210\nthat's typically what they are today.\n\n465\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.030\nHowever, ROM,\nwe have a few different kinds.\n\n466\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.250\nWe have what's known as the oldest kind,\n\n467\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.820\nwhich was known as\nprogrammable read-only memory.\n\n468\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.480\nWe have electrically, no,\nI'm sorry, we have EPROM.\n\n469\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.660\nEPROM was erasable\nprogrammable read-only memory.\n\n470\n00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.380\nAnd what we use today is EEPROM.\n\n471\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.260\nThat's electrically erasable\nprogrammable read-only memory.\n\n472\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.120\nBoy, a whole bunch of jargon,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n473\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.450\nAll right, well, in the earlier days,\n\n474\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.710\nremember what we said that\nBIOS memory does, right?\n\n475\n00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.730\nIn that ROM chip, it retains\nthe manufacturer's defined settings for\n\n476\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.580\nbringing the hardware online.\n\n477\n00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.440\nYou customize your settings and those\ncustomized settings are stored in CMOS,\n\n478\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.760\nwhich we have a little\nbattery that refreshes.\n\n479\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.766\nNow, in those earlier days,\nthose PROM chips would come in and\n\n480\n00:25:16.766 --> 00:25:19.046\nyou couldn't do any programming,\nall right?\n\n481\n00:25:19.046 --> 00:25:23.135\nYou couldn't do any programming because,\nthe way that they would program them,\n\n482\n00:25:23.135 --> 00:25:26.572\nbinary ones and zeros,\neverything's ones and zeros in computing,\n\n483\n00:25:26.572 --> 00:25:30.150\nis essentially what they do is\nthey burn a diode out, right?\n\n484\n00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.400\nAnd they'd leave a diode, burn a diode,\nand it would forms the ones and zeros.\n\n485\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.500\nBut it's kind of like, say I've got\na series of light bulbs, right?\n\n486\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.600\nIf I look at the light bulbs and\nthey're on, off, on and off,\n\n487\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.720\ndon't worry about the fact\nthat they're off.\n\n488\n00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.930\nI break the light bulb, that's off, right.\n\n489\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.360\nBut I can't replace it.\n\n490\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.940\nSo they were programmable\nonce by the manufacturer.\n\n491\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.330\nWell, what happens if you\nneeded an update, right.\n\n492\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.300\nWell if you needed an update,\n\n493\n00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.830\na lot of times you'd have to send\nit back to the manufacturer.\n\n494\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:26:01.190\nAnd they could program it or you could\npotentially just upgrade your motherboard.\n\n495\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.970\nDown the way they found out that,\nhey, how about we\n\n496\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:10.290\nuse ROM chips that\nare sensitive to a UV light?\n\n497\n00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.510\nAnd really what happened was it's\ncalled the floating gate transistor.\n\n498\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.664\nAnd don't even worry [LAUGH]\ntoo much about this.\n\n499\n00:26:14.664 --> 00:26:15.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It just means\n\n500\n00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:20.208\nthat we have a transistor that can move up\nand down and it's reactive to UV light.\n\n501\n00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:24.372\nSo the erasable programmable read-only\nmemory chips were the ones that you could\n\n502\n00:26:24.372 --> 00:26:27.520\nactually flash with a UV light\nthat have a little lens in them.\n\n503\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.330\nAnd it would reset the ROM,\nand it could be reprogrammed.\n\n504\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.460\nThat's why it's called erasable\nprogrammable read-only memory.\n\n505\n00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.210\nBut even that wasn't efficient.\n\n506\n00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.950\nAnd what we do today when we do firmware\nupdates, we call it flashing the BIOS.\n\n507\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.740\nWhy do we call it flashing the BIOS?\n\n508\n00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.750\nWell, it kinda emanates from\nthat flashing the UV light.\n\n509\n00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:45.940\nBut the difference is,\n\n510\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.510\nthose floating gate transistors today\nare reactive to electrical current.\n\n511\n00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.300\nSo rather than have to\nflash them with a UV light,\n\n512\n00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.490\nyou can send an electrical current\non a trace on the motherboard,\n\n513\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.870\nright across the motherboard,\nand it programs it.\n\n514\n00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.010\nAnd we don't have to remove our chips,\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n515\n00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.450\nAnd I do want to make mention\nthat be careful, all right?\n\n516\n00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.712\nAny time you upgrade BIOS,\nyou'll hear firmware updates, right?\n\n517\n00:27:08.712 --> 00:27:12.380\nThis is the flashing of that ROM chip.\n\n518\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.969\nIf you interrupt that\nflashing of that memory,\n\n519\n00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:19.926\nyou might permanently ruin the device,\nall right?\n\n520\n00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:23.020\nSo don't flash your BIOS, if you will.\n\n521\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.025\nDon't reprogram with a firmware\nupdate during things like\n\n522\n00:27:26.025 --> 00:27:28.010\na potential of an electrical storm.\n\n523\n00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:33.280\nWhen your power supply isn't\nplugged into the wall on a laptop.\n\n524\n00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.350\nWhen you run the risk of losing power or\ninterrupting that process.\n\n525\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.380\nThat is something that is very,\nvery important.\n\n526\n00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.901\n&gt;&gt; Can you combine different\nRAM inside the same unit,\n\n527\n00:27:43.901 --> 00:27:47.320\ndifferent types of RAM\ninside the same unit?\n\n528\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.885\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no.\n\n529\n00:27:48.885 --> 00:27:49.806\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Did you like that answer [LAUGH]?\n\n530\n00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it, it's good.\n\n531\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.966\nAmbiguously is nice.\n\n532\n00:27:51.966 --> 00:27:56.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's talk about the no first,\nright?\n\n533\n00:27:56.868 --> 00:27:58.749\nLet's get the pessimistic side out first.\n\n534\n00:27:58.749 --> 00:28:02.813\nECC memory and non-ECC memory,\nlike we talked about in the first episode,\n\n535\n00:28:02.813 --> 00:28:04.220\ncannot be mixed, right?\n\n536\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.040\nIf you have an ECC motherboard that\nrecognizes error correcting code,\n\n537\n00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.945\nit's going to have to have ECC memory.\n\n538\n00:28:09.945 --> 00:28:15.230\nNon-ECC memory boards, expect to have\nnon-error correcting code memory.\n\n539\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.360\nYou cannot mix and match in these boards.\n\n540\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.596\nSo that's the no part.\n\n541\n00:28:19.596 --> 00:28:20.740\nStandards, all right?\n\n542\n00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:26.640\nDDR3 doesn't fit in a DDR2 board versus\nthe legacy DDR all the way back.\n\n543\n00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.940\nNotches are in a different position,\ndifferent pin outages.\n\n544\n00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.430\nI don't even care if you're\ntalking about DDR2 and DDR3,\n\n545\n00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.400\nwhich both have 240 pins, all right?\n\n546\n00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.660\nSo that's the ugly, the bad and\nthe ugly, if you will.\n\n547\n00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.010\nLet's get back to the good.\n\n548\n00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.930\nGood is if you have a matching standard,\nright?\n\n549\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.001\nI have DDR3 memory.\n\n550\n00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:45.715\nLet's say I have 1066 memory in there,\nright, DDR3 1066.\n\n551\n00:28:45.715 --> 00:28:52.720\nAnd I say, you know what, my friend just\ngave me this good DDR3 2133 memory, right?\n\n552\n00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:59.560\nLittle bit higher of a megahertz,\na little bit faster.\n\n553\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.260\nYes, you can put that in the motherboard.\n\n554\n00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.160\nYou can mix and match.\n\n555\n00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n556\n00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.904\n&gt;&gt; But there's a performance cost, right?\n\n557\n00:29:03.904 --> 00:29:07.252\nThere's always a pro and a con.\n\n558\n00:29:07.252 --> 00:29:10.170\nThe pro is that, hey,\nI can populate and have more memory.\n\n559\n00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:15.610\nThe problem is that 2133 megahertz memory\nis gonna run at the 1066 speed, okay?\n\n560\n00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:21.450\nSo it's like saying, okay, well, I have,\nlet's go the side of the tracks, right?\n\n561\n00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.997\nLet's say we have three modules\nthat are 2133 megahertz,\n\n562\n00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:30.729\nspeed-wise, bus speed, and\nwe put a 1066 module in there.\n\n563\n00:29:30.729 --> 00:29:36.502\nNow, every one of your 2133 modules have\nnow reverted back to the slowest speed,\n\n564\n00:29:36.502 --> 00:29:39.400\nthe bottleneck, so don't mix and match.\n\n565\n00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.690\nNow, mix and match vendors if you want.\n\n566\n00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.980\nIf you like Kingston, you like Crucial,\nyou like Corsair, that's fine.\n\n567\n00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.803\nYou can mix and match vendors as long as\nit's the same standard and same speed and\n\n568\n00:29:47.803 --> 00:29:49.039\nyou don't get a performance hit.\n\n569\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.700\nWhen you talk about warranties,\nthough, you might have the blame game.\n\n570\n00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.252\nNow that was their memory that caused\nthe problem, it wasn't our memory so.\n\n571\n00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.497\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; When you're talking about warranty, or\n\n572\n00:29:57.497 --> 00:30:00.982\nyou're talking about sending\nmemory back to the manufacturer,\n\n573\n00:30:00.982 --> 00:30:04.484\nthat might cause a problem when\nyou mix and match manufacturers.\n\n574\n00:30:04.484 --> 00:30:07.940\nBut as long as you don't mix and match\nspeeds, they'll all run at the same speed.\n\n575\n00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.680\nAgain, you put a slower RAM module\nin with a faster RAM module and\n\n576\n00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.000\neverything is gonna bottleneck\nto the slowest speed.\n\n577\n00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.522\nSo just like anything else in computing,\nthere's gonna pros and cons.\n\n578\n00:30:18.522 --> 00:30:21.980\nJust make sure you pay attention to\nthe specifications of the motherboard, and\n\n579\n00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.524\nthe specifications of the memory\nthat you put in that motherboard.\n\n580\n00:30:24.524 --> 00:30:27.200\n&gt;&gt; RAM types and features,\npart two, excellent job, Wes.\n\n581\n00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.050\nThere is a part one.\n\n582\n00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.220\nYou can watch them as many times\nas you want because it's on video,\n\n583\n00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.940\nas we continue on with A+ 901.\n\n584\n00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.134\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n585\n00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:38.860\nRemember, a good IT Pro\nis always

00:00:14.741\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\nthank you for choosing IT Pro TV,\n\n4\n00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:16.778\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:21.226\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with A+901, and\n\n6\n00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:24.340\nright now we're looking\nat expansion cards.\n\n7\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.410\nWhat are expansion cards, and who's gonna\nbring us that information but Wes Bryan,\n\n8\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.010\nhey Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.526\n&gt;&gt; Hey there, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:29.180\n&gt;&gt; Hello, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.188\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're gonna be looking at\nPC expansion cards, and these are, it's\n\n12\n00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:38.800\na good functionality, it's a good thing to\nhave inside of your computing environment.\n\n13\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.410\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's kinda just define,\n\n14\n00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.270\nbasically what an expansion\ncard really is, right?\n\n15\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.810\nWell one of the things,\n\n16\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.240\nif we take the expansion card,\nwe just put that on hold for a second.\n\n17\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.330\nOne of the great things about\nmotherboards, the way they're manufactured\n\n18\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.320\ntoday is manufacturers, they vary the\nprice point of their computers that they\n\n19\n00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.160\ndeliver to you based on the level\nof functionality that you need.\n\n20\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.840\nAll right, so if you're one that's maybe\nsitting at home, and you just need to send\n\n21\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.490\nan email, maybe browse the web once in\na while, maybe check into your Facebook,\n\n22\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.070\nwell do you really need that\n$5,000- $8,000 gaming rig?\n\n23\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach would say yes, sure, and\n\n24\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.390\nmany of you might even say,\nwell absolutely I need that,\n\n25\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.120\nI need to be able to send\nthose emails very, very fast.\n\n26\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.100\nWell, if you think about it, well for some\npeople a $300 computer might be feasible.\n\n27\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.190\nHowever, what happens if you decide that\nyou need a little bit more functionality?\n\n28\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.680\nWell, if you didn't have expansion cards,\nyou're gonna have to turn around, and\n\n29\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.780\nyou'd have to go out and\nyou'd have to buy a whole new computer.\n\n30\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.920\nOr, based on your motherboard,\nyou might have to do that anyways, right?\n\n31\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.005\nSo, an expansion card, what it allows\nyou to do and the reason they call it\n\n32\n00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.180\nan expansion card, it doesn't\nstretch the computer out any more.\n\n33\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.820\nIt's not the blue handle\nmotherboard stretcher right next\n\n34\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.750\nto the sky hook, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.890\nThis is essentially a way to\nexpand the functionality, and\n\n36\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.585\nwe do that by inserting different types\nof cards into slots on the motherboard.\n\n37\n00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:06.145\nIn fact, we've got a motherboard here,\nright here.\n\n38\n00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:08.105\nAnd I can kind of show you that, right?\n\n39\n00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:12.145\nYou can see that there are some\nunpopulated slots on this motherboard.\n\n40\n00:02:12.145 --> 00:02:14.405\nAgain, remember the jargon\nI'm feeding you guys here.\n\n41\n00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:18.130\nWhen I say unpopulated, it just means that\nthere isn't anything installed, right?\n\n42\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.270\nYou could say that these memory\nmodules are populating the RAM slots\n\n43\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.630\nbecause they're there,\npresent and installed.\n\n44\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.410\nBut the great thing about this is,\nthis is a relatively low-end computer.\n\n45\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.990\nAnd you didn't have to pay\na lot of money for it, because,\n\n46\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.450\nif you needed basic functionality,\n\n47\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.800\nwell, this gives you everything you\nneed without some of the extras.\n\n48\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.770\nHowever, if you want some of the extras,\nmaybe later down the road, you can always\n\n49\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.620\nadd additional functionality by\ninstalling these cards, these\n\n50\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.550\nPC expansion cards as you call them, into\nthe different slots on the motherboard.\n\n51\n00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know that being said,\nshould you check to see if it says\n\n52\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.420\nyou can expand this, this is expandable,\nthere is that capability?\n\n53\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.740\n&gt;&gt; That's a perfect question,\n\n54\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.740\nthe fact that it all depends\non what you need, right?\n\n55\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.370\nSo, to give you an example, where I've\ndone this in the past when I'm building\n\n56\n00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.280\ncomputers is I always pay attention\nto what the customer wants, right?\n\n57\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.995\nOr pay attention, if it's a friend that\nI happen to be doing this for and say,\n\n58\n00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:20.295\nokay, what is the price point\nthat you have to spend right now?\n\n59\n00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:23.125\nAnd where do you see yourself\ngoing with this computer,\n\n60\n00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.055\nlet's say in six months or a year?\n\n61\n00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:26.365\nAnd I know they're usually outdated.\n\n62\n00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:30.290\nBut a lot of times people hold\nonto computers for a long time.\n\n63\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.790\nSo, when you're purchasing a system,\n\n64\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.810\nyou might wanna pay attention to\nthe motherboard specifications.\n\n65\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.500\nBecause the motherboard specifications,\n\n66\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.010\naccording to the manufacturer's details\nabout it, the manufacturer's specs\n\n67\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.020\ntell you how many of these expansion\nslots are available, right?\n\n68\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.640\nAnd even if you aren't populating them\nnow, if you want to upgrade in the future,\n\n69\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.950\nyou have to make sure that those\nslots are available, right?\n\n70\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.720\nBecause, if you don't have\nthose slots available,\n\n71\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.630\nthen you're not really going to expand\nthe functionality of the computer\n\n72\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.270\nat all because of the fact that\nthere's no way to expand it.\n\n73\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.090\nNow, why might you want to expand the\nfunctionality of your computer, all right?\n\n74\n00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.514\nWell, in an earlier episode we talked\nabout motherboards having integrated\n\n75\n00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.325\nfunctionality and\nnon-integrated functionality, right?\n\n76\n00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:13.570\nNon-integrated means it's\nnot present all right?\n\n77\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.310\nIn the fact I could say that I could\nsay that this motherboard that we just\n\n78\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.640\nlooked at here, doesn't have,\nthings like firewire capabilities, right?\n\n79\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.410\nIt's not present,\nit's not integrated, all right?\n\n80\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.320\nBut some integrated functionalities,\nall right, you have to keep in mind,\n\n81\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.290\ndon't perform as well as\ndedicated functionality.\n\n82\n00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.760\nAnd what I mean by that is if I\ntake a video that's integrated into\n\n83\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.640\nthe functionality of the motherboard\nthat chips up that we talked about,\n\n84\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.800\nit understands the graphical rendering,\ngreat.\n\n85\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.640\nYou don't even have to buy it.\n\n86\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.190\nIt keeps the price point down.\n\n87\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.480\nYou can watch your monitor.\n\n88\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.460\nYou can interact with your computer, but\nyou're probably not gonna play games,\n\n89\n00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.710\nlike video games,\n\n90\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.250\non a very high-level setting because\nthe integrated component doesn't do well.\n\n91\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.390\nBut if you get a dedicated card,\nwhere all of that hardware is\n\n92\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.640\nbuilt in to the functionality of that\ncard, you put it on an expansion slot.\n\n93\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.260\nNow you've really expanded\nthe functionality, right?\n\n94\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.270\nSo that might be a reason\nthat you might do that.\n\n95\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.410\nNow, there are many,\nmany different cards out there, right?\n\n96\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.780\nAnd I wanna kind of backtrack just\na little bit to our motherboard episode,\n\n97\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.540\nbecause it is contingent\non the bus architecture.\n\n98\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.690\nSo if we could take a look at\nthis motherboard here real quick,\n\n99\n00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.432\nI want you to see that there\nare different types of slots\n\n100\n00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:25.000\nhere,\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n101\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.950\n&gt;&gt; And they are not the same.\n\n102\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.720\nFor instance,\nthis is the PCI slot here, right.\n\n103\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.880\nThis PCI slot and the PCI e-slot,\nthey're not compatible with each other.\n\n104\n00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.350\nSo you have to make sure\nthat you understand, again,\n\n105\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.700\naccording to the specifications\nof the motherboard,\n\n106\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.880\nwhat bus architecture you\nhave available to you.\n\n107\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.820\nSo, for instance,\nthis is a FireWire expansion card.\n\n108\n00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.550\nRemember, I told you,\n\n109\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.980\nI said, well this computer doesn't\nhave FireWire available to it.\n\n110\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.320\nWell, now we've figured out that\nwe've got some kind of cameras.\n\n111\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.110\nZach, you were talking about some of\nthe cameras that you've seen on video\n\n112\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.620\nsystems in the past, have FireWire.\n\n113\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.280\nAnd that's just because it's one\nof the best interfaces well,\n\n114\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.170\nup until we have things.\n\n115\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.140\nWe have newer technology like Thunderbolt,\nwhich we'll talk about here, and\n\n116\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.890\nit was very good at video, right?\n\n117\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.180\nNot quite as good as like things like\nour Integrated USB ports, right?\n\n118\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.340\nWell I've got USB right here,\nbut I want Firewire.\n\n119\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.350\nUSB is not gonna,\n\n120\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.360\nit isn't really gonna give me the best\nperformance that I need for the video.\n\n121\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.270\nSo what do I do?\n\n122\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.550\nI expand the functionality of this\nmotherboard and the system unit\n\n123\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.820\ncollectively by taking this card and\nwe install it in the PCI slot.\n\n124\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.560\nAnd again, this is a PCI Firewire card.\n\n125\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.550\nAnd once you see me install it like this,\n\n126\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.690\nyou can now see that on\nthe back plan of that computer,\n\n127\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.000\non the back of the tower, I can now\nplug in our six-pin FireWire connectors.\n\n128\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.480\nRight now I have FireWire\n400 functionality that\n\n129\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.920\nI didn't have before, right?\n\n130\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.220\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings about these.\n\n131\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.280\nNow, the other thing that I might tell\nyou as well is, okay, so for instance,\n\n132\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.360\nthis is a PCI card, right, or PCIE card.\n\n133\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.850\nAnd if I just take a second here,\nand I'll pop this back out.\n\n134\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.440\nBe very careful with these guys.\n\n135\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.300\nYou'll notice that we're\nusing anti-static bags here.\n\n136\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\n\n137\n00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.100\nis it good to use the anti-static\nbags when you're actually doing this?\n\n138\n00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, because you have\nto worry about static electricity.\n\n139\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.110\nAnd we'll talk, definitely,\n\n140\n00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.040\na lot more about that in our\nelectrical safety chapter.\n\n141\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n142\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.920\n&gt;&gt; But notice that the pins\nare completely different, right?\n\n143\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.740\nNotice that they are not the same.\n\n144\n00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.080\nThese are different standards, different\narchitectures, and you have to follow.\n\n145\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.770\nPCI doesn't work with PCIe, vice versa,\nPCIe doesn't work with PCI.\n\n146\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.210\nAll right, so I could expand\nthe functionality by bringing\n\n147\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.810\nthe Firewire capabilities to this machine.\n\n148\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.320\nAlright, now one of the things\nI told you is that you can have\n\n149\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.550\nintegrated functionality\non the motherboard as well.\n\n150\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.640\nThe integrated functionality says\nthat the CPU mixed with the chip set\n\n151\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.220\nunderstands how to do\ngraphical processing.\n\n152\n00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.790\nThe CPU or the motherboard and its chip\nset are doing a lot of other things.\n\n153\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.491\nSo now it's collectively sharing its\nperformance with other devices, right.\n\n154\n00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:58.450\nSo how about getting dedicated\nfunctionality by a non-integrated\n\n155\n00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.905\ncomponent, and this more so is It's\nkinda old by today's standards here.\n\n156\n00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:07.430\nBut this is an older DVI\ntype Radeon graphics card.\n\n157\n00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.005\nAnd what I can do is I can place this into\n\n158\n00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:16.170\nthe PCI-E slot and\nnow I have a different video quality.\n\n159\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.440\nNotice that this is the old VGA\nconnector here but now I have DVI.\n\n160\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.050\nAnd this goes even more farther today,\nthey have things like your\n\n161\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.050\nthunderbolt cards out there,\nwhich are absolutely amazing.\n\n162\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.550\nAnd they will connect to your PC ie\nslots and give you things like HDMI,\n\n163\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.130\ndisplay ports of very high resolutions.\n\n164\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.930\nSo the concept is still the same.\n\n165\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.710\nNow the other thing I will\nkind of keep in mind here too\n\n166\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.710\nis notice that well that's it.\n\n167\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.420\nIf I needed more than more than\none PCI functionality well I\n\n168\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.320\nam kind of limiting myself here.\n\n169\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.450\nRight, if I needed more than 1 and\nthis happens to be a 16 lane slot here for\n\n170\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.840\nPCIe, as we talked about in\nour motherboard standards.\n\n171\n00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.950\nIf I needed more than 1 PICe,\nmaybe I needed a fast network adapter.\n\n172\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.560\nNetwork adapters will run in,\nthey'll run old PCI but\n\n173\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.440\nthey'll also run in things like\nyour PCIe for faster throughput.\n\n174\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.280\nNow I run the problem here, right.\n\n175\n00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.240\nI've expanded the functionality with PCIe,\nbut there's a problem.\n\n176\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.220\nI don't have any more slots.\n\n177\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.220\nSo, when you asked earlier\nis there a limitation,\n\n178\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.030\nthe limitation is whatever\nthe motherboard has on it.\n\n179\n00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.750\nSo that might be a a contributing factor\nto the choice that you make when you\n\n180\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.840\nare purchasing a motherboard, is how many\nof these slots are on the motherboard?\n\n181\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.600\nNow, I also want you to keep in mind,\ntoo, is that,\n\n182\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.590\nwhen you are going to install these, don't\njust assume that because you've got PCIE\n\n183\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.170\nthat you're gonna get\nthe best performance, right?\n\n184\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.630\nThere are different versions of PCIe,\ntoo, so\n\n185\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.870\nyou also have to spend a little bit of\ntime doing a little bit of research.\n\n186\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.960\nAnd if your motherboard\nsupports the newer PCI 3.0 and\n\n187\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.850\nthis is 2017, so\nit should be released sometime this year.\n\n188\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.900\nPCIe special interest group, or PCI SIG,\n\n189\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.070\nis gonna release the formal standards for\nPCI 4.0.\n\n190\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.470\nRemember that, yes, PCI-E 4.0 or\n3.0 it will work in a PCI-E 1.0 slot, but\n\n191\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:10.340\nthe problem is you only going to\nget that single line throughput up\n\n192\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.390\nto 250 megs versus the one gig that you\nwould get inside of the newer standard.\n\n193\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.190\nSo these PCIE cards, yeah they're\nbackwards compatible with the older\n\n194\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.640\nstandard, but like we've talked\nabout in our memory episodes,\n\n195\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.320\nif you put a faster card\nin an older standard its\n\n196\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.775\nessentially gonna throttle it down or\nbottleneck it down to the slower speed.\n\n197\n00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:31.406\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n198\n00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:36.920\nthat is something to keep in mind when\nit comes to your expansion cards.\n\n199\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.780\nNow later on in this episode, we'll talk\nabout some additional considerations that\n\n200\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.520\nI definitely wanna come back to.\n\n201\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.870\nBut on the exam they do call out a few\ndifferent types of PCI cards, or\n\n202\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.330\nnot PCI cards, excuse me.\n\n203\n00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.370\nPC expansion cards, a lot of acronyms\nfloating around in this brain here.\n\n204\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.830\n&gt;&gt; What about sound cards?\n\n205\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.520\n&gt;&gt; Sound cards,\n\n206\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.400\nokay now that's an interesting concept\ntoo because like I was telling you,\n\n207\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.290\nvideo could be integrated into\nthe chipset of the motherboard, right?\n\n208\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.670\nWe talked about northbridge,\nsouthbridge in our motherboard episode.\n\n209\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.660\nFor those of you that are Intel buffs,\nI really like Intel's name of it,\n\n210\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.460\nMemory Controller Hub, MCH, ICH, right?\n\n211\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:16.260\nWhat that means is that group of chips\nunderstands how to compute video, right?\n\n212\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.710\nWell, it also can understand\nhow to compute your sound.\n\n213\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.640\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n214\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.240\nGoing again, I am going back here.\n\n215\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.005\nI don't wanna get you\nguys motion sick here.\n\n216\n00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:26.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is the fact that integrated into this\n\n217\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.870\nmotherboard, into the chip set,\nit knows audio.\n\n218\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.400\nIt knows how to perform audio.\n\n219\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.830\nI don't need to put any audio\ncard in this machine at all.\n\n220\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.320\nHowever, what if I want that seven\nto one Dolby surround sound?\n\n221\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.500\nWell, I really don't have that.\n\n222\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we need that, Wes.\n\n223\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.120\nWe need it.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n224\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.490\nSo what I have to do is I have to upgrade.\n\n225\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.370\n&gt;&gt; I have to expand the functionality\nof the mother board by taking a card in\n\n226\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.420\nthis case, dedicated to audio and\nputting it in one of the expansion slots.\n\n227\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.830\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nthis is one of the older Audigy.\n\n228\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.060\nI'm pretty sure this is\na Creative Sound Blaster Audigy Card.\n\n229\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.933\nThis one is probably, yeah it's a PCI\ncard so fairly old by today's standards,\n\n230\n00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:13.088\nbut again, you can see that is has\nthe dedicated circuitry, right,\n\n231\n00:12:13.088 --> 00:12:14.751\nto give you a better sound.\n\n232\n00:12:14.751 --> 00:12:18.609\nNotice that you have more, this is,\nI don't know if that's 5.1 or 4.1 so\n\n233\n00:12:18.609 --> 00:12:21.380\nagain it's relatively old\nby today's standards.\n\n234\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.040\nBecause even modern motherboards have\n7.1 surround built right into them.\n\n235\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.960\nBut now you get the dedicated\nfunctionality because remember when\n\n236\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.620\nthe motherboard has to do that,\n\n237\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.020\nthe motherboard is doing all\nother kinds of things, right.\n\n238\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.170\nIt's communicating across the motherboard\nthat's controlling input and\n\n239\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.280\noutput devices.\n\n240\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.820\nYou've got memory comptroller\nhubs sending information in and\n\n241\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.070\nout of the memory in the cpu.\n\n242\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.410\nSo that motherboard is\nalready doing a lot.\n\n243\n00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.900\nIf you take a card like this, a sound\ncard in here, and go into your BIOS and\n\n244\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.240\nturn the sound, you might have to\nturn the integrated audio off.\n\n245\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.510\nNow you've got a device that\nits sole purpose in life,\n\n246\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:02.580\nits sole design, its hardware\nacceleration is made focus just on audio.\n\n247\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.220\nAnd you typically get\na better performance.\n\n248\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.300\nSo that's one good thing\nabout the sound cards, and\n\n249\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.670\nthere are all different\nkinds of cards out there.\n\n250\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.890\nLike I said, this is commonly\nintegrated into the motherboard.\n\n251\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.760\nAnd that brings us back\nto our original point,\n\n252\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.130\nis the fact that the manufacturers can\nkeep the price point relatively low.\n\n253\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.360\nBecause they give you all that\nfunctionality to begin with, right?\n\n254\n00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.120\nHowever, it can also ramp up the cost\nof a machine like Dell, if you will, or\n\n255\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.000\nHP if they're selling you a machine\nthat has a dedicated card\n\n256\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.220\ninstalled in one of those slots.\n\n257\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.070\nSo sound cards are definitely\nsomething that you can see.\n\n258\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.310\nNow I've kind of already\nmentioned video cards.\n\n259\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.090\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust retouch basically on that one,\n\n260\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.520\nvideo cards as well, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.180\nAgain, a dedicated processor, right?\n\n262\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.630\nThey call them GPU's and they also have\ntheir own dedicated memory, right?\n\n263\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:59.470\nMemory we talked about DDR, DDR2, DDR3,\nwell you have what's known as GDDR, right?\n\n264\n00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.140\nAnd I think they're up to five or\nsix by now.\n\n265\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.230\nGDDR5 right?\n\n266\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.630\nAnd this is graphics double data rate.\n\n267\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:11.010\nBasically memory,\nit's memory that is on that expansion card\n\n268\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.340\nthat is dedicated to nothing but\ngraphics rendering.\n\n269\n00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.050\nAnd what you can do is\nalleviate your chip set and\n\n270\n00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:23.270\nany integrated functionality in the CPU so\nthe CPU can perform it's calculations.\n\n271\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.170\nSee, CPUs and\n\n272\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.390\nGPUs, graphics processing unit,\nthey calculate data different, right?\n\n273\n00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.090\nCPU's calcuwait, calculate?\n\n274\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Calcuwait, I like it.\n\n275\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.224\n&gt;&gt; Well we'll make our own contributions\nhere to these [CROSSTALK].\n\n276\n00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:37.330\n&gt;&gt; Cawcuwait it really, really good.\n\n277\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.582\n&gt;&gt; That's right, CPUs, what they do is\nthey calculate data on sequential streams,\n\n278\n00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:45.774\nthreads of information, right, graphics\ncards, graphics processing can take\n\n279\n00:14:45.774 --> 00:14:48.650\na single bit of data and\nit can do five different things.\n\n280\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.020\nIt can do parallel computing to it.\n\n281\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.480\nSo what you have when you have\na GPU is something that is\n\n282\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.670\ndedicated to just that functionality.\n\n283\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.650\nNow there is another\nthing to keep in mind.\n\n284\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.740\nThere are all different kind\nof manufacturers out there.\n\n285\n00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.760\nNvidia and ATI are some of the ones\nthat come to mind right away.\n\n286\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.670\nNvidia, they make some very, very strong,\nsome of the strongest cards out there.\n\n287\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.490\nATI is out there.\n\n288\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.970\nASUS to give you an example, but\n\n289\n00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.620\nthere are times, and here's where\nthe motherboard, if you're making\n\n290\n00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.200\na decision on what motherboard to get,\nthat you have to keep in mind.\n\n291\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.930\nIf we could go back to this motherboard,\nthere are some configurations that allow\n\n292\n00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.820\nyou and I'm not really sure that they're\ngonna ask you too much of this on\n\n293\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.470\nthe exam, but it is good for\nyour own knowledge.\n\n294\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.720\nNotice I have one PCI card, a PCIE card.\n\n295\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.844\nWell, you can actually, there are\nconfigurations out there that allows you\n\n296\n00:15:36.844 --> 00:15:40.663\nto stack multiples of this PCIE cards\ntogether and they work in tandem.\n\n297\n00:15:40.663 --> 00:15:45.143\nRight, and when they work in tandem, think\nabout grouping all the functionality of\n\n298\n00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:49.624\nfour cards together and all four cards are\nsimultaneously processing your graphics\n\n299\n00:15:49.624 --> 00:15:53.095\ninformation giving you the Ferrari or\nFerrari's, if you will,\n\n300\n00:15:53.095 --> 00:15:57.541\nwhen it comes to computational power of\nthe rendering of the graphics, all right.\n\n301\n00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.531\nNow, there are some considerations,\n\n302\n00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:03.220\nfirst you have to find out does it\nsupport things like CrossFire and SLI.\n\n303\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.060\nTwo different technologies,\nSingle Link Interface and CrossFire,\n\n304\n00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.940\none's Nvidia,\none's ATI to allow these to run tandem.\n\n305\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.390\nAnd you essentially have bridged cable\nthat connects them all together.\n\n306\n00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.970\nSo again, kind of like we talk about\nmulti-processors having more than one core\n\n307\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.080\nthat all work together to give you\na better computing experience.\n\n308\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.672\nWell that's the same thing\nthat these cards will do, but\n\n309\n00:16:22.672 --> 00:16:27.740\nyou have to pay attention to not only the\nmotherboard as well, but card placement.\n\n310\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.190\nBecause sometimes it supports it,\na lot of them do today but\n\n311\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.750\nnot necessarily going out the gate\nwill everyone support that.\n\n312\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.550\nSo that's a little bit\nabout your video cards.\n\n313\n00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Network cards, maybe?\n\n314\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.380\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n315\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.840\nWell, you know,\nthat's an interesting concept too.\n\n316\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.140\nBecause most [LAUGH] of your motherboards\ntoday have network cards built right in.\n\n317\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.060\nBut what if you want to do\nsomething like what we call bonding\n\n318\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.730\ntwo network ports together, right?\n\n319\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:01.300\nI want to say that I've got a port that\nwill take one gigabit of data across it.\n\n320\n00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.750\nHow much information will\nflow through that port?\n\n321\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.400\nBut I want to take two of those and\nI want to bond them together, so\n\n322\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.370\nnow I get two gigabyte speeds, right?\n\n323\n00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.520\nOr you want just better fast throughput,\nwell,\n\n324\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.810\nthat's where you get things\nlike network adapters.\n\n325\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.010\nAnd network adapters, guys,\n\n326\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.060\nthey don't really look much\ndifferent than any other card.\n\n327\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.810\nAnd you'll start to figure out, once\nyou understand the bus architecture and\n\n328\n00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.670\nthe specifications behind it,\na card is card, right?\n\n329\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.230\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nin fact, this is a network adapter.\n\n330\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.159\nThis is an Ethernet card here, and\nyou can see that, let's say, for one that.\n\n331\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.840\nRare day to day that motherboards\n\n332\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.300\ndon't have network adapters built\nright into the functionality.\n\n333\n00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.910\nThis motherboard,\nas you've seen as I've tipped it up,\n\n334\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.440\ndoes have this little RJ-45 jack\nEthernet connection in the back of it.\n\n335\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.590\nAnd that's essentially what happens,\n\n336\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:56.570\nwe've got a card that is dedicated to that\nnetwork communication and functionality.\n\n337\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:02.880\nNow, bandwidths can differ, most often\ntoday, you'll see that the specification\n\n338\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.650\nof these network adapters are 10 megabit,\n100 megabit, and 1,000 megabit.\n\n339\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.460\nWhich basically means they're\nall gigabit speeds today,\n\n340\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.140\nso definitely pay attention to that.\n\n341\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.240\nYou might run into some legacy cards, but\n\n342\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.680\nagain when we talk about 100 megabit and\n10 megabit these are old standards.\n\n343\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.910\nAnd most of them will\nperform all in the same slot,\n\n344\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.170\nregardless of what the speed is.\n\n345\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.010\nBut remember, if it's a motherboard that\nhappens, and I think that's gonna be\n\n346\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.830\na rarity in this day,\nhappens to support only the lower speeds.\n\n347\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.860\nIt's always gonna just\ndefault to that lowest speed.\n\n348\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.080\nNow one of the things that we\nalso might need and again,\n\n349\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.530\nthis is another thing that's kinda\nbecoming a thing of the past,\n\n350\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.790\nis that we might need\nadditional USB ports.\n\n351\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.700\nMost of your motherboards today\nby themselves have a ton.\n\n352\n00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.120\nSome of them,\nI think mine at the house has eight.\n\n353\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.740\nEight USB ports on the motherboard\nitself and then I have another four,\n\n354\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.130\nI think, on the case itself.\n\n355\n00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.230\nSo now we're up to 12, so you've got\na lot of USB ports, but never say never.\n\n356\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.790\nNever say never in anything in computing\nbecause maybe you do happen to need\n\n357\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.180\nadditional USB ports.\n\n358\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.370\nWell USB cards, they also have them,\nand they can do the same thing.\n\n359\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.470\nAnd again it's all about\nexpanding the functionality of\n\n360\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.150\nthe system unit collectively as a whole.\n\n361\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.190\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n362\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.950\nWith, this is a USB card here.\n\n363\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:31.550\nWhat your system might not have, and\nthis might be something that you have.\n\n364\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.070\nMaybe you have USB ports,\nbut you have USB 2.0 ports,\n\n365\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.560\nwell this is a USB 3.0\ncard that sits in a PCIE.\n\n366\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.550\nAnd I believe this is either a one, don't\nquote me on this, this is either a one or\n\n367\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.170\na four lane.\n\n368\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.370\nI wanna say it might be a four lane slot.\n\n369\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.950\nBut this is a PCIE card that, and\n\n370\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:54.370\nI can tell by the blue adapter,\nthat's USB 3.0.\n\n371\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.295\nSo while I do have USB ports here,\nthey're 2.0 and\n\n372\n00:19:57.295 --> 00:19:59.643\nthey're going to run it 480 megabits.\n\n373\n00:19:59.643 --> 00:20:03.964\nBut if I want the new standard,\nyou can put one of these PCIE cards in and\n\n374\n00:20:03.964 --> 00:20:09.103\nyou now have a card that is dedicated to\nthe USB 3.0 factor, or a specification.\n\n375\n00:20:09.103 --> 00:20:13.659\nAnd we go from a functionality of a\ntheoretical of 480 megabits right up to 5\n\n376\n00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:15.200\ngigabits, right?\n\n377\n00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.513\nSo again, you can see that you're\nexpanding your horizons, right?\n\n378\n00:20:18.513 --> 00:20:22.280\nYou're expanding the functionality\nof the overall system collectively.\n\n379\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.030\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't there like a type A,\ntype C, type B USB?\n\n380\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.980\n&gt;&gt; There are, but\n\n381\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.480\nwhen it comes to these cards we don't\nreally have to worry about the type.\n\n382\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.890\nBecause what they're gonna do, what\nthey're gonna plug into the system here,\n\n383\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:40.530\nis typically the type A connector.\n\n384\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.380\nLet me make sure I get that right,\nyeah, the type A connector.\n\n385\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.300\nThat being said,\nwe do have the USB-C adapter,\n\n386\n00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.880\nI don't think it's gonna be called\nout on this exam objectives.\n\n387\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.690\nCuz that's a relatively\nnew connector this year or\n\n388\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.940\nthe end of last year, we are in 2017 here,\nbut I wouldn't really worry about that.\n\n389\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.740\nEssentially it's bringing your USB\nports and the USB functionality,\n\n390\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.210\nor increasing the amount of ports\nthat you have on the system.\n\n391\n00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.400\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, very cool.\n\n392\n00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Now.\n\n393\n00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.160\n&gt;&gt; Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt?\n\n394\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Thunderbolt and lightning, very,\n\n395\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.752\nvery, frightening.\n\n396\n00:21:09.752 --> 00:21:13.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] hey,\nThunderbolt is a newer technology.\n\n397\n00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.895\nAnd when I say newer technology,\n\n398\n00:21:14.895 --> 00:21:19.430\nanytime I say newer technology, I mean\nit's relative to the overall PC industry.\n\n399\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.980\nWe're actually in U.S.\nThunderbolt 3, I believe, right now.\n\n400\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.220\nSo its kind of started to mature,\n\n401\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.030\nbut you're bringing Thunderbolt\nconnectivity right to your machine.\n\n402\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.110\nIf you have something like\nPCIE 3.0 that it supports, and\n\n403\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.170\nI don't have that Thunderbolt connector.\n\n404\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.690\nThat needs to connect to different,\nlets say display devices,\n\n405\n00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.100\nor external peripherals.\n\n406\n00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.600\nWell then, I'm going to need a card,\nI'm going to need a Thunderbolt card.\n\n407\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.232\nAnd just like I said, you're going\nto make sure that it's PCIE, and\n\n408\n00:21:47.232 --> 00:21:50.710\nI believe that it's PCIE 3.0 that gives\nyou access to the Thunderbolt standard.\n\n409\n00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.570\nDon't quote me on that, but you won't have\nto worry about that too much on the exam.\n\n410\n00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:54.863\nBut essentially,\n\n411\n00:21:54.863 --> 00:22:00.529\nbringing that Thunderbolt communication\nto a PC that otherwise might not have it.\n\n412\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.710\nNow, here's another thing that we\nalso have to keep in mind too.\n\n413\n00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.370\nNot only Thunderbolt cards, but\nwe have what are known as storage cards.\n\n414\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.270\nAnd when we talk about a storage card,\ntypically on your motherboards today.\n\n415\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.850\nMost of your higher end\nmotherboards will have\n\n416\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.250\nupwards of ten serial ATA ports,\nSATA ports, as they are called.\n\n417\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.410\nYou'll remember,\nthese go to your hard drives.\n\n418\n00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.450\nAnd in fact,\nif we look at this motherboard right here,\n\n419\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.080\nI can see, this one has two, right?\n\n420\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.020\nYou can see the two serial ATA ports\nright here, and if I look around,\n\n421\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.630\nI don't see any more.\n\n422\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.990\nSo that's two, so\n\n423\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.810\nthis means that this machine could\nsupport a maximum of two hard drives.\n\n424\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.100\nBut what if I need a little bit more?\n\n425\n00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.510\nWhat if I've got a case that actually\nsupports ten serial ATA hard drives?\n\n426\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.790\nWell it doesn't matter.\n\n427\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.070\nThat means I got a garage that can\nfit that, but I don't have the cars,\n\n428\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.600\nif you will [LAUGH] inside.\n\n429\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.110\n&gt;&gt; To fill it.\n\n430\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what you can do is\nyou can take one of these cards,\n\n431\n00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.710\nyou could put a storage card\nin one of the expansion slots.\n\n432\n00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.990\nAnd that storage card will have multiple\nserial ATA connectors that will again\n\n433\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.310\nallow you to increase the storage\ncapacity in even things like, for\n\n434\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.540\ninstance, RAID cards.\n\n435\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.230\nWe'll talk about the Redundant Array of\nIndependent Disks in another episode.\n\n436\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.880\nBut now I bring things like\nthe RAID functionality,\n\n437\n00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.300\nwhere we could put multiple of these\nhard drives in tandem together.\n\n438\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.320\nAnd make them run faster, or give them a\nlittle bit of fault tolerance in case one\n\n439\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.880\nfails, we still have\naccess to our information.\n\n440\n00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.870\nBut you could see the limiting\nfactor on this board.\n\n441\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.500\nIf I need four hard drives,\nwell, I don't have it,\n\n442\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.990\nI only have the ability to do two.\n\n443\n00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.910\nSo if I put one of these storage cards\nin one of these expansion slots,\n\n444\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.160\nit could have four, five, six.\n\n445\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.960\nIt could have ten serial ATA cards and\nthen I can\n\n446\n00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.870\nexpand the amount of hard drives that\nI could put inside of the machine.\n\n447\n00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.480\nNow, you have other\ntypes of storage cards.\n\n448\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.882\nAgain, you have Enterprise level\ncards that allow you to bring things\n\n449\n00:23:51.882 --> 00:23:55.029\nlike serial attached SCSI\nto the functionality.\n\n450\n00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:59.919\nEven higher-end cards,\nthey call them host bus adapters, HBA's.\n\n451\n00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:02.078\nAnd that's for things like Fibre Channel,\n\n452\n00:24:02.078 --> 00:24:05.414\nif you're gonna be running to\nfiber-optic storage, if you will.\n\n453\n00:24:05.414 --> 00:24:07.865\nAnd if you're not familiar\nwith Fibre Channel,\n\n454\n00:24:07.865 --> 00:24:10.750\nwe'll talk a little bit more\nabout it in later episodes.\n\n455\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.653\nAnd definitely as you go on\ninto things like Network+,\n\n456\n00:24:12.653 --> 00:24:14.929\nyou'll have to understand a little\nbit more about Fibre Channel.\n\n457\n00:24:14.929 --> 00:24:17.425\nBut high speed, I mean, high speed,\n\n458\n00:24:17.425 --> 00:24:22.160\nlong distances essentially\nfiber-optic communications, right?\n\n459\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.085\nAnd in an enterprise environment,\n\n460\n00:24:24.085 --> 00:24:28.589\nyou might have a workstation that's doing\nhigh-end 3D rendering or something.\n\n461\n00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:32.321\nIt's a large quantities of information\nthat you need to push very fast over\n\n462\n00:24:32.321 --> 00:24:34.460\na fiber-optic communication.\n\n463\n00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.431\nYou can do that as well, you can\nbring that kind of communication or\n\n464\n00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:40.320\nthat kind of functionality\nto the overall machine.\n\n465\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Modem cards?\n\n466\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.934\n&gt;&gt; Modems, you might think that's\nfunny too, we think of modems,\n\n467\n00:24:43.934 --> 00:24:45.441\nI think of dial-up and the dial-up days.\n\n468\n00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:46.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got mail.\n\n469\n00:24:46.931 --> 00:24:50.411\n&gt;&gt; But, keep in mind, I want you to\nunderstand that dial-up isn't dead,\n\n470\n00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:50.990\nall right?\n\n471\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.250\nYou might think, really, dial-up?\n\n472\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.350\nWell, you gotta understand\nthat dial-up is still used and\n\n473\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.950\nit's still used prevalent today.\n\n474\n00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.320\nBecause in areas, especially\nthings like emerging countries and\n\n475\n00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.330\nthird-world countries.\n\n476\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.690\nAnd even countries where it's not\nfeasible to run things like fiber optics,\n\n477\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.910\nwe still have those old PSTN lines,\nthe public switched telephone networks,\n\n478\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.780\nyour old telephone lines, right?\n\n479\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.550\nAnd the other thing too is,\nin disaster situations,\n\n480\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.000\nwhen the networks get wiped out,\na lot of times you still have access to\n\n481\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.710\ntraditional phone lines, so\nmodem cards, you have them, right?\n\n482\n00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.230\nSo don't discount them as being gone.\n\n483\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.420\nHowever, they are considered\nmore in the home market,\n\n484\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.610\nmore of a legacy-based technology.\n\n485\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.446\nBut that is where you can essentially hook\nyour modem up to with the old telephone\n\n486\n00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:33.493\ncable or RJ11 jack, and\nplug it into the back of the machine.\n\n487\n00:25:33.493 --> 00:25:36.660\n&gt;&gt; And that kinda leads up\nto wireless cellular cards.\n\n488\n00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, and\nthose are two different concepts.\n\n489\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.710\nI mean, what they're talking about is\nunbounded communications when it comes\n\n490\n00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.970\ndown to it, right?\n\n491\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.820\nWireless adapter is something\nthat's unique because, in fact,\n\n492\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.330\nI got an example of a wireless\nadapter right here.\n\n493\n00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.020\nIt does exactly that, right?\n\n494\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.388\nMaybe I don't have the capabilities\nof running wired connections.\n\n495\n00:25:57.388 --> 00:26:00.991\nYou say, wait a second, Wes,\neverybody has got wired connection.\n\n496\n00:26:00.991 --> 00:26:03.393\nNot necessarily,\nlet me give you an example.\n\n497\n00:26:03.393 --> 00:26:10.690\nMaybe you work in a building that\nis under a historical site, right?\n\n498\n00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.200\nAnd historical sites that\nare overseen by your local state,\n\n499\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.700\nmaybe even the federal level, you don't go\nin there and you just bust down a wall and\n\n500\n00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.020\nstart running wires, right?\n\n501\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.720\nSo in that case,\nyou might have to connect wirelessly.\n\n502\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.500\nMaybe that's what you have,\nmaybe that's the only capability, right?\n\n503\n00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.460\nI live in apartment, there's no way\nI'm gonna justify to the apartment\n\n504\n00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.570\ncomplex that I just buried a wire in\na wall that I just took out, right?\n\n505\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.340\nSo when you have limited, right,\nyou have limitations, right,\n\n506\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.020\nstructural limitations, wireless adapters\nare something that is going to be great.\n\n507\n00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.739\nHere's another thing, too.\n\n508\n00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.190\nRight now currently we're under\nthe 802.11 AC standard as common.\n\n509\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.824\nI just threw a whole bunch out of these,\nyou guys look at our wireless section and\n\n510\n00:26:50.824 --> 00:26:52.806\nour networking, and\nyou'll understand what that means.\n\n511\n00:26:52.806 --> 00:26:55.199\nBut that's fast speeds, right?\n\n512\n00:26:55.199 --> 00:26:59.575\nBut I don't have that\ncapability in my machine.\n\n513\n00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:02.660\nOr I can bring that functionality\ninto my machine by installing\n\n514\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.360\none of these wireless adapter cards,\nright?\n\n515\n00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.069\nNow, Zach,\nyou also mentioned another thing and\n\n516\n00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:08.460\nthat was the cellular card, all right?\n\n517\n00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.510\nCellular cards are typically something\nthat is can be bought by itself, but\n\n518\n00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.873\nis a lot of times bought from a carrier,\nright, an Internet service provider, or\n\n519\n00:27:16.873 --> 00:27:19.680\ncellular telephone carrier like Verizon,\nright?\n\n520\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.690\nThey're both, they're actually\nan Internet backbone provider,\n\n521\n00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.360\nthey're cellular provider as well.\n\n522\n00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.530\nNow what I do is I can sometimes you\ncan install these right in expansion\n\n523\n00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.020\ncard slots, right?\n\n524\n00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.738\nMore common today, and a lot more\nconvenient is just a USB port that you\n\n525\n00:27:32.738 --> 00:27:34.826\nplug the cellular card in and\nit goes to town, right?\n\n526\n00:27:34.826 --> 00:27:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Like a thumb?\n\n527\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.010\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah,\nlittle thumb drives, right?\n\n528\n00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.856\nBut it's not something that you won't see,\nand\n\n529\n00:27:40.856 --> 00:27:43.570\nthe fact that you can actually do\nthe same thing with an expansion card.\n\n530\n00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.980\nAnd what does that give you?\n\n531\n00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.721\nMobile broadband, essentially,\nit's what it does, right?\n\n532\n00:27:47.721 --> 00:27:51.389\nNow we're not limited, we're not\ntethered to a local area network, and\n\n533\n00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:52.820\nnow we're mobile, right?\n\n534\n00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.520\nWe can move the device whatever\nthe computing device is,\n\n535\n00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.630\nthe system unit, where we need to provide,\nwe have power, plug into the motel, right?\n\n536\n00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.400\nDon't have to worry about the wireless\naccess point in the motel being absolutely\n\n537\n00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.560\nhorribly slow because we now have\naccess to a cellular data card.\n\n538\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.753\nAnd again, these are very proprietary,\nthey are proprietary, and\n\n539\n00:28:13.753 --> 00:28:18.023\na lot of times they are controlled and\nmaintained by your cellular providers.\n\n540\n00:28:18.023 --> 00:28:20.468\n&gt;&gt; Do we have time to go\nthrough some more of these?\n\n541\n00:28:20.468 --> 00:28:21.958\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you got yourself-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [CROSSTALK] TV tuner cards?\n\n542\n00:28:21.958 --> 00:28:25.278\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we've got just\na few more, and we'll go ahead, and\n\n543\n00:28:25.278 --> 00:28:26.115\nwrap it up here.\n\n544\n00:28:26.115 --> 00:28:30.283\nTV tuner card is a very\ninteresting type of card.\n\n545\n00:28:30.283 --> 00:28:35.580\nAnd they call out a couple of these,\nand they get confusing sometimes.\n\n546\n00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.100\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\ntackle two concepts here at once, right?\n\n547\n00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.130\nA TV tuner card and\na video capture card, all right?\n\n548\n00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.550\nWell, a TV tuner card, I can show you\nan example of one that we have here.\n\n549\n00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.560\nA TV tuner card does exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n550\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.420\nIt allows you to tune into TV channels,\n\n551\n00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.820\nessentially bring the TV channels,\nif you will, stream them into your TV.\n\n552\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.554\nNow you also have a video capture card.\n\n553\n00:29:00.554 --> 00:29:04.582\nAnd the video capture card this\nallows you to record video.\n\n554\n00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:08.090\nNow you might ask yourself and\nI've been asked this as well.\n\n555\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.880\nWhat's the difference\nbetween a TV tuner card?\n\n556\n00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.440\nIf I'm looking at video on my machine\nthat's coming into my computer and\n\n557\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.050\na TV capture card?\n\n558\n00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.490\nWell, I don't have to have a TV\ntuner to do video capture, right?\n\n559\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.272\nIf I'm somebody that wants to capture\nvideo within the system itself,\n\n560\n00:29:21.272 --> 00:29:22.480\nthat's what it does.\n\n561\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.051\nIt allows me to capture the video, but\n\n562\n00:29:24.051 --> 00:29:26.319\nit doesn't allow me to tune\nin to TV channels, right?\n\n563\n00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:28.317\nAnd that's what we can\ndo with these cards.\n\n564\n00:29:28.317 --> 00:29:33.104\nTV tuner allows me the ability to\nstream the television communication\n\n565\n00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.652\nthrough my computer.\n\n566\n00:29:34.652 --> 00:29:38.379\nAnd a lot of times what you'll have\nis a capture functionality built into\n\n567\n00:29:38.379 --> 00:29:41.937\nthese cards to where we can basically\nturn your TV into a DVR, right?\n\n568\n00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:44.677\nYou can either be a media server,\nexcuse me,\n\n569\n00:29:44.677 --> 00:29:48.733\neither a media server where you're\njust tuning in the TV, right?\n\n570\n00:29:48.733 --> 00:29:53.380\nOr you can also record it and\nwatch it at a later time, right?\n\n571\n00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.990\nThese were big with things\nlike Windows Media Center,\n\n572\n00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.290\nthere's many other media centers out\nthere that you can go and check out.\n\n573\n00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.910\nBut definitely pay attention to whatever\nthe functionality of your computer is.\n\n574\n00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.060\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n575\n00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Now the last one I wanna\ntalk about as far as cards go.\n\n576\n00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.170\nThis is kind of a funny one here.\n\n577\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.890\nAnd I can probably just hold\nthis one up a little bit easier.\n\n578\n00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.410\nAnd this is what's known as a riser card.\n\n579\n00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:20.630\nRiser cards are typically used inside\na very small form factor systems.\n\n580\n00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.917\nAnd ladies and gents, I'm talking\nabout cases like this wide, right?\n\n581\n00:30:23.917 --> 00:30:28.160\nAnd maybe I don't have the ability,\nlike we've done here on our\n\n582\n00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.200\nmotherboard to install one of these\ncards and still close the case, right?\n\n583\n00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.320\nBecause there is just\nnot enough room in it.\n\n584\n00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.554\nWell, imagine the ability if we\ncan have grab my PCI card here.\n\n585\n00:30:38.554 --> 00:30:44.588\nImagine ability to install this card\nin a PCI slot, and then I turn around.\n\n586\n00:30:44.588 --> 00:30:48.118\nAnd if I get that right,\nand I install this, and\n\n587\n00:30:48.118 --> 00:30:51.670\nit runs now parallel to the motherboard.\n\n588\n00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.620\nAnd I could still close the case,\nand I get the functionality,\n\n589\n00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.570\nbut I don't have\nthe stacking height anymore.\n\n590\n00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.450\n&gt;&gt; It's like a Lego.\n\n591\n00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.440\n&gt;&gt; It is, and the other thing you can\nthink of it is as well is the rat tail,\n\n592\n00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.038\nright?\n\n593\n00:31:03.038 --> 00:31:07.560\nWhen you plug into an AC outlet,\nwhat are you doing, right?\n\n594\n00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.910\nAnd you've got one of\nthose power adapters.\n\n595\n00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.852\nEssentially, what you're doing is you're\ngiving yourself the ability to plug\n\n596\n00:31:13.852 --> 00:31:14.870\nmore devices in.\n\n597\n00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.240\nMaybe your computer,\n\n598\n00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.700\nthe small form factor computer you have,\nonly has a single expansion slot.\n\n599\n00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.800\nWell, I can populate that expansion slot,\nand now I've split it up into two and\n\n600\n00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.070\nI can put more functionality.\n\n601\n00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.079\nSo, this is an older one, this is a PCI\nriser card, and PCIs kind of gone,\n\n602\n00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:30.740\nby the way.\n\n603\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.490\nI mean, we still see it today, and\nit's not that you won't see it out there.\n\n604\n00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.741\nBut you also have PCIe\nriser cards as well, and\n\n605\n00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:39.070\nyou can find those too\nin things like servers.\n\n606\n00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.630\nCuz servers are very, very thin,\nthey're very long, but they're very thin.\n\n607\n00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.370\nAnd you might need to run those cards,\nagain, parallel to the motherboard.\n\n608\n00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.495\nNow there's one last thing, I know Zach,\nwe are running out of time here.\n\n609\n00:31:49.495 --> 00:31:54.598\nA couple of considerations that I want\nyou to consider, to keep in mind.\n\n610\n00:31:54.598 --> 00:31:56.699\nDrivers, all right.\n\n611\n00:31:56.699 --> 00:32:01.307\nDrivers are that component that allows\nyour operating system to talk to your\n\n612\n00:32:01.307 --> 00:32:02.760\nhardware, all right.\n\n613\n00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.180\nIt's kind of like the translator.\n\n614\n00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.275\nOperating systems are programmed in\na high level programming language or\n\n615\n00:32:08.275 --> 00:32:12.763\ncoded, if you will, and our hardware runs\non a very low level like machine code,\n\n616\n00:32:12.763 --> 00:32:14.891\nthey don't speak the same language.\n\n617\n00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:18.494\nSo we download and update drivers and\nthey're the translator,\n\n618\n00:32:18.494 --> 00:32:22.833\nthey're the middleman between the high\nlevel programming language and that\n\n619\n00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:27.524\nmachine code that allow our, basically\nour hardware, to talk with our software.\n\n620\n00:32:27.524 --> 00:32:32.864\nDrive adapters most often today\nare plug-and-play compatible.\n\n621\n00:32:32.864 --> 00:32:37.580\nAnd plug-and-play means the device can\nbe plugged in, the motherboard and\n\n622\n00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:42.060\nthe BIOS will communicate with\nthe resources, memory locations,\n\n623\n00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:48.810\nthe CPU if you will, and figure this out,\nand basically you're ready to go.\n\n624\n00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:51.140\nThat doesn't mean that\nyou won't need a driver.\n\n625\n00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.750\nYou typically need drivers\nespecially with video cards.\n\n626\n00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.990\nThe other thing too is you sometimes and\n\n627\n00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.560\na lot of times need to update\ndrivers to your video cards as well.\n\n628\n00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.320\nBecause when you do an update to a driver,\n\n629\n00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.700\na lot of times it fixes known flaws or\nbugs in the software or\n\n630\n00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.400\nin the programming, and\nsometimes expands the functionality.\n\n631\n00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.030\nSo yes, rely on plug-and-plays,\nit's a great thing.\n\n632\n00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.160\nYou plug in the device.\n\n633\n00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.400\nIt allocates all the resources it needs.\n\n634\n00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.552\nThe operating system's communicating.\n\n635\n00:33:16.552 --> 00:33:20.468\nA lot of times your operating systems\nlike Windows have built in drivers and\n\n636\n00:33:20.468 --> 00:33:22.592\nit says, I know exactly what that is.\n\n637\n00:33:22.592 --> 00:33:25.950\nBut that doesn't mean you're gonna get\nthe full functionality of the device.\n\n638\n00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.090\nAlways check with\nthe manufacturer when you install\n\n639\n00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.890\nsome kind of expansion card into the\nmotherboard itself, because if you do not,\n\n640\n00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:36.790\nyou do run the chance of either\nnot communicating with it,\n\n641\n00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:41.830\nreduced functionality, or\njust instability and problems if you will.\n\n642\n00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:46.670\nBus architecture, PCI doesn't\nwork with PCIe, and vice versa.\n\n643\n00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.120\nMotherboard considerations, pay attention\nto the amount of expansion slots you have.\n\n644\n00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.230\nThe other thing to keep in mind is when\nyou put things like video cards in and\n\n645\n00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.880\nespecially when you start running them\nside by side like I was telling you in\n\n646\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.190\ntandem like that, and SLI and\nCrossfire solution, Heat.\n\n647\n00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.079\nYou might have to increase the cooling\nsystem because you're gonna generate a lot\n\n648\n00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:08.514\nmore heat and the normal system cooling\nthat came with it was adequate for\n\n649\n00:34:08.514 --> 00:34:10.033\nwhat it was when you bought it but\n\n650\n00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:13.891\nmight not be adequate anymore because of\nthe fact that you've now increased it.\n\n651\n00:34:13.891 --> 00:34:18.672\nThe other thing is power considerations,\nespecially when you're talking about PCIe.\n\n652\n00:34:18.672 --> 00:34:24.613\nPCIe is a power hungry boss by itself,\nwithout even populating the cards,\n\n653\n00:34:24.613 --> 00:34:29.611\nthey had to invent a 24-pin\nconnector to give 4 extra pins to\n\n654\n00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:33.430\npower the PCIe bus architecture alone.\n\n655\n00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:37.220\nYour cards themselves might have\nconnectors that are on the back of them,\n\n656\n00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.790\nso you also have to pay attention\nto your power requirements,\n\n657\n00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:45.270\nthe available wattage you have in\nthe system as well as the connectors.\n\n658\n00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:49.120\nLast, but not least, pay attention\nto the case you have itself, right.\n\n659\n00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.320\nBecause the case itself,\nyour motherboard, ATX motherboard,\n\n660\n00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.410\nremember we said form factor, case, power\nsupply and motherboard all have to match.\n\n661\n00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.245\nBut just because you have an ATX board and\nan ATX case,\n\n662\n00:35:00.245 --> 00:35:04.088\nif that case only has two available slots,\nblanking plates on the back,\n\n663\n00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:08.003\nyou can't populate let's say if you\nhave four slots on the motherboard.\n\n664\n00:35:08.003 --> 00:35:08.871\nYou can't populate them.\n\n665\n00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:12.613\nYou gotta make sure that the case from\nthe back of the case that you have enough\n\n666\n00:35:12.613 --> 00:35:16.065\navailable openings on the back of\nthe case to utilize every one of those\n\n667\n00:35:16.065 --> 00:35:18.030\nslots on the motherboard.\n\n668\n00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.603\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, as usual, thank you Wes.\n\n669\n00:35:20.603 --> 00:35:23.884\nPC

That's right.\n\n10\n00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:34.298\nWe're gonna be looking at, well, some of\nthe different technologies that you have\n\n11\n00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:37.571\nto be familiar with if you are going\nto make a decision on what to install.\n\n12\n00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.254\nWhen it comes to different\nstorage mediums that we have.\n\n13\n00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:42.710\nAnd we've got a whole\nbunch of different types.\n\n14\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.330\nBut when it comes to storage medium,\n\n15\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.280\nit really boils down to a couple basic\nconcepts that we want you to be aware of.\n\n16\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.079\nSo storage mediums, if you will,\nthe media if you will or\n\n17\n00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.863\nthe components within your system unit.\n\n18\n00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:58.820\nThat allow us to take our data,\nstored on it, like the name implies.\n\n19\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.279\nBut more importantly, for\nreusal at a later time.\n\n20\n00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:07.327\nIn past episodes we have talked about\nour volatile memory, our system memory.\n\n21\n00:01:07.327 --> 00:01:10.438\nAnd the fact that that's\na a temporary works bench.\n\n22\n00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.780\nThe bigger that work bench,\nif you will, the more memory you have.\n\n23\n00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.980\nWell, the more information you\ncould be working with at one time.\n\n24\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.760\nBut the problem here is, remember when we\nsaid when you cut that electrical current,\n\n25\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.700\nthe power shuts off or\npower the computer down.\n\n26\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.881\nAnything that is stored within that\nmemory region is going to be lost.\n\n27\n00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:33.000\nSo if we wanna store our data, and\n\n28\n00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.173\nwe want to pull that data back into\nthe system unit at a later time.\n\n29\n00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:41.680\nWe have a few different types of storage\ndevices that we need to look at.\n\n30\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.077\nNow, they really boil down to\ntwo different types today,\n\n31\n00:01:44.077 --> 00:01:46.126\nwell actually three different types.\n\n32\n00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.929\nThey boil down to what is\nknown as magnetic media.\n\n33\n00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.866\nMagnetic media has been around for\na very long time.\n\n34\n00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:55.550\nAnd it really is one of\nthe oldest storage medium types.\n\n35\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.500\nThe second one is optical,\noptical storage.\n\n36\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.850\nAnd this is something as well that\nhas also been around for awhile.\n\n37\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.030\nThe third one is, I don't wanna say\nnew by computing standards today.\n\n38\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.230\nI guess if you look at a larger picture\nof things, newer than the other two.\n\n39\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.250\nAnd that's called electronic storage.\n\n40\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.260\nNow, the other thing that we also have\nto keep in mind is that sometimes\n\n41\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.670\ndevices are mechanical as well.\n\n42\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.690\nVersus the electronic storage which\nis a non-mechanical type of device,\n\n43\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.234\nstorage medium if you will.\n\n44\n00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:30.580\nIn which it just basically means\nyou don't have moving parts.\n\n45\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460\nWe talked about mechanical drives.\n\n46\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.970\nWhat we're talking about is you got\na lot of different pieces inside of them\n\n47\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.380\nthat are moving.\n\n48\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.912\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a couple steps back.\n\n49\n00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:41.220\nAnd let's talk about magnetic media.\n\n50\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.550\nWhen we talk about magnetic media,\nwe talk about basically a magnetic\n\n51\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.900\ncharge is put onto the storage medium\nthat essentially represents our data.\n\n52\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.510\nWe've got different types out there.\n\n53\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.250\nWe've got going back for\na long time if you will, and\n\n54\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.110\npretty much not used in today's industry,\nnot very commonly.\n\n55\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.908\nAnd if it still is, you really need\nto upgrade, are the floppy disks.\n\n56\n00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:04.694\nThe floppy disks were\na magnetic storage type.\n\n57\n00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:06.550\nThey're also mechanical drives,\n\n58\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.890\nbecause they have got a lot of\nlittle moving parts in there.\n\n59\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.810\nAnd it's also what's\nknown as removable media.\n\n60\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.120\nKeep in mind that I should\nprobably mention that.\n\n61\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.880\nWe have what's known as removable media,\nand\n\n62\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.530\nsometimes we have what's\nknown as fixed media.\n\n63\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.690\nNow, to give you an example of\na magnetic media that's fixed, we have\n\n64\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.460\nwhat are known as our internal mechanical\nhard drives, our hard disk drives.\n\n65\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.690\nYou might see the acronym.\n\n66\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.125\nAnd again, just like A+, we're not shy\nof any kind of alphabet soup here.\n\n67\n00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.830\nThe term HDD, and\nthat's a hard disk drive.\n\n68\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.920\nAnd a hard disk drive is one that,\nagain, stores that data magnetically.\n\n69\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.220\nNow the next one we talk about\nagain is the optical drives.\n\n70\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.335\nOptical drives are ones that use\nsome form of an optical laser.\n\n71\n00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:51.881\nAnd what they do is they typically burn\nrecesses, these lowered pits if you will.\n\n72\n00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.727\nOr these raised areas called lands..\n\n73\n00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.274\nAnd they're basically burning the media.\n\n74\n00:03:57.274 --> 00:04:00.100\nThey're melting,\nI think it's Mylar plastic.\n\n75\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.003\nI might have that a little bit wrong but\nit's a plastic removable media.\n\n76\n00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:08.931\nWe can take the optical discs out\nof the mechanical optical drive,\n\n77\n00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:12.100\nand we can use that data at a later date.\n\n78\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.450\n&gt;&gt; Sorta like a laser disc for\nyour computer.\n\n79\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.600\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n80\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.050\nAnd really that's where the laser\ndiscs that we see today,\n\n81\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.480\nthat's really where they started out.\n\n82\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.620\nThey started out in\nthe earlier days more for\n\n83\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.090\nthings like your industrial\nbased computing systems.\n\n84\n00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.900\nNow we also have the electronic storage.\n\n85\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.630\nAnd electronic storage is where we\nget into things like flash drives,\n\n86\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.690\nwe get into things like\nsolid state drives.\n\n87\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.681\nAnd this is where our data is stored\nin non-volatile memory type chips.\n\n88\n00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.338\nRemember and if you're not familiar with\nthat term, we'll recap it a little bit and\n\n89\n00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:44.000\ngo back and watch our memory section.\n\n90\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.930\nBecause we did talked about\nnon-volatile storage.\n\n91\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.030\nAnd remember that is a way that we\ncan send an electrical current.\n\n92\n00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.120\nAnd we can manipulate chips\nthat are within this component.\n\n93\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.000\nThat if we pull the power on\nwhatever the component is or\n\n94\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.460\nthe system unit collectively,\nwe don't lose that data.\n\n95\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.010\nAnd these have their benefits\nbecause of the fact that they're\n\n96\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.370\na non-mechanical drive.\n\n97\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.000\nYou get access times.\n\n98\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.012\nBeing able to grab that information and\nstore that information lightning fast,\n\n99\n00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:11.908\nif you will,\ncompared to the mechanical drives.\n\n100\n00:05:11.908 --> 00:05:14.998\nThe mechanical drives have\na little bit of latency, guys, and\n\n101\n00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:18.690\na little jargon right off the top,\nright at the beginning of this episode.\n\n102\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.790\nWhen we talk about latency,\nwe're talking about delay.\n\n103\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.300\nDelay, latency, the same thing.\n\n104\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.010\nBecause we have to wait\na little bit of time.\n\n105\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.090\nLet me give you an example.\n\n106\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.310\nIf you put a DVD into your DVD player and\nyou turn it on.\n\n107\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.640\nAnd it takes a second for\nthe system to spin up.\n\n108\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.077\nYou typically get, I can move to\ndifferent tracks, are all on that DVD.\n\n109\n00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:41.677\nJust by pushing a button, real quick,\n\n110\n00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:44.890\nwe can get to it versus\nsomething like a record player.\n\n111\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.160\nIf you go with the old record players,\nwhich are obviously still in use today.\n\n112\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.630\nI have to move the needle or\nI have to wait for the needle to come up.\n\n113\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.630\nAnd it's got to seek.\n\n114\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.920\nAnd then it's gotta come down and find\nthe track that's within the record itself.\n\n115\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.257\nSo, that's kind of like what we say when\nwe say mechanical versus electronic.\n\n116\n00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:04.090\nBecause I don't have to\nwait on those moving parts.\n\n117\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.340\nWe get access times that are a lot faster\nthan the traditional mechanical drives.\n\n118\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.843\nSo those are some of the things that\nwe're gonna talk about in this episode.\n\n119\n00:06:10.843 --> 00:06:14.490\nAnd we're going to look little bit\nmore in depth at each one of those.\n\n120\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.673\n&gt;&gt; Question, do you have to install,\nand then configure or\n\n121\n00:06:18.673 --> 00:06:20.686\nconfigure and then install?\n\n122\n00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:21.966\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to the drive types?\n\n123\n00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the great things we have\n\n124\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.220\ntoday, Zach,\nis something known as plug and play.\n\n125\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.403\nDrivers are always important.\n\n126\n00:06:28.403 --> 00:06:31.641\nAnd we talked more about drivers,\nactually we'll be talking about drivers\n\n127\n00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.790\nreally through all the hardware and\ndefinitely in our operating system.\n\n128\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.490\nSee, one of the things you have to\nunderstand is that an operating system is\n\n129\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.130\na high level programming language.\n\n130\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.080\nAnd your programmers, that program in\nthose languages don't necessarily know all\n\n131\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.770\nthe details of the hardware.\n\n132\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.450\nAnd that's the benefit.\n\n133\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.410\nThey don't really have to.\n\n134\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.720\nWe leave the manufacturers of\nthe hardware to understand\n\n135\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.500\nhow to get the hardware online.\n\n136\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.085\nSo what you need is you need some\nkind of middle man, if you will, or\n\n137\n00:06:56.085 --> 00:06:58.343\nsome kind of middle translator.\n\n138\n00:06:58.343 --> 00:07:03.550\nSo for instance, I'd love to learn, and\nam still trying to learn to speak Spanish.\n\n139\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.160\nBut I don't really understand Spanish.\n\n140\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.329\nSo if I'm gonna speak to somebody\nthat is only fluent in Spanish but\n\n141\n00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.208\ndoesn't really understand English.\n\n142\n00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:13.236\nThen what I need is somebody\nthat understands Spanish and\n\n143\n00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:14.634\nEnglish at the same time.\n\n144\n00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.289\nAnd can sit between me and\nmy conversation with another person, and\n\n145\n00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:19.968\ncan translate for me.\n\n146\n00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:23.195\nSo to get to your question,\ndo we install and do we have to configure.\n\n147\n00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:26.570\nWhen we rely on plug-and-play, a lot of\ntimes what happens is your hardware and\n\n148\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.420\nyour software talk together.\n\n149\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.150\nAnd they can figure out what translators\nare needed, drivers if you will, and\n\n150\n00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.360\nthey can install them.\n\n151\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.870\nBut never underestimate the fact or\n\n152\n00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.500\nnever assume that a driver's gonna\nbe present through plug and play.\n\n153\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.748\nYou get your drivers for your hardware\ndevices directly from the manufacturer.\n\n154\n00:07:43.748 --> 00:07:46.285\nAnd any time you're gonna install\na device in a system unit,\n\n155\n00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:48.840\nyou wanna make sure that you have\nthe most up to date drivers.\n\n156\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.923\nBecause a lot of times, for instance in\na Windows based system, those drivers for\n\n157\n00:07:51.923 --> 00:07:54.172\nthe hardware are gonna be built\ninto the operating system.\n\n158\n00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:57.500\nBut it might not be the latest and\ngreatest drivers.\n\n159\n00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.413\nSo you might lose a little\nbit of functionality.\n\n160\n00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:03.500\nSo when you install these, always make\nsure that you have those drivers present.\n\n161\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.539\nNow that being said, let's go ahead.\n\n162\n00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:10.243\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a look at our very first\n\n163\n00:08:10.243 --> 00:08:12.691\nstorage medium type, all right?\n\n164\n00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:14.561\nAnd those are known as optical drives.\n\n165\n00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:19.810\nAgain, optical drives is a mechanical\ndrive that uses some form of laser\n\n166\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.120\nin order to burn the disks if you will,\nthe plastic disks that you insert in them.\n\n167\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.850\nAnd then keep in mind, like I said,\nit is a removable media type.\n\n168\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.590\nNow here's where it get a little tricky,\nbecause A+ is a lot about standards.\n\n169\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.350\nAnd you have to, again,\nprove that you understand the lingo.\n\n170\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.490\nSo there are some formats, standard\nformats, that you have to be aware of.\n\n171\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.190\nAnd you have to be ready to answer\nquestions about on the exam.\n\n172\n00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.470\nSo let's go ahead and dive into those.\n\n173\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.588\nI've got a little chart here on my screen.\n\n174\n00:08:48.588 --> 00:08:53.170\nAnd there are all different\ntypes of optical drives, right?\n\n175\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.343\nAnd CDs, right,\nwe'll take compact disks first.\n\n176\n00:08:58.343 --> 00:09:00.910\nCDs go back to around the mid 80s.\n\n177\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.060\nAgain, the drives to keep in mind,\nall of these drives, really,\n\n178\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.725\nare mechanical drives using\nsome kinda optical laser.\n\n179\n00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:09.381\nAll right, so what is a CD?\n\n180\n00:09:09.381 --> 00:09:10.776\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n181\n00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:19.280\nIt is a removable media source\nthat drive itself uses that laser.\n\n182\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.346\nNow CDs have a few different formats.\n\n183\n00:09:21.346 --> 00:09:23.996\nAnd we also have what are known as DVDs.\n\n184\n00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:28.925\nThey first were called digital\nvideo disks because they had\n\n185\n00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:34.170\nenough capacity on them that they\ncould store an entire video.\n\n186\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.560\nUnlike CDs, if you will, that had a much\nshorter or much smaller capacity size.\n\n187\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.390\nSo they were really, when they came out,\nthey were more for audio, if you will.\n\n188\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.460\nAnd then later, as they progressed, people\nwould not only be using uncompressed\n\n189\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.030\naudio, burning uncompressed audio, they\nwould also put data on them, likewise.\n\n190\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.740\nWhile DVDs, if you will, again\nbecause they had such a high capacity,\n\n191\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.880\nthey could store things like your movies,\nright?\n\n192\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.050\nThey can also store data, as well.\n\n193\n00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.485\nThe newer technology that we've been using\nfor while too is what is known as Blu-ray.\n\n194\n00:10:06.485 --> 00:10:10.490\nAnd Blu-ray, again,\nthink about the name, Blu-ray.\n\n195\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.382\nIt's a blue laser, right?\n\n196\n00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:16.924\nAnd the Blu-Ray is another one of those\noptical media sources that can store data.\n\n197\n00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:22.573\nBut one of the things that sets it\napart from something like your DVDs,\n\n198\n00:10:22.573 --> 00:10:26.305\nis the fact that,\nnot only can it store video,\n\n199\n00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:32.100\nit has such a large capacity that\nit can store high-definition video.\n\n200\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.523\nAnd that's really one of the things that\ndifferentiates it from the earlier DVDs\n\n201\n00:10:35.523 --> 00:10:38.460\nthat we have is the fact that\nthe capacities get greater, all right?\n\n202\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:44.393\nNow, that being said, you also have\nsome formats that you see inside of CDs,\n\n203\n00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:47.970\nDVDs, and yes, of course, Blue-rays too.\n\n204\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:53.085\nAnd you're gonna see, like I have up here,\na whole bunch of alphabet soup, right?\n\n205\n00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:59.613\nSo what do we mean when we talk\nabout CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW.\n\n206\n00:10:59.613 --> 00:11:02.832\nYou could see it here,\nDVD-ROM, if you will, R, RW.\n\n207\n00:11:02.832 --> 00:11:10.430\nAnd then, last, but of course not least,\nBlu-ray, you have BD-R and you have BD-RE.\n\n208\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.980\nAll right, so what the heck does that\nmean other than a bunch of letters in\n\n209\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.820\nthe alphabet?\n\n210\n00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.123\nAll right, let me help you out\non this because a lot of these\n\n211\n00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:19.492\nletters are synonymous with each other.\n\n212\n00:11:19.492 --> 00:11:23.560\nIt doesn't matter if it's CD or it's DVD.\n\n213\n00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.349\nAnd I love to help people out when they're\nmemorizing just a thousand miles of\n\n214\n00:11:28.349 --> 00:11:29.166\nstandards.\n\n215\n00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.842\nAnd make it easier that you\ncan study it one time and\n\n216\n00:11:31.842 --> 00:11:34.650\nremembered it across multiple standards.\n\n217\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.236\nIt's really gonna help accelerate your\ntraining when it comes to taking that A+\n\n218\n00:11:37.236 --> 00:11:37.816\ncertification.\n\n219\n00:11:37.816 --> 00:11:42.280\nIt can help you out in the exam booth\nwhen you decide sit in the hot seat.\n\n220\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.506\nAll right, so\nlet's look at those acronyms, right?\n\n221\n00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:46.412\nAll right, so we talked about ROM.\n\n222\n00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:49.041\nI don't care if we're\ntalking about CD-ROM,\n\n223\n00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.770\nI don't care if we're\ntalking about DVD-ROM.\n\n224\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.661\nRemember in our memory section, and again\nif you didn't see that, bump on over and\n\n225\n00:11:54.661 --> 00:11:56.535\ncheck it out,\nROM is read-only memory, all right?\n\n226\n00:11:56.535 --> 00:12:00.131\nNow in the context or\na format of an optical disc,\n\n227\n00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.490\nit means you can write to it once,\nall right?\n\n228\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.022\nYou can write to this optical or\nplastic disc one time.\n\n229\n00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:09.130\nNow what do you mean, write to it?\n\n230\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.810\nIt's not you that's actually writing\nto it, it's the manufacturer.\n\n231\n00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.950\nLet me give you an example.\n\n232\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.340\nWhen you put in, for instance,\na video game, right?\n\n233\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.420\nOr you put in a piece of software,\ncuz video games got so\n\n234\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.632\nbig that they couldn't just be on CDs,\nthey had to be on DVDs as well.\n\n235\n00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:29.315\nSo think about the earlier days when\nyou had a piece of software, right?\n\n236\n00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:33.580\nYou get your software CD, right,\nwhatever software it might be.\n\n237\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.110\nAnd it came from\nthe manufacturer that way.\n\n238\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.080\nBut you couldn't change\nany of the data on it.\n\n239\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.678\nYou couldn't manipulate\nthe data after the fact, right?\n\n240\n00:12:40.678 --> 00:12:43.480\nWhat you see is what you get essentially,\nright?\n\n241\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.187\nAnd that's what I mean when you say\nthat basically it's written to once.\n\n242\n00:12:47.187 --> 00:12:49.340\nBut it's not you that's doing it, right?\n\n243\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.201\nYou receive it and you're not\nactually doing the write at all.\n\n244\n00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:54.040\nAnd that's the same thing with DVDs.\n\n245\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.420\nI want you to take a DVD that's\n\n246\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.670\nmaybe a movie that you've got at\nhome that's on DVD, all right?\n\n247\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.420\nCan you turn around to that DVD, and\ncan you put it in a computer, and\n\n248\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.960\ncan you manipulate the data, right?\n\n249\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.680\nCan you add information to that DVD?\n\n250\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.060\nAnd the answer is no, right?\n\n251\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.101\nIt's because the manufacturer wrote\nthe information to that disk once.\n\n252\n00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:15.530\nAnd they had no intention of you\nmodifying it after the fact, right?\n\n253\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.823\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of movies\nI sure wish I could manipulate.\n\n254\n00:13:17.823 --> 00:13:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, change the endings and\nstuff like that.\n\n255\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.950\nMaybe the Sopranos, here.\n\n256\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.464\nBut that's neither here or\nthere, [LAUGH] right?\n\n257\n00:13:23.464 --> 00:13:26.250\nGood point though.\n\n258\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.631\nSo CD-ROM and DVD-ROM,\nladies and gentleman out there,\n\n259\n00:13:29.631 --> 00:13:31.190\ndon't let it confuse you.\n\n260\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.666\nIt just means it come from\nthe manufacturer that way, and\n\n261\n00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:35.582\nyou can't change anything after the fact.\n\n262\n00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:39.503\nNow, let's move over to the R, right?\n\n263\n00:13:39.503 --> 00:13:44.668\nAnd again, I don't care if it's a CD-R,\nright, or DVD-R.\n\n264\n00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:46.399\nThis is what's known as recordable,\nall right?\n\n265\n00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.750\nAnd now this is a little bit different.\n\n266\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.172\nThis is when you buy one\nof these optical disks.\n\n267\n00:13:51.172 --> 00:13:56.193\nAnd it is given to you or you buy it\nfrom let's say an office supply company.\n\n268\n00:13:56.193 --> 00:13:58.967\nIt's a blank CD or a blank DVD,\nit has nothing on it.\n\n269\n00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:03.177\nNo data, no videos, no movies or\nanything like that.\n\n270\n00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:06.456\nAnd you have the ability\nto write your data, right?\n\n271\n00:14:06.456 --> 00:14:10.154\nTo put it in the optical drive and\nto put data on that.\n\n272\n00:14:10.154 --> 00:14:15.896\nAnd this laser will burn that information,\nthey call them pits and lands, right?\n\n273\n00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:18.683\nThe raised areas is a land,\na pit is a lowered area.\n\n274\n00:14:18.683 --> 00:14:23.689\nAnd what the laser reads that as after\nits been written to is binary ones and\n\n275\n00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:24.910\nzeroes, right?\n\n276\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.510\nUp and down, up and down For\na 1 and 0, 1 and 0, right?\n\n277\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.470\nBut the one thing to keep in mind,\n\n278\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.250\nthe limiting factor of a recordable disk,\nwhether it be CD or DVD,\n\n279\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.172\nis the fact that you can't modify\nthe data after the fact, right.\n\n280\n00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:39.770\nYou only get one shot, right?\n\n281\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.248\nSo it means if you take a CD.\n\n282\n00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:46.366\nAnd you put just barely any information\non it, maybe a bread recipe,\n\n283\n00:14:46.366 --> 00:14:49.690\nright you're not gonna be\nable to add to it later.\n\n284\n00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.810\nSo you've got to take that\ninto consideration, right?\n\n285\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.355\nSo recordable is write once, read many,\nright, write once, read many.\n\n286\n00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:59.935\nIt's actually an acronym out there,\nbecause you do have things in like\n\n287\n00:14:59.935 --> 00:15:03.315\nforensics out there that they call WORM,\nWrite Once, Read Many.\n\n288\n00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:05.250\nIt means I can write the data once.\n\n289\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.920\nOnce that's done, it does what's known\nas mastering on the CDs if you will.\n\n290\n00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.641\nIt finalizes and then can verify\nthat the information is correct.\n\n291\n00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:16.460\nIt maintains integrity, and then you\ncan't manipulate it after the fact.\n\n292\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.120\nThen we get into RW.\n\n293\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:24.440\nNow with RW, RW is interesting, because\nin RW, that means rewritable, all right?\n\n294\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.003\nAnd what this means is that\njust like the recordable CDs or\n\n295\n00:15:29.003 --> 00:15:33.774\nDVDs, this means I can write\nthat information to the disk.\n\n296\n00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:37.790\nBut then I can turn around and\nI can write more information to the disk.\n\n297\n00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.008\nOr if I want, I could turn around and\nI can overwrite all of the information.\n\n298\n00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:47.000\nAnd completely fill up the CD or\nDVD again with new information, right?\n\n299\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.183\nThey're a little bit more expensive,\nbecause of the fact that they give you\n\n300\n00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:53.830\nthe flexibility of writing\nto them multiple times.\n\n301\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.351\nNow you do have to understand,\nwhen you can write to any media like this,\n\n302\n00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:59.199\nI don't care if it's optical media,\n\n303\n00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:03.037\nI don't care if it's mechanical magnetic\nmedia, Or even electronic media.\n\n304\n00:16:03.037 --> 00:16:06.837\nAnd when you do multiple writes, there is\nwhat they call a mean time between value.\n\n305\n00:16:06.837 --> 00:16:10.582\nThere's a lifetime that\nthis media will last.\n\n306\n00:16:10.582 --> 00:16:12.002\nI don't know what the lifetime is.\n\n307\n00:16:12.002 --> 00:16:17.450\nBut it just means over time the media\nmight start to wear out, right?\n\n308\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.235\nSo keep that in mind, it's not something\nthat just goes on, and on, and on.\n\n309\n00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:24.241\nAnd now I've seen rewritables that\nIf you're putting data on them,\n\n310\n00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:26.860\nthey'll allow you multiple rewrites.\n\n311\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.684\nAgain, it depends on the quality\nof the disk that you purchase.\n\n312\n00:16:30.684 --> 00:16:32.820\nBut it just means more than one write.\n\n313\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.683\nNow this last one is unique, the RE, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:37.683 --> 00:16:41.928\nThis one's specific to Blu-ray, but\nit means nothing different then RW.\n\n315\n00:16:41.928 --> 00:16:44.570\nIt's called Recordable Erasable, right?\n\n316\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.100\nAnd it means the same thing,\nessentially, as the RW is.\n\n317\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.662\nBut you don't find CD-RE or DVD-RE.\n\n318\n00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:56.483\nWhen Blu-Ray discs came out,\nthey decided to use the acronym BD-RE.\n\n319\n00:16:56.483 --> 00:16:58.103\nIt means the same thing as rewritable.\n\n320\n00:16:58.103 --> 00:17:02.823\nIt means I can write the Blu-ray diska and\nthen I can rewrite to the Blu-ray disk.\n\n321\n00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:06.651\nRecordable, Erasable,\ndon't let that confuse you.\n\n322\n00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.701\nNow when we talk about\nthese optical formats,\n\n323\n00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:11.023\nthere are some things that\nI want you to keep in mind.\n\n324\n00:17:11.023 --> 00:17:15.870\nI told you that they're different\nlaser types, if you will.\n\n325\n00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.064\nAnd the other thing that I also need you\nto understand is that they're different\n\n326\n00:17:19.064 --> 00:17:19.643\ncapacities.\n\n327\n00:17:19.643 --> 00:17:22.928\nAll right now CDs,\nyou will kinda find out,\n\n328\n00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:27.830\nthere's a limited capacity on how\nmuch information that they can hold.\n\n329\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.210\nThat's why in the earlier\ndays when CD's were so\n\n330\n00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.290\nprevalent, you would get a movie\nthat would have three disks, right?\n\n331\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.702\nAnd one would get done,\n\n332\n00:17:35.702 --> 00:17:40.441\njust like you keep it going back to VHS\nwhere you'd have two tapes for one movie.\n\n333\n00:17:40.441 --> 00:17:45.120\nIt's because you can only get,\nmost commonly, 700 megabytes of data.\n\n334\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.593\nNow, they've had all different kinds and\nall different standards.\n\n335\n00:17:47.593 --> 00:17:51.501\nSo I'll go ahead and\nkinda give you the ballpark figure.\n\n336\n00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:57.813\nAnywhere from 650 megabytes,\nif you will, to 900 MBs.\n\n337\n00:17:57.813 --> 00:18:02.126\nHowever, the most common disk is\n80 minutes of uncompressed audio.\n\n338\n00:18:02.126 --> 00:18:08.530\nAnd that really comes out to 700 megabyte\ncapacity, right, that's the maximum.\n\n339\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.380\nNow there is a rumor floating around\nthere that a Japanese inventor or\n\n340\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.640\nengineer actually found that capacity,\nor made that capacity\n\n341\n00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.960\nby saying that it must hold Beethoven's\nNinth Symphony in its entirety.\n\n342\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.032\nThat's a little conjecture,\nthat might be urban legend.\n\n343\n00:18:24.032 --> 00:18:26.460\nBut fun little facts.\n\n344\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.770\nIt won't do you anything on the A+ exam,\nbut\n\n345\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.400\nit might help you in\na Trivial Pursuit game.\n\n346\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.010\nSo keep that for\nyour Trivial Pursuit knowledge.\n\n347\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.790\nNow how do we determine how\nmuch information can be\n\n348\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.560\nput on these optical disks, right?\n\n349\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.970\nFrom the manufacturer, I mean,\nhow did the manufacturers do this?\n\n350\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.470\nWell a laser, essentially, if you\nbreak it down, is a wavelength, right?\n\n351\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.720\nIt's a wave, right?\n\n352\n00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.270\nAnd in these CDs\nthe wavelengths were very long.\n\n353\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.918\nThe longer the wavelength,\n\n354\n00:18:53.918 --> 00:18:57.083\nthe less information you can\nput on this disk, right?\n\n355\n00:18:57.083 --> 00:19:00.410\nI want you to think about\na spinning circle, right?\n\n356\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.320\nAnd if I take a string, right,\nand I put that string and\n\n357\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.710\nit start to spin around, right?\n\n358\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.464\nCentrically, right,\nI guess you would say, around a-\n\n359\n00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:10.852\n&gt;&gt; Centripically.\n\n360\n00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:15.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, around that CD,\nthe farther apart that that string is,\n\n361\n00:19:15.095 --> 00:19:18.250\nthe lesser the string\nyou could put on the CD.\n\n362\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.436\nSo the wire, or that circle.\n\n363\n00:19:20.436 --> 00:19:22.501\nSo the wider the wavelength, right,\n\n364\n00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:25.090\nthe less information you\ncould put on it right?\n\n365\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.571\nAnd you don't have to worry about this,\nbut kinda give you an example.\n\n366\n00:19:28.571 --> 00:19:33.740\nCDs were in 780 nanometer, nanometers,\nyou know, how we measure wavelengths.\n\n367\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.010\nAbout 780 nanometer wavelength, right?\n\n368\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.360\nWhen DVD's come out, it's more compressed.\n\n369\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.470\nThe wavelength is more compressed, right?\n\n370\n00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.977\nNow we talk about if you have a spinning\ncircle and you drop a string on it.\n\n371\n00:19:44.977 --> 00:19:48.769\nAnd that string starts to work\nit's way around that DVD,\n\n372\n00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:51.220\nit's gonna have a tighter pattern.\n\n373\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.190\nSo that means the data's compressed more.\n\n374\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.967\nYou can put more information on it, right?\n\n375\n00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:56.064\nThat's important.\n\n376\n00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:57.425\nNow when you get into DVD's,\n\n377\n00:19:57.425 --> 00:20:01.030\nI want you to understand that there are\nfew different types that they call out.\n\n378\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.671\nIn fact, if we can kinda go back to my\nscreen, you're gonna see that there are.\n\n379\n00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.800\nAnd you know, they don't mention,\nI don't have it up here.\n\n380\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.400\nBut there's another one that I wanna\nkinda talk about is DVD RW-DL.\n\n381\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.150\nWith the DVDs,\nthey can have multiple densities,\n\n382\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.200\nwhich means multiple layers\nthat they can write to.\n\n383\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.450\nAnd the more layers you have, the more\ndata you can compress on a single DVD.\n\n384\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.630\nMost commonly what you're gonna\nfind when you go to a store and\n\n385\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:32.200\nyou buy a DVD optical disk,\nis you're gonna find for a single sided.\n\n386\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.370\nAnd when we talk about single sided,\n\n387\n00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.874\nit's kinda like we were talking about\nwith the memory with the record player.\n\n388\n00:20:35.874 --> 00:20:37.770\nYou can pull it out, turn it over,\nand put it back in and\n\n389\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.290\nit can read you the other side.\n\n390\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.420\nIf you talk about a single sided DVD,\nyou're\n\n391\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.910\ntalking 4.7 gigabytes of information\non a single DVD, one-sided, right?\n\n392\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.732\nThat's a lot more than just\na 700 megabyte, right?\n\n393\n00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:51.880\nWe're talking a lot of information.\n\n394\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.823\nIf you have one of the dual-sided,\nright, or excuse me, single-sided,\n\n395\n00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.780\ndual-layer, right?\n\n396\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.420\nSo now we just have a single side, but\nthere's multiple writing layers, right?\n\n397\n00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.699\nThat one's gonna be one that's\n8.5 gigabytes of capacity.\n\n398\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.044\nBut now here it gets a little tricky.\n\n399\n00:21:11.044 --> 00:21:15.415\nWe have double-sided with single layers.\n\n400\n00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:18.792\nAnd that just means I've got one\nwriting layer that I can write to, and\n\n401\n00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:19.887\nthat's 4.7 gigs.\n\n402\n00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:23.294\nWe can take that optical disk out and\nturn it over.\n\n403\n00:21:23.294 --> 00:21:25.250\nAnd we can write to the other side.\n\n404\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.054\nWell, guess what, it just doubles it.\n\n405\n00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:29.062\nIt goes from 4.7 gigs to 9.4 gigs, right?\n\n406\n00:21:29.062 --> 00:21:31.490\nIt's 4.7 on each side.\n\n407\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.633\nNow one of the ones that are very rare and\nthey're not really found in the market.\n\n408\n00:21:35.633 --> 00:21:39.644\nYou can see these a lot of times\ncoming from the manufacturer,\n\n409\n00:21:39.644 --> 00:21:42.150\nare what are known as single-sided.\n\n410\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.260\nAnd you'll see DL,\nit might say dual layer or double layer.\n\n411\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.440\nNot single-sided, excuse me,\ndouble-sided, double layer or dual layer.\n\n412\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.860\nThese mean you have two of those\nwriting surfaces on each side.\n\n413\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:01.600\nThose would go up to 17 gigabytes\nof data on a single DVD.\n\n414\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.830\nThat's a lot of information\non one little optical disc.\n\n415\n00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.460\nHowever, they're very rare.\n\n416\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.760\nI only throw them out here for\n\n417\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.650\nthe exam purposes in case you come\nacross it on the exam, right?\n\n418\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:17.690\nThe most common ones that we find\nare the single-sided, single layer,\n\n419\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:22.550\n4.7 gigs, or single-layer,\ndouble sided, right?\n\n420\n00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:27.840\n4.7 gigs on each side, tally it up,\ntotal it up, it is 9.4 gigabytes, right?\n\n421\n00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.915\nSo I definitely want\nyou to remember those.\n\n422\n00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:33.052\nAnd to kinda give you an idea\nabout the wavelengths,\n\n423\n00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:35.622\nyou're gonna see that the wavelength\nis shorter on this one.\n\n424\n00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:37.952\nAnd, again, I don't want you to\nworry about the wavelengths.\n\n425\n00:22:37.952 --> 00:22:40.528\nJust for the concept and the theory.\n\n426\n00:22:40.528 --> 00:22:47.990\nWe go from 780 nanometers in a CD\ndown to 650 nanometers in a DVD.\n\n427\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.218\nSo you can see that the compression\nof the information,\n\n428\n00:22:51.218 --> 00:22:53.218\nthe more you can compact, right?\n\n429\n00:22:53.218 --> 00:22:55.414\nI want you to think of that\nfile cabinet that you open up.\n\n430\n00:22:55.414 --> 00:22:59.410\nAnd it's got loose files in it,\nright, being like the CD, right?\n\n431\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.811\nIf I take those files and\nI push them all the way to the back,\n\n432\n00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:05.255\nI now have a little bit more information.\n\n433\n00:23:05.255 --> 00:23:07.800\nAnd I can put some more\nfiles in that file cabinet.\n\n434\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.130\nIt's kind of like what's\ngoing on with those lasers.\n\n435\n00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.600\nThe shorter the wavelength,\n\n436\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.330\nthink of it as data compression,\nwe're squeezing that data.\n\n437\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.580\nAnd we can get a lot more\ninformation on that optical disk.\n\n438\n00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.832\nThe last one is Blu-ray.\n\n439\n00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:22.976\nAnd Blu-ray, just like I said,\nagain, it is a blue laser.\n\n440\n00:23:22.976 --> 00:23:27.194\nThese were originally before,\nand I don't know the company,\n\n441\n00:23:27.194 --> 00:23:29.032\nI think Sony was part of it.\n\n442\n00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:31.583\nPhillips Magnavox might have been\nanother one that was part of it too.\n\n443\n00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:35.380\nThey're Sony-Philips today, but Sony was\ndefinitely on the forefront of this.\n\n444\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.070\nThey called them high\ndensity optical disks in\n\n445\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.300\nthe earlier days until they settled\non the marketing name if you will,\n\n446\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.880\nBlue ray,\nbased on the blue laser that it is.\n\n447\n00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.041\nThese are also removable storage.\n\n448\n00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:49.340\nThey started somewhere\nin the early 2000's.\n\n449\n00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.631\nAnd they've been constantly\nbeing optimized and\n\n450\n00:23:51.631 --> 00:23:53.984\nthey're increasing their\ncapacities every day.\n\n451\n00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:58.930\nThat wavelength is almost half Half of\nwhat the original CDs were that were\n\n452\n00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:04.940\nreleased in the 80s, we're talking 405\nnanometers, ultra compact, all right?\n\n453\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.310\nSo because of that, they can compress a\nlot information on a single Blu-ray disk.\n\n454\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.585\nAnd they also have technologies,\nthrough the encoding and how they\n\n455\n00:24:12.585 --> 00:24:16.616\nwrite the information, it allows for\nvery crystal clear audio and video, right?\n\n456\n00:24:16.616 --> 00:24:22.260\nSo very, very good for our modern\nhigh definition video that we watch.\n\n457\n00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.320\nNow the way they work,\nthey work in multiple layers,\n\n458\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.330\nkind of like that DVD does on one side.\n\n459\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.500\nIt can have multiple writing layers,\njust in a single side.\n\n460\n00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.110\nAnd they're single layer,\nthey're dual layer, and\n\n461\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.850\nthere's another one out\nthere that's called BDXL.\n\n462\n00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:42.400\nAnd again, that's extra layer or\nextra large, I think.\n\n463\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.670\nBut it's BDXL format.\n\n464\n00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:50.810\nEvery layer, this might help you\non the exam, a single sided, and\n\n465\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:56.370\nexcuse me single layer and a dual layer\nare really just double of each other.\n\n466\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:03.280\nIf I have a single layer Blu-ray disk,\nI get 25 gigabytes in a single layer.\n\n467\n00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.064\nVersus the biggest DVD which you've never\nreally seen too much of that you can\n\n468\n00:25:08.064 --> 00:25:09.544\nget 17 gigs, right?\n\n469\n00:25:09.544 --> 00:25:14.479\nSo you can see,\nthere was a big I guess you would say war\n\n470\n00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:17.790\nif you will for the storage medium.\n\n471\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.269\nThe next greatest format that\nwas gonna win out, right?\n\n472\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.430\nMaybe some of you guys are old enough\nto remember, some of you might not be,\n\n473\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.270\nthat there was a Betamax VHS competition.\n\n474\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.080\n&gt;&gt; The Betamax.\n\n475\n00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.360\nMy goodness, really?\n\n476\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.132\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n477\n00:25:30.132 --> 00:25:33.790\nAnd Betamax kind of lost overnight and\n\n478\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.020\na lot of the people don't even\nremember it because VHS won out.\n\n479\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.920\nWell, towards the end of\nDVDs being considered what\n\n480\n00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.880\nwas gonna be a continued thing for\nhigh definition,\n\n481\n00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.840\nthey did briefly have what was\nknown as an HD DVD, right?\n\n482\n00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.780\nAnd they, I don't know who it was,\nToshiba or\n\n483\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.720\nsomebody like that was\nactually promoting that.\n\n484\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.900\nAnd by the end of the year,\nthey were making products at the beginning\n\n485\n00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.460\nof the year or the beginning of\nthe quarter and by the end of the quarter,\n\n486\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.780\nthey have completely abandoned it and\nhopped off to Blu-ray.\n\n487\n00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.200\nSo it's again, just competing formats,\nit is something I want you to remember.\n\n488\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.790\nNow there are file systems.\n\n489\n00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.182\nNow, what is a file system?\n\n490\n00:26:12.182 --> 00:26:15.290\nAll right, I want you to think of\na file system as a logical structure on\n\n491\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.122\nhow we can write and read the data.\n\n492\n00:26:17.122 --> 00:26:20.620\nAll right, think about it,\nI don't care what language you are.\n\n493\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.240\nI hope you are watching in English,\nbecause that's what I'm speaking,\n\n494\n00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.940\nbut doesn't matter what\nlanguage you speak, right?\n\n495\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.830\nYou have a format, you have an alphabet,\n\n496\n00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.480\nyou have a structure to how\nthe language is written, right?\n\n497\n00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.453\nWell it is the same thing\nwith these optical drives.\n\n498\n00:26:36.453 --> 00:26:42.480\nThey have a format of how the information\nis written to and read from the media.\n\n499\n00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.278\nAnd we have got some different formats\nthat I want you to be aware of.\n\n500\n00:26:45.278 --> 00:26:49.156\nIn the original ones for\nCDs it was called CDFS.\n\n501\n00:26:49.156 --> 00:26:52.450\nYes I know another acronym, and\nit is compact disk file system.\n\n502\n00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.780\nNow compact disk file system was really\ngood for uncompressed audio, but\n\n503\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.080\nit did have some limitations.\n\n504\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.690\nSo they came out with another format and\nthat's the universal disk format and\n\n505\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.410\nfrom then on, most of all of\nyour optical drives support UDF.\n\n506\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.540\nSame thing with DVD.\n\n507\n00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.000\nDVD doesn't support CDFS, that was\nsomething in the very early days just for\n\n508\n00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.210\nCDs.\n\n509\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.120\nIt supports the universal disk format.\n\n510\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.925\nSame thing with with Blu-ray.\n\n511\n00:27:20.925 --> 00:27:25.680\nBlu-ray started out I wanna say UDF 2.5\nis when Blu-ray kind of came on board and\n\n512\n00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.930\nthey still have UDF today as well.\n\n513\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.900\nAll right, these are just some of\nthe things that we have to understand,\n\n514\n00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.840\nbut Zach's giving me that eye over there.\n\n515\n00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.391\nBoy I've talked a lot about\noptical disks and lasers and\n\n516\n00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:38.779\nwe didn't even mention\na single Star Wars reference,\n\n517\n00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:41.288\nbut it does look like we might\nhave to go into a part two.\n\n518\n00:27:41.288 --> 00:27:44.392\n&gt;&gt; I didn't have a chance\nto get in there with that.\n\n519\n00:27:44.392 --> 00:27:48.483\nBut install and configure storage devices,\nso this is part one and\n\n520\n00:27:48.483 --> 00:27:52.136\npart two will be coming up very,\nvery soon in A+ 901.\n\n521\n00:27:52.136 --> 00:27:54.856\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n522\n00:27:54.856 --> 00:27:57.920\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n523\n00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.740\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n524\n00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.430\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:08.233\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.900\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.300\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.430\nI'm your host Zach Memos as\nwe continue on with A+ 901.\n\n8\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.425\nInstall and configure storage devices.\n\n9\n00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.368\nThis is part two.\n\n10\n00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:30.762\nWe had part one, and now we're gonna\npick it up right here with, probably,\n\n11\n00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:32.418\nmagnetic hard disk drives.\n\n12\n00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:35.770\nAnd Wes Bryan is the man bringing you\nall the information you need to know.\n\n13\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.062\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zack, thanks for\nhaving me back, that is right.\n\n14\n00:00:38.062 --> 00:00:42.331\nWe've got a lot of different\nstorage mediums to talk about.\n\n15\n00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.660\nLike Zach said in the first episode we\ntalked a lot about the optical drives.\n\n16\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.750\nRemember we have three\nprimary storage types that\n\n17\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.150\nreally are something that\nyou're gonna need to know.\n\n18\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.070\nNot only in the real world but\nalso pass that A+ exam.\n\n19\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.310\nRemember, we talked about\noptical drives in the first one.\n\n20\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.510\nWe have a laser that is\nwriting to removable media to\n\n21\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.260\nmechanical drive, right?\n\n22\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.400\nWe mentioned magnetic media and\nagain, that's a mechanical type drive\n\n23\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.807\nthat uses some kind of electromagnet\nenergy to store and read information.\n\n24\n00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:13.720\nAnd then we also have electronic storage.\n\n25\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.990\nSo, what we're gonna dive into first,\nagain, like Zach said,\n\n26\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.100\nis the magnetic media.\n\n27\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.198\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right in there.\n\n28\n00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:20.823\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n29\n00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:22.659\n&gt;&gt; Now, when we talk about magnet media,\n\n30\n00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.990\nthere are different\ntypes of magnetic media.\n\n31\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.070\nThere are what originally we had very\nearly on when it came to removable media,\n\n32\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.160\nwhich is actually the predecessor,\nif you will,\n\n33\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.910\nto the optical disk were what\nwere known as floppy disks.\n\n34\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.043\nIn the earlier days, these floppy disks\ncould be up to eight inches long,\n\n35\n00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.782\npretty much looks like you could\nroof a house with them, right.\n\n36\n00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:44.138\nThey were very, very big, looks like\na shingle out there on your roof.\n\n37\n00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:47.660\nAs time progressed,\neverything's getting smaller and smaller.\n\n38\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.990\nYou probably have maybe seen that over\nthe years, if you look at pictures\n\n39\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.140\nout there on the internet of old computers\nand stuff everything seems to get smaller.\n\n40\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.070\nThen we would have the five and\na quarter inch floppy disc and\n\n41\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.380\nthen finally before they pretty much CD\nmarked the pretty much the death blow for\n\n42\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.965\nthe floppies three in a half inch.\n\n43\n00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.792\nThat's a magnetic type media.\n\n44\n00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:13.761\nNow what we have for internal storage and\nthis is internal and external,\n\n45\n00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:17.470\nexternal meaning that you can plug\nit into an external system port or\n\n46\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.030\nconnection on the outside\nof the system case.\n\n47\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.996\nInternal meaning, it's plugged\ndirectly into the motherboard,\n\n48\n00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:26.630\nis what are known as hard disk drives.\n\n49\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.346\nNow in this episode I want you to\nunderstand that what we're gonna do\n\n50\n00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:34.323\nis we're just really kind of letting\nyou know what the technology is more\n\n51\n00:02:34.323 --> 00:02:35.251\nin theory type.\n\n52\n00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.350\nWe do have another episode where we're\ngonna talk about the specifics of\n\n53\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.251\nthe different technologies for\nhard disk drives.\n\n54\n00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:45.563\nWe just kinda want you to understand,\nwhat kind of storage mediums we have,\n\n55\n00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:47.064\nwhat kind of storage devices, and\n\n56\n00:02:47.064 --> 00:02:51.120\nthen we'll get a little more specific in a\nlater episode on those actual connections.\n\n57\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.160\nSo what is a hard disk drive?\n\n58\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.020\nMagnetic media if you will.\n\n59\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.658\nI've got a little picture here, and one of\nthe things that you can see is that these\n\n60\n00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:03.172\nhard disc drives, right, little boxes\nthat you see inside of your computer.\n\n61\n00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:06.226\nThey're actually made up of\na series of platters, right,\n\n62\n00:03:06.226 --> 00:03:10.325\na lot like a record player was,\nif you look at the record players, right.\n\n63\n00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.385\nAnd it has this little actuator arm.\n\n64\n00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:15.390\nAnd this actuator arm floats back and\nforth, right.\n\n65\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.020\nThe actuator arm is actually\nwhat is responsible for\n\n66\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.750\nusing electromagnetic energy to\nbasically put a charge if you will.\n\n67\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.030\nA magnetic charge on\ndifferent locations and\n\n68\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.840\npoints across these what\nare known as platters right?\n\n69\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.884\nAnd these platters do spin,\njust like a record player.\n\n70\n00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:35.225\nAnd they either are putting\na charge onto that platter, or\n\n71\n00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:38.580\nthey're just reading the charge\nthat's there, right.\n\n72\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.620\nThat's how it distinguishes our\nbinary information, our binary bits,\n\n73\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.740\nif you will, ones and zeros.\n\n74\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.700\nNow, one of the things I want\nyou to keep in mind is this\n\n75\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.080\nactuator arm that you see is a lot\nlike a record player needle.\n\n76\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.278\nThere's a slight difference in the fact\nthat it sits off of these platters,\n\n77\n00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:56.403\nits in the microns.\n\n78\n00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.340\nAnd micron is one millionth of a meter.\n\n79\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.768\nAnd we say a micron, we're talking\nabout so close to those platters,\n\n80\n00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:07.908\nessentially, that even\nsomething as thin as an ash.\n\n81\n00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:11.866\nFitting in between there could actually\nscratch the platters themselves.\n\n82\n00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:15.772\nAnd what happens is that as the platter\nspin, this actuator motor actually\n\n83\n00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:19.802\nmoves back and forth and it's reading\ndifferent points across the platter or\n\n84\n00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:22.060\nwriting information with a charge.\n\n85\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.610\nOn different points across these platters\nto either again write or read your data.\n\n86\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.200\nAnd they're actually kind of impressive,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.600\nI heard an analogy one time to, your hard\ndisk drives and it went something like\n\n88\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.325\nthis, it said, if we had a technology that\nwe can compare this to on how specific and\n\n89\n00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:43.435\nhow precise a magnetic hard drive is,\na hard disk drive.\n\n90\n00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:48.545\nIt would be like flying a 747,\na foot off the ground\n\n91\n00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:52.815\nfrom Florida here all the way to\nCalifornia and counting every single\n\n92\n00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:57.380\nblade of grass that it crossed\npaths with from that entire trip.\n\n93\n00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.722\nBeing able to count every\nsingle blade of grass, right?\n\n94\n00:04:59.722 --> 00:05:01.157\nIt's a very impressive technology.\n\n95\n00:05:01.157 --> 00:05:02.100\n&gt;&gt; Daunting.\n\n96\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.750\n&gt;&gt; Again,\nit's on a micro-scale if you will,\n\n97\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.970\nversus the 747 macro-scale if you will.\n\n98\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.556\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But very very important.\n\n99\n00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:14.810\nNow, the only thing that they really\ncall out here in the objectives, right,\n\n100\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.850\nis the fact that magnetic\ndiscs turn at a certain speed.\n\n101\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.384\nLike I said, those of you guys and girls,\nthat are out there looking for, maybe,\n\n102\n00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:26.429\nthe specifics on the connections types\nthat these hard disc drives use.\n\n103\n00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:30.710\nWe are gonna go into what's know\nas the PC connection episode, and\n\n104\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.380\nwe'll really look at the technologies like\nSeraial ATA, SATA Drive, if you will.\n\n105\n00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.401\nWe'll talk briefly about the old\npredecessor there Parralel ATA drive\n\n106\n00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:41.077\nand stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:44.280\nThose are the connections that\nthese magnetic disks use.\n\n108\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.840\nAnd we'll get definitely\nmore specific on that.\n\n109\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.830\nWhat I want you to know is that\nthese disks as they spin faster,\n\n110\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.180\nit gives you a better performance right?\n\n111\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.490\nThe faster the disk, the more information\nthat can be written to the drive.\n\n112\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.449\nAgain placed on the drive through\nelectromagnetic charge or\n\n113\n00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.860\ncan be read off of the drive, right?\n\n114\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.480\nWhen it's read off, it's read and\nsent across the motherboard into memory.\n\n115\n00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.890\nAnd then, the CPU can use it.\n\n116\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.132\nWhen the CPU is done computing\nthe results of that information,\n\n117\n00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:14.193\nit comes out of memory,\ncomes back around the motherboard,\n\n118\n00:06:14.193 --> 00:06:18.411\nand gets stored with that magnetic charge\non the disk, that if we pulled the power.\n\n119\n00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:23.540\nWell we could turn around and we could\nuse that information in the future.\n\n120\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.604\nNow I do wanna mention of this okay,\nbecause it doesn't matter what storage\n\n121\n00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:30.790\ndevice you're using,\nespecially with hard disk drives.\n\n122\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.280\nIf you do pull the power in the middle\nof a right operation then what\n\n123\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.340\nyou potentially get is corrupt information\nbecause it very, very precise.\n\n124\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.515\nAnd it is moving very, very fast,\n\n125\n00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:45.180\nlike you can almost see the points on\nhow fast it's moving, and it blurs.\n\n126\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.327\nSo you do run the risk that\nif you pull the power,\n\n127\n00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:49.207\nI said you can use the information later,\n\n128\n00:06:49.207 --> 00:06:52.770\nif it's in the middle of a write operation\nyou might corrupt the information.\n\n129\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.910\nSo or the data that's being placed on it.\n\n130\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.054\nDon't let me mislead you in the fact that\njust because you pulled the power on\n\n131\n00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:03.049\nthe system unit that you can\nactually get to that data.\n\n132\n00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:04.641\nYou could corrupt the information.\n\n133\n00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:06.667\nSo you really don't wanna do that.\n\n134\n00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:10.788\nAnytime you shut a computer down you want\nto perform what's known as a graceful\n\n135\n00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:11.570\nshutdown.\n\n136\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.000\nA graceful shutdown means the operating\nsystem closes itself down and then\n\n137\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.350\nthe hardware sequentially turns itself\noff so you don't get data corruption.\n\n138\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.105\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question.\n\n139\n00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So it's in RPM's.\n\n140\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.918\n&gt;&gt; That's right, revolutions per minute.\n\n141\n00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:26.895\n&gt;&gt; So is there a way to\ncalibrate the actual memory or\n\n142\n00:07:26.895 --> 00:07:28.721\nthe amount of memory, or no?\n\n143\n00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:29.990\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.\n\n144\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.912\nThis is, and it really doesn't have\nto Too much to do with the memory,\n\n145\n00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:38.105\nper se, because the memory is something\nthat is our temporary work bench.\n\n146\n00:07:38.105 --> 00:07:39.012\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And really,\n\n147\n00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:41.434\nwhen it comes to the RPMs and\neven the drives, there's that,\n\n148\n00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:42.700\nyou can't really do anything.\n\n149\n00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.313\nI think of the cordless drill.\n\n150\n00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:45.730\nAnd that might be what you're thinking of.\n\n151\n00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.279\nThe cordless drill has got a variable\nspeed, right, the more we push it,\n\n152\n00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.929\nthe faster it goes we don't\nreally set these, right?\n\n153\n00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:54.940\nThe manufacturer sets them and\nits a specification.\n\n154\n00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.617\nAnd I'm glad you asked that because\nyou have to check the specification on\n\n155\n00:07:58.617 --> 00:08:02.487\nthe hard drive itself And it will tell\nyou, it will tell you what the RPMs are.\n\n156\n00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:06.373\nAnd there are really three RPMs that they\ncall out here, and I want to go ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:08.978\ntalk about them each individually.\n\n158\n00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:13.100\nYou have 5,400 RPM, revolutions per\nminute, I want you to think about those\n\n159\n00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.974\nplatters, those platters that are running,\nthat are spinning, right?\n\n160\n00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:21.994\n5,400 RPMs means 5,400\nrotations per minute.\n\n161\n00:08:21.994 --> 00:08:23.944\nYou also have 7,200 RPM as well.\n\n162\n00:08:23.944 --> 00:08:28.666\nAnd 7,200 RPM again faster that\nplatter spins the faster we can get to\n\n163\n00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:33.330\ninformation, the faster we can read and\nwrite information if you will.\n\n164\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.370\nThen they also have 10,000 RPMs.\n\n165\n00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.570\nNow when we talk about 10,000 RPMs we\nhave to be careful with these drives\n\n166\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.990\nbecause these drives are, for\na mechanical drive, are ultra fast.\n\n167\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.660\nHowever, because they spin so fast you\nhave two things you have to keep in mind\n\n168\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.520\non any system that you're gonna use these\nin, temperature, and noise, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.880\nTemperature because the faster it's\nspinning, the hotter the device might get.\n\n170\n00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.427\nIn fact we had some of these older, we\ndon't have them right now cuz we kinda go\n\n171\n00:09:01.427 --> 00:09:03.624\nonto solid state which\nwe'll talk about soon.\n\n172\n00:09:03.624 --> 00:09:05.809\nI work for a company that did have these,\n\n173\n00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:08.970\nthey were called 10,000\nRPM VelociRaptor drives.\n\n174\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.350\nAnd they were smoking.\n\n175\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.110\nI mean, they would move.\n\n176\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.990\nThey also have other ones out there that\nare on the market too, like 15,000 RPMs.\n\n177\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.180\nBut as of the objectives\nthat we have today,\n\n178\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.837\nyou don't have to worry about 15,000 RPMs.\n\n179\n00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:24.630\n10,000 RPM drives are very,\nvery expensive,\n\n180\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:30.360\nthey're again sometimes the more\nexpensive then you can justify the cost.\n\n181\n00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.890\nThe other thing I mentioned too is with\nthe increased RMPs you get noise, right?\n\n182\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.070\nNow you might be thinking well,\nwhat's the problem with noise?\n\n183\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.600\nWell I want you to think about a laptop,\nall right.\n\n184\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.740\nIf you have a laptop,\none of the things that they don't want to\n\n185\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.470\nhappen is they don't want to\nhave to increase the power\n\n186\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.100\nthat it takes to power the components\nbecause what does that do in your laptop?\n\n187\n00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.910\nIt shortens your battery life, right.\n\n188\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.660\nWhen it comes to laptop computing there's\ntwo major contributing factors right\n\n189\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.190\nproper thermal management, right.\n\n190\n00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.168\nWe don't want overheating.\n\n191\n00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:03.360\nWhich a 10,000 RPM drive is\ngonna increase the heating.\n\n192\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.020\nYou would have to increase\nthe cooling system.\n\n193\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.418\nA laptop's really concerned with,\nyou want to make them silent.\n\n194\n00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:14.860\nIn fact, Zach and\nI have laptops on right now.\n\n195\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.110\nAnd even if I was to bend this\nmicrophone down to the laptop,\n\n196\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.570\nat best you would be able to hear the fan.\n\n197\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.270\nBut you're not going to\nhear more than that.\n\n198\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.920\nAnd that's because of the fact that\nlaptops are meant to be silent.\n\n199\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.348\nThe other thing that you might see too is\nthat you might have some kind of system\n\n200\n00:10:27.348 --> 00:10:29.846\nthat you're using or\nbuilding for voice recognition.\n\n201\n00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.831\nAnd if you got a very loud machine,\n\n202\n00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:36.570\nit might interfere with things like voice\nrecognition technology that's on it.\n\n203\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.600\nNow in Enterprise, right, for\ninstance back here at ITPRO.TV,\n\n204\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.190\nwe have a server closet over there,\nwe don't really care about the noise.\n\n205\n00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.920\nServers are loud, very loud.\n\n206\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.530\nIn fact so loud that if you get into\na bank of like a thousand servers,\n\n207\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.610\nthey're deafening.\n\n208\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.288\nBut that's okay again, because they're\nbehind an isolated data center,\n\n209\n00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:58.170\nbehind isolated rooms,\nsecurity, security if you will.\n\n210\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.972\nAnd we don't care about that as\nfar as it comes to the noise.\n\n211\n00:11:03.972 --> 00:11:08.062\nSo, you can see them,\nyou can buy them, 10,000 RPM drives.\n\n212\n00:11:08.062 --> 00:11:11.479\nBut a lot of times you're gonna see those\nhigher RPM drives are gonna be in things\n\n213\n00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:12.860\nlike your server environment.\n\n214\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.218\nBecause for example the cost and\n\n215\n00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:21.110\njust the sheer noise that's behind them.\n\n216\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.700\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; What's a hot swappable drive?\n\n217\n00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.440\nCould we get that?\n\n218\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.330\n&gt;&gt; That is another great concept too, and\nit's actually a very convenient concept.\n\n219\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.570\nAnd hot swappable,\nwhen we talk about hot swappable.\n\n220\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.863\nAll right, you have cold swapping,\nyou have warm swapping and\n\n221\n00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.970\nyou have hot swapping, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.300\nAnd really, what they just call out here\nis hot swapping, but let's go ahead and\n\n223\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.680\ntalk about the three different types,\nall right?\n\n224\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.750\nIf I need to replace a video\ncard in a system unit,\n\n225\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.810\nthat is a cold swappable device,\nand what do I mean by that?\n\n226\n00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.310\nI can't, while the machine is\nunder power open the system unit.\n\n227\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.740\nYou shouldn't do that anyway, because\nof the electrical hazard that that is.\n\n228\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.280\nI can't open that case and\n\n229\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.150\nremove that video card while\nthe machine is turned on, right?\n\n230\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.740\nSo that is a cold swappable device.\n\n231\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.390\nHowever, if I have a serial ATA drive,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.730\nAnd, again, we'll get into our PCA,\nor our PC connections, and\n\n233\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.850\ntalk more about those hard drive types.\n\n234\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.730\nAnd I have multiple hard drives that are\naggregated together in a single system and\n\n235\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.570\nI find that that hard drive has failed.\n\n236\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.561\nWell, I can reach in there and I can pull\nthat hard drive in out while the system is\n\n237\n00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:31.260\nstill under power, and\nreplace it with another one.\n\n238\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.160\nAnd I never had to turn the computer off,\nright, that is cold swap.\n\n239\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.020\nThey also have warm swap, it's like for\n\n240\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.180\ninstance when your system\nis in a low powered state.\n\n241\n00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.130\nBut that one right there we don't\nhave to worry about as well.\n\n242\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.650\nKnow that hot swapping is the ability to\n\n243\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.880\nreplace any device while the system\nunit is still maintaining power.\n\n244\n00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.940\nNow you can find this in your\nhome based desktops, right.\n\n245\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.190\nA lot of times you'll see this in multi\ndisk systems that are using a redundant\n\n246\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.445\narray of independent disks.\n\n247\n00:12:56.445 --> 00:12:59.416\nArray which we'll talk about\ncoming up here in a bit.\n\n248\n00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:02.890\nAnd you can all definitely find this\ninside of things like your enterprise\n\n249\n00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:03.680\nenvironments.\n\n250\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.318\nBecause when you have these\ncomputers if you will,\n\n251\n00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:11.390\nservers computers if you will\nthat have multiple disks.\n\n252\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:16.990\nI mean 15, 20, 100 different hard drives,\nand a technician comes in, and they see\n\n253\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.950\na blinking red light on the face of one of\nthose drives, signaling a drive failure.\n\n254\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.900\nThey don't want to have to turn\nthe whole entire system off, right?\n\n255\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.830\nBecause time is money, and anytime you\ndon't have data, access to your data,\n\n256\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.040\nyour company runs the risk\nof losing information.\n\n257\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.683\nSo what they can do is, they can remove\nthat hard drive, while the system's\n\n258\n00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:40.730\nstill powered on, right, and\nthen they can put the new drive in place.\n\n259\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.207\nHere's another component\nthat is hot-swappable and\n\n260\n00:13:43.207 --> 00:13:45.640\nyou probably use it on a daily basis,\nor maybe you do.\n\n261\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.780\nYou ever have a little thumb drive,\nyou plug it into your machine.\n\n262\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.720\nDid you have to turn off your\nmachine to plug it in, or unplug it?\n\n263\n00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720\nThe answer is no.\n\n264\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.630\nUSB, your USB based devices,\n\n265\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.380\nlittle thumb drives, these\nare examples of hot swappable devices.\n\n266\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.670\nI can plug them into the machine.\n\n267\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.100\nThe machine is still under power and\n\n268\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.480\nat the same time I have the ability to\nunplug the devices, likewise, through\n\n269\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.700\ncertain safe means without actually\npowering the whole entire system down.\n\n270\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.470\nSo those are hot swappable.\n\n271\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Solid state flash drives, you kind of\nmentioned solid state a while ago, or?\n\n272\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n273\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.330\nThat is what I mentioned when I\nsaid electronic drives, right?\n\n274\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.610\nWe have electronic storage, too.\n\n275\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.860\nAnd electronic storage is\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n276\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.440\nIt means we're not using magnetic energy.\n\n277\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.220\nWe're not using an optical light source,\nright?\n\n278\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.760\nTo read or write the information.\n\n279\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.100\nOn this point, what we're doing is\nwe're using an electricity to store and\n\n280\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.720\nread that information.\n\n281\n00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.460\nAnd that is essentially what\na solid state drive is.\n\n282\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.330\nThey call them SSDs, right?\n\n283\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.980\nSolid state drives uses technically\nwhat is called nanflash memory.\n\n284\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.840\nBut just think of it as\na non volatile memory.\n\n285\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.560\nAnd they are memory chips that are in\nthe device itself using electronic\n\n286\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.420\ncurrent if you will to store and\nread that information.\n\n287\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.388\nIn fact I've got kind of an example here.\n\n288\n00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:07.296\nOne of these OCZ solid state drives, and\nthe OCZ solid state drives, and the OCZ\n\n289\n00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:12.150\nis just a brand guys, don't think of that\nas of actual technology if you will.\n\n290\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.229\nThat's the manufacturer,\nCorsair, Kingston,\n\n291\n00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:15.930\na lot of different companies make these.\n\n292\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.010\nIntel makes solid state drives.\n\n293\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.533\nBut notice that it's using what\nit looks like memory chips and\n\n294\n00:15:20.533 --> 00:15:22.038\nthat's essentially what they are,\n\n295\n00:15:22.038 --> 00:15:25.600\nthose are those non volatile chips that we\ntalked about in our memory section, right?\n\n296\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.930\nThat are perfect for\n\n297\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.840\nstoring information because of the fact\nthat we can remove the power, and\n\n298\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.890\nwhen we remove the power we can still\nget access to the data at a later time.\n\n299\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.310\nUnlike volatile memory, or\nsystem memory if you will,\n\n300\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.410\nagain, that requires the presence\nof an electrical current.\n\n301\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.428\nAll right, now these\nare non-mechanical drives, right?\n\n302\n00:15:43.428 --> 00:15:44.900\nYou can see the big difference here, and\n\n303\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.200\nlet me see if I go back to\nthe magnetic drive, right?\n\n304\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.174\nThe magnetic drive, we have multiple\nplatters, they're gonna be spinning,\n\n305\n00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:54.091\nthey've got an actuator arm\nthat reads the information.\n\n306\n00:15:54.091 --> 00:15:57.356\nYou have an actuator motor that is\nresponsible with a bearing in it for\n\n307\n00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.920\nmoving that like the record player\nneedle back and forth across the drive.\n\n308\n00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.169\nBut, if you consider or\n\n309\n00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:07.080\ncompare that with this drive notice\nthat all we have are these memory chips.\n\n310\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.300\nNow, in the memory episode that we did,\n\n311\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.560\none of the things I told you that\ndifferentiates one of the main\n\n312\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.340\ncontributors to why these\nare slow to take hold.\n\n313\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.360\nI say slow to take hold and that might\nbe true ten years ago but no so anymore.\n\n314\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.580\nIs the fact that non-volatile\nmemory is very expensive.\n\n315\n00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.970\nSo you'll see that the price\npoint on these is still up there.\n\n316\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.300\nIt's come down considerably.\n\n317\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.280\nWhen it first came out, it was about\n$2 a gig which is very expensive.\n\n318\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.725\nIf you figure that you had,\nI don't know, a 100 gig drive,\n\n319\n00:16:40.725 --> 00:16:45.405\nyou're talking $200 for the drive versus\nsomething that, a mechanical drive,\n\n320\n00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:49.500\nthat if you spent $200, you would\nhave the biggest drive on the block,\n\n321\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.335\nagain, versus I don't know,\n$0.50 to $0.80 cents a gig.\n\n322\n00:16:53.335 --> 00:16:56.490\nToday they're actually come\ndown quite a bit in price.\n\n323\n00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.858\nThey're actually finding ways to make\nthem more efficient if you will and\n\n324\n00:16:59.858 --> 00:17:01.447\nagain the price points come down.\n\n325\n00:17:01.447 --> 00:17:06.428\nBut they're still very expensive\ncompared to the mechanical drive.\n\n326\n00:17:06.428 --> 00:17:10.421\nHowever, one of the benefits they have is,\nagain going back to the fact that they're\n\n327\n00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:14.081\nnon mechanical, is I don't have to wait\nfor all these components to start up,\n\n328\n00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:17.853\nto initiate, to seek, if you will, and\nthen have that arm find on the mechanical\n\n329\n00:17:17.853 --> 00:17:20.780\ndrive, right,\nfind the location of where your data it.\n\n330\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.840\nAll we do is we put an electrical charge.\n\n331\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.640\nAnd I don't really know how\nfast electricity moves,\n\n332\n00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.929\nbecause we're not engineers here,\nand this isn't a physics class\n\n333\n00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:27.936\n&gt;&gt; It moves faster than me.\n\n334\n00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:31.113\n&gt;&gt; Right, it definitely moves faster than\nI do, is the fact that we just have to\n\n335\n00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:33.460\nwait for the electrical\ncurrent to be present, right?\n\n336\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.550\nSo we get very,\nvery fast access times, right?\n\n337\n00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.940\nWe get very, very fast read times.\n\n338\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.130\nAnd there are a couple of\ndifferent drives out there.\n\n339\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.960\nAnd I don't think they\ncall this out on the exam,\n\n340\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.400\nbut I just kind of want to\nbriefly mention it here.\n\n341\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.660\nThey have what are known as single\nlevel cell solid state drives.\n\n342\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.090\nYou might hear them called SLC SSDs.\n\n343\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.960\nThey also have what are known\nas mult-level cell drives.\n\n344\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.810\nAnd basically it's about how much\ninformation can be stored on the data and\n\n345\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.780\nalso expense and speed.\n\n346\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.660\nA single level cell, again, cuz it single\nlevel can only store smaller capacities.\n\n347\n00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.670\nBut the drive controller, if you will,\njust we talked about a memory controller\n\n348\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.380\nin our memory episodes that actually\ncontrols access to the memory, right?\n\n349\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.830\nYou have this component within all\nthe drives that are called a drive\n\n350\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.395\ncontroller and it's what allows\nyou to access the information.\n\n351\n00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:28.375\nWell in the single level cell drives,\n\n352\n00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:32.745\nthe drive controllers can access the\ninformation a lot faster cuz they don't\n\n353\n00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:35.895\nhave to do a lot of guesswork because of\nthe fact that it's just a single level.\n\n354\n00:18:35.895 --> 00:18:39.540\nMulti-level cells allow you\nto store more information so\n\n355\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.170\nthe capacities are greater\nat a smaller price point.\n\n356\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:48.260\nHowever, due to the multiple levels\nthat you can store the information,\n\n357\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.650\nit can be prone to things like errors and\nthe speeds are a little bit smaller.\n\n358\n00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.230\nHowever bigger capacity, smaller price\npoint makes them one of the most common\n\n359\n00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.260\nones, common SSD types that we have.\n\n360\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.980\nNow, you did mention one other thing\nthat I do want to talk about and\n\n361\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.890\nthat is flash drives.\n\n362\n00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.590\nAnd flash drives really are using\nthe same concept, all right.\n\n363\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.510\nIn fact, I gotta picture of one.\n\n364\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.050\nYou probably seen these a lot.\n\n365\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:12.860\nWhat do you call them?\n\n366\n00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.790\nThumb drives, right?\n\n367\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.780\nUSB thumb drives,\nflash drives if you will.\n\n368\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.520\nFlash drives are also using\nNAND flash memory, as well.\n\n369\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.330\nJust like I showed you, the solid state\ndrive here, what you would see if you,\n\n370\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.560\nI would almost guarantee it.\n\n371\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.669\nIf you pull the shell\nof of this flash drive,\n\n372\n00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:30.920\nthen what you're gonna see is\nprobably just a single chip, right?\n\n373\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.350\nA single one of those\nnon-volatile memory chips,\n\n374\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.260\nthat when you plug in It allows\nyou the electrical storage.\n\n375\n00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.970\nSo that essentially is\nwhat the flash drive is.\n\n376\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.535\nIt's a lot like the solid-state drive but\nit's using a different, well I don't know\n\n377\n00:19:45.535 --> 00:19:49.728\nsolid-state drives can use USB connections\nas well but for the most part.\n\n378\n00:19:49.728 --> 00:19:52.740\nYour internal SSDs are using your typical\n\n379\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.750\nhard drive protocols that we\ntalk about in our PC connection.\n\n380\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.740\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n381\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.000\nAnd I suppose those are pricier?\n\n382\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.950\n&gt;&gt; The flash drives,\nthey've come down in price.\n\n383\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.280\nWhen they first came out,\nthey're so common now today, again.\n\n384\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.200\nAnd that they've come down.\n\n385\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.420\nThey're very cheap.\n\n386\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.620\nWhat really gets price point on that one,\nZach,\n\n387\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.760\nis the fact that the bigger the capacity-\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n388\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.489\n&gt;&gt; The more chips they have to put on\n\n389\n00:20:16.489 --> 00:20:19.502\nthere and again more chips,\nmore manufacturer cost and\n\n390\n00:20:19.502 --> 00:20:24.070\nthat translates to consumers out there,\nright, there paying more money for them.\n\n391\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.020\nSo, you can see like a 128\ngig thumb drives today.\n\n392\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.960\nAnd those still have\na pretty good price point.\n\n393\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.670\nYou can see some that, believe,\n\n394\n00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.590\nare up to 256 gigs on a little stick\nlike that but very, very expensive.\n\n395\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.580\nLike the one I had up there,\nthat was a four gig drive.\n\n396\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.430\nThose today are almost a dime a dozen.\n\n397\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now, when they first came out,\n\n398\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.750\nthey were very expensive.\n\n399\n00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.270\nYou get a four gig drive and you're\ntalking about a lot of money for those.\n\n400\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.970\nBut again just like anything as time\nprogresses, as the technology gets better,\n\n401\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.500\nand as things capacities that we\nhad today becomes yesterday's news.\n\n402\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.550\nThose smaller capacities\nactually cost less money.\n\n403\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.780\nAll right so one of the next\nthings I want to talk about and\n\n404\n00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.160\nprobably [LAUGH] I can see Zach saying we\nmight have to go into a part three here.\n\n405\n00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.940\nOne of the last things I want to\ntalk about in this episode here\n\n406\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.210\nare compact flash.\n\n407\n00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:19.390\nAnd compact flash is using the same\nconcept of electrical storage medium.\n\n408\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.370\nNow, this is also just like the flash\ndrive, a little thumb drive.\n\n409\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.940\nThis is removable media, right, so\nit's a removable storage medium and\n\n410\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.010\nthere are a few different formats.\n\n411\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.670\nAnd I don't know how specific they\nare gonna get on the exam cuz you\n\n412\n00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.050\njust never really know what\nthe questions are that you're gonna get.\n\n413\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.540\nThere's large banks, large pools of\nquestions that CompTIA gives you, but\n\n414\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.590\nlets go ahead and let's talk about some\nof the nuts and bolts compact flash and\n\n415\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.920\ngive you some of the specifications.\n\n416\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.770\nI know, guys, standards don't,\nthey're not fun.\n\n417\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:53.770\nBut if you can remember them for\nthe exam, you can do great.\n\n418\n00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.770\nAnd then, once you pass your exam,\nyou can forget the standards, and\n\n419\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.040\nthen just Google them when you need to.\n\n420\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.110\nI use a search engine.\n\n421\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.890\nBut you won't be able to Google\ninside of the exam booth, and\n\n422\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.260\nthat's why I want to make\nsure that you're prepared.\n\n423\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.600\nI've got an example of some of these\ndifferent flash drive types, or\n\n424\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.680\ncompact flash.\n\n425\n00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.670\nAnd you've probably seen them.\n\n426\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.910\nAnd if any of you guys,\nwhich I know many of you do.\n\n427\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.720\nI say if any of you guys and\ngals out there have them, I know you do.\n\n428\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.080\nI'm sure have probably\nused these a lot more,\n\n429\n00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.000\nespecially if you have\nthings like mobile devices.\n\n430\n00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Micro SD.\n\n431\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.290\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it and those are some of\nthe first ones that they call out, too.\n\n432\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.410\nAnd to one that Zach mentioned is exactly\nup here on the right hand side of\n\n433\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.600\nyour screen.\n\n434\n00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.430\nAnd you can see I went ahead and\nput the three form factors.\n\n435\n00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.650\nThese are actually an adapter that\nallows you the intercompatibility.\n\n436\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.960\nSo that if I have one of the smallest\nones I could put that in a bigger sleeve,\n\n437\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.280\nif you will, and\nthen finally put that in a bigger sleeve.\n\n438\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.620\nAnd that's something\nknown as secure digital.\n\n439\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.750\nSecure digital is the SD\ncard that you mentioned.\n\n440\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.480\nAnd you can see it comes in three formats.\n\n441\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.000\nAnd the formats that you\nsee are these up here.\n\n442\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.450\nYou have what's known as\na full size SD card and\n\n443\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.040\nthat's exactly what it sounds like,\nit's a big SD card.\n\n444\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.090\nThen you have what's known as\nthe microS mini SD card and\n\n445\n00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.580\nyou also have the micro SD card.\n\n446\n00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.280\nAnd those are called form factors.\n\n447\n00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.350\nRemember what a form factor is in this\ncase, it is the size of the component.\n\n448\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:18.020\nUnlike a motherboard that also describes\nthe things like characteristics.\n\n449\n00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.930\nWhen we talk about form factor\nin this context what we're\n\n450\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.220\ntalking about really is the size.\n\n451\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.190\nAnd this is three different\nform factors of secure digital.\n\n452\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.730\nSecure digital, by itself an SD card.\n\n453\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.840\nThat's a full size, right?\n\n454\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.430\nAnd then you have the miniSD and\nthen you have the microSD.\n\n455\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.614\nNow I do want you to understand that\nyou have a few different capacities and\n\n456\n00:23:36.614 --> 00:23:41.340\nthat's also good to know, because you\nmight see mini, I'll give you an example,\n\n457\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.918\nyou might see a microSDHC.\n\n458\n00:23:42.918 --> 00:23:44.581\nBoy that's a bunch of alphabet soup,\nall right.\n\n459\n00:23:44.581 --> 00:23:45.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me help you out.\n\n460\n00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.890\nMicro secure digital, high capacity.\n\n461\n00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.212\nSo you have three capacities, you have\nwhat's known as standard capacity,\n\n462\n00:23:52.212 --> 00:23:54.165\nwhich is kind of becoming\na thing of the past.\n\n463\n00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:57.453\nThey're still out there,\nthey're interchangeable, but\n\n464\n00:23:57.453 --> 00:24:00.814\nvery small capacities,\nwe're talking megabytes, right.\n\n465\n00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:04.414\nBut then you have high capacity and\nyou also have extended capacity.\n\n466\n00:24:04.414 --> 00:24:08.022\nSome of the extended capacities\nare up to 128 gigs and\n\n467\n00:24:08.022 --> 00:24:11.930\nI believe beyond 256 gigs\njust on a little miro card.\n\n468\n00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.080\n&gt;&gt; Gee.\n&gt;&gt; So absolutely amazing that you can get\n\n469\n00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.810\nall that information on something\nthat really is that big.\n\n470\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.880\nSo definitely keep that in\nmind that the secure digital.\n\n471\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.270\nSome of the other ones that they have,\nthey have what's known as the XD card.\n\n472\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.820\nThe XD card is an older standard,\nit was used in digital cameras.\n\n473\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.140\nIt's really limited usage,\n\n474\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.842\nit didn't have a lot of different\nmanufacturers that we're using it.\n\n475\n00:24:35.842 --> 00:24:38.480\nBut then, secure digital,\nthe SD cards have\n\n476\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.690\npretty much made these go by the wayside\nand that's what's more common today.\n\n477\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.150\nYou can see capacities.\n\n478\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.333\n[LAUGH] Some of you guys\nmight laugh at this one.\n\n479\n00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:52.170\nBut down to 16 megs all the way\nup to right around two gigs.\n\n480\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.515\nAnd with secure digital,\nthe high capacities that they have, and\n\n481\n00:24:55.515 --> 00:24:58.214\nthen, the extended capacities\nthat they have, XD.\n\n482\n00:24:58.214 --> 00:25:02.859\nThe fact of the matter is secure\ndigitals pretty much run out on how, or\n\n483\n00:25:02.859 --> 00:25:07.500\none, how we store information\non mobile devices, as well.\n\n484\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:13.000\nThe other one that they have\nis what is known as the EMMC.\n\n485\n00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.870\nThat is the embedded multimedia card.\n\n486\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.290\nAnd these were again, typically,\n\n487\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.190\nthey had an embedded circuit\nboard if you will, again.\n\n488\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.850\nAnd had its non volatile memory,\n\n489\n00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.930\njust like all the other cards are used\nin mobile phones and tablets.\n\n490\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:33.907\nOne of the good things about the EMMC\ncard, it was the fact that it had speeds\n\n491\n00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:37.706\nthat were comparable to what\nour solid state drives are.\n\n492\n00:25:37.706 --> 00:25:40.680\nWhich is one of the things that\nkinda made it very convenient.\n\n493\n00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.780\nHowever, the majority of\nthese cards today that you\n\n494\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.120\nfind outside of an XAML environment\nare really gonna be the SD card.\n\n495\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.900\nSo those are a few different\ntypes of your cards.\n\n496\n00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.480\nI think, Zack,\n\n497\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.180\nthe one last thing I wanna take of is\nsomething known as the tape drive.\n\n498\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.125\nAnd,\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n499\n00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:02.222\n&gt;&gt; This is exactly you had a great\nquestion before even started the show,\n\n500\n00:26:02.222 --> 00:26:04.519\nare you kidding me really tape drives?\n\n501\n00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:06.765\nWe're going back to the days\nof the cassette tape-\n\n502\n00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:08.307\n&gt;&gt; Everything old is new again.\n\n503\n00:26:08.307 --> 00:26:11.621\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it seems like\ntechnology cycle around on it.\n\n504\n00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:14.609\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And to answer your question, yes,\n\n505\n00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:16.560\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n506\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.520\nIt's the real magnetic tape.\n\n507\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.690\nYou might be asking yourself,\nwell what is this, 1980?\n\n508\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.485\nAll right.\n\n509\n00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:26.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even before that, the old A track,\n\n510\n00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.120\nin the late 70s and stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.830\n&gt;&gt; And really the concept is the same.\n\n512\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.430\nIt's another form of magnetic media and\nwe still use it today.\n\n513\n00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.050\nHowever, one of the things\nthat tape drives are very,\n\n514\n00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.830\nvery good at is holding\nlarge amounts of data.\n\n515\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.700\nI mean, large amounts of data.\n\n516\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.370\nSony's got some that are in the works.\n\n517\n00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.380\nIt's either Sony or IBM.\n\n518\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.726\nAnd I can't think of the two giants,\nwhich of the giants it is,\n\n519\n00:26:50.726 --> 00:26:53.351\nthat can put up to a 185 terabytes.\n\n520\n00:26:53.351 --> 00:26:53.926\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n521\n00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:55.508\n&gt;&gt; On a single tape.\n\n522\n00:26:55.508 --> 00:26:59.530\nSo, they're perfect for archival, right?\n\n523\n00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.040\nWait, we know it as back ups.\n\n524\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.360\nIf you ever hear of data archival,\ndon't let that confuse you.\n\n525\n00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.951\nWe're going to talk more about back ups\nwhen we get, for instance, into 902.\n\n526\n00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:12.290\nThe 902 episodes but are crucial set of\ninformation that we can't afford to lose.\n\n527\n00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.150\nWe could put it on tapes, right?\n\n528\n00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.260\nNow, understand that\nthe information is read sequential,\n\n529\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.980\nmuch like the old tape cassettes would be.\n\n530\n00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.909\nIf you remember the tape cassettes,\nyou would have to fast forward to the next\n\n531\n00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:26.538\ntrack, you couldn't just-\n&gt;&gt; I still have tons of them.\n\n532\n00:27:26.538 --> 00:27:27.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n533\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.420\nYour age and yourself,\n\n534\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.377\nsorry to do that to you,\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n535\n00:27:29.377 --> 00:27:30.930\n&gt;&gt; On camera there.\n\n536\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.720\nAnd that's right, the red sequential and\n\n537\n00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.460\nthat's important to understand is that\nyou know the data is red sequential.\n\n538\n00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.450\nAgain its a magnetic interface, they are\nremovable media used for backups today.\n\n539\n00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.030\nAnd you can see capacities anywhere,\n\n540\n00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:49.370\nit commonly anywhere from 100 gigs all the\nway up to 12.8 terabytes of information.\n\n541\n00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.980\nAnd what I want you to know for the exam\nis not some of the formats like they have.\n\n542\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.670\nThe most common format, if you wanna go\nout and look is the Ultrium 8 standard and\n\n543\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.980\nit's called the LTO tape.\n\n544\n00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.620\nThat's a Linear Tape Open Standard.\n\n545\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.410\nAnd just for the most part, know that tape\ndrives are there, know that we use them.\n\n546\n00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.740\nThey're very high speed.\n\n547\n00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:13.288\nThey have the speed that those\nspinning wheels can spin just as fast.\n\n548\n00:28:13.288 --> 00:28:18.640\nIf not, in some cases faster than\nthe internal magnetic drives that we have.\n\n549\n00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.870\nThe LTO standard, I think,\ndoes about 160 megabytes sequential reads.\n\n550\n00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.310\nAnd that's what the very first serial\nATA standard support have more.\n\n551\n00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.860\nThe original serial ATA\nstandard that came out\n\n552\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.250\nonly supported 150 megabyte\ntransfer speeds so very, very fast.\n\n553\n00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.000\nAgain, they're expensive.\n\n554\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.329\nBut they're typically used inside of\nenterprises that need to archive their\n\n555\n00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:42.730\ninformation and\nthey can't afford to lose it.\n\n556\n00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.290\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nWes because magnetite degrades over time.\n\n557\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.810\nDo they take that information then and\nthen store that somewhere else?\n\n558\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.180\n&gt;&gt; That is a great question, yes they do.\n\n559\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.320\nBecause it is no different than some\nof the issues you would have back\n\n560\n00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.580\nwhen we had tape cassettes were so common.\n\n561\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.376\nI'm sure you probably did this,\nI know I did this.\n\n562\n00:29:00.376 --> 00:29:02.070\n&gt;&gt; No,\n&gt;&gt; Especially here in Florida,\n\n563\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:06.700\nyou leave it on the dashboard, you come\nback after a good afternoon of very,\n\n564\n00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.510\nvery hot weather and the tape is warped.\n\n565\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:13.250\nSo they definitely have to seal\nthese in climate controlled systems.\n\n566\n00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.788\nYou have entire robotic machinery too.\n\n567\n00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:21.972\nIf you've ever seen some of your SCi-Fi\nmovies where you have an arm that comes,\n\n568\n00:29:21.972 --> 00:29:27.020\npulls a tape, pulls it down, those are,\nthat's what that machine is doing.\n\n569\n00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.606\nThat machine is finding tape\ndata then it's moving it down.\n\n570\n00:29:29.606 --> 00:29:32.940\nThat is very, very expensive,\nbut you might be that robot.\n\n571\n00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.465\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:29:33.465 --> 00:29:35.370\n&gt;&gt; And it might be part of your job as\n\n573\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.330\na backup operator.\n\n574\n00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.490\nBut it's a great question.\n\n575\n00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.358\nAnd you do have to store these in\na climate-controlled and secure system,\n\n576\n00:29:42.358 --> 00:29:43.757\nor secure location.\n\n577\n00:29:43.757 --> 00:29:46.430\nTo make sure that you don't\nlose the information.\n\n578\n00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:50.940\nBecause like any other magnetic media you\ndo run the risk of what's known as dot, or\n\n579\n00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.590\nbit rod,\n\n580\n00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.940\nor data rod in the fact that the media\ncan start to lose its magnetic charge.\n\n581\n00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.285\nAnd you certainly can't keep\nthem next to like magnets,\n\n582\n00:29:58.285 --> 00:29:59.950\nbecause it can scramble the information.\n\n583\n00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.020\nAnd so\n\n584\n00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:07.430\nthose are some of the considerations that\nwe have to just know about and consider.\n\n585\n00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.850\n&gt;&gt; Wes, awesome job, thank you very much.\n\n586\n00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:14.736\nAnd this is part two of installing\nconfigure storage devices, A+901,\n\n587\n00:30:14.736 --> 00:30:17.515\nand you wanna catch part one and\nthere'll be a part three.\n\n588\n00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.040\n[LAUGH] And thank you for\n\n589\n00:30:19.040 -->

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:16.754\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.727\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with A+ 901, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:23.121\nwe're talking about storage devices.\n\n9\n00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:28.350\nThis is actually part three of installing\nconfigured storage devices and\n\n10\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.910\nWes Bryan is gonna help us out\nagain like he always does.\n\n11\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.524\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're working on a little\nmini series here before you know it.\n\n12\n00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:35.294\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We'll be challenging Stephen King for\n\n13\n00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:37.330\nthe amount of papers that\nhe's fit in the book.\n\n14\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.941\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, well,\n\n15\n00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:43.945\nwe have just a couple really things that\nwe wanna tie up here in this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:47.730\nAnd in the past episodes we've been\ntalking about all different types of\n\n17\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.470\nstorage media that we can\nsee inside of our systems.\n\n18\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.580\nFor instance, we've been talking\nabout optical drives, right.\n\n19\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.960\nOptical laser writes to your, or\nburns if you will, the media and it either\n\n20\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.740\nis lands or pits, raised or lowered areas\nif you will, I think I did that backwards.\n\n21\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.700\nHow about raised or\nlower areas there [LAUGH] and\n\n22\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.890\nthat's how it reads the information.\n\n23\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.330\nMagnetic media using electromagnetic\ncharge to either read or\n\n24\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.090\nwrite the information if\nyou will to the disk.\n\n25\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.290\nAnd then we also talked\nabout electronic storage.\n\n26\n00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.830\nNow one of the things that I didn't\nmention and I kinda wanna double back to,\n\n27\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.380\nis that we do have a type that kind of\nblends two different storage medium types.\n\n28\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.680\nAnd it really combines magnetic\nstorage with your electronic storage.\n\n29\n00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.230\nAnd that's something known as a hybrid,\nall right.\n\n30\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.330\nAnd when we talk about a hybrid,\n\n31\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.700\nwe're not talking about using\nvegetable oil to power your car.\n\n32\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.240\nThat's not really what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n33\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.190\nWe're using, I guess you could say\nelectrical it's kinda like that right,\n\n34\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.260\nwell let's go ahead and\nfollow that train of thought.\n\n35\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.334\nRight, if you have a hybrid car\nyou're using some kind of combustible\n\n36\n00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:48.020\nfuel, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.690\nBut at the same time, you could plug\nit in and use electricity, right.\n\n38\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.140\nYou get best of both, if you will.\n\n39\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.910\nNow, so what does a hybrid mean\nwhen we talk about storage mediums?\n\n40\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.250\nWell, with storage mediums, what we're\ntalking about is taking magnetic media and\n\n41\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.060\nputting some of those electronic chips\ninto the same case, if you will.\n\n42\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.270\nNow, what does this do for us, right?\n\n43\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.830\nWell, what this does is this says that\ninformation that's gonna be stored and\n\n44\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.660\nwe're not currently using, right?\n\n45\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.060\nWe don't need high speed access\nnecessarily to that information, so\n\n46\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.790\nwe can put it on slower\ntraditional mechanical media.\n\n47\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.900\nAnd again, remember when I say that\nwe're not talking two separate devices,\n\n48\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.630\nall built into the same hard drive,\nitself.\n\n49\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.770\nBut however,\nwe have frequently used data, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.230\nWe have information that we gonna get\naccess to on a regular basis we're gonna\n\n51\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.970\nuse more frequently than\nthe infrequent data, right?\n\n52\n00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.480\nSo, we want faster access\nto that information.\n\n53\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.495\nSo, what they come up with\nis a combination of the two.\n\n54\n00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:43.605\nAnd pretty much for the purpose of\ngiving you some kind of performance\n\n55\n00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:46.555\nof a solid state drive and\nstill kind of keeping the cost down.\n\n56\n00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:48.125\nAnd that's what a hybrid does.\n\n57\n00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:52.655\nReally, a hybrid is mechanical,\nmoving platters, inside of that drive, and\n\n58\n00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.325\nsome of those NAND flash memory chips\nthat are sitting on a circuit board.\n\n59\n00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:57.915\nAnd it says,\nall of the frequently used information\n\n60\n00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:00.970\nis gonna go into the NAND flash memory,\nso that we can get to it quicker.\n\n61\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.344\nThe information that's not used or\nis used a little bit less infrequently, if\n\n62\n00:03:05.344 --> 00:03:10.130\nyou will, or less frequently excuse me, is\ngonna be stored on the mechanical drive.\n\n63\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.792\nSo that's one that I kind of\nwanted to double back on.\n\n64\n00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.510\nWe wanna make sure that you\nhave everything here and\n\n65\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.990\nI was looking at my list.\n\n66\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.670\nSo ,definitely know that it's\na blending between of the two.\n\n67\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.970\n&gt;&gt; So now is the time to\njump into the RAID types?\n\n68\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.100\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\nyou'll commonly hear this called RAID.\n\n69\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.200\nAnd when talk about RAID is we are not\ntalking really about pest control here,\n\n70\n00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.830\nbut what we're talking about is\nsomething known is an acronym, right?\n\n71\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.535\nAnd it's an acronym that's been around for\na while and\n\n72\n00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.655\nyou will here a couple of different terms.\n\n73\n00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:38.120\nYou'll here redundant array\nof independent disks.\n\n74\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.660\nMore often, that's the common\nterm that it's been called.\n\n75\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.762\nIt used to be called redundant\narray of inexpensive disks.\n\n76\n00:03:44.762 --> 00:03:49.443\nAnd what I mean by that is when\nRAID technologies first started\n\n77\n00:03:49.443 --> 00:03:53.584\nto come into play, and\nwe could see some of the earliest\n\n78\n00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:58.192\nkind of technologies if you will\nstarting to go toward RAID.\n\n79\n00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:01.420\nWhat we had is things\nlike your DEC equipments,\n\n80\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.780\nDEC corporation excuse me,\nDigital Equipment Corporation and\n\n81\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.639\ncompanies like IBM that would have very,\nvery expensive hard drives.\n\n82\n00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.362\nAnd they're big mainframes,\nbig systems right, very expensive.\n\n83\n00:04:14.362 --> 00:04:19.579\nSo a lot of different engineers, it's not\nany one person, many different companies,\n\n84\n00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.684\nactually made different forms of\nwhat would later be called RAID.\n\n85\n00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:27.441\nBecause they called them inexpensive,\nbecause it was inexpensive compared\n\n86\n00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:31.150\nto the expense of the massive hard drives\nthat these big systems would have.\n\n87\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.450\nSo in the earlier days, they called it\nthe redundant array of inexpensive disks.\n\n88\n00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.380\nHowever, later on, they decided\nto change the acronym around and\n\n89\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.070\ncall it redundant array\nof independent disks.\n\n90\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.220\nNow, I don't want you to\nworry about the semantics.\n\n91\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.568\nWe've talked about and joked [LAUGH]\nZach you and I have off camera tomato,\n\n92\n00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:49.223\ntomato here.\n\n93\n00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:50.056\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although,\n\n94\n00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.800\nI haven't heard anybody call it tomato.\n\n95\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.350\nBut that's just a little bit of semantics.\n\n96\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.170\nHowever, what does that mean?\n\n97\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.110\nWell, if I have one hard drive,\nlet's say that I take one hard drive and\n\n98\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.458\nwe have a drive controller right?\n\n99\n00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:06.970\nThe drive controller's the littlest\ncircuitry on the drive itself that allows\n\n100\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.985\nus access to the information or access to\nthe storage medium to write information,\n\n101\n00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.615\nto store information.\n\n102\n00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:19.255\nNow, I want you to think about, if I have\none of those drives, and more specifically\n\n103\n00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:22.955\nthink about the drive controller\nthat's embedded into that hard drive.\n\n104\n00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.715\nIt's gonna do the work of one drive.\n\n105\n00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:27.769\nBut what happens if I think or\nif I decide,\n\n106\n00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:30.725\nmaybe I want a little\nbit better performance?\n\n107\n00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:35.760\nWouldn't it is nice to take two of those\nhard drives and put them together.\n\n108\n00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.379\nAnd now what we have\nis a multi task right?\n\n109\n00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.832\nWe have two drives working in tandem,\n\n110\n00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:44.978\ntwo drive controllers giving us access\nto two separate drives at the same time.\n\n111\n00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:48.830\nAnd that's essentially what\nthey call a RAID array.\n\n112\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.400\nNow a RAID array is just\na aggregation of multiple disks.\n\n113\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.257\nAnd you do it for\na couple of different reasons.\n\n114\n00:05:54.257 --> 00:05:56.544\nThe name implies, redundancy.\n\n115\n00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:58.100\nWell, what's redundancy?\n\n116\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.050\nRedundancy is having\nmore of any one system.\n\n117\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.062\nI don't care if it's a hard drive.\n\n118\n00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:06.094\nI don't care if it's a telephone system,\nif you get more than one phone, right,\n\n119\n00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:09.380\njust in case one phone dies,\nyou have a redundant system, right-\n\n120\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.906\n&gt;&gt; Back up of the back up of the back up.\n\n121\n00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:13.140\n&gt;&gt; That's right, back up and\nthe back up and the back ups, right?\n\n122\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.220\nSo we have more than one system.\n\n123\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.060\nSo it's about redundancy.\n\n124\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.450\nAll right now, what does redundancy mean?\n\n125\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.580\nRedundancy or why do we implement\nredundancy, more than one.\n\n126\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.380\nWell, we implement redundancy\nto achieve something known as\n\n127\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.700\nfault tolerance, all right?\n\n128\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.600\nWhat's fault tolerance?\n\n129\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.870\nFault tolerance is being able to\nwithstand a foreseeable failure.\n\n130\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.845\nIt's not a matter of if something fails,\n\n131\n00:06:31.845 --> 00:06:33.770\nit's a matter of when something fails,\nright?\n\n132\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.563\nMechanical drives fail, all right.\n\n133\n00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:37.977\nSo that's one of the big\nthings about RAID,\n\n134\n00:06:37.977 --> 00:06:40.203\nredundant array of independent disks.\n\n135\n00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:44.410\nNow, as time progressed, we have\nindustry wide standards and definitions,\n\n136\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.893\nor if you will,\nRAID types as they call it, and\n\n137\n00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:49.900\nmore specifically what\nthey call it on the exam.\n\n138\n00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.930\nAnd there's different RAID types.\n\n139\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.770\nAnd each one of them have their pros and\ncons, and\n\n140\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.430\neach one of them have their utilization\ninside of our computing industry today.\n\n141\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.430\nAnd it really means that\nyou have to pick and\n\n142\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.440\nchoose which one you want based on\nthe goals that you have to achieve.\n\n143\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.002\nLet me go in here a little bit\nmore in to depth what I mean here.\n\n144\n00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:09.522\nI've got a couple of\ndifferent RAID types and\n\n145\n00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:11.530\nthere are all different types\nof RAID types out there guys.\n\n146\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.057\nThe most common standard and I don't\neven want to say common standards, but\n\n147\n00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:21.000\nthe RAID types that we had for a long\ntime were zero through six, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.637\nThe ones that you see 0 through 5 here,\n0, 1 and 5, these are the most common,\n\n149\n00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:29.243\nindustry wide standards that have\nbeen adopted for a long time.\n\n150\n00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:35.457\nThings like 2, 3 and 4, these weren't\nused as common as 0, 1 and 5.\n\n151\n00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:38.861\nAnd then when we have what\nare called nested RAIDs, right,\n\n152\n00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:42.550\nwhere we have things like RAID 10,\nRAID 50 and RAID 100.\n\n153\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.101\nThank goodness you only have to worry\nabout RAID 10 for this exam, and\n\n154\n00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:47.588\nwe'll get into what we mean.\n\n155\n00:07:47.588 --> 00:07:51.500\nOkay, so when I say a RAID type,\nI have these to choose from and\n\n156\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.213\nI have to understand why I would\nchoose one over the other.\n\n157\n00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:58.771\nWhen it comes to implementing a RAID for\nthe specific system that I'm supporting.\n\n158\n00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:01.926\n&gt;&gt; Now, before you do that,\nwhere does the RAID live?\n\n159\n00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:05.740\nDoes it live inside our\nsystems,our laptops, our PC's?\n\n160\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.790\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n161\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.690\nSo, in our expansion card episode,\n\n162\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.460\nwe've talked about things like\nintegrated functionality and\n\n163\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.660\nexpandable functionality and you can see\nthese in two different locations, right?\n\n164\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.850\nWe can see these either integrated\ninto the logic of the motherboard,\n\n165\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.400\nthat chipset that we said\nunderstands video, audio,\n\n166\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.150\nif you will,\ncan move your data across the motherboard.\n\n167\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.385\nIt's called a RAID controller.\n\n168\n00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:27.930\nRight.\n\n169\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.870\nJust like we have a drive controller.\n\n170\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.620\nWell, if you take two\ndrive controllers and\n\n171\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.630\nyou put them in a RAID array,\nwe have a RAID controller\n\n172\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.100\nthat is like the commander in chief\nof the synchronized swimmers.\n\n173\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.940\nIt controls the two drive\ncontrollers if you will.\n\n174\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.635\nWell, that's redundant for a redundant\narray of independent disks, right?\n\n175\n00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:44.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n176\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.880\nyou can find it integrated in\nthe functionality in the mother board.\n\n177\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.020\nYou can also find dedicated expansion\ncards that you put into an expansion slot\n\n178\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.550\non the motherboard and\nthat card has the dedicated functionality.\n\n179\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.359\nAnd I'm glad you asked that Zach too,\nbecause let's take a second here and\n\n180\n00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:00.962\njust kinda recap what we said back\nin the expansion episode, right.\n\n181\n00:09:00.962 --> 00:09:04.426\nWe said that integrated functionality,\nit gives you the ability to have\n\n182\n00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:07.690\nthe functionality and\nnot have to pay extra money for it, right.\n\n183\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.230\nBut keep in mind that anything that's\nintegrated is also kinda working in\n\n184\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.510\ncompetition with all the other things\nthat the motherboard has to do, so\n\n185\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.010\nyou've kind of got this\ncontention going on.\n\n186\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.535\nIf you get it integrated into\nthe functionality of the motherboard and\n\n187\n00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:24.330\nyou're using integrated video,\nwell you also got video going on there.\n\n188\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.400\nSo if I have a dedicated card and\nI put the card in the expansion slot,\n\n189\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.860\nwe have a device, it's sole purpose is\nto take care of the RAID configuration\n\n190\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.870\nthat we have, and more so, to coordinate\nthe hard drives in a Raid array.\n\n191\n00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.220\n&gt;&gt; And the more devices we put in,\n\n192\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.960\nthe more drives we put in, etc,\netc, that can cause latency, right?\n\n193\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.530\n&gt;&gt; Well it can.\n\n194\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.910\nAnd this is where it comes down to\nknowing which RAID type you choose for\n\n195\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.730\nwhatever the goal is.\n\n196\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, sure.\n\n197\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.260\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and let's take a look\nat some of the RAID types that we have.\n\n198\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.950\nLike I said, these that we have here,\nwe have 0, 1, 5, and 10.\n\n199\n00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.450\nLet's start with RAID 0, all right?\n\n200\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.364\nSo what is RAID 0?\n\n201\n00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:04.610\nI want you to imagine\nthese cylinders here.\n\n202\n00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.290\nEach of these as being hard drives.\n\n203\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.460\nWe've got one hard drive on one side,\nright?\n\n204\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.790\nWe've got another hard drive\non the other side, right?\n\n205\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.890\nSo two drives here and\nwe're gonna put them together and\n\n206\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.980\nthey're gonna work together for\nsome kind of goal that we want to achieve.\n\n207\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.220\nNow, I also want you to pay\nattention to that name.\n\n208\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.710\nRaid 0, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.590\nSo Raid 0, gives you 0 redundancy.\n\n210\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.880\nThat's one of the things that\nyou can remember on the exam.\n\n211\n00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.530\nThis was isn't done for the fact\nthat I need full tolerance, right?\n\n212\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.960\nThis is done for sheer performance.\n\n213\n00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.020\nYou want speed, right?\n\n214\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:41.620\nAnd what this is called is, this RAID\n0 is called block level striping.\n\n215\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.600\nNow block level, what we mean by that is\nwhen a hard drive writes the data to your\n\n216\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.490\nlocations on those platters or\ninto an electronic storage,\n\n217\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.550\nit's writing chunks of your information.\n\n218\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.910\nSo I call it block level storage,\nright, block level striping.\n\n219\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.120\nNow, what does striping actually mean for\nus?\n\n220\n00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.390\nWell, what striping\nmeans is that in RAID 0,\n\n221\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:06.750\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna have\nthe first data that needs to be write.\n\n222\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.000\nOkay, so take a large block of your,\nhuge block of your information.\n\n223\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.020\nWhen you are gonna write your information\nto the hard drive, you're gonna write\n\n224\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.390\nonce to this drive, and you're gonna\nwrite the next chunk to this drive.\n\n225\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.970\nThen you're gonna come back and you're\ngonna write that following chunk, and\n\n226\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.670\nagain, sequentially here,\nto this drive and\n\n227\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.150\nthen the following block to this drive.\n\n228\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.240\nSo notice that your information,\npieces of your information,\n\n229\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.710\nare being striped across the drives,\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.940\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nthey called it stripe.\n\n231\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.010\nSo if I take that information if\nyou think what we're doing here,\n\n232\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:48.880\nwe start here on drive one and\nwe write the next chunk to this drive.\n\n233\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.580\nAnd then we come down from here and we\nwrite the next chunk to this drive, right?\n\n234\n00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.360\nAnd then following so\nforth, so on and so forth.\n\n235\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.430\nSo you end up having this\nstriping that they call it.\n\n236\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.880\nNow, what does this do for you?\n\n237\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.730\nAll right, one of the things that it does\nis imagine just having a single drive.\n\n238\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.770\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's just take a single drive.\n\n239\n00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.060\nWe take everything else out of there,\nright?\n\n240\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.450\nAnd if we're gonna write here,\nwe've got to write our data\n\n241\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.330\nsequentially to the different\nlocations on a single drive, and\n\n242\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.310\nthat's gonna slow us down a little bit.\n\n243\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.850\nBut if I can break that information\nup into those smaller chunks, and\n\n244\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.470\nwhat we do is, and what we do is here\n\n245\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.940\nwrite smaller pieces\nacross multiple disks.\n\n246\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.496\nThen what we get the ability to do is\nspeed up our write times cause I don't\n\n247\n00:12:35.496 --> 00:12:38.293\nwant to have to write the whole\nthing to a single disk, and\n\n248\n00:12:38.293 --> 00:12:41.294\nwait for all that information\nto be written in a large block.\n\n249\n00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:45.298\nI can break it up into chunks\nacross the whole entire drive, or\n\n250\n00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.002\nthe multitude of drives.\n\n251\n00:12:47.002 --> 00:12:49.960\nSo RAID 0, it requires two disks, right?\n\n252\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.110\nThat's your array,\nmultiple disk aggregated together.\n\n253\n00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.390\nRequires two disks but what it does is it\ngives you a performance increase because\n\n254\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:01.110\nyou're breaking your data up and writing\nsmaller chunks across multiple drives.\n\n255\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.740\nIt also gives you a read increase,\nbecause when you read the information\n\n256\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.400\nyou're reading from multiple controllers,\nright?\n\n257\n00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.190\nThink about a multitasker, right?\n\n258\n00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.690\nIf I'm doing something with one hand and\nI've got one drive, right?\n\n259\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.641\nI am doing something with one hand I\ncan't, I got a bound on that, right,\n\n260\n00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:17.180\nI can only do so much.\n\n261\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.310\nBut if I can do the same thing with both\nhands, now I could increase how much\n\n262\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.240\nproductivity I can get done by\ndoing things with two hands.\n\n263\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.131\nIt's the same thing with the two drives,\nright?\n\n264\n00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:29.953\nI have two drive controllers giving\nme smaller portions of each piece of\n\n265\n00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:33.370\ninformation and\nit can multitask a lot faster.\n\n266\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.300\nIt's RAID level zero,\nit gives me zero redundancy.\n\n267\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.499\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n268\n00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:41.324\nNow it increases the performance if you\nwill of the time that it takes to read\n\n269\n00:13:41.324 --> 00:13:45.151\nyour information and the time that it\ntakes to write your information, but\n\n270\n00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:47.240\nthe problem here is, look at our data.\n\n271\n00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.077\nLet's say our data is one through eight.\n\n272\n00:13:50.077 --> 00:13:54.495\nZach notice what happens is, let's\nsay we simulate a hard drive failure,\n\n273\n00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:56.550\nall right, what data have I lost?\n\n274\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.490\nHave I lost half my data?\n\n275\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.490\nWell really, what happens is you've\nlost all your information, right.\n\n276\n00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.615\nThere's no way to recover the information,\nno way for the RAID controller or\n\n277\n00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:09.107\nthe drive controller for\nthat matter to understand what's missing.\n\n278\n00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:09.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nSo\n\n279\n00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:15.328\nRAID 0 isn't about if you will the speed,\nexcuse me,\n\n280\n00:14:15.328 --> 00:14:21.960\nis about redundancy as it is\nmore about a performance gain.\n\n281\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.939\nAnd keep that in mind.\n\n282\n00:14:22.939 --> 00:14:28.870\nKeep in mind that it also takes a minimum\nof two drives to implement RAID 0.\n\n283\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.907\nNow, we said redundancy, and\nthe very first standard I give you I say,\n\n284\n00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:36.559\ndoesn't do redundancy, so\nboy, that's confusing, right?\n\n285\n00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:37.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n286\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.210\nthat's what they call it RAID level zero.\n\n287\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.791\nNow, when we get in the higher\nlevels of RAID, right,\n\n288\n00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:45.290\nnow we are talking about implementing\nsome level of redundancy, right.\n\n289\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.890\nRedundancy is more than one so\nI achieve tolerance and the fact that\n\n290\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.300\nwe have one drive fails, I still have\naccess to my information, right?\n\n291\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.550\nAnd that's where something\nknown as RAID 1 comes in.\n\n292\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.860\nNow, when RAID 1 comes in,\nlet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n293\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.084\nWe're doing something kind of unique here,\nkinda cool, right.\n\n294\n00:15:03.084 --> 00:15:05.862\nAnd RAID 1 says, it's called mirroring.\n\n295\n00:15:05.862 --> 00:15:08.230\nAll right.\nRAID 1 is block level,\n\n296\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.660\nnot block level striping,\nexcuse me, block level mirroring.\n\n297\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.250\nAgain, chunks that's the blocks.\n\n298\n00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.530\nIt's not bit by bit,\nit's a block of your data.\n\n299\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.450\nAnd it's written twice, all right.\n\n300\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.310\nAnd what that means is that the mirror\nsays if I write to this hard drive,\n\n301\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.710\nI'm gonna write an identical\ncopy to the second drive.\n\n302\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.850\nAnd you can actually expand this up to\nwhere you can increase the capacities,\n\n303\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:31.940\nif you will, as well.\n\n304\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.450\nWe'll talk a little bit about capacity,\ncoming up.\n\n305\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.840\nAnd that's essentially what mirror is.\n\n306\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.270\nThe second right is gonna be\nwritten to this hard drive.\n\n307\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.970\nAnd it's gonna have to be duplicated.\n\n308\n00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.719\nAn identical copy is gonna be\nwritten to the second drive.\n\n309\n00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.400\nAnd so on and so on and so forth.\n\n310\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.640\nAnd that's why they call it mirroring.\n\n311\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.187\nCuz you have an identical copy of\nyour information on both drives.\n\n312\n00:15:51.187 --> 00:15:56.770\nSo now let's say, we come in after a great\nweekend and we've got a drive failure.\n\n313\n00:15:57.955 --> 00:15:58.900\nNotice what happens to my information.\n\n314\n00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.000\n&gt;&gt; It's still there.\n\n315\n00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.449\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nI've achieved redundancy because of\n\n316\n00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:07.080\nthe fact that I still have an identical\ncopy of that information waiting for me.\n\n317\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.560\nAnd that's one of the benefits,\nif you will, of RAID 1.\n\n318\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.780\nRAID 1 is your first level of redundancy,\nall right?\n\n319\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.490\nAnd that is a very, very good thing.\n\n320\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.310\nHowever, keep in mind, if we lose both\ndrives, obviously, we lose our data.\n\n321\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.120\nNow before I get to the next one,\nI wanna kind of jump back and\n\n322\n00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.450\ntalk about capacities.\n\n323\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.190\nOkay, cuz capacity is important, and\n\n324\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.262\nit might be something that they ask you on\nthe exam, and you need to be aware of it.\n\n325\n00:16:31.262 --> 00:16:35.453\nAll right, so let's say, let's see\nhow good I can do this on the fly.\n\n326\n00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:39.998\nYou should always modify things off\nthe cuff, [LAUGH] in a live show,\n\n327\n00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.924\nwell, live recorded show.\n\n328\n00:16:41.924 --> 00:16:45.741\nLet's say that I have, and this is\njust because Wes' math is horrible,\n\n329\n00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:48.638\nlet's say this is 100 gigabyte drive,\nall right?\n\n330\n00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:52.540\nI have two 100 gigabyte drives, all right.\n\n331\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.980\nWell when I look at striping,\nto figure out the capacity,\n\n332\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.340\nit's the sum total of the entire\ncapacity of the RAID.\n\n333\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.388\nEach drive added up becomes what your\ntotal number is, your total capacity.\n\n334\n00:17:05.388 --> 00:17:08.500\nAll right, so 200, and\nthat's one of the good things about RAID.\n\n335\n00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.170\nWhile it doesn't give you false tolerance,\nit does give you a performance increase.\n\n336\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.571\nIt gives you one of the best\nof the capacities, all right?\n\n337\n00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:20.170\nSo I have a 200 gig array, you might\nhear that term, I got a 200 gig array.\n\n338\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.180\nAnd if I wanna increase the speeds, that's\nall right, all you have to do is sit here,\n\n339\n00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.540\nand I'm not gonna mix and\nmatch the numbers here.\n\n340\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.060\nBut all I have to do is add another drive,\nright?\n\n341\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.940\nAnd now I have three controllers.\n\n342\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.330\nAnd now we're going sequentially\nacross three controllers, right?\n\n343\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.161\nSo you could see that you\nincrease the speed as well.\n\n344\n00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, but if you use the drive,\nyou'll lose the information.\n\n345\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.460\n&gt;&gt; That's right, he's learning.\n\n346\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.000\nThat's right, exactly.\n\n347\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.813\n&gt;&gt; He's teaching.\n\n348\n00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:46.420\n&gt;&gt; And\nit does not matter if you lose one drive.\n\n349\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.262\nI don't care if you have 14\ndrives in your array, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:48.262 --> 00:17:51.710\nI think 15's the max according\nto the status standard.\n\n351\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.050\nBut don't worry about that right now.\n\n352\n00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.500\nJust understand, it doesn't matter how\nmany drives you have in the array,\n\n353\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.420\nyou're gonna lose it.\n\n354\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.030\nWhen you figure out capacity,\nadd the total capacity up of the entirety.\n\n355\n00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.340\nWhat I mean by is add each individual\ndrive, that becomes your capacity.\n\n356\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.441\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's take that same example, and\n\n357\n00:18:08.441 --> 00:18:10.920\nlet's go back over to our RAID 1,\nall right?\n\n358\n00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.900\nAnd what we'll do is we'll say now\nwe have 100 gigs and 100 gigs.\n\n359\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.027\nNow here's where mirroring,\nit benefits you, right?\n\n360\n00:18:19.027 --> 00:18:19.759\nAll right,\n\n361\n00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:24.898\nit benefits you cuz of the fact that you\nget the ability to gain redundancy, right?\n\n362\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.990\nHere's where it hits you a little bit.\n\n363\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.882\nBecause you're writing\nyour information twice,\n\n364\n00:18:30.882 --> 00:18:33.244\nit slows down your write speeds, right?\n\n365\n00:18:33.244 --> 00:18:37.060\nYou think about this if you've ever\nhad to tell somebody something twice.\n\n366\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.841\nAll right, and I don't mean this to\nbe rude or anything, but just, okay,\n\n367\n00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:42.310\nif I tell you a third time,\nyou're wasting my time.\n\n368\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.700\nRight, but I've told you twice now, right?\n\n369\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.426\nSo I've had to tell you more times,\nit's kind of slowed down our progress.\n\n370\n00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:50.480\n&gt;&gt; So you, physically,\nhave to write it twice.\n\n371\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.586\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nwhen I say you physically, keep in mind,\n\n372\n00:18:52.586 --> 00:18:53.770\nit's the hardware underlining.\n\n373\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.710\nYou don't actually see this.\n\n374\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.440\nYou configure an array inside of\nthe storage mechanism, and essentially,\n\n375\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.780\nwhat it does is it's doing the write.\n\n376\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.928\nSo when I say you, keep in mind,\n\n377\n00:19:00.928 --> 00:19:03.112\nI'm actually talking array\n[CROSSTALK] that's doing that.\n\n378\n00:19:03.112 --> 00:19:06.765\nNow here's one of the downfalls\nto mirroring, all right,\n\n379\n00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:08.600\nis that it can get expensive.\n\n380\n00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.873\nBecause you're losing the amount\nof capacity, all right,\n\n381\n00:19:12.873 --> 00:19:16.140\nbecause I have to write\nmy information twice,\n\n382\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:22.730\nif I have 100 gigs of data out here that I\nhave to write, I have to write it twice.\n\n383\n00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.330\nAnd if I have to write 100 gigs twice,\nessentially,\n\n384\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:29.270\nwhat I'm doing is losing one of\nthe capacities of the drives.\n\n385\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.070\nSo understanding a mirror\nlike this with two drives,\n\n386\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.810\nthe total capacity is\nthe capacity of a single drive.\n\n387\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.380\nAnd that's something to understand.\n\n388\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.200\nRight, if I have a four-way mirror, right,\nI might have four 100 gigabyte drives, but\n\n389\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.040\nI'm gonna mirror it four different times,\nI'm gonna have only 100 gigs.\n\n390\n00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.590\nSo it does get a little bit\ncost expensive when it comes to\n\n391\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.110\nthe amount of storage cuz\nyou actually lose storage.\n\n392\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.781\nYou benefit in redundancy, you lose\na little bit of the write speeds, right,\n\n393\n00:19:56.781 --> 00:19:59.780\ncuz you have to do things twice or\nmore than twice, right?\n\n394\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.830\nBut you also lose some of the overall\ncapacity of the drive as well.\n\n395\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.570\nNow, the next one,\nthe next one's kinda interesting.\n\n396\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.961\nI really like this one because\nthis one's called RAID 5.\n\n397\n00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:15.580\nAnd RAID 5, understand right away,\ntakes a minimum of three disks, okay?\n\n398\n00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.572\nNow, notice that there's a little\nbit more information in here than\n\n399\n00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:21.340\njust our standard blocks\nthat we've been writing.\n\n400\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.462\nNotice that I write to one disk.\n\n401\n00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:27.500\nThen I write to the second\ndisk the second write.\n\n402\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.160\nSo we've got a stripe going on, right?\n\n403\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.390\nNotice that RAID 5 has a stripe going,\nwrite to this drive, write to this drive.\n\n404\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.770\nBut notice what happens\nto the third drive.\n\n405\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.061\nThe third drive is where we write\nsomething known as a parity bit.\n\n406\n00:20:40.061 --> 00:20:43.328\nAnd like we talked about\nin our memory episode,\n\n407\n00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:47.360\nparity is about error detection and\ncorrection.\n\n408\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.329\nSee, RAID 5 is called block\nlevel striping, again,\n\n409\n00:20:50.329 --> 00:20:54.537\ncuz we're striping our information\nacross the three drives within the set.\n\n410\n00:20:54.537 --> 00:20:57.366\nBut then after the writes,\n\n411\n00:20:57.366 --> 00:21:03.300\nwe end up having a parity\nbit that's added, all right?\n\n412\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.910\nAnd the parity bit allows us to calculate\ninformation when one of the drives fails\n\n413\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.770\nto understand what's still going.\n\n414\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.360\nAnd let me go into a little bit more about\nthis because when we talk about RAID 5,\n\n415\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.770\nit's actually block level striping with\nwhat's known as distributed parity.\n\n416\n00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.620\nBecause as you'll notice, the parity bit,\nas they call it, the parity information\n\n417\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.540\nis distributed across all three drives,\nand that's important, right?\n\n418\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.130\nBecause what happens when\none of these drives fails\n\n419\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.730\nis the fact that the drive controller\nstill knows what's going on.\n\n420\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.980\nCan still figure out the data that's\nbeen striped, which is interesting.\n\n421\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.630\nRemember if I have a stripe by itself and\none of the drives fails,\n\n422\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.600\nit doesn't know that\nwe've lost everything.\n\n423\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.860\nBut now in this instance of striping,\n\n424\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.560\nbecause we've lost a drive and\nwe have distributed parity,\n\n425\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.350\nthe drive controller or\nthe RAID controller knows what's going on.\n\n426\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.870\nIt knows and can figure out\nthe information that's missing\n\n427\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.950\nbased on the distributed parity bit.\n\n428\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.240\nAnd that's one of the great things.\n\n429\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.430\nThe other thing that's good is,\nand in the first part of this,\n\n430\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.820\nwe talked about hot swappable, and\nI mentioned, Zach, how if I come in and\n\n431\n00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.830\nI've got a blinking red light,\nI have to replace that drive.\n\n432\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.212\nRAID 5 arrays are great because they're\nhot swappable, and if I have a RAID 5\n\n433\n00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:17.130\narray with multiple disks in it,\nminimum of three, and I come in and\n\n434\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.280\none of those drives has failed,\nI can pull it out with the power still on.\n\n435\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.876\nI can replace the drive, and because of\nthat parity bit, the drive controllers and\n\n436\n00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:28.423\nthe RAID controller can rebuild\nthe entirety of that drive, and\n\n437\n00:22:28.423 --> 00:22:30.084\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n438\n00:22:30.084 --> 00:22:30.990\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n439\n00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.140\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the great things.\n\n440\n00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.200\nSo it implements redundancy with striping.\n\n441\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.220\nNow you might say, well, that's gotta be,\nI got the best of both worlds.\n\n442\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.961\nWell, yes and no.\n\n443\n00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:45.420\nAll right, here's where you take\na little bit of a hit, right?\n\n444\n00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.473\nYes, you do get a little\nbit of a performance gain,\n\n445\n00:22:49.473 --> 00:22:52.688\nespecially when it comes to your reads.\n\n446\n00:22:52.688 --> 00:22:57.900\nI guess your reads still do well.\n\n447\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.600\nYour writes slow down a little bit\ncuz you have to add extra data,\n\n448\n00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.480\nyou have to add parity information.\n\n449\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.530\nBut the other thing to\nkeep in mind is that\n\n450\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.780\nthe RAID controller has\nto calculate parity.\n\n451\n00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.620\nAny time you calculate parity,\n\n452\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.910\nyou get an overhead on your\nprocessing from the RAID controller.\n\n453\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:21.190\nSo you take a performance drop,\nbecause you have to calculate\n\n454\n00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.710\nother stuff other than your\ninformation inside of that array.\n\n455\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.690\nSo remember RAID 5,\nminimum of three disks, right?\n\n456\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.050\nI lose one of the disks,\nthe stripe is still functional.\n\n457\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.043\nWe're gonna lose performance, but\nwe're not out of the water, right?\n\n458\n00:23:36.043 --> 00:23:41.029\nAnd also keep in mind that we do have\nto consider a couple things, and\n\n459\n00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:45.226\nanother thing, I should say,\nand that is the fact that,\n\n460\n00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:49.433\nremember we talked about our\ndrive capacities, right?\n\n461\n00:23:49.433 --> 00:23:53.810\nAnd one of the things that we had said\nis figuring out, like for instance,\n\n462\n00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.398\nin RAID 0 We mentioned the fact that you\nhave a total capacity of all the drives\n\n463\n00:23:58.398 --> 00:23:59.528\nindividually, or\n\n464\n00:23:59.528 --> 00:24:04.800\nyour total capacity as adding up all\nthe drive's capacity individually.\n\n465\n00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.450\nAnd the mirror, you lose, you only have,\nbasically, the capacity of one drive.\n\n466\n00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.444\nWell, with the RAID 5, let's go ahead and\ngo back to that and kinda think about\n\n467\n00:24:13.444 --> 00:24:17.610\nwhat the, how would we configure,\nhow would we figure that capacity out?\n\n468\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.260\nWell, this is very simple.\n\n469\n00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.840\nTake one of the drives,\ndrive capacities, set it to the side.\n\n470\n00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.374\nThat's all you have to do.\n\n471\n00:24:24.374 --> 00:24:25.030\nWhy?\n\n472\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:30.770\nBecause the parity information is equal\nto a single drive capacity in an array.\n\n473\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.890\nSo like I said, you wanna figure out\nwhat the capacity is on the exam?\n\n474\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.710\nThey give you something and\n\n475\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.110\nthey'll probably give you numbers\na little bit bigger than this.\n\n476\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.980\nIt's easy enough.\n\n477\n00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.060\nJust remove that one drive capacity.\n\n478\n00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.680\nNow you can see I've got a 200\ngigabyte RAID array, right?\n\n479\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.022\nThat's how big that array is.\n\n480\n00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:49.491\n&gt;&gt; With the RAID 5.\n\n481\n00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:50.990\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda easy to figure out.\n\n482\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.540\nAnd you could put more drives in a RAID\n5 configuration, you get six drives.\n\n483\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.540\nStill easy to find out.\n\n484\n00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.870\nTake one drive capacity, remove it,\nand add up the other five drives and\n\n485\n00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.240\nyou got the total.\n\n486\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.200\nNow because of the fact that it takes\na little bit of the computational power\n\n487\n00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.000\nto calculate the parity bit,\nthis is especially with gamers, right?\n\n488\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.460\nGamers don't spend thousands of\ndollars on their, well they do,\n\n489\n00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.050\nbut give me a second let\nme finish this thought.\n\n490\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.010\nThey don't spend thousands of dollars on\ntheir systems to get slow performance.\n\n491\n00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.720\nSo what happened is now we\nwant the best of both worlds.\n\n492\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.660\nWe want not only speed of striping,\nbut we also want the redundancy, and\n\n493\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.680\nwe don't wanna take the performance\nhit that calculating parity does and\n\n494\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.370\nthat's where the very last one comes in.\n\n495\n00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.260\nThis is called sometimes you hear\nit called a couple of things,\n\n496\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.929\nthe most common thing is a Nested RAID,\n\n497\n00:25:34.929 --> 00:25:39.190\nwhere you take one RAID technology and\nnest it in another one.\n\n498\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.690\nYou might even hear it called Hybrid RAID,\nit's more commonly though it's nested.\n\n499\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:47.900\nAnd Nested RAID is what we have\nwhen we talk about RAID 10.\n\n500\n00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.435\nAll right, when we talk about RAID 10,\nlet's go ahead and look at that.\n\n501\n00:25:51.435 --> 00:25:57.788\nWhat we end up having is we have a set\nof drives that not only blends RAID 1,\n\n502\n00:25:57.788 --> 00:26:05.720\nall right, the mirroring, notice I have\nmirrored sets, and they're striped.\n\n503\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.640\nAll right, and\nthat's essentially what RAID 10 is.\n\n504\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.450\nI have a few striped mirrors if you will.\n\n505\n00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:18.040\nNotice that we have two hard\ndrives that are a RAID 1,\n\n506\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.740\nthen we have two hard drives\nthat are also a RAID 1.\n\n507\n00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.918\nBut notice what's happening\nto the upper level RAID.\n\n508\n00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:29.300\nRight, I guess I have a mirror, but\nI also have the stripe going on and\n\n509\n00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.650\nwe do this across all four drives.\n\n510\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.140\nNow what's the benefit of this?\n\n511\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.990\nIf you look at any one of these drives,\n\n512\n00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.150\nif it fails,\nI still have every bit of my data and\n\n513\n00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.170\nthe RAID array is still functional and\nthere's no calculation of the parity bit.\n\n514\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.660\nSo now I get speed, and\n\n515\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.980\nI get the performance, if you will,\nI get the fault tolerance.\n\n516\n00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.920\nHowever, keep in mind this\nis a very expensive setup.\n\n517\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.913\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was just gonna ask that.\n\n518\n00:26:52.913 --> 00:26:54.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's probably pricier.\n\n519\n00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is very pricey, and\nyou would be absolutely right.\n\n520\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.810\nCan you tell me why?\n\n521\n00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:59.720\nYou think about that?\n\n522\n00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's the number of disks,\nit's the number of functions,\n\n523\n00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.700\nit's functionality, it's the whole bit.\n\n524\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.808\n&gt;&gt; It's the number of\ndisks that it requires.\n\n525\n00:27:06.808 --> 00:27:10.213\nIt requires a minimum of four drives, so\nyou're gonna have to have a minimum of\n\n526\n00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:12.385\nfour drives to support\na RAID 10 configuration.\n\n527\n00:27:12.385 --> 00:27:17.600\nSo again, pros and cons to everything but\nkeep in mind this is all about having both\n\n528\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.533\nthe ability to mirror the drives for\nthe fault tolerance as well as striping.\n\n529\n00:27:22.533 --> 00:27:27.300\nSo you get the performance gain with\nan overall cost hit, if you will.\n\n530\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.050\nThose are some of the different RAID\ntypes that I would be familiar with on\n\n531\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:30.710\nthis exam.\n\n532\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.170\nAnd please understand them,\ncuz they very well could ask you\n\n533\n00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.530\nnot only what are the RAID types, but also\nhow to calculate what the size might be.\n\n534\n00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:42.694\n&gt;&gt; Install and configure storage devices,\nA+ 901 part three, and\n\n535\n00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:45.582\nthere's part two [LAUGH] and\nthere's part one.\n\n536\n00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:48.190\nAnd you can watch them all whenever\nyou want, which is a wonderful thing.\n\n537\n00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.980\nWes, marvelous, good job.\n\n538\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.860\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV, remember,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n539\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.640\nI know I am too.\n\n540\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.440\nI'm Zach

00:00:16.920\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.010\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.270\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n9\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.180\nwe are moving on with more\nof our A+ 220-901 series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.482\nWhat a fun, fun thing to say.\n\n11\n00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.940\nAnd joining me in the studio is\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.110\nWes?\n&gt;&gt; It's great to be here\n\n13\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.790\ntoday, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.560\nAnd we are going to be looking at, well,\nthe brains of the operation, right?\n\n15\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.860\nIn the past episodes we've been talking\nabout things like your motherboard, right?\n\n16\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.440\nThe motherboard is really\nthe backbone of the entire\n\n17\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.030\nsystem unit as we call it, right?\n\n18\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.650\nThe overall Tower,\nmotherboard if you will,\n\n19\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.040\nstorage drives, or\nhard drives if you will, storage devices.\n\n20\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.450\nSo we need to look at what really gets\nour information processed, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.400\nWhat is responsible,\nif you will, for calculating,\n\n22\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.740\nmaking the critical calculations that\nreally run the entire computing industry.\n\n23\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.950\nAnd that's something known as a CPU.\n\n24\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.800\nAnd, of course, just like any other A+\nseries, we wouldn't be without acronyms,\n\n25\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.290\na little bit of theory,\nand some specifications.\n\n26\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.830\nSo when we look at CPU, right,\nwhat is a CPU responsible for?\n\n27\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.100\nBut it is what really just\ndoes all the arithmetic,\n\n28\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.520\ndoes the logical calculations,\nif you will.\n\n29\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.990\nWhen it comes to working\nwith applications,\n\n30\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.810\nwhen it comes to working your data.\n\n31\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.490\nIt is really one of the major\ncomponents that we have inside of\n\n32\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.280\nthe system unit collectively.\n\n33\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.380\n&gt;&gt; One of a big four they say.\n\n34\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.770\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n35\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.210\nI always call them the four horsemen.\n\n36\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about the CPU,\n\n37\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.690\nyou're talking about your networking,\n\n38\n00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690\nyou're talking about your hard drive,\nif you will.\n\n39\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.730\nAnd RAM, right?\n\n40\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.950\nMemory, so yes,\ndefinitely one of the major components.\n\n41\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.000\nAnd it's really important to understand,\nwhen it comes to a CPU,\n\n42\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.850\nsome of the characteristics\nthat they call out on the exam.\n\n43\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.810\nAnd not only just from a theory standpoint\nor from a certification standpoint.\n\n44\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.750\nBut just basically to kind of\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n45\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.380\nNow, in the earlier days when we\ntalked about CPUs, CPUs were very,\n\n46\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.730\nvery large devices.\n\n47\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.160\nAnd some of these devices had different\nsocket types we've talked about in past\n\n48\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.710\nepisodes.\n\n49\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.150\nWe've talked about the two\nmajor different socket types.\n\n50\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.320\nAnd remember the socket is what\nreally makes the connection to\n\n51\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.130\nthe motherboard between the CPU itself and\nthe motherboard.\n\n52\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.990\nNow we also made a mention of a couple\ndifferent types of sockets, right?\n\n53\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.290\nThere are a few different types out there,\nbut largely today, the two big guys on\n\n54\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.400\nthe block, right, Intel and AMD have\nreally kind of parted ways, if you will.\n\n55\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.870\nIf they were ever together to begin with.\n\n56\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.870\nThey've kind of parted ways,\n\n57\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.150\nand each different manufacturer has\nkind of made its choice, right?\n\n58\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.050\nThey've crossed that line in the sand and\n\n59\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.610\nthey've got two different\nsocket types that they follow.\n\n60\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.450\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram here.\n\n61\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.060\nLet's kinda talk about the CPU.\n\n62\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.220\nThis is what's knows as an LGA CPU.\n\n63\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.570\nThis is where Intel went.\n\n64\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.570\nAnd if you know,\nit's called LAN grid array.\n\n65\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.410\nAnd when we look at the LANs here,\nif you will,\n\n66\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.611\nthey're just little pieces of flat metal,\nright?\n\n67\n00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:03.340\nFlatt copper, if you will, gold,\nprobably a little gold in there as well.\n\n68\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.310\nYou can even find things like platinum\nacross your motherboards, too.\n\n69\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.880\nAnd if you notice that they're\nflat electrical contacts-\n\n70\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.260\n&gt;&gt; Because back in the day they used to be\n\n71\n00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.650\nlike sharp little pins that stuck off.\n\n72\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.450\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n73\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.840\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlet's follow that train of thought, too.\n\n74\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.250\nSo Intel, they stay with LGA, right?\n\n75\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.020\nThe land grid array.\n\n76\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.200\nBut what Dan's talking about is, well,\nsomething that pretty much AMD went with.\n\n77\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.160\nWell, that's the socket type.\n\n78\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.060\nLet's try there.\nThere's the pin grid array, right?\n\n79\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.330\nAnd you can see that\nthere's a series of pins.\n\n80\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.640\nNow, these are two major types of CPUs,\nand\n\n81\n00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.540\nthey're pretty much what you find in\nall of your computing devices today.\n\n82\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.590\nNow I do want to say that mobile devices\nhave kind of changed the way we think of\n\n83\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.480\nCPUs too.\n\n84\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.200\nBut we're not really\nin our mobile section.\n\n85\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.660\nI will say that you also find still CPUs\nsoldered directly to the motherboard.\n\n86\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.100\nThey're called SMDs, or\nsurface mount devices.\n\n87\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.890\nBut in this episode,\nwe're going to talk about primarily\n\n88\n00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.810\nthese two different types of CPUs,\nif I can find the CPU there.\n\n89\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.500\nLand grid array,\nnotice the flat electrical contacts.\n\n90\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.160\nNow remember I said that the,\nin another episode,\n\n91\n00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.080\nthe land grid array has a certain\ntype of socket and its unique to it.\n\n92\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.500\nAnd this what is known as an LGA socket.\n\n93\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.820\nNow, the LGA socket,\nif we kind of zoom in here,\n\n94\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.330\nI want you to understand that\nit's kind of like a bed of nails.\n\n95\n00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.020\nNow, it's not really nails, right?\n\n96\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.810\nWe don't have the Iron Maiden\ngoing on here.\n\n97\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.110\nBut what we have is\nthe electrical contact.\n\n98\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.223\n&gt;&gt; That'd be awesome [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.010\n&gt;&gt; That'd be great, right?\n\n100\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.090\nYou can see that what we have here\nare pins that are really, actually kind of\n\n101\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.380\nthe electrical contacts are sticking\nup inside of the circuit themselves.\n\n102\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.037\nAnd if you look, we've kinda get\nthis little hood if you will,\n\n103\n00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.457\nthat we can pull down, and it flaps down.\n\n104\n00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:44.130\nAnd it's a little latch will actually\npress the top of that cover, and really,\n\n105\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.098\nreally give some tension there.\n\n106\n00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:50.438\nAnd it will press, if you will,\nthrough pressure, I guess I should say,\n\n107\n00:04:50.438 --> 00:04:52.725\nthe CPU down into the socket.\n\n108\n00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.205\nNow, this is what Intel goes with.\n\n109\n00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:55.925\nThis is their socket types.\n\n110\n00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.905\nIt's been their socket types for\na very long time.\n\n111\n00:04:57.905 --> 00:04:59.905\nI think, briefly,\nthey did have a PGA socket, but\n\n112\n00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:02.610\nthey kind of said, okay,\nwe're gonna go LGA.\n\n113\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.520\nNow the PGA socket that lines up kinda\n\n114\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.460\nwith the pin grid array as you\ncan see a series of pins here.\n\n115\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.310\nThis is what AMD,\nAdvanced Micro Devices went with.\n\n116\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.650\nAnd their socket types you'll\nsee right here as well.\n\n117\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.070\nAnd you can kinda see\nthat acronym right there.\n\n118\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.100\nThis is an old PGA370 socket.\n\n119\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.400\nSo what's kind of interesting,\nI think this is actually an Intel socket.\n\n120\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.847\nThis is one of those old Intel-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n121\n00:05:23.847 --> 00:05:26.020\n&gt;&gt; PGA base sockets.\n\n122\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Before they went away from this type.\n\n123\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so the concept is really\nthe same, and that's what they have today.\n\n124\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.050\nSo you have LGA-based sockets, right?\n\n125\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.230\nYou have PGA-based sockets.\n\n126\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.640\nNote that on the exam.\n\n127\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.030\nBut I also want you to understand that\nwhen you're making a decision on what\n\n128\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.130\nCPU that you're going to implement, which\none you're gonna buy, you're very strict.\n\n129\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.340\nWe don't mix and match, right?\n\n130\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.150\nIntel for Intel baseboards, AMD for\nAMD baseboards, LGA versus PGA.\n\n131\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.915\nNow, there's some other characteristics.\n\n132\n00:05:54.915 --> 00:05:58.715\nThe CPUs that we want you to be aware of\ntoo and they call out quite a few, right?\n\n133\n00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:00.285\nThey call speed.\n\n134\n00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:02.905\nNow when we look at speed,\nspeed is usually measured in, well,\n\n135\n00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.325\nit is measured in Hertz.\n\n136\n00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:07.575\nAnd, if you will,\nHertz is what's known as a clock rate.\n\n137\n00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.745\nNow I want you to think of\nthis like a pulse, right?\n\n138\n00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.425\nThink of this as heartbeat\nof the CPU itself, right?\n\n139\n00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:16.050\nFor every Hert, we get a single\nclock speed, or a clock cycle.\n\n140\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.490\nNow, when we look at clock cycles,\nclock cycles are how\n\n141\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.920\nmany operations that the CPU\ncan perform in a given second.\n\n142\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.610\nNow, this is what's kind of impressive.\n\n143\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.280\nAnd this is what I think is\njust absolutely amazing about\n\n144\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.590\nthe people that have\nengineered CPUs in general.\n\n145\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.720\nThat today's processors\ncan process on average,\n\n146\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.720\naround 3.2 to 3.6 billion\ncalculations in a given second.\n\n147\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.940\nThat's pretty astronomical.\n\n148\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.580\nAnd that's why we've\nalso talked about the CPU\n\n149\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.090\nreally is the fastest\nthing on the motherboard.\n\n150\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.710\nThere's nothing on the motherboard\nthat is faster than a CPU.\n\n151\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.900\nIt's one of the reasons we talk also\nabout using random access memory.\n\n152\n00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.280\nCuz access speeds\nare measured in nanoseconds.\n\n153\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.210\nAnd now what you're doing,\nwhen you start talking about nanoseconds,\n\n154\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:11.370\nwe're talking about now, we're close\nto the level that a processor operates.\n\n155\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.410\nSo keep that in mind,\nthat clock speed if you will,\n\n156\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:22.050\nis how many operations that the CPU\nitself can perform in a given second.\n\n157\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.951\n&gt;&gt; So,\nif I've got a 2.8 gigahertz processor,\n\n158\n00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.130\nit's doing 2.8 billion\nprocesses per second?\n\n159\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Very good,\nthat's absolutely correct too.\n\n160\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.990\nNow, don't let the numbers game fool you.\n\n161\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.360\nBecause just like in many\nthings inside of technology,\n\n162\n00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.020\ninside the computing world, manufacturers\nreally like their number games, all right?\n\n163\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.380\nAnd it really is a numbers game.\n\n164\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.910\nSo you might find that, for\ninstance, depending on, and\n\n165\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.930\nI'm talking within a family.\n\n166\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.639\nI'm not talking about\nthis long-time battle\n\n167\n00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.161\nbetween people who love Intel versus\npeople who say, hey, I can afford AMD.\n\n168\n00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:54.174\nI'm talking just take Intel processors.\n\n169\n00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:57.508\nWe won't even worry about AMD,\nor just take AMD processors.\n\n170\n00:07:57.508 --> 00:08:00.512\nWhen you have a processor That\nmight be 2.8 gigahertz, and\n\n171\n00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:02.662\nyou have another one that's 3 gigahertz.\n\n172\n00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:06.117\nNow by the numbers you would\nsay 3 gigahertz, that's got to\n\n173\n00:08:06.117 --> 00:08:09.045\nbe processing more information-\n&gt;&gt; But that's [CROSSTALK] it works.\n\n174\n00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:10.800\n&gt;&gt; But not necessarily so,\nthat's right, exactly.\n\n175\n00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.895\n&gt;&gt; More is better, obviously.\n\n176\n00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:15.140\n&gt;&gt; And one would think higher numbers,\nmore numbers means more calculations.\n\n177\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.640\nBut is kind of interesting because,\nlike I said,\n\n178\n00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.100\neven within a certain\nfamily of processors,\n\n179\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.850\nthe way they process information\nmight be a little bit different.\n\n180\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.174\nAnd I kind of liken this,\nbecause well, I love food, right?\n\n181\n00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.332\nIf I was standing next to Dan, and\nwe both had a piece of pizza, and\n\n182\n00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:33.005\nyou were to measure it in a second.\n\n183\n00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:36.749\nI would almost put money that Dan would\nhave half that piece of pizza eaten,\n\n184\n00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.487\nbefore I even could see the pizza.\n\n185\n00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:41.397\nNow, notice the timeframe\nis still the same, but\n\n186\n00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:44.667\nit's how much information\nthat processor can bite up.\n\n187\n00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:48.339\nEven though the cycles,\nthe calculations are still the same,\n\n188\n00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:51.602\nsometimes they process\na little bit more efficiently.\n\n189\n00:08:51.602 --> 00:08:55.718\nSo for instance, a standard i7 processor,\nand you take a Xeon processor,\n\n190\n00:08:55.718 --> 00:09:00.049\nthat's a server-grade processor, and\ntheir clock speeds might be the same.\n\n191\n00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:03.828\nBut when you look at it, a Xeon, because\nit's an enterprise-level processor,\n\n192\n00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:07.470\nit's gonna process more information,\npotentially, in that given second.\n\n193\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.645\nSo don't let the numbers game fool you,\nwhat you really want to look at,\n\n194\n00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:13.261\ndo a little bit of research and\nlook at the specifications.\n\n195\n00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:17.459\nSo again, don't get too fooled\nin the numbers, just know for\n\n196\n00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:19.083\nthe exam what it means.\n\n197\n00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:20.842\nThat it's measured in Hertz,\n\n198\n00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:25.387\nand again, that it's how many calculations\nthat a CPU can do in a given second.\n\n199\n00:09:25.387 --> 00:09:27.514\nNow here's another thing, too.\n\n200\n00:09:27.514 --> 00:09:30.449\nAs processors have developed in the past,\n\n201\n00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:34.771\nwhat they've done is they've\ntaken the little silicon chip,\n\n202\n00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:39.920\nright, the little green chip,\nif you will, that's on that CPU.\n\n203\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.199\nAnd what they do is they've added\nadditional processing units,\n\n204\n00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:46.715\nwithin a single die of a chip,\nright, within that single square, and\n\n205\n00:09:46.715 --> 00:09:49.360\nthat's what's known as\nmulti-core processing.\n\n206\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.550\nNow in the earlier days, if we wanted\nto have more processing power,\n\n207\n00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.806\nright, be able to\ncalculate more information?\n\n208\n00:09:54.806 --> 00:09:59.003\nhen what you would do, is you would buy\na board, typically in enterprise-level\n\n209\n00:09:59.003 --> 00:10:02.907\nenvironments, that had multiple\nprocessors, more than one processor.\n\n210\n00:10:02.907 --> 00:10:06.728\nBut as time's gone on, these processors\nhave gotten smaller and smaller and\n\n211\n00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:07.267\nsmaller.\n\n212\n00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:11.312\nSo what they've been able to do is\nput more than one processing unit,\n\n213\n00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:15.990\nthe little chip in it that's able to\ncalculate information, on a single CPU.\n\n214\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.910\nAll right,\n\n215\n00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.391\nnow that's not called multi-CPU, what\nthat's called is multiple-core, right?\n\n216\n00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:26.080\nSo a multi-core is an individual\nprocessing unit that's\n\n217\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.210\npretty much on a single chip,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n218\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.040\nSo we've got a kind of an example,\nabstractly, here on my diagram here,\n\n219\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.490\nof a dual-core processor, again,\nthink of the cores themselves.\n\n220\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.729\nI believe they call them ALUs,\nit's arithmetic logic unit,\n\n221\n00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:42.657\nit's just a technical term for\nanother processor, and\n\n222\n00:10:42.657 --> 00:10:45.540\nit has made our processing\ncapabilities a lot better.\n\n223\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.289\nBecause if I can take the same little\nsquare, that little wafer if you will,\n\n224\n00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:53.051\nthat little silicon wafer, and rather\nthan have one processing unit on it.\n\n225\n00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:56.483\nWe can have multiple processing\nunits within the same space,\n\n226\n00:10:56.483 --> 00:11:00.052\nthen I want you to think of it\nkind of as a multi-tasker, right?\n\n227\n00:11:00.052 --> 00:11:03.138\nProcessors work on single\nthreads of information, but\n\n228\n00:11:03.138 --> 00:11:07.929\nif you take multiple processors within the\nsingle chip, you can have multiple threads\n\n229\n00:11:07.929 --> 00:11:10.900\nof information going into\nthe processor at one time.\n\n230\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.530\nAnd its like being able to do\nthe same exact calculations, well,\n\n231\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.841\ninstead of one hand, two hands, right?\n\n232\n00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:19.704\nYou image a quad-core processor,\nfour individual units,\n\n233\n00:11:19.704 --> 00:11:22.830\nnow is like having four-hand multi-tasker,\nright?\n\n234\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.501\nYou can process the information,\n\n235\n00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:27.445\nyou can calculate that information\na lot more efficiently.\n\n236\n00:11:27.445 --> 00:11:28.975\n&gt;&gt; It's like this lady\nI saw on TV one time,\n\n237\n00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:31.765\nwho could write two different sentences\nat the same time with both hands.\n\n238\n00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:33.373\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's crazy, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] she had\n\n239\n00:11:33.373 --> 00:11:34.419\nmultiprocessing, right?\n\n240\n00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:36.310\nShe's like, yeah,\nhere's two full sentences.\n\n241\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I look at the gentleman\nthat they based Rain Man off of.\n\n242\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.590\nHe can actually process one page, and\ntwo pages, he could read two pages-\n\n243\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.190\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n244\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.416\n&gt;&gt; At the same time, because of the way\nhis brain was split on the inside,\n\n245\n00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:49.342\nnot literally, but you know what I mean.\n\n246\n00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:50.524\n&gt;&gt; Right, taking in information,\nyeah, great, cool.\n\n247\n00:11:50.524 --> 00:11:54.416\n&gt;&gt; So it's just another one of those\nthings that's absolutely fascinating,\n\n248\n00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:58.671\nthat it's all electrical binary 1's and\n0's, electrical inputs, right, or\n\n249\n00:11:58.671 --> 00:12:01.490\npulses of information, if you will.\n\n250\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.620\nNow, one of the other characteristics that\nthey call out, when it comes to CPU's,\n\n251\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.550\nis something known as cache,\nand cache is interesting.\n\n252\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.557\n&gt;&gt; It's green, it's money,\nit sits in your pocket, it's awesome.\n\n253\n00:12:10.557 --> 00:12:14.217\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and you can make every\ncheck out to my last name as cash, right?\n\n254\n00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:14.731\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n255\n00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:17.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what does cache do for us,\n\n256\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.910\nhow does it benefit us within CPUs?\n\n257\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.980\nWell, we're talking about CPU\nprocessing speeds being four\n\n258\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.240\nbillion calculations in a given second,\nthe problem is\n\n259\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.980\nnothing else in the motherboard's\nfast enough to keep up with it.\n\n260\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.700\nEinstein said time is relative, right?\n\n261\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.270\nSo the eagles flies down out of the sky,\ngrabs that fish out of the water, to us,\n\n262\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.450\nit took maybe 30 seconds, 10 seconds or\nwhatever for him to fall out of the sky.\n\n263\n00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.880\nTo the eagle it could have been a century,\nright, it could have been a lifetime,\n\n264\n00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.230\ncuz time is relative.\n\n265\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.990\nWell the problem is, with everything in\nthe motherboard being slower than the CPU,\n\n266\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.890\nwhat if we had a set of instructions,\nright,\n\n267\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.600\na set of calculations that were\nhappening on a constant basis?\n\n268\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.064\nWould it be efficient to put it on\nthe motherboard, those calculations,\n\n269\n00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:03.600\nin the RAM, pull them out of RAM,\ncalculate them, put them back into RAM,\n\n270\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.977\nand then just keep doing that process?\n\n271\n00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:07.309\nAnd it's not really efficient that way.\n\n272\n00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:12.063\nSo a caching system is a way to take\na small portion, a very, very small amount\n\n273\n00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:17.128\nof memory, and put those commonly used\ninstructions right on the die of the chip.\n\n274\n00:13:17.128 --> 00:13:19.688\nSo rather than have to put\nit on an external bus,\n\n275\n00:13:19.688 --> 00:13:23.599\nthe electrical traces on the motherboard,\nand put it into main memory.\n\n276\n00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:26.867\nAnd then take it out of main memory,\nback across that data highway, and\n\n277\n00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:28.390\nback into the processor.\n\n278\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.340\nImagine being able, like the processor,\nto say, I've already got that information,\n\n279\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.840\nand it's sitting right next to me.\n\n280\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.165\nA cache system is that way,\nand it's usually grouped or\n\n281\n00:13:37.165 --> 00:13:40.720\nclassified in typically three\ndifferent layers, right?\n\n282\n00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.360\nWe have what's known as L1 cache,\nwe have L2 cache, and we have L3 cache.\n\n283\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.930\nNow L1 cache is the most expensive,\nand it's usually the smallest.\n\n284\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.655\nIt's usually one of the things that sets\nthe processor apart from other processors.\n\n285\n00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:58.002\nAnd the L1 cache, and even the L2 cache\ntoday, Dan, I know in the earlier days,\n\n286\n00:13:58.002 --> 00:14:00.473\nL2 cache might be external\nto the CPU itself.\n\n287\n00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:05.452\nBut today, L1 and L2 cache,\nare right there on the chip itself, within\n\n288\n00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:10.852\nthe processing, the die, again, that\nlittle square green piece [CROSSTALK].\n\n289\n00:14:10.852 --> 00:14:13.350\n&gt;&gt; Just cramming everything inside\nof that that nowadays, aren't they?\n\n290\n00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do, give you an example\nof another thing they cram in there,\n\n291\n00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.704\nthe memory controller,\nIntel's been doing this for a long time.\n\n292\n00:14:19.704 --> 00:14:23.366\nWe talked about the motherboard,\nthe northbridge, southbridge,\n\n293\n00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.596\nIntel calls them the MCH/ICH,\nthe memory controller hub.\n\n294\n00:14:26.596 --> 00:14:30.092\nThey said, there's no point in putting\nin the memory controller hub out\n\n295\n00:14:30.092 --> 00:14:33.980\nthere on the motherboard, and having\nthe processor wait to access memory.\n\n296\n00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.500\nLet me just take that\nmemory controller hub,\n\n297\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.680\nand we'll just sit it\nright inside of the CPU.\n\n298\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.840\nThey also put USB controllers\ninside the CPUs today,\n\n299\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.460\nand even integrated\ngraphics processing units.\n\n300\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.020\nThat’s right, your CPUs understand,\nwith a little a bit of help, with a GPU\n\n301\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.800\nthat’s built into the processor,\nhow to do calculations on graphics.\n\n302\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.836\nWhich is kind of interesting,\nbecause remember, we've mentioned in other\n\n303\n00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:00.325\nepisodes that fact that a CPU works\non sequential streams of data.\n\n304\n00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:05.382\nA GPU does parallel computing, right,\nparallelism, if I can say that right.\n\n305\n00:15:05.382 --> 00:15:07.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where it can take a single piece of\n\n306\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.785\ngraphic, and do five different\nthings to it at one time, right?\n\n307\n00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.890\nWell, imagine not having to send that\ninformation out on an external bus into\n\n308\n00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.390\nthe graphics card, wait for the graphics\ncard to perform whatever its function is.\n\n309\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.727\nAnd then receive that information back,\nif we can pack it right there in the CPU\n\n310\n00:15:23.727 --> 00:15:26.631\nitself, so\nyou might hear integrated GPUs as well.\n\n311\n00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:30.794\nNow, getting back to the caching type,\nall right?\n\n312\n00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:34.375\nWe talked about L1 cache,\nL1 cache is the most frequently-used,\n\n313\n00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:36.548\ninstructions are gonna be stored there.\n\n314\n00:15:36.548 --> 00:15:41.293\nAnd then it's prioritized, L2,\nit's tiered, if you will, and\n\n315\n00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:45.135\nthen L3,\nL2 cache has less frequent instructions.\n\n316\n00:15:45.135 --> 00:15:50.688\nNow, L3 can also be a bank of memory,\nthat could be on the motherboard itself.\n\n317\n00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:57.444\nAgain, L1 and L2 are typically\nintegrated into the CPUs themselves.\n\n318\n00:15:57.444 --> 00:16:00.775\nNow the other thing that they\ncall it is hyperthreading.\n\n319\n00:16:00.775 --> 00:16:05.600\nNow hyperthreading is Intel's form of\nsomething known as multithreading.\n\n320\n00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.033\nIt's been around for a very long time.\n\n321\n00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:12.440\nThe IBM mainframes have been doing\nit since the late 60s and 70s.\n\n322\n00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.905\nBut remember what I told you, I said that\nprocessors work on sequential streams of\n\n323\n00:16:16.905 --> 00:16:19.115\ndata, they're called threads right.\n\n324\n00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:23.758\nThe fact that we have, for instance,\nmultiple processing units if I could only\n\n325\n00:16:23.758 --> 00:16:27.014\nfeed one stream of information\ninto that CPU at a time and\n\n326\n00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:31.866\nit's not efficient why should we have\nsix other cores, eight cores, 16 cores,\n\n327\n00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.216\n32 cores, if you will,\nsitting there doing nothing?\n\n328\n00:16:35.216 --> 00:16:40.173\nSo what we can do, if you will, is we\ncan put in multiple streams of data into\n\n329\n00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:43.821\nthe same CPU, and\nthat's called hyper-threading.\n\n330\n00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:48.950\nNow, hyper-threading is kind of\na numbers game, if you will.\n\n331\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.085\nIt's back to more numbers games.\n\n332\n00:16:51.085 --> 00:16:56.680\nHyper-threading is interesting because\nthe fact that the registers, the little,\n\n333\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.300\nlittle, smallest pieces of storage unit\nwithin a computer's called a register.\n\n334\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.630\nIt stores one bit of data and\nit's located in the CPU.\n\n335\n00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.380\nThey started to learn that\nbecause processors are so\n\n336\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.540\nfast, those registers\nweren't always getting used.\n\n337\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.110\nSo what they found is a way in software\nthat they can logically divide it up,\n\n338\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:14.754\nand if the operating supports it,\n\n339\n00:17:14.754 --> 00:17:18.512\nwhich most of your operating systems have\nsupported this for a very long time.\n\n340\n00:17:18.512 --> 00:17:21.607\nThey could see it as more\nthan one physical core.\n\n341\n00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:26.793\nAnd understand that you can have four\nphysical cores on the chip but you could\n\n342\n00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:32.000\nfeed in eight individual threads,\nall right and that's hyper threading.\n\n343\n00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.819\nAgain, it's a multithreading\ntechnology that\n\n344\n00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:39.571\nallows you to put more than one stream of\ninformation into the CPU at the same time.\n\n345\n00:17:39.571 --> 00:17:43.030\nNow sometimes it benefits you,\nsometimes they say it doesn't.\n\n346\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.507\nAgain, we're not here to debate that\nbecause we can go down that path and\n\n347\n00:17:46.507 --> 00:17:47.544\nbe here a whole week.\n\n348\n00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:52.301\nBut just remember, hyperthreading means\nI can put more than one stream of\n\n349\n00:17:52.301 --> 00:17:56.675\ninformation into the CPU at once and\nthe operating system will see,\n\n350\n00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:00.300\nlet's say four physical cores\nas eight logical cores.\n\n351\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.901\nAgain, the difference between the physical\nis the actual hardware on the chip itself.\n\n352\n00:18:04.901 --> 00:18:07.910\nLogical means it's represented\ninside of software.\n\n353\n00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, where would we see\nthis hyperthreading business?\n\n354\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.117\nWhere is it employed?\n\n355\n00:18:13.117 --> 00:18:16.350\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit primarily Intel based chips, right?\n\n356\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.486\nIf you go into your\nTask Manager inside of Windows,\n\n357\n00:18:18.486 --> 00:18:20.931\ntypically you can bring up\nthings like your Task Manager.\n\n358\n00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:25.703\nYou bring up your Task Manager, you might\nsee that you have four cores, right,\n\n359\n00:18:25.703 --> 00:18:30.264\nindividual threads but what you'll\nnotice inside of Task Manager as well is\n\n360\n00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:33.700\nyou'll see that it represents\nit as 8 logical cores.\n\n361\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.490\nAnd then you say well, Dan,\nI know I just bought a 4-core processor.\n\n362\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.323\nI just bought it, it said quad core.\n\n363\n00:18:39.323 --> 00:18:44.261\nBut when I look inside of the operating\nsystem I actually see 8 individual meters\n\n364\n00:18:44.261 --> 00:18:45.070\nif you will.\n\n365\n00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.300\nAnd that's typically where you see, you\nsee an inside of Intel-based processors.\n\n366\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.120\nNow, the other thing that we have\nto also talk about is, that with\n\n367\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.070\nmodern processors today,\nwe also have the ability provided that\n\n368\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:05.790\nthe processor supports it,\nwhat's known as virtualization.\n\n369\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.790\nNow, virtualization is\na very cool technology,\n\n370\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.760\nanother one that's been around for\na very long time.\n\n371\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.560\nBut it's typically, I would say, within\nthe past ten years, or prior to that,\n\n372\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.640\nit was typically something you would\nsee in the enterprise environments.\n\n373\n00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.820\nHowever it's become more and\n\n374\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.940\nmore common in just about every CPU\nthat you have inside a desktop PC today.\n\n375\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.313\nWhether it be Intel or AMD,\nsupports the ability to run\n\n376\n00:19:27.313 --> 00:19:31.696\nmore than one operating\nsystem on a physical machine.\n\n377\n00:19:31.696 --> 00:19:32.670\nAnd that's a great thing.\n\n378\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.860\nAnd that's essentially\nwhat virtualization does.\n\n379\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.590\nIt means that I can have more than one\noperating system controlling the hardware\n\n380\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.730\nat any given time.\n\n381\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:45.011\nNow be careful because what we aren't\ntalking about is what is called dual-boot.\n\n382\n00:19:45.011 --> 00:19:49.630\nDual-boot when we talk about a dual-boot\nsituation you boot one operating system\n\n383\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.460\nand it takes over the hardware and\n\n384\n00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.500\nthen when I wanna run the other operating\nsystem I have to shut the first one down.\n\n385\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.468\nAnd then I boot strapped\nthe second operating system.\n\n386\n00:19:59.468 --> 00:20:03.928\nWhen we talk about virtualization here\nwhat we are talking about is the ability\n\n387\n00:20:03.928 --> 00:20:08.744\nto run multiple isolated instances of an\noperating system on one physical machine.\n\n388\n00:20:08.744 --> 00:20:13.510\nAnd that is a very very handy thing\nto have in today's day and age.\n\n389\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.670\nIf you're talking about PC then we're\ntalking about the ability to run\n\n390\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.290\ntesting if you will.\n\n391\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.870\nWithout having to have multiple machines\nI can take one physical machine,\n\n392\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.880\nmore than one operating system very,\nvery good for testing.\n\n393\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.147\nIt also means that we could save space in\nour server closet if we're talking about\n\n394\n00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:35.880\nthings like enterprise level environments\nwhere you have a single physical computer,\n\n395\n00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.281\nand you're running 4 or 5, 10,\n\n396\n00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:43.171\n15 logical computers if you will in\na single device so very, very handy.\n\n397\n00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:45.244\nAll right, what else do we got here too?\n\n398\n00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.251\n32 bit versus 64 bit.\n\n399\n00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:53.486\nNow when we talk about 32 bit\narchitecture versus 64 bit architecture,\n\n400\n00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:57.230\nthis is based on\nthe capabilities of the CPU.\n\n401\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.885\nWhen it comes down to it,\n32 bit architecture and\n\n402\n00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:04.208\n64 bit architecture have to deal with not\nonly the fact that the CPU supports it but\n\n403\n00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:06.584\nreally how much memory\nthe CPU can work with.\n\n404\n00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:09.839\nRight, in a 32 bit operating system,\nyou're typically,\n\n405\n00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.650\nyou are restricted to four gigs.\n\n406\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:18.160\nAnd in a 64 bit operating system there's I\ndon't wanna say that you aren't limited.\n\n407\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.110\nBut the limit is so astronomically large\nthat we don't really have home PCs or\n\n408\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.630\ndesktops, laptops,\nif you will, it support.\n\n409\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.720\nI think it's something like,\n\n410\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.230\nI heard it one time it just like\n16 exabytes of memory, right?\n\n411\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.419\nIt just means we get past that\nfour gigabyte limitation.\n\n412\n00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:39.540\nAnd that is something that's important\nto keep in mind is architecture.\n\n413\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.480\nIt means that if you have a 32-bit CPU and\n\n414\n00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.800\na 32-bit piece of hardware,\nyou have to run a 32-bit operating system.\n\n415\n00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.442\nYou cannot run a 64-bit operating system.\n\n416\n00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:54.049\nNow, the interesting thing\nthough is if you have a 64-bit\n\n417\n00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:58.850\noperating system,\nyes you can run obviously a 64-bit CPU.\n\n418\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.026\nYes, you can run a 64-bit\noperating system, but\n\n419\n00:22:01.026 --> 00:22:02.617\nhere's what's kinda interesting.\n\n420\n00:22:02.617 --> 00:22:05.522\nYou can actually run a 32-bit\noperating system too.\n\n421\n00:22:05.522 --> 00:22:08.709\nIt's not recommended because what you do\nis you basically reduce the amount of\n\n422\n00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:09.900\nmemory that you can see.\n\n423\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.263\nSo kind of as a recap, I want you to\nremember that if you have a 32-bit\n\n424\n00:22:13.263 --> 00:22:15.439\noperating system,\nyou have to or excuse me.\n\n425\n00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:21.643\nI keep saying that, 32-bit CPU You\nhave to run a 32-bit operating system.\n\n426\n00:22:21.643 --> 00:22:26.035\nIf you have a 64-bit CPU,\nyou can run a 64-bit operating system and\n\n427\n00:22:26.035 --> 00:22:28.420\nhave access to a lot of memory, right.\n\n428\n00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.647\nThere really isn't much of a limitation\ninside of our home PCs today or\n\n429\n00:22:32.647 --> 00:22:37.610\nreally even in our servers today,\noutside of the manufacturers' limitations.\n\n430\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:42.210\nBut you could also run\na 32-bit operating system.\n\n431\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.912\nAgain, when you do that it's not wise\nbecause of the fact that when you run that\n\n432\n00:22:46.912 --> 00:22:51.618\n32-bit operating system on a 64-bit\nplatform you basically restricted\n\n433\n00:22:51.618 --> 00:22:55.194\nyourself back to 4 gigs, so\ndefinitely not recommended.\n\n434\n00:22:55.194 --> 00:22:59.316\nOne of the last things I wanna talk about\nwhen it comes to the characteristics of\n\n435\n00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:02.700\nthe CPU is something they call\nthe execution bit or execute bit.\n\n436\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.490\nAnd this is called a couple of\ndifferent things depending on what\n\n437\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.700\ntechnology you're looking at.\n\n438\n00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.223\nYou might hear Windows and\ntheir operating systems,\n\n439\n00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:12.373\nthey call it something known as DEP,\ndata execution protection.\n\n440\n00:23:12.373 --> 00:23:17.150\nAs far as the hardware goes you might\nhear it called NX and that's no execute.\n\n441\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.169\nAnd no execute basically allows for\n\n442\n00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:22.271\na portion of memory to be\nflagged as non-executable.\n\n443\n00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:26.997\nAnd that means that if data goes into\nthat location it cannot be executed\n\n444\n00:23:26.997 --> 00:23:28.820\nfrom those regions.\n\n445\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.272\nThese features are basically supported in\n\n446\n00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:38.349\nwhat's known as x86 and x64 technologies.\n\n447\n00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:40.180\nThat's probably another\nthing that I wanna mention.\n\n448\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.943\nI was gonna save that for the operating\nsystem section, but we might as well talk\n\n449\n00:23:43.943 --> 00:23:47.274\nabout it here just briefly when we\ntalk about 32 bit versus 64 bit.\n\n450\n00:23:47.274 --> 00:23:51.988\nYou might hear terms like x86,\na lot of times x86 is a common term for\n\n451\n00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:54.130\n32-bit computing.\n\n452\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:59.024\nx64 is common term for 64-bit computing.\n\n453\n00:23:59.024 --> 00:24:03.471\nBut you might hear some other kinda terms\nthat kinda get a little bit confusing.\n\n454\n00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:05.362\nAMD64, guess what?\n\n455\n00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:09.680\nThat's also 64 bit computing so I want\nyou to kinda know those terms as well.\n\n456\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:15.245\nx86 for 32 bit, x64 and\nAMD64 for 64 bit computers.\n\n457\n00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:20.678\n&gt;&gt; And also,\nsometimes I've seen x86 under score 64.\n\n458\n00:24:20.678 --> 00:24:22.013\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely-\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n459\n00:24:22.013 --> 00:24:25.482\ndefinitely 64 bit-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and what happens there it's kind\n\n460\n00:24:25.482 --> 00:24:30.188\ninteresting so and l know you're a ware\nof this, so let's go back to the old\n\n461\n00:24:30.188 --> 00:24:35.200\n880 six process like very early on\nWhen everything was 16 and 32-bit.\n\n462\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.127\nAnd x86 is a CPU instruction set and\nthat instruction set,\n\n463\n00:24:39.127 --> 00:24:41.058\nthey said well you know what?\n\n464\n00:24:41.058 --> 00:24:44.270\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna add additional instructions.\n\n465\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.430\nThink about it as a you\ntake your language.\n\n466\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.612\nI don't care where you're from.\n\n467\n00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:50.430\nWe're in the States here\nwe're speaking English.\n\n468\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.986\nWell, I speak bad English.\n\n469\n00:24:51.986 --> 00:24:53.242\nBut we're speaking English here, right?\n\n470\n00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:54.324\n&gt;&gt; I speak badder English than you.\n\n471\n00:24:54.324 --> 00:24:56.214\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n472\n00:24:56.214 --> 00:24:58.173\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and x86, they said, well,\n\n473\n00:24:58.173 --> 00:25:01.871\nwe already got the instruction set\nlet's add the instructions right.\n\n474\n00:25:01.871 --> 00:25:08.440\nThe extra instructions to support\n64 bits so that's what you hear.\n\n475\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.100\nIt's an extension of\nthe earlier x86 architecture.\n\n476\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.700\nSo I'm glad you mention that x86-64,\nit just means that\n\n477\n00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:20.310\nthey took the original 8086\narchitecture and said, let's extend it.\n\n478\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.250\nLet's extend it to 64-bit computing.\n\n479\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.990\nSo, a lot of different confusing\nterms we realize that out there.\n\n480\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.960\nAgain, really for the exam just know\nthe basis of why you would use 32-bit or\n\n481\n00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.710\nwhy you would use 64-bit over 32-bit\nis really the memory limitations.\n\n482\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.255\nNow I know we've got a lot more to talk\nabout but Dan is over here looking at me\n\n483\n00:25:38.255 --> 00:25:40.974\nand I think I've talked a little\nbit too much on this one.\n\n484\n00:25:40.974 --> 00:25:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're definitely running\nout of time for this episode.\n\n485\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.826\nSo we're gonna have to well do\none of our famous part twos.\n\n486\n00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:49.274\nWes we do thank you for getting us this\nfar, we'll look forward to seeing where\n\n487\n00:25:49.274 --> 00:25:52.630\nelse you gonna take us down this wonderful\nlittle CPU road you've got us on.\n\n488\n00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.830\nThat being said we do thank you guys for\nwatching.\n\n489\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.710\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n490\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.002\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n491\n00:26:00.002 --> 00:26:06.697\n[MUSIC]\n\n492\n00:26:06.697 --> 00:26:09.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

you\n\n3\n00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:03.109\nlive from San Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:06.449\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:08.294\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.828\nYou're watching IT PRO TV.\n\n7\n00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:13.379\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n8\n00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.920\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT PRO TV.\n\n9\n00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.651\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode well, it's more on our A+.\n\n10\n00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:24.470\nWhat is it?\nThe 220-901 if I'm not mistaken.\n\n11\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.010\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\nfor more on CPUs and cooling solutions,\n\n12\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.620\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.110\nWes, glad to have you,\nmy man, how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.745\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, it's going great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:35.215\nThat's right, part two on CPUs,\n\n16\n00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.785\nbecause, well, I talk a lot\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:38.319\n&gt;&gt; In the first part.\n\n18\n00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:39.139\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot to talk about.\n\n19\n00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.673\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n20\n00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.005\nthere's a lot of different characteristics\nthat we have to talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:43.195\nLet's just take a real quick second.\n\n22\n00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:45.715\nAnd recap some of the things we've talked\nabout in the first part when it comes to\n\n23\n00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.380\nthe characteristics of the CPU.\n\n24\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.820\nRemember, one of the things that\nwe did mention is speed, right?\n\n25\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.440\nWhen we talk about clock speed,\nif you will,\n\n26\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.500\nit's how many calculations can\na CPU form in a given second.\n\n27\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.538\nAnd it is measured in hertz, remember\nif you have a 2.8 gigahertz processor,\n\n28\n00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:04.920\nlike Dan mentioned in the first part.\n\n29\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.618\nThat's 2.8 billion calculations in a given\nsecond, which is absolutely crazy and\n\n30\n00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:10.680\nmind-boggling.\n\n31\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.844\nWe also talked about\nmulti-core processing.\n\n32\n00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:15.925\nMulti-core processors are because\nof the fact that processors have\n\n33\n00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.221\ngotten smaller and smaller and\nsmaller over time.\n\n34\n00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:22.916\nSo they found a way that they could put\nmore than just one processing unit in\n\n35\n00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.180\nthe center of that little\ngreen wafer that you see.\n\n36\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.420\nThat is known as our CPU.\n\n37\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.160\nWe also talked about the caching system.\n\n38\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.670\nRemember, because the CPU is so darn fast,\nfaster than anything on the CPU.\n\n39\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.710\nIf we have a common set of instructions\nthat the CPU is always calculating.\n\n40\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.625\nWe put those in a non-volatile\nregion of memory called cache.\n\n41\n00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.650\nI don't know if I mentioned this,\nbut let me go ahead and mention it.\n\n42\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.692\nIt's called SRAM,\nthat's static random-access memory.\n\n43\n00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:54.177\nSo when the power's lost those\ninstructions do stay behind for\n\n44\n00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:55.480\na period of time.\n\n45\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.307\nRemember it's a hierarchy, L1, L2, L3.\n\n46\n00:01:57.307 --> 00:01:59.968\nMost common instructions in L1, and\n\n47\n00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:05.230\nthen it prioritizes the lower\npriority instructions in L2 and L3.\n\n48\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.630\nBoth L1 and L2 are inside of the CPU,\nmost likely today.\n\n49\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.350\nYou even have portions of the motherboard\nthat might have a dedicated\n\n50\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.740\nSRAM bank called L3 cache.\n\n51\n00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.100\nWe also talked about hyper-threading.\n\n52\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.468\nRemember, hyper-threading is a way to\nfeed more than one sequential stream of\n\n53\n00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:23.324\ninformation.\n\n54\n00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:25.872\nBasically allowing, for instance,\n\n55\n00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:30.380\ntwo applications to have their\ndata processed at the same time.\n\n56\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.350\nWe also mentioned things\nlike virtualization.\n\n57\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.330\nThe ability for the CPU to have\nmore than one operating system\n\n58\n00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.430\nrunning in any single physical device.\n\n59\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.790\nSo all great things.\n\n60\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.740\nWe also talked about the architecture,\n32 bit versus 64 bit.\n\n61\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.298\nKeep in mind when we talk about 32 bit\nwe're talking about a limitation of 4\n\n62\n00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:48.965\ngigs of rams.\n\n63\n00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:51.732\n64 bit, we don't have that limitation.\n\n64\n00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:55.310\nAnd there were some other\nthings that we talked about.\n\n65\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.270\nBut those are some of the bigger things\nthat you definitely have to know.\n\n66\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.272\nIf that doesn't make sense then\njump back over and see part one.\n\n67\n00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:03.570\nAnd we'll see you here in a little bit.\n\n68\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.400\nNow what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna dive into well,\n\n69\n00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.940\nwhat do we use to keep those CPUs cool?\n\n70\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.190\nOne of the major concerns when it\ncomes to any kind of system unit is\n\n71\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.970\nproper thermal management.\n\n72\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.370\nAnd what we mean by thermal\nmanagement is the CPU,\n\n73\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.080\nwe have a lot of voltage\nbeing pumped into these CPUs.\n\n74\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.850\nDan, I've seen some boards that\nare the higher end Intel boards where they\n\n75\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.910\nhave a dedicated 600 watts,\njust to the CPU alone.\n\n76\n00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.380\nLet alone what else you got\ngoing on inside of your machine.\n\n77\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.120\nSo, they get very, very hot.\n\n78\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.750\nSo it is important that we are aware\nof the different components inside\n\n79\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.300\nof the system that help to\ndissipate some of that heat.\n\n80\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.740\nNow, things that we do talk about in other\nepisodes, I wanna just kinda mention here.\n\n81\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.590\nBecause although it's not expressly\ncalled out on the objectives,\n\n82\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.350\nyou should know as an IT tech.\n\n83\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.340\nInside of any kind of A+ situation and\non the exam.\n\n84\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.740\nRemember one of the first starting points\nof your cooling system is your case.\n\n85\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.862\nYou have strategically placed vents,\nif you will, in the ATX motherboards.\n\n86\n00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:06.990\nOne of the things that standard\ndid is it kind of reversed\n\n87\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.900\nthe way the circulation would be done.\n\n88\n00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.520\nWhat happens is it brings cool air in\ncombination with fans into the system.\n\n89\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.660\nAs the heat rises the fans exhaust,\n\n90\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.130\nif you will,\nthe heat out of the back of the case.\n\n91\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.200\nKeep in mind during normal operations\n\n92\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.380\nyour case within your system\nunit needs to stay closed.\n\n93\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.390\nBecause it is part of the cooling unit.\n\n94\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.070\nSo, I do wanna make mention of that.\n\n95\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.730\nIt's not, again,\nin the formal objectives here.\n\n96\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.180\nThere is one other thing that's\nnot in the objectives, here,\n\n97\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.360\neither when it comes to cooling,\nand that's also your power supply.\n\n98\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120\nThe other thing with the ATX motherboard,\n\n99\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.340\nthat standard that's been around\nsince 1995 when Intel released it.\n\n100\n00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.608\nIs it rotated the entire board and put the\nCPU directly under the power supply fan.\n\n101\n00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:51.180\nSo that the power supply fan\ncould help to assist the cooling.\n\n102\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.590\nSo, a couple of things,\n\n103\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.430\nlike I said, that aren't here in\nthe objectives that we're talking about.\n\n104\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.375\nBut a major part of your\noverall cooling system.\n\n105\n00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:02.490\nCuz, well, Dan you read off\nthe title here, Appropriate Cooling.\n\n106\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.530\nAnd it's not just about what's\nup with the objectives.\n\n107\n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.742\nSo that being said,\nlet's go ahead and talk about,\n\n108\n00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:11.808\nwhen it comes to the CPU itself,\none of our first,\n\n109\n00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:15.913\nif you will, primary components\nin this overall cooling system.\n\n110\n00:05:15.913 --> 00:05:19.270\nAnd that's something known as a heat sink.\n\n111\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.073\nAnd I've got a little bit\nof a diagram here and\n\n112\n00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:23.272\nwe'll actually look at a heat sink,\ntoo, coming up.\n\n113\n00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:28.810\nI can almost guarantee you, this is\nprobably a diagram of some AMD socket.\n\n114\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.770\nBecause of that zero insertion\nforce socket that we talked about.\n\n115\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.960\nThe little handle we showed you in\nthe motherboard when I opened it up.\n\n116\n00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.640\nIt kinda pulls the socket back and\n\n117\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.520\nreleases those pins that\nit's grabbing onto.\n\n118\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.140\nWell, notice this little piece,\nit almost looks like a radiator, right?\n\n119\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.090\nThis radiator is what's\nknown as the heat sink.\n\n120\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.420\nAnd what the heat sink is is really\nnothing more than a radiator that's\n\n121\n00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.350\na piece of metal, if you will.\n\n122\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.880\nAnd what it does is it actually,\nin theory,\n\n123\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.930\nit increases the surface\narea of the CPU drastically.\n\n124\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.150\nAnd that's because if you\nwould take a hammer, right?\n\n125\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.970\nAnd you were to mill this down\nto a flat piece of metal.\n\n126\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.290\nAnd I don't know what the percentage is,\n\n127\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.790\nI've heard it before I can't think\nof it at the top of my head.\n\n128\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.407\nThat it will be a big flat piece of\nmetal and that's what is supposed to do.\n\n129\n00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:13.960\nIt's supposed to increase\nthe surface area of the CPU.\n\n130\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.400\nNow the other thing that it does is it\nactually draws heat into these valleys\n\n131\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.590\nright here, into the valleys between it.\n\n132\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.537\nAnd what you'll see is that we have\nsomething on top of it known as\n\n133\n00:06:23.537 --> 00:06:24.145\nthe CPU fan.\n\n134\n00:06:24.145 --> 00:06:28.887\nAnd the CPU fan is responsible for\ntaking that air that's essentially\n\n135\n00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:33.370\nheated up within those valleys and\nit kind of dissipates it away.\n\n136\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.770\nBlows it out of the heat sink itself,\nso that it helps to assist the cooling.\n\n137\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.788\nNow, more specifically, when you have\na fan like this with a heat sink,\n\n138\n00:06:43.788 --> 00:06:47.259\nthat is what is known as\nan active cooling system.\n\n139\n00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.905\nYou also what are known as\npassive cooling systems.\n\n140\n00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:54.401\nAnd these passive cooling systems\nare found in things like your very,\n\n141\n00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.770\nvery small form factor motherboards.\n\n142\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.780\nLike the microATX, mini-ITX,\nPico-ITX boards that they have now.\n\n143\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.000\nAnd that's because they use\nvery low power CPUs, so\n\n144\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.690\nthey don't generate a lot of heat.\n\n145\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.531\nLow power CPUs don't\ngenerate a lot of heat,\n\n146\n00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:11.135\nwe can just put the heat sink on itself.\n\n147\n00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:15.720\nAnd it's doing its job passively,\nthat's a passive cooling system.\n\n148\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.450\nOr sometimes called fanless,\nif you will, really for obvious reasons.\n\n149\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.940\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's kinda look at this motherboard.\n\n150\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.149\nWe've got all different\nkinds of cooling units here.\n\n151\n00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:29.069\nAnd I was kinda joking around with Dan,\nI said,\n\n152\n00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:29.850\nlook at the size-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.380\n&gt;&gt; Of this heat sink, here.\n\n154\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.663\nTalk about [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You'll notice\n\n155\n00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:32.896\nit's the size of your hand.\n\n156\n00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:33.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n157\n00:07:33.454 --> 00:07:37.637\n[LAUGH] Dan suggested that I wear\nthis as a hat as big this sucker is.\n\n158\n00:07:37.637 --> 00:07:38.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably\n\n159\n00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:40.443\ncontact the mothership while I'm at it.\n\n160\n00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:41.012\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n161\n00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:42.525\n&gt;&gt; But notice the flat surface, here.\n\n162\n00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:46.786\nWell, I want you to understand, too, that\nthere are a couple of extra things that we\n\n163\n00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:49.078\nhave with the heat sink\nthat go along with it.\n\n164\n00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:51.403\nIt's not just the heat sink and\njust the fan.\n\n165\n00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:55.130\nBut you can see that it's kinda\nlike a heat exchange system.\n\n166\n00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.608\nSystem, right?\nWhere it pulls the heat away from the CPU.\n\n167\n00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:02.941\nAs the CPU heats up, it brings this\nhot air, or the heat, into itself,\n\n168\n00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:06.080\nand it dissipates it up\ninto the vents here.\n\n169\n00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.840\nAnd then, if we have a fan on place,\nI believe this fan,\n\n170\n00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.420\nif I remember right, was side mounted\nhere, and it would blow it out the side.\n\n171\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.250\nBut keep in mind, you also have\ntop-mounted fans like you see here too.\n\n172\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.467\nNow, if you're a little OCD,\nyou might notice something about this fan,\n\n173\n00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:21.550\nis it's kinda twisted.\n\n174\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.600\nI know one of our other host here\ndidn't like these, like man,\n\n175\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.070\nI need to be asymmetrical or\nsymmetry, that's right, symmetrical.\n\n176\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.046\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:29.046 --> 00:08:32.680\n&gt;&gt; And don't worry about that, because\nthis one here, if I was to lift this up\n\n178\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.090\njust a little bit, you'll see that this is\nactually more of like a cylinder, right?\n\n179\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.607\nBut the principle is the same.\n\n180\n00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:44.220\nAnd then what you have is you have a fan\nthat spins and it blows the hot air away.\n\n181\n00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.705\nKeep in mind that it's typically\nconnected to the motherboard, and\n\n182\n00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:51.310\nthat's something that you want\nbecause part of the chipset, really,\n\n183\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.673\nthe BIOS or the UA FI system,\nit can actually detect what the heat,\n\n184\n00:08:54.673 --> 00:08:58.580\nthe core temperature, core voltage,\ncore temperature of the CPU.\n\n185\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.780\nAnd as that heat rises,\nit can apply more voltage to this fan, and\n\n186\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.540\nit can increase the RPMs within the fan.\n\n187\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.100\nNow that's not the only thing we have,\ntoo.\n\n188\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.168\nRemember, I told you that the system\nunit also has system fans as well.\n\n189\n00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:14.494\nAnd we've got a few\ndifferent types back here,\n\n190\n00:09:14.494 --> 00:09:17.630\nyou can see that they are all\ndifferent shapes and sizes.\n\n191\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.122\nAnd I wanna talk real briefly about the\ndifferent shapes or sizes that we have.\n\n192\n00:09:22.122 --> 00:09:25.960\nBecause there's some different\ncharacteristics, and honestly ladies and\n\n193\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.100\ngents, I don't know how specific they're\ngonna be to the characteristics of a fan,\n\n194\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.210\nbut you should know this.\n\n195\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.020\nWe've kind of said throughout this\nseries that it's not just about\n\n196\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.920\nwhat's on the certification,\nobjectives as well.\n\n197\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.320\nBut it's about making you trained\nif you're gonna be an IT tech.\n\n198\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.060\nIt kind of gives you the information.\n\n199\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:47.140\nThis is what's known, if I remember right,\nthis is a 120 millimeter fan, I believe.\n\n200\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.300\nThey do have slightly bigger,\nthose not quite as common,\n\n201\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.430\nunless you're talking about a gaming\nrig and that's 240 millimeter fans.\n\n202\n00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.910\nThis is a common sized fan here,\nin fact 120 millimeters, you'll find\n\n203\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.480\na lot of cases that have brackets here\nthat already line up to this type of fan.\n\n204\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.165\nThis is typically the fan that's\ngonna be set on the front and\n\n205\n00:10:07.165 --> 00:10:08.580\non the rear of the case.\n\n206\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.020\nAnd again, you'll have to pay attention.\n\n207\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.150\nI don't know if this one has it on it.\n\n208\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.420\nUsually what you can see\non the top somewhere.\n\n209\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.116\nAnd yeah, I don't see it on this one.\n\n210\n00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:21.940\nYou'll have directions that\nshows you which way this spins.\n\n211\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.104\nAnd you've gotta keep in mind\nthat on the front of the case,\n\n212\n00:10:25.104 --> 00:10:27.590\ndue to the ATX standard,\nit’s an intake fan.\n\n213\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.140\nSo it draws cool air and as the heat\nrises, the rear fan is typically going\n\n214\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.010\nto exhaust fan, so it’s a pull push\nsystem, if I believe I said that right.\n\n215\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.590\nAnd this is also got the little four-pin,\nit's called a Molex KK connector.\n\n216\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.600\nAnd again,\nI don't know how specific they'll get.\n\n217\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.421\nBut just keep in mind that when you have\nthe fourth pin, what you do is you have\n\n218\n00:10:46.421 --> 00:10:50.723\nyour positive, you have your negative, you\nhave your ground, and then you also have\n\n219\n00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:55.245\na fourth pin that the BIOS can actually\ncontrol or the UEFI system can control.\n\n220\n00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:58.255\nDoing things like detecting\nthe RPMs in the fan.\n\n221\n00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:02.565\nIf it's a variable speed fan, it can\napply more voltage and raise the RPMs.\n\n222\n00:11:02.565 --> 00:11:06.100\nNow, remember that RPMs guys,\nwe're talking about no different than when\n\n223\n00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.860\nwe're talking about hard drives or\nanything else.\n\n224\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.790\nWe're talking revolutions per minute.\n\n225\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.190\nAnd that might be a contributing factor.\n\n226\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.930\nNot only the size of the fan, common\nsizes, here's another common system fan.\n\n227\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.740\nThat's an 80 millimeter fan,\n\n228\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.610\nyou usually see this on the side\nwalls of the towers too.\n\n229\n00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.821\nCould see two or three of them across\nthe top as well, as well as even a 120.\n\n230\n00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:26.442\nI've seen some gaming rigs\nthat are really expensive,\n\n231\n00:11:26.442 --> 00:11:30.080\nvery good fans that have three of these\nright along the top of the case as well.\n\n232\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.610\nAnd it's all relative too, to where\nthe power supply is positioned as well.\n\n233\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:41.060\nNow, they don't always have to follow a\nspecific standard because you'll see that,\n\n234\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.680\nyeah, see this one doesn't.\n\n235\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.559\nYou can see it's a slightly smaller, so to\ntell you the truth off the top of my head,\n\n236\n00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:49.290\nI want to say this is the one\nthat's 80 millimeter here.\n\n237\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.790\nAnd you can see that this is\na rotary DC brushless fan too.\n\n238\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.413\nThat's not so important,\nif you will, for the exam.\n\n239\n00:11:56.413 --> 00:11:58.650\nBut you also have bearings in there too.\n\n240\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.424\nSo the real takeaway from this,\n\n241\n00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:04.390\nI want you to know about these\nfans are a couple of things.\n\n242\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.687\nRPMs, the millimeters, again a 240, a 120,\n\n243\n00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:12.612\nand you have the 80\nmillimeter fans likewise.\n\n244\n00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:13.718\nRPMs, like I said.\n\n245\n00:12:13.718 --> 00:12:18.589\nAnd then theres another thing,\ncouple of other things believe it or\n\n246\n00:12:18.589 --> 00:12:24.320\nnot that are a factor when it comes to\nthe purchasing of fan, and those are CFMs.\n\n247\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.804\nThat's one of the first ones, and\nthat's the cubic feet per minute,\n\n248\n00:12:28.804 --> 00:12:31.870\nhow much air does the fan push, all right?\n\n249\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.760\nCuz Dan, I know I've built some\nrigs before where we have two\n\n250\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.610\n2100 RPM fans, and one CFMs is\na lot greater than the other one.\n\n251\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.750\nSo it means they're spinning at the same\nrate, they're both using the same\n\n252\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.650\namount of power, but\none of them can push more air per minute.\n\n253\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.170\nSo, that might be a contributing factor.\n\n254\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:57.576\nThe other thing that I would also keep\nin mind too, is decibels, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.380\nAnd you might say, well wait a second,\ndecibels, what do you mean?\n\n256\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.733\nWell, I know you've [CROSSTALK]\nI was gonna say, Dan,\n\n257\n00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:05.231\nhave you been in a server closet, tell us\na little bit about the deafening noise.\n\n258\n00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:08.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nAnytime you even open the door you're like\n\n259\n00:13:08.194 --> 00:13:09.480\nserver closet.\n\n260\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.531\nWhen we used to, we were looking for\nnetwork hardware or\n\n261\n00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:17.681\ncloset hardware and\nyou don't know what closet is it in?\n\n262\n00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:19.820\nWalk around, it's in this one.\n\n263\n00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.880\nBecause you hear those fans going crazy,\nbecause they have such a job to do,\n\n264\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.070\nthese things create so much heat that\nwe have to get that heat out of them.\n\n265\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.708\nAnd we do that a lot by\nusing fan technology and\n\n266\n00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:33.910\nthen just AC and\nthe mess out of whatever room it's in.\n\n267\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.612\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\nif you're building a rig or\n\n268\n00:13:35.612 --> 00:13:37.365\nservicing a rig where\nmaybe you're replacing it?\n\n269\n00:13:37.365 --> 00:13:42.417\nWell, imagine if you're in a datacenter\nlike Dan, I know Dan's worked in\n\n270\n00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:48.370\na large enterprise level business as well\nthat's had these, that's not bad, right?\n\n271\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.781\nYou have an isolated room, typically\nmight even have an entire datacenter for\n\n272\n00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:52.460\nyour servers.\n\n273\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.007\nImagine if that thing is sitting next to\ngrandma's work bench, not a work bench.\n\n274\n00:13:56.007 --> 00:13:57.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If she has a work bench well that's\n\n275\n00:13:57.579 --> 00:13:59.210\nreally great, which is awesome.\n\n276\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.919\nBut sitting next to a desk, right?\n\n277\n00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:01.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's not gonna like that.\n\n278\n00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:06.129\n&gt;&gt; You don't want it to sound like a Huey\ntaking off every time you turn the fan on\n\n279\n00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:07.870\nor turn the machine on.\n\n280\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.262\nI made a mistake when I built my first\ncomputer after becoming A+ certified.\n\n281\n00:14:12.262 --> 00:14:18.800\nI'm like, I need 4,000 RPM fans and\nI need them to spin as fast as they can.\n\n282\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.149\nWhen you turn the computer on,\nyou can't go to sleep at night.\n\n283\n00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:24.654\n&gt;&gt; It's a Harrier jump jet, it's crazy.\n\n284\n00:14:24.654 --> 00:14:26.960\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\npay attention to decibels too.\n\n285\n00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.022\nCuz again, if you're working with\na system that you're building\n\n286\n00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:33.578\nthat does voice recognition the fans\nthemselves can interfere with the voice\n\n287\n00:14:33.578 --> 00:14:34.630\nrecognition system.\n\n288\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.202\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n289\n00:14:38.202 --> 00:14:43.284\nAll right, so that's a few things that I\nwant you to keep in mind when it comes to\n\n290\n00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:49.140\nthe fans, millimeters, again, 240,\n120, 80 millimeters are common.\n\n291\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.690\nWhen you talk about small form factor\ndevices, I've seen some fans, Dan,\n\n292\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.532\nthey're crazy.\n\n293\n00:14:53.532 --> 00:14:55.100\nThey're 30 millimeter,\nthe size of a quarter.\n\n294\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.739\nBut now we're talking things like Internet\nof things, IoT-based type devices and\n\n295\n00:14:59.739 --> 00:15:03.220\nI don't really think they're\ngonna call that out on the exam.\n\n296\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.411\nCFMs, cubic feet per minute, keep in mind,\nwe had a great comment inside\n\n297\n00:15:08.411 --> 00:15:13.730\nof our chatroom that said,\nyou need the right, appropriate push-pull.\n\n298\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.550\nYou need a good ratio because if\nyou pull a lot of cool air in,\n\n299\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.370\nwhat's happening to that cool air,\nit's heating up, righ?\n\n300\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.500\nBut if your exhaust fan can't push\nthe hot air out the back of the case,\n\n301\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.556\nwell guess what?\n\n302\n00:15:26.556 --> 00:15:31.439\nYou're gonna run into thermal management\nissues that could cause just irreversible\n\n303\n00:15:31.439 --> 00:15:36.230\ndamage, because when it comes to thermal\ndamage within a CPU, you can't see it.\n\n304\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.578\nVery rarely, unless your CPU goes\nup in flames and you smell it,\n\n305\n00:15:39.578 --> 00:15:43.681\nthen obviously you could see it, so\nit could start to cause erratic behavior.\n\n306\n00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:48.373\nAnd another thing that you have to keep in\nmind is that manufactures don't like to\n\n307\n00:15:48.373 --> 00:15:51.823\nrefund money for\nproducts that you didn't take the time and\n\n308\n00:15:51.823 --> 00:15:54.680\nthe concern to be very delicate with them.\n\n309\n00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.341\nAnd understand what was going on,\nand again, sound too.\n\n310\n00:15:57.341 --> 00:15:59.340\nSound is another thing.\n\n311\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.370\nAll right, now,\nI did mention that we have fans, right?\n\n312\n00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.070\nAnd we have our heat sink.\n\n313\n00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.110\nWell, here's another thing in\ncombination with the heat sink.\n\n314\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.900\nIf we can go back to our big,\nold, massive,\n\n315\n00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.700\ncrazy heat sink that we've got right here.\n\n316\n00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.310\nNotice that we have this surface,\nand I'm not using this.\n\n317\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.660\nThis should be cleaned off, guys.\n\n318\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.420\nYou certainly don't\n\n319\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.380\nwant this looking like it does right\nhere with my fingerprints on it.\n\n320\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.770\nBut what we can't see, and\n\n321\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.920\nwe won't be able to see much if I keep\nblinding you guys there, is the fact,\n\n322\n00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.580\nthe bottom of that heat sink, it isn't\nas flat as we think it is, all right.\n\n323\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.600\nIt actually kind of looks like\nthe surface of a golf ball,\n\n324\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.420\nor milling marks on it, scratches on it.\n\n325\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.940\nAnd that's the same thing\nwith the top of a CPU.\n\n326\n00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.390\nAnd if we were to put that heat sink\nby itself down on the top of that CPU,\n\n327\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.270\nthen what we would have\nis actually an insulator.\n\n328\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.030\nThe problem is,\n\n329\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:54.540\nyou need something that bridges the gap,\nthe air gap in between metal on metal.\n\n330\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.600\nAnd also helps to kind of\nsmooth out those imperfections.\n\n331\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.620\nAnd that's something that has\nquite a few different names.\n\n332\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.160\nCommonly we just call it thermal paste or\nthermal compound.\n\n333\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.290\nI know I've heard people call it\nthermal goo, thermal putty, right?\n\n334\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.820\nAll different kinds of things.\n\n335\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.610\nBut when you're putting, and\nlet me show you here guys.\n\n336\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.090\nSo I got another heat\nsink here on the diagram.\n\n337\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:18.540\nAnd you'll see that again we've\ngot this surface right here.\n\n338\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.980\nAnd this technician right here is putting\nthat thermal compound, in this case,\n\n339\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.410\nputting in a little rice size that will\ndo you by the way on top of the CPU but\n\n340\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.055\nyou also put it over here on the heat\nsink and this is a laptop one.\n\n341\n00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:35.080\nSo that thermal paste, if you will, that\nthermal compound sits in between the heat\n\n342\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.575\nsink, and the CPU and it bridges that gap.\n\n343\n00:17:37.575 --> 00:17:39.655\nThe imperfections, the milling marks.\n\n344\n00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:45.880\nAnd what it does, it helps to dissipate\nto pull that hot air from that CPU and\n\n345\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:52.250\nhelps the transfer of the essentially\nthe heat into the heat sink as well.\n\n346\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.300\nSo do also know that.\n\n347\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.298\nNow there's a couple of different kinds\nof, well there's all different kinds of\n\n348\n00:17:56.298 --> 00:17:59.349\nmanufacturer, but primarily there's two\ndifferent kinds of thermal compound.\n\n349\n00:17:59.349 --> 00:18:01.033\nBoth of them work just fine.\n\n350\n00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:04.860\nSome people swear by some,\nsome people dont care.\n\n351\n00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.239\nThere is basic silicone based\nthermal compound and great,\n\n352\n00:18:09.239 --> 00:18:11.082\ndoes what it needs to do.\n\n353\n00:18:11.082 --> 00:18:14.736\nIn fact, when I've done warranty work and\nI've had to replace motherboards and\n\n354\n00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:18.389\nCPU's, that's what they give is a little\nbasic tube of that like you've seen in\n\n355\n00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:19.560\nthe picture that we had.\n\n356\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.140\nThere's also some that have\na lot of metal in them.\n\n357\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.890\nFor instance, Arctic Silver is one\nof the best type manufacturers and\n\n358\n00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.280\nwe're not getting any money for\nsaying Arctic Silver is one of the best.\n\n359\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.270\nIt just literally is.\n\n360\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.460\nIt's got a name for itself.\n\n361\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.180\n&gt;&gt; That's a fact.\n\n362\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.290\n&gt;&gt; And that's right.\n\n363\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.760\nYou can't argue with the facts.\n\n364\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.030\nIf you think about it,\nwhat's a good conductor of heat?\n\n365\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.985\nMetal, right, and\nthat's why we're using heat sinks.\n\n366\n00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:44.416\nWell Arctic Silver,\nit has a metal compound in it, so\n\n367\n00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:49.604\nit helps to accelerate the dissipation of\nthat heat from the CPU to its heat sink,\n\n368\n00:18:49.604 --> 00:18:51.230\nso you can also see that.\n\n369\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.249\nNow, there are a couple of considerations,\nright.\n\n370\n00:18:53.249 --> 00:18:58.233\nIf you're using a silicon base type\nthermal compound, be careful, getting\n\n371\n00:18:58.233 --> 00:19:02.986\nit down on to the motherboard or anywhere\nother than on the top of the CPU and\n\n372\n00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:08.180\nthe bottom of the heat sink because\nit is a nightmare to try to clean up.\n\n373\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.990\nIf you have a metal type based\nthermal compound, be careful.\n\n374\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.760\nWhy?\n\n375\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.610\nBecause not only is metal\na very good conductor of heat,\n\n376\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.130\nwhat else is it a good conductor of?\n\n377\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.340\n&gt;&gt; Electricity.\n\n378\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.000\n&gt;&gt; Electricity, that is right.\n\n379\n00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.030\nYou could electrically arc, short circuit\npieces and again these manufacturers\n\n380\n00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:33.400\nof these CPUs, they work in microns, they\ncan tell what's going on with their CPUs,\n\n381\n00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.250\nyou're not gonna fool them when they\nsay I don't know what happened.\n\n382\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.970\nThat was a problem with\nyour manufacturing.\n\n383\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.150\nThey can see those wafers in there.\n\n384\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.830\nAnd you might run into problems with\na warranty if you don't do this right or\n\n385\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.690\nappropriately and end up\nshort-circuiting your board out there.\n\n386\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.400\nAll right Dan, so\nwe've talked a lot about then theory.\n\n387\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; In the first part.\n\n388\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.440\nWe have just a little bit more that isn't\nquite so fun and just like any A plus.\n\n389\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.700\nWe wouldn't be doing you any justice if we\ndidn't have a bunch of specifications that\n\n390\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.590\nwe need you to know.\n\n391\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.980\nNow, Dan and I, I know Dan, when you're\ngonna get a CPU, how do you pick a CPU?\n\n392\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.600\nLet's say if I bring you in a case and\nyou need to replace it.\n\n393\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.430\n&gt;&gt; I look at the motherboard,\nI go to Google,\n\n394\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.390\nI type in motherboard name plus CPU and\na bunch of results come in.\n\n395\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.200\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's exactly how you should do it, okay?\n\n396\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.790\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n397\n00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.970\nThat's absolutely how you do it.\n\n398\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:25.880\nYou got a motherboard?\n\n399\n00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.080\nWhat does it say the CPU is?\n\n400\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.230\nWhat is the socket?\n\n401\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.690\nI go out and I find the CPU, and\nI find the socket that matches it, right?\n\n402\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.520\nFor that motherboard, okay?\n\n403\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.760\nThat's how you do it when\nyou're working in the field.\n\n404\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.290\nHowever, remember,\njust like any other profession,\n\n405\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.920\nyou're learning a new language, and\nCompTIA wants you to know a few\n\n406\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.520\nspecifics when it comes to the different\nsocket types that are out there.\n\n407\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.610\nSo I'd like to take just a few minutes,\nand yes, I know guys, it is not fun.\n\n408\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.520\nIt isn't fun, excuse me,\ntry a little better English there.\n\n409\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.710\nIt isn't fun, but you do have to know\nsome of these things for the exam.\n\n410\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.790\n&gt;&gt; So whip out the flashcards and\nget ready to write.\n\n411\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.673\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n412\n00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are going down memory lane.\n\n413\n00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.210\nAnd I do mean lots of memorization here.\n\n414\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.550\nSo, I've got a handful of these different\nprocessors, got a little diagram here and\n\n415\n00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.720\nyou'll see that they are Intel-based and\nthere are AMD-based.\n\n416\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.820\nWe'll go ahead and we're gonna start with\nthis Intel side, and we're gonna work our\n\n417\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.970\nway through this list here, and\nI just wanna talk briefly about each one.\n\n418\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.020\nI don't know how specific,\nguys, on the exam,\n\n419\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.030\nI can't tell you that they're gonna get.\n\n420\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.890\nBut the 775, all right,\nthat's also known as a socket team.\n\n421\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.980\nSometimes they have a couple of names and\n\n422\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.690\nthese CPU's were primarily for\nthings like your Pentium 4 processors.\n\n423\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:39.100\nThey were for Celeron and\nyour Core II Duos as well as Xeon.\n\n424\n00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.750\nThe next one is the 1155,\nalso known as Socket H2.\n\n425\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.850\nWhen we talked about that, we're talking\nabout Intel architectures as well,\n\n426\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.090\nall these are Intel, and that's\nthe Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Xeon.\n\n427\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.350\nLet me take a second and\n\n428\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.080\nlet you guys know because we really\nonly mentioned Xeon briefly.\n\n429\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.650\nXeon is your enterprise level\nserver grade 64 bit processors,\n\n430\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.270\nagain you find them in enterprise class.\n\n431\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:08.700\nAnd the Xeons are what are known\nas multiprocessor support.\n\n432\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.996\nI don't even know how many, you have\nlike 16 CPUs on a single board, right?\n\n433\n00:22:13.996 --> 00:22:17.073\nSo they sport multi-processor and\nthey're also multi-core.\n\n434\n00:22:17.073 --> 00:22:18.617\nSo boy, doesn't get that twisty, right?\n\n435\n00:22:18.617 --> 00:22:20.254\nMulti-processor, multi-core.\n\n436\n00:22:20.254 --> 00:22:22.297\nThat's the 1155.\n\n437\n00:22:22.297 --> 00:22:25.977\nThe 1156, this is the socket H and\n\n438\n00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:31.619\nagain these CPU's are the I series,\ni3, i5, and i7.\n\n439\n00:22:31.619 --> 00:22:34.370\nThey also support the Pentium.\n\n440\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.820\nCeleron and Xeon, all right?\n\n441\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.600\nA couple more guys, and like I said,\nI know these aren't fun, so\n\n442\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.082\njust bear with me on this one guys.\n\n443\n00:22:41.082 --> 00:22:45.714\nWe've got also the 1366,\nalso known as socket B.\n\n444\n00:22:45.714 --> 00:22:51.420\nThese were also for the i7 series,\nif you will, as well as Xeon.\n\n445\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.222\nSo the 1366 is kinda like one of the first\nbig boy processors, that it says, hey,\n\n446\n00:22:56.222 --> 00:23:00.360\nwe're gonna support the top of the line\nIntel based processors, again,\n\n447\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.181\ni7 and Xeon.\n\n448\n00:23:01.181 --> 00:23:05.450\nThen we have the 1150,\ncommonly also called socket H3.\n\n449\n00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.840\nThat fits what's known as Intel's Haswell,\n\n450\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.710\nas well as Intel's Broadwell based\narchitecture, or family, if you will.\n\n451\n00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.408\nLast one in the list,\non the Intel side, guys, and\n\n452\n00:23:18.408 --> 00:23:22.795\nwe'll move over to AMD as the,\nor excuse me, the 2011.\n\n453\n00:23:22.795 --> 00:23:26.984\nBy the way, on a side note, 2011 was one\nof the ones where the boards were the quad\n\n454\n00:23:26.984 --> 00:23:30.990\nchannel architecture, so we are talking\nsome pretty beefy set up here.\n\n455\n00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.850\nThese CPUs again higher end,\nit was a placement of the earlier 1150 for\n\n456\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:39.905\nthe i7 as well as the Xeon\nbased processors.\n\n457\n00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:42.815\nAll right, so that's our Intel side,\nwe also have our AMD side.\n\n458\n00:23:42.815 --> 00:23:45.080\nAgain, advanced micro devices.\n\n459\n00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.292\nAnd to kind of tell you what kind\nof outdated processor I have, or\n\n460\n00:23:48.292 --> 00:23:50.625\nsocket, I have the very\nfirst one on the list.\n\n461\n00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:52.961\nAnd that's the AM3 processor.\n\n462\n00:23:52.961 --> 00:23:58.110\nNow, AM3 processors they were the Phenom\nseries, specifically Phenom 2,\n\n463\n00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.551\nF1, 2, Sempron, and\ntheir server grade Opron.\n\n464\n00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:04.766\nOpteron, excuse me, Opteron, I'll get that\nright, sounds like a Transformer, right?\n\n465\n00:24:04.766 --> 00:24:07.671\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was gonna say they try to name\ntheir processors after Transformers,\n\n466\n00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:08.510\nit gets crazy [LAUGH].\n\n467\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly what it is.\n\n468\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.795\nJust remember Transformers, right?\n\n469\n00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:15.040\nAM3+ was the replacement to that and\nthat's where we get\n\n470\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.750\nthe bulldozer architecture, or typically\nwhat's known as the FX series for\n\n471\n00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:24.140\na brief time and also supported\nthe Phenom 2, Athlon 2, and Sempron.\n\n472\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:32.580\nNow, the last three here, these last three\nare what are considered APU's and we\n\n473\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.180\nhaven't really talked about that and that\nand that's Accelerated Processing Units.\n\n474\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.630\nAnd they're lower powered and they also\nsupport things like graphics as well.\n\n475\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.927\nThe FM1,\nthis was called the LANO processor, right?\n\n476\n00:24:46.927 --> 00:24:54.850\nThis was the LANO processor as well as\nthe Gen 2 Accelerated Processing Unit,\n\n477\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.640\nmake sure I get that acronym right, and\nthat was the AMD Trinity technology.\n\n478\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.707\nLast one is the AM2+, and again, remember\nthese FMs, they're low powered, right?\n\n479\n00:25:04.707 --> 00:25:11.610\nAgain, low powered boards, they save you\nmoney and also, they generate less heat.\n\n480\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.510\nThat's the FM2+, and\nagain, that APU is for\n\n481\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.660\nthe Kaveri and this last one almost sounds\nlike chocolate, and that's Godavari.\n\n482\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.500\nNot Ghirardelli but Godavari.\n\n483\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.330\nSo, Aaain guys I know the last bit here,\nman we threw a bunch of specifications.\n\n484\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.670\nAnd guys like I've said,\nmany times throughout this series,\n\n485\n00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.470\nit's like setups and you guys can\nlook at me know I hate setups.\n\n486\n00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:39.270\nBut, I want you to take Dan's advise get\nout the flash cards, type the notes.\n\n487\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.190\nI remember when was studying for\nA+ I literally would write these down and\n\n488\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.810\nI'd crumple up the paper and\nthrow it away.\n\n489\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.180\nAnd then write them down,\ncrumple up the paper and throw them away.\n\n490\n00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.637\nAnd then once I'd passed the exam,\nI'd do exactly what Dan said,\n\n491\n00:25:50.637 --> 00:25:53.310\nI'd Google it right and\nadd it to the motherboard.\n\n492\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.865\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of specifications guys, but\n\n493\n00:25:55.865 --> 00:25:57.610\ndon't let it confuse you.\n\n494\n00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.890\nDon't let it intimidate you,\njust dig in, memorize it, and\n\n495\n00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.760\nyou can pass the A+ certification as well.\n\n496\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right, well Wes says\ntalking about is that repetition,\n\n497\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.990\nit breeds retention.\n\n498\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.840\nDon't forget that, so go over and over and\n\n499\n00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.855\nover and\nover until it's like second nature to you.\n\n500\n00:26:10.855 --> 00:26:13.962\nYou're just got to sit in that testing\nbooth and you'll smoke this thing out.\n\n501\n00:26:13.962 --> 00:26:16.430\nAll right everyone, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of today's episode.\n\n502\n00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.110\nWe do thank you for\n\n503\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.350\nwatching, signing off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n504\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n505\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.191\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:29.554\n[MUSIC]\n\n507\n00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:31.929\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.319\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProv TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.287\n&gt;&gt; All right greeting everyone and welcome\nto another great episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:20.891\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well we are moving on,\n\n7\n00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:24.636\nwith more on our A+,\nwhat is it, the 229-01 series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:29.217\nThat's right, good stuff here, joining us\nin the studio again is our good friend,\n\n9\n00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:30.140\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.740\nWes, I'm so glad to have you in\nthe studio again, man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.360\n&gt;&gt; Hey, man, it's going great, great to be\nhere as always with the ITPro TV crew, and\n\n12\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.990\nthat's right, like Dan says, we are moving\nalong in this journey that hopefully\n\n13\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.840\nleads you to a passing score\non that A+ certification.\n\n14\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.550\nAnd well, what are we talking about today?\n\n15\n00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.360\nBut, well, we're gonna be talking about\nconnections, all kinds of connections.\n\n16\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.470\nIf you've ever looked at any desktop\nthat's sitting on the ground,\n\n17\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.190\none of the things you've probably noticed\nis that there is a lot of times a rat's\n\n18\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.735\nnest hanging off the back of that.\n\n19\n00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:03.407\nWell, we're gonna follow those\nthose wires to the ports and\n\n20\n00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:08.159\nconnections on the PC, and we're gonna\nkinda give you some examples of some of\n\n21\n00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.700\nthe specifications that you\ncan expect to see on the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.820\nNow, not only external\nconnections as well but\n\n23\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.576\nwe're gonna talk briefly about\nsome internal connections,\n\n24\n00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:20.190\nbecause in past episodes we've talked\nabout things like magnetic hard drives.\n\n25\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.096\nWe've talked about solid state drives, and\nwe did say in those episodes that, hey,\n\n26\n00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:27.351\nwe are gonna tell you a little bit more\nabout the interfaces that we use to\n\n27\n00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.760\nconnect those storage\ndevices to the motherboard.\n\n28\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.750\nSo we are going to talk\nabout those as well, so\n\n29\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.390\nlet's go ahead and let's dive right in.\n\n30\n00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.702\nNow, in our motherboard episode,\n\n31\n00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:39.119\none of the things that we talked\nabout is something known as a bus.\n\n32\n00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.233\nAll right, we talked about a bus really\nbeing a collection of electrical\n\n33\n00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:44.532\nconductors, right.\n\n34\n00:01:44.532 --> 00:01:46.680\nThey're kinda like data highways,\nif you will,\n\n35\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.250\npaths that lead interconnection between\ncomponents along the motherboard.\n\n36\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.924\nBut I want you to know not only\ndo we have internal buses, but\n\n37\n00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:55.650\nwe also have external buses,right.\n\n38\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.397\nAnd an external bus again, is just\na connection, a cable, usually today,\n\n39\n00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:05.460\nit's usually a serial type cable that\nconnects to the outside of your computer.\n\n40\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.277\nAnd allows you to attach\nmultiple devices to the PC,\n\n41\n00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:13.613\nthere are a few different kinds\nthat we need to be aware of and\n\n42\n00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:19.290\none of the very early type of connectors\nthat is, bus is actually in its name.\n\n43\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.788\nIs something known as USB,\nthat is the Universal Serial Bus.\n\n44\n00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:26.372\nUniversal Serial Bus is something\nthat came along and I wanna say, Dan,\n\n45\n00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:30.157\nif I can remember some of my history\nright, it was Microsoft, it was Intel.\n\n46\n00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:34.701\nIntel was definitely a big factor\nin this as a way to have external\n\n47\n00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.850\nconnections to a computer.\n\n48\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.848\nYou've probably seen it today,\nin fact, today it's so\n\n49\n00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:46.011\ncommon that it isn't uncommon,\nI guess I should say, to see maybe 10,\n\n50\n00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:50.950\nsometimes up to 15 of these USB ports\nthat on the outside of the case.\n\n51\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830\nNow, what is a port, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.332\nI want you to understand that port\nis an opening, if you will, and\n\n53\n00:02:56.332 --> 00:03:00.345\non your motherboard, it could be on\nyour motherboard, or could be a part of\n\n54\n00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:04.702\nthe tower or the the chassis, if you will,\nthat holds the system unit together.\n\n55\n00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:09.256\nAnd it allows us to make a connection with\nsome kind of, typically copper conductor,\n\n56\n00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.786\ndoesn't always have to\nbe a copper conductor,\n\n57\n00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:14.900\nwe do have some that make\noptical connections too as well.\n\n58\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.255\nSo that's what we're gonna dive\ninto first, let's go ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:20.024\nlet's dive into USB, all right.\n\n60\n00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:23.775\nUniversal Serial Bus has had some\ndifferent revisions over the years and\n\n61\n00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:26.542\na lot of times the revisions\nhave to do with the speed,\n\n62\n00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.038\nthe speed of the interface.\n\n63\n00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:31.734\nAnd I've got a little bit of a diagram\nhere talking about some of the things that\n\n64\n00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.539\nwe need to be aware of when it\ncomes to Universal Serial Bus.\n\n65\n00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.628\nNow, some of these concepts that we're\ngonna talk about are kind of considered\n\n66\n00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:40.285\nlegacy by today's standards.\n\n67\n00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:44.421\nAnd what I mean by that is legacy is just\nsomething that's kinda out of date, and\n\n68\n00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:47.600\nin the computing world,\nout of date could be six months ago.\n\n69\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.995\nDan, I seen a commercial one time and\nthis guy, he was just happy,\n\n70\n00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:54.615\nhe had the latest, greatest,\nbrand new computer.\n\n71\n00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:56.738\nIn fact,\nhe was walking out of the store with it.\n\n72\n00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:57.415\n&gt;&gt; I remember this commercial.\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember that?\n\n73\n00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:58.955\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n&gt;&gt; And he turns around,\n\n74\n00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.885\nlooks up at the sign, and\nthey're actually taking the sign down for\n\n75\n00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:04.690\nhis brand new computer that he\nhasn't even left the store with, and\n\n76\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.810\nthey're coming out with a new model.\n\n77\n00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.930\nSo, understand that legacy, I know\nit really is a relative term because\n\n78\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.850\nthings move so fast in computing today.\n\n79\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.635\nHowever, you're starting to\nsee some things slow down.\n\n80\n00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:20.530\nWe've finally come to a certain point\nwhere what we're really doing is trying to\n\n81\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.480\nupdate speed and really shrinking\neverything down to smaller packages.\n\n82\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.516\nNow let's go ahead and we're gonna jump\nin our DeLorean here and we're gonna take\n\n83\n00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:31.655\na trip back through time and we're gonna\ntalk about the very first standard 1.1.\n\n84\n00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:35.442\nNow you might say, well wait a second,\n1.1, what happened to 1.0?\n\n85\n00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:40.100\nWell, 1.0 wasn't really widely adopted\nwhen the USB standard come out.\n\n86\n00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.020\nAnd it wasn't until 1.1 that it really\nstarted to take a foothold in PCs and\n\n87\n00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.430\nbecome common.\n\n88\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.070\nUniversal Serial Bus, understand that it\nis a serial interface, all right, and\n\n89\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.430\nthe difference between a serial and\n\n90\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.260\na parallel interface is a serial interface\nmeans sequential ones and zeroes.\n\n91\n00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.650\nAnd there can be a couple of ways\nthat a serial communication happens.\n\n92\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.240\nThere's what's known as synchronous\nserial communications and\n\n93\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.270\nasynchronous serial communications.\n\n94\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.260\nWhen we talk about synchronous\nserial communications guys,\n\n95\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.210\nI want you to think about metronome,\nright.\n\n96\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.340\nAny of you guys out there in music, right\ntiming, a heartbeat, synchronous, right.\n\n97\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.300\nSynchronous seems that there's some kind\nof beat pattern, if you will, that say,\n\n98\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.930\nhey this is the timing and this is how\nwe're gonna synchronize our information.\n\n99\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.866\nAsynchronous, right, that comes from\na word, right, asynchronous, right,\n\n100\n00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:25.598\nsynchronization.\n\n101\n00:05:25.598 --> 00:05:29.697\nA, meaning again, synchronous meaning\ntime, it means it isn't synchronized to\n\n102\n00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:33.560\na heartbeat, and how they synchronize\nserial communications, if you will,\n\n103\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.480\nover an asynchronous communication is that\nI have a start bit that says hey Dan,\n\n104\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.559\nwe're gonna start recording right now.\n\n105\n00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:42.804\nAnd then I say hey Nan, I'm gonna send you\nanother little bit of information that\n\n106\n00:05:42.804 --> 00:05:45.012\nsays okay, hey Dan,\nwe're done recording, right.\n\n107\n00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:47.951\nSo a start and\nstop as they typically call it, so\n\n108\n00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:53.090\na little bit more about the serial\ninformation or serial type communication.\n\n109\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.320\nAnd I just wanna take a second and\ncontrast that to a parallel communication.\n\n110\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.430\nParallel communications do have some,\nthey're kinda problematic.\n\n111\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.270\nParallel communications are when\nyou have a series of copper\n\n112\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.954\nconductors that are adjacent to each\nother, they run parallel to each other.\n\n113\n00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:09.734\nAnd the problem with those is they do, you\nlimit how much power you can put across\n\n114\n00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:12.783\nthem, and that's because any,\nkinda communication that goes\n\n115\n00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:15.606\ndown a single copper conductor\ncan have a negative effect or\n\n116\n00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:18.959\nadverse effect on the data that's\ncarried across the adjacent line.\n\n117\n00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:22.574\nIt's what they call crosstalk, guys,\nyou can think of it as electromagnetic\n\n118\n00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:25.202\ninterference, right,\nwe can only put so much power over\n\n119\n00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:29.580\nparallel communication before we start\nto get that bleed over, if you will.\n\n120\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.450\nNow Universal Serial Bus again\nserial communications 1.1,\n\n121\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.310\nwhat do we need to know about that?\n\n122\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.372\nWell, 1.1, well I tel you what,\nbefore we actually talk about speeds,\n\n123\n00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:41.750\nlet's talk about the overall\nbasics of Universal Serial Bus.\n\n124\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.510\nWhen we look at a Universal Serial Bus,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n125\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.475\nthe ports that are on your computer,\nyou can get five volts of power, right.\n\n126\n00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:52.148\nWe talked about, in another episode, we\ntalked about some of the power voltages,\n\n127\n00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:55.234\nexcuse me,\nthat you have coming off the power supply.\n\n128\n00:06:55.234 --> 00:06:58.697\nWe talked about 3.3,\n5 volts and 12 volts, well,\n\n129\n00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:01.453\na single USB port supports\n5 volts of power.\n\n130\n00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:05.374\nSo if you have a device that connects\nto it externally and is powered and\n\n131\n00:07:05.374 --> 00:07:08.770\nonly requires five volts of power,\nthen you're just fine.\n\n132\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.130\nHowever, keep in mind,\nsome of these devices like external,\n\n133\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.050\nthese bigger external hard drives that\nplug into USB ports require extra power so\n\n134\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.880\nthey usually have some kind\nof externally AC adapter.\n\n135\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.230\nNow, I said bus all right, so what is,\nif you think about it, a bus in general?\n\n136\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.080\nA bus also allows you to do what's known\nas daisy chaining, which means we can take\n\n137\n00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.560\nmultiple devices and connect them in\nseries, if you will, to a single port.\n\n138\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd USB is kinda interesting\nbecause theoretically it\n\n139\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.406\nsupports 127 devices on a single port.\n\n140\n00:07:41.406 --> 00:07:44.674\nAnd if any of you guys know a little bit\nabout your binary communications that\n\n141\n00:07:44.674 --> 00:07:48.196\nwe'll talk about a little bit later, like\nwhen we get into networking and stuff,\n\n142\n00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:51.541\nyou might say, well, 127,\nthat really isn't a binary number, right.\n\n143\n00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:54.855\nA binary number would be 128,\nand that's because, remember,\n\n144\n00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:57.599\nwhen we talk binary in computing,\nzero always counts.\n\n145\n00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:00.598\nOne of those bits is actually reserved for\nwhat's known as a host device.\n\n146\n00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:05.345\nAnd the host device is basically\nthe primary device that controls.\n\n147\n00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:07.403\nAll the other devices\nthat are on the chain.\n\n148\n00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:09.437\nSo 127 devices, if you will,\n\n149\n00:08:09.437 --> 00:08:13.737\nare the ones that are basically\nsubserving it to whatever the host is.\n\n150\n00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:17.640\nAnd again, so\n127 devices on a single port.\n\n151\n00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.179\nNow, keep in mind that 127 devices\non a single port is a nightmare.\n\n152\n00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.449\nIt's not really something\nthat you wanna do.\n\n153\n00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:27.877\n&gt;&gt; I can't imagine having 127 physical\ndevices in my office that's going to\n\n154\n00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:30.806\nconnect, let alone\ndaisy-chain itself around or\n\n155\n00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:34.007\nhave some sort of hub thing going on-\n&gt;&gt; When we talk about a rat's nest,\n\n156\n00:08:34.007 --> 00:08:35.094\nwe're talking about a rats den.\n\n157\n00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:36.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right.\n\n158\n00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:37.818\n[CROSSTALK] There will be boats of rats.\n\n159\n00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:39.513\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right so, and\n\n160\n00:08:39.513 --> 00:08:41.951\nnot to mention the contention, right?\n\n161\n00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:44.423\nWe don't really think about\nthis in today's day and age,\n\n162\n00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:47.610\nwith things like Voice over IP,\nwe've got products out there like Skype.\n\n163\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.794\nBut back in the earlier days,\nI say earlier days,\n\n164\n00:08:49.794 --> 00:08:52.566\nback in the 80s you had what\nwas called party lines, right?\n\n165\n00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:54.353\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Many people don't remember party lines\n\n166\n00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:58.310\ntoday, by today's standards, but you have\nmultiple people on a single communication.\n\n167\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.280\nNow I want you to think about having 127\npeople in a single room all talking at\n\n168\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.273\nthe same time.\n\n169\n00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:07.064\nIt does, it makes a little contention.\n\n170\n00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:08.670\n&gt;&gt; And\nit might sound a little noisy in there.\n\n171\n00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n172\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.834\nSo even though there is theoreticals,\nright?\n\n173\n00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:14.577\nAnd that's what we are talking about, and\nthat's what you need to know on the exam.\n\n174\n00:09:14.577 --> 00:09:17.147\nUnderstand that the feasibility,\nthe practicality of this,\n\n175\n00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.852\nit really isn't practical, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:23.061\nSo 127 devices on a single port, 5 volts\nof power, that's some of the basics that\n\n177\n00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:26.300\nyou definitely need to know\nabout Universal Serial Bus.\n\n178\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.068\nNow if we could take a look here\nat the diagram here one more time,\n\n179\n00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.316\nwe got USB standard 1.1.\n\n180\n00:09:30.316 --> 00:09:33.182\nThe other thing we also have to\nkeep in mind when it comes to\n\n181\n00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:37.487\nUniversal Serial Bus, is the fact that we\nhave different transmission speeds that we\n\n182\n00:09:37.487 --> 00:09:39.255\nwant you to be aware of on the exam.\n\n183\n00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:43.751\n1.1, stand back now, we're talking\nabout some high tech technology, right?\n\n184\n00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:44.800\nThat's redundant.\n\n185\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.972\nWe have 12 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n186\n00:09:47.972 --> 00:09:49.910\nAll right,\nwe talk about 12 megabit transfer speeds,\n\n187\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.030\nthat is essentially\nwhat's called throughput.\n\n188\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.603\nThroughput is the amount of information,\n\n189\n00:09:55.603 --> 00:10:00.040\nthe amount of bits that you can pass\nacross an interface in a given second.\n\n190\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.250\nWe're talking about 12\nmegabits per second.\n\n191\n00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.163\nNow, the next one is 2.0, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:06.163 --> 00:10:10.507\nAnd 2.0 actually kinda stood the test\nof time, it's still out there, still.\n\n193\n00:10:10.507 --> 00:10:13.160\nI've got it on some of the older\nmotherboards that I have too.\n\n194\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.594\nI want you to keep in mind that 2.0,\nit kinda shattered the record,\n\n195\n00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:21.126\nif you will, or\nshattered the earlier revision of USB,\n\n196\n00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:24.982\nbecause we now jumped up to\n480 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n197\n00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:28.773\nAnd know that all the same characteristics\nthat I told you about USB still apply to\n\n198\n00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:30.180\nthese different revisions.\n\n199\n00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.284\nWhat you're seeing is speeds,\nspeeds generally increase in 3.0.\n\n200\n00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:41.753\n3.0 now, it's almost 10 times what\nthe speed is of the earlier 2.0.\n\n201\n00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:46.885\nAnd that is just under around,\nor just about, if you will,\n\n202\n00:10:46.885 --> 00:10:53.572\n5000 megabits per second or what would\nequate to 5 gigabits per second.\n\n203\n00:10:53.572 --> 00:10:56.500\nNow, let me take a second, even though\nwe're talking about theoretical, right?\n\n204\n00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.130\nDan and I were just mentioning that you\ncouldn't imagine having 127 devices\n\n205\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.390\nliterally connected to a single port,\neven though it is theoretically capable.\n\n206\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.600\nI want you to understand that\nthese are theoretical numbers.\n\n207\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.800\nWhen it comes down to actual application,\nyou'll be lucky to see more than\n\n208\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.400\nlike on a 2.0 device, I don't care if it\nsays it's 480 megabyte transfer speeds,\n\n209\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.790\nwhich is what I want you to recognize for\nthe exam.\n\n210\n00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.570\nMight be the question they ask you.\n\n211\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.800\nIn the field, you'd be lucky to see around\n240 out of one of the best devices.\n\n212\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.620\nAnd again,\nthat's just because manufacturers vary,\n\n213\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.526\nand there's all different things that\nyou have to take into consideration.\n\n214\n00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:34.097\nAnd that being said, I also want you to\nunderstand that there are some connector\n\n215\n00:11:34.097 --> 00:11:35.866\ntypes that we have to talk about, too.\n\n216\n00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:41.072\nAnd that's the other column in\nthe diagram, you'll see that we have\n\n217\n00:11:41.072 --> 00:11:46.490\nUSB connector Type A, Type B,\nwe have mini, and we have micro.\n\n218\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.348\nAll right now, Type A, one of the most\ncommon ports you'll see today.\n\n219\n00:11:49.348 --> 00:11:53.041\nIn fact, we've kinda got a picture here\nto make it a little bit easier, so\n\n220\n00:11:53.041 --> 00:11:55.310\nwe don't have to be flying blind here.\n\n221\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.057\nThis is the type A connector and\nI've got two different kinds.\n\n222\n00:11:58.057 --> 00:12:00.267\nWe've got what's known as\nthe male connector and\n\n223\n00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:03.960\nthe male connector has the post and the\nfemale connector is the empty port, right?\n\n224\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.440\nThis is the A connector, it's one of the\nmost common USB ports that are out there.\n\n225\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.771\nIt is the same for 1.1, it is the same for\n2.0, it's the same for 3.0.\n\n226\n00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:18.331\nNow I will tell you 3.0 has an interesting\ncharacteristic that you can usually tell\n\n227\n00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:19.861\nit from the earlier legacy.\n\n228\n00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:24.775\nAnd that's typically that it has\na blue blade right under here,\n\n229\n00:12:24.775 --> 00:12:28.802\nunder the four pins that\nthe USB standard requires.\n\n230\n00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:30.403\nNow this other port right here,\n\n231\n00:12:30.403 --> 00:12:33.085\nthis is what's known as\na Full Size Type B Connector.\n\n232\n00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:36.980\nBe careful on this one, because a lot\nof people call it a printer port.\n\n233\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.708\nAnd I know Dan, if you and I were\ntalking outside of a certification exam,\n\n234\n00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:42.085\nI wouldn't correct anybody,\nI'm sure you wouldn't either.\n\n235\n00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.215\nWe would say yeah, it's the printer port.\n\n236\n00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:44.140\nBecause why?\n\n237\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.311\n[CROSSTALK] It's one of the most\ncommon ports, right, for\n\n238\n00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:47.695\na wired USB connection on a printer.\n\n239\n00:12:47.695 --> 00:12:52.545\n&gt;&gt; Printers, scanning devices, typically\nany kind of imaging or printing device,\n\n240\n00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:54.498\nyou'll see this very commonly.\n\n241\n00:12:54.498 --> 00:12:58.210\nI've also seen this a lot on\nolder external hard drives.\n\n242\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:58.710\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n243\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.970\n&gt;&gt; But then they got away from that.\n\n244\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.480\n&gt;&gt; And I know you're a big music fan.\n\n245\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.417\nI know you're into music,\n\n246\n00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.508\nthe other thing I've seen it\ninto is audio boards, as well.\n\n247\n00:13:05.508 --> 00:13:07.361\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Like mixing boards, it just,\n\n248\n00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:09.330\nthere's something about it.\n\n249\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.950\n&gt;&gt; It makes a really solid connection.\n\n250\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:11.477\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n251\n00:13:11.477 --> 00:13:13.306\n&gt;&gt; I think it's probably\nwhy it's preferred,\n\n252\n00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:15.998\nbecause when you plug that sucker in,\nit's a nice fat connector,\n\n253\n00:13:15.998 --> 00:13:19.120\nseats in very deeply and very nicely,\nand you don't have to worry about it.\n\n254\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.340\nYou'll notice that the smaller\nconnectors over there,\n\n255\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.760\nyou might have some trouble with it.\n\n256\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.570\nIf you pull one way or the other,\nthey'll come right out.\n\n257\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.972\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, so\nit's got many different applications.\n\n258\n00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.801\nAnd like I said, guys and gals out there,\nif we were out outside of a certification\n\n259\n00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.146\nendeavor, I wouldn't correct you\nif you say it's a printer port.\n\n260\n00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:35.816\nBecause it was for the longest time,\nup until things like wireless today,\n\n261\n00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:38.919\nthe most common wired connection\nyou could have for a printer.\n\n262\n00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:42.433\nNow, if we jump over to the other\nside of the tracks here,\n\n263\n00:13:42.433 --> 00:13:46.975\nmoving over towards the left,\nright next to the female Type A connector,\n\n264\n00:13:46.975 --> 00:13:50.359\nyou'll see what is known as\nthe mini Type A connector.\n\n265\n00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:51.640\n&gt;&gt; Can you point to that with your mouse?\n\n266\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.064\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Just because I have no idea\n\n267\n00:13:53.064 --> 00:13:53.842\nwhich one that is.\n\n268\n00:13:53.842 --> 00:13:55.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's probably a good thing.\n\n269\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.112\nThat's this one right here.\n\n270\n00:13:57.112 --> 00:13:58.453\nThis one right here is\nthe Type A connector.\n\n271\n00:13:58.453 --> 00:13:59.927\n&gt;&gt; There we go, okay.\n\n272\n00:13:59.927 --> 00:14:01.520\nCuz they always confused me.\n\n273\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.610\nI never understood which one was which,\nwhen it came to the mini and the micro.\n\n274\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.750\nI always get it wrong.\n\n275\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.718\n&gt;&gt; I do too.\nYeah, I do too, and\n\n276\n00:14:06.718 --> 00:14:09.887\nI probably shouldn't say that on camera,\nsince I'm teaching the A+ [CROSSTALK] but.\n\n277\n00:14:09.887 --> 00:14:10.538\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n278\n00:14:10.538 --> 00:14:12.589\nin practicality If you're not studying for\nthis-\n\n279\n00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:13.393\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\n\n280\n00:14:13.393 --> 00:14:16.012\nyou break out your\nmagnifying glass to see it.\n\n281\n00:14:16.012 --> 00:14:19.180\nAnd this is another one\nthat's commonly used.\n\n282\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.860\nBut probably one, and\nI'm gonna skip over this one here.\n\n283\n00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.690\nThis isn't a really common one here.\n\n284\n00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.030\nSo, I don't want you to worry\nabout this one for the exam.\n\n285\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.140\nBut the one that I do want you to\nworry about, these one's your micro.\n\n286\n00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.730\nNow micro, if you've got Android devices,\n\n287\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.190\nit's probably one of the ones that you've\nseen more than you've ever realized,\n\n288\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.250\nwhen you plug that power adapter\ninto that little wall wart, right?\n\n289\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.310\nYou plug it into the bottom\nof your Android based phones,\n\n290\n00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.800\nthat is the Micro Type A connector.\n\n291\n00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.240\nSo we definitely want you to know\nthose and understand what they are.\n\n292\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.219\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; The mini one looks little top-hat.\n\n293\n00:14:54.219 --> 00:14:55.003\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n294\n00:14:55.003 --> 00:14:58.600\n&gt;&gt; And the micro is just the wider,\nlooks like an angry face.\n\n295\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n296\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.540\nthat's a great way to say it.\n\n297\n00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.440\nAnd you know what?\n\n298\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.729\nThat might sound,\nit's actually really pretty funny.\n\n299\n00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:05.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n300\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.085\nthat's what's gonna commit it to memory,\ndo things like that.\n\n301\n00:15:09.085 --> 00:15:12.200\nThat' s actually some of the things\nthat I train people to do too,\n\n302\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.761\ncuz I've been teaching A+ now for\nlike seven years.\n\n303\n00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:17.105\nAnd I tell you,\nif you can remember jokes like that,\n\n304\n00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:19.087\nit can help cement it in\nyour mind what it is.\n\n305\n00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:22.522\nAnd when you go into the exam booth, if\nyou can make it funny, sometimes it helps\n\n306\n00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:25.950\nrelieve your stress a little bit\nwhen you're like, what is that one?\n\n307\n00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.337\nKnow these for the exam.\n\n308\n00:15:27.337 --> 00:15:28.561\nNow that being said,\n\n309\n00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:32.310\nthat isn't the only type of external\nBUS type connector we have.\n\n310\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.740\nWe have to move into one that's also been\naround for a while, and that is FireWire.\n\n311\n00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.659\nAll right, FireWire.\n\n312\n00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:40.663\nNow, here's where we're gonna\nget a little confusing on you,\n\n313\n00:15:40.663 --> 00:15:43.080\nbecause FireWire has\na few different names.\n\n314\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.320\nWhen FireWire first came out,\nthere were many different companies\n\n315\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.280\nthat were working with this\nnew connection, right?\n\n316\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.243\nApple happened to be one of them that\nhad some of the major contributions\n\n317\n00:15:54.243 --> 00:15:56.237\nto the earlier FireWire standard.\n\n318\n00:15:56.237 --> 00:16:01.206\nBut it was also being\noverseen by a collection of\n\n319\n00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:07.054\nmanufacturers under a standards\nbody called the IEEE.\n\n320\n00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:10.158\nThe Institute for Electronic and\nElectrical Engineers.\n\n321\n00:16:10.158 --> 00:16:13.078\nOr Electrical and\nElectronic Engineers if you will, IEEE.\n\n322\n00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:16.037\nAnd the IEEE actually calls it 1394.\n\n323\n00:16:16.037 --> 00:16:18.535\nAnd I don't want you to confuse that or\n\n324\n00:16:18.535 --> 00:16:21.590\nthink that that's some\nbig different cable.\n\n325\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.680\nFireWire, when it was released,\nthat was Apple's marketing name for it.\n\n326\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.045\nWhen it formally got standardized,\n\n327\n00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:33.783\nit was standardized as an industry-wide\nstandard under IEEE1394.\n\n328\n00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:37.788\nGuys, we're talking about tomato tomato,\nthose are the same exact cables.\n\n329\n00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:41.560\nAgain, one's a marketing name,\none's a standards name.\n\n330\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.590\nNow, let's talk a little\nbit more about FireWire,\n\n331\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.860\nwe'll talk about some of the speeds\ncoming up but it's interesting because\n\n332\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.080\nFireWire also allows you to do\nsomething called daisychaining right.\n\n333\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.320\nThe fact that we can\ntake multiple devices and\n\n334\n00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.710\nwe can just basically chain them together.\n\n335\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.497\nI can plug in one device to\nanother device, to another device,\n\n336\n00:16:58.497 --> 00:17:01.030\nwe do this a lot of the times\nthrough what is known as a hub.\n\n337\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.214\nA hub is a multi port device.\n\n338\n00:17:02.214 --> 00:17:04.994\nThey have USB hubs,\nthey have FireWire hubs and\n\n339\n00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:07.200\nwe can plug more than one device in.\n\n340\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.240\nHowever, the standards\nare different than USB.\n\n341\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.798\nThe standard inside of a FireWire is\ngoing, I want you to keep in mind,\n\n342\n00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:18.370\nis going to be 63 devices\nconnected to a single port.\n\n343\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.178\nHere we go with some of those numbers\nthat it's like, well, wait a second, 63.\n\n344\n00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:24.509\nAnd you guys as you go into your IT\ncareer, especially guys that are moving\n\n345\n00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:27.210\nonto network plus, might say,\nwell, wait a second 63?\n\n346\n00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.636\nIt shouldn't be 64 that's\na binary number right?\n\n347\n00:17:30.636 --> 00:17:35.166\nAnd there again, zero counts because\nthe one bit is actually reserved for\n\n348\n00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:39.404\nthe device of the controller if you\nwill that controls all the devices\n\n349\n00:17:39.404 --> 00:17:41.390\nalong this type of BUS.\n\n350\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.650\nPower, all right there's\na reason they call it FireWire.\n\n351\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.450\nWe're talking about a lot of power here.\n\n352\n00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.215\nWe're talking about 12 volts right?\n\n353\n00:17:47.215 --> 00:17:49.887\nSo remember when we were talking\nabout our power supply and\n\n354\n00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:53.170\nthose three main voltages, 3.3,\n5 volts, and 12 volts right?\n\n355\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.030\nWell USB uses 5 volts.\n\n356\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.710\nFireWire actually uses 12 volts.\n\n357\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.960\nSo I want you to keep that in mind that\nif you plug in to a powered port and\n\n358\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.940\nthere are some that are different.\n\n359\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.924\nWe'll show you those coming up here that\nyou're talking about 12 volts of power,\n\n360\n00:18:07.924 --> 00:18:11.586\nall right now what is up with\nthis FireWire 400 and 800?\n\n361\n00:18:11.586 --> 00:18:15.170\nI actually like the naming convention I\nwant you guys and gals out there to cement\n\n362\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.800\nthis to memory because 400 tells you what\nthe speeds are, 400 megabits per second.\n\n363\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.970\nAll right you also see FireWire 800\nwell guess what 800 megabits per second.\n\n364\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.510\nAnd I really like that naming convention\nbecause if you can remember the standard.\n\n365\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.120\nThe name and in the name,\nyou could also remember the speeds.\n\n366\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.112\nIt makes it a lot easier for\n\n367\n00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.470\nsome of this stuff that I realize\nis just sheer memorization.\n\n368\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.010\nSo, FireWire 400, 400 megabits per second.\n\n369\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.891\nIf you are FireWire 800, I think I said\nthat right FireWire400 400 megabits and\n\n370\n00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:45.245\nthen FireWire800 is 800 megabits.\n\n371\n00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:46.196\n&gt;&gt; They're giving you the answer.\n\n372\n00:18:46.196 --> 00:18:47.139\n&gt;&gt; They really are.\n\n373\n00:18:47.139 --> 00:18:48.089\n&gt;&gt; I love that about them.\n\n374\n00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:48.870\nThank you.\n\n375\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.700\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n376\n00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.099\nAnd again you gotta thank\ncapital on that one.\n\n377\n00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:55.190\nSteve Jobs defiantly\nmaybe had some foresight.\n\n378\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.821\nMaybe he knew that A+ exam was coming out\nbefore they even knew it was coming out.\n\n379\n00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:02.360\nNow, we do have a series of connections\nthat I want you to be aware of here.\n\n380\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.400\nWe have a 4 pin connection,\nwe have a 6 pin connection, and\n\n381\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.820\nwe have a 9 pin connection.\n\n382\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.760\nAnd there are differences not\nonly in the amount of pins but\n\n383\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.632\nalso the attributes of\nthe cables themselves.\n\n384\n00:19:13.632 --> 00:19:18.480\nAll right, Firewire400 uses the top\ntwo connectors that we see, and\n\n385\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.280\nI'll dive into them in a second.\n\n386\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.990\nFireWire 800 uses the square box pattern\nnine pin connector that you see here.\n\n387\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.670\nNotice in the upper-left hand corner of\nyour screen, you have four, six, and nine.\n\n388\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.670\nFour and\nsix are the two that you see at the top,\n\n389\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.190\nnine is the box pattern\nthat you see in the bottom.\n\n390\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.144\nThe top one is FireWire 400,\nthe bottom one is FireWire 800.\n\n391\n00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:39.040\nNow there are some characteristics.\n\n392\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.415\nDan, just like we were talking about with\nUSB that we kinda got to go over for\n\n393\n00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:43.284\nFireWire 400.\n\n394\n00:19:43.284 --> 00:19:48.540\nYou'll see and when I was studying it,\nthey always had a square shape.\n\n395\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.807\nIt's got kind of this like-\n&gt;&gt; Dent?\n\n396\n00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:53.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looks like somebody grabbed\nit with a pair of pliers and broke it.\n\n397\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.480\nBut that's actually part\nof the the connection tube.\n\n398\n00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.350\nYou can remember it on the exam\nas the square type connector.\n\n399\n00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.300\nIt's a 4 pin connector, but\nI want you to also know it's unpowered.\n\n400\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.855\nThis is an unpowered square\n4 pin connector, and\n\n401\n00:20:07.855 --> 00:20:13.360\nthat's unlike one of the most common\nFireWire connectors that you see.\n\n402\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.530\nThat is a 6 pin connector and\nif you want to remember it on the exam,\n\n403\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.750\nI always remember it as a bullet shaped\nconnector and a bullet has a lot of\n\n404\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.320\npower behind it, right, so\npower connector, a 6 pin power connector.\n\n405\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.796\n800, thank goodness they made it easy.\n\n406\n00:20:27.796 --> 00:20:30.782\nWe just have a nine [CROSSTALK].\n\n407\n00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:31.610\n&gt;&gt; One single connector.\n\n408\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.393\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n409\n00:20:32.393 --> 00:20:34.749\nAnd this is actually a better\nconnector than both the other one.\n\n410\n00:20:34.749 --> 00:20:35.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it looks like it\nactually kinda clips in.\n\n411\n00:20:35.785 --> 00:20:38.260\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly a good, good.\n\n412\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.379\nSmart guy he got that\none right on the money.\n\n413\n00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:43.795\nAnd that's exactly it just like you\nwere saying you know like the US\n\n414\n00:20:43.795 --> 00:20:47.638\ntype B connector, where it's not as,\nit's a little bit more difficult,\n\n415\n00:20:47.638 --> 00:20:51.250\nyou could still pull it out fairly\neasy if you actually yank on it.\n\n416\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.790\nThis one's a little bit more feral,\nif you will.\n\n417\n00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.397\nThe fact that it's a little bit more\nheavy-duty and it does stay locked in.\n\n418\n00:20:57.397 --> 00:21:02.123\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we need to keep in mind\n\n419\n00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:05.180\nwhen it comes to FireWire and USB.\n\n420\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.550\nAgain guys,\nthese are some of the specifications,\n\n421\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.010\nsome of the characteristics,\nwe want you to be aware of them.\n\n422\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.585\nNow, I wanna take a few more minutes and\nI wanna kind of compare USB\n\n423\n00:21:14.585 --> 00:21:17.976\nto FireWire because by the numbers\nwe've talked about this.\n\n424\n00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:21.104\nAnd we were talking about\nthis in our CPU episodes,\n\n425\n00:21:21.104 --> 00:21:24.470\nmarketing is a lot of times\nit's a numbers game right?\n\n426\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.230\nIf I tell you that you\nhave 300 of something or,\n\n427\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.900\nhow about this,\nif I tell you you have 480 of something or\n\n428\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.020\nI can give you 400 of something, don't\nworry about what the something is, right?\n\n429\n00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.990\nYou're gonna probably say, hey I think I'm\ngonna do better if I have the 480, right?\n\n430\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.340\nOf something that you're\ngonna give me $480, right?\n\n431\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.627\nIf I said I'm gonna give you $480\nin one hand or you could $400.\n\n432\n00:21:47.627 --> 00:21:51.125\nNo curve balls here, this is what you get.\n\n433\n00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:55.112\nWell you would automatically think in\na marketing sense that hey 480 is gonna be\n\n434\n00:21:55.112 --> 00:21:56.165\nbetter than 400.\n\n435\n00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:58.825\nLet's go ahead and\ntake that analogy out of dollars and\n\n436\n00:21:58.825 --> 00:22:03.015\nlet's talk about the bits that USB and\nFireWire transfer across their cables.\n\n437\n00:22:03.015 --> 00:22:08.011\nAll right you'll see by the numbers\nthat USB 2.0 has 480 mb transfer speed.\n\n438\n00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:12.624\nYou will see FireWire 400\n400 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n439\n00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:17.010\nDo you get a benefit one over the other?\n\n440\n00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.580\nWell it depends.\n\n441\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.440\nUSB, it does something\ninteresting to its data.\n\n442\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.430\nIt takes large files and\nit breaks them up.\n\n443\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.730\nIt does what's known as segmentation.\n\n444\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.610\nAnd it sends sequential information that's\nbeen segmented across that serial bus.\n\n445\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.630\nFireWire doesn't do that.\n\n446\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.970\nFireWire can take the full five\ngallon bucket and throw it at you.\n\n447\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.120\nIt doesn't have to pull it out in\nlittle small glasses of water and\n\n448\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.160\nthen send it one cup at a time.\n\n449\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240\nAnd so what the heck does that even mean,\nright?\n\n450\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.280\nWell, it means that if I have\nlet's say a 4 GB file, right?\n\n451\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.584\nBy today's standards that's not really\nbig, back when this first came out that\n\n452\n00:22:53.584 --> 00:22:56.705\nwould have been a pretty big file and\nit would have taken a while to transfer.\n\n453\n00:22:56.705 --> 00:23:01.391\nBut if I take a 4 GB file and I have 4\nGB of individual small files, kilobytes,\n\n454\n00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:04.730\nmegabytes if you will, but\na whole bunch of them right?\n\n455\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.711\nA whole bunch of,\na stack of papers if you will.\n\n456\n00:23:06.711 --> 00:23:10.260\nUSB will do pretty good at\nthat transfer rate, right?\n\n457\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.120\nIt'll do really good, all right.\n\n458\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.750\nBut you take that,\ncompared to FireWire if you will.\n\n459\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.566\nYou take that 4 gig file and\nmake it a video file and\n\n460\n00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:23.555\nI love the, all pun intended.\n\n461\n00:23:23.555 --> 00:23:25.005\nHere goes.\n\n462\n00:23:25.005 --> 00:23:26.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; USB doesn't hold a candle to\n\n463\n00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:27.550\nFireWire all right?\n\n464\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.350\nAnd that's because FireWire doesn't\nhave to break information down.\n\n465\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.339\nIt can send raw uncompressed information\nacross that wire and it can send it fast.\n\n466\n00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.354\nThat's one of the reasons it's used in\nhigh definition videos up until some of\n\n467\n00:23:40.354 --> 00:23:43.631\nthe other connections that we'll\ntalk about during this episode or\n\n468\n00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:45.500\nmaybe in part two like thunder bolt.\n\n469\n00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.390\nThunder bolt is the successor, pretty much\nkind of like the successor to FireWire.\n\n470\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.321\nFireWire is for a long time been very,\n\n471\n00:23:52.321 --> 00:23:55.880\nvery good in things like high\ndefinition video conferencing systems.\n\n472\n00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.350\nA company I used to work for Dan,\nhad what was known as a life size system.\n\n473\n00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.340\nIn fact I think we still have some of\nthese systems here in the background when\n\n474\n00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.752\nwe're doing video conferencing.\n\n475\n00:24:03.752 --> 00:24:08.582\nAnd one of the cameras they had was\neight grand, very high definition video,\n\n476\n00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:13.190\nand they both had the whole system was\njust littered with the six pin bullet\n\n477\n00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.676\nshape FireWire connectors and\nyou know what the USB connector was for?\n\n478\n00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:21.037\nKeyboard and mouse [CROSSTALK],\nit wasn't for the video and so,\n\n479\n00:24:21.037 --> 00:24:22.354\nthere are differences.\n\n480\n00:24:22.354 --> 00:24:24.066\nDon't let the numbers fool you and\n\n481\n00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:28.080\nthe other thing I say in reality a lot\nof these numbers are theoretical.\n\n482\n00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.147\nWhat you see in actual\nspeed is really relative\n\n483\n00:24:32.147 --> 00:24:36.848\nto how well the manufacturer\nimplements the device.\n\n484\n00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:40.620\nIn another episode, we had a great comment\nin the chatroom and Dan, I think you\n\n485\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.279\npicked up on this, that says just because\nyou couldn't get in an adapter and\n\n486\n00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:48.020\nsave money doesn't mean it's gonna give\nyou the performance that you need.\n\n487\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.560\nWell, it's the same way.\n\n488\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.030\nManufacturers that put cheap\nimplementations in their hardware means\n\n489\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.580\nthat just because the theoretical pathway\nis there, I can't turn around and\n\n490\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:01.810\ntake my old 84 Ford with a four-cylinder\nand expect to outperform the Shelby Cobra.\n\n491\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.506\nIt just really depends on\nhow they're implemented.\n\n492\n00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:05.254\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes Who knew that there were so\n\n493\n00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:09.356\nmuch to know all about these different\ntypes of cables and connectors that we're\n\n494\n00:25:09.356 --> 00:25:12.874\ngonna be messing around with as\na plus technicians, but guess what?\n\n495\n00:25:12.874 --> 00:25:16.781\nThere is, there's a ton of information\nbecause there's a ton of different types\n\n496\n00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:20.573\nof connections, and I know that we are not\neven close to done with the connectors\n\n497\n00:25:20.573 --> 00:25:22.180\nwe're gonna be looking at here.\n\n498\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.240\nSo, looks like we're gonna have\nto go to a part two on this one.\n\n499\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.438\nProbably even farther [LAUGH].\n\n500\n00:25:26.438 --> 00:25:28.404\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that being said,\n\n501\n00:25:28.404 --> 00:25:29.323\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n502\n00:25:29.323 --> 00:25:30.804\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n503\n00:25:30.804 --> 00:25:32.970\nFor ITProTV I have been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n504\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:33.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n505\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.713\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:25:34.713 --> 00:25:42.587\n[MUSIC]\n\n507\n00:25:42.587 -->

00:00:11.922\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.792\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:16.340\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.230\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and for\n\n7\n00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.610\ntoday's episode we are continuing\non with more in our A-plus, 220901.\n\n8\n00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.490\nI almost got that one wrong that time.\n\n9\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.060\nForgot where I was for a moment.\n\n10\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.150\nBut I'll rejoin us back, and joining\nus back as well, our good friend Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.680\nWes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.280\nWes, glad to have you again, man.\n\n13\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.500\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.485\nThis is Earth, stay a while.\n\n15\n00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:36.065\nRight.\n\n16\n00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:40.485\nWe are continuing along in our PC\nconnection and characteristics, I think,\n\n17\n00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.245\nminiseries we're going to have.\n\n18\n00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:46.855\nYou might have known that this is actually\na part two, and Dan said at the end of\n\n19\n00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:51.670\npart one that we might be here a while,\nbecause there are various connections that\n\n20\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.550\nyou can make, inside and outside of\nyour personal computing environment.\n\n21\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.730\nIn the first part,\n\n22\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.170\nwe really talked about two of the major\nones that have been around for awhile.\n\n23\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.632\nWe talked about fire wire,\nand we talked about USB.\n\n24\n00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:07.592\nKnow some of those statistics for\nthe exam, know some of the specifications,\n\n25\n00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:10.412\nI guess I should say, so\nthat if they ask you on the exam,\n\n26\n00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:12.040\nyou will be prepared to pass it.\n\n27\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.650\nNow with that being said,\nwe're gonna move on down the river here.\n\n28\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.620\nAnd the next one that we're gonna\ntalk about really relates to storage.\n\n29\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.080\nRight?\nStorage devices.\n\n30\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.160\nAnd it doesn't matter if we're\ntalking about magnetic media, or\n\n31\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.480\nwe're talking about electronic storage.\n\n32\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.740\nWe are talking about hard drives or\nsolid state drives,\n\n33\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.450\nand that's something known as serial ATA.\n\n34\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.165\nNow, as you guys are probably familiar,\nthe A plus isn't as shy in any means.\n\n35\n00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:42.945\nWith acronyms,\nyou might hear it called SATA drive,\n\n36\n00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:45.625\nyou might hear it called serial ATA,\n\n37\n00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:50.245\nall stemS back from the very earliest\ndrives that were called ATA drives.\n\n38\n00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:52.535\nAnd actually it started out as IDE drives,\nand\n\n39\n00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:57.160\nthen they were retro named ATA for\nAdvanced Technology Attachment.\n\n40\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.490\nWe talked about in our\nmotherboard episodes,\n\n41\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.850\nATX was Advanced Technology Extended,\nwell, this actually ATA\n\n42\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.810\nprecedes ATX, going back to the earlier\nAT boards, hence the name ATA.\n\n43\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.630\nThere was an advanced technology\nmotherboard attachment.\n\n44\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.410\nSo we're talking about\ndrive interfaces here.\n\n45\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.790\nAnd in the earlier days these IDE drives,\nsuch as graded drive electronics,\n\n46\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.420\nthey started to call them that because\nof the fact the drives themselves had\n\n47\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.390\nintegrated controllers on\nthe hard drives themselves.\n\n48\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.260\nWell, that's kinda stuck around.\n\n49\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.590\nThat hasn't changed.\n\n50\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.770\nIn the earlier days on computing,\n\n51\n00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.200\nif you were to get a hard drive that\nwas a whopping ten megs in size,\n\n52\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.020\nthe drive was probably the size of a small\nrefrigerator, and it had an expansion card\n\n53\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.320\nthat it would connect to, and\nthat was a controller card.\n\n54\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.390\nWell, like all technology,\ntechnology gets faster.\n\n55\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.950\nWe talked about it also getting smaller\nin size, that makes it a little bit more\n\n56\n00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.760\nefficient, we could pack a lot more\nstuff inside of these system units.\n\n57\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.760\nThey said well you know what,\nhow about this,\n\n58\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.770\nhow about we take that drive controller,\n\n59\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.890\nwhich is essentially what allows to access\ninformation on and off the hard drive.\n\n60\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.390\nAnd we'll take that controller and we'll\nslap it right on the hard drive itself.\n\n61\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.890\nYou can see this in a lot of your serial\nATA drives that there's a little PCB,\n\n62\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.700\na little Green printed circuit board\nwith wires or traces along it,\n\n63\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.780\nand it was what allows you to\nread information from the drive,\n\n64\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.210\nor write the information to the drive.\n\n65\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.450\nNow let's talk a little bit about\nthe serial ATA standards, SATA standards.\n\n66\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.120\nThere are a few revisions.\n\n67\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.110\nAnd I actually got a small little diagram\nhere of those revisions that we need to\n\n68\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.230\nbe aware of.\n\n69\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.060\nNow we got serial ATA 1, 2, and 3.\n\n70\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.460\nAnd we also got something known as eSATA.\n\n71\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.420\neSATA, the e there is for\nexternal, external serial ATA,\n\n72\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.930\nand we'll get to that too.\n\n73\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.070\nNow, notice that I am saying Serial ATA.\n\n74\n00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.360\nThe earlier hard drives were\ncalled Parallel ATA drives,\n\n75\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.820\nPATA drives you might heard them called.\n\n76\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.500\nAnd that was a parallel interface, and\nthey use these 20 pin or 20 conductor and\n\n77\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.260\n40 conductor cables, I get ribbon cables.\n\n78\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.760\nHad a very short length, I think 18\ninches was the standard, the maximum, and\n\n79\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.650\nagain parallel communications\nhave a lot of interference.\n\n80\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.340\nSo the next generation type\nhard drive storage interface,\n\n81\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.540\nconnection if you will, to the motherboard\ncame out was a serial interface.\n\n82\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.430\nAnd a serial interface is great,\nbecause of the fact that\n\n83\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.450\nit eliminates things like cross talk, so\nthat is why we call it serial ATA, right?\n\n84\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.690\nEarlier parallel interfaces\nwere just not as efficient.\n\n85\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.880\nNow serial ATA one, when it came out,\n\n86\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.170\nit was kind of Earth shattering\nwhen we talk about speeds.\n\n87\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.680\nThe fastest of the parallel ATA devices\n\n88\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.930\nwas 133 megabyte transfer\nspeeds per second.\n\n89\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.330\nYou don't have to worry about parallel\nATA, at least I don't believe so,\n\n90\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.490\nbecause formerly on the objectives\nthey don't call it out anymore.\n\n91\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.490\nWhich is good, because we really\ndon't use it anymore, for\n\n92\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.650\nthe most part it is a legacy technology.\n\n93\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.520\nSerial ATA, the very first revision\nthat came out was 150 megabytes.\n\n94\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.200\nSo you could see right away\nthe very first standard,\n\n95\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.450\nbroke what the standards\nwere existing of the day.\n\n96\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.620\nThe other thing that was great about it,\nis the serial ATA cable, and\n\n97\n00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.760\nthis is something that I want you\nto know about the data cable.\n\n98\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.330\nThe data cable went from the parallel\nATA's limitation was 18 inches.\n\n99\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.180\nNow, if any of you guys have\nbeen in computing for a while,\n\n100\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.040\nyou're gonna come back and\n\n101\n00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.280\nprobably leave me a little nastygram\non our forums, just kidding, guys.\n\n102\n00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.210\nThat says, hey, I've seen 24 inch and\n32 inch parallel ATA cables and\n\n103\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.150\nI'll say, you will.\n\n104\n00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.540\nThe American National Standards Institute\nnever certified them, because of the fact\n\n105\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.220\nthat the longer a parallel cable, the more\nlikely it is to have signal attenuation,\n\n106\n00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.530\nthe progressive degradation of the signal\nas it gets farther from its source, and\n\n107\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.510\nincreased crosstalk.\n\n108\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.630\nBut that being said, the serial ATA\ncable has a 3.3 foot length, right, so\n\n109\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.780\nwe've got a lot more\nlength out of the cable.\n\n110\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.910\n150 megabyte per second when it\ncomes to the transfer speeds, and\n\n111\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.850\nthat's why sometimes you'll\nalso hear it called SATA 150,\n\n112\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.670\nyou might even hear it called SATA 1.5.\n\n113\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.310\nSo don't let those naming\nconventions confuse you.\n\n114\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.470\nNow, if you can remember\nthe very first standard,\n\n115\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.800\nit'll make it easy on the exam you guys.\n\n116\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.470\nWe've been talking about some memorization\ntechniques here, making it funny,\n\n117\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.940\nmaking little jokes about it that\ncan help cement it in your mind.\n\n118\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.980\nWe talked about firewire 800 and 400,\nthe speed's right there in the name.\n\n119\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.320\nIf you can remember Serial ATA-1 as\nbeing 150 megabyte transfer speeds,\n\n120\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.040\nevery standard after that doubles.\n\n121\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.832\nAll right, so\n\n122\n00:06:15.832 --> 00:06:20.790\nif we go to serial ATA-II, the SATA-II\nrevision was 300 megabyte transfer speeds.\n\n123\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.360\nAll right, so a little bit easier.\n\n124\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.310\nNow, cable lengths stay the same,\nwhich is great.\n\n125\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.050\nYou only have to remember one\ncable length for the data cable.\n\n126\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.640\nWe'll talk a little bit more\nabout data cable coming up.\n\n127\n00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.910\nNow, with the prevalence of solid state\nmedia, the fact that we need some\n\n128\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.360\nfast transfer speeds and faster transfer\nspeeds, the problem with the Serial ATA II\n\n129\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.400\nis that it didn't give us\na great amount of bandwidth,\n\n130\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.140\nthat we can really take advantage of\nsolid state drives, electronic storage.\n\n131\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.950\nWe've talked about storage mechanisms\nthat don't have mechanical moving parts.\n\n132\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.590\nWe send send an electric current,\ndata is accessible almost instantaneously.\n\n133\n00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.940\nSo when they came out with the third\nrevision, it doubled yet again.\n\n134\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.450\nAnd in Serial ATA III, that's where\nwe can start to take advantage\n\n135\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.450\nof some of the speeds\nof a solid state drive,\n\n136\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.520\nbecause of the fact that we get\n600-megabyte transfer speeds.\n\n137\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.300\nAll right, so again, don't let some of\nthese naming conventions confuse you,\n\n138\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.020\ncuz you might see\nSerial ATA 1 as SATA 1.5.\n\n139\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.150\nYou might see Serial ATA\n2 as called Serial 3.0,\n\n140\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.380\nand then finally 6.0 for Serial ATA III.\n\n141\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.940\nThose are some of the specifications\nthat I want you to know,\n\n142\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.260\nwhen it comes to Serial ATA.\n\n143\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.740\nNow, in the earlier parallel ATA devices,\n\n144\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.540\nyou could have two devices\non a single channel.\n\n145\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.290\nYou would have a master and slave drive,\nand those terms are absolutely horrible,\n\n146\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.390\nso I'm going to use them once.\n\n147\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.357\nAnd then we're gonna move on to\nsomething that's a little bit better.\n\n148\n00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:52.830\nThe master, or the primary device, was\nwhat controlled the communication channel\n\n149\n00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.736\nand the secondary, or what they call\nit in those days, the slave device,\n\n150\n00:07:56.736 --> 00:08:00.078\nwould basically,\nit wouldn't control the channel, right?\n\n151\n00:08:00.078 --> 00:08:03.818\nThe interesting thing about serial ATA\nis that it only supports one drive per\n\n152\n00:08:03.818 --> 00:08:04.920\nchannel.\n\n153\n00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.600\nAnd you might say, well,\nwow, how is that efficient?\n\n154\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.980\nWell, parallel ATA in the day,\n\n155\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.760\nhad a maximum of four devices that could\nbe on any motherboard at one time.\n\n156\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.720\nThat means you would have two channels,\neach channel would have a primary and\n\n157\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.160\nsecondary drive.\n\n158\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.120\nSerial ATA You can have ten\nserial ATA ports on motherboards.\n\n159\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.160\nI've seen some with ten built into the\nmotherboard, and then you can turn around\n\n160\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.620\non top of that put another five\nin a card in an expansion slot.\n\n161\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.300\nSo even though it sounds like it's\na little limiting, it really isn't.\n\n162\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.050\nIt's the fact that they have multiple\nserial ATA seven pin ports on\n\n163\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.260\nthe motherboard, allowing you to do\nlarge RAID arrays, right, the redundant\n\n164\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.590\narray of independent disks that we've\ntalked about in another episode already.\n\n165\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.390\nIt allows me to aggregate these serial ATA\ndrives and basically like a multitasker,\n\n166\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.030\nright, or we can do it for fault tolerance\nor we can do it for a performance gain.\n\n167\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.570\nOr we can blend the two and\nwe get performance and\n\n168\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.460\nwe can get fault tolerance.\n\n169\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.630\nAnd that's really what allows us to do\nthese large type of RAID arrays today and\n\n170\n00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.890\na lot more convenient.\n\n171\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:10.290\nNow the other thing that I want to let you\nto know is serial ATA is also plug and\n\n172\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.180\nplay compatible.\n\n173\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.300\nMost of your modern BIOSs for a long time,\n\n174\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.260\nin the unified accessible\nfirmware interface,\n\n175\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.920\nwhich is just a modern form of BIOS if\nyou will, all support plug and play.\n\n176\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.740\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n177\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.740\nThat means when I plug in the drive in,\n\n178\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.820\nthe firmware can\ncommunicate with hardware,\n\n179\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.840\nit can allocate the memory resources,\nthe interrupt request lines that we used\n\n180\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.390\nto have to set in the earlier days, thank\ngoodness we don't have to do that anymore.\n\n181\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.750\nToday we can let the plug in place\nsub-system do this for us, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.190\nSo, that's a little bit about serial ATA,\nbut one last thing I'd like to talk about\n\n183\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:48.480\nis the ESATA that I mentioned, ESATA up\njust means external serial ATA, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.980\nNow, why is that beneficial for\n\n185\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.460\nus or why does it have the potential\nto be beneficial, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.470\nWhile you have USB based drives right?\n\n187\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.560\nThe USB based drives are what I plug,\ninto a USB port, right?\n\n188\n00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.200\nNow, you have to understand that your USB\nport and that drive information's gonna\n\n189\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.395\nhave to do like a little\ntranslation that's going on right?\n\n190\n00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:17.120\nAnd translation if you will,\nis going to, it runs\n\n191\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.300\nthe risk of just reducing the performance,\nright.\n\n192\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.560\nSince you already have SATA natively\nbuilt into your motherboard.\n\n193\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.060\nWhen you have an external SATA,\nyou're going from an external bus\n\n194\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.430\nright to the internal serial ATA bus\nwhich means there isn't any encoding or\n\n195\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.010\ntranslation that has to go on.\n\n196\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.890\nSo you can get the raw speeds of\nserial ATA in the internal aspect as\n\n197\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.172\nyou will close to what you can\nget on the external aspect.\n\n198\n00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:46.272\nSo when it comes down to it, it's one\nof the benefits of the external status,\n\n199\n00:10:46.272 --> 00:10:49.616\nthe fact that it's apples to apples,\nnot apples to oranges and\n\n200\n00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:53.580\nsomething in between trying to\ntranslate that information.\n\n201\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.680\nNow I mentioned the seven pin cable for\nserial ATA.\n\n202\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.316\nI want you guys to go ahead and take a\nlook at this, so with the SATA connectors,\n\n203\n00:11:01.316 --> 00:11:04.778\nit is 7 pin data cable that\nhas a maximum length of 3.3.\n\n204\n00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:09.131\nLet me make sure I get those feet right\nbecause I think it might actually be,\n\n205\n00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:12.810\nyeah it's 3.3 feet,\njust had to make sure I had that right.\n\n206\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.440\nAnd you can see right here we've talked\nabout actually that's an eSATA cable,\n\n207\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.930\nexcuse me sorry guys.\n\n208\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.000\nThere we go let's get\nthe cable right here.\n\n209\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.310\nThat is your seven pin data cable.\n\n210\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.492\nAll right, and you don't really\nhave to know this in the exam but\n\n211\n00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:31.986\nif you're wondering what the seven\npins are, you have four pins that\n\n212\n00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:36.070\nsend your information and\nyou have three ground pins.\n\n213\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.330\nNow, you'll notice here that,\nthis is an eSATA cable.\n\n214\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.039\nNotice that we have\nthe seven pin SATA cable,\n\n215\n00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:48.390\nthat plugs right in the motherboard and\nyou also have the external SATA,\n\n216\n00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.981\nthe eSATA port, and that would plug\ninto the external eSATA drive, right.\n\n217\n00:11:52.981 --> 00:11:59.031\nNow you can also see these on\nthe back of your towers as well,\n\n218\n00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:03.640\nwhere they have one of\nthe female eSATA port.\n\n219\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.420\nAnd then you just basically plug\nthe eSATA cable into the drive, and\n\n220\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.040\nthen plug that cable right\ninto the back of the PC.\n\n221\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.830\nSo couple different ways you can\nachieve an external SATA connection.\n\n222\n00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.950\nAll right, so those are your\nserial ATA connections, guys.\n\n223\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:24.260\nI know it's a lot of standards like many\nthings are that we talk about here at A+.\n\n224\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.550\nDon't let the numbers intimidate you.\n\n225\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.020\nJust like, both of us have mentioned,\n\n226\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.210\nflash cards might be\nthe way to go on this one.\n\n227\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.190\nWrite them down, throw them away.\n\n228\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.150\nWrite them down,\nthrow them away if you have to.\n\n229\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.400\nBut if you can get the sheer\nmemorization out of the way,\n\n230\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.100\ntrust me when I tell you this will be\nyesterday's news you'll speak the lingo.\n\n231\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.280\nAnd when it really comes down to it, if I\nneed to know what the specifications are,\n\n232\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.620\nthat's where search engines come in\nhandy if you're in the real world.\n\n233\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.300\nBut for the exam you need to\nprove that you know the language.\n\n234\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you do.\n\n235\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.480\nThey really wanna make sure that you\nhave a good foundational knowledge of\n\n236\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.080\nall these different types of connectors.\n\n237\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.250\nBecause as an A+ technician, you're\nmost likely going to encounter them,\n\n238\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.260\nyou need to be able to\neffectively work with them.\n\n239\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.140\nNow that being said, we're talking about\nthese connector types and cable types.\n\n240\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.010\nSome other types of connectors, I know\nthat when I think of things I'm typically\n\n241\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.100\ncabling up make a connection with,\nI'm going monitors, right?\n\n242\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.840\nAnd there's a multitude of different ways\nin which we can connect these things.\n\n243\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe're not out of the woods yet.\n\n244\n00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.270\nWe still have a little dredging through\nthe mud, we got a little more to go,\n\n245\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:23.820\nfor sure.\n\n246\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.190\nAnd that's right, there are a lot\nof different video connections and\n\n247\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.160\nbefore we actually get into the cables\nI want to just talk about basically,\n\n248\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.480\nthe fact we have analog video and\nwe have digital video today.\n\n249\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.290\nEarlier days all we had was analog\nvideo and as time progressed, digital\n\n250\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.880\nvideo came along and it is one of the most\ncommon implementations of video today.\n\n251\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.970\nSo some of the analog connection types for\nvideo that we're gonna talk about,\n\n252\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.310\nactually, there's a couple of them,\nare considered legacy today.\n\n253\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:56.100\nBut when I say legacy,\nthey're still out there, right and\n\n254\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.950\nlet me give you an example of\nwhere you get these a lot right.\n\n255\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.090\nOn your servers right your servers we\ndon't care about the quality of the video\n\n256\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.030\nbecause all I need to see is a low\ntext almost BIOS type screen.\n\n257\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.990\nIf I am doing any local management\nof the device to begin with,\n\n258\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.080\nright, we use a lot of times we use remote\ntechnologies to configure these devices.\n\n259\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.150\nSo you still see them, and\n\n260\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.270\nwhat I'm talking about here is something\nknown as the video graphics array.\n\n261\n00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.450\nI actually got some pictures\nhere that we can kinda look at.\n\n262\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.485\nAnd video graphics array, VGA,\nthis was actually the successor.\n\n263\n00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:29.000\nWe're gonna date ourselves\nhere on this one.\n\n264\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.670\nThis was actually\nthe successor to monochrome.\n\n265\n00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.480\nYes, green and white or\nblack and white screen, right?\n\n266\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.410\nAnd it's been around for a very long time.\n\n267\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.130\nAnd like I said, even though it's old,\nyou can still see it, right?\n\n268\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.030\nWe still have some of the monitors around\nhere that we don't really have in our\n\n269\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.870\nproduction environment\nthat are still using it.\n\n270\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.115\nLike I said, in cellular server closets\nwhere video isn't a necessity, like,\n\n271\n00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:55.430\nhigh-end video, digital video, we couldn't\nreally care less about that, so you'll see\n\n272\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.290\nthese connections to do any kind of local\nadministration on those type of computers.\n\n273\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.462\nNow, what are some things that I want\nto know when it comes to VGA cable?\n\n274\n00:15:04.462 --> 00:15:08.947\nAll right, there are couple of different\nstandards that it's sometimes called by.\n\n275\n00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:15.922\nYou might see things like DB15,\nDB15 if you will D-shaped connector and\n\n276\n00:15:15.922 --> 00:15:20.540\nagain it's a 15 pin connector, all right?\n\n277\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.290\nNow of the things that I want you\nto understand too is some of these\n\n278\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.450\nconnections that we talk about,\nwe talk about female connectors and\n\n279\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.910\nwe talk about male connectors, all right.\n\n280\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.230\nNow certainly isn't anatomy lesson but\nkeep in mind that when we talk about\n\n281\n00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.460\nthe male connectors, the male connectors\ntypically have the post pins or prongs\n\n282\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.560\nif you will and the female connectors\nare typically the ports or the openings.\n\n283\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.849\nSo if we can take a look\nat this picture again,\n\n284\n00:15:40.849 --> 00:15:43.500\nI want you to know that on\nthe back of a video monitor or\n\n285\n00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.868\na monitor that you're gonna plug into,\nyou might see the female connector, right?\n\n286\n00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:52.719\nAnd then you'll see, for instance here,\nwe have the posts on this VGA connector,\n\n287\n00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:57.525\nright, that is the male connector with the\npost pins or if you will, post or pins.\n\n288\n00:15:57.525 --> 00:15:58.486\nKnow that.\n\n289\n00:15:58.486 --> 00:16:01.793\nKnow that if you have\na 15 pin male connector,\n\n290\n00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:05.520\nit is going to connect to\na 15 pin female connector.\n\n291\n00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.170\nNow, that seems like something\nthat's very simplistic.\n\n292\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.613\nBut it might be something\nthey ask you on the exam.\n\n293\n00:16:10.613 --> 00:16:15.048\nAnd they might say,\nyou have a 15 pin cable.\n\n294\n00:16:15.048 --> 00:16:17.704\nWhat kind of port is it\ngoing to connect to?\n\n295\n00:16:17.704 --> 00:16:21.090\nAnd you might have to notice something\nlike DB15 female connectors.\n\n296\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.864\nSo I know I'm kind of\nnitpicking on this one.\n\n297\n00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:27.360\nBut you never know if they're\ngonna nitpick you on the exam.\n\n298\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.770\nAnd we definitely want you to be prepared.\n\n299\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.180\nWe don't want you something to\ncatch you off guard there, right?\n\n300\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.150\nI mean that's just gonna happen,\nwe can't study every single thing.\n\n301\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.560\nBut the more prepared you are, the better.\n\n302\n00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.500\nNow as time progresses,\nwe start to get into digital video, right?\n\n303\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.790\nDigital video, again,\nmuch more efficient today.\n\n304\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.690\nAnd when we talk about digital video,\n\n305\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.720\nwe're talking about the second\npicture the diagram, or whatever.\n\n306\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.260\nThat is something known as\ndigital video interface.\n\n307\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.969\nI've heard a couple of different names\nof it, digital visual interface,\n\n308\n00:16:58.969 --> 00:16:59.958\ndigital video interface.\n\n309\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.193\nI'm not worried about that acronym for\nthe exam.\n\n310\n00:17:02.193 --> 00:17:05.920\nThat's just to know that\nit is a digital connection.\n\n311\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.190\nHowever, just when I said that,\nlike I've said before,\n\n312\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.200\njust as soon as we got\na compound of understanding,\n\n313\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.480\nI'm gonna throw a big old rock\nright in the middle of it.\n\n314\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.070\nBecause of the fact that analogue\nvideo was still so prevalent,\n\n315\n00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.460\nthey made some that would go DVI cables or\nconnections,\n\n316\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.540\nif you will, that would also\nconnect to analog video, right?\n\n317\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.775\nSo there are three different types of\nDVI connectors that I just want you to\n\n318\n00:17:28.775 --> 00:17:29.358\nbe aware of.\n\n319\n00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:33.003\nAnd again, this is kind of bridging\nthe gap between moving from analog,\n\n320\n00:17:33.003 --> 00:17:35.480\nmoving into our digital, right?\n\n321\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.278\nAnd there are DVI-I, DVI-D, and DVI-A,\n\n322\n00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:43.819\nin no particular order, right?\n\n323\n00:17:43.819 --> 00:17:46.800\nDVI-A, here's the way to\nremember it on the exam.\n\n324\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.882\nAnalog only, right, again,\nbecause analog was still very prevalent.\n\n325\n00:17:51.882 --> 00:17:53.282\nI mean we still have analog\nvideo out there today.\n\n326\n00:17:53.282 --> 00:17:57.320\nBut it was very prevalent in the time when\nthis connector was first implemented.\n\n327\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.145\nNow, it's analog only, though.\n\n328\n00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:04.050\nDVI-A doesn't support a digital signal,\nokay?\n\n329\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.580\nI also want you to remember some\npin outages on this one, all right?\n\n330\n00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.650\nIt's a 16 pin connector with\na single flat blade, all right?\n\n331\n00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.670\nAnd if we can take a look at our picture\nagain here, what I'm talking about,\n\n332\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.900\nthis is one that actually supports\nall the different form factors,\n\n333\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.680\nwhich is kinda good.\n\n334\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.570\nIt has this cross section, but that\nflat blade is all you would see there.\n\n335\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.150\n16 pin with a flat blade.\n\n336\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.255\nThat would be digital\nvideo interface analog.\n\n337\n00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:28.447\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess is what you would say\n\n338\n00:18:28.447 --> 00:18:29.960\nthe acronym, so DVI-A.\n\n339\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.926\n&gt;&gt; I could see your brain starting to\nsmoke for a second there, it's a lot.\n\n340\n00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:35.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat's right, that's right.\n\n341\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.964\nI'm pretty good with my acronyms.\n\n342\n00:18:36.964 --> 00:18:37.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are.\n&gt;&gt; But sometimes I\n\n343\n00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:41.800\ndefinitely fall short of the runway,\n[LAUGH] on this one.\n\n344\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.870\nNow the next one that we\nhave again is now kinda\n\n345\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.260\nbeing able to be used between analog and\nyour digital video.\n\n346\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.090\nAnd that's the DVI-I.\n\n347\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:54.880\nAnd that I just stands for integrated,\ndigital video interface integrated.\n\n348\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.030\nAnd again, I want you to keep in mind that\nthis is an analog and a digital connector.\n\n349\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.600\nAnd it is 22 pins.\n\n350\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.720\nAnd there are a couple of different\ntypes of DVI cables, if you will.\n\n351\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.340\nWe have what's known and single link and\nwe have what's known as dual link.\n\n352\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.064\nSingle link,\nit produces lower resolutions.\n\n353\n00:19:15.064 --> 00:19:18.330\nDual link,\nyou can pump more information over it.\n\n354\n00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.310\nSo, dual link is, again,\nyour digital side of things.\n\n355\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.922\nAnd you have a 22 pin with\na flat blade for single link.\n\n356\n00:19:26.922 --> 00:19:33.170\nYou also have 28 pin,\nFlat blade for the dual link.\n\n357\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.517\nAnd again, just think about digital video,\n\n358\n00:19:35.517 --> 00:19:39.296\nhigher resolutions that I can pump\nacross the dual link type interface.\n\n359\n00:19:39.296 --> 00:19:44.724\nAnd that leaves me with one of the more\ncommon ones that we see, as well.\n\n360\n00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:47.690\nAnd that's the DVI-D, and\nthat's an all-digital.\n\n361\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.394\nThat's when we're talking about DVI being\ntruly digital, no analog support at all.\n\n362\n00:19:52.394 --> 00:19:56.570\nAnd that is a 19 pin\nconnector with a flat blade.\n\n363\n00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.905\nNow that brings me into all-digital.\n\n364\n00:19:58.905 --> 00:20:00.062\nNo analog, no food for you.\n\n365\n00:20:00.062 --> 00:20:02.502\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding, no analog at all,\n\n366\n00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:04.800\nall right, and that's the HDMI.\n\n367\n00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.632\nHDMI is a proprietary interface.\n\n368\n00:20:06.632 --> 00:20:09.833\nAnd what I mean by that is that,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n369\n00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:15.046\nevery manufacturer that manufactures\nan HDMI technology has to pay royalties.\n\n370\n00:20:15.046 --> 00:20:18.150\nAnd I'm not exactly sure who\nowns the royalties to it.\n\n371\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.604\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; You do, You do?\n\n372\n00:20:19.604 --> 00:20:20.612\nOkay, so-\n&gt;&gt; Make your\n\n373\n00:20:20.612 --> 00:20:21.130\nchecks out to Daniel, [LAUGH].\n\n374\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.076\n&gt;&gt; Actually that's right,\n\n375\n00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:24.488\nwe're just gonna make Daniel's\nwallet a little bit fatter here.\n\n376\n00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:25.850\nAnd you can send all the hate mail to him.\n\n377\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:26.772\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just kidding, [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:20:26.772 --> 00:20:27.842\nThat's all right,\nit's all a joke, [LAUGH].\n\n379\n00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:31.800\n&gt;&gt; So HDMI, that's\nthe High-Definition Multimedia Interface.\n\n380\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.042\nNow this is a 19 pin connector.\n\n381\n00:20:34.042 --> 00:20:36.907\nAnd if we could take a look at it here,\nI do want you to know, again,\n\n382\n00:20:36.907 --> 00:20:37.948\nsome of the specifics.\n\n383\n00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.190\nKnow what it looks like.\n\n384\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.621\nThey might give you a question on the exam\nthat says, look at this exhibit and\n\n385\n00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:45.778\ntell us what type of connector it is.\n\n386\n00:20:45.778 --> 00:20:47.830\nAnd then you have\na multiple choice question.\n\n387\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.060\nAgain, I'm not sure if they will,\nbut they could.\n\n388\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.780\nAnd I want you to be able to recognize it.\n\n389\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.320\nNow, do I expect you to count 19 pins?\n\n390\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.383\nNot on your life.\nYou don't have to count 19 pins at all,\n\n391\n00:20:56.383 --> 00:20:57.420\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n392\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.420\nBut you do have to potentially\nhave to know it for the exam.\n\n393\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.950\nNow one of the great things about the HDMI\ninterface is that the cable itself\n\n394\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:14.650\ndoes support not only all-digital video,\nit also supports all digital audio.\n\n395\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.260\nAnd it only takes a single cable.\n\n396\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.870\nSee, some of these other interfaces,\nfor instance like VGA,\n\n397\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.490\nI have a VGA cable, that's my video.\n\n398\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.080\nGuess what, I also have a sound card that\nI use a one-eighth inch TRS jack to get\n\n399\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.612\nsound across.\n\n400\n00:21:26.612 --> 00:21:30.532\nAnd then same thing really\nwith digital video, that DVI.\n\n401\n00:21:30.532 --> 00:21:33.270\nThere's no audio that\ngoes over those cables.\n\n402\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:37.492\nHDMI, on the other hand,\nsupports digital audio and video.\n\n403\n00:21:37.492 --> 00:21:41.540\nAnd in the later standards also supports\nethernet network communications.\n\n404\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.587\nSo we're really talking bout a very,\nvery solid cable.\n\n405\n00:21:45.587 --> 00:21:49.192\nIt's got a lot of popularity,\nvery popular today in TV.\n\n406\n00:21:49.192 --> 00:21:53.410\nAs well as I couldn't count how many\nHDMI cables we have around here and\n\n407\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.500\nconnected to the various\ninterfaces that we have.\n\n408\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:02.202\nSo not only in the computing industry in\ngeneral, but also in your video, as well.\n\n409\n00:22:02.202 --> 00:22:06.886\nAll right, so\nnext thing they call out again is audio.\n\n410\n00:22:06.886 --> 00:22:11.753\nAll right, now when we talked about audio,\nthere are a couple different types\n\n411\n00:22:11.753 --> 00:22:14.730\nof connections that I\nwant you to be aware of.\n\n412\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.910\nAnd when we talk about audio, really,\nI'm talking about two different types.\n\n413\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.450\nAnd again, we got analog, we got digital.\n\n414\n00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.034\nOne of the digital types of audio,\nwe've already mentioned as HDMI.\n\n415\n00:22:25.736 --> 00:22:30.570\nBut I've got a couple of pictures here,\nand I've already mentioned one of these.\n\n416\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.497\nOne of them is the TRS jack, they call it.\n\n417\n00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:36.335\nAnd that's because of\nthis little tip here.\n\n418\n00:22:36.335 --> 00:22:38.015\nThey call it tipped ring sleeve,\nall right, so the TRS.\n\n419\n00:22:39.355 --> 00:22:41.045\nAnd it might just be\ncalled tipped sleeve too.\n\n420\n00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:43.270\nI've also seen them called TS jacks.\n\n421\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.121\nThese are one-eight inch jacks.\n\n422\n00:22:47.121 --> 00:22:50.143\nAnd guys and gals out there, I know some\nof you are probably in Europe out there.\n\n423\n00:22:50.143 --> 00:22:52.431\nAnd say, wait a second,\nwhat is this one-eight?\n\n424\n00:22:52.431 --> 00:22:53.887\nWell it's also 3.5 millimeter.\n\n425\n00:22:53.887 --> 00:22:57.023\nI don't know which one they\nmight ask you on the exam.\n\n426\n00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:58.460\nBut either way you'll be prepared.\n\n427\n00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:04.940\nSo it's either one-eighth inch jack or\nit is the 3.5 milimeter jack.\n\n428\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.236\nYou might see that they also have TRS\njacks in some of your audio connections\n\n429\n00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:10.922\nthat are quarter-inch, right,\nthe quarter-inch jack.\n\n430\n00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:13.010\nThis is one for your stereo headphones.\n\n431\n00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.848\nA lot bigger, but\nagain the concept is the same.\n\n432\n00:23:14.848 --> 00:23:17.800\nAnd that's where things\nlike adaptors come in.\n\n433\n00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.312\nThese are what connect to the integrated\nports on the back of your computer.\n\n434\n00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:25.574\nOr if you've got like one of those\nAudigy-type sound blaster cards right in\n\n435\n00:23:25.574 --> 00:23:29.040\nyour system,\nthis is what you'll connect to.\n\n436\n00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.860\nNow remember, we kinda mentioned in\nthe first episode, just very briefly,\n\n437\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.728\nthat you could see even optical\ncables connected to your PCs?\n\n438\n00:23:37.728 --> 00:23:41.976\nWell, this is really one of those that,\nit's out there.\n\n439\n00:23:41.976 --> 00:23:45.290\nAgain, this is an optical cable,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n440\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.728\nI remember it as S/PDIF, [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:49.205\nBut that's the Sony/Philips\ndigital interface.\n\n442\n00:23:49.205 --> 00:23:53.620\nAnd again, it is a digital audio signal.\n\n443\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.262\nOne last one that I'd like to mention that\nalso supports digital audio is display\n\n444\n00:23:58.262 --> 00:24:00.036\nport, and with display port,\n\n445\n00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:04.190\nthere are a few connections that\nwe'll talk about here as well.\n\n446\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.390\nYou'll see that this is a full sized\ndisplay port connection right here, and\n\n447\n00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.770\ndisplay port is a high resolution,\n\n448\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:16.810\nsupports very high resolution,\ndigital video and digital audio.\n\n449\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.960\nNow one of the good things,\nthe difference between display port and\n\n450\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.470\nHDMI is display port is royalty free.\n\n451\n00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.640\nHDMI isn't royalty free and\nevery manufacturer's gotta pay,\n\n452\n00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.980\nI don't know what the percentage is,\n\n453\n00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.570\na certain percentage to whoever\nit is that owns the royalties.\n\n454\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.890\nI should probably have that information,\nbut it's not relevant.\n\n455\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.190\nYeah it's not relevant to the exam at all.\n\n456\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.340\nNow you also have Mini-DisplayPort too.\n\n457\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.496\nIn fact Mini-DisplayPort is\nanother common technology as well.\n\n458\n00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:46.555\nAgain characteristics of DisplayPort\nare going to be the same,\n\n459\n00:24:46.555 --> 00:24:50.023\njust keep in mind that it is\na digital video interface.\n\n460\n00:24:50.023 --> 00:24:54.039\nAnd again, it supports very,\nvery high resolutions.\n\n461\n00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.310\nNow the other thing that we have as well\nthat they call out is what's know as\n\n462\n00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.470\nThunderbolt.\n\n463\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.870\nAnd I want you to really pay attention to\nthis Thunderbolt connection because, Dan,\n\n464\n00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.570\ncould you look at that connection.\n\n465\n00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.347\nThat's a Thunderbolt connection, right?\n\n466\n00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:07.612\n&gt;&gt; That's a Thunderbolt connection, yeah.\n\n467\n00:25:07.612 --> 00:25:11.840\n&gt;&gt; And the Mini-DisplayPort,\ncan you tell me any difference?\n\n468\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.920\n&gt;&gt; They're almost identical.\n\n469\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920\n&gt;&gt; They're almost identical,\n\n470\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.970\nthe only difference I can tell is one has\na square, and one has a lightning bolt!\n\n471\n00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:19.555\n&gt;&gt; Lightning bolt.\n\n472\n00:25:19.555 --> 00:25:23.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that's because\nwhen Thunderbolt first came out,\n\n473\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.720\nThunderbolt was invented by Apple and\nIntel.\n\n474\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.630\nWhen they first came out,\n\n475\n00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:32.300\nit was called Light Peak technology,\nand it blends portions of DisplayPort.\n\n476\n00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:38.319\nIn fact, Thunderbolt technologies\nare actually a type of DisplayPort\n\n477\n00:25:38.319 --> 00:25:43.560\nprotocol and it also uses\nthe PCI Express 2.0 connection.\n\n478\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.730\nNow, Thunderbolt's gone through some\ndifferent revisions, we have one, two and\n\n479\n00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.490\nwe're up to three now,\nthat I want you to keep in mind.\n\n480\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.240\nAnd it also supports, kind of like we\ntalked about USB to be a daisy chaining.\n\n481\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.660\nYou can have up to six devices that\nare connected to a Thunderbolt port.\n\n482\n00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.867\nAgain, the protocols that you\nsee are DisplayPort 1.1 and 2.0.\n\n483\n00:26:02.867 --> 00:26:06.570\nWhen we talk about Thunderbolt\n1.0 the very first revision.\n\n484\n00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.858\nNo one mentioned in standards, I don't\nknow if they're going to ask on the exam,\n\n485\n00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:14.670\nbut you will be thoroughly prepared\nif you can remember those features.\n\n486\n00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.685\nThe other thing I want you to know is\nthat the very first Thunderbolt standard\n\n487\n00:26:18.685 --> 00:26:22.420\nsupported 10 gigabit transfer\nspeeds over a single cable.\n\n488\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.870\nAnd that's one of the reasons I also said\nthat it's the successor to FireWire cuz\n\n489\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.010\nFireWire's amazing, no doubt about it.\n\n490\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.260\nAnd even USB has come up great.\n\n491\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.890\nThe USB 3.1, not on the exam,\nbut it's like 10 gigs.\n\n492\n00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.840\nThunderbolt's very first\nstandard supports 10 gigs.\n\n493\n00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.050\nSo it's a very,\nvery fast communication technology.\n\n494\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:45.690\nNow, I also want you to know that we have\nsome different Thunderbolt revisions.\n\n495\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.880\nI mentioned 1.1, we are up to 3.0 now.\n\n496\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.259\nSo, when we look at 2.0,\nI want you to understand that 2.0,\n\n497\n00:26:51.259 --> 00:26:54.765\n2.0 is a 20 gigabyte connection.\n\n498\n00:26:54.765 --> 00:26:59.985\nAll the characteristics, if you will,\nare the same, supports up to six devices.\n\n499\n00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:05.594\nAnd the difference here is that this\nis based off of the PCI BCI Express\n\n500\n00:27:05.594 --> 00:27:09.764\n2.0 Standard, as well as DisplayPort 1.2.\n\n501\n00:27:09.764 --> 00:27:12.557\nAll right, so you could see that it's\nusing both of those technologies.\n\n502\n00:27:12.557 --> 00:27:17.441\nThat's why in your expansion cards, we\ntalk about a Thunderbolt card connects to\n\n503\n00:27:17.441 --> 00:27:20.500\nthe PCI-E bus,\nagain because of its high speeds.\n\n504\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.790\nAnd we're talking 20 gigabit transfer\nspeed, so very, very fast connection.\n\n505\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.910\nAnd then, well, we don't stop there,\n\n506\n00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:33.030\nwe talk about Thunderbolt 3\nthat's out right now, and this is\n\n507\n00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:38.220\nabsolutely insane 40 gigabit transfer\nspeeds per second over single cable.\n\n508\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.360\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; That's smoking Wes.\n\n509\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n510\n00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.366\nCuz you think about, well why would\nI need something that's so fast?\n\n511\n00:27:42.366 --> 00:27:42.925\n&gt;&gt; Why wouldn't I?\n\n512\n00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:44.109\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why wouldn't I?\n\n513\n00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:47.050\nThat's right.\nLudicrous speed, go.\n\n514\n00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:48.555\nAnd here's the thing.\n\n515\n00:27:48.555 --> 00:27:54.838\n4,000K TVs out there, 4,000K video, 4K\nexcuse me that would be really big right.\n\n516\n00:27:54.838 --> 00:27:58.611\n4K resolution and\neven 8K resolution out there and\n\n517\n00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:03.592\nthe fact that we've got a lot of\nhigh definition, real beefy files.\n\n518\n00:28:03.592 --> 00:28:07.390\nYou can see that there's more of\na necessity to that not only can you pump\n\n519\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.020\nthat mount of resolution but\nyou get a very, very efficient speed.\n\n520\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.410\nYou get a very,\nvery good quality experience out of that,\n\n521\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.092\nbecause yeah,\nmaybe I can support DisplayPort.\n\n522\n00:28:17.092 --> 00:28:21.930\nDisplayPort supports a 4000k\nresolution but it might stutter and\n\n523\n00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.456\n[SOUND] sound like, so\nyou might see a break or a lag.\n\n524\n00:28:25.456 --> 00:28:29.309\nWhere something like this that just blows\nthe bandwidth wide open is gonna be\n\n525\n00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:32.610\nsomething that supports it really,\nreally efficiently.\n\n526\n00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.510\nSo those are your Thunberbolt connections.\n\n527\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.270\nThose are some of the connections that\nwe do want you to be aware of for\n\n528\n00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.430\nthe exam, but\nDan I know I've talked a lot here.\n\n529\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.108\nIt does look like we are going to work\non a small novel when it comes to PC\n\n530\n00:28:42.108 --> 00:28:42.724\nconnections.\n\n531\n00:28:42.724 --> 00:28:43.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n532\n00:28:43.803 --> 00:28:44.460\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n533\n00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.289\nIt could definitely fill a little library\ninside of your house if you were to print\n\n534\n00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:50.320\nall this out and put it on a shelf.\n\n535\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.790\nIt would be massive volumes.\n\n536\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.323\nSo be prepared,\ngrab your pencil and paper or\n\n537\n00:28:54.323 --> 00:28:58.999\nwhatever note taking device you have in\nfront of you because we're continuing on.\n\n538\n00:28:58.999 --> 00:29:02.540\nWe're gonna have to make a part\nthree on more connection types.\n\n539\n00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.860\nAs for this episode, we do thank you for\n\n540\n00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.660\nwatching, hopefully you've enjoyed it and\nare getting a lot out of it.\n\n541\n00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.830\nAs for this episode, though,\nwe need to sign off.\n\n542\n00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.300\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n543\n00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:11.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n544\n00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.679\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n545\n00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:20.493\n[MUSIC]\n\n546\n00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:23.756\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.084\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:13.856\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:17.080\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.390\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are back with more on our\n\n7\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.260\nA plus series, the 22901 that is and\nof course joining us in the studio yet\n\n8\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.490\nagain on more connections,\nour good friend Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.230\nWes, my man, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.906\n&gt;&gt; It's going all right.\n\n11\n00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:33.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One of these days, it will end, yes,\n\n12\n00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:33.820\nit will.\n\n13\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.608\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it will.\n\n14\n00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:35.325\nNo promises [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.959\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Dan's like don't lie to me man.\n\n16\n00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:40.070\n&gt;&gt; You're messing with\nmy emotions bro [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.324\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We do have a few more strings\n\n18\n00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:45.070\nif you will, shoelaces to tie off here.\n\n19\n00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.410\nSome of the things that we didn't\nget to in the first couple of parts.\n\n20\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.550\nKeep in mind, as you can see in\nour title this is a part three.\n\n21\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.960\nSo, with PC connections,\nthere are a whole bunch of them,\n\n22\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.250\nwhich necessitates the part three.\n\n23\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.210\nGo back and check out part one and\npart two, and\n\n24\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680\nthen come back here and we will get all of\nour connections pretty much rounded off.\n\n25\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.670\nNow, there are a couple of\ndifferent connections for\n\n26\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.750\nvideo that I did not mention in the first\ntwo parts, and kinda wanna double back on\n\n27\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.540\nthem to make sure that well, not\nexpressly called out on the exam, it does\n\n28\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.030\nfall under one of the objections in the\nfact we talk about analog video, right?\n\n29\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.380\nWe talked about analog video,\n\n30\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.270\nwe talked about digital video,analog,\nwe talked about VGA, right?\n\n31\n00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.000\nWe also talked about the DBIA and\nDBII, one most analog only,\n\n32\n00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.700\nDBIA DVI integrated, supports both\nanalog and the digital video.\n\n33\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.462\nThere are some other analog ones that\nwe wouldn't really being doing you much\n\n34\n00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:45.547\njustice if we didn't at\nleast mention them here.\n\n35\n00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:49.210\nSo, gotta couple of coaxial\ncables that we'd like to look at.\n\n36\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.330\nNow these connections have been around for\na very long time.\n\n37\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.200\nIn fact, some of these guys will probably\nremember some of your earlier video\n\n38\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.930\ngame consoles.\n\n39\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.120\nIn fact I think the XBox\n360 still allows you to use\n\n40\n00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.580\nthe one there on the left, right?\n\n41\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.080\nThese are,\nhave a couple different names and\n\n42\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.100\nwe're gonna make sure that you now both.\n\n43\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.420\nOne is called composite, right?\n\n44\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.310\nComposite is also known as RCA essentially\nfor the company that invented it.\n\n45\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.260\nYou can see that we have primarily,\n\n46\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.040\nthe yellow is going to be the video,\nagain, it is an analog video.\n\n47\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.590\nAnd then we have two separate audio,\nanalog audio channels on this as well.\n\n48\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.667\nYou typically have your right audio and\nleft audio.\n\n49\n00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.263\nSometimes you might see these as just\ntwo cables and that just means that it\n\n50\n00:02:33.263 --> 00:02:37.381\nisn't gonna be surround, right, it's gonna\nend up just being well not surround,\n\n51\n00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:40.687\nit's not gonna be dual if you will,\nstereo, sorry, forgetting,\n\n52\n00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:42.825\nit's not surround sound, just stereo.\n\n53\n00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.756\nSo if you see yellow and white,\n\n54\n00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:49.376\nwell that just means that you're gonna\nhave just a single sound, right.\n\n55\n00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:53.520\nYou'll have left,\nyou'll have right with the two cables.\n\n56\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.950\nNow we also have component.\n\n57\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.360\nComponent is also sometimes known\nas RGB for obvious reasons,\n\n58\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.990\nif you look at the colors in them,\nand you can see red, green, blue.\n\n59\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.565\nSo also know those as is another\nform of analog video as well, and\n\n60\n00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:11.428\nit's one of the things that like I said\ncomposite RCA if you will Component/RGB.\n\n61\n00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:15.373\nThey aren't expressly called out with\nthe inside of the objectives, but\n\n62\n00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:19.381\nwhat is called out as the difference\nbetween digital and analog video, and\n\n63\n00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:22.941\nwe don't want them to kinda slip\nthat one in under that category and\n\n64\n00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:26.035\nthen you not be prepared with it or\nfor them.\n\n65\n00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:30.565\nNow, in the very first part of this\nepisode, we were talking about USB, right?\n\n66\n00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:35.105\nAnd Daniel and I mentioned\nthe legendary printer port if you will,\n\n67\n00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:42.055\nthe type B connector that for a long time,\nwas the preferred connection to\n\n68\n00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:47.870\nconnect wired USB based\nprinters to your PCs.\n\n69\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.080\nNow, one of the things that\nhas changed in the fact, and\n\n70\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.200\nbecoming way more prevalent today is\nthe unbounded communications, right?\n\n71\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.830\nWhen we talk about a wired connection,\nwe're talking about bounded media.\n\n72\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.749\nBounded media usually comes in two forms,\nsome kind of copper based connection that\n\n73\n00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.460\nsends an electromagnetic energy across it,\nor optical connections, right?\n\n74\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.750\nLike our spit of connectors if you will,\nthe Sony,\n\n75\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.040\nPhillips digital interface which\nis an optical light source.\n\n76\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.470\nBut what is more and\nmore prevalent today is unbounded media,\n\n77\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.150\nmore specifically,\nradiated connections, right?\n\n78\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.549\nWhere we don't have the physical\nconstraints, right.\n\n79\n00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:26.025\nOr if we don't have the feasibility\n\n80\n00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:29.045\nbecause we need maybe\npositioning of a device in\n\n81\n00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:32.525\na location that doesn't make it feasible\nto have a wired connection right.\n\n82\n00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.745\nAnd that is wireless connections too.\n\n83\n00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:39.106\nNow, in our networking section we're\ngoing to talk about the specifics for\n\n84\n00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:40.274\na Wi-Fi standard.\n\n85\n00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:43.679\nBecause not only are they being used\nif you will just like printers, but\n\n86\n00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.567\nwe use them in network communication.\n\n87\n00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:50.571\nSo I am just briefly mention that,\nthere is a Wi-Fi status out there too and\n\n88\n00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:55.267\nformally I want you to know those\nare the IEEE 802.11 standard.\n\n89\n00:04:55.267 --> 00:05:00.344\nYou have A,B,G,and N and AC, but in our\nnetworking section, we're gonna really\n\n90\n00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:05.293\nbreak those down, and we'll look at the\nnuts and bolts of those specifications.\n\n91\n00:05:05.293 --> 00:05:07.251\nSo, understand that I mentioned them here,\nbut\n\n92\n00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:09.340\nthey're included in our network section.\n\n93\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.010\nHowever, some of the other unbounded\nconnections, wireless connections that we\n\n94\n00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.600\nhave inside of our PCs today\nare things like Bluetooth.\n\n95\n00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.090\nBluetooth has been around for\na good long while now.\n\n96\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.010\nBluetooth is actually,\n\n97\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.100\nit had temporarily an IEEE specification\nbehind it and I want you to know,\n\n98\n00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.020\nwe talked about the Institute for\nElectrical and Electronic Engineers,\n\n99\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.160\nthey are a Standards body that\npromotes electrical communications,\n\n100\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.600\ntelecommunications and\nelectrical sciences.\n\n101\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.740\nA lot of things that they actually promote\nif you look as far as standards go.\n\n102\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.380\nWhen Bluetooth first came out,\n\n103\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.618\nthey did standardize it under something\nknown as the 802.15.1 standard.\n\n104\n00:05:48.618 --> 00:05:53.633\nHowever, they kinda diverge from that,\nin what they did is, the IEEE,\n\n105\n00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:57.909\nmuch the same way PCIE today is\nunder what's known as PCI SIG,\n\n106\n00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.047\nthe special interest group\nthat basically oversees that.\n\n107\n00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:06.116\nUSB is now under something known as\nthe USB SIG or special interest group,\n\n108\n00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:10.330\nthey're the ones that keep promoting\nthe standards and the technologies.\n\n109\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.120\nWell Bluetooth today is also got\nBluetooth SIG if you will, it's a special\n\n110\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.690\ninterest group and they're the ones\nthat maintain as opposed to the IEEE.\n\n111\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.300\nSo what is Bluetooth for us?\n\n112\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.720\nBluetooth is a very simplistic\ncommunication, it's very easy to set up.\n\n113\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.650\nOne of the great things about Bluetooth\nis the fact that it doesn't take a lot\n\n114\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.439\nof technical know how in order\nto make a connection to a PC.\n\n115\n00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.120\nIt doesn't matter if it's a wireless\nBluetooth based printer, if you will,\n\n116\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.230\nif it's a Bluetooth Earbud, right?\n\n117\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.525\nBut Bluetooth is a very,\nvery simplistic communication type.\n\n118\n00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:45.229\nAnd when I say that,\n\n119\n00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.520\nI'm certainly not demeaning\nanybody that was using Bluetooth.\n\n120\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.490\nThat's not what I mean.\n\n121\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.370\nWe're not having a Nick Barnes episode\nwhere it says step away from the computer.\n\n122\n00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.900\nThis is a lot more simplistic\nthan you're making it.\n\n123\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.580\nIt's one of the great things\nabout Bluetooth, right?\n\n124\n00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.950\nYou turn on the adaptor, and you turn on\nBluetooth on whatever the device is and\n\n125\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.330\nthey make connections, right.\n\n126\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.768\nAnd they enter this pairing,\nthey pair up together.\n\n127\n00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:10.944\nThe pairing, if you will, is a trust\nrelationship that these two devices enter\n\n128\n00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:14.870\ninto, they communicate, and now,\nyou can send data across them.\n\n129\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.890\n&gt;&gt; Bluetooth has been really good about\njust making wireless connections just\n\n130\n00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.980\nabout anywhere available, right.\n\n131\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.265\nYou go inside your car, and your phone can\nconnect to your car stereo system, and\n\n132\n00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:28.856\nyou can make calls, listen to\nthe audio that you have on your phone,\n\n133\n00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:32.221\nmaybe you have some podcast or\nsomething I'm gonna listen to.\n\n134\n00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:33.760\nAnd automatically I'll\nmake that connection.\n\n135\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.440\nAs soon as they see each other,\nit'll pair up\n\n136\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.450\nafter you've made the initial connection\nwith the whole pairing thing.\n\n137\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.709\n[CROSSTALK] Once that's done though,\nthis stuff is so easy and so simple.\n\n138\n00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:43.940\nGreat range.\n\n139\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n140\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n141\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.012\n&gt;&gt; The throughput,\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, the very first,\n\n142\n00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:49.376\nthey got different class devices and\n\n143\n00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:51.799\nI don't think they're gonna test\nyou on the different classes.\n\n144\n00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:57.165\nThe devices common class is 10 meters,\nwe're talking about 32.8 feet, all right.\n\n145\n00:07:57.165 --> 00:07:59.890\nNow You say, wow,\nthat was really specific, Wes.\n\n146\n00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.793\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know which one they're gonna\n\n147\n00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:02.980\ngive you when it comes down to it.\n\n148\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.450\nI want you to remember that\n10 meters is 32.8 feet.\n\n149\n00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.771\nAnd I don't know if they're gonna say,\nhey, it's 10 meters or how many feet.\n\n150\n00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:13.095\nSo if they ask you on the exam and\nthey're not that specific, they might say,\n\n151\n00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:17.000\nwhat's in the range of 30 to 35 feet,\nyou're perfect, that's Bluetooth, right?\n\n152\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.990\nIf they say 10 meters,\nthen either way you will be covered.\n\n153\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.820\nAnd like Dan says, it's such\na commonality, and it's really so\n\n154\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.430\nsimple today.\n\n155\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.970\nNow I will tell you that something that\nyou got to keep in mind in Bluetooth.\n\n156\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.740\nIs occasionally, for security purposes,\n\n157\n00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.920\nand every manufacture will implement it\na little bit different, you might end up\n\n158\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.880\nhaving to enter whats known as\na personal identification number, a PIN.\n\n159\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.724\nThat just says you turn the device on and\nthey see each other and before they\n\n160\n00:08:41.724 --> 00:08:46.126\nactually enter this trust relationship\nwhere they start communicating, it says,\n\n161\n00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:47.372\nenter the PIN, right?\n\n162\n00:08:47.372 --> 00:08:50.632\nSo a lot of times manufacturers even\ndefault the things like four 0s,\n\n163\n00:08:50.632 --> 00:08:54.128\nwhich really is kind of like the lack\nof a PIN, if you really think about it.\n\n164\n00:08:54.128 --> 00:08:56.910\nAnd that allows them to\nfinish this communication.\n\n165\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.190\nNow in the past, Bluetooth,\n\n166\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.230\none of the things that it's been very,\nvery bad about is power consumption.\n\n167\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.540\nAnd the reason that is, is because while\nit's very, very convenient, in previous\n\n168\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.250\nBluetooth specifications, I believe were\nup to 4.0, now we might even be pass that.\n\n169\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.280\nBut I believe at the time\nof this recording,\n\n170\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.490\n2017, we're up to Bluetooth 4.0.\n\n171\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.130\nIn past specifications,\n\n172\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.350\none of the things that Bluetooth\nrequired was not only a pairing up.\n\n173\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.870\nBut once the devices are paired in\nthe background, unbeknownst to you,\n\n174\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.488\nit's the underlying technology,\nthey keep re-pairing.\n\n175\n00:09:29.488 --> 00:09:32.730\nAnd re-pairing is not fixing anything,\nbut I mean pairing,\n\n176\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.830\nas in the pairing process of\nmaking the connection together.\n\n177\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.015\nAnd they keep doing that process\ntemporarily, just on and\n\n178\n00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:40.315\noff in the background.\n\n179\n00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:43.216\nAnd the problem with that\nis it's very power hungry,\n\n180\n00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:44.900\nit takes a lot of your battery.\n\n181\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.280\nSo one of the thing you've heard in the\npast, if you have Bluetooth in a device,\n\n182\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.280\nand you're not using it, turn it off.\n\n183\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.670\nToday not so much,\nI'd say if you're not using the device,\n\n184\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.550\nI've got somebody over here that\nunderstands hacking in devices.\n\n185\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.990\nYou won't want somebody like Dan\npotentially exploiting the Bluetooth.\n\n186\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.370\nJust kidding Dan, I had to pick\non you there to make that work.\n\n187\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.370\n&gt;&gt; He totally wants me\nexploiting your Bluetooth.\n\n188\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.909\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so I would say the more\n\n189\n00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:10.308\nmodern Bluetooth, when 4.0 came out,\none of the great things is,\n\n190\n00:10:10.308 --> 00:10:14.470\nis it's really a revision of the Bluetooth\nstandard that is a low powered Bluetooth.\n\n191\n00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.400\nIt's one of the first times that we\nsee that Bluetooth isn't power hungry.\n\n192\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.130\nIn fact,\nwhen it first came back out on the market,\n\n193\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.230\nI wanna say it's quite a few years now,\nthree years or so.\n\n194\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.560\nBut when it first came out on the market,\nthey were kinda raving about the fact that\n\n195\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.740\nyour Bluetooth device could be powered\non a battery that is less than the size\n\n196\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.990\nof a dime, and\nthe battery would last for ten years.\n\n197\n00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.745\nBasically saying, if you look what\nit's in today, things like ear buds,\n\n198\n00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:36.982\nthings like our phones, right?\n\n199\n00:10:36.982 --> 00:10:41.253\nHow many of you really keep your phone\npast three years if you're unlucky to get\n\n200\n00:10:41.253 --> 00:10:44.371\na contract that you have to be in for\nthree years, right?\n\n201\n00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:48.845\nSo what they really say today is the\nbatteries that power the Bluetooth devices\n\n202\n00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:50.760\nwill outlast the device itself.\n\n203\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.538\nSo you can see that that's really great.\n\n204\n00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:56.453\nAnd the other good thing about the newer\nBluetooth specifications is that it\n\n205\n00:10:56.453 --> 00:10:59.278\ndoesn't have to go to\nthe pairing-up process again.\n\n206\n00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:00.527\nOne's the master device or\n\n207\n00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.837\nthe primary device that controls all\nthe devices that can connect to it,\n\n208\n00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:08.270\nit's up to eight devices, seven devices if\nyou will, including the primary device.\n\n209\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.050\nIs that they can form this relationship,\nand the primary device can actually shut\n\n210\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.850\nall the other devices down, and\nput them in a low-powered state.\n\n211\n00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.290\nAnd then when they come back on,\nthey're already paired up.\n\n212\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.830\nSo it's really,\nreally power efficient today.\n\n213\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.750\nHowever, we do wanna know some of\nthe facts about Bluetooth as well.\n\n214\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.090\nIt operates frequencies wise,\nfrequencies are important, right?\n\n215\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.495\nAnd again WiFi, we'll talk about\n2.4 gigahertz frequency and\n\n216\n00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:32.840\n5 gigahertz frequency.\n\n217\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.890\nBut for Bluetooth in this series,\n\n218\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.059\nI want you to know that we're talking\nabout the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n219\n00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:41.410\nNow if you If you guys are just\ngetting in to technology,\n\n220\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.360\nyou might not be aware of\nwhat that spectrum is.\n\n221\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.250\nThat's called ISM band,\nthat's the industrial, scientifical, and\n\n222\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.840\nmedical band.\n\n223\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.726\nIt's an unlicensed band, it was released\nquite a long time ago by the FCC.\n\n224\n00:11:52.726 --> 00:11:58.030\nThis is what certain cordless phones use,\nwe use it in our WiFi communications.\n\n225\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.210\nAgain, it's an unregulated band,\nunlicensed band that people can use.\n\n226\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.187\n&gt;&gt; My favorite fact about Bluetooth\nis that you can create a piconet.\n\n227\n00:12:05.187 --> 00:12:05.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n228\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.240\n&gt;&gt; I just thought it sounds spicy.\n\n229\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.190\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n230\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.680\n&gt;&gt; It's just a small network of\nBluetooth-connected devices.\n\n231\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.030\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n232\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.650\nWhen you've got one primary device that\nis controlling up to those eight devices,\n\n233\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.260\nthat's exactly what,\npiconet just like Dan said.\n\n234\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.340\nWhat's kinda interesting is that the major\ndevice that controls all those eight\n\n235\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.940\ndevices can actually be\ncontrolled by other devices.\n\n236\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.980\nSo you get multiple piconets become\nwhat's known as a scatternet.\n\n237\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.565\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n238\n00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:34.617\n&gt;&gt; And they go to an election\nprocess where the master device, and\n\n239\n00:12:34.617 --> 00:12:35.870\nI don't really like that term.\n\n240\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.670\nBut the primary device that controls all\nthe secondary devices that are connected\n\n241\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.520\nto it, can now go through an election\nprocess to the other primary devices.\n\n242\n00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.800\nAnd now we have a mass and\nit's called scatternet.\n\n243\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.452\nSmaller eight devices, piconet.\n\n244\n00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:53.700\nMultiple piconets form a scatter net, so\nkind of an interesting technology there.\n\n245\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.640\nSo we've talked a little\nbit about the range, right?\n\n246\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.650\nAgain, the range, the distance\nlimitation of that, if you will,\n\n247\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.550\nis going to be essentially 10 meters.\n\n248\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.907\nYou do have other class devices\nthat go up a lot farther than that.\n\n249\n00:13:06.907 --> 00:13:09.850\nIn fact, they've got some classes,\nif you will, that go up to 100 meters.\n\n250\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.580\nThe most common ones that we use\ninside of our just basic connections,\n\n251\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.638\nare really that 10 meter or 32.8 feet.\n\n252\n00:13:17.638 --> 00:13:21.308\nLet's see, so\nlet's talk about transfer speeds, right?\n\n253\n00:13:21.308 --> 00:13:26.601\nWhen we talk about data transfer speeds,\nBluetooth 2.0,\n\n254\n00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:30.710\n3.0, actually, we'll go back to 1.0.\n\n255\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:31.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go way back in time, right, 1.0.\n\n256\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.030\n&gt;&gt; Let's start at the beginning, right?\n\n257\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's start at the beginning,\nthat's a good place to start.\n\n258\n00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:37.183\n&gt;&gt; In the beginning\nthere was Bluetooth 1.0.\n\n259\n00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.545\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n260\n00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:40.780\nthat standard was 1\nmegabit transfer speeds.\n\n261\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.682\nAnd it was actually broken into two\nchannels, you had what was known as\n\n262\n00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:48.140\na voice channel, and\nyou had what's known as a data channel.\n\n263\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.234\nThe voice channel would be,\nI think it was 232k,\n\n264\n00:13:51.234 --> 00:13:55.540\nkilobits per second, you might say\nwell that's not a lot of bandwidth.\n\n265\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.960\nBut it doesn't really take much\nbandwidth for an audio communication.\n\n266\n00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.607\nData transfer would allow more bandwidth,\nI think it's 768k for\n\n267\n00:14:03.607 --> 00:14:07.302\nan overall bandwidth of one\nmegabit transfer speeds.\n\n268\n00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:12.530\nHowever, when you get into 2.0 and 3.0,\nwe're talking about 25 times the speed.\n\n269\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.155\nWe're talking about 25 megabit\ntransfer speeds, and even for\n\n270\n00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:21.290\n4.0 today, the range,\nthe transfer speeds stay the same.\n\n271\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.820\nBut 4.0 can go up to 60 meters.\n\n272\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.082\nSo you're talking about a potential,\nagain,\n\n273\n00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:29.306\nany wireless communication has\nseveral contributing factors that\n\n274\n00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:31.920\ncan severely diminish\nthe overall distance, right?\n\n275\n00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.392\nIf we have interference, you have other\ndevices that are in that range of the 2.4\n\n276\n00:14:35.392 --> 00:14:38.384\ngigahertz frequency, they're going\nto cause interference as well.\n\n277\n00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:41.390\nSo it can greatly limit what\nare the overall ranges.\n\n278\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.820\nAnd just like any other device that we've\ntalked about, it's all theoretical, right?\n\n279\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.608\nIt's all theory, if you will,\nit's all fun and\n\n280\n00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:48.185\ngames until you put it into practicality.\n\n281\n00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:49.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you don't see something that's\n\n282\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.390\neven close to that.\n\n283\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.936\nBut you do kind of have to know that for\nthe exam.\n\n284\n00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:56.031\nNow this is kinda interesting, Dan and\n\n285\n00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:59.534\nI were having a conversation before\nstarted live on recorded TV.\n\n286\n00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:02.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Before we\nstarted recording this episode,\n\n287\n00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:05.840\nwe were talking about back in\nour days as kids, way back when.\n\n288\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.580\nWe were talking about laser tag, right?\n\n289\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.624\nAnd the old laser tag, and\nI couldn't remember and Dan reminded me,\n\n290\n00:15:10.624 --> 00:15:11.790\nit was infrared, right?\n\n291\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.980\nSo that's another technology that's out\nthere, and you still have it built into\n\n292\n00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.595\nyour systems, you still have\noperating systems that recognize it.\n\n293\n00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:22.560\nAndroid's got it built into their\noperating system where you can do infrared\n\n294\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.860\ndata transfers and stuff,\nso it is kinda interesting.\n\n295\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.280\n&gt;&gt; I know it's cool, I can use my\nsmartphone to control my television.\n\n296\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.580\n&gt;&gt; There you go, great example.\n\n297\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.270\nAnd that's one of the most\ncommon implementations of IR.\n\n298\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.100\nWe used it to call it the box,\nright, because in the early days,\n\n299\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.700\nthose remote controls,\nthey were the size of a box, right?\n\n300\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.360\nBut so do know IR,\nit's a very short range transmission.\n\n301\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.760\nAnd if you ever hear the term LOS\ntransmission, it's just another acronym,\n\n302\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.770\nladies and gentlemen,\njust means line of sight.\n\n303\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.670\nIt's a extremely finicky\nline of sight communication.\n\n304\n00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.705\nSo Dan, I know you've got kids, and\n\n305\n00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:57.132\nI'm sure at one point maybe your\nkid jumps in front of that TV.\n\n306\n00:15:57.132 --> 00:16:00.374\nAnd gotta see what the cartoon is,\nright, that they're watching.\n\n307\n00:16:00.374 --> 00:16:04.152\nAnd you go try to change the channel,\nand you're like hold on, move,\n\n308\n00:16:04.152 --> 00:16:06.404\nI know this happens all\nthe way to my kids.\n\n309\n00:16:06.404 --> 00:16:08.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this happens all the time.\nMy daughter loves to stack things in front\n\n310\n00:16:08.838 --> 00:16:10.645\nof the little IR receiver on the TV.\n\n311\n00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:13.260\nThere's something always\nblocking that thing.\n\n312\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.930\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens with my son, my\nson just like when something comes on and\n\n313\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.274\nhe's like I'll post up right in front\nof everybody in the [CROSSTALK].\n\n314\n00:16:20.274 --> 00:16:23.937\nAnd that kinda shows you what we're\ntalking about when we say line of sight,\n\n315\n00:16:23.937 --> 00:16:24.980\nLOS communication.\n\n316\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.050\nAgain, satellite is a line\nof sight communication.\n\n317\n00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.992\nThe difference is, its line of sight\nis the curvature of the Earth, right?\n\n318\n00:16:29.992 --> 00:16:34.260\n[LAUGH] So a lot a greater distance here,\nbut do know that.\n\n319\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.470\nThe infrared standard what\nwe commonly use today and\n\n320\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.540\nit definitely had some high speed\nadvantages as well, it was called VFIR.\n\n321\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.000\nThis is how I remember it, VFIR,\nit's Very Fast Infrared and\n\n322\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.180\nthat was 16 Mb transfer speed.\n\n323\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.630\nSo I want you to understand that\neven though it's an old technology,\n\n324\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.508\nlook at the very first Bluetooth,\nvery simplistic, very nice connection.\n\n325\n00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:59.340\nThat's 1 megabit, we're talking about\n16 times the speed, so it is out there.\n\n326\n00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.250\nThe other thing I would like you\njust briefly remember about infrared\n\n327\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.890\nis that it is, when we say short range\nwe're talking about three or four feet.\n\n328\n00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.012\nNothing really more than that,\n\n329\n00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:10.350\nI'm sure Dan you've probably maybe\ntried to control the remote.\n\n330\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.694\nYou go in the other bedroom or\n\n331\n00:17:11.694 --> 00:17:15.010\nyou go in your kitchen, and\nyou go, wow, it's not working.\n\n332\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.214\nAgain, very very short distances,\nso do remember that.\n\n333\n00:17:18.214 --> 00:17:21.974\nThe other thing I would like\nyou to know is the acronym for\n\n334\n00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:27.030\nassociation that oversees infrared\nstandards, and they are the IRDA.\n\n335\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.600\nNo, we're not talking\nabout a food association,\n\n336\n00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.220\nthat's the USDA, we're talking about\nIRDA Infrared Data Association they're\n\n337\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.270\nthe ones that oversee the standards.\n\n338\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.198\nOne last thing when it comes to wireless\ncommunications it's very prevalent today\n\n339\n00:17:42.198 --> 00:17:43.602\nis NFC Near Field Communications.\n\n340\n00:17:43.602 --> 00:17:47.622\nWe have all types of different near\nfield communications out there but\n\n341\n00:17:47.622 --> 00:17:51.027\nspecifically the NFC standard\nif you will allows devices to\n\n342\n00:17:51.027 --> 00:17:54.675\ncommunicate by bringing them\nwithin inches of each other.\n\n343\n00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:57.209\nDoing data transfers,\nI know that you've got an Android device,\n\n344\n00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.215\nI have an Android device.\n\n345\n00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:01.377\nAnd if I had to say, hey you know\nDan I got this picture of this\n\n346\n00:18:01.377 --> 00:18:03.970\nknife you just gotta have,\nyou gotta see it.\n\n347\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.320\nWell I could show him or\nwe could do NFC and\n\n348\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.210\nwe could touch the devices together and\nwe can end up transferring files that way.\n\n349\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.037\nYou also have things like bill pay,\nthat's another thing it's been coming.\n\n350\n00:18:13.037 --> 00:18:18.008\nContact-less payment systems that you've\nprobably seen maybe as an option to your\n\n351\n00:18:18.008 --> 00:18:22.418\npoint of sale systems where we can\nactually touch your phone to the device,\n\n352\n00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:24.041\nthe point of sales system.\n\n353\n00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:27.398\nAnd it does a near field communication\npayment that's called contact-less\n\n354\n00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.180\npayment system.\n\n355\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.170\nSo they are there, keep in mind that it is\nanother one of those things that if you\n\n356\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.440\nhave turned on in your device and\nyou're not aware of it.\n\n357\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.405\nThat coupled with Bluetooth, even being\nlow-powered, and you have WiFi turned on,\n\n358\n00:18:39.405 --> 00:18:41.813\nyou can start to see a little\nbit of power loss there.\n\n359\n00:18:41.813 --> 00:18:43.080\nSo just pay attention to it.\n\n360\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.600\nBut it is a great thing to have.\n\n361\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.120\nBut, like we talk about, and\nwe will briefly mention in later episodes,\n\n362\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.620\njust briefly,\nabout a high level overview of security.\n\n363\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.170\nKeep in mind any connection that you\nhave turned on that you're not using\n\n364\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.790\ncould potentially be\na security vulnerability.\n\n365\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.810\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n366\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.980\nLast but not least some of the things\nthat they've call out are adapters.\n\n367\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.489\nAnd all these connections that we've\ntalked about there is sometimes\n\n368\n00:19:07.489 --> 00:19:08.219\na limiting factor.\n\n369\n00:19:08.219 --> 00:19:10.833\nAnd the fact that I look\nat the back of my computer,\n\n370\n00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:13.944\nI look at the front of my computer,\na laptop if you will, and\n\n371\n00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:16.870\nwe use a certain kind of connection but\nunfortunately,\n\n372\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.570\nthe cable that I wanna connect it\nto isn't that type of cable, right?\n\n373\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.500\nSo one of the things that they call out\nare some different types of adapters.\n\n374\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.890\nSome of those that they call out?\n\n375\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.400\nThey call out a DVI to VGA.\n\n376\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.570\nIn the time that DVI was coming out,\nVGA was still very, very prevalent.\n\n377\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:40.750\nAnd you might need to connect a DVI\nconnector to a VGA-based monitor.\n\n378\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.621\nWell you have adapters for that and that's\nwhat allows you that interoperability or\n\n379\n00:19:45.621 --> 00:19:47.610\nthat interconnection.\n\n380\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.410\nToday, we have things like Thunderbolt.\n\n381\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.890\nThunderbolt to DVI is one of those type of\nconnections that you might have to make.\n\n382\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.581\nIn the days of the first ATX boards,\n\n383\n00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:58.981\nwe talked about a PS2 connector being\nthe six pin Mini-DIN connector,\n\n384\n00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:03.160\nit's usually green and purple, if you\nwill, for the keyboard and the mouse.\n\n385\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.720\nWell, guess what?\n\n386\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.500\nWhat if you had a USB connector,\nbut you didn't have USB ports,\n\n387\n00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:13.720\nyou only had a PS2 port on\nthe back of your computer.\n\n388\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.460\nWell, they also have USB\nto PS2 connectors as well.\n\n389\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.055\nWe also use this inside of\nthe KVMs that keyboard video\n\n390\n00:20:19.055 --> 00:20:22.200\nmonitors,that would allow us to\nconnect to multiple devices through\n\n391\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.130\na single box interface that\nyou can see these, too.\n\n392\n00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.820\nYou also have things like for instance,\n\n393\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.270\nHDMI to VGA, as well as, and\nI think that's pretty much it.\n\n394\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.793\nThere are all different kinds out there.\n\n395\n00:20:33.793 --> 00:20:38.624\nWe have Ethernet, you have for instance\nyou have things like Thunderbolt to\n\n396\n00:20:38.624 --> 00:20:42.420\nEthernet, USB to Ethernet as well,\nHDMI to display port.\n\n397\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.780\nIn fact, we got some as an example here,\n\n398\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.860\nI've actually got a few of\nthese here that you can see.\n\n399\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.260\nSo for instance, and\nagain they're all different kinds,\n\n400\n00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.380\nlike this is an HDMI connector here.\n\n401\n00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.100\nIf we can kind of zoom in you'll see that\nthis is actually a different type of\n\n402\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.200\nHDMI connector.\n\n403\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.900\nYou can see HDMI, I think it's\na micro-HDMI connector right there,\n\n404\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.170\nthey also have a mini as well,\nit's just slightly bigger than this.\n\n405\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.050\nRemember we talked about network adapters,\nright?\n\n406\n00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.119\nWell, this is a USB,\nthat's a Type A connector right there.\n\n407\n00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:11.478\nAnd if I've got a USB port but\nI don't have an Ethernet adapter and\n\n408\n00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:15.480\nI need to make a wired connection,\nwell I can do that as well.\n\n409\n00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.290\nLet's see, what else?\n\n410\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.928\nHere's an HDMI, we talked about\nHDMI to DVI, well there you go.\n\n411\n00:21:19.928 --> 00:21:23.310\nThat's an adapter and again, it allows you\nthe interoperability when the connections\n\n412\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.100\nthemselves, the interfaces,\nyou don't have access to.\n\n413\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.960\nYou can see this is another anchor here.\n\n414\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.810\nAnd this anchor is actually,\n\n415\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.420\nlet me get that in the camera here,\nthis is kind of interesting.\n\n416\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.410\nIt gives you a chance too to see\nwhen we talked about, Dan and\n\n417\n00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:41.150\nI mentioned in earlier episodes the\ndifference between a 2.0 USB and the 3.0.\n\n418\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.610\nThat's right, notice that blue blade\nthere lets us known right away.\n\n419\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.810\nIt's got kind of an ingenious design\nthere, just simply color-coding that so\n\n420\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:54.900\nyou can see that,\nthat is USB 3.0 to an Ethernet port there.\n\n421\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.610\nYour RJ-45 jack that will definitely get\ninto and break down a little bit more of\n\n422\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:04.670\nwhat's going on with those pins, sometimes\nalso called an 8P8C connector as well.\n\n423\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.020\nThunderbolt, right, so\nwe have Thunderbolt.\n\n424\n00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.030\nThunderbolt also connects\nto video as well,\n\n425\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.900\nthis just happens to be a Thunderbolt.\n\n426\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.380\nAnd, kind of like we were joking about in\nthe last episode, Dan, the only reason I\n\n427\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.060\ncan tell that that's not a mini-display\nport is because it has a lightning bolt.\n\n428\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.673\n&gt;&gt; And it costs six times as much.\n\n429\n00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:19.596\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right exactly.\n\n430\n00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:21.959\n[LAUGH] It costs $60, but\n\n431\n00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:27.310\nyou can see that this is display\nport to Ethernet, likewise.\n\n432\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:32.720\nSo these are some of the ports that\nyou have to keep in mind, or some of\n\n433\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.340\nthe adapters, if you will, that you have\nto keep in mind when it comes to the exam.\n\n434\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.753\n&gt;&gt; Wow Wes, we got a laundry list of\ndifferent types of adapters you have\n\n435\n00:22:39.753 --> 00:22:40.471\nsitting over here.\n\n436\n00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:44.480\nAre there any others that we have to know\nabout that are specific to the A+ exam?\n\n437\n00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.977\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for the A+ exam there is one more\nthat I kinda gotta remember and that's\n\n438\n00:22:48.977 --> 00:22:55.230\nthe USB-A to USB-B adapter as well that\nyou might have to sometimes implement.\n\n439\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:00.660\nNot specific to the exam I might say\nwhat they say a gender bender type\n\n440\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.540\nadapter and what that does is just\nchanges a female adapter into a male, or\n\n441\n00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.030\na male to a female.\n\n442\n00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.990\nAnd sometimes that happens because\nof the fact that you might see that\n\n443\n00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.090\na port that you need to plug into,\nyou don't have the right gender.\n\n444\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.560\nAnd what you can do is you put a small\nadapter on it and you can plug it in,\n\n445\n00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.900\nbecause the interface in\nthe connection is the same.\n\n446\n00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.410\nIt's just which end of\nthe river are you on.\n\n447\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.930\nYou might even see those where\nthey go male to females as well.\n\n448\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.670\nFor the most part, those are going\nto be some of the adapters.\n\n449\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.740\nKeep in mind, guys,\nthere are plenty more that are out there.\n\n450\n00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.023\nWe've got a whole bunch here that we use\nat ITProTV, but those are the specifics.\n\n451\n00:23:35.023 --> 00:23:37.700\nIf I could specifically say that,\nfor the 229-01 Exam.\n\n452\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.930\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, well thank you for\n\n453\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.700\nwalking us through all these different\nconnectors that we have to worry about\n\n454\n00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.000\nwhen it comes to our exam.\n\n455\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.700\nAs you can see you've got your\nhomework set forth ahead of you.\n\n456\n00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.514\nSo go forth, make your flash cards,\ntake pictures,\n\n457\n00:23:48.514 --> 00:23:52.765\ndo whatever it takes to bury these things\nin your head, all the specifications,\n\n458\n00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:56.720\ncable lengths, connector types,\nyou name it, there's a laundry list.\n\n459\n00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.000\nSo go over them as many times as necessary\ntil it's buried in that brain of yours.\n\n460\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.400\nBut, that being said, whew,\nright, we're done with those.\n\n461\n00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.440\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n462\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.600\nWe're at the end of our episode.\n\n463\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.120\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n464\n00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n465\n00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:11.870\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n466\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:19.321\n[MUSIC]\n\n467\n00:24:19.321 --> 00:24:20.929\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.006\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:15.791\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.673\nI'm your host Zach Memos for CompTIA A+.\n\n7\n00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:22.699\nAnd we are gonna be looking at power\nsupplies today with our IT expert\n\n8\n00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.970\nWes Bryan, he's agreed to join us.\n\n9\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.180\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.600\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, how you doing, Zach?\n\n11\n00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.041\n&gt;&gt; Great, great.\n&gt;&gt; It is great to be back here in\n\n12\n00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:29.640\nthe studios.\n\n13\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.309\nThat's right,\n\n14\n00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.430\nwe're gonna be looking at one of\nthe major system components today, right.\n\n15\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.470\nWe have the system unit and\nwe've got many different components.\n\n16\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.622\nWe talk about things like the motherboard\nbeing really the spine of the whole\n\n17\n00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.650\noperation that connects\neverything together.\n\n18\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.639\nWe talk about the CPU, right, the CPU\nbeing the brains of the operation and\n\n19\n00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.757\nthe hard drive being that container where\nwe store all of the information that\n\n20\n00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:50.980\nwe're working with.\n\n21\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.168\nWe talk about RAM being\nthe temporary workbench for\n\n22\n00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:58.230\nyour information that\nyou're currently using.\n\n23\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.626\nBut what is it that powers\nthe whole entire operation, so\n\n24\n00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:03.690\nthis is where power units come in.\n\n25\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.460\nSo let's go ahead and, A+ is never without\nany acronyms, right, so let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.020\nwe'll feed you some\nalphabet soup right away.\n\n27\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.020\nPSU, that's the power supply unit, it's\na very, very important component, right,\n\n28\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.440\nbecause it's really what\npowers the whole operation.\n\n29\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.220\nWe can have all of these components but if\nwe don't have a power supply we don't have\n\n30\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.270\nanything, so it is important that we\ntalk about the power supply in general.\n\n31\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.200\nNow I wanna do a little bit of a recap\nfrom an earlier episode that we had,\n\n32\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.950\nright, we talked about form factor.\n\n33\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.133\nAnd one of the things that we've mentioned\nin a few different episode, right,\n\n34\n00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.201\nwe said three form factors have to match,\nright, three.\n\n35\n00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.350\nAll right, well what is that,\nwhat are those three?\n\n36\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.858\nWell one of them is gonna be your case,\nyour tower, right, chassis,\n\n37\n00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.685\nthree different terms meaning\nthe same thing, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:53.400\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It is the skin, if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.280\nthat holds all of the system\nunit components together.\n\n40\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.130\nThe next one is the motherboard,\nright, again kinda like\n\n41\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.135\nthe backbone to the entire system unit,\nright, ties everything together.\n\n42\n00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.990\nAnd last but not least what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode is the power\n\n43\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.860\nsupply unit, right, and that's important\nto understand that the power supply unit,\n\n44\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.060\nor PSU if you will,\nthat it also has a form factor.\n\n45\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.410\nIt's not just about the size and\nthe shape of the power supply,\n\n46\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.990\nthat certainly is a major consideration,\nright, but\n\n47\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.750\nit's also about things like the power\nconnections that you have available,\n\n48\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.960\nright, that's why it's also important.\n\n49\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.452\nIf we take a trip back in time and\nwe go back to the AT standard,\n\n50\n00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:37.415\nright, that was the predecessor\nto the ATX board.\n\n51\n00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:41.935\nNow the ATX form factor's been in place\nfor a long time, you guys as the taping of\n\n52\n00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:45.715\nthis you guys and gals out there probably\nrealize it's somewhere around 2017,\n\n53\n00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:49.355\nmaybe give or take a few months\ndepending on when you're watching this.\n\n54\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.439\nWell the ATX standard came out in 1995,\nso again we're talking before that,\n\n55\n00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.520\nright, they had the AT standard and here's\nwhere form factor also comes into play.\n\n56\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.080\nIn the AT days, right,\nthe AT motherboards,\n\n57\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.767\nthey had two main power\nconnectors on the motherboard.\n\n58\n00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:10.110\nThey had what was known as a P8 and\na P9 connector, right, and\n\n59\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.980\nthey were identical and the problem with\nthat is that they could be reversed.\n\n60\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.890\nAnd that's a really bad day at the office,\nright, when you power up a power supply\n\n61\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.180\nwhere the main power connectors have\nactually been flip-flopped, right, so\n\n62\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.290\nyou had to pay attention to\nthe coloring of the wires.\n\n63\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.475\nAnd we're gonna talk a little bit about\nsome of the different voltages that you\n\n64\n00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:30.040\ncan find and the colors,\nif you will, of some of these wires.\n\n65\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.430\nNow I want you to understand that's one of\nthe main reasons you have to understand\n\n66\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.850\nthe form factor, right, not only just the\nsize and the characteristics, if you will,\n\n67\n00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.840\nthe arrangement of the components\nwithin the system unit, but\n\n68\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.420\nalso because of the main power supply.\n\n69\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.054\nSee when the ATX standard first came\nout we had a 20 pin power connector,\n\n70\n00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:53.313\nright, we had a 20 pin power\nconnector that was a keyed or locked,\n\n71\n00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:58.140\nlocking connector, right, and I'll\nshow you what I mean here in a second.\n\n72\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.175\nBut it was different because they knew\nthe problems that the AT power supply had,\n\n73\n00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:05.210\nright, and\nreally when it comes down to it it's\n\n74\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.920\nmore the technicians than it\nis the actual hardware itself.\n\n75\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.230\nSo they said you know what,\nlet's make it a little bit easier so\n\n76\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.846\nyou know exactly how to insert this\nmain power connector on the motherboard.\n\n77\n00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:20.550\nSo they made it a notched connector,\nright, it has some shapes that it\n\n78\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.780\nfollows with the main power\nconnector on the motherboard and\n\n79\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.090\nhe main power plug itself that comes\noff the back of the power supply.\n\n80\n00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.700\nAll right, as time progressed we needed\na little bit more power on the CPU so they\n\n81\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.490\ncame out with what was known as the 20+4\npin connector, right, and that extra four\n\n82\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.920\npins, if you will, would power the Pentium\nprocessors that came out in the day.\n\n83\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.888\nBecause Pentium kind of shattered\neverything when it comes\n\n84\n00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:47.151\nto power requirements,\nthey're really power hungry, right,\n\n85\n00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:49.660\nreally powerful processors,\nso we needed more.\n\n86\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.237\nToday's standard follows what's known as,\nagain it's the ATX standard still but\n\n87\n00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:58.700\nit's kind of gone through some revisions\nand today is a solid 24 pin connector.\n\n88\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.210\nAll right, so understand that,\nso what is the power supply?\n\n89\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.360\nThat's a little bit about the form factor\nand we'll look at those connectors here\n\n90\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.350\nbecause we can actually\nkind of show you all three.\n\n91\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.410\nSome of the power supply companies today\nthey're just really smart about how they\n\n92\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.080\nput their power supplies together, and\nthey actually put some power supplies\n\n93\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.470\ntogether so that it didn't matter if\nyou had which of the three revisions\n\n94\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.710\nof ATX standard you had,\nyou'd get one power supply and\n\n95\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.810\nit would support all three so\nit's nice the way they put those together.\n\n96\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.580\nSo let's talk about some basics as well,\n\n97\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.310\nnot just form factor, remember form\nfactor's important, all right.\n\n98\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.240\nThe other thing that you have to keep in\nmind is what is the power supply doing?\n\n99\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.198\nWell you could say well, Wes,\nyou just told us, right, and\n\n100\n00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:42.006\nit'd be a very short episode, too.\n\n101\n00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:43.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It brings\n\n102\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.841\npower into our devices or our components\nwithin the system unit, it does, but\n\n103\n00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:52.622\nwhat it's doing is it's actually taking\nthe alternating current that's coming\n\n104\n00:05:52.622 --> 00:05:56.580\nfrom your AC outlet in the wall and\nit's converting it.\n\n105\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.750\nIt's converting it from alternating\ncurrent into the direct\n\n106\n00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.220\ncurrent that our components need\nto operate properly, right,\n\n107\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.800\nthey don't do well off\nof frequency variations.\n\n108\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.790\nSo alternating current isn't what\nyour computer circuitry runs off of,\n\n109\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.730\nit runs off a direct current, DC power,\nso it takes the AC power from the wall,\n\n110\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.370\nit converts it into DC, and\nthen it goes to power the devices.\n\n111\n00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.160\nBut it has to do something else, believe\nit or not it also does what's known as\n\n112\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.150\npower sequencing,\nit's a stepping down of the voltages.\n\n113\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.910\nCuz if you think about it, right, the\nvoltages that we have coming from the wall\n\n114\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.040\nhow many volts do we have,\nwe have roughly 110 volts.\n\n115\n00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.252\nSo 110 volts, what do we need for\nour computer circuitry, we need 12 volts,\n\n116\n00:06:37.252 --> 00:06:39.710\nwell that's a little bit of overkill,\nright?\n\n117\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.853\n[LAUGH] So-\n&gt;&gt; So stepping down is important.\n\n118\n00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:43.410\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's exactly it.\n\n119\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.400\nSo what we need is that current comes in,\nor I should say out,\n\n120\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.540\nof the AC outlet, right,\ngoes into the power supply,\n\n121\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.970\nthe power supply converts\nit to direct current.\n\n122\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.010\nBut then it goes through this process\nof stepping down the voltages\n\n123\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.620\nto the main three voltages that we\nsee inside of our computers, right,\n\n124\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.855\nthat's gonna be 12 volts, that's gonna be\n5 volts, and it's going to be 3.3 volts.\n\n125\n00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:09.945\nNow understand that your RAM, there's\nalso some other voltage regulation that\n\n126\n00:07:09.945 --> 00:07:13.545\ngoes on inside of the motherboard\nbecause certain things like DDR3\n\n127\n00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:18.133\ntoday are RAM that we talk about in\nother episodes, is even lower than that.\n\n128\n00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:22.665\nSo there's more voltage regulation\nthat goes onto that, but before\n\n129\n00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:27.188\nthat happens those are the main three\nvoltages that we need to be aware of.\n\n130\n00:07:27.188 --> 00:07:29.870\nNow I wanna talk a little bit about\n\n131\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.030\nsome of the two different types\nof voltages you could see.\n\n132\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.792\nYou could see 110, I've talked about,\nand that's common here in the States.\n\n133\n00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:41.295\nHowever if you're in other nations,\nthings like Europe over there,\n\n134\n00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:43.813\nyou might have 220, all right, and\n\n135\n00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:48.466\nthe power supplies need to be set to\nthe right setting in order to, well,\n\n136\n00:07:48.466 --> 00:07:52.465\nmake sure that you don't underpower or\noverpower a machine.\n\n137\n00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:55.494\nRight, if you underpower it then\nyou just cause all kinds of havoc,\n\n138\n00:07:55.494 --> 00:07:58.114\nyou overpower it you can ruin\nelectrical damage, right?\n\n139\n00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:01.121\nYou could fry things in the mother\nboard quite literary, right?\n\n140\n00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.140\nYou never wanna smell a burning smell or\nsmoke, right?\n\n141\n00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.170\nYou definitely done some damage here.\n\n142\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.500\nIf we could take a look at the power\nserver, so we've got one here, right?\n\n143\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.340\nAnd this power supply believe it or\n\n144\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.190\nnot is what is known as an auto\nswitching power supply, right?\n\n145\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.690\nBecause one of the things that I see here,\nright, we have our 12 volt, right,\n\n146\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.530\nAC adapter that goes into\nthe back of the power supply.\n\n147\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.600\nWe have an on off switch right?\n\n148\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.940\nNot everyone of the power supplies is even\ngonna have a manual on off switch right?\n\n149\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.514\nBut there's another switch that's\nmissing out here right, and\n\n150\n00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.979\nthat is the little selector switch.\n\n151\n00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:40.109\nSometimes on the back of the power\nsupply what you're gonna see is that\n\n152\n00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:44.519\nthere's this little red switch and\nif you fix it to one side it says 110 or\n\n153\n00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:49.997\n115 I think it says and then you fix it to\nthe other side, it says 220 or 225, right?\n\n154\n00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:55.121\nThat's letting you know that you're\neither running if you're here this stage,\n\n155\n00:08:55.121 --> 00:08:59.350\nyou run 110 or\n115 as it might say on the power supply.\n\n156\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.940\nIf you're over in the other like European\nnations and stuff, you would fix it and\n\n157\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.330\nswitch it manually to the 225, that's\nwhat not as a fixed input power supply.\n\n158\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.090\nHowever, a lot of them today Zach are just\nlike we see here, I don't have anything\n\n159\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.260\nother than the on off switch,\nI don't have any manual switch here.\n\n160\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.390\nAnd even if I turn this to the other side,\nyou'll see, well, it's pretty much blank,\n\n161\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.610\nthere's nothing there.\n\n162\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.630\nAnd what that means is\nthis is auto switching.\n\n163\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:32.025\nIt means, the power supply can detect\nwhat voltage you're suppose to be on,\n\n164\n00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:34.266\n[CROSSTALK] That's exactly it,\n\n165\n00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:39.417\nit automatically adjust to the proper\nvoltage coming from the AC outlet.\n\n166\n00:09:39.417 --> 00:09:43.417\nNow, if you ever need to know a little\nbit more about the voltages that you\n\n167\n00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:44.490\nmight see.\n\n168\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.740\nYou can actually and if we could zoom in\njust a little bit here, you could see that\n\n169\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.530\nthere's a panel right here that kind\nof tells us some information right?\n\n170\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:57.300\nIt says DC output, and I can see that\nthere's 3.3 volts, I can see 5 volts and\n\n171\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.850\nI can see 12 volts, right, so\nI know what I'm supposed to expect.\n\n172\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.310\nI can also see the wattage here too and\nthis is a pretty beefy power supply,\n\n173\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.230\nthis is a kilowatt power supply,\nit's 1000 watts, 1050 watts and\n\n174\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.260\nI believe that's Might be match load,\nyeah, match load here.\n\n175\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.950\nSo this is a pretty strong power supply,\n\n176\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.990\nit's got a lot of get up and\ngo here, all right?\n\n177\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.690\nSo, that's some of the basics about your\npower supplies that we want you to know.\n\n178\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.780\nI want you to keep in mind\nthat when it comes down to it,\n\n179\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.450\nif you don't see the selector switch\non the outside of the power supply, and\n\n180\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.770\nI'm not talking about the on-off switch\ncuz you can have a manual on-off switch.\n\n181\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.130\nIf you notice that some of them don't\nhave an on-off switch, what's that about?\n\n182\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.980\nWell that means that because of\nthe advanced configuration power interface\n\n183\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.000\nACPI, believe Intel started it.\n\n184\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.660\nThere used to be a day, and\nZack maybe you remember this,\n\n185\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.550\nback in the days of like Windows 95 and\n98.\n\n186\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.970\nDo you ever remember shutting your\ncomputer off and then in the middle of\n\n187\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.920\nthe screen it would say,\nit's now safe to shut down your computer.\n\n188\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember that?\n\n189\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.660\n&gt;&gt; I still do.\n\n190\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Now what was happening there was, that\nwas before the days when software could\n\n191\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:09.910\ncontrol the power right, to your hardware,\nand so it's been a while, right?\n\n192\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.640\nToday we have the advance\nconfiguration power interface, ACPI,\n\n193\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.060\nintel invented invented it.\n\n194\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.930\nThat means the software could send\na shutdown signal to the power supply, and\n\n195\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.810\nthat's why today, when you shut off your\noperating systems everything shuts off,\n\n196\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.750\npower supply turns off and\neverything, right?\n\n197\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.520\nSo, understand that,\n\n198\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.660\nthat's why some of the power supplies\nmight not have an on/off switch.\n\n199\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.070\nSome of them do so you can manually\nturn it off after the fact.\n\n200\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.460\nI wouldn't recommend ever\nJust reaching over and\n\n201\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.140\ndoing a hard shutdown, right,\ndo a graceful shutdown, right?\n\n202\n00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.370\nAnd that means the operating system\nshuts itself down through that advanced\n\n203\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.680\nconfiguration power interface.\n\n204\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.080\nBecause if you reach over and\nyou do a hard shutdown,\n\n205\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.770\nyou do run the risk of what's known as\na critical kernel power failure, and\n\n206\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.570\nyou could lose some of your data, right?\n\n207\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.740\nYour computer could be right in the middle\nof a write the read processes aren't so\n\n208\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.010\nbad on the hard drive, but it could be\nright in the middle of a write process.\n\n209\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.600\nAnd you've gotta remember, too,\nthat you always have the paging file.\n\n210\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.020\nThat little portion of the hard\ndrive that's used as memory,\n\n211\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.620\noperating system is constantly\nwriting to the paging file.\n\n212\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.500\nSo if you reach over and you turn\nthat power off and doing a cold shut\n\n213\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.140\ndown like that or a hard shut down like\nthat, you could corrupt your information.\n\n214\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.560\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\nI'll tell you what,\n\n215\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.190\nlet's take a look at\nsome of the connectors,\n\n216\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.490\nthe various connectors on our power\nsupply and, man, we have a bunch.\n\n217\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.852\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask you,\nwhat is all that spaghetti there?\n\n218\n00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:35.696\n&gt;&gt; We got a lot of spaghetti here but\nwe got a lot of different types of\n\n219\n00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:39.018\nconnections and that's one of the\nimportant things about choosing a power\n\n220\n00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:42.467\nsupply, making sure that you have\nadequate amount of connections, right?\n\n221\n00:12:42.467 --> 00:12:46.842\nOne of the first ones that we have here\nthat we've talked about in other episodes\n\n222\n00:12:46.842 --> 00:12:47.898\nis the serial ATA.\n\n223\n00:12:47.898 --> 00:12:51.721\nNow I do want you guys and\ngirls out there,\n\n224\n00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:57.082\nwe've shown you these connectors\nup close and personal.\n\n225\n00:12:57.082 --> 00:13:00.534\nI do not want you to think that on\nthe exam If they ask you what this\n\n226\n00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:04.730\nconnector is, that they're just gonna\nhave a labeled setter, all right?\n\n227\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.970\nRemember that a serial ATA connector,\nright, it goes for\n\n228\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.250\nour serial ATA drives, our SATA drives\nif you will or hard drives right?\n\n229\n00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.140\nIt's 15 pin blade type connector and\nyou can almost see it right there,\n\n230\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.290\nyou can see some of those pins\nup here as they kinda glisten.\n\n231\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.950\nNow, trust me, when I tell you it's 15\npins, you could always find the pictures\n\n232\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.470\nthat we've shown you and you can pull\nthem up and you can count the pins.\n\n233\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.180\nBut right, this is a blade with an L type\nconnector and it's another one of those\n\n234\n00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.680\nones that wouldn't allow you to reverse\nit, right, and that's a good thing, right?\n\n235\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.100\nSo if we talk about the pin outage here,\nright?\n\n236\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.179\nYou'll see that there are a series\nof colored wires, right?\n\n237\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.540\nIf we look at, for instance,\nthe yellow wire on this one,\n\n238\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.120\nthat's actually a 12 volt power\nconnector that we talked about.\n\n239\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.100\nThen you'll see some black wires here,\nright?\n\n240\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.280\nThe black wires are the ground wires,\nand we also see red and orange.\n\n241\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.990\nWhen we look at orange, I'll tell you\nwhat, we'll just go in order here,\n\n242\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.260\nwe'll talk about the red one\nhere in the middle, right?\n\n243\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.534\nThat red one in the middle is\nactually the five volt connector, and\n\n244\n00:14:08.534 --> 00:14:11.233\nthen the orange is the 3.3 volt connector,\nright?\n\n245\n00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:17.287\nSo you can see all the major voltages that\nwe were talking about when it steps down,\n\n246\n00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:22.672\nthe power supply steps it down from\nthe 110 coming from the AC outlet.\n\n247\n00:14:22.672 --> 00:14:26.346\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nkinda skip outta order here Zach and\n\n248\n00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:29.478\nI'm gonna do that for\na reason because I wanted to talk about,\n\n249\n00:14:29.478 --> 00:14:33.220\nthis connector here,\nthis is very very important, right?\n\n250\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.110\nRemember we said form factor.\n\n251\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n252\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.370\nWhen talked about form factor,\nit is important to remember that\n\n253\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.110\npart of the form factor is this\nmain power connector, right?\n\n254\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.130\nAnd this main power connector,\n\n255\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.110\nwe could see its kinda got some\ndifferent shapes along the pins, right?\n\n256\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.010\nThat's what they mean when\nthey say they're keyed, right?\n\n257\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.510\nThey're keyed in a way so\n\n258\n00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.480\nthat if you plug them into the mother\nboard it's very hard to reverse them.\n\n259\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.720\nAnd I'm not saying, I'd sort of having\na hammer, that you couldn't reverse them,\n\n260\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.090\nbut you certainly shouldn't be doing this.\n\n261\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.760\nIf you're gonna reverse this plug, chances\nare this might not be the industry for\n\n262\n00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.990\nyou, because it's very,\nIt's very intuitive on how it goes in.\n\n263\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.900\nNow, notice that one piece of\nthis is kind of separated, right?\n\n264\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is a good\n\n265\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.670\nthing that I was telling you about\nthe power supply manufacturers, right?\n\n266\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.790\nThis is the original,\n20 pin connector here, right?\n\n267\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.153\nThis was the original AT standard,\nand notice that lock right there,\n\n268\n00:15:28.153 --> 00:15:29.340\nthat little button\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n269\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.380\n&gt;&gt; That actually locks it in place and it\nmakes it so it won't, through vibration,\n\n270\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.890\ncome out of the power connector\nin here and that's important.\n\n271\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.520\nThe other thing, too,\n\n272\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.700\nis you can tell plainly when this\nthing is seeded properly, right?\n\n273\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.284\nIf that clip doesn't lock,\nthen you haven't seeded that power,\n\n274\n00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:51.708\nthat main motherboard power supply, or\nexcuse me, power connector correctly.\n\n275\n00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:55.645\nNow, when the ATX standard was revised,\nthey said hey,\n\n276\n00:15:55.645 --> 00:16:00.161\nwe need another four pins,\nTo power the Pentium 4 processor.\n\n277\n00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:00.721\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n278\n00:16:00.721 --> 00:16:05.206\n&gt;&gt; So for those motherboards, what you\nwould do, is you would plug the 20 pin\n\n279\n00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:09.288\nconnector here, into the main power\nconnector on the motherboard.\n\n280\n00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:12.230\nAnd then this one would usually opt to,\nand\n\n281\n00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.760\nagain not exactly sure\nthat directive placement.\n\n282\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.899\nBut if I'm thinking about\nlooking at the motherboard,\n\n283\n00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.983\nit would be on the left or\nthe right hand side of the CPU.\n\n284\n00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:25.118\nYou would have this little\nfour pin connector, right?\n\n285\n00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:27.704\nAnd they call it a four P connector.\n\n286\n00:16:27.704 --> 00:16:29.371\nAgain four pin, right?\n\n287\n00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:29.914\n&gt;&gt; Yep\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n288\n00:16:29.914 --> 00:16:35.660\nyou might even see that it might have been\ncalled the Pentium Connector as well.\n\n289\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.332\nSome people say P4, for Pentium 4\nprocessor but it's actually four pin,\n\n290\n00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:45.615\nagain, just remember that's when Pentium\ncame out, Pentium processors came out.\n\n291\n00:16:45.615 --> 00:16:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right now, as time progressed,\n\n292\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.110\nwe got PCIE, the bus interface that was\nintroduced into the motherboards and\n\n293\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.690\nthat required an additional set of power,\nall right?\n\n294\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.640\nAnd here's the thing,\n\n295\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.190\nthe 20-pin connector would no longer\ngive us the amount of power we needed.\n\n296\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:12.570\nSo today's standard is actually\na solid 24-pin connector and\n\n297\n00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.200\nI can't put this together, so\nyou could see them there, there we go.\n\n298\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.460\nBut it's a solid 24-pin connector.\n\n299\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.086\nSo Zach, what we've got going on here\nis from the manufacturer, they said,\n\n300\n00:17:23.086 --> 00:17:27.426\nyou know what, we're gonna let you\nsupport every single motherboard,\n\n301\n00:17:27.426 --> 00:17:30.647\nATX standard,\nyou have in one power supply, right.\n\n302\n00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:37.235\nWe're gonna give you the 20-pin, we'll\ngive you the 20 plus 4-pin connector.\n\n303\n00:17:37.235 --> 00:17:40.751\nAnd then if you need, go ahead and\nput them together and\n\n304\n00:17:40.751 --> 00:17:44.689\nyou can use them like this as\na 24-pin connector, right.\n\n305\n00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:49.385\nSo that's very, very important and it's\nimportant to understand that right for\n\n306\n00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:50.073\nyour exam.\n\n307\n00:17:50.073 --> 00:17:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n308\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, there are other\nconnectors that we have here too.\n\n309\n00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.780\nLet me see if I can reach out and\ngrab one of these Molex connectors, right?\n\n310\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.040\nNow, these Molex connectors are becoming,\nagain,\n\n311\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.090\nwe're starting to see\nan abundance of them, right?\n\n312\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.377\nThis is the 4-pin connector here and\nthe Molex connector is typically, well,\n\n313\n00:18:09.377 --> 00:18:11.844\nit used to be for\na couple of different things.\n\n314\n00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:16.800\nIt would be for the old parallel\nATA drives, the PATA drives.\n\n315\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.280\nHowever, we were not really\nusing parallel ATA anymore.\n\n316\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.050\nWhat we're using pretty\nmuch is serial ATA, so\n\n317\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.210\nwe've got a bunch of the serial\nATA connectors, right?.\n\n318\n00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.059\nSo if you wanna aggregate multiple drives,\n\n319\n00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:34.221\nyou wanna do a RAID configuration,\nyou wanna add more storage.\n\n320\n00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:38.492\nProvided that the mother board\nhas the data ports on them,\n\n321\n00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.120\nyour power supply will support it.\n\n322\n00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.525\nThe Molex connectors were for\nthe earlier parallel ATA power supplies.\n\n323\n00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:47.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n324\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.030\nThey would power those hard drives.\n\n325\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.340\nNow, and the SCSI drives for\nthat matter too.\n\n326\n00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.870\nNow, today what we can also use these for\nour system fans, right?\n\n327\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:00.630\nThe system fans allow you, they'll have\na 4-pin Molex connector there too and\n\n328\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.961\nthat's kind of cool.\n\n329\n00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:06.283\nAnd the reason I like that is because\nyou can take just one of these power\n\n330\n00:19:06.283 --> 00:19:09.581\nconnectors and\nI'll have male-female adapters and\n\n331\n00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:13.829\nyou can literally hook up every one\nof your case bands to a single power\n\n332\n00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:17.380\nadapter and\ndaisy chain one after the other.\n\n333\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.070\nNow, I will tell you,\nyou got to understand that you do\n\n334\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:25.340\nlose something if you\nuse the Molex connector.\n\n335\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:30.279\nTypically, what you do is you lose\nthe ability for the motherboard or\n\n336\n00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:32.590\nthe BIOS to monitor fan speeds.\n\n337\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:39.090\nAnd if it's a multi or variable\nspeed fan with the Molex connectors.\n\n338\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:44.506\nTypically, the BIOS can't increase\nthe voltage to basically increase the RPM,\n\n339\n00:19:44.506 --> 00:19:50.180\nso that is something that you do lose when\nyou use one of the 4-pin Molex Connectors.\n\n340\n00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.600\nAnd this has the same thing,\nas you can see that the other ones had,\n\n341\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.080\nwe got 12 volt connections and\nwe got two 12 volt connections here.\n\n342\n00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.618\nBecause as you can see,\nit's going off to another Molex Connector,\n\n343\n00:20:00.618 --> 00:20:03.796\nand that certainly isn't\nsomething that's uncommon here.\n\n344\n00:20:03.796 --> 00:20:07.202\nBut we've got the 12 volt connector,\ntwo grounds and\n\n345\n00:20:07.202 --> 00:20:10.916\nwe got a red here,\nin this case is another 5 volt connector.\n\n346\n00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:13.940\nAnd this one here,\nthis one's kinda hard to see.\n\n347\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.350\nThis one here, if we could zoom in maybe\njust a little bit more on that, you'll see\n\n348\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.110\nthat this one right there, thank you very\nmuch, this is called a bird connector.\n\n349\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.940\nThis is the old 4-pin\nbird connector that would\n\n350\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.010\nactually go to the back\nof the floppy drives.\n\n351\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n352\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.541\nwe don't really use them\ntoo much anymore if it all.\n\n353\n00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:35.322\nSo, it's not really called out, I think\nit might be called out on the exam,\n\n354\n00:20:35.322 --> 00:20:36.980\nbut I'm not really sure.\n\n355\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.930\nI don't think that one's\ngonna be called out anymore,\n\n356\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.350\nbut that is some of the main\nconnectors you have.\n\n357\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.540\nNow, there are other connectors\nthat we have to worry about too.\n\n358\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:51.657\nAs the motherboards and more importantly,\nthe CPUs required more power,\n\n359\n00:20:51.657 --> 00:20:58.740\neven a 24 -pin connector wouldn't be\nenough to power multi core processors.\n\n360\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.928\nSo what they did is they\nrevised the standard yet\n\n361\n00:21:03.928 --> 00:21:10.163\nagain, and they come out with\nan ATX 12 VDC connector.\n\n362\n00:21:10.163 --> 00:21:13.583\nAnd this is actually\nan 8-pin connector and\n\n363\n00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:17.274\nit looks just like the 4-P connector,\nright?\n\n364\n00:21:17.274 --> 00:21:19.022\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; And you'll see the 4-P connector.\n\n365\n00:21:19.022 --> 00:21:24.150\nNow the 4-pin connector,\nthat was in the ATX standard, all right.\n\n366\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:28.340\nFor a long time, servers have required\nextra power for their CPU, so\n\n367\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.380\nthere's something known as\nan EPS standard, right?\n\n368\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.060\nIt means Entry Level Power Supply and\nthat is an 8-pin connector\n\n369\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.110\nthat actually powers\nthe multi-core processors today.\n\n370\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.020\nSo that,\nsometimes you can find in it solid.\n\n371\n00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.839\nThis is again, a very cool power\nsupply and the fact that they,\n\n372\n00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:52.580\nthey let you power just a single\n4-pin power connector if you need or\n\n373\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.880\nin this case it's also follows\nthe 8-pin EPS standard as well.\n\n374\n00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.743\nSo, that's a CPU connector and\nwe have to be very careful with that.\n\n375\n00:22:00.743 --> 00:22:04.686\nAnd the reason I say is\nbecause side by side with it,\n\n376\n00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:08.357\nwe have a completely\nseparate type of 8-pin,\n\n377\n00:22:08.357 --> 00:22:13.986\npotentially 8-pin connector, and\nthat is our PCI standard, right.\n\n378\n00:22:13.986 --> 00:22:16.680\nAnd there we go, let me see if I can\nget the marking in here for you, right.\n\n379\n00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.520\nWe have a PCI express and\nthere's two different types, right.\n\n380\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.130\nThere's what is known as a 6-pin,\nwhich is this one right here.\n\n381\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:29.140\nAnd there is also what's known\nas an 8-pin PCIE, I said PCI,\n\n382\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.810\nlet me be careful with that,\nPCIE connector, right.\n\n383\n00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.350\nAnd this again, the power supply\nallows you the ability, right,\n\n384\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:43.200\nto use the 6-pin if needed or\n\n385\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.780\nto use the 8-pin if needed, right?\n\n386\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.960\nAnd again, you can see black here\nis gonna be the or not black,\n\n387\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.220\nblack's gonna be ground and\nyellow is gonna be the 12 volt connector.\n\n388\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.570\nDo not confuse these ladies and gentleman.\n\n389\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.943\nThese are not the same connectors, these\nare not the droids you're looking for.\n\n390\n00:23:00.943 --> 00:23:03.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is 8-pins, but\n\n391\n00:23:03.898 --> 00:23:07.140\nit goes to the PCIE interface.\n\n392\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.830\nThis is a 8-pins, but\nit's an EPS standard that goes to the CPU.\n\n393\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:17.892\nYou had to be very, very careful with that\nwhen you are connecting these connectors,\n\n394\n00:23:17.892 --> 00:23:22.740\nmake sure that you are putting\nthem in the right spot.\n\n395\n00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.350\nNow, the other thing that you could have\ntoo is you can have what's known as a duo\n\n396\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.090\nrail power supply.\n\n397\n00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.420\nThe duo rail power supply, notice that\nwe've got all the spaghetti here and\n\n398\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.330\nyou can't really tell, right, I'd have to\nlook on the side where we talked about\n\n399\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.030\nknowing what the wattage was,\nthe specification, right?\n\n400\n00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:43.927\nDou rail typically, mean you have single\nrail and duo rail, it just means that,\n\n401\n00:23:43.927 --> 00:23:47.830\nand I don't, when I'm gonna say this,\ndon't do this, okay.\n\n402\n00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.799\nI mean theoretically, if we we're to crack\nthis open what we would see, is that\n\n403\n00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:57.247\nsome of these wires go to a certain\namount of electrical traces on a PCB,\n\n404\n00:23:57.247 --> 00:24:00.010\na circuit board inside\nof the power supply.\n\n405\n00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:05.439\nAnd another set of this mess of spaghetti\nconnects directly to another portion\n\n406\n00:24:05.439 --> 00:24:10.560\nof a PCB right, and it kind of spreads\nout things like amperage and stuff.\n\n407\n00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.750\nI don't know which one is better honestly.\n\n408\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.390\nI've seen people debate, and\n\n409\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:20.240\nif you guys are electric engineers out\nthere you could probably let me know.\n\n410\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.140\nBut that's just what it means, it means\nportions of the wires here, if you will,\n\n411\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:32.720\nwill go to their two separate PCBs\ninside of the power supply unit itself.\n\n412\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.280\nAll right, so\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n413\n00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.790\nNow you can actually test these and\nsee the voltages.\n\n414\n00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:44.680\nAnd in fact, we've got what's known\nas an ATX power supply tester here.\n\n415\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.180\nAnd this is one in which all\nyou have to do is you just,\n\n416\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.680\nyou'll see that its got various plugs,\nright?\n\n417\n00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.179\nFor our different types of plugs that we\ncould see on this motherboard, right?\n\n418\n00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:58.832\nAnd what I would do is I just come in\nhere and I would plug in first of all.\n\n419\n00:24:58.832 --> 00:25:02.908\nAnd you can kinda see it light up there,\nbut I don't have the 4 pin standard so\n\n420\n00:25:02.908 --> 00:25:07.070\nit's gonna, it might bark at me a little\nbit there until I get this one in here.\n\n421\n00:25:08.085 --> 00:25:08.645\nSee there.\n\n422\n00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:13.145\nThere's the 24 pen and it recognizes\nit and sure enough it comes on.\n\n423\n00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:15.465\nNow what it's doing,\nis it's actually testing.\n\n424\n00:25:15.465 --> 00:25:17.875\nLet me make sure I get\nthat in there correctly.\n\n425\n00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:20.985\nIt's actually testing the main\npower connector, right?\n\n426\n00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:25.490\nAnd it's letting me know that hey, and\nlet me turn that back on, it's got an auto\n\n427\n00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.590\noff there, it's letting me know the 5\nvolt, the 12 volt and the 3 volt, right?\n\n428\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.840\nSo I can see that, and you might say well\nwait a second Wes you told us 5 volts,\n\n429\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.937\nI see 5.1 And\nyou told us 12 volts, I see 12.1.\n\n430\n00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:43.480\nYou said 3.3 which is, thank you 3.3,\nyou actually didn't make a liar out of me.\n\n431\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And it just\n\n432\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.010\nmeans that you'll see that there's\njust general tolerance ranges, right?\n\n433\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you're just a little bit over,\n\n434\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.510\nthe components can only draw the power\nfrom the power supply that they need.\n\n435\n00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.220\nWe don't have to worry about that.\n\n436\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:26:00.520\nYou'll see that I can also take, and\nI could hook up the molex connector.\n\n437\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.060\nAnd if we wanted to test the molex\nconnector we could, all right.\n\n438\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.650\nSo let me go ahead and turn this back on.\n\n439\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.190\nAnd it tells me MOX.\n\n440\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.030\nI don't know if you can see,\nyeah there you go, very good.\n\n441\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.400\nYou could see it says MOX right, that's\nthe abbreviation for the molex connector.\n\n442\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.110\n&gt;&gt; Molex, Yeah.\n\n443\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.010\n&gt;&gt; So I could sit here and\ndo another click and I could see that yes,\n\n444\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.940\nthe, red wires and the yellow wires.\n\n445\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.740\n5 volts and 12 volts, and\nI can see right here that\n\n446\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.950\nthat power supply is putting that\nmolex connector within its ranges.\n\n447\n00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:30.713\nSo very, very good.\n\n448\n00:26:30.713 --> 00:26:35.470\nLet me go ahead and actually, if we could\njust leave that in there and I can grab,\n\n449\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.111\nlet's see here what else?\n\n450\n00:26:37.111 --> 00:26:42.660\nOkay, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll do the PCI-E version as well.\n\n451\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.700\nI can also put the PCI-E version in there\nif I could find one that I can actually\n\n452\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.220\nuse.\n\n453\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.750\nAnd we can do the same thing,\nwe can plug this one in.\n\n454\n00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.790\nAnd again it's another one of those,\nlet me make sure I get that right there,\n\n455\n00:26:54.790 --> 00:27:00.120\none of those locking connector, so\nshouldn't be too bad to get in here.\n\n456\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.750\nThere we go and we'll plug that in.\n\n457\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.440\nAnd we'll plug this one in.\n\n458\n00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.700\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nwhile we're at it we'll go ahead and\n\n459\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.420\nwe'll go a little bit farther here.\n\n460\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.950\nRight, you guys can see me struggle\nwith all these wires here on camera.\n\n461\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.210\nWe'll go ahead, and what we'll do is\nwe'll put in the CPU connector too.\n\n462\n00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.760\nAnd again I really like this for\nthe ATX standard, cuz it lets you\n\n463\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.010\nbasically test just about all, actually\nall of the connectors that are on here.\n\n464\n00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.220\nAnd we'll go ahead, if you can see\nthat there, and we'll go ahead and\n\n465\n00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.040\nwe'll put the serial ATA one on there too.\n\n466\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.904\nSo now we have all the connectors Zack.\n\n467\n00:27:34.904 --> 00:27:36.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did it, right?\n\n468\n00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.720\n&gt;&gt; What do we have for them Johnny?\n\n469\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.420\n&gt;&gt; It looks like an abstract statue.\n\n470\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.030\n&gt;&gt; We have, [LAUGH] that's right.\n\n471\n00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:42.910\nWhat do we have for '?\n\n472\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.770\nNot an electrocution hopefully.\n\n473\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.280\nAnd I can see that all\nthe individual ones are lit up.\n\n474\n00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.870\n24 pin, we've got PCI-E.\n\n475\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:55.640\nWe've got the CPU MOX and\nserial ATA or SATA, right?\n\n476\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.860\nAnd then what I can do is I can test the\nmain voltages off the main power supply,\n\n477\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.070\nwe click that and which one is that?\n\n478\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.070\nThat's a PCI-E, well it doesn't say PCI-E,\nbut it is PCI, it's the only PCI.\n\n479\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:11.120\nWell it better be PCI-E or\nit's lying to me.\n\n480\n00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.040\nAnd that's 12 volts which is what I want.\n\n481\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.810\nI can see the CPU is 12 volts.\n\n482\n00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.490\nSo notice that the CPU and\n\n483\n00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.760\nthe PCI-E are the same voltages,\nthey are not the same connector.\n\n484\n00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.710\nI just want you guys to keep that in mind.\n\n485\n00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.260\nMake sure that you're paying attention,\nright?\n\n486\n00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.060\nAnd then we've got again the one\nthat we've already seen, right?\n\n487\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.100\nWe've got our molex connector,\nMOX if you will.\n\n488\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:36.220\nAnd then last, but not least certainly\nwe have, there it is, the SATA.\n\n489\n00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.834\nNow again, remember the serial ATA\ntold you there's a red, yellow, and\n\n490\n00:28:39.834 --> 00:28:40.599\norange right?\n\n491\n00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:44.793\nRed is the five in this case it's within\nthe tolerances, just a little bit over.\n\n492\n00:28:44.793 --> 00:28:51.050\nWe got 12.2 for the yellow wire,\nand the orange wire there was 3.3.\n\n493\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.600\nSo those are our voltages, and\nthat's a quick way that you can just\n\n494\n00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.300\nkinda see if those are in\nthe range that you want.\n\n495\n00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.450\nIt's great to have one of those\nATX standard testers on you.\n\n496\n00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.770\nWhen we talk about some of\nthe troubleshooting things,\n\n497\n00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.600\nwe'll look a little bit more or\n\n498\n00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.080\njust kinda recap some of the things that\nyou can see on the power supply testers.\n\n499\n00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.220\nWe'll also take out things\nlike multimeters but,\n\n500\n00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.980\nthose are the things that you need to\nknow when it comes to power supply.\n\n501\n00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.460\nRecognize your form factors.\n\n502\n00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.180\nRecognize your standards.\n\n503\n00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:24.170\nAnd potentially know one of the three\nmajor voltages that you have\n\n504\n00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.430\ninside of your system.\n\n505\n00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.060\n&gt;&gt; Wes, once again, wonderful job.\n\n506\n00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.030\nVery thorough, power supplies.\n\n507\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.650\nInstead of CompTIA A+ and make sure you\nwatch every single episode of CompTIA A+.\n\n508\n00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.330\nAnd go to our course

00:00:12.226\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITpro.tv\n\n4\n00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:13.682\n&gt;&gt; Alright, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.648\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITprotv.\n\n6\n00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:20.372\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n7\n00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:23.570\n220901 series for the A+, that's right.\n\n8\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.370\nJoining us back in the studio again to\nlend his expertise on that very topic,\n\n9\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.210\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.210\nWes, glad to have you again man,\nhow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.553\n&gt;&gt; I think it's going all right,\nwe're gonna find out that's for sure.\n\n12\n00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:34.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's great to be here guys.\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.960\nGreat to see all of you out there\nin electrical limbo, thanks for\n\n14\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.650\njoining us today.\n\n15\n00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.070\nThat's right, we're going to be looking at\nsome of the concepts behind custom PCs.\n\n16\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.150\nNow when we talk about customizing a PC,\nwhat do we really mean by that?\n\n17\n00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.810\nWell, when you build a computer, one\nof the things to keep in mind is, well,\n\n18\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.140\nwhat is the purpose of the computer, what\nare you going to use the computer for?\n\n19\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a philosophy of use.\n\n20\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.864\n&gt;&gt; It really is because if you're\ngoing to spend money on it,\n\n21\n00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.636\nare you spending enough money?\n\n22\n00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:03.790\nAre you spending too much money, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.549\nAnd really the functionality behind it\nis one of the things that has to always\n\n24\n00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:08.379\nbe considered.\n\n25\n00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:12.053\nSo for instance,\nif I need to make a media server, well,\n\n26\n00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:16.112\na media server is gonna have\nmaybe some different components,\n\n27\n00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:19.960\nall the same components that\nare in just basic system unit.\n\n28\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.020\nBut there might be some specialized\ncomponents that are in that device\n\n29\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.470\nthat allow us to do things like\nmore efficiently stream media.\n\n30\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.490\nVersus something where maybe we're\ndoing virtualization, right?\n\n31\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.910\nWe talked about in an earlier episode\nabout CPUs supporting virtualization,\n\n32\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.600\na way to run multiple operating\nsystems simultaneously on a single\n\n33\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.710\nphysical computer.\n\n34\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.420\nAlright, well if we are going\nto build a computer like that\n\n35\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.492\nwe have to have resources available for\nall of those individual operating systems.\n\n36\n00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:47.750\nSo that's what we\nare going to look at today.\n\n37\n00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.220\nThey do call out on\nthe objective they call out\n\n38\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.870\nquite a few different types\nof customized builds and\n\n39\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.660\nyou are going to have to be able\nto identify them on the exam.\n\n40\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.970\nYou might get questions where they\nsay you have to build XYZ machine.\n\n41\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.750\nYou have components xyz and we need to\nknow what we need to do with them, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.020\nAgain, it is going to be\nimportant to keep these in mind.\n\n43\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.255\nNow, what we are going to do is,\nDan doesn't realize, but\n\n44\n00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:14.592\nI actually did a pickpocket right before\nthe show and we've got his credit card.\n\n45\n00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:15.142\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n46\n00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:15.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:17.913\n&gt;&gt; We are going to go shopping here and\n\n48\n00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:20.600\nhe has only yet\nto learn about it just now, so.\n\n49\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.679\n&gt;&gt; I'm not worried about it\nbecause it will just say declined.\n\n50\n00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.492\n&gt;&gt; That's right they\nchecked my credit one time\n\n51\n00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:25.154\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:27.520\n&gt;&gt; And it said, yeah right.\n\n53\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.060\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n54\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.160\nLet's dive in, right?.\n\n55\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.034\nSo some of the machines that we're gonna\nlook at are gonna require things like\n\n56\n00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:35.624\nmulti-processor, well,\nmulticore processors.\n\n57\n00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:39.603\nAnd it's kinda hard today to find quad\nprocessor that doesn't have multicore that\n\n58\n00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:43.680\nisn't in a museum and that's just\nbecause it's been, it's very prevalent.\n\n59\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.250\nIt's been prevalent now\nsince the mid 2000s\n\n60\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.551\nwhen you really started seeing dual core.\n\n61\n00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:54.257\nAnd then heck I was gonna say I've even\nseen, we were actually talking about this,\n\n62\n00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.964\nsome of the computer CPUs if you will that\nare coming out today that have 16 cores up\n\n63\n00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:01.947\nto 32 threads are just\nabsolutely mind boggling.\n\n64\n00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:06.645\nIt is insane the level of power that you\ncan get by these, but not every machine is\n\n65\n00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:11.230\ngoing to require that level of power and\nthat's what we want to address here.\n\n66\n00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.235\n&gt;&gt; I can't imagine what\nmachine that would be, Wes.\n\n67\n00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:14.632\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably mine at home.\n\n68\n00:03:14.632 --> 00:03:16.362\n&gt;&gt; A word processing machine.\n\n69\n00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.519\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nif I need to send fast email, right?\n\n70\n00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:23.285\n&gt;&gt; Fast emails, they get there fast.\n\n72\n00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:25.875\nLet's go ahead and let's dive in\nto the very first type of machine.\n\n73\n00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.935\nAnd we're really just going\nto use any old computer or\n\n74\n00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:30.535\ncomputer supply company out there.\n\n75\n00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:33.715\nWe're actually using a very good\none out there that I like, Newegg.\n\n76\n00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:36.359\nGuys, we're not getting any royalties or\nanything out of this or\n\n77\n00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.403\nanything like that, it's just they've\nbeen a really good go-to place.\n\n78\n00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:41.810\nBut there's other places out there too,\nlike Tiger Direct.\n\n79\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.460\nYou could see things like Best Buy has\ncomponents that you can acquire there too.\n\n80\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.430\nSo, I just went ahead and\n\n81\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.938\nI'm gonna pick on Newegg just\nbecause I'm familiar with them.\n\n82\n00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:54.018\nIf you are new to the industry, you\nreally should be familiar with something\n\n83\n00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:57.220\nlike Newegg as well because you\ncan get tons of components.\n\n84\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.100\nAnd they're really just not\nlimiting themselves anymore as\n\n85\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.660\nyou can see as some of\nthe things scroll by.\n\n86\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.170\nWe can get computers, and\nwe can get brake calipers for our cars.\n\n87\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.590\n&gt;&gt; Wes remember the old PC Shopper\nmagazine from back in the day?\n\n88\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.830\nThis is how we used to do it.\n\n89\n00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.510\nYou had to go to an actual bookstore or\na magazine seller of some sort.\n\n90\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.870\nAnd there was a magazine on\nthe shelf called PC Shopper.\n\n91\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.320\nIt was about yea thick.\n\n92\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.150\n&gt;&gt; You look at the index number and\nyou have to sit there and\n\n93\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.260\nlook at every little piece,\nnumber that you need.\n\n94\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.740\n&gt;&gt; I used to drool over that thing.\n\n95\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely,\nthis is a geek's dream, if you will.\n\n96\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.800\nAnd that's really what this is, too.\n\n97\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.820\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive\ninto one of the very first ones.\n\n98\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.710\nAnd we're gonna go shopping and\nso you guys can kind of identify.\n\n99\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.370\nNow when you're looking at the objectives,\nthis series of objectives,\n\n100\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.900\nlet me go ahead and call them out so\nyou guys know what we are talking about.\n\n101\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.580\nGiven a scenario :select the appropriate\ncomponents for a custom PC configuration\n\n102\n00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.140\nto meet customer specifications or needs.\n\n103\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.453\nNow, that's the official\nif you will objective.\n\n104\n00:04:58.453 --> 00:05:01.799\nWe just called it custom PCs because\nwe don't need a doctoral dissertation\n\n105\n00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:05.160\nthere at the bottom of your screen there\nwhen it comes to what we're doing.\n\n106\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.198\nSo, we're going to go through each one and\nwe're going to talk about these.\n\n107\n00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:11.160\nAnd then we're gonna give you examples of\nsome of the components that could see.\n\n108\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.350\nI want you to know for\n\n109\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.550\nthe exam, almost everything that you\nneed to know, is right in the objective.\n\n110\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.900\nSo check out our website definitely for\n\n111\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.580\nthe show notes cause we'll\nput the objectives up there.\n\n112\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.666\nAnd you can kind of go through these along\nwith us, you know, pause the video, and\n\n113\n00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.757\nthen check out some of these components.\n\n114\n00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:29.653\nSo the first thing they call out,\n\n115\n00:05:29.653 --> 00:05:33.220\nyou'll see is graphic cad\ncam design work station.\n\n116\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.150\nWow, we just never get away from acronyms,\ndo we here?\n\n117\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.746\nGraphics, right, if we're talking about\ngraphics we're talking about some\n\n118\n00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:42.248\nkind of machine that is gonna do,\n\n119\n00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:45.323\ncould be doing things like high\nend 3D you know rendering, right?\n\n120\n00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:49.600\nSo if you think of your 3D,\nlike Pixar, right?\n\n121\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.680\nPixar animation, well this is very,\nvery processor intensive but\n\n122\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.890\nits also intensive on the graphics card,\nright?\n\n123\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.150\nSo we need things like a multi-core\nprocessor And again, like I said,\n\n124\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.510\njust about every machine you have today,\n\n125\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.590\neven if it's a laptop's gonna\nhave a multicore processor.\n\n126\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.040\nBut how many of those cores do you need,\nand how powerful is the processor, or\n\n127\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.200\nthe processor needs to be,\ncould vary greatly.\n\n128\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.871\nThe other thing you need is\na high end video card, right?\n\n129\n00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.935\nA high-end video card is very\nimportant and as well maximum RAM.\n\n130\n00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:18.695\nSo let's go ahead and\njust kind of jump back and\n\n131\n00:06:18.695 --> 00:06:20.745\njust keep in mind graphics\nwe are talking about.\n\n132\n00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:23.335\nWe've got a lot of information\nthat we've got to process.\n\n133\n00:06:23.335 --> 00:06:27.760\nAnd so we need a beefy video system,\ngraphics system within it.\n\n134\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.820\nThey call out CAD, guys that's\njust computer aided design right.\n\n135\n00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.908\nAgain think about things like Pixar 3D\nanimations that's a lot of information.\n\n136\n00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:39.310\nIt doesn't seem like much but it's a lot\nof information that needs to be processed.\n\n137\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.360\nCAM is just computer assisted machinery.\n\n138\n00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.251\nIf you will, as well,\nor design if you will.\n\n139\n00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:49.080\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about the multicore processor.\n\n140\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.650\nNow, there is,\n\n141\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.560\nI'm sure there's a big debate on which\nprocessor you should buy for this.\n\n142\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.370\nI tell you, Intel versus AMD but\nIntel kinda wins out this.\n\n143\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.816\nI like AMD just because I\nlive on a working-man salary.\n\n144\n00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:07.190\nI can afford an AMD processor,\nand they do really well for me.\n\n145\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.060\nBut when it comes down to the nuts and\nbolts, Intel processors,\n\n146\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.050\nthere's a reason they have kinda cornered\nthe market for a very long time.\n\n147\n00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.580\nThey're very strong processors.\n\n148\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.361\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's do the first thing.\n\n149\n00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.310\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna dive\nin here and we're gonna look for a CPU.\n\n150\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.250\nSo let's go ahead, we're gonna do that,\nwe'll just search for CPUs.\n\n151\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.370\nNow we're gonna get all different\nkinds of things that we can look at.\n\n152\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.170\nYou'll see we got the big guys,\nright, we got Intel on one side.\n\n153\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.150\nAnd on the other side of\nthe tracks we end up having AMD.\n\n154\n00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.250\nNow, some of these processors I don't want\nyou to worry about on the exam because\n\n155\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.300\nthey're brand new, right?\n\n156\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.440\nThese are the latest and greatest,\n\n157\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.660\nthe objectives were before these\nprocessors were even invented.\n\n158\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.170\nHowever, there are some\nthat have been around for\n\n159\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.235\na little bit, like the FX and the Athlon.\n\n160\n00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.246\nAthlon's has been around for a long time.\n\n161\n00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:51.115\n&gt;&gt; A long time.\n\n162\n00:07:51.115 --> 00:07:51.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n\n163\n00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.004\nXeon, xeon is a server grade processor and\n\n164\n00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:56.883\nyou can also see this inside\na high end work stations.\n\n165\n00:07:56.883 --> 00:07:59.700\nRemember one of the big things\nabout a Xeon processor is the fact\n\n166\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.389\nthat you can have more than one processor,\nwe're not just talking multi-core.\n\n167\n00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:06.958\nEach processor will be a multi core\nprocessor, but you can have up to,\n\n168\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.910\nI believe, like eight of these processors\npotentially on the motherboard.\n\n169\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.900\n&gt;&gt; Some multi sockets.\n\n170\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Multi sockets,\nthat's a very good way to put it.\n\n171\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.830\nMulti CPU, multi core,\nmulti sockets on the board itself.\n\n172\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.070\nSo, let's go ahead and dive in here.\n\n173\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.290\nIf we look at something\nlike the i7 series.\n\n174\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.550\nThe i7 series, for a long time,\nhas been the staple of Intel for\n\n175\n00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.680\na very good, powerful processor.\n\n176\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.210\nAnd you can see, kind of,\nsome of the prices here, and\n\n177\n00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.220\nthese prices can get very, very expensive.\n\n178\n00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.910\nAlright?\n\n179\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.120\nAnd that might be something that\nyou have to consider, right?\n\n180\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.974\nWe look at, for instance, an i7 here.\n\n181\n00:08:39.974 --> 00:08:41.775\nYou got the 3.4 Gigahert, right?\n\n182\n00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:46.453\nThat's 3.4 billion calculations\nin a given second,\n\n183\n00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:49.670\nall right, so very, very powerful.\n\n184\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.860\nNow you have to look at your\nspecifications, right, and\n\n185\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.900\nthat's one of the great things that you\ncan do, you can compare and contrast.\n\n186\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.480\nBut let's go ahead and\ndive into one of these processors, and\n\n187\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.260\nlet's kind of see what's going on here.\n\n188\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.760\nRight, we said multicore processor,\nright, you can see right here, six cores.\n\n189\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.530\n12 threads.\n\n190\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.100\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n191\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.240\nAs we talked about in our CPU section,\n\n192\n00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.360\nkeep in mind that the core is\nthe physical little component chip.\n\n193\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.080\nRight?\nIt's like having multiple processing units\n\n194\n00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.380\nall built into a single CPU.\n\n195\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.320\nThe threads are the way\nthat you can logically,\n\n196\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.630\nthe operating system can pipe in\nstreams of data called threads,\n\n197\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.090\nsequential streams of\ninformation simultaneously.\n\n198\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.420\nSo according to the operating system, even\nthough physically on this chip we have 6\n\n199\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.290\nphysical cores, the operating system\nsees them as 12 individual cores.\n\n200\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.270\nAnd that's what we mean by logically.\n\n201\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.410\nPhysically, we talk about the hardware,\nlogically we talk about the software.\n\n202\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.580\nNow, the other thing I want you to keep\nin mind is that we also talked about, for\n\n203\n00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.650\ninstance, memory.\n\n204\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.500\nMemory's important, right?\n\n205\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.120\nSo if we look at memory, you can see here\nthis DDR4, it's one of the latest and\n\n206\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.960\ngreatest standards.\n\n207\n00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.600\nI don't want you to worry about DDR4 when\nit comes to this exam, because at the time\n\n208\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.850\nof this filming, in June 2017,\nDDR3 is really what's called out,\n\n209\n00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.010\na lot of times you'll see that A+\nwill go through a revision, and\n\n210\n00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.010\nthey will probably include the newer\nRAM in the next revision because DDR4\n\n211\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.290\nhas been standardized for\na while by it's been around.\n\n212\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.810\nBut I also want you to pay attention\nto the multi channel architecture.\n\n213\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.740\nThat's gonna be something\nthat's important.\n\n214\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.840\nRemember that each RAM module, right?\n\n215\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.590\nThat fits in a DIMM socket on\nthe motherboard is a 64-bit device.\n\n216\n00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.190\nAnd we talked about memory configurations\nin a previous episode that,\n\n217\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.370\nif I want to pipe more\ninformation into the CPU, right?\n\n218\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.210\nThe CPU's so fast,\nmemory can't keep up with it, right?\n\n219\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.960\nSo what they do is,\n\n220\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:41.580\nthey pipe in four channels of 64\nbits basically all at the same time,\n\n221\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.020\nthese are quad channel boards, and they\nare, they can be very, very expensive.\n\n222\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.300\nNow, you can go a little\nbit farther than this, too.\n\n223\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.340\nLike, we can go down, for instance, and\nwe can look at the specifications, and\n\n224\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.080\nyou can get, dig in a little bit deeper\nwhen it comes to the specifications.\n\n225\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.500\nNow, Dan, you made a good mention when\nwe were talking about mother boards,\n\n226\n00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.280\nwe were talking about, or CPUs and\nrelationship to the mother board.\n\n227\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.710\nHow do I know what CPU needs\nto be in a motherboard?\n\n228\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.950\nWell, you get a motherboard,\nand you turn around,\n\n229\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.750\nand you match the motherboard up to\nthe CPU, so that's important to keep in\n\n230\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.510\nmind that the thing you need\nattention too is the socket type.\n\n231\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.579\nNow even though some of these\nstandard we say are relatively new,\n\n232\n00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:22.250\nwe talked about the 2011 socket type,\nright, and\n\n233\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.900\nremember we talked about it being for\nthe i7 series and the Xeon processors.\n\n234\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.320\nNow, is this going to be\nsomething that you need, right?\n\n235\n00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.610\nAre there enough cores?\n\n236\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.860\nWell again, that depends.\n\n237\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.250\nThat depends on how much detail,\nhow powerful you need the computer.\n\n238\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.590\nThis might not be enough, right.\n\n239\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.480\nIntel's also got,\nif we back out for here just for\n\n240\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.330\na second, I believe we can find,\nyeah, there's the 10-core, right.\n\n241\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.020\nAnd if we do a 10-core,\nI thought they had an octa-core, but\n\n242\n00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.510\nit looks like they also\nhave the 10-Core too.\n\n243\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.290\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, with computer aided design and\n\n244\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.940\ncomputer aided manufacturing, having\nthe more cores is always recommended,\n\n245\n00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.750\nbecause this is a really intensive\ntype of processing, right?\n\n246\n00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.870\n&gt;&gt; It really is, Dan.\n\n247\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.830\nIf you're talking about\njust sending emails,\n\n248\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.620\nif you're talking about word processing\nlike you've mentioned in past episodes,\n\n249\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.910\nwe don't get to use all those cores,\nright?\n\n250\n00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.230\nI think, I know that you're into cars, and\n\n251\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.320\nI know that you've had some\npretty beefy cars in the past.\n\n252\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.090\nYou know, it's kind of like having\na supercharger on your car, and\n\n253\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.430\nyou're driving it 45 miles an hour,\nand you never step on the gas.\n\n254\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.350\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; What's the point of\n\n255\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.910\nhaving a supercharger and well\n&gt;&gt; That's debate and\n\n256\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.140\nwe always will be supercharged up.\n\n257\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.510\n&gt;&gt; But we see your line of reason.\n\n258\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.408\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:12:25.408 --> 00:12:26.182\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say,\n\n260\n00:12:26.182 --> 00:12:28.820\nI'm talking to the wrong person,\nof course you need five of them, but,\n\n261\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.295\n&gt;&gt; Worse than nitrous.\n\n262\n00:12:30.295 --> 00:12:31.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you don't get to open it up right,\n\n263\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.350\nyou don't get to open the car up and\ntake advantage of the power.\n\n264\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.620\nHowever, like Dan says, with something\nlike AutoCad, right, you know,\n\n265\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.100\nin a software, that is a specific type\nof software, computer data design.\n\n266\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.990\nYou're really gonna open this thing up,\nright?\n\n267\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.290\nYou're gonna use the supercharger,\nif you will.\n\n268\n00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.320\nAnd you can see, it comes with\na supercharge price too, right?\n\n269\n00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n270\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.380\n&gt;&gt; So you can see, we went from $300,\nall the way up to $1,400.\n\n271\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.650\nAnd we haven't even stopped there, right?\n\n272\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.080\nMaybe you need more processing power.\n\n273\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.680\nAnd what I mean by processing power is,\n\n274\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.990\nindividual cores aren't\ngoing to be enough, right?\n\n275\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.680\nMaybe, let's see if we can take\nthat out of there and back out,\n\n276\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.680\nwe'll do, you know,\nlet's see the Xeon processor.\n\n277\n00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.360\nSo let's go ahead, let's look for\nan Intel Xeon, right?\n\n278\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.080\nXeon with an m, and n not an m.\n\n279\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.550\nHehe, now when we look\nat these processors,\n\n280\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.690\nall right-\n&gt;&gt; Whoa ha-\n\n281\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.640\n&gt;&gt; Now we're talking about,\n\n282\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.970\nwe're bumping this up a little bit, right?\n\n283\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.250\nThe other thing to keep in mind\ntoo with these processors,\n\n284\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.340\nwhen they say powerful processors.\n\n285\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.510\nRemember, we talked about\nthe caching system, and\n\n286\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.990\nthat caching is very, very expensive.\n\n287\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.240\nCache costs cash if you will.\n\n288\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.020\nNotice that there are 18,\nyou'll see basically,\n\n289\n00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.055\nyou multiply that and I'm not even\ngoing to try that on camera here.\n\n290\n00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:44.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; L2 cache here.\n\n291\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:49.250\nSo we're talking about not only is this\nprocessor, very, very powerful, but\n\n292\n00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:55.830\nit also has a lot of caching memory,\nif you will, on it.\n\n293\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.050\nAnd if we look at the specifications\nthere, now we're bumping up in cores.\n\n294\n00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.419\nWhen we say bumping up in cores,\nguys, right, we're not kidding.\n\n295\n00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:07.582\nWe're talking an 18 core\nprocessor with 60, excuse me,\n\n296\n00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:14.436\n36 threads in it ,operating at 2.3\nbillion calculations in a given second,\n\n297\n00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:18.540\nso we're well beyond your average CPU,\nright?\n\n298\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.600\nAnd that's something that you might need.\n\n299\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.160\nThe other benefit, too,\nwith the Xeon processors, like I said,\n\n300\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.390\nis that you can stair stack multiple\nprocessors within the system.\n\n301\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.360\nNow that's a little bit about\na cad systems processor.\n\n302\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.720\nWhat about high end video?\n\n303\n00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.540\nNow there's a little bit of\na debate on this on, guys.\n\n304\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.790\nSo I want you to know for the exam.\n\n305\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.700\nYou do have dedicated CAD cards, okay.\n\n306\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.410\nLet me show you a graphics card here,\n\n307\n00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.430\nthat I believe is certified for\ncomputer aided design.\n\n308\n00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.260\nNow, let's see here,\ndo we have some, I believe, well,\n\n309\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.050\nwe have plenty of them here.\n\n310\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.370\nLet's go on up in price, all right.\n\n311\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.190\nWhen we talk about computer aided design,\n\n312\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:04.430\nwhat we're talking about is,\nyou could see the average video card.\n\n313\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.860\nThe average video card is good for\na custom gaming PC, perfect for\n\n314\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.790\na custom gaming PC.\n\n315\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.560\nAnd yes, they can get very expensive.\n\n316\n00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.916\nI mean, you look at this MSI\ncard here just by itself.\n\n317\n00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:16.890\nWe're talking $500.\n\n318\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but again, good for a gaming PC.\n\n319\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.665\n&gt;&gt; That's someone who takes\ntheir gaming real serious.\n\n320\n00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:23.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And to go even further than that,\n\n321\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.860\na lot of times what they do is an SLI\nconfiguration, single link interface or\n\n322\n00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.520\ncross fire.\n\n323\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.418\nDepending on if you're talking\nabout in video or ATI.\n\n324\n00:15:31.418 --> 00:15:34.690\nWe're talking about putting\nfour of these side by side.\n\n325\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.990\nSo in the gaming system,\nyou're talking about what,\n\n326\n00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.210\nyou have $2,000 in your\ngraphics cards alone?\n\n327\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.510\n&gt;&gt; Well it's not like it used to be,\nwhere we just gamed for fun.\n\n328\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.625\nNow we game for money.\n\n329\n00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:45.650\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's a business anymore, so\n\n330\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.310\nyou might be in that business and\nneed that card.\n\n331\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.460\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n332\n00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.469\nNow, when I said $2000 for\nyour graphics cards, let’s go ahead and\n\n333\n00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:58.009\nlet’s just, let’s show you something\nhere that’s probably gonna impress you.\n\n334\n00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:01.137\nI believe they still do have\na few of these up here, yeah.\n\n335\n00:16:01.137 --> 00:16:05.784\nOkay, so This is a card that would be for\nhigh end workstations and\n\n336\n00:16:05.784 --> 00:16:10.868\ninterestingly enough it doesn't even\nlook like they sell it here yet.\n\n337\n00:16:10.868 --> 00:16:12.331\nAll right, so-\n&gt;&gt; That's a rich man's candy right there.\n\n338\n00:16:12.331 --> 00:16:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, so yeah, we need, and\nwhen you're looking at the price of these,\n\n339\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.800\nladies and gentlemen, we're talking\nthe top of the line type of card, right?\n\n340\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Out of stock, that's why.\n\n341\n00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, out of stock.\n\n342\n00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.460\nApparently, somebody has a lot\nof money on their hands and\n\n343\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.670\nthey can buy a whole bunch of these.\n\n344\n00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.920\nSo again, you can see that CAD cards,\nagain with CAM cards,\n\n345\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.490\nthey could be very, very expensive.\n\n346\n00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.350\nAnd that's just a single card.\n\n347\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.001\nAgain, in some of these workstations\nwith multiple processors,\n\n348\n00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.920\nyou will turn around and see that\nthey could have multiple video cards.\n\n349\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.852\nI mean, this is kind of mind-boggling, but\n\n350\n00:16:47.852 --> 00:16:53.110\nwe're talking potential to have\n$20,000 in your graphics cards alone.\n\n351\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.013\nAnd then you look at the processors\nthat we looked at with the Xeon,\n\n352\n00:16:56.013 --> 00:17:00.950\nit's $2,700 a piece and we can put two or\nthree of these things on a single board.\n\n353\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.025\nIt's absolutely mind-boggling.\n\n354\n00:17:03.025 --> 00:17:04.313\nLet me show you real quick,\n\n355\n00:17:04.313 --> 00:17:07.516\ntoo, since we're talking about\nthe gaming work station, right?\n\n356\n00:17:07.516 --> 00:17:10.111\nWe're talking about the CAD work station.\n\n357\n00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:14.251\nLet's go up in here and\nlook at a Xeon board, cuz Dan,\n\n358\n00:17:14.251 --> 00:17:20.980\nyou made a good point that, hey, we're\ntalking about multiple sockets, all right?\n\n359\n00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.640\nLet's go ahead, and what we'll do,\nis we'll look at one of these Xeon boards.\n\n360\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.240\nLet's see if they have\nmultiple processors on them.\n\n361\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.980\n&gt;&gt; There's one right there.\n\n362\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.584\n&gt;&gt; Where?\n\n363\n00:17:29.584 --> 00:17:30.460\nYep, yep.\nThere we go.\n\n364\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.030\nWe got a few of them here, thank you.\n\n365\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.770\nGood eyes there, sir.\n\n366\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.970\nAll right, so\nlet's look at this board here.\n\n367\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.104\nWhen you're talking about\nhigh end work stations,\n\n368\n00:17:37.104 --> 00:17:40.520\nnotice what Dan was talking about,\nmultiple sockets on the motherboard.\n\n369\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.568\nAnd you can see that there are, what\nis it, four memory modules on this one?\n\n370\n00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:44.562\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n371\n00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:45.997\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I believe four memory so\n\n372\n00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:49.041\nthese are quad channel boards\nsupporting dual Xeon processors.\n\n373\n00:17:49.041 --> 00:17:52.563\nAgain you can see that for your CAD\nbase systems, your cam systems, and\n\n374\n00:17:52.563 --> 00:17:53.749\nyour graphic systems.\n\n375\n00:17:53.749 --> 00:17:58.227\nAgain, we're talking about a company\nthat could potentially make\n\n376\n00:17:58.227 --> 00:18:03.174\na $100 million releasing the next\nlatest and greatest film out there so\n\n377\n00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:08.850\nthey can definitely justify the cost, if\nyou will, to get this type of performance.\n\n378\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.480\nThis is not for the faint of heart.\n\n379\n00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.530\nAnd it certainly isn't for\n\n380\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:17.320\nyour average individual that is\nbasically on a working person's salary.\n\n381\n00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.330\nNow that being said, we also have to\nlook at RAM, all right, and RAM is very,\n\n382\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.100\nvery important.\n\n383\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.198\nSo you can see that when you are,\nand let me see if we got some here.\n\n384\n00:18:26.198 --> 00:18:30.074\nWe can show some additional things here.\n\n385\n00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:32.437\nYeah, so, I tell you want,\n\n386\n00:18:32.437 --> 00:18:37.660\nlet's look at the RAM amounts for\none of these boards here.\n\n387\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.550\nWe'll just take this one.\n\n388\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.160\nYou know what?\n\n389\n00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.070\nI think I seen a good one.\n\n390\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.340\nI think that might actually be\nserver class here too, okay.\n\n391\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.820\nYeah, so\nthis is a server-class motherboard.\n\n392\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.550\nAnd when you look at this type\nof motherboard, ladies and\n\n393\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.890\ngentleman, we're not messing around here.\n\n394\n00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.458\nLook how much memory you\ncan get on this board.\n\n395\n00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:59.000\nThere are 16 slots on this motherboard for\nRAM alone.\n\n396\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.250\nOkay, now again,\nthis is a server-grade type of board.\n\n397\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.080\nDo keep that in mind.\n\n398\n00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.040\nBut you also have to pay attention\nto maximum RAM when it comes to\n\n399\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.900\na system like this.\n\n400\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.250\nOther systems that you need maximum\nRAM for are gaming systems, right?\n\n401\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.520\nGaming systems require not only\nthe multi-core processors,\n\n402\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.320\nnot necessarily the Xeon processor.\n\n403\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.090\nAgain, those are server grade processors.\n\n404\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.080\nThey could be in your high\nend work stations, again,\n\n405\n00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.780\nfor computer-aided design.\n\n406\n00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:28.490\nBut not typically something that you're\ngonna see inside of your gaming rigs.\n\n407\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.410\nNow I've been talking\nabout Intel a little bit.\n\n408\n00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.478\nLet's show you the AMD side.\n\n409\n00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:36.950\nAnd we'll just do an AMD gaming CPU.\n\n410\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.810\nSome of these CPUs that you'll\nsee are going to be on the exam.\n\n411\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.310\nActually, this is an additional\nmotherboard tier 2.\n\n412\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:50.220\nSo gaming boards,\nlet's change that out here.\n\n413\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.900\nLet's just do AMD CPU, all right?\n\n414\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.360\nNow I get to show guys all of\nmy bad typing skills here.\n\n415\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.010\nAnd then I will just kind\nof look through here.\n\n416\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.770\nLet's see, I was gonna try to see and find\nsome of the older CPUs like the Phenom II,\n\n417\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.390\nbut that's okay.\n\n418\n00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.524\nHere we go, an FX series.\n\n419\n00:20:08.524 --> 00:20:12.510\nRight, the FX series was the AM3+ socket\nthat we talked about in our CPU section.\n\n420\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.060\nAgain, you can see things\nlike eight cores here.\n\n421\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.810\nAMD does theirs a little\nbit different than Intel.\n\n422\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.040\nIntel is the one that has hyper-threading.\n\n423\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.290\nAMD uses technologies called things\nlike HyperTransport, if you will.\n\n424\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.840\nIt's not a multithreading technology.\n\n425\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.910\nThey do have multithreading\ntechnology now, but\n\n426\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.660\nI certainly don't want you to\nworry about that for this exam.\n\n427\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.954\n&gt;&gt; They've got some great\nbranding people over at AMD, man.\n\n428\n00:20:34.954 --> 00:20:35.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n429\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.290\n&gt;&gt; They really know how to name\nsomething where you want it.\n\n430\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:38.800\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n431\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.618\n&gt;&gt; Look at this AMD Wraith\ncooler Vishera 8-core.\n\n432\n00:20:40.618 --> 00:20:41.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n433\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.524\n&gt;&gt; I mean I've got to\ngo buy that right now.\n\n434\n00:20:42.524 --> 00:20:44.813\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely a marketing thing.\n\n435\n00:20:44.813 --> 00:20:46.236\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Based on the name alone.\n\n436\n00:20:46.236 --> 00:20:49.540\n&gt;&gt; Sure, the other thing that they don't\ncall out when you're talking about\n\n437\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.500\nthese high end processors, I want you\nto look at how many watts, alright?\n\n438\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.840\nThat's not watts, there we go.\n\n439\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.669\n&gt;&gt; You have E-S-S watts.\n\n440\n00:20:58.669 --> 00:21:03.068\n[LAUGH] I don't know if that's a\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] who will make our own\n\n441\n00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:06.014\ncontributions to electrical science here.\n\n442\n00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:07.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n443\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.240\n&gt;&gt; So again,\nalso pay attention to the wattage, too,\n\n444\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.760\ncuz when you start talking about\nbeefing these processors up.\n\n445\n00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.222\nAnd by that I mean jargon is more power,\nthey require more power.\n\n446\n00:21:16.222 --> 00:21:22.808\nMore powerful processors require more\npower in the system collectively.\n\n447\n00:21:22.808 --> 00:21:27.674\nSo again, now we kind of talked a little\nbit about the multi-core processors,\n\n448\n00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:28.200\nright?\n\n449\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.760\nWe've talked about\nthe high-end video cards.\n\n450\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.221\nThe video cards, too,\nif I go back to that just for a second,\n\n451\n00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:39.419\nI want you to know that they\nalso call out things like, for\n\n452\n00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:42.414\ninstance, the GPUs, graphics cards.\n\n453\n00:21:42.414 --> 00:21:47.093\nOne of the things to keep in mind that\nbenefits us when we have these graphics\n\n454\n00:21:47.093 --> 00:21:52.020\ncards is that they have in them what's\nknown as the graphics processing unit.\n\n455\n00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.250\nAnd that's one of\nthe reasons we use these,\n\n456\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.110\ncuz of the way they calculate graphics.\n\n457\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.247\nThey do what is known as a parallel\ncomputing in the fact that they can do\n\n458\n00:22:00.247 --> 00:22:03.862\nmultiple things to a single bit of data\nversus a sequential stream of computing,\n\n459\n00:22:03.862 --> 00:22:05.530\nif you will, that a normal CPU does.\n\n460\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.989\n&gt;&gt; That's why they like to build\nhome supercomputers out of GPUs.\n\n461\n00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:11.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz is perfect for that kind of thing.\n\n462\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.328\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and in fact a lot of your\nuniversities now, because they can bring\n\n463\n00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:18.730\ndown the price of a supercomputer,\nthey do exactly what Dan says.\n\n464\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.440\nThey put 20,000 GPUs in it,\nyou might be, my gosh.\n\n465\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.188\nBut that's a lot different.\n\n466\n00:22:23.188 --> 00:22:25.980\nYou say, well,\nhow much did they spend on that system?\n\n467\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.276\nWell, they spent about $1 million.\n\n468\n00:22:27.276 --> 00:22:28.496\nYou're like whoa, wait a second.\n\n469\n00:22:28.496 --> 00:22:29.420\nHow's that saving money?\n\n470\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.430\nWell, if you look at the price of a Cray\ncomputer, you're talking things like\n\n471\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.650\nNASA's computers and stuff like that,\nand some of the high-end universities.\n\n472\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.345\nYou're talking 3 to $4 million for these.\n\n473\n00:22:38.345 --> 00:22:43.899\nSo again, we are talking about some very,\nvery expensive type of equipment.\n\n474\n00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:48.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's like saying take 70% off\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] What a savings!\n\n475\n00:22:48.928 --> 00:22:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n476\n00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.160\nSo some of the other things to keep\nin mind when it comes to these\n\n477\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.940\nspecialized systems, a gaming system, if\nyou will, also high end cooling systems.\n\n478\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.600\nAgain the level of cooling that\nyou need is really contingent.\n\n479\n00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.155\nI'll show you that you can get very,\nvery specific on this.\n\n480\n00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:15.206\nIf I do sub zero stage\nfour cooling system,\n\n481\n00:23:15.206 --> 00:23:22.490\nyou will see some pretty\nexpensive prices here.\n\n482\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.080\nAnd they can get, just it's mind boggling.\n\n483\n00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.150\nHere's one of them, and this again\nis an LCS Liquid Cooling System.\n\n484\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.285\nIf we view this image here,\nwe're talking about again,\n\n485\n00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:34.910\nhigh-end cooling,\nliquid cooling, if you will.\n\n486\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:39.690\nYou see water blocks that go on the CPU\nto dissipate in heat exchange systems,\n\n487\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.900\nradiators that go on your memory,\nradiators that go on your cars, and\n\n488\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.180\nthese reservoirs.\n\n489\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.000\nAnd it's just an active cooling system.\n\n490\n00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.614\nAgain, it can be very,\nvery, very, expensive.\n\n491\n00:23:48.614 --> 00:23:50.655\n&gt;&gt; Is this the system that we\nhave on the Thunder Lizard here?\n\n492\n00:23:50.655 --> 00:23:55.537\n&gt;&gt; No, I believe,\nif I look at it, I wanna say,\n\n493\n00:23:55.537 --> 00:24:01.974\nif we get back to our Newegg,\nif I do a Corsair Hydro Series.\n\n494\n00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:06.956\nI believe is what we have, and\nI can't remember if it's the H100,\n\n495\n00:24:06.956 --> 00:24:09.420\nI think, is what we have.\n\n496\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.683\nYeah, so you can see it here,\nHydro Series, and ours.\n\n497\n00:24:13.683 --> 00:24:14.329\nYeah, I think this is the 100.\n\n498\n00:24:14.329 --> 00:24:15.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the 100.\n\n499\n00:24:15.361 --> 00:24:19.185\nI believe this is what we have\ninside of our systems here at\n\n500\n00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:22.520\nthe computer that's in the server closet.\n\n501\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.620\nAnd again, you can see two radiators and\nthe water block.\n\n502\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.150\nNow, one of the great things about this\ntype of system is the fact that it's\n\n503\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.560\na self-contained unit,\n\n504\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.490\nunlike the one that we've seen before\nwhich is actually mult-components.\n\n505\n00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.230\nYou can go out to places\nlike Digital Storm and\n\n506\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.690\nthey build customized PCs like this.\n\n507\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.490\nYou gotta be careful because with\nthose you have to know that the pieces\n\n508\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.840\nhave very, very tight tolerances.\n\n509\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.630\nAnd just think about it, I mean you're\nrunning a liquid across electrical\n\n510\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.470\ncomponents, you really don't\nwant a leak in the system.\n\n511\n00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.410\nSo one of the great things about this\nIs this is what I would consider\n\n512\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.260\nan entry level liquid cooling system.\n\n513\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.160\nNow you might look at this and\n\n514\n00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.730\nbe a little intimidated by it but the good\nthing about it is with these types of\n\n515\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:59.160\nliquid cooling systems in gaming PCs\nit makes it really, really easy.\n\n516\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.480\nNow amongst other things,\n\n517\n00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.170\nin our gaming PCs we might need\nhigh definition sound right?\n\n518\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.580\nWe need a good sound card.\n\n519\n00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.670\nYou might have something like an audio and\nvideo editing station.\n\n520\n00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.160\nAnd when we talk about audio and\nvideo editing right,\n\n521\n00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:19.250\nagain, high end graphics cards as well for\nthe video editing part.\n\n522\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:23.660\nYou might end up needing something\nlike a surround sound, right?\n\n523\n00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:29.660\nSo if you talk about audio cards,\nthese can also get expensive.\n\n524\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.890\nThe functionality can be built\ninto the motherboard but\n\n525\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.600\nkeep in mind of this is your business.\n\n526\n00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.670\nChances are, you're not gonna be using\nan integrated type of system like this.\n\n527\n00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.090\nYou'll be using one of these\ndedicated cards like you see here.\n\n528\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.095\nAgain, I know Sound Blaster,\n\n529\n00:25:45.095 --> 00:25:50.350\nCreative Sound Blaster cards has been\naround for a pretty fairly long time.\n\n530\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.070\nYou can see this one right here sits\nat a PCI Express, one lane card.\n\n531\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:00.730\nAnd again, you can see that we're talking\nabout, I get a specialized audio card.\n\n532\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.965\nAnd again, that's for things like your\naudio and video editing work stations\n\n533\n00:26:04.965 --> 00:26:08.580\nagain, the same thing applies when you\ntalk about your video card itself.\n\n534\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.790\nIt's typically gonna be a card that\nis a little bit more expensive.\n\n535\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.210\nNow there are other types of systems\nthat we also wanna keep in mind as well.\n\n536\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.970\nWe have things like for instance,\nvirtualization workstations.\n\n537\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.880\nAnd when we talk about virtualized\nvirtualization workstations.\n\n538\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.460\nWe're talking about making sure that\nthe CPU supports virtualization.\n\n539\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.820\nIt needs maximum memory.\n\n540\n00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.140\nAnd that's the next thing\nthat we also have to look at.\n\n541\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.780\nIf we look at some of\nthe memory that's out there.\n\n542\n00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.230\nWe say DDR 4 memory modules.\n\n543\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.960\nYou have to keep in mind that these\nsticks will come in different sizes,\n\n544\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.030\nthe RAM modules themselves.\n\n545\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.880\nSo pay attention.\n\n546\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.640\nYou also have to pay attention to\nwhat the motherboard supports,\n\n547\n00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.900\njust because a motherboard has four slots.\n\n548\n00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.940\nIf we take a look here, you can see.\n\n549\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.190\nLet me see if I can find some.\n\n550\n00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.330\nLet's see here.\n\n551\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.750\nYeah, so let's find.\n\n552\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:05.140\nOkay, so you can see here capacity per\nmodule and we have 16 gigs per module.\n\n553\n00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.610\nThat doesn't necessarily mean because you\nhave four slots on the motherboard that\n\n554\n00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.590\nyou can put four 16 gig sticks in it,\n\n555\n00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.400\nbecause the motherboards only\naddress a certain amount of memory.\n\n556\n00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.910\nSo when you have things like your\nCAD graphics cam stations and\n\n557\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.730\nthey say maximum ram, you really need\nto pay attention to the motherboard.\n\n558\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.280\nYou talk about virtualization,\nworkstations, again,\n\n559\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.130\nthey need maximum RAM,\nthey also need maximum cores, too,\n\n560\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.130\nbecause you can do what\nare known as virtual cores, and\n\n561\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:36.010\nyou can allocate a single core or multiple\ncores to different virtual machines.\n\n562\n00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.200\nSo again, pay attention to the speeds.\n\n563\n00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.150\nMatch the speeds up with the motherboard.\n\n564\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:45.090\nAnd don't think again,\nright here just because one module\n\n565\n00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:49.010\nis a 16 module stick\nthat you're gonna be able\n\n566\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.960\nto populate that on the motherboard and\nthen address all of that memory.\n\n567\n00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.100\nAnd you can see that these get very,\nvery expensive very quick.\n\n568\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.480\nEspecially when you're talking about maybe\nhaving eight of these on a single board,\n\n569\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.570\nlike a virtualization workstation.\n\n570\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.790\nIt is something to keep in mind too.\n\n571\n00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.720\nOther things that we also need to keep in\nmind is when you have things like home\n\n572\n00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.700\ntheater PCs.\n\n573\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.330\nWe need things like surround audio and\nsome kind of surround sound.\n\n574\n00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.630\nAnd that's one of the good things.\n\n575\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:21.000\nIn fact, we've kinda seen that already\nwhen we look at the sound cards, here.\n\n576\n00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.660\nLet's see, audio card, again, let's go\nback and just briefly look at that.\n\n577\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.546\nYou notice the multiple ports, here,\n\n578\n00:28:31.546 --> 00:28:36.030\nthose are those TRS one-eighth inch jacks.\n\n579\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.214\nAnd notice all the different jacks here\ngives us the surround sound that we might\n\n580\n00:28:40.214 --> 00:28:42.161\nneed for an HTPC or a home theater PC.\n\n581\n00:28:42.161 --> 00:28:44.435\nHDMI output is important too.\n\n582\n00:28:44.435 --> 00:28:49.275\nThat's a functionality that could be\nintegrated into the motherboard itself\n\n583\n00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:53.950\nwith a home theater PC or it could\nbe part of an expansion card, right?\n\n584\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.470\nThat is also another thing.\n\n585\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.620\nThe other thing that you might\nneed inside of like, for\n\n586\n00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.710\ninstance, a home theater PC you might\nneed something known as a TB tuner card.\n\n587\n00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:08.310\nWe have talked about those tuner\ncards in a prior episode, but\n\n588\n00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:14.300\nkeep in mind what it does is it allows you\nto stream, basically tune into television\n\n589\n00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.370\nand you can stream at things like your\ncable TV right into the home theater PC.\n\n590\n00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.920\nIt allows you to basically\ntake that information.\n\n591\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.840\nYou can even output it to high\ndefinition monitors as well out to your\n\n592\n00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.350\nbig 55 inch TV if you end up having one.\n\n593\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.990\nSo those are a couple of things\nin the home theater PC as well.\n\n594\n00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.650\nI will tell you that there are couple\nother things that they call out.\n\n595\n00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.950\nThey call out what are known\nas standard thick clients and\n\n596\n00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.290\nthey call out what is\nknown as a thin client.\n\n597\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.675\nStandard thick client, guys,\n\n598\n00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:46.199\ngals out there,\nI want you to know it's a basic computer.\n\n599\n00:29:46.199 --> 00:29:47.215\nThat's your workstation.\n\n600\n00:29:47.215 --> 00:29:51.965\nYour average workstation, it basically\nruns your desktop applications and\n\n601\n00:29:51.965 --> 00:29:56.057\nit basically has to meet whatever\nthe minimum requirements are for\n\n602\n00:29:56.057 --> 00:29:58.115\nthe selected operating system.\n\n603\n00:29:58.115 --> 00:30:01.680\nSo if you're running Windows,\nWindows has a very low requirement,\n\n604\n00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.400\nminimum recommended requirement,\nI think it's like one gig of RAM.\n\n605\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.520\nHowever, just because you meet\nthe minimum requirements,\n\n606\n00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.160\nthe operating system doesn't mean you're\ngonna get a good computing experience.\n\n607\n00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.480\nSo, also keep that in mind that just\nbecause you meet the minimums doesn't mean\n\n608\n00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.350\nyou should stay with the minimums.\n\n609\n00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:20.090\nAgain, I typically recommend\ntoday a minimum of four gigs,\n\n610\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.426\nhowever with 64 bit being so prevalent,\n\n611\n00:30:22.426 --> 00:30:27.310\nI mena, six, eight gigs is perfectly\nfine for a standard thick client.\n\n612\n00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.115\nAnd that is the opposite of what's\nknown as a thin client, all right.\n\n613\n00:30:30.115 --> 00:30:32.472\nWhen we look at what's\nknow as a thin client,\n\n614\n00:30:32.472 --> 00:30:35.460\na thin client is a machine that\nis very small form factor.\n\n615\n00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.229\nIn fact yeah, there we go,\nwe got a thin client right here.\n\n616\n00:30:38.229 --> 00:30:40.388\nActually they got kind of a lot\nof power by today's means.\n\n617\n00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:43.230\nI know you probably seen some of\nthe thin clients over the years.\n\n618\n00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.630\nAnd a thin client is a very\nstreamlined machine.\n\n619\n00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.790\nIt has very limited resources and that's\nkind of a [LAUGH] joke when you look at\n\n620\n00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.740\nthese thin clients,\ncuz they actually have beefed them up.\n\n621\n00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.620\nI've seen some that In the past it had\nless than a gig of RAM quite literally.\n\n622\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.083\nBecause they're not running their own,\n\n623\n00:30:58.083 --> 00:30:59.893\nthey might be running their\nown operating system.\n\n624\n00:30:59.893 --> 00:31:04.823\nA very slimmed down highly optimized\noperating system that runs with very\n\n625\n00:31:04.823 --> 00:31:08.170\nlimited memory, and\nalmost zero local storage.\n\n626\n00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.120\nI've seen them even more with the\noperating system is actually pulled down\n\n627\n00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.260\nto the machine off of a server and loaded\nat the time that you log into the device\n\n628\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.950\nand then once you shut the device down,\nthe operating system is gone.\n\n629\n00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:22.810\nSo again thin clients, they meet\nthings like your basic applications,\n\n630\n00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.090\nthey talk about meets the minimum\nrequirements for the operating system.\n\n631\n00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:30.350\nAgain, it depends on what the thin\nup OS the thin client is running.\n\n632\n00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.810\nA lot of times these are specialized\n\n633\n00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.030\nadditions of your different\noperating systems.\n\n634\n00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.930\nAgain, very,\nvery small footprint if you will.\n\n635\n00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.510\nThe other thing to keep in\nmind too is that thin clients\n\n636\n00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.890\nneed good network connectivity, cuz a lot\nof times that's what they are doing.\n\n637\n00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.750\nThey're connecting over the network to\n\n638\n00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:52.950\nanother massive computer that's actually\nrunning the operating system for them.\n\n639\n00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.070\nAnd I believe if we look,\nI think this is a, yeah, so\n\n640\n00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.930\nyou can see that this has the RJ 45\njack and this is a gigabyte connection.\n\n641\n00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.060\nIf I remember seeing right.\n\n642\n00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:07.233\nYeah, so it's got Gigabit Ethernet,\nnot gigabyte, excuse me, Gigabit Ethernet.\n\n643\n00:32:07.233 --> 00:32:09.751\nAnd notice that it says it's\nrunning Windows 10 embedded, right.\n\n644\n00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:14.180\nThat's that slimline Windows 10 that's not\nthe full blown home edition if you will\n\n645\n00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.564\nof Windows 10 certainly not pro\n[CROSSTALK], that's right, so\n\n646\n00:32:17.564 --> 00:32:20.716\nyou're gonna have a little bit\nof a limited functionality.\n\n647\n00:32:20.716 --> 00:32:23.224\nNow, Dan I know we're running out of time,\nbut\n\n648\n00:32:23.224 --> 00:32:27.319\nwe do have one last one that we wanna\ntalk about and that's the home server PC.\n\n649\n00:32:27.319 --> 00:32:31.835\nWhen we talk about the home\nserver PC just like the audio and\n\n650\n00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:36.168\nvideo station, keep in mind,\nthat storage is a very big\n\n651\n00:32:36.168 --> 00:32:41.300\nconsideration with home media servers,\nif you will.\n\n652\n00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.910\nAnd basically a media server doesn't have\nto be anything that's in a server closet.\n\n653\n00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.550\nIt could just be a normal workstation,\n\n654\n00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.760\nbut there are things that\nare specific to it, right?\n\n655\n00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.550\nIt has to perform things\nlike media streaming.\n\n656\n00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.790\nCould be a TV tuner card, you might have\nthings where its storing information like\n\n657\n00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.330\nfiles, so you do file sharing.\n\n658\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.210\nShare your photos over\nthe network if you will.\n\n659\n00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.140\nAs well as print sharing.\n\n660\n00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.910\nYou might have a printer in your house,\n\n661\n00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.640\nand it's controlling what\nprint jobs go to the printer.\n\n662\n00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.180\nSo, that might be something that you need.\n\n663\n00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.490\nKeep that in mind that if its a wired\nconnection you need your ethernet\n\n664\n00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.210\nnetwork jack in the PC itself.\n\n665\n00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.780\nIf it's a wireless connection then it has\nto support the wireless functionality.\n\n666\n00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.970\nOr you can add that functionality\nby adding a wireless card\n\n667\n00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.910\nto an expansion slot.\n\n668\n00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.410\nGigabit NIC as well, because there's gonna\nbe a lot of people, could be potential for\n\n669\n00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.950\na lot of people connecting to it.\n\n670\n00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.750\nAnd more so today, because there's a lot\nof high definition video out there,\n\n671\n00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.820\nyou need the gigabit NIC,\nbecause it allows more information.\n\n672\n00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.820\nEspecially that high\ndefinition streaming media\n\n673\n00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.950\nto just give you a better performance.\n\n674\n00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.590\nAnd it's the same thing with the audio and\nvideo when it comes to storage.\n\n675\n00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.490\nYou need a large capacity\ndrive if you will,\n\n676\n00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.990\nand this is where it differs a little bit.\n\n677\n00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.120\nIf you're talking about\nan audio video station,\n\n678\n00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.700\nthen you want things like\na solid state drive drive,\n\n679\n00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.150\ncuz you need not only a large drive,\nyou need a fast drive right to do.\n\n680\n00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.380\nThe processing, if you will, and\nget to that information quicker.\n\n681\n00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.560\nOn the home PC, the home server PC,\n\n682\n00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.500\nyou don't necessarily\nneed a solid state drive.\n\n683\n00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.340\nIt's great to have.\n\n684\n00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.160\nIn fact, I kinda recommended it to one\nof the other hosts here who's actually\n\n685\n00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.880\nbuilding a home media server right now.\n\n686\n00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.494\nAnd again, because one of the two of\nthe main components that we need here is\n\n687\n00:34:17.494 --> 00:34:20.218\na fast network adapter, a fast hard drive.\n\n688\n00:34:20.218 --> 00:34:23.690\nAnd the reason I say that is, because the\nhard drive is what is storing your videos,\n\n689\n00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.816\nand your photos, and when people\nare connecting to it the faster that drive\n\n690\n00:34:26.816 --> 00:34:30.140\nthe faster they can get to it\nthe better experience they have.\n\n691\n00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:35.173\nLast thing for the home server PC is\ntypically some kind of raid array.\n\n692\n00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:40.030\nIf you have all of your photos,\nall of your movies if you will.\n\n693\n00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.220\nChances are you want a little\nbit of fault tolerance, so\n\n694\n00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.680\nthat if one of the drives fails,\nyou still have access to your information.\n\n695\n00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.300\nYou don't lose all your information.\n\n696\n00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.390\nNow, if the information that is on that\nhome server PC, maybe isn't important\n\n697\n00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:58.950\nto you, then you can also do a RAID\nzero where it's performance.\n\n698\n00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:03.167\nThat will be up to you and again keep\nin mind the more drives that we add,\n\n699\n00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.669\nthe different rate arrays we can obtain,\n\n700\n00:35:05.669 --> 00:35:08.630\nlike a array ten also\nbrings the price point up.\n\n701\n00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.410\nDo keep that in mind.\n\n702\n00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.010\nLet me see if I forgot anything down here,\nI know,\n\n703\n00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.230\nwe got a few things in maybe the audio and\nvideo workstation.\n\n704\n00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:20.790\nThe last thing that I might mention is\ndual monitors that's almost a must today.\n\n705\n00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.130\nDual monitors means,\nmore real estate in front of you,\n\n706\n00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.370\nit means a little bit more productivity.\n\n707\n00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:30.090\nAnd that really is just contingent not so\nmuch on the monitors themselves,\n\n708\n00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:35.560\nmore as it is contingent on\nthe graphics card supporting it.\n\n709\n00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.530\nAnd most of all your modern graphics\ncards, even the integrated functionality\n\n710\n00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:43.730\nof the motherboard will support\nsome kind of multi-monitor setup.\n\n711\n00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:44.770\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, Wes.\n\n712\n00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:49.340\nWe do thank you for showing us how to\nbuild out a custom PC, and the different\n\n713\n00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.440\ntypes of custom PCs that we might run\ninto out in the field as A+ technicians.\n\n714\n00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.350\nThat being said, it looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n715\n00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.980\nWe do thank you for joining us.\n\n716\n00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.530\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n717\n00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n718\n00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.459\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next

00:00:08.414\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:12.192\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:14.016\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.470\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.131\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.298\nin today's episode we are killing\nit with more of our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:24.196\nOur 22901, that is,\nif you're paying attention, and\n\n10\n00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:28.180\njoining us in the studio to help us pay\nattention, our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.220\nWes it's good to have you again, man.\n\n12\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.262\n&gt;&gt; And you are throwing a lot\non me to pay attention.\n\n13\n00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:34.303\nThat's right, I'm so\nbroke I can't even pay attention.\n\n14\n00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:37.198\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, guys, welcome back, and\n\n15\n00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:40.570\nwe are continuing along,\njust like Dan said, in our A+ series.\n\n16\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.040\nAnd we are really focused in on\nthat first certification exam.\n\n17\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.931\nWe're gonna be continuing through, if you\nare, like Dan said, following along with\n\n18\n00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.521\nus, you've probably seen that we've\nbeen spending a lot of time in hardware.\n\n19\n00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:55.510\nWell, the first exam really has to\ndo a lot with the hardware itself.\n\n20\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.872\nDoesn't mean you're not gonna see the\noperating system, but for the most part,\n\n21\n00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:02.089\nwe're gonna be looking at those components\nthat overall make up our computing\n\n22\n00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:02.690\nexperience.\n\n23\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.897\nAnd what we're gonna be diving in today\nis how we really see what's going on in\n\n24\n00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:11.350\nthe computing experience, and\nthat's gonna be display devices.\n\n25\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.980\nThere are many different\ntypes of displays out there,\n\n26\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.562\nall different kinds of manufacturers,\nif you will.\n\n27\n00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:20.880\nAnd the technology has definitely changed\nthroughout the years, and we have to\n\n28\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.430\nbe aware of some of these components,\nif you are gonna sit that exam.\n\n29\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.330\nSo one of the first ones\nthat we're gonna talk about,\n\n30\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.553\nI am glad to see, is no longer\non the exam anymore [LAUGH], and\n\n31\n00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:34.473\nthat's something known as\nthe old cathode ray tube.\n\n32\n00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:38.830\nThese cathode ray tubes, also called\nCRT monitors, these are the big,\n\n33\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.600\nbig monitors that were very, very heavy,\nthey weren't space savers, if you will.\n\n34\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.438\nThank goodness today, because they're\nkind of a really old technology,\n\n35\n00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:53.135\nthey have ceased to be on our exam.\n\n36\n00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:56.588\nBut we just wanted to mention them here,\njust briefly, so\n\n37\n00:01:56.588 --> 00:02:01.180\nthat you understand that at a certain\npoint, we moved into a couple of types.\n\n38\n00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.930\nThe types that are on the exam are gonna\nbe what is known as the LCD screen,\n\n39\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.360\nand the LED screen.\n\n40\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.650\nDan, I don't even think I can get five\nminutes into any episode with an A+,\n\n41\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.660\nwithout a little bit of acronym and\nalphabet soup.\n\n42\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they definitely love\nthe acronyms in our line of biz, so\n\n43\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.735\nif you don't like it,\nthat's a really tough thing to swallow.\n\n44\n00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:22.540\nBecause you're gonna\nhave to get used to it.\n\n45\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.891\n&gt;&gt; And that's Dan's way of saying, tough.\n\n46\n00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.163\nSo guys, and again, just keep in mind,\nlearning the new lingo,\n\n47\n00:02:28.163 --> 00:02:31.390\njust like any profession that\nyou might be striving to get in.\n\n48\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.807\nSo these acronyms will become\nyesterday's news once you start to\n\n49\n00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.823\nacclimate yourself to them.\n\n50\n00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.249\nSo what do we mean when we say LCD,\n\n51\n00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:45.728\nwhat we're talking about is something\nknown as a liquid crystal display.\n\n52\n00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:49.304\nAnd when we talk about LEDs,\nwe're talking about light emitting diodes.\n\n53\n00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:51.625\nLight emitting diodes,\nyou've probably seen them before, in fact,\n\n54\n00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.182\nthey're kinda popular\ntoday in flashlights.\n\n55\n00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:57.455\nI know Dan and I were talking about\nthe old Maglites, real bright light today.\n\n56\n00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:01.734\nBut they're really moving\naway from a traditional bulb,\n\n57\n00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:04.714\ninto these really ultra-bright LEDs.\n\n58\n00:03:04.714 --> 00:03:07.380\nWell, that forms, really,\nthe basis for the LED monitors and\n\n59\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.195\nhow they're lit today.\n\n60\n00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:14.390\nNow, when we talk about LCD screen, a\nliquid crystal display, I want you to know\n\n61\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.890\nthat there are certain components within\nit that you kinda wanna be aware of.\n\n62\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.682\nIn fact, I've got a little\nbit of a diagram here, and\n\n63\n00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:24.667\nwhat you have with liquid crystal\ndisplays is, you have a series of layers.\n\n64\n00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:28.414\nNow, I don't think that every individual\nlayer by any means is gonna be on\n\n65\n00:03:28.414 --> 00:03:28.966\nthe exam.\n\n66\n00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:30.331\nBut it is kinda of good to know,\n\n67\n00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.860\nthere'll be a couple of things\nthat we wanna be aware of.\n\n68\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.500\nLike for instance, when you look at\nthese LCDs, and LED screens, for\n\n69\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.840\nthat matter, they have what's known as\nan anti-reflective layer on the top.\n\n70\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.979\nAnd I wanna take a second just to talk\nabout that anti-reflective layer,\n\n71\n00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:50.316\ncuz we gotta be really, really careful on\nhow you clean the surface of an LCD or\n\n72\n00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:54.747\nLED screen, because that anti-reflective\nlayer can actually get damaged.\n\n73\n00:03:54.747 --> 00:03:59.562\nSo you want to make sure that you\nare using things like lint free cloths,\n\n74\n00:03:59.562 --> 00:04:00.452\nif you will.\n\n75\n00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:03.767\nThey have pre-moistened wipes that\nare out there, microfibers are very,\n\n76\n00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:06.690\nvery popular today, really,\nreally good way to clean these off.\n\n77\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.430\nBut keep in mind, be very, very careful.\n\n78\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.086\nNow, as you go through the different\nlayers, you can see a polarizing layer.\n\n79\n00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:17.869\nYou can see a glass layer, color filters,\nif you will, liquid crystal layer as well.\n\n80\n00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:23.737\nAnd when we get down to these two layers,\nand it's actually both in LEDs and LCDs.\n\n81\n00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:26.809\nWe'll talk about really what the\ndifference is between these two types here\n\n82\n00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:27.723\ncoming up in a second.\n\n83\n00:04:27.723 --> 00:04:31.762\nYou'll see TFT layer, there we go with\nthe acronyms again, what does that mean?\n\n84\n00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:35.433\nWell, that's actually something\nknown as a thin film transistor, and\n\n85\n00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:38.392\nit is something that’s specific\nto LCDs and LED screens.\n\n86\n00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:41.957\nWhat it means is that every\nsingle pixel that you see within\n\n87\n00:04:41.957 --> 00:04:45.169\nthat screen has a transistor\nthat’s related to it.\n\n88\n00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.793\nSo you get a much better picture\nthan you did in the earlier days,\n\n89\n00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:52.070\nespecially with the earlier CRT monitors.\n\n90\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.542\nNow, with an LCD screen, the other thing\nthat I want you to know is that yes,\n\n91\n00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:56.573\nwe have a glass layer,\n\n92\n00:04:56.573 --> 00:04:59.857\nanother polarizing layer, so\nkinda sandwiching on itself, really.\n\n93\n00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:04.238\nAnd one of the last ones we have, very,\nvery important, now, on the exam,\n\n94\n00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:06.792\nthey call out what is\nknown as fluorescent.\n\n95\n00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:11.284\nBasically, they just say fluorescent,\nthey don't say anything, well,\n\n96\n00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:12.559\nwhat does that mean.\n\n97\n00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:13.928\n&gt;&gt; Really helpful and\ndescriptive, isn't it?\n\n98\n00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:14.946\n&gt;&gt; It really is, right?\n\n99\n00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:19.008\nSo, let's see if we can help you with\nwhat fluorescent means, excuse me,\n\n100\n00:05:19.008 --> 00:05:20.110\nif I can even say it.\n\n101\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.139\nMore specifically,\nit's something known as a CCFL.\n\n102\n00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.690\nAgain, CCFL is something known as\na cold cathode fluorescent lamp.\n\n103\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.926\nNow, that's how an LCD screen is lit,\nand you might say, well,\n\n104\n00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:32.785\nWes, what the heck is that?\n\n105\n00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:33.970\nDan, what are we talking about?\n\n106\n00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.993\nWell, I want you to look,\nif you've ever seen the glass,\n\n107\n00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:39.712\nfluorescent bulbs that\nare in buildings and stuff,\n\n108\n00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:43.073\nthe concept is absolutely the same,\njust more on a micro scale.\n\n109\n00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:45.599\nWe're not talking about\nthe 19-inch fluorescent lamp,\n\n110\n00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.730\nwe're talking about very, very small.\n\n111\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.234\nAnd that is something that\nis common to the LCDs.\n\n112\n00:05:52.234 --> 00:05:55.094\nAnd the LCD's,\nthey're still used today, but\n\n113\n00:05:55.094 --> 00:05:57.897\npretty much very popular up to about 2010.\n\n114\n00:05:57.897 --> 00:06:00.315\nAnd with the cold cathode\nflourescent lamps,\n\n115\n00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:03.977\nthey're either placed on the opposite\nends to provide the lighting.\n\n116\n00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:07.677\nOr, you can have an entire array of\nthem in the back, that's difference\n\n117\n00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:11.620\nbetween what they call side lighting and\nwhat they call back lighting.\n\n118\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.750\nSo if they're back lit, then what you have\nis a series of, almost looks like ladders.\n\n119\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.423\nIf you were to strip off all these layers\nand you were looking at the bulbs,\n\n120\n00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:24.510\nit would look like two series of ladders,\nalmost like you could climb up them, and\n\n121\n00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.960\nit's just little strips\nof fluorescent lamps.\n\n122\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.140\nNow that's something to keep in mind, now\nsomething about fluorescent back lighting,\n\n123\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.730\nif you will, with the LCD screens is\nthat it does require some more power.\n\n124\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.266\nSee fluorescent bulbs,\nif you're not aware of them,\n\n125\n00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:39.417\nthey have a balustrade\non the back of them, and\n\n126\n00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:42.687\nthat provides the electricity to\nessentially light the lamp itself.\n\n127\n00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:45.842\nThat's why sometimes when you see\nthat the light starts to dim,\n\n128\n00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:49.591\nthat might not necessarily be the fact\nthat it's the bulb that's failing.\n\n129\n00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:53.729\nIt could be the balustrade, the electrical\ncomponent that connects to it, well,\n\n130\n00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.200\nthat takes a lot of power.\n\n131\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.910\nAnd that is one of the drawbacks\nto the LCD screens,\n\n132\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.140\nis that they are really,\nreally power hungry.\n\n133\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.790\nNow the other thing to keep in mind\nwith an LCD based screen is that,\n\n134\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.750\nnot only do they require more power,\nbut they're also thicker.\n\n135\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.480\nIf you've gone into any one of your\nelectronic stores today, doesn't matter,\n\n136\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.820\nstop by Best Buy or Walmart or\nany of them out there.\n\n137\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.760\nYou might notice that we have ultra thin\nTVs, televisions and monitors, today.\n\n138\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.707\nWell that typically isn't going to be an\nLCD screen, just because of the fact that\n\n139\n00:07:25.707 --> 00:07:29.954\nwe've got those fluorescent bulbs\nthat are inside of the LCD screen.\n\n140\n00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:33.144\nSo not only are they a little bit\nthicker and a little bit bulkier,\n\n141\n00:07:33.144 --> 00:07:36.691\none of the things to keep in mind too\nis that they have a shorter lifespan.\n\n142\n00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:40.271\nCuz just like any device,\nthink about a flashlight, and\n\n143\n00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:43.627\nagain, it's more prevalent\nto see even LEDs today,\n\n144\n00:07:43.627 --> 00:07:48.835\nbut if you think about a flashlight that\nhad the bulbs, the bulbs could go bad.\n\n145\n00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.761\nWell, it's really no different\nthan the LCD monitors, so\n\n146\n00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.349\nthe lifetime of the monitor\nis a little bit shorter.\n\n147\n00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:58.034\nNow, I know probably what some of you are\nsaying, Dan, and I have to keep this in\n\n148\n00:07:58.034 --> 00:08:01.282\nthe back of my head too, is that\nI've had a monitor now for 10 years.\n\n149\n00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:02.433\nIt's LCD.\n\n150\n00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:04.814\nSo you're saying, well,\nwait a second, a short lifespan.\n\n151\n00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:06.148\nWell, I mean I guess it's\nkinda like a crap shoot-\n\n152\n00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:07.220\n&gt;&gt; Shorter than what?\n\n153\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n154\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.070\nAs opposed to, I don't know,\nthe lifetime of the Earth.\n\n155\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.610\nI'm not sure.\n\n156\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:18.960\nBut again, keep in mind that when we talk\nabout the CCFL or the LCD-based screen,\n\n157\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.990\nmore power, a little bit more bulkier and\nas well, shorter lifetime.\n\n158\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.030\nNow the other thing to keep in mind,\n\n159\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.970\nI want you to think about when you reach\nover and your turn a fluorescent bulb on.\n\n160\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.140\nMaybe in your kitchen and\nyou flip the light on.\n\n161\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.400\nSome of you out there might notice\nthat the light comes on right away.\n\n162\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.440\nHow many have you ever seen where it takes\na little bit for the light to come on?\n\n163\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.619\nThat's the other thing about an LCD\nlight compared to the LED screens,\n\n164\n00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:44.300\nthey have a higher latency.\n\n165\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.935\nLatency or delay or like I say delatency\n[LAUGH] is just basically the fact\n\n166\n00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:52.060\nthat let's say that you're in a game,\nright.\n\n167\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.100\nYou're the gamer, right.\n\n168\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.160\nIf you were the gamer you're\nprobably building your machine but\n\n169\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.490\nyou've bought a gaming system.\n\n170\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.530\nYou don't want to spend a lot of money\non your gaming system only to get\n\n171\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.710\nless frames per second.\n\n172\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.050\nWe'll talk about frame\nrate here coming up right.\n\n173\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.870\nBut you want to get as much\nspeed out of it as you can,\n\n174\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.270\nso LCD screens again maybe\nrelative to the human eye.\n\n175\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.950\nYou don't see the latency,\nbut you can certainly see it\n\n176\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.715\nwhen you're talking about milliseconds and\nthe nanoseconds,\n\n177\n00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:19.585\nwhich is really what our computer\ncomponents are measured in, right?\n\n178\n00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:23.065\nStorage devices are measured in\nmilliseconds, things like your RAM,\n\n179\n00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:25.665\nyour CPU or measuring in nano seconds and\n\n180\n00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:29.977\nwhen you spend the extra money to get\nbetter performance out of your machine,\n\n181\n00:09:29.977 --> 00:09:34.177\nyou could be doing yourself some injustice\nby using one of the LCD screens.\n\n182\n00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:39.077\nNow, at the time, popular if you will,\nvery very popular is the replacement\n\n183\n00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:41.767\nof the old CRTs,\nwhen we moved into LCDs, right?\n\n184\n00:09:43.078 --> 00:09:46.668\nBut now we have what are known as LEDs.\n\n185\n00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:47.918\nAnd you know what, let me go ahead,\n\n186\n00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:53.528\nlet me talk about another thing too\nthat also is common with LCDs and LEDs.\n\n187\n00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:58.050\nAnd that's a couple of\nterms known as TM and IPS.\n\n188\n00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.220\nAll right, so what do we mean?\n\n189\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.310\nWell, when I say IPS,\n\n190\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.070\nI'm not talking about like something\nthat's in beer, that's IPUs, right?\n\n191\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.120\nWhen we're talking about IPS.\n\n192\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.610\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking intrusion protection,\nright?\n\n193\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Very good!\n\n194\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.690\nI never even draw a fact.\n\n195\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.250\nThat's right, you don't have an intrusion\nprotection system on your monitor,\n\n196\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.240\nbut we'll talk about\nthe older technology first.\n\n197\n00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.350\nThe twisted nematic,\nthat's what TN stands for.\n\n198\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.260\nAnd I certainly don't think they\nshould get that specific on the exam,\n\n199\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.320\nbut just know TN is a monitor or\ndisplay related technology.\n\n200\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.950\nAnd there's something about it,\nit's one of the most common.\n\n201\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.010\nIt's also one of the most\noldest implementations.\n\n202\n00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.470\nIt has very short response times, right?\n\n203\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.320\nSo lower latency.\n\n204\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.700\nThe other thing to keep in mind,\ntoo is that twisted nematic based\n\n205\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.815\nscreens also has higher brightness and\nwe're gonna talk about brightness and\n\n206\n00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:46.550\nlumens because that get a little tricky\non what they actually mean there.\n\n207\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.220\nIt has a less power draw so,\nagain, lower power,\n\n208\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.150\nvery, very good, if you will, for gaming.\n\n209\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.200\nHere's the drawback, right?\n\n210\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.490\nWe always talk about this, Dan.\n\n211\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.920\nWe say, okay,\nwell if it's good, good, good,\n\n212\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.360\ngood, there's gotta be a bad\nin there somewhere, right?\n\n213\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.300\nAnd that's the viewing angle.\n\n214\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.930\nNow, it's not as bad as\nthe earlier passive matrix screens\n\n215\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.480\non laptops and stuff that you had to sit\nright in front of it to be able to see it.\n\n216\n00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.100\nBut the viewing angle isn't as great.\n\n217\n00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.740\nSo if I was to move to the side here and\nthen move to the other side,\n\n218\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.680\nyou're seeing that\nthe screen kind of dims out.\n\n219\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.670\nSo that is one of the drawbacks\nof the twisted nematic.\n\n220\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.640\nNow, they have the IPS, right?\n\n221\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.400\nWe kind of joked around, it doesn't\nmean intrusion prevention system.\n\n222\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.998\nWhat is means is in-plane switching.\n\n223\n00:11:29.998 --> 00:11:34.360\nNow with In-plane switching,\nagain this has better color.\n\n224\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.510\nTwisted nematic, and my modem mentioned\nthat too, a twisted nematic doesn't have\n\n225\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:44.460\nthe bright very vibrant colors\nof the newer IPS based machines.\n\n226\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.000\nAnd guess what?\n\n227\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.560\nIt also has a better viewing angle, right?\n\n228\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.310\nAnd that's the great thing, is that being\nto one side of the monitor doesn't really\n\n229\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.820\nhinder the overall viewing experience.\n\n230\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.710\nThe last thing I want you to keep\nin mind about in plane switching\n\n231\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.910\nis that it has lower contrast ratios,\nwhich is what is a good thing.\n\n232\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.363\nWhen you talk about a contrast ratio,\n\n233\n00:12:05.363 --> 00:12:10.665\nthat's a ratio between the brightest color\nyou see and the darkest color you see.\n\n234\n00:12:10.665 --> 00:12:12.492\nSo please do keep that in mind.\n\n235\n00:12:12.492 --> 00:12:15.612\nAnd actually I got that backwards,\nlet me restate that.\n\n236\n00:12:15.612 --> 00:12:17.359\nHigher contrast ratio is better.\n\n237\n00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:18.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why I\n\n238\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.070\nmentioned it that way,\nhigher contrast ratio.\n\n239\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.960\nAgain, better color if you will,\nwe're talking about\n\n240\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.970\nthat ratio between the highest, or\nthe brightest color and the darkest color.\n\n241\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.331\nSo those are some of the that\nyou can see inside of, for\n\n242\n00:12:32.331 --> 00:12:35.705\ninstance, things like LCDs and\nLED screens, okay.\n\n243\n00:12:35.705 --> 00:12:39.470\nLet's go ahead and let's talk a little bit\nabout, well, the LED for a bit, all right?\n\n244\n00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.777\nNow the LED is pretty much\nthe same exact technology.\n\n245\n00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:47.356\nIn fact I'll let you guys kind of look\nat the diagram that I have here, and\n\n246\n00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:49.466\nby all means, you can always pause it, and\n\n247\n00:12:49.466 --> 00:12:52.510\nyou can kind of go through these layers,\nright?\n\n248\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.010\nNotice the one thing that changes,\nand I can make it a lot easier for\n\n249\n00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.940\nyou guys to see it.\n\n250\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.940\nIt's the bottom row, right, it's how it's\nbacklit that really changes everything.\n\n251\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.285\nLEDs, imagine,\nwhat do you think it's backlit with?\n\n252\n00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:04.640\n[LAUGH] A light emitting diode.\n\n253\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the reasons we\n\n254\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.290\ncall them LEDs.\n\n255\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n256\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:13.258\nBut they get super bright, and they're\na whole lot easier to work with, right.\n\n257\n00:13:13.258 --> 00:13:17.493\nThey also take up less energy, so\nyou'll notice that LED LCDs are typically\n\n258\n00:13:17.493 --> 00:13:21.010\nthinner, they're lighter, and\nare more energy efficient.\n\n259\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.580\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely couldn't have said it\nbetter myself that's exactly what it is.\n\n260\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.830\nIt comes down to a smaller form factor\nthe fact that you look at the side of\n\n261\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.550\nthe monitor because its so thin-\n&gt;&gt; It's like half an inch\n\n262\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, so\n\n263\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.554\nthat is something to keep in mind is\nthat lower power requirements, right,\n\n264\n00:13:35.554 --> 00:13:37.538\nthinner form factor designs.\n\n265\n00:13:37.538 --> 00:13:40.204\nThe other thing I want you\nto keep in mind and again,\n\n266\n00:13:40.204 --> 00:13:44.065\nI don't know how in depth they're\ngonna get with monitor technologies.\n\n267\n00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:46.625\nBut let me kinda tell you\nthat even within LEDs,\n\n268\n00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.960\nthey have a couple of different\nback lighting technologies.\n\n269\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.197\nIt's still LED, right, but what they have\nis known as basically white LED back\n\n270\n00:13:55.197 --> 00:14:00.570\nlighting and they have what's known\nas RGB LED backlighting, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.420\nWhite backlighting is kind of a,\nit's an interesting how it happens, right?\n\n272\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.090\nIt's actually a trick of the mind,\n\n273\n00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.593\nand what I mean by that is\nwhite backlighting isn't white.\n\n274\n00:14:10.593 --> 00:14:12.580\n[LAUGH] It's actually blue and\n\n275\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.530\nthere's yellow phosphorous colors in\nthere and the mixing of the two kind\n\n276\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.100\nof fools your eye into believing\nwhat you see is actually white.\n\n277\n00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.450\nDon't worry about that for the exam-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.810\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a heads up there.\n\n279\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.160\nNow the other technology is exactly what\nit sounds like right, red, green, blue.\n\n280\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.780\nAll right, for every color you have three\nlittle LEDs red, green and blue, right,\n\n281\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.560\nand it forms what's known\nas an LED matrix, right?\n\n282\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.745\nThink of the matrix, right,\nif you go back to the movie and\n\n283\n00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:41.979\nyou see the little binary codes coming\ndown and they cover the entire screen.\n\n284\n00:14:41.979 --> 00:14:43.760\nThat's essentially what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n285\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.660\nSo do keep that in mind,\n\n286\n00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.850\nthat that is some of the technologies\nwhen it comes to LCD and LED.\n\n287\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.720\nBut we're not out of the woods yet\nunfortunately.\n\n288\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.294\nRight?\nWe also have other technologies like OLED.\n\n289\n00:14:55.475 --> 00:15:00.458\nNow with OLED it is a little bit different\nin the fact that the backlighting source\n\n290\n00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:02.591\nis an organic substance, right.\n\n291\n00:15:02.591 --> 00:15:05.442\nIt's an organic substance you can\nput electrical current to and\n\n292\n00:15:05.442 --> 00:15:06.935\nit produces a phosphorous glow.\n\n293\n00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:09.853\nIn fact, the military kind of\nhad this around for a long time.\n\n294\n00:15:09.853 --> 00:15:13.479\nAnd I think I was doing some little\nresearch on it, right, and it goes back\n\n295\n00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:17.460\nto the late 50s and very early on in\nthe technology, not what we see today.\n\n296\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.140\nBut they could take like citric acid and\nthey could apply an electrode to it or\n\n297\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.820\nan electrical current and it will glow.\n\n298\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.570\nLike I know we used to see this out there\nwhen I go fishing at night in certain\n\n299\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.220\nareas and you've probably seen\nwhere we see the fish like well,\n\n300\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.770\nI can see the green fish there.\n\n301\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.613\nAnd again that's because of the high\nphosphorous content in the water so\n\n302\n00:15:35.613 --> 00:15:37.190\nthe concept is the same.\n\n303\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.360\nI wanna kinda go along with what\nDan said with LEDs being low power.\n\n304\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.610\nOLEDs are even lower than that.\n\n305\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.616\nThat's why you find the majority of those\ntypes of screens are really inside of\n\n306\n00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:50.814\nthings like your mobile devices, right.\n\n307\n00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:54.144\nBecause think about mobility right,\nwhen it comes to mobility,\n\n308\n00:15:54.144 --> 00:15:57.774\nthere are two major things that we\nneed to keep in mind, battery life and\n\n309\n00:15:57.774 --> 00:16:02.329\nthermal dynamics, right, making sure that\nwe don't overheat, keeping things cool.\n\n310\n00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:07.226\nOLED screens can be very,\nvery small form factor, can have a really,\n\n311\n00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:12.040\nreally small real estate, if you will,\nas far as the dimensions go,\n\n312\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.700\nand produce an excellent\nquality type of output.\n\n313\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.480\nSo those are some that you have, too.\n\n314\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.990\nNow the other ones that they also talk\nabout, they talk about two types.\n\n315\n00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.815\nThey talk about a plasma screen.\n\n316\n00:16:23.815 --> 00:16:28.841\nPlasma screens, they are out there,\nthey still sell them for sure.\n\n317\n00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:31.670\nBut there are some drawbacks\nto a plasma screen.\n\n318\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.220\nOne, power.\n\n319\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.938\nThey are very,\nvery power hungry next to an LED screen.\n\n320\n00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:42.758\nBut they also have a very\nwide viewing angle.\n\n321\n00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:46.074\nThey don't have quite the reflections\nlike an LCD screen would, so\n\n322\n00:16:46.074 --> 00:16:48.010\nthere all benefits to them.\n\n323\n00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.966\nThe other one is what is\nknown as a projector.\n\n324\n00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:53.594\nAnd a projector is the one that uses\nlenses, if you will, usually red,\n\n325\n00:16:53.594 --> 00:16:54.800\ngreen and blue.\n\n326\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.660\nAnd it projects against some\nkind of back drop, right.\n\n327\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.450\nThat's really pretty much, I would say,\nfor the exam all you have to know\n\n328\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.550\nwhen it comes to a projector,\nknowing that type.\n\n329\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.880\nAll right, moving down on our list,\n\n330\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.665\nwe gotta talk about what's\nknown as refresh rate.\n\n331\n00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:13.100\nAnd we have to know\nwhat's called frame rate.\n\n332\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.601\nAnd, yes, they are different.\n\n333\n00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:18.553\nWhen we talk about refresh rate, it's\nkinda interesting that the light sources\n\n334\n00:17:18.553 --> 00:17:22.360\nthat we see when we use artificial\nlighting isn't a static light source.\n\n335\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.375\nThey're actually turning on and\noff very, very fast.\n\n336\n00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:31.352\nAnd refresh rate, if you will,\nis how fast does the screen get repainted,\n\n337\n00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:33.580\nbasically turning on and off?\n\n338\n00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.631\nRefresh rate is measured in hertz.\n\n339\n00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:39.701\nAnd one of the things you'll have to keep\nin mind is that typically 60 hertz and\n\n340\n00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:41.725\nabove, really, is what you'll see.\n\n341\n00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:43.160\nAnd why is that?\n\n342\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.717\nWell, a lot of times you can't\neven adjust refresh rates anymore.\n\n343\n00:17:46.717 --> 00:17:50.233\nOne of the great things, or one of\nthe things to keep in mind about refresh\n\n344\n00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:53.866\nrates, is that anything lower than\n60 hertz, the optical nerves within\n\n345\n00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:57.860\nyour eyes actually pick up on the fact\nthat there's a flickering image.\n\n346\n00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.287\nAnd it can give you headaches, right.\n\n347\n00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.172\nWe don't really modify these too much,\nDan.\n\n348\n00:18:01.172 --> 00:18:04.879\nI don't know if you remember the old CRTs,\nyou definitely had to, because if you were\n\n349\n00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:08.115\nstaring at it too long, it could lead\nto things like headaches and stuff.\n\n350\n00:18:08.115 --> 00:18:09.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n351\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that is, and\n\n352\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.800\nframe rates, right,\nwe didn't talk about frame rate right.\n\n353\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.590\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned it [LAUGH].\n\n354\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.530\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned it [LAUGH],\nthat's right, I went there.\n\n355\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.670\nSo refresh rate is\na characteristic of the screen.\n\n356\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.820\nFrame rate is a characteristic\nof how fast the video's moving.\n\n357\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.268\nSo there's two different,\nthey're close, right.\n\n358\n00:18:26.268 --> 00:18:31.730\nFrame rate is how fast you can get\nindividual pictures into the monitor.\n\n359\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.970\nWhere refresh rate is a characteristic\nof the monitor, itself.\n\n360\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.690\nAnd it could have an adverse effect\non refresh rate, if that makes sense.\n\n361\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:44.210\nSo do please keep that in mind.\n\n362\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.240\nWhat else do we have?\n\n363\n00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.900\nWe gotta talk about\nthings like resolution.\n\n364\n00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.130\n&gt;&gt; That could be important.\n\n365\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.387\n&gt;&gt; Resolution is important, right [LAUGH].\n\n366\n00:18:50.387 --> 00:18:55.512\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Resolution comes down to, basically,\n\n367\n00:18:55.512 --> 00:19:01.270\nhow many pixels does the surface\narea of the screen make up?\n\n368\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.460\nIn fact, I've got kind of a diagram here.\n\n369\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.866\nYou can kind of think of it this way,\nright.\n\n370\n00:19:05.866 --> 00:19:09.540\nOn your monitors, you have\na horizontal axis, if you will, and\n\n371\n00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.798\nthen you have a vertical axis, right.\n\n372\n00:19:11.798 --> 00:19:16.814\nWhen you look at something like 920\nby 1080, it literally means you can\n\n373\n00:19:16.814 --> 00:19:22.840\nfit 1,920 pixels in a single row, and\n1,080, if you will, in the vertical.\n\n374\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.490\nSo please keep that in mind,\n\n375\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.450\nthat resolution is the overall amount\nof pixels that the monitor supports.\n\n376\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.280\nNow, one thing also to keep in\nmind when we talk about LCDs and\n\n377\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.597\nLEDs, unlike the earlier CRT monitors,\n\n378\n00:19:37.597 --> 00:19:42.831\nI do want you to keep in mind that\nyou could adjust the resolution.\n\n379\n00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:45.785\nAll right, so you could potentially,\non the old CRT monitors,\n\n380\n00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:49.165\nyou can get a better resolution\nbecause you could change it.\n\n381\n00:19:49.165 --> 00:19:50.845\nLCD and LEDs don't do that.\n\n382\n00:19:50.845 --> 00:19:52.945\nThey have what's known\nas a fixed resolution.\n\n383\n00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:56.345\nOn the exam, the objectives\ncall that a native resolution.\n\n384\n00:19:56.345 --> 00:20:01.325\nNative resolution is the one resolution\nthat that monitor was made to support.\n\n385\n00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:06.123\nNow, understand, I'm not saying that\nyou can't change the resolution.\n\n386\n00:20:06.123 --> 00:20:07.601\nBut in changing the resolution,\n\n387\n00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:11.208\na lot of times what you see is you just\nkind of make icons bigger, like pixelated.\n\n388\n00:20:11.208 --> 00:20:15.090\nIt never improves the quality\nof the image, itself.\n\n389\n00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.100\nSo that is important.\n\n390\n00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.210\nAll right, now we get to two really,\nreally confusing terms.\n\n391\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.110\nOne is subjective, objective,\nI guess would be the opposite of that.\n\n392\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.781\n&gt;&gt; Yes, objective is the opposite\nof subjective [LAUGH].\n\n393\n00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:31.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, so they talk about\nbrightness in lumens, all right.\n\n394\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.934\nBrightness is kind of,\nhere we go with those number games, right,\n\n395\n00:20:34.934 --> 00:20:36.360\nthat's very bright.\n\n396\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.730\nWhat does that mean, right?\n\n397\n00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.460\nWell, that's perception, okay.\n\n398\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.610\nBrightness, if you will,\n\n399\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.180\nis a subjective term that describes\nhow bright the display is.\n\n400\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.030\nThe problem with it is\nbrightness isn't measurable.\n\n401\n00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.370\nThere's no measurable unit that says\nI can measure the brightness, right.\n\n402\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.199\nI can say right now, to Dan and I, we've\nbeen standing in these studios for, Dan,\n\n403\n00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:57.850\nyou've been doing it for\ntwo, three years now, right.\n\n404\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.070\nAnd to us, yeah, it's bright,\nbut it's not that bad.\n\n405\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.320\nHowever, we've had some people\nthat come in and go, wow,\n\n406\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.690\nthat's got a blinding bright.\n\n407\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.252\nIt's bright.\n\n408\n00:21:04.252 --> 00:21:07.160\nIt's a subjective term,\nwe can't really measure it.\n\n409\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.735\nThat's where the other part of\nthe measurable term comes in, and\n\n410\n00:21:10.735 --> 00:21:12.367\nthat's lumens, all right.\n\n411\n00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:16.289\nSo lumens is basically,\nif you will, is luminance.\n\n412\n00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:19.623\nAnd it is the intensity\nof the light that's\n\n413\n00:21:19.623 --> 00:21:23.148\nemitted on a surface per a unit area,\nright.\n\n414\n00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:25.845\nWe can actually get\na measurement in lumens.\n\n415\n00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:29.590\nLuminance, again,\ncan be measured, or luminance,\n\n416\n00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.990\nif you will, can be measured in lumens.\n\n417\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.130\nWhen we say increase the lumens,\nagain, you increase the brightness.\n\n418\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.150\nAgain, just remember brightness, again,\nis just a subjective term, the amount of\n\n419\n00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:49.050\nlight output or the intensity of a light\nthat's produced by the display, itself.\n\n420\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.190\nAll right, Dan, moving down this list,\n\n421\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.260\nlet's see a couple of things\nthat we also have to talk about.\n\n422\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.760\nWe have to talk about privacy and\nanti-glare filters.\n\n423\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.493\nWhat are we talking about here?\n\n424\n00:21:59.493 --> 00:22:03.230\nWe didn't say anything about\nthe intrusion prevention system, right.\n\n425\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.850\nBut this is kind of like an intrusion,\nright, an intrusion prevention system,\n\n426\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:07.444\nif you will.\n\n427\n00:22:07.444 --> 00:22:08.869\nAnti-glare filters, yes,\n\n428\n00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:12.517\nthey do restrict the glare that you'll\nsee sitting in front of the monitor.\n\n429\n00:22:12.517 --> 00:22:17.192\nBut they are also called privacy filters\nbecause one of the things that it does is,\n\n430\n00:22:17.192 --> 00:22:21.596\nas you move out of the direct front and\ncenter location of the monitor itself,\n\n431\n00:22:21.596 --> 00:22:24.545\nyou'll end up seeing that it darkens out,\nright.\n\n432\n00:22:24.545 --> 00:22:26.882\nSo it keeps people [LAUGH],\nit doesn't keep people, right.\n\n433\n00:22:26.882 --> 00:22:30.711\nIt helps to reduce the risk of people\ndoing things like shoulder surfing,\n\n434\n00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:33.306\nseeing exactly what's\ngoing on on your monitor,\n\n435\n00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:36.410\nrealizing that you're watching YouTube and\nnot working.\n\n436\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.950\n&gt;&gt; I knew I hated that thing [LAUGH].\n\n437\n00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.690\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nwe'll get one for\n\n438\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.060\nDan at the end of the day so\nhe'll be safe.\n\n439\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.560\nAnd the other thing they also\nmention is multiple displays.\n\n440\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.197\nThis is not, this isn't, if you will,\na characteristic of the monitor.\n\n441\n00:22:49.197 --> 00:22:50.876\nI know they put in in display devices,\nDan.\n\n442\n00:22:50.876 --> 00:22:53.705\nBut, again,\nif I said I needed a multi-monitor output,\n\n443\n00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:57.230\nwhat do you think would be the\ncontributing factor to whether my computer\n\n444\n00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.940\nsupports multi-monitor or not?\n\n445\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.370\n&gt;&gt; The contributing factor,\nit has multiple display ports?\n\n446\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.470\n&gt;&gt; That's one of them,\nthat's the graphics card, right.\n\n447\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.180\nSo it's the graphics card that actually\n\n448\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.660\ntells you whether you can\nsupport multiple monitors.\n\n449\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.070\nNow, most graphics cards do today,\nyou can even get hubs that allow.\n\n450\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.160\nWe actually use hubs here that split.\n\n451\n00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.109\nUnderstand that even though they put\nthis in the display devices, personally,\n\n452\n00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:22.900\nI believe it rally should be in the\nexpansion cards that we've talked about.\n\n453\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.980\n&gt;&gt; So does the graphics card, cuz I've\nalso seen and worked with the Y-splitters.\n\n454\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.216\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That you put into one input.\n\n455\n00:23:29.216 --> 00:23:32.157\nSo if you have a graphics card that's\nonly got one output, you put that on.\n\n456\n00:23:32.157 --> 00:23:33.563\nIt's got a splitter,\nnow you have two monitors.\n\n457\n00:23:33.563 --> 00:23:35.960\nDoes that dictate whether or\nnot that works as well or?\n\n458\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.723\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n459\n00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:37.487\n&gt;&gt; It does?\n\n460\n00:23:37.487 --> 00:23:40.001\n&gt;&gt; It's really characteristic\nof the graphics card.\n\n461\n00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:42.753\nIf it's an integrated graphics card, then\nit's a characteristic of the motherboard.\n\n462\n00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:44.077\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's the chip set that will\n\n463\n00:23:44.077 --> 00:23:46.260\ncontrol the graphics in general so, yeah.\n\n464\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.898\nBut what it isn't a characteristic\nof is the monitor, right.\n\n465\n00:23:49.898 --> 00:23:51.930\nIf I have two 27 inch\nmonitors side by side,\n\n466\n00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.912\nthey don't know each other exist, right.\n\n467\n00:23:53.912 --> 00:23:59.045\nIt's the graphics system,\nif you will, that's spreading that\n\n468\n00:23:59.045 --> 00:24:04.847\ninformation coming out of the computer\nAcross those multiple monitors.\n\n469\n00:24:04.847 --> 00:24:09.515\nAlright, now the last thing that we have\nto talk about in this episode is what is\n\n470\n00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:11.470\nknown as aspect ratio.\n\n471\n00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.220\nAll right.\nNow aspect ratio is just a proportional\n\n472\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.272\nrelationship between an image width and\nits height.\n\n473\n00:24:19.272 --> 00:24:23.910\nAll right, and there are a few different\nones that we do wanna talk about.\n\n474\n00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:28.669\nAll right, one of the things we want\nto talk about is the different aspect\n\n475\n00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:32.882\nratios for a long time now, and\nI know you are into photography so\n\n476\n00:24:32.882 --> 00:24:37.875\nthis one will get you a long time\nprinted images, photography was in a 4.3\n\n477\n00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:43.040\naspect ratio that was actually\na standard for a long time really.\n\n478\n00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.860\nAnd it's what our old CRT monitors\nsupports, and let's go ahead and\n\n479\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.650\nlook at little diagram so\nyou guys can kind of get.\n\n480\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.250\nWhen I say that proportional relationship,\nnotice height,\n\n481\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.100\na ratio to its width to its height.\n\n482\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.160\nI said height, width,\nunderstand it's width to height.\n\n483\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.180\nAnd you can see the difference\nbetween some of these different types,\n\n484\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.856\nif you will, of aspect ratios.\n\n485\n00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:10.270\nThere is 4.3, it was common for\na very, very long time.\n\n486\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.890\nNow, you'll see in your objectives,\n\n487\n00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.580\nI'm gonna do this a little out of order\njust because of the history behind it.\n\n488\n00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.820\n16 by 10 was popular for a little bit.\n\n489\n00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.970\nAnd one of the reasons the 16 by\n10 was common is that TVs were,\n\n490\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.720\nor I'm sorry,\n16 by 10 was popular in monitors but\n\n491\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.760\nit wasn't popular in TVs\nis what I meant to say.\n\n492\n00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.680\nIt fell out of favor and one of the\nreasons it fell out of favor is because\n\n493\n00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.200\nif you think about people like Samsung,\nif you think about people like LG,\n\n494\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.280\nand I'm just thinking of some of\nthe monitor manufacturers out there.\n\n495\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.215\nSamsung makes TVs, and\nthey make monitors, right?\n\n496\n00:25:47.215 --> 00:25:49.797\nWell, it got really inconvenient for\n\n497\n00:25:49.797 --> 00:25:54.406\nthe manufacturers to make a 16 x\n10 monitor versus a 16 x 9 TV.\n\n498\n00:25:54.406 --> 00:25:58.498\nSo 16:10 kind of fell out of favor and\nit's really been replaced today and\n\n499\n00:25:58.498 --> 00:26:01.668\nI say replaced but\nit's really more common to see 16 by 9.\n\n500\n00:26:01.668 --> 00:26:06.394\nAs 16 by 9, I want you to understand\nallows the manufacturers to put\n\n501\n00:26:06.394 --> 00:26:10.414\nthe same technologies they have in TVs and\nmonitors right.\n\n502\n00:26:10.414 --> 00:26:15.319\nI've actually hooked up my computer\nwith an external adaptor right\n\n503\n00:26:15.319 --> 00:26:20.233\nto a 55 inch TV and let me tell you,\nthat's a big monitor for sure.\n\n504\n00:26:20.233 --> 00:26:23.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So 16 by 9 is the common,\n\n505\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.040\nit's the international standard\nright now for high definition TV.\n\n506\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:34.760\nAnd it really is what has pretty\nmuch replaced all four by three.\n\n507\n00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.520\nDon't get me wrong you can still see\n16 by 10 and where do you still see it?\n\n508\n00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.300\nTablets, tablets are still 16 by 10, but\nagain different monitor types you see it\n\n509\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:48.350\non 16 by 10 OLED tablet screen\nversus the more common, 16 by 9.\n\n510\n00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:53.340\nNow, there are all different kinds of\nresolutions out there that they support,\n\n511\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.250\nI'm just going to mention\nthem here briefly.\n\n512\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.540\nIn 16 x 10,\nsome of the common ones you have.\n\n513\n00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.020\nIt's what's known as WXGA,\nthat's wide extended graphics array and\n\n514\n00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.370\nthat is a 1280 x 800.\n\n515\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.951\nThere's more,\njust kind of give you examples here.\n\n516\n00:27:06.951 --> 00:27:10.707\nIt's also wide ultra extended\nGraphics are right here.\n\n517\n00:27:10.707 --> 00:27:14.727\nThey're just gonna put alphabet\nin some of the whole alphabet and\n\n518\n00:27:14.727 --> 00:27:16.931\nthat is your 1920 by 1200.\n\n519\n00:27:16.931 --> 00:27:21.621\nMaybe you seen that or\nheard about that.16 by 9 we have anything\n\n520\n00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:27.260\nfrom 1280 by 720, all the way up to and\nthis is interesting.\n\n521\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:33.033\nUltra 4K, when you talk about ultra\n44K we're talking 4096 by 2304,\n\n522\n00:27:33.033 --> 00:27:38.807\nand they even have things,and you don't\nhave to worry about this one on the exam,\n\n523\n00:27:38.807 --> 00:27:42.068\nbut I definitely want one\nof these in my house,\n\n524\n00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:45.612\n80 192 by 4608, and that is full 8k TV.\n\n525\n00:27:45.612 --> 00:27:47.539\n&gt;&gt; That's the numbers you multiply\ntogether to get the price of\n\n526\n00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:48.112\nthe television.\n\n527\n00:27:48.112 --> 00:27:49.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n528\n00:27:49.774 --> 00:27:50.840\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right, or\n\n529\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.484\nthe years that it takes to pay it off,\nfor sure.\n\n530\n00:27:52.484 --> 00:27:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n531\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:58.410\n&gt;&gt; So guys I know we threw a lot\nof specifications at you, but\n\n532\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.300\nkeep in mind, if you are aware\nof some of these specifications,\n\n533\n00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.640\nyou should do good when it\ncomes to passing the exam.\n\n534\n00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.720\nNow, there's one last thing that I\nkinda wanna talk about when it comes\n\n535\n00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.950\nto just video in general.\n\n536\n00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.930\nIn the past, with our earlier CRT\nmonitors, and this is really talking about\n\n537\n00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.210\nthe communication ports that we use,\nas well as the technology.\n\n538\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.260\nIt's analog, video and digital video.\n\n539\n00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:27.240\nWhen we talk about analog video,\nit's really kind of outdated today.\n\n540\n00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.540\nIt's still there, we've talked about it in\nother episodes like video graphics array.\n\n541\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.775\nBut more common today that you see is\nat a minimum DVI, digital connections.\n\n542\n00:28:37.775 --> 00:28:40.875\nWe talked about this in some\nof our PC connection episodes.\n\n543\n00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:43.095\nThings like HDMI, very very prevalent.\n\n544\n00:28:43.095 --> 00:28:46.455\nAs well as display port and\neven now we've had for a while.\n\n545\n00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:51.920\nI say now Thunderbolt technology, so\nunderstand the difference between the old\n\n546\n00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.750\nanalog like a sine wave if you will\nversus a series of ones and zeros.\n\n547\n00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.980\nAnd again,\nthe difference between analog and digital.\n\n548\n00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.950\nSo just a few of the display technologies\nthat you have to keep in mind and\n\n549\n00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.650\nif you can get some of\nthese under your belt,\n\n550\n00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.050\nyou're going to be doing good when they\nask you these questions on your exam.\n\n551\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.250\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, thanks so much for\n\n552\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.000\nexplaining the different types of\ndisplays that we might be working with.\n\n553\n00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.500\nAnd their characteristics cuz we're gonna\nneed that like you say for that exam.\n\n554\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.200\nThat being said, looking at our clock.\n\n555\n00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.500\nWow the time,\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n556\n00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.900\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n557\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n558\n00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.823\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n559\n00:29:29.112 --> 00:29:35.013\n[MUSIC]\n\n560\n00:29:35.013 --> 00:29:37.651\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:08.287\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:12.041\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.005\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.273\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:18.898\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:20.640\nwe are back with more in our A+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.090\nThat's right, the good old, was it 220901?\n\n11\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.110\nThat's it.\nThere it is.\n\n12\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.650\nThere's the nomenclature for you.\n\n13\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.030\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\n\n14\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.440\nagain to lend his expertise on that\nknowledge, our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.470\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n16\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Hey, man, how's it going?\n\n17\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.565\nGotta give you props man, all the\ndifferent episodes you host around here.\n\n18\n00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:40.697\nYou happen to keep some of those\nnumbers rattling around in your brain.\n\n19\n00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:42.705\n[LAUGH] And you give me credit for\nacronyms, there.\n\n20\n00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.405\n&gt;&gt; And they pass me around\nto every different show.\n\n21\n00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:45.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n22\n00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:46.755\nSo props to you there, bud.\n\n23\n00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.825\nAbsolutely, I'm doing great and\ngreat to be here as always in the 220901,\n\n24\n00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.540\nthe one that Dan mentioned there.\n\n25\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.231\nWe're going to be looking at the some of\nthe peripherals that we can expand on our\n\n26\n00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:58.849\nuser experience, right?\n\n27\n00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:02.518\nIn past episodes we've talked about\nthe system unit and the motherboard and\n\n28\n00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:05.784\nexpanding the functionality of\nthe computer itself, if you will,\n\n29\n00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:07.580\nby adding expansion cards, right?\n\n30\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.100\nWell, we can also expand our computing\nexperience by making connections,\n\n31\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.690\nexternal connections back\nto the system unit and\n\n32\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.010\nadding functionality that isn't\nnormally built into the computer.\n\n33\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.440\nAnd some of these are actually\nbuilt in by today's standards.\n\n34\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.740\nSo let's go ahead and\nwere gonna go through\n\n35\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.770\nreally just a series of the different\ntypes of peripherals, right, these\n\n36\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.790\nexternal devices that make connections\nthrough a port on your machine.\n\n37\n00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.790\nSome of the first ones they call out,\nand in fact, let me go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.010\nkinda change gears here for\na second before we just dive right\n\n39\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.930\ninto talking about a whole bunch of\ndifferent type of peripherals, all right?\n\n40\n00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.520\nOne of the things I want you to\nunderstand for the exams, or\n\n41\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240\nmore of the specifics is what\nthe device is performing.\n\n42\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.825\nAnd what I mean by that,\nwhat functionalities is it performing.\n\n43\n00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:54.740\nAnd more specifically,\nis this an audio input type device, right?\n\n44\n00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.287\nIs this an audio output device?\n\n45\n00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:01.085\nIs this a video input or output device?\n\n46\n00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:04.535\nDoes this perform data\ninput versus data output?\n\n47\n00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.803\nSo also know the direction of\nthe communication as well,\n\n48\n00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:10.880\nrather than just knowing\nthe device itself, right?\n\n49\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.010\nSo for instance if they ask you, what does\na printer do, right, versus a keyboard?\n\n50\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.318\nIf you think about it,\na keyboard is a data input device, right?\n\n51\n00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:23.900\nIt's how we interact with the computing\nsystem by sending, typing in commands.\n\n52\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.352\nAnd that inputs the data that controls\nthe computer essentially, right,\n\n53\n00:02:27.352 --> 00:02:28.760\nversus a printer.\n\n54\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.231\nA printer is a text or\nimage based output device, right?\n\n55\n00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:37.726\nIt's how we get data out of the machine\nin some kind of printed media, right?\n\n56\n00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:40.666\nSo definitely pay attention to\nthat through the various devices\n\n57\n00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:42.090\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n58\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.150\nAnd I'll also continue to mention them,\n\n59\n00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.570\nif you will, as what kind of\nfunctionality the device is doing.\n\n60\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.190\nAll right, well,\n\n61\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.780\nthat lends us to the very first thing and\nthat is what is known as a mouse, right.\n\n62\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.320\nMouse, when we talk about mice,\nI guess if you will say,\n\n63\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.680\nthey've been in a computing\nenvironment for a very long time.\n\n64\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.470\nIn fact, I wanna say this goes back\nto the 50s where some of the people,\n\n65\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.970\nI wanna say, it was like DEC,\nDigital Equipment Corporation.\n\n66\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.720\nI might have that wrong, but\nthe original inventor of a mouse,\n\n67\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.740\nbasically, it was a wooden box with a\ncouple of metal gears in it, if you will.\n\n68\n00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.260\nAnd it used plotter vector coordinates,\nright, to position a cursor,\n\n69\n00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.710\nif you will, on the screen, right?\n\n70\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.331\nThe cursor is the little logical\npointing device that we see,\n\n71\n00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.615\nwhere the mouse itself is\nthe physical device, right?\n\n72\n00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:31.690\nAnd there are a few different\nkinds over the years.\n\n73\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.770\nOne that's kind of gone by\nthe wayside there is the mechanical\n\n74\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.000\nmouse, if you will.\n\n75\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.550\nAnd this is the one that would use\nlike a little rubber ball-bearing\n\n76\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.630\nin the bottom of it to manipulate\nsome rotating gears inside of it and\n\n77\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.810\nit would move up and down, left and right.\n\n78\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.700\nAnd this is the one where you can actually\nunscrew the bottom of the mouse itself,\n\n79\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.545\npull off a cover, pull the bearing out.\n\n80\n00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:52.550\nAnd you'd have to get it in there and\n\n81\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.665\nyou'd have to clean those little\nactuator motors with like a Q-tip and\n\n82\n00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:58.875\nmaybe a little bit of alcohol cuz\nthey collect dust, if you will.\n\n83\n00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:02.455\nThank goodness, we really don't use too\nmany of them because when it comes to\n\n84\n00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:06.635\npositioning of the cursor,\nthey were good for the time, but\n\n85\n00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:11.085\nwe have more accurate ways of essentially\ninteracting with our computer,\n\n86\n00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.910\nespecially when it comes to the cursor\nthat you see on the screen.\n\n87\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.700\nThat being said, we're talking about,\nfor instance, optical mouse.\n\n88\n00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.380\nAn optical mouse is one that\nuses an optical light source in\n\n89\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.770\norder to track position.\n\n90\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.560\nIn fact, we've kinda got one here.\n\n91\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.930\nAnd this is just a very basic mouse here.\n\n92\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.570\nThere's nothing fancy about it.\n\n93\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.240\nI know some gamers would say no I\nwouldn't be caught dead with that type\n\n94\n00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.760\nof thing, right?\n\n95\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.450\nBecause you can get very,\nvery expensive mice here.\n\n96\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.810\nBut if you look, you can see that\nthere is an optical laser source.\n\n97\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.497\nAnd I don't know if this\nis gonna work on my Mac.\n\n98\n00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:42.710\nProbably should have tested\nthis before we started here.\n\n99\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.740\nBut we'll give it a whirl and\nsee if it powers up here.\n\n100\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.350\nYeah, there we go.\n\n101\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.935\n&gt;&gt; It blinded us all.\n\n102\n00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.815\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, you know what they say.\n\n103\n00:04:47.815 --> 00:04:48.848\n&gt;&gt; There's a warning right there.\n\n104\n00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:50.576\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nyou should always look in the laser, no.\n\n105\n00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:52.934\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We were just kidding, right?\n\n106\n00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:54.809\nBut that's what's essentially happening,\nright?\n\n107\n00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.014\nThe mouse itself is actually\nmanipulating the cursor here and\n\n108\n00:04:58.014 --> 00:04:59.620\nit's tracking the position.\n\n109\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.205\nAnd what's kinda cool is as I'm doing this\nI can see my cursor over there on the Mac\n\n110\n00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:04.695\nkinda going crazy on me, right?\n\n111\n00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:09.363\nBut then you typically have the little\ncenter wheel there, and the roller wheel,\n\n112\n00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:12.555\nif you will,\ncontrols things like page up, page down.\n\n113\n00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:14.859\nIt's a scrolling wheel, if you will, and\n\n114\n00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:18.855\nyou typically have some kind of\nleft-click and you have a right-click.\n\n115\n00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:23.943\nAnd depending on what you're doing\non your computer and how you have\n\n116\n00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:29.754\nthe logical side of this configured\nwill dictate which one these buttons do.\n\n117\n00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:35.150\nThe basic configuration we say, what is\nit, left for select, right for effect.\n\n118\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.020\nAnd that means basically right-click\ngives you a series of options,\n\n119\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.940\na left-click typically selects\nwhatever the object is.\n\n120\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.320\nAnd then you can move the mouse around.\n\n121\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.570\nAnd again, remember,\nthe optical light source.\n\n122\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.960\nYou can kind of see it kind of light\nup there, will control the position\n\n123\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.550\nof the cursor on the screen\nrelative to how you're moving it.\n\n124\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.360\nThere are other types as well.\n\n125\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.720\nThere's a couple of different optical\nlight sources that they have today.\n\n126\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.174\nThey have what is known\nas a blue track mouse.\n\n127\n00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:05.330\nAnd I believe it was Microsoft\nthat first invented this.\n\n128\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.918\nAnd all that's using is\na blue optical source.\n\n129\n00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:12.100\nAnd the thought process behind this is\nthe fact that you have to be careful with\n\n130\n00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.250\nan optical mouse because if\nit's on a reflective surface,\n\n131\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.240\nit can mess with the calculations,\nright, the tracking of the system.\n\n132\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.991\nAgain, kind of like a mirror\nreflecting the optical light source.\n\n133\n00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:24.747\nIt might be reflecting it right\nback into the lens itself, and\n\n134\n00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:26.871\nit can cause all kinds\nof squirrelly problems.\n\n135\n00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:30.620\nThat's why we say that's the reason\nyou have a mouse pad, right?\n\n136\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.230\nThe mouse pad some people think, well, the\nmouse pad is just made for the old roller\n\n137\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.180\nball mice because it would give a grip\non it, give you a little more traction.\n\n138\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.020\nThat really isn't the case.\n\n139\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.130\nKeep in mind that it's more for,\ntoday, for the reflective surface.\n\n140\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.149\nNow I don't see this in the list.\n\n141\n00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:53.537\nI do wanna mention another type\nof mouse based type device.\n\n142\n00:06:53.537 --> 00:06:55.090\nIt's called a track ball.\n\n143\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.380\nAnd a track ball essentially is\nthe old mechanical roller ball mouse\n\n144\n00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.810\nturned upside down.\n\n145\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.000\nMe personally, I can't stand them.\n\n146\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.080\nAnd one of the great things about\nthem is you can leave the mouse,\n\n147\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.100\nthe base if you will,\nin a single location and\n\n148\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.250\nyou just use the roller ball that's on top\nof it to move the cursor back and forth.\n\n149\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.370\nSome people swear by them.\n\n150\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.560\nI know one of hosts,\nDon, loves track balls.\n\n151\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.210\nOur owner and CEO, well,\nboth our co-founder and\n\n152\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.520\nfounder there, love the track ball.\n\n153\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.510\nPersonally, I can't stand it.\n\n154\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.930\nI've never been able to get used to them.\n\n155\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.680\nIf you ask me to work on your computer and\nyou have a track ball I'm gonna go\n\n156\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.550\nfind a mouse and plug it into your\ncomputer so that I can work with it.\n\n157\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.190\nHowever, they got a low latency.\n\n158\n00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.830\nSo they're very, very fast devices and\nthey have a real,\n\n159\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:43.500\nreal ultra fine precision when it comes\nto real fine point placing the cursor.\n\n160\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.940\nThat being said, a few different types\nof connections you have to keep in mind.\n\n161\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.284\nWhat you've seen here was a USB.\n\n162\n00:07:50.284 --> 00:07:54.386\nAnd when we talk about a USB mouse,\nobviously making the USB base connection,\n\n163\n00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:57.632\nalthough you also have some of\nthe earlier type connections.\n\n164\n00:07:57.632 --> 00:08:00.150\nThose are the old PS2 ports or\nthe six pin mini DIN.\n\n165\n00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.769\nAnd you can see those for\nyour keyboard, mouse, green, and blue.\n\n166\n00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:05.847\nPurple, and also wireless communications.\n\n167\n00:08:05.847 --> 00:08:09.540\nAnd keep in mind we've got two types of\nwireless communications that they can use.\n\n168\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.720\nThey could use WiFi communications,\na lot of times they use bluetooth as well,\n\n169\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.770\nand they'll go through\nthe pairing process.\n\n170\n00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.720\nSo also pay attention to\nthe connection types that you have.\n\n171\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.360\nNow, the next thing that we\nhave are keyboards, all right.\n\n172\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.310\nAnd keyboards when we look at them, they\ncome in all different shapes and sizes.\n\n173\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.340\nAnd we gotta a couple of different kinds\nhere because we really wanna talk about\n\n174\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.625\nagain the connections that you\ncould see Videos on these.\n\n175\n00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:36.345\nIn fact, I've got a wired\nkeyboard here and we have, well,\n\n176\n00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:38.395\nbasically a wireless keyboard and\n\n177\n00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:42.855\nyou can see that this one is gonna be\nusing essentially the USB connection,\n\n178\n00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:46.050\nwhere this one Well that's\ncompletely unbounded, right?\n\n179\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.060\nIt doesn't have any kind of\ntether type connection there.\n\n180\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.300\nAnd you can see when it comes down to\nit these keyboard they have different\n\n181\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.035\nbells and whistles in them.\n\n182\n00:08:56.035 --> 00:09:00.280\nOne of the common functions that they\nhave a lot of times are the function keys\n\n183\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.940\nacross the top.\n\n184\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.420\nAnd the numeric keypad, you can see\nboth of these have that function.\n\n185\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.180\nThat's actually a standard, believe it or\n\n186\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.850\nnot, that's kinda in our mindset gone by\nthe wayside because in the earlier days\n\n187\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.360\ngoing all the way back to the AT boards,\nthat numerical keypad would have been\n\n188\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.610\ndirectly connected right to the main\nkeys on the keyboard, right.\n\n189\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.590\nAnd that's one of the things that what's\nknown as the AT enhanced standard came in\n\n190\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.790\nlater on as we progressed in technology.\n\n191\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.960\nAnd that's typically where you can see\nthings like your home button here and\n\n192\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.070\npage up, page down,\nthe directional keys and\n\n193\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.460\nthen the numeric keypad\nseparate from that.\n\n194\n00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.570\nAgain, I want you to know that for\nthe exam.\n\n195\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.660\nI know that's a little bit of a, a little\ntechnical specification there, but\n\n196\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.750\nit could come up on the exam.\n\n197\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.710\nWhat is the current standard\nenhancement for a while?\n\n198\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.330\nNow there are different types\nof standards, even within that.\n\n199\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.170\nAT enhanced, and what I mean by that,\n\n200\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.260\nif we could real quick go\nback to these keyboards.\n\n201\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.652\nIt's kind of hard to see on this one cause\nthis one's positioned right here but\n\n202\n00:10:03.652 --> 00:10:08.740\nyou'll see, that is a Windows logo,\nthere is a Windows type keyboard\n\n203\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.470\nessentially is the AT enhanced board but\nwith the Windows key here.\n\n204\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:18.550\nNow Mac also follows an Apple if you well\nalso follows the AT enhanced standard too.\n\n205\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.230\nBut there's is a little\nbit different right?\n\n206\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.390\nThere's obviously isn't gonna be\na Window logo on any Mac device right?\n\n207\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.370\nIt's a common button.\n\n208\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.750\nSo keep in mind that you have\nthe command button where inside of\n\n209\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.775\na Mac you might do for instance\ncommand C for copy where you might do\n\n210\n00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:39.010\nCtrl+C on the regular\nWindows based keyboard.\n\n211\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.190\nSo a couple of different types\nof keyboards that you have.\n\n212\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.100\nAnd again remember the communications\nthat they have likewise too.\n\n213\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.880\nKeep in mind you have a wired keyboard,\n\n214\n00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.690\nthe earlier wired key boards or\nessentially the PS2 ports.\n\n215\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.400\nAnd even going back farther\nthan that's kinda interesting.\n\n216\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.310\nThey used to be called AT DIN standard\nbecause it was a five pin DIN\n\n217\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.480\nthat typically we use in\nthings like microphones and\n\n218\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.660\naudio communications that we don't\nuse in motherboards anymore.\n\n219\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.470\nMoved into the PS2 ports which\nwere six pin mini DINs and\n\n220\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.440\nthen later on because of\nthe commonality of the USB,\n\n221\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.790\nthat became the very popular\ntechnology for a very long time.\n\n222\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.650\nAnd now even today, like you see\nwith that white one that is for\n\n223\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:20.540\nthe mac based devices made by Logitech\nis essentially a wireless WiFi,\n\n224\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.765\nactually, these are Bluetooth, I believe.\n\n225\n00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:26.342\n&gt;&gt; No, this is wireless [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They are wireless, that's right,\n\n226\n00:11:26.342 --> 00:11:29.320\nbecause they use a little micro dongle,\nright?\n\n227\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.890\nA little download that\nfits into a USB port.\n\n228\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.580\nAnd again,\nyou also have Bluetooth keyboards, too.\n\n229\n00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.940\nWhich one you use is really up to you.\n\n230\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.890\nKeep in mind that one of the things\nyou always wanna remember when\n\n231\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.130\nit comes to your wireless keyboards\nthat they have batteries.\n\n232\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.110\nWe are actually kind of beneficial here.\n\n233\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.800\nIf we can go back to the keyboard here,\nI gotta kind of show this off.\n\n234\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.670\nIt's a really cool design.\n\n235\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.390\nThis actually uses solar power.\n\n236\n00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.630\nYou can see that if I kind of do that,\n\n237\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.350\nthese are actually solar panels right here\nand if I turn this keyboard on and off.\n\n238\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.660\nYou can see a little\ngreen light right there.\n\n239\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.540\nAnd that lets me know,\nthere's a little happy face right there.\n\n240\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.640\nIt lets me know it's happy,\nit's got plenty of juice.\n\n241\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.780\nAnd if it little frowny face,\nit would let me know hey,\n\n242\n00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.902\nI gotta keep this under the light.\n\n243\n00:12:07.902 --> 00:12:12.130\nBut the one great thing about that board\nthere or keyboard there is the fact that\n\n244\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.780\nit takes really,\nreally little power to charge this thing.\n\n245\n00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.550\nIn fact, I don't know that I've ever and\nwe all here,\n\n246\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.900\nthe hosts pretty much use them unless\nthe people are on Windows machines or\n\n247\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.410\nusing some other type of keyboard.\n\n248\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.060\nI don't think we've ever had one\nof these keyboards where we,\n\n249\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.770\nDan have you come in and\nsaid hey I gotta charge it?\n\n250\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.580\n&gt;&gt; No it keeps its charge pretty well.\n\n251\n00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.155\nThere's an abundance of solar radiation.\n\n252\n00:12:33.155 --> 00:12:33.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n253\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.450\nThat's right.\n\n254\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.468\nWere all cooking ourselves here.\n\n255\n00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:37.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.280\n&gt;&gt; We glow green by the end\nof the working day.\n\n257\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.370\nSo just kidding guys and gals out there.\n\n258\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.390\nBut again a couple of the different\nconnection types that you have.\n\n259\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.350\nNow we've talked in other episodes,\n\n260\n00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.680\nwe've talked about things like\nmulti functioning devices.\n\n261\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.990\nAnd when we say multi functioning devices\nwe're talking essentially a fax machine,\n\n262\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.300\nprinter, and scanner all built into one.\n\n263\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.970\nThey still have them out there today where\nwe have flatbed scanners, and again,\n\n264\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:05.560\nkeep in mind that this is a device that\nwill essentially take a photo identical\n\n265\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.330\ncopy of any kind of paper or any kind of\nmedia that you need to get a copy of.\n\n266\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.870\nUnlike a copy machine which will\ndo some kind of pixelation on it.\n\n267\n00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.650\nWe've got an example of an older one here.\n\n268\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.630\nEvery one of the hosts around here\ntypically has some kind of closet.\n\n269\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.060\nWe love IT so much that we've\ngot a lot of components here.\n\n270\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.420\nWe don't like to get rid of them.\n\n271\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.240\nSo what you can't see is this one is\nactually, and in fact, we go back to it.\n\n272\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.720\nThis one is actually\nlike the size of a barge.\n\n273\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.020\nSo this is a fairly old one but\nthe concept is the same regardless and\n\n274\n00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.010\nthey call it a flat bed scanner for\nobvious reasons.\n\n275\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.220\nAnd then much like a printer,\nit's got a stepper motor.\n\n276\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.910\nSo if you look at the inkjet printers\nthat we talk about right, and\n\n277\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.140\nthe print head goes back and\nforth, if you will.\n\n278\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.040\nWell this concept is really the same,\nit's got a separate motor that\n\n279\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.190\npulls a lens down, and as that lens\ncomes down it's taking pictures and\n\n280\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.350\nthe slower that it moves,\nthe higher the resolution of the picture.\n\n281\n00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.180\nHowever, keep in mind that a lot of this\nfunctionality we find today is built right\n\n282\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.430\ninto multi functioning devices,\nMFDs if you will.\n\n283\n00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.140\nAgain, any time you have some kind of\nmultifunctioning device though I want you\n\n284\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.210\ndo keep in mind that\nthe multifunctioning device,\n\n285\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.560\nit'll do each one of\nthose functionalities.\n\n286\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.850\nSaves you money, right?\n\n287\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.850\nMore economical.\n\n288\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.700\nYou don't have to buy all of your devices,\nfurniture, and then put them up in a room,\n\n289\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.620\nright, because again,\nyou get space saving.\n\n290\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.040\nHowever, single dedicated devices, a lot\nof times, will perform the functionality\n\n291\n00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.480\nbetter than a device that's performing\nmultiple functionalities at the same time.\n\n292\n00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.650\nSo, that is something to\ntake into consideration.\n\n293\n00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.360\nMFD, great, right, love them.\n\n294\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.550\nYou can have them in your house.\n\n295\n00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.670\nYou don't have to have an entire desk\njust for all these peripheral devices.\n\n296\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.950\nHowever if you have a device that is\ndedicated to a single functionality,\n\n297\n00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.450\nthat means it's sole existence\nis to perform nothing but\n\n298\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.190\nthat functionality that it brings to you.\n\n299\n00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.790\nAlright, moving down the list we have\nwhat are known as bar code readers.\n\n300\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.060\nBar code readers is a very\nsimplistic way of encoding text and\n\n301\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.830\nthen scanning it with some\nkind of optical sensor.\n\n302\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.420\nSome photosensor if you will.\n\n303\n00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.670\nIt could be laser based bar code scanners,\nit could be some kind of optical scanner.\n\n304\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.410\nWith the prevalence of QR codes today too\nthey could do it just through cameras,\n\n305\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.310\nthey don't really need lasers as much.\n\n306\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.800\nBut you've probably seen them before\nif you've ever gone to any store, and\n\n307\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.348\nif you've got maybe a piece of plywood\nat your Home Depot or whatever.\n\n308\n00:15:19.348 --> 00:15:23.800\nYou're not gonna scan that if you will\nacross the optical sensor on the table.\n\n309\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.160\nAnd they got a little guns.\n\n310\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.080\n&gt;&gt; A handheld scanner.\n\n311\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.180\n&gt;&gt; A handheld scanner, thank you.\n\n312\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.030\nYeah and they come out and they scan\nthe UPC that's on the back of it.\n\n313\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:38.780\nAgain, if you also have scanners out\nthere as well today with QC codes\n\n314\n00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.400\nbar code scanner keep in mind is directly\nrelated to the laser scanner if you will.\n\n315\n00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.603\nIt is scanning those bar codes or\nthe UPC symbols that are on the back.\n\n316\n00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:51.100\nWe also have things like\nbiometrics readers.\n\n317\n00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.501\nWhen we talk about biometrics\nbased device, if you will,\n\n318\n00:15:53.501 --> 00:15:56.049\nessentially what you're talking\nabout is authentication.\n\n319\n00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:58.613\nWhen we get into other episodes\nwe'll talk about security.\n\n320\n00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:01.815\nWe'll talk about biometrics as\nwell as being a way that you can\n\n321\n00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:06.250\nprove the identity of a user by using some\nphysical or sociological characteristic,\n\n322\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.110\nwhether it's voice recognition.\n\n323\n00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.684\nIn this case, a biometrics reader\ncould be a thumbprint scanner.\n\n324\n00:16:10.684 --> 00:16:13.836\nIt's one of the most common ones\nthat you have on your devices,\n\n325\n00:16:13.836 --> 00:16:16.940\neven your handheld devices,\nlike cell phones, if you will.\n\n326\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.090\nIt could be some kind of facial\nrecognition type system.\n\n327\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.190\nIt could be built into\na web cam if you will,\n\n328\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.270\nbait right there in your\nthings like your laptops, too.\n\n329\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:30.420\nBut again, keep in mind a biometrics\ndevice is one of those devices that\n\n330\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.250\nperipherals, it's all about security.\n\n331\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.080\nAnd it can enhance the security\nof a system by using that\n\n332\n00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.070\nphysical characteristic of yourself\nthat's typically relatively difficult to\n\n333\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.000\nreplicate, if you will.\n\n334\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.020\nI'm not saying it's impossible,\ncuz as you'll go on and learn, Dan,\n\n335\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.010\nI know you're well aware of.\n\n336\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.437\nYou never say never in security cuz just\nwhen you think somebody can't do it,\n\n337\n00:16:48.437 --> 00:16:50.030\nthey'll prove you wrong for sure.\n\n338\n00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.930\nAll right, what else do we got as well?\n\n339\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.050\nWe've got game pads.\n\n340\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.990\nGame pads, I remember when I first seen\nthis I said, game pad, all right, well,\n\n341\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.950\nwe're going back to Nintendo.\n\n342\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.780\nWe're talking about the old\ngame pad that they had.\n\n343\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.140\nBut really we're talking\nabout hand held controllers.\n\n344\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.500\nIf you have Playstations out there,\nyou have Xbox out there,\n\n345\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.070\nany kind of gaming system, you're\ntalking about the gaming controllers.\n\n346\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.910\nAnd yes, you can get those\nconnected to your machines.\n\n347\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.300\nAnd again, like we've talked\nabout with any peripheral device,\n\n348\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.990\nit could be a wired connection or\nit could be a wireless connection.\n\n349\n00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.190\nKeep in mind that the wired connection,\nany time you've got a wired connection,\n\n350\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.380\na lot of times you get a faster speed.\n\n351\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.442\nSo you will see things like gamers\nthat will sometimes won't use\n\n352\n00:17:25.442 --> 00:17:29.299\na wireless connection because they don't\nspend all the money on their devices,\n\n353\n00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:33.116\nright, to get a good experience just to\nhave some kind of latency in the device.\n\n354\n00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:35.850\nAnd sometimes that works for\nkeyboards as well.\n\n355\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.550\nWhereas a wired connection,\n\n356\n00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.860\nyou're using electromagnetic energy that's\nbeing injected right into the computer.\n\n357\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.470\nSo again, we're talking about less delay,\nif you will.\n\n358\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.240\n&gt;&gt; That's someone that's taking\ntheir gaming a bit serious.\n\n359\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\nWell, you think about,\n\n360\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.070\nif I just spent $5,000\non my gaming rig and\n\n361\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.020\nI can't get the headshot because\nI gotta wait for an input.\n\n362\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, now that it's business,\n\n363\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.230\nthat's amazing to me that when\nwe were kids that was a joke.\n\n364\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.510\nLike here's a kid playing Nintendo again.\n\n365\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.067\nAnd now people actually make\na living playing video games.\n\n366\n00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:05.970\n&gt;&gt; And let me go ahead and stop.\n\n367\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.700\nI'd like to expand on that idea,\nbecause we ask what moves this industry.\n\n368\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.200\nTwo major contributing factors,\ncorporations and gamers.\n\n369\n00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.100\nWhy?\n\n370\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.680\n&gt;&gt; I have a PC sitting in my house\nthat I've had for eight years.\n\n371\n00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.130\nI'm not the one that's supporting\nthe PC industry right now, right?\n\n372\n00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.705\nBut gamers bought that PC.\n\n373\n00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:24.631\nThey spent all the money on that PC and\n\n374\n00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:28.160\nthen something comes out that's\nnew that blows that away.\n\n375\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.980\nGuess what?\n\n376\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.050\nThey're gonna buy it.\n\n377\n00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.140\nCorporations have life spans of around\nthree years of expensive devices,\n\n378\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.220\nmaybe five at the max, and\nguess what they have to do?\n\n379\n00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.499\nThey have to buy something else.\n\n380\n00:18:38.499 --> 00:18:40.830\nSo they are really,\nI'm glad you brought that up.\n\n381\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.130\nIt is,\nyou couldn't be more correct on that and\n\n382\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.540\nthe fact that they're the ones\nthat move the industry.\n\n383\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.520\nWhere we used to be just kids\ngrabbing our game consoles-\n\n384\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.308\n&gt;&gt; And having a good time.\n\n385\n00:18:49.308 --> 00:18:51.956\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\ntaking them over to somebody's house and\n\n386\n00:18:51.956 --> 00:18:53.600\nsitting around them for hours.\n\n387\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.320\nBut yeah, really,\n\n388\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.090\nthose are the two entities that really\nmove the entire computer industry,\n\n389\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:04.710\nbecause they can afford to spend more and\nmore money when it comes down to it.\n\n390\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.600\nNow we also have other types of things,\n\n391\n00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.040\nother types of peripherals\nthat they have to talk about.\n\n392\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.000\nAnd speaking of gaming, that leads\nus right into the next one, Dan.\n\n393\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.445\nSo great timing, it looks like you\nhave done this once or twice, sir.\n\n394\n00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:17.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've got a joystick right here, and\n\n395\n00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.050\njust like the game pads, right?\n\n396\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.100\nWe talk about little controllers,\nso if we'll take a look at this,\n\n397\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.870\nthis is an oldie but goodie as well.\n\n398\n00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.819\nIn fact, this came from the same\ncloset that the scanner did, too.\n\n399\n00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:32.290\nYou remember-\n&gt;&gt; It's got the same closet dust.\n\n400\n00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.930\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it does, it sure does.\n\n401\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.520\nYou know what kind of a game\nstick this is, right?\n\n402\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.156\n&gt;&gt; It's a sidewinder.\n\n403\n00:19:37.156 --> 00:19:41.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you could tell,\nDan definitely has been a gamer now.\n\n404\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.730\nI know when you have kids and\na job, it kinda takes a backseat.\n\n405\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.120\nBoy, there was a time when\nthis was probably front and\n\n406\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.220\ncenter in your life, right.\n\n407\n00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.140\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's a lot of fun,\nyou know, you want to play games.\n\n408\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.490\nGames are meant to be fun, and\nyou want to enhance your experience.\n\n409\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.130\nSo the community realizes that, so\n\n410\n00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.360\nthey create a peripheral that\nwill do that very thing.\n\n411\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.920\nI mean, we've seen, not only things\nlike the sidewinder here but\n\n412\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.080\nthe race car controllers with full foot\npedals and throttles, you name it.\n\n413\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.730\nIt can get a little ridiculous,\nto be honest with you.\n\n414\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.450\nAnd if you've got the money to spend, they\nwill be more than happy to take it out of\n\n415\n00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.081\nyour wallet and give you something very\ncool to slap in front of your computer.\n\n416\n00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:17.999\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Heck, yeah, and again,\n\n417\n00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:22.753\nsix months from now it's the old stuff,\nyou're gonna have to buy something new.\n\n418\n00:20:22.753 --> 00:20:25.216\nSo again,\nit's one of those perpetual cycles, right,\n\n419\n00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:27.180\nthat just keeps going over and\nover and over.\n\n420\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.079\n&gt;&gt; I was always the kind of\nperson that bought the junk.\n\n421\n00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:31.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n422\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.840\n&gt;&gt; That's two generations old.\n\n423\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.171\nYeah, and it was $12 instead of the 140\nthat it was when it was brand new.\n\n424\n00:20:36.171 --> 00:20:38.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, just like going through college.\n\n425\n00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.890\nWhat did you eat?\n\n426\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.060\nI didn't go out to a restaurant.\n\n427\n00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.180\nI ate Goldfish and Pop-Tarts for\nthe next four years.\n\n428\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.879\n&gt;&gt; Cup of ramen soup.\n\n429\n00:20:43.879 --> 00:20:44.819\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n430\n00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:48.000\nSo keep in mind the connections\nhave changed like this.\n\n431\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.390\nAgain, wireless connections,\nwired connections are very,\n\n432\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.330\nvery common for this.\n\n433\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.020\nAnd it's not because they're\noutdated by any means, but\n\n434\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.700\nagain you get a better functionality.\n\n435\n00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.270\nI don't have to worry about the batteries\ndying in the middle of the game.\n\n436\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.670\nA couple other things that they talk\nabout that I really don't have any\n\n437\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.520\nexamples here for.\n\n438\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.380\nThey talk about a digitizer with the fact\nthat touchscreens have become so\n\n439\n00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.180\nprevalent today.\n\n440\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.640\nDigitizers are still out there.\n\n441\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.791\nWe still use them.\n\n442\n00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:15.445\n&gt;&gt; And for a while they were a real\ncommon way to interact with some kind of\n\n443\n00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:17.430\ninput display, right?\n\n444\n00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.450\nA digitizer typically is\ndifferent than a stylus.\n\n445\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.140\nIt looks a lot like a stylus but\n\n446\n00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.580\nusually what it has is it has some kind\nof logic circuit board built in it.\n\n447\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.500\nLooks like a pen, if you will, and\na lot of times it has a driver.\n\n448\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.360\nAnd again that piece of software\nthat allows your operating system to\n\n449\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.850\ncommunicate with your hardware.\n\n450\n00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.880\nAnd what you do is essentially\nyou will press, well,\n\n451\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.420\nit could be capactive touch or\nresistive touch.\n\n452\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.780\nI've seen some of these digitizers,\nlike Eno boards,\n\n453\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.470\nthat's an interactive whiteboard.\n\n454\n00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.730\nBut the entire whiteboard, if you were\nto magnify it, actually just take\n\n455\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.960\na magnifying glass up to it, you'd see\nit's nothing but one big, huge QR code.\n\n456\n00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.490\nAnd what the digitizer does is it's got an\noptical pen with an optical point in it,\n\n457\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.480\nand it actually takes\na picture of where you are to\n\n458\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.210\ntrack where you are communicating\nwith that interactive whiteboard.\n\n459\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.460\nIt could be resistive touch, if you will,\n\n460\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.150\nthat's actually a series of resistive\nlayers that when you press down onto it\n\n461\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.980\nit takes two metal films and\npresses them together.\n\n462\n00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.690\nAnd that's how the input\ntracks where you are.\n\n463\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.770\nSo again, digitizers,\nyou could have those as well.\n\n464\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.592\nCommonly found in things like interactive\nwhiteboards as well as things like\n\n465\n00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:28.640\ncapactive touchscreens as well\nas resistor touchscreens, too.\n\n466\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.852\nMotion sensors, motion sensors\nare exactly what they sound like.\n\n467\n00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:34.666\nA lot of times your motion sensors\ncould be a couple of different things.\n\n468\n00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:38.824\nIt could be infrared in the fact that\nit's tracking abrupt changes and\n\n469\n00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:41.301\nheat patterns, a little bit different.\n\n470\n00:22:41.301 --> 00:22:43.170\nYou might say, wait a second.\n\n471\n00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:48.020\nIf it's a motion sensor, how does it\ndistinguish heat patterns from the sun?\n\n472\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.180\nWell, the sun is very,\nvery gradual, right?\n\n473\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.621\nIt doesn't come up immediately,\n\n474\n00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:53.862\neven though sometimes when\nwe're tired we think so.\n\n475\n00:22:53.862 --> 00:22:55.673\n[LAUGH] It doesn't come immediately, so\n\n476\n00:22:55.673 --> 00:22:59.200\nthat's a very gradual change versus\nsomebody walking in front of the sensor.\n\n477\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.480\nAnd it abruptly changes\nthe heat signature.\n\n478\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.840\nIf you think about one of our\nfavorite movies, I know, is Predator.\n\n479\n00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.398\nThink about that abrupt change in the heat\nsignature and that's what it's detecting.\n\n480\n00:23:08.398 --> 00:23:10.685\nAgain, it could be acoustic wave,\nand again,\n\n481\n00:23:10.685 --> 00:23:13.030\nit's sending out some\nkind of acoustic wave.\n\n482\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.590\nNot acoustic wave, I'm sorry,\nradio frequency wave.\n\n483\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.150\nAnd just kind of like the ping system,\n\n484\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.660\nsonar system that you would find\ninside of like a militarian as well,\n\n485\n00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:27.110\nis that it reflects that radio wave back\nto the sensor and it detects that as well.\n\n486\n00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.641\nSo again, motion sensors are also\nsomething that we have to think about.\n\n487\n00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:35.190\nTouchpads, all right, well, there's\na few different types of touchpads.\n\n488\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.110\nIn fact, I've got one that we use.\n\n489\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.420\nDan, you see here,\nwe've got an example of one.\n\n490\n00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.685\nAnd most of the hosts, a lot of the hosts,\nare using Apple based devices.\n\n491\n00:23:42.685 --> 00:23:48.220\nWe're using one of these touchpads, and\nagain, this is called a MagicPad again.\n\n492\n00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.100\nThe Mac itself here,\nalso both of our Macs have one.\n\n493\n00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.087\nThis is common is laptops, right?\n\n494\n00:23:53.087 --> 00:23:56.314\nBut I do want you to understand that we'll\ntalk about laptop input devices a little\n\n495\n00:23:56.314 --> 00:23:59.380\nbit different,\nbecause we're talking about peripherals.\n\n496\n00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.529\nVersus an integrated device.\n\n497\n00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:03.182\nConcept is the same,\nconceptually they're doing the same thing.\n\n498\n00:24:03.182 --> 00:24:04.834\nLike if I was to press on this one,\n\n499\n00:24:04.834 --> 00:24:08.140\nI could feel the same type of clicks\nthat I could on this one as well.\n\n500\n00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.060\nBut you also have things like touchpads\nthat are on point of sale systems.\n\n501\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.750\nAnd that's another thing to keep in mind,\nis that if you've ever for instance,\n\n502\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.070\nhad to sign a receipt, right,\nyou're using a stylus.\n\n503\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.690\nYou could see that those are also touch\npads as well, interacting logitech makes\n\n504\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.270\nthem too, as you know on point\nof sale systems likewise.\n\n505\n00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.290\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n506\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.350\nWe've got some other things\nthat we gotta talk about.\n\n507\n00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.480\nWe've got smart card readers.\n\n508\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.100\nSmart card readers and external periphery,\na lot of times it's built into things like\n\n509\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.610\nyour laptops or your computers,\nthe front face of the system unit as well.\n\n510\n00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.120\nBut if it doesn't, if you don't have it,\n\n511\n00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.000\nremember peripherals allow you to add\nfunctionality to your computer experience.\n\n512\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.790\nSo we could plug these in like for\ninstance external USB devices and\n\n513\n00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.720\nwe could slip those cards in there\nthat would allow us to essentially\n\n514\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.260\nread things like SD cards, if you will.\n\n515\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.670\nRead all different kinds,\nMMC all the old MMC cards, likewise too.\n\n516\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.241\nEven earlier things like compact flash.\n\n517\n00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:07.178\nSo, a lot of times what they are,\n\n518\n00:25:07.178 --> 00:25:10.720\nis they support multiples of\nthese cards in a single device.\n\n519\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.060\nSo, pay attention when you are considering\nwhether you are gonna buy one of those,\n\n520\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.380\nwhat formats they support.\n\n521\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.560\nYou might see things like 24 and 1,\n\n522\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.140\nthat means one device supports 24\ndifferent type of card formats.\n\n523\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.660\nSo it might be a limiting factor,\nit might be that decision that you make.\n\n524\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.520\nAll right, a handful of other ones now.\n\n525\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.090\nAnd I know we got a laundry list here.\n\n526\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.900\nDigital cameras, again, digital cameras,\nkeep in mind what they allow you to do is\n\n527\n00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.060\nessentially take,\nif you don't have a smart card reader.\n\n528\n00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.370\nA lot of times you have some kind of\nwired connection that you can make\n\n529\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.710\nInto plugging the device into your\ncomputer, transferring the photos.\n\n530\n00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.460\nAnd Dan,\nI know you're heavily into photography,\n\n531\n00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.630\ntransferring those photos\nfrom your camera to your car.\n\n532\n00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.450\nNow i'm gonna throw you off on this one,\nDan.\n\n533\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.583\nWill you say, cuz I know you\ntake high resolution pictures.\n\n534\n00:25:56.583 --> 00:26:00.338\nWould you say it's more efficient to\ntransfer over a good smart card reader or\n\n535\n00:26:00.338 --> 00:26:04.000\ndo you find a good camera will also give\nyou the same speeds of the transfer?\n\n536\n00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.544\n&gt;&gt; Well they use USB, so\nwhatever the USB versus and\n\n537\n00:26:07.544 --> 00:26:10.575\nI think that smart card reading is USB2.\n\n538\n00:26:10.575 --> 00:26:11.151\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n539\n00:26:11.151 --> 00:26:15.630\n&gt;&gt; So if you're using a USB2 cable,\nit'd be the same, it'd be the same.\n\n540\n00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.580\nIf you have a USB3 camera,\ndifferent story obviously.\n\n541\n00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.620\nAnd now a lot of cameras have\nwi-fi built into them so\n\n542\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.465\nyou can just connect wirelessly.\n\n543\n00:26:22.465 --> 00:26:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Interesting,\nyou try to throw someone a curve ball and\n\n544\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:26.770\nhe knocks it out of the ballpark.\n\n545\n00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.049\nI'm not playing baseball with you anymore.\n\n546\n00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:33.590\n[LAUGH] All right, so Again,\nkeep in mind you do have digital cameras.\n\n547\n00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.970\nWe're not gonna get into\npromoting digital cameras.\n\n548\n00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.200\nYou wanna ask what a good digital\ncamera is, ask it on our forums and\n\n549\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.410\nDan can jump in there,\nhe might give you some tips on that one.\n\n550\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.180\nOther things that we have are web cams,\nand\n\n551\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.500\nI've actually got an example\nof a web cam here.\n\n552\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.075\nAnd these are all different types,\nall different kinds.\n\n553\n00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:54.200\nHigh definition resolution today,\na lot of them are high definition.\n\n554\n00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.190\nThey can get very, very expensive,\nthis one isn't too expensive.\n\n555\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.615\n&gt;&gt; This is the exact one we're\nusing to shoot the show [LAUGH]\n\n556\n00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:01.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not really but\n\n557\n00:27:01.682 --> 00:27:05.572\nwhen you you think about it and that\nkinda lens itself, two things like for\n\n558\n00:27:05.572 --> 00:27:08.470\ninstance how expensive some\nof these webcams can get.\n\n559\n00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:11.820\nI have seen some webcams,\nif you will, that were connected to\n\n560\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.380\nhigh definition conferencing systems that\nwere $8,000 just for the camera itself.\n\n561\n00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.030\nAlso, pay attention to the connection.\n\n562\n00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.130\nYes, this is USB.\n\n563\n00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.750\nFor the longest time and\nsome still swear by it,\n\n564\n00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.480\nthat FireWire does a much better job\nwhen it comes to high definition video.\n\n565\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.457\nHowever, USB seems to be a little bit\nmore prevalent within our system, so\n\n566\n00:27:29.457 --> 00:27:31.110\nit is a commonality likewise.\n\n567\n00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.600\nAll right, so we've got the web cam.\n\n568\n00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.120\nLast one, as far as our input devices,\nevery one of these devices that we've been\n\n569\n00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.520\ntalking about, guys and gals out there\nkeep in mind, is an input device.\n\n570\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.210\nI said that I would mention that.\n\n571\n00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.550\n&gt;&gt; And I mention now on the last one,\nso we did have to keep that in mind.\n\n572\n00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.620\nAnd that's a camcorder.\n\n573\n00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.890\nA camcorder again,\na lot of times you have digital\n\n574\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:55.660\nvideo that you have to take, and\ncamcorders allow you to do that.\n\n575\n00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.800\nA lot of times you'll see\ncamcorders in things like, built in\n\n576\n00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.310\nto digital cameras and camcorders,\nthey're all in the same thing, right?\n\n577\n00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.130\nIf I can take a high definition video,\n\n578\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.350\nwhat's the difference between taking a\nsnapshot on that high definition video and\n\n579\n00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.710\nyou can have again a multi\nfunctioning device likewise.\n\n580\n00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:15.405\nAll right, so I'll put devices real quick,\nprinters, right?\n\n581\n00:28:15.405 --> 00:28:16.155\nIt's printed media.\n\n582\n00:28:16.155 --> 00:28:18.095\nWe talked about printers\nin another episode.\n\n583\n00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:21.115\nSpeakers, when we talk,\nit's an audio output device.\n\n584\n00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:23.455\nAnd, again, we talked about things\nlike your sound cards give you\n\n585\n00:28:23.455 --> 00:28:24.355\nthe surround sound.\n\n586\n00:28:24.355 --> 00:28:26.617\nYou might see seeing things\nlike 7 to 1 and 5 to 1.\n\n587\n00:28:26.617 --> 00:28:30.197\nAnd that's how many speakers you\nhave typically to one subwoofer.\n\n588\n00:28:30.197 --> 00:28:32.567\nSo you keep in mind that\ntype of configuration.\n\n589\n00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:33.815\nAnd we also have display devices.\n\n590\n00:28:33.815 --> 00:28:37.325\nWe have an episode that goes\nheavily in display devices but\n\n591\n00:28:37.325 --> 00:28:42.267\nthis is how we see the results of\nthe input that we put within the systems.\n\n592\n00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:43.757\nNow, some devices are both.\n\n593\n00:28:43.757 --> 00:28:46.157\nSome devices are input and output, right.\n\n594\n00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:47.740\nA touchscreen.\n\n595\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.080\nAll right, a touch screen like on an iPad.\n\n596\n00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.919\nThat's an example of an input\noutput device, right?\n\n597\n00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:53.993\nI can input data by touching the screen,\n\n598\n00:28:53.993 --> 00:28:58.300\nat the same time display the results\nof that data on that same very screen.\n\n599\n00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.476\nWe have things like KBMs.\n\n600\n00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:04.050\nNow when we talk about KBMs,\nif you're not familiar with this,\n\n601\n00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:08.680\nI've actually a picture pulled\nup of one on my computer here.\n\n602\n00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.990\nAnd this is a Belkin, right and they\ncome in all different shapes and sizes.\n\n603\n00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.500\nAnd essentially what\nthis allows you to do.\n\n604\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.640\nYou'll see this in a couple different\nareas, right, you'll see this in tech\n\n605\n00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.060\nbenches as well as in your server\nclosets and I want you to think about\n\n606\n00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.655\nbringing multiple computers into a tech\ncompany that's gonna work on them, right?\n\n607\n00:29:23.655 --> 00:29:28.515\nThey don't wanna have 15 monitors,\n16 monitors stacked up with 16 keyboards,\n\n608\n00:29:28.515 --> 00:29:32.795\n16 mice all across their tech bench\nwhere they can put one of these KBM,\n\n609\n00:29:32.795 --> 00:29:36.600\nkeyboard video mouse,\nis where the name comes from.\n\n610\n00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.320\nAnd they can plug a single monitor,\na single mouse and\n\n611\n00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.720\na single keyboard into the front of this\nand they can plug all of the PCs, or\n\n612\n00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.820\nall the computers that they're working on\ninto this single box and with a button or\n\n613\n00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.190\na keyboard shortcut they can flip\nbetween the different displays and\n\n614\n00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.640\ncontrol multiple computers\nthrough a single device.\n\n615\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.770\nYou also do with servers.\n\n616\n00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.400\nYou'll have 1,000 servers in\na server closet potentially,\n\n617\n00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.220\nyou don't wanna have 1,000 monitors,\n1,000 keyboards, 1,000 mice.\n\n618\n00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.690\nSo what they have is multiples of these\nKVMs and then you connect to the KVM.\n\n619\n00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.320\nTypically you're already connected to\nthe KVM with some kind of single keyboard,\n\n620\n00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.100\nmonitor, and mouse.\n\n621\n00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.850\nAnd you can control every one of them.\n\n622\n00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.430\nA couple things I wanna talk about,\n\n623\n00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.703\nthere's also what's\nknown as a top set box.\n\n624\n00:30:22.703 --> 00:30:23.831\nGuys and gals, don't let this confuse.\n&gt;&gt; A set top box.\n\n625\n00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:25.405\n&gt;&gt; A set top box, yes.\n\n626\n00:30:25.405 --> 00:30:26.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A set top box,\n\n627\n00:30:26.122 --> 00:30:27.365\nwe'll get this right eventually, right?\n\n628\n00:30:27.365 --> 00:30:30.680\nLet me put the [LAUGH] carriage, or the\nhorse right in front of the carriage, or\n\n629\n00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.470\nthe carriage right in front of the horse.\n\n630\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.620\nWe'll figure it out eventually\n[LAUGH] that's right.\n\n631\n00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.030\nThe set top box, guys.\n\n632\n00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.170\nIt's cable aux, right?\n\n633\n00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.950\nThings like as well as TiVo boxes-\n&gt;&gt; Satellite.\n\n634\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.030\n&gt;&gt; Satellite boxes.\n\n635\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.950\nThank you.\nAbsolutely.\n\n636\n00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:47.090\n&gt;&gt; DVR's\n&gt;&gt; DVR's another one, great one, as well,\n\n637\n00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.330\nthat we need to, and\nthey call them set top boxes.\n\n638\n00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.405\nSitting on the TV set, right?\n\n639\n00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:53.460\n[LAUGH] On top of the TV set.\n\n640\n00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Aptly named.\n\n641\n00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good.\n\n642\n00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.450\nIt's almost like they knew what\nthey were doing on that one.\n\n643\n00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Last\n\n644\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.010\none I wanna mention is\na midi-enabled device.\n\n645\n00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.540\nThis essentially allows you to turn your\ncomputer into a recording studio, right?\n\n646\n00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:10.500\nYou can take instruments, digitize the\ninformation and send it into a computer.\n\n647\n00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.080\nA lot of people do this when they're\ndoing things like home recording,\n\n648\n00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.400\nif you will, as well.\n\n649\n00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:15.940\nGreat thing.\n\n650\n00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:21.391\nMulti, what is it, [CROSSTALK] it's\nmusical instrument digital interface.\n\n651\n00:31:21.391 --> 00:31:23.130\nThank you.\nWow see.\n\n652\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.330\nYou got that acronym right too.\n\n653\n00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:24.851\n&gt;&gt; We're musicians.\n\n654\n00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:25.998\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah very good.\n\n655\n00:31:25.998 --> 00:31:28.440\nThat's right.\n[LAUGH] All right ladies and gentlemen,\n\n656\n00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.390\nlike I said, I know it's a laundry list.\n\n657\n00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.518\nDan's now broke with all the things we've\nhad to buy with his credit card here.\n\n658\n00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:36.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hello?\n\n659\n00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:37.030\nWhat?\n\n660\n00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Should have told him\nprior to us starting.\n\n661\n00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.730\nSo guys and gals again,\nkeep in mind input devices and\n\n662\n00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.630\noutput devices and then the handful\nat the end that we mentioned.\n\n663\n00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.210\nThey kind of sit on both\nsides of the tracks.\n\n664\n00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.503\nThey can be input and\noutput devices for your 901 exam.\n\n665\n00:31:49.503 --> 00:31:53.450\n&gt;&gt; All right everyone, well it looks like\nI've got some business to take care of.\n\n666\n00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.830\nAnd some credit card\ntransactions to get rid of.\n\n667\n00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.520\nBut Wes, we thank you for\nwalking us through,\n\n668\n00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.430\nthere's a multitude of peripheral devices\nthat you might connect to your computer.\n\n669\n00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.230\nWe just want you to be familiar with\nthe most common that you might run into\n\n670\n00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.080\nout there as an A+ technician.\n\n671\n00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.140\nUnderstand how they connect,\nwhat they do and how they work.\n\n672\n00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.530\nThat being said, looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n673\n00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.390\nWe thank you for watching, signing off for\nITProTV, I've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n674\n00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.074\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n675\n00:32:17.074 --> 00:32:19.367\nWe'll see you next time.\n\n676\n00:32:19.367 --> 00:32:25.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n677\n00:32:25.354 --> 00:32:27.385\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:17.071\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.147\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:23.360\nwe are moving forward with\nmore in our A+ 22901 series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.330\nAnd joining us yet again in the studio,\nour good friend and mentor, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.554\nWes, I'm so glad to have you again,\nman, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:33.216\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nreally thrilled to be here, that's right,\n\n12\n00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.403\nwe're gonna be looking at the bane\nof all IT existence today.\n\n13\n00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:40.297\nYeah, we're gonna be talking a little\nbit about printers and their drivers,\n\n14\n00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:42.220\nthings that like to drive us mad.\n\n15\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.020\nNo, just kidding, guys, but\nwe do have to talk about printing.\n\n16\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.908\nRemember, in your IT career,\nthe whole entire network and\n\n17\n00:00:47.908 --> 00:00:50.795\neverything can fail, but\nif one printer is still working,\n\n18\n00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:53.355\nyou can always print your\nresume out the front door.\n\n19\n00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:58.052\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna be looking at a\nlittle bit of different technologies that\n\n20\n00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:01.183\ndo surround, specifically,\nSOHOs, MFDs, yes,\n\n21\n00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:04.190\nacronyms right out the gate here,\nand printers.\n\n22\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.142\nNow MFD, if you will, guys,\nsorry for the alphabet soup, but\n\n23\n00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:09.005\nthat is a multi-functioning device.\n\n24\n00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.249\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:14.614\nstep back real quick before we get into\nthe specifics of this episode here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:18.655\nAnd let's talk about these acronyms\nthat we've kinda fed you right away.\n\n27\n00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.065\nSOHO, what is that?\n\n28\n00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:22.475\nSmall office home office, right?\n\n29\n00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:25.260\nIt's not even an SMB, right,\nsmall to medium business, right,\n\n30\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.324\nwe can have a couple hundred employees,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:31.172\nCan even be considered a small business,\nsmall office, home office, a lot of times,\n\n32\n00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:34.408\nwhat we're talking about is no more\nthan ten computers at best, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.408 --> 00:01:38.862\nSo a very isolated type of\noffice environment, if you will.\n\n34\n00:01:38.862 --> 00:01:43.583\nAnd isolated, I just mean very,\nvery limited in the overall expense,\n\n35\n00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:48.235\nlimited in the amount of devices and\npeople that you have inside of it.\n\n36\n00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:50.354\nMFDs, well, what's an MFD?\n\n37\n00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:52.438\nWell, that's a multi-functioning device.\n\n38\n00:01:52.438 --> 00:01:56.065\nWell, I mean,\nwhat is a multi-functioning device?\n\n39\n00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.275\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a trip back in time, and\n\n40\n00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:01.280\nlet's talk about in the days when\nyou would, what would you do?\n\n41\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.635\nYou would buy a fax machine,\nyou'd buy a printer.\n\n42\n00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:08.680\nYou'd buy a copier, right,\nwhat else would you do?\n\n43\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.880\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a scanner.\n\n44\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good,\nthe old flatbed scanners, right?\n\n45\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.440\nAnd then what else would you have to do?\n\n46\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.031\nYou turn around and you would have to\nbuy furniture for your equipment, right?\n\n47\n00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:22.222\nYou have to buy a desk,\nand even more so then,\n\n48\n00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:25.652\nyou would put the kids in a bunk bed and\nyou would move it into an office.\n\n49\n00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:27.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I want you to think about this.\n\n50\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.178\nYou just bought a whole bunch of inanimate\nobjects, not only their own furniture, but\n\n51\n00:02:32.178 --> 00:02:34.609\nyou put them up for\nthe night in their own room.\n\n52\n00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.785\nSo these devices, as time went on,\n\n53\n00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:40.935\na lot of the major manufacturers\nout there said hey, you know what?\n\n54\n00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:45.280\nWell, let's see if we can save some\nspace and also save some money here,\n\n55\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.359\nif you will,\nmake it more economically feasible.\n\n56\n00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.943\nWe'll have all these devices, and\nwe'll just integrate them into one device.\n\n57\n00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:56.363\nNow I do want you to keep in my mind when\nyou have a multi-functioning device,\n\n58\n00:02:56.363 --> 00:03:00.987\nwhat you have is one single device that\nis basically allocating its resources and\n\n59\n00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:04.598\nfunctionality to different\ntypes of functionality, right?\n\n60\n00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:10.151\nSo, that is going to be something that\ncan be a limitng factor with MFDs.\n\n61\n00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.177\nAny time you've got one device that's\ndedicated to a single functionality,\n\n62\n00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:17.959\nits sole existence revolves around\nthat functionality, a lot of times,\n\n63\n00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.218\nyou get a really good\nperformance out of it.\n\n64\n00:03:20.218 --> 00:03:22.735\nVersus one that kind of divides\nthe functionality between\n\n65\n00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.975\nmultiple different roles.\n\n66\n00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:30.470\nHowever, they're cost effective, and\nagain, they do save you some space.\n\n67\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.650\nSo that's a little bit about the SOHO, and\n\n68\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.880\nthat is a little bit about\nmulti-functioning devices.\n\n69\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.036\nAnd again, the objectives here, install\nSOHO, multi-functioning device printers,\n\n70\n00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:42.439\nand configure appropriate settings\nare what we're gonna be looking at.\n\n71\n00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.420\nAnd one of the first things that they\ndive into is talking about configuring,\n\n72\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.573\nusing appropriate drivers, all right.\n\n73\n00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:52.320\nWhen we talk about a driver, we've kind\nof talked about, as we've mentioned,\n\n74\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.880\nhardware.\n\n75\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.279\nAnd as we'll mention,\nwhen we get into our operating system,\n\n76\n00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.480\nkind of looking at what\nthese little components are.\n\n77\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.890\nIt's really just a piece of software\nthat allows us to control our hardware.\n\n78\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.800\nRight, our operating system\nbasically controls our hardware.\n\n79\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.020\nBut the only way you could control that\nhardware or even be aware of what that\n\n80\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.600\nhardware actually is, is through that\nlittle translator that explains what it is\n\n81\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.660\nand lets it talk to it,\nthe drivers themselves.\n\n82\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.930\nPrint drivers, they can be a nightmare,\nall right, but\n\n83\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.190\nif you're aware of the available drivers,\nthe type of drivers, and\n\n84\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.960\nyou know where to look for them, they\ncan also be very simplistic, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.090\nSo I got a little list here of the print\ndrivers that I want you to be aware of\n\n86\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.630\non the exam, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.980\nYes, you could see more acronyms,\nright, we have PPD, PCL, and UPD.\n\n88\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.400\n&gt;&gt; All right-\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for clearing that up.\n\n89\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.073\n&gt;&gt; That's right, okay.\n\n90\n00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:40.317\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, moving on, [LAUGH] just kidding,\n\n91\n00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:43.884\nthe first one here, we've got what is\nknown as the post printer description,\n\n92\n00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:45.910\nvery common printer driver.\n\n93\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.110\nThe second one here, we have one that's\nreally been largely used in the HP world,\n\n94\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.130\nthe Hewlett Packard world, and\n\n95\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.200\nthat's the printer control language, as\nwell as the universal print driver, right?\n\n96\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.090\nWe've been talking about\nMFDs just briefly, right?\n\n97\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.760\nWell, a universal print driver is\ngood because well, think about it,\n\n98\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.400\nuniversal print driver.\n\n99\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.605\nIt works very, very well for\nMFD devices, if you will.\n\n100\n00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:09.154\nI wanna just back up real quick and\nmention in PCL,\n\n101\n00:05:09.154 --> 00:05:12.687\nkeep in mind there are different versions,\nright, PCL 5, PCL 6.\n\n102\n00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:16.940\nPay attention to the manufacturer's\nrecommendations for these drivers.\n\n103\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.647\nAll right,\n\n104\n00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:22.244\nyou have to know that if I am going to\ninstall a printer within my network, I'm\n\n105\n00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:26.942\ngonna have to know what the manufacturer\nrequires when it comes to the driver.\n\n106\n00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:29.012\nNow, there are other types of\ndrivers in here as well, too,\n\n107\n00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:31.220\nyou'll see Raster/Bitmap, and\nyou'll see Plotter Vector.\n\n108\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.910\nWell, what do these mean?\n\n109\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.270\nAnd in fact, I should probably put\na little forward slash there, there we go.\n\n110\n00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:39.614\nWhat is Raster/Bitmap?\n\n111\n00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:43.596\nWell, Raster/Bitmap is a driver,\nessentially,\n\n112\n00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:48.035\nthat doesn't really scale to\nvery large type print jobs.\n\n113\n00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.055\nBecause the Raster/Bitmap kind of gets\npixellated the larger the print job, so\n\n114\n00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:54.196\nthere is a little bit\nof a limiting factor.\n\n115\n00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:58.266\nBut it is pretty much supported just by\nabout almost every printer out there, so\n\n116\n00:05:58.266 --> 00:05:59.430\nvery common printer.\n\n117\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.507\nHowever Plotter/Vector, right,\nwhen we say Plotter/Vector, Dan,\n\n118\n00:06:02.507 --> 00:06:04.154\nI know you were in the military before.\n\n119\n00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:05.946\nYou probably had to look at a map once or\n\n120\n00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:09.920\ntwice where you plot your vector on,\nright, a series of x, y, z coordinates.\n\n121\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.033\nAnd one of the great things about\nPlotter/Vector drivers is because they use\n\n122\n00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:18.729\nthose x, y, z coordinates, they're perfect\nfor very large scale printing, right?\n\n123\n00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.790\n&gt;&gt; I actually worked in sign shops as\na kid when I was in my teenage years.\n\n124\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.250\nAnd we used plotters to\nactually cut out vinyl\n\n125\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.910\nsigns to put on things like boats and\ndoors and things of that nature.\n\n126\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.947\n&gt;&gt; So scalability was just great.\n\n127\n00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:36.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it basically looked like\na giant printer that you fed vinyl\n\n128\n00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.859\nstickers into, giant vinyl stickers.\n\n129\n00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:42.699\nAnd it would cut out whatever you want,\nand you'd have it backed in masts.\n\n130\n00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.004\nAnd you would take it to a glass door and\nyou put it on there and\n\n131\n00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.500\nmake sure it's straight.\n\n132\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.020\nWipe it on, pull the masking off,\nand there's your sign.\n\n133\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.601\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so and you can see, well,\n\n134\n00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.312\nI'm sure some of these signs can\nget fairly huge as well, too.\n\n135\n00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe ones on the boats got very large.\n\n136\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.640\nBecause you'd go off on these\nmulti-million dollar yachts, and\n\n137\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.450\nthey're putting queen's prize or\nsomething.\n\n138\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.370\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And they're as big as me.\n\n139\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.613\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwhen they're spending that money,\n\n140\n00:07:03.613 --> 00:07:04.900\nthey don't want it to look pixellated,\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.892\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n142\n00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:08.912\n&gt;&gt; Today, we look at things like\nMineCraft, and we're like that's awesome,\n\n143\n00:07:08.912 --> 00:07:11.659\nbut I bet you back in the days,\nthey got a couple million dollar yacht.\n\n144\n00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:14.031\nThey wouldn't think that's Galaga, right?\n\n145\n00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.636\n[LAUGH] So, well,\nthat's an Atari boat, but yeah, and\n\n146\n00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:22.710\nthat's some of the print drivers that\nyou have to be aware of on the exam.\n\n147\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.490\nKnow the names,\nknow the acronyms, if you will.\n\n148\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.900\nAgain, keep in mind things like your\n\n149\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.640\nMFD devices work very well with\nthe universal print drivers.\n\n150\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.910\nNow one of the great things about most of\nthese print drivers today is that they\n\n151\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.410\nactually have a small portion of memory.\n\n152\n00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.280\nSometimes a non-volatile memory\nwhere the driver's actually stored\n\n153\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.540\non the firmware within\nthe firmware itself,\n\n154\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.180\nwe've actually got something kinda cool\nthere in one of the printers that we have.\n\n155\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.980\nThe manufacturer actually include\na little USB device that you can just\n\n156\n00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.021\nplug right in.\n\n157\n00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.124\nSo a lot of times,\n\n158\n00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:02.628\nyour manufacturers will include\nthe print drivers within the printer.\n\n159\n00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:05.556\nSo that, we'll talk about shared\nprinters here in a second, but\n\n160\n00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:08.100\nwhen you connect to it,\nthe print driver's ready.\n\n161\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.800\nIt's ready to go, it's ready to install,\nand it makes it really easy for you.\n\n162\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.180\nHowever, one of the things I want you\nto keep in mind about any driver,\n\n163\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.070\nespecially drivers that come on\nan optical drive, come on a thumb drive,\n\n164\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.960\nor come in the firmware itself.\n\n165\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.000\nThe printers can have a long shelf\nlife before you ever buy them.\n\n166\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.276\nHowever, the drivers themselves, they\ntypically don't have a long shelf life.\n\n167\n00:08:28.276 --> 00:08:31.730\nAnd manufacturers as they update their\nproducts they update the, and do\n\n168\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.080\ndebug fixes, if you will inside of their\nprinter, inside of the logic, if you will.\n\n169\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.760\nWhat happens is the drivers\nneed to update.\n\n170\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.540\nSo always check the manufacturer's website\nto make sure that you have the most\n\n171\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.020\ncurrent driver when it comes\nto supporting your printers.\n\n172\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.630\nNow, next thing they talk\nabout is configuring settings.\n\n173\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.360\nSome of the things that we can do,\nlet's talk about this a little bit, right?\n\n174\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.960\nWe have what is known as collating,\nall right?\n\n175\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.150\nVery first thing we'll\ntalk about is collating.\n\n176\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:04.110\nCollate is a very interesting technique in\nthe way that you can make sure that your\n\n177\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.190\npages, when they're printed,\nthey're printed and\n\n178\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.270\nthe output is in a predetermined\narrangement, right?\n\n179\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.550\nSo let's say, for instance, like we print\nour show notes here and I give Dan a copy\n\n180\n00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.430\nof the show notes so he knows kinda\nwhere we're going within this episode.\n\n181\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.350\nWell, if you think about it,\nif we got three pages, all right,\n\n182\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:25.560\nfor each collection of show notes, one for\nme, one for him, that's six pages, right?\n\n183\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.790\nAnd if you're not collating your output,\n\n184\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.230\nit'll print one page and\nit'll print another page one.\n\n185\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.700\nThen page two, and then another page two,\nand then a page three and\n\n186\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.390\nanother page three.\n\n187\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.280\nIf you do collate,\nwe can print it one, two, three, and\n\n188\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.370\nagain the next set one, two, three.\n\n189\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.080\nSo again,\ncollate's just a pre-determined output.\n\n190\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.940\nHow do you want the printed\noutput to be arranged?\n\n191\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.792\nAnd that's pre-determined\nby the collate settings.\n\n192\n00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.000\nOther you have as well is orientation,\nall right?\n\n193\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.560\nOrientation is basically\nthe layout of the print, right?\n\n194\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.840\nThe paper itself, how are gonna print the\ntext or the image within the paper itself?\n\n195\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.080\nYou see that there are two orientations.\n\n196\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.710\nWe have typically what's portrait, right?\n\n197\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.960\nWhich, you think about the 8 by 11\nportrait photo that might be sitting\n\n198\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.355\non your desk, maybe your kids, maybe your\nwife, maybe your dog or your cat, right?\n\n199\n00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:19.470\nMusician.\n\n200\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.650\nVersus landscape.\n\n201\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.175\nLandscape, again, is more a panoramic\nlayout, and these are settings that you\n\n202\n00:10:24.175 --> 00:10:28.580\nconfigure when you connect to the printer,\nand typically pre-printing, right?\n\n203\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.540\nYou can modify these.\n\n204\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.990\nThe other thing we have\nnot only orientation,\n\n205\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.370\nwe have what's known as duplex.\n\n206\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.880\nGuys, don't let Duplex really concern you,\n\n207\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.085\nduplex-\n&gt;&gt; It's a place you live, right?\n\n208\n00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:44.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, it's not a triplex,\n\n209\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.750\nit's a duplex.\n\n210\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.830\nDuplexing just means the ability to print\nto both sides of the paper at one time.\n\n211\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.210\nYou usually have inside of your printers,\nand\n\n212\n00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.190\nwe've got print technologies that we'll\ntalk about a little more specifically,\n\n213\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.950\nthat actually have, basically the ability\nto, sometimes they can do it at one time.\n\n214\n00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.010\nIt goes through a printer and\nit's printing on both sides.\n\n215\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.020\nA lot of times which you have is\nan assembly that flips the paper around in\n\n216\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.220\na way that it prints on one side and then\ncan turn around and print on the other.\n\n217\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.040\nDuplexing just means that we can\nprint two sided printing, right?\n\n218\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.650\nTo both sides of the paper.\n\n219\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.030\nThe other thing is quality.\n\n220\n00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.900\nAnd again, keep in mind,\n\n221\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.400\nquality is just based on what,\nhow clear do you want the output.\n\n222\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.080\nI can actually give you an example here.\n\n223\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.690\nIf I was to, let's say,\npull up one of these notes here,\n\n224\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.080\nand I go to do,\nhere this specific to MAC right?\n\n225\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.700\nWindows you can do this as well.\n\n226\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.430\nNotice that it tells me presets.\n\n227\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.720\nDefault settings right?\n\n228\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.870\nAnd if I choose down it tells me some\nof the things that I can configure.\n\n229\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.140\nI can say, hey, black and white, right?\n\n230\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.430\nBut if there's text,\nI don't really about the color right?\n\n231\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.286\nDan and I just looking at [SOUND] text.\n\n232\n00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.700\nI don't have any color on here,\nI don't have to waste the color.\n\n233\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.330\nColor's expensive, and a lot of times\nyou're talking about the difference\n\n234\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.900\nbetween about $0.05,\n$0.06 a paper versus $0.30, right?\n\n235\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.430\nIt doesn't sounds like a lot, but\nwhen you multiple that times 800,\n\n236\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.930\nyou're talking about,\nit could cost your company a lot of money.\n\n237\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.270\nBut even more so that that,\nnotice I wanna show you the details here.\n\n238\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.660\nNotice some of the things that we can do,\nright?\n\n239\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.320\nWe talked about orientation, right?\n\n240\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.870\nThis is your portrait view\nversus your landscape view, and\n\n241\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.600\nyou can see how it kinda rotates, right?\n\n242\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.870\nWe could say where is the feed from and\nwhat are the media types, too.\n\n243\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.400\nI can also do scaling.\n\n244\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.948\nI can also set what kind of paper\nit's gonna be printed to, and\n\n245\n00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.182\nthat's one of the great things that a lot\nof printers support multiple media.\n\n246\n00:12:23.182 --> 00:12:28.012\nYou could be doing envelopes, you could\nbe letters, if you will, legal letters,\n\n247\n00:12:28.012 --> 00:12:32.844\ncard stock, transparency, some still will\nprint things like transparencies and\n\n248\n00:12:32.844 --> 00:12:35.850\nlabels, and\nyou can always rearrange that, too.\n\n249\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.870\nSo it kinda gives you an idea that\nyou can print these different types.\n\n250\n00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.650\nNow, I also wanna mention, and, Dan,\nI know I'm kind of jumping out an order.\n\n251\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:48.010\nOne of the things that comes up in the\nlast part of the objectives is the ability\n\n252\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.835\nto do what is, and you know what,\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n253\n00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:53.220\nI tell you what, I'm gonna save that for\na later episode.\n\n254\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.730\nI could tell you briefly here, and we'll\nshow you guys this again in one of our\n\n255\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.410\nother printing episodes,\nis that you can also print a PDF.\n\n256\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.970\nAnd PDF, that's the most common format,\nMicrosoft's got one called XPS.\n\n257\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.910\nIt's not as common as PDF, but\nthis is basically a virtual printing.\n\n258\n00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.290\nYou're not actually printing to a printer,\n\n259\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.390\nyou're taking the text on whatever it is\nthat you're looking at, a Word document,\n\n260\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.580\nif you will, and you're outputting\nit to a file essentially.\n\n261\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.972\nAnd we'll talk a little bit\nmore about that coming up, and\n\n262\n00:13:20.972 --> 00:13:24.270\nwe'll also come double back on\nthis iCloud cuz this is kind of a,\n\n263\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.570\nthis is an interesting type\nof printing technology.\n\n264\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.360\nAll right, so that is,\n\n265\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.650\nthose are some of the settings\nthat we want you to be aware of.\n\n266\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.590\nDuplex, collate, orientation, and quality.\n\n267\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.790\nAll right, now the next thing it\ncomes down to is print sharing.\n\n268\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.330\nMore specifically,\nthey call out device sharing.\n\n269\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.150\nAnd ladies and gentlemen,\n\n270\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.090\nthere are all different types\nof methods of device sharing.\n\n271\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.120\nLet's go ahead, what we're going to do is\nwe're gonna run through these kind of one\n\n272\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.890\nat a time and give you an explanation\nof what you might see.\n\n273\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.708\nNow, I'm gonna tell you right now,\nthe last two, kind of outdated.\n\n274\n00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of legacy technology.\n\n275\n00:13:58.628 --> 00:14:02.260\nSerial it's still mentioned,\nit's still mentioned on the exam.\n\n276\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.490\nHowever, it's one of those ones that\nis pretty much gone by the way side,\n\n277\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.180\nall right?\n\n278\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:13.500\nSerial printing is that 9DB connector\nthat you would see and a 15 pin cable or\n\n279\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.360\nanother 15 pin connector if you will that\nplugs into the printer portal as well.\n\n280\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.225\nAgain, represented in your operating\nsystem is com ports as they call them,\n\n281\n00:14:23.225 --> 00:14:24.538\nCOM1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n282\n00:14:24.538 --> 00:14:26.850\nAgain, communication ports.\n\n283\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.660\nParallel ports,\nthese are LPT ports if you will.\n\n284\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.580\nLine, printer, terminal I believe\nis what LPT stands for and\n\n285\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.270\nit would be LPT one, two, three and four.\n\n286\n00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.730\nReally gone by the wayside, right?\n\n287\n00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.100\nWhy has it gone by the wayside?\n\n288\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.120\nWell, one of the big reasons\nis the fact that USB\n\n289\n00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.825\nbecame pretty much the wired standard for\na long time when it comes to printing.\n\n290\n00:14:49.825 --> 00:14:56.160\nAnd when we say wired printing, what we're\ntalking about is a physical connection,\n\n291\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.200\ntypically to the PC that\nyou're printing off of, right?\n\n292\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.870\nSo, when we look at these printing types,\na lot of times what you would have is you\n\n293\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:08.090\nwould have a printer directly connected\nto the PC via an old parallel cable.\n\n294\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:14.020\nI think it was called the IEEE1284 cable\nand it used a 36-pin Centronics cable.\n\n295\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.949\nIt almost looked like the old SCSI\ncables that you would plug into\n\n296\n00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:19.490\nthe back of the printer.\n\n297\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.600\nAnd again, serial printers as well,\nalso wired straight to the PC.\n\n298\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:30.150\nUSB has primarily pretty much signaled the\ndeath blow for those older technologies.\n\n299\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.925\nAnd Dan and I were talking, in the many\neditions of our PC connections,\n\n300\n00:15:34.925 --> 00:15:39.224\nwe talked about the USB B-type\nconnector that really kind of got\n\n301\n00:15:39.224 --> 00:15:43.758\nits name calling it a printer cable,\nif you will, just because, or\n\n302\n00:15:43.758 --> 00:15:46.968\nprinter port,because it\nwas the most common.\n\n303\n00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:49.825\n&gt;&gt; You know, Wes,\none of the ways that most people,\n\n304\n00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:55.018\nthey don't even realize that they've wired\nup their printer Is their ethernet, right?\n\n305\n00:15:55.018 --> 00:15:56.653\nTheir actual network connectivity.\n\n306\n00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:59.581\nThey have a cable running to back of\ntheir computer, it's just not USB or\n\n307\n00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:00.687\nsomething to that effect.\n\n308\n00:16:00.687 --> 00:16:02.070\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct.\n\n309\n00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.640\nIn fact, I said one of the most common for\nthe longest time was USB.\n\n310\n00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.832\nI've got to be careful\nwith that one today.\n\n311\n00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because really one of the most common\n\n312\n00:16:07.682 --> 00:16:10.745\nin today's environment is exactly what\nyou said, that network cable, right?\n\n313\n00:16:10.745 --> 00:16:16.109\nThe ethernet cable, ethernet standard\nRJ45 jack on the back of your printer.\n\n314\n00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:19.822\nNow with these wire connections minus\nthe ethernet cable these earlier wireless\n\n315\n00:16:19.822 --> 00:16:23.261\nconnections what you would have to do is\nyou would have to use the software or\n\n316\n00:16:23.261 --> 00:16:25.464\nthe operating system to\nshare out the printer.\n\n317\n00:16:25.464 --> 00:16:28.324\nAnd people would basically\nbe connecting to your PC and\n\n318\n00:16:28.324 --> 00:16:30.636\nyour PC would be acting\nlike a print server.\n\n319\n00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:33.561\nWe'll talk about an integrated\nprint server here in a second.\n\n320\n00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:37.573\nHowever, keep in mind, ethernet is\nessentially a networking technology, and\n\n321\n00:16:37.573 --> 00:16:40.236\nthis is what we would call\na Network-Based Printer.\n\n322\n00:16:40.236 --> 00:16:43.730\nSo, glad you mentioned that one Dan,\nbecause I certainly didn't have that one\n\n323\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.083\non the list, but we do have it on\nthe objectives, we'll have to call it out.\n\n324\n00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:52.744\nNow, on another note, sometimes you\nhave physical limitations where wired or\n\n325\n00:16:52.744 --> 00:16:56.217\nbounded cables just aren't feasible,\nright?\n\n326\n00:16:56.217 --> 00:17:00.602\nAnd there's many different situations,\nmaybe the location of\n\n327\n00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:05.163\nthe printer is not adequate to have\nsome kind of wired connection.\n\n328\n00:17:05.163 --> 00:17:08.495\n&gt;&gt; Do not run it longer than 16\nfoot USB cable to a printer.\n\n329\n00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.494\n&gt;&gt; Yes that's right.\n&gt;&gt; It won't work.\n\n330\n00:17:09.494 --> 00:17:13.118\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, definitely not.\n\n331\n00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:16.181\nIt might be the fact that wherever\nthe room is,maybe you don't have\n\n332\n00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:18.288\nan ethernet port, maybe you can't connect.\n\n333\n00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:23.298\nYou don't have wiring in that location but\nyou have to put the printer there.\n\n334\n00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:26.318\nSo how are we going to share a device out?\n\n335\n00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:29.103\nAnd that's where some of your\nwireless standards come in and\n\n336\n00:17:29.103 --> 00:17:30.304\nthere is many different,\n\n337\n00:17:30.304 --> 00:17:33.814\nthere's a few different wireless\ntechnologies that we need to be aware of.\n\n338\n00:17:33.814 --> 00:17:35.704\nNow when we talk about wireless,\n\n339\n00:17:35.704 --> 00:17:39.967\nI've got a basically the big three up\nhere that we need to really consider.\n\n340\n00:17:39.967 --> 00:17:43.535\nWiFi itself, that's an 802.11 standard.\n\n341\n00:17:43.535 --> 00:17:49.211\nI will tell you guys that they call\nout the different 802.11 standards,\n\n342\n00:17:49.211 --> 00:17:51.623\n802.11 A, B, G and an AC.\n\n343\n00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:55.865\nGuys, if that's just a whole bunch\nof Algebra there, we have a wireless\n\n344\n00:17:55.865 --> 00:18:00.194\nsection where we really go in to every\none of those individual standards.\n\n345\n00:18:00.194 --> 00:18:02.955\nSo, we're not really gonna\ntalk about them here.\n\n346\n00:18:02.955 --> 00:18:07.641\nHowever, when it comes to your printers\nand the devices that connect to them,\n\n347\n00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:11.131\nbe mindful of your wireless\naccess point within the SOHO.\n\n348\n00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:13.857\nIt has to,\nthe specifications have to match, right?\n\n349\n00:18:13.857 --> 00:18:18.768\nSo if you have an N based access point,\nyou have to have a wireless printer\n\n350\n00:18:18.768 --> 00:18:23.454\nthat supports either the B, or the G,\nor even A standard if you will.\n\n351\n00:18:23.454 --> 00:18:27.484\nSo definitely watch the compatibility,\nmake sure that you have devices\n\n352\n00:18:27.484 --> 00:18:32.043\nthat can also connect to the wireless\nnetwork over the same wireless technology,\n\n353\n00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:33.047\nit is important.\n\n354\n00:18:33.047 --> 00:18:34.761\nIn other episodes,\nwe talked about bluetooth.\n\n355\n00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:38.421\nBluetooth being one of the PC connections\nthat you can implement today.\n\n356\n00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:43.346\nOne of the great things about bluetooth\nis that it is a less complex set-up\n\n357\n00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.306\nthan WiFi is.\n\n358\n00:18:44.306 --> 00:18:47.474\nWiFi does require you joining\nthe device to the network.\n\n359\n00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:51.656\nIt requires the network-based devices\nto actually have a certain amount of\n\n360\n00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:54.282\nconfiguration to be able to connect and\nprint.\n\n361\n00:18:54.282 --> 00:18:56.934\nBluetooth is really nice because\nit goes through a pairing process.\n\n362\n00:18:56.934 --> 00:18:59.621\nYou turn the Bluetooth communication on,\non the wireless printer.\n\n363\n00:18:59.621 --> 00:19:02.000\nYou turn your Bluetooth\n[LAUGH] technology on,\n\n364\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.562\non whatever the device it\nis you're printing to.\n\n365\n00:19:04.562 --> 00:19:08.137\nIncluding things like mobile devices which\nmakes it even more convenient today,\n\n366\n00:19:08.137 --> 00:19:10.883\nbecause the prevalence of mobile\ndevices and the necessity for\n\n367\n00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.300\nmobility within your network.\n\n368\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.217\nSo it makes it really really great.\n\n369\n00:19:14.217 --> 00:19:15.733\nThere's also Near Field Communication.\n\n370\n00:19:15.733 --> 00:19:18.356\nThat's kinda cool technology\nwhere if your printer and\n\n371\n00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:20.701\nyour devices support\nNear Field Communication,\n\n372\n00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:24.073\nyou can actually get within just\na couple of centimeters of the device.\n\n373\n00:19:24.073 --> 00:19:26.795\nOr inches if you will depending\nupon which system you use and\n\n374\n00:19:26.795 --> 00:19:29.898\nyou can actually touch the device\nto the printer itself, the things\n\n375\n00:19:29.898 --> 00:19:33.565\nlike NFC tags and you can transfer the\ndata files right to the printer directly.\n\n376\n00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:36.860\nSo really, really cool technology.\n\n377\n00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.092\nSo when we talk about these\nwhat are the things that,\n\n378\n00:19:39.092 --> 00:19:40.581\nwhat are the benefits if you will?\n\n379\n00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:44.067\nThat's a little bit about the technology\nwhat technology we would use,\n\n380\n00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:45.791\nwhy would we use wireless, right?\n\n381\n00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:47.174\nReduce cabling costs, right?\n\n382\n00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:49.732\nCabling is expensive.\n\n383\n00:19:49.732 --> 00:19:52.621\nBetter cable management,\nbecause the lack thereof, right?\n\n384\n00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's really easy to manage no\n\n385\n00:19:55.097 --> 00:19:55.887\ncables, right?\n\n386\n00:19:55.887 --> 00:19:56.836\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n387\n00:19:56.836 --> 00:19:57.980\nyou don't have all the rats nests.\n\n388\n00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.515\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n389\n00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:01.997\n&gt;&gt; I think about having a printer and\nall those other things that are connected\n\n390\n00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:05.102\nto the back of the computer, so,\nagain, good cable management.\n\n391\n00:20:05.102 --> 00:20:08.262\nWe talked about overcoming some of the\nphysical limitations that you might have,\n\n392\n00:20:08.262 --> 00:20:09.470\nstructural limitations too.\n\n393\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.250\nMaybe you don't have, maybe you're on\na building that you can't just knock holes\n\n394\n00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.926\nin the walls to run physical cables.\n\n395\n00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:20.168\nMaybe you're working for or working in the\nbuilding that's got some kinda historical\n\n396\n00:20:20.168 --> 00:20:24.715\nvalue and you say sorry this is\na historical building, a historical site.\n\n397\n00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:29.912\nYou can't just knock walls down and\nstart doing cabling.\n\n398\n00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:32.435\nWe talked about printer positioning,\nthat's something too.\n\n399\n00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:36.664\nIt gets a little bit more convenient\nwhen you have a wireless network,\n\n400\n00:20:36.664 --> 00:20:38.394\nall you need is an AC source.\n\n401\n00:20:38.394 --> 00:20:41.243\nTypically you'd need some kind of socket.\n\n402\n00:20:41.243 --> 00:20:44.004\nOne of the great things too is you\ncan implement things like range\n\n403\n00:20:44.004 --> 00:20:44.938\nextenders, right?\n\n404\n00:20:44.938 --> 00:20:48.848\nI can't get out the blue handled\nCAT cable stretcher, right?\n\n405\n00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:49.787\nIt's not really going to work.\n\n406\n00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:51.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; We can't stretch those cables,\n\n407\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.573\nwell we can, but they're not\ngonna work too well after that.\n\n408\n00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:55.005\nYou get wireless range extenders, right?\n\n409\n00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:58.868\nSo that's the benefit,\nanother one of those benefits.\n\n410\n00:20:58.868 --> 00:21:00.637\nAgain we talked about bluetooth,\n\n411\n00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:03.448\nagain bluetooth reduces\nthe complexity of the setup.\n\n412\n00:21:03.448 --> 00:21:06.562\nI've already mentioned pay attention\nto the compatibility when it comes to\n\n413\n00:21:06.562 --> 00:21:07.788\nthe 802.11 standard.\n\n414\n00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:12.473\nOne of the great things too when we talk\nabout well why would WiFi be beneficial?\n\n415\n00:21:12.473 --> 00:21:14.386\nWell, maybe your device\ndoesn't support Bluetooth.\n\n416\n00:21:14.386 --> 00:21:18.511\nI mean that's not really,\nthat's kinda uncommon,\n\n417\n00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:21.362\nwhen you talk about mobile devices.\n\n418\n00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:24.536\nBut maybe you have a laptop that doesn't\nsupport bluetooth for whatever reason.\n\n419\n00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:25.690\nThe other ability too,\n\n420\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.268\nof WiFi is that fact that you can get\noff on the industrial, scientific and\n\n421\n00:21:29.268 --> 00:21:33.022\nmedical band that sits within the 2.4\ngigahertz frequency and move over to\n\n422\n00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:36.973\nthe relatively unused, I think it's\nuniband 5 gigahertz frequency, right?\n\n423\n00:21:36.973 --> 00:21:40.981\nSo, again, you get better bandwidth and-\n&gt;&gt; Bluetooth has a shorter range,\n\n424\n00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:41.697\nas well, right?\n\n425\n00:21:41.697 --> 00:21:43.047\nSo you get more range with wifi.\n\n426\n00:21:43.047 --> 00:21:46.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point too,\nand not to mention, on top of it,\n\n427\n00:21:46.702 --> 00:21:48.642\nrange extenders on top of that too.\n\n428\n00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:50.803\nSo if I have multiple buildings, right?\n\n429\n00:21:50.803 --> 00:21:55.124\nWe can use additional technologies to\nextend the range of being able to print to\n\n430\n00:21:55.124 --> 00:21:55.919\nthe printer.\n\n431\n00:21:55.919 --> 00:22:01.368\nSo a lot of good things when it\ncomes to implementing wireless.\n\n432\n00:22:01.368 --> 00:22:04.634\nNow, there are some other technologies\nDan that I kinda wanna talk about here\n\n433\n00:22:04.634 --> 00:22:05.396\nreally briefly.\n\n434\n00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:08.623\nAnd I kinda know I'm kinda jumping around\nhere in my notes but let's go ahead and\n\n435\n00:22:08.623 --> 00:22:10.711\ntalk about the additional\nnetwork technologies.\n\n436\n00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:14.943\nThere are things out there like for\ninstance TCP they call out.\n\n437\n00:22:14.943 --> 00:22:19.854\nThey call out things like Bonjour,\nAirPrint, if you will.\n\n438\n00:22:19.854 --> 00:22:20.684\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n439\n00:22:20.684 --> 00:22:23.279\ntake look at this, let's look at\nsome of these other technology.\n\n440\n00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:26.906\nSo TCP/IP based printing again is\nrelative to what Dan was saying.\n\n441\n00:22:26.906 --> 00:22:29.475\nWe talk about things like\nour ethernet port right?\n\n442\n00:22:29.475 --> 00:22:32.035\nWe plug in, in a lot times,\nto be able to find and\n\n443\n00:22:32.035 --> 00:22:36.071\nlocate these network-based printers\nthat are wired, or even wireless,\n\n444\n00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:40.704\nyou're gonna use a TCP/IP protocol stack,\nit's typically gonna be an IP address.\n\n445\n00:22:40.704 --> 00:22:44.295\nThere are other ways that you can\nlocate these printers, too, with URLs,\n\n446\n00:22:44.295 --> 00:22:47.897\nif you will, that Uniform Resource Locator\nwhich Just like a web address.\n\n447\n00:22:47.897 --> 00:22:51.465\nBonjour itself,\nBonjour's a really cool technology,\n\n448\n00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:56.010\nbecause we talked about things like,\nfor instance, drivers, right?\n\n449\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.116\nAnd services.\n\n450\n00:22:57.116 --> 00:23:01.304\nWell, one of the good things about Bonjour\nis it really minimizes, if you will,\n\n451\n00:23:01.304 --> 00:23:02.421\nthe configuration.\n\n452\n00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:05.762\nAnd this is something we use inside\nof Mac based products, if you will,\n\n453\n00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:09.774\nthat allows the communication between\nnetwork connected devices, applications,\n\n454\n00:23:09.774 --> 00:23:10.512\nand services.\n\n455\n00:23:10.512 --> 00:23:13.953\nAnd it allows us zero\nconfig based technology,\n\n456\n00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:19.645\nzero config is zero configuration if\nyou will, so another great technology.\n\n457\n00:23:19.645 --> 00:23:21.713\nAnd associated with that too is AirPrint,\nright?\n\n458\n00:23:21.713 --> 00:23:26.323\niOS devices,\nMac OS devices printing wirelessly via\n\n459\n00:23:26.323 --> 00:23:30.122\nthe LAN without the necessity for\na driver.\n\n460\n00:23:30.122 --> 00:23:31.712\nThat's gonna save you some time, right?\n\n461\n00:23:31.712 --> 00:23:34.235\nThat's what we use here on our Macs,\nAirPrint.\n\n462\n00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:34.772\nIn fact,\n\n463\n00:23:34.772 --> 00:23:39.558\nyou know what, let's go ahead while I've\ngot this up here, let's do a print here.\n\n464\n00:23:39.558 --> 00:23:45.057\nLet me find,\nlet's open up Haroopad, right?\n\n465\n00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:48.687\nAll of these printers that you see\nhere are actually being found by\n\n466\n00:23:48.687 --> 00:23:49.812\nAirPrint, right?\n\n467\n00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:53.218\nI believe we can see this.\n\n468\n00:23:53.218 --> 00:23:54.925\nDown here I believe?\n\n469\n00:23:54.925 --> 00:24:00.570\nMaybe its not in here, but\nthese are your airprint based printers.\n\n470\n00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.602\nIf we want to find a printer, it'll go\nthrough the process of communicating\n\n471\n00:24:04.602 --> 00:24:07.880\nacross the network and\nit will add these printers to the list.\n\n472\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.403\nSo great thing to have there\nwith something like AirPrint.\n\n473\n00:24:12.403 --> 00:24:16.626\nSo technology that they definitely call\nout, let's see if I can cancel that and\n\n474\n00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:17.769\nget back out of here.\n\n475\n00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.340\nAnd so definitely be aware of that for\nthe exam.\n\n476\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:27.171\nThe other thing I want you to keep in mind\nthat when we talk about different printing\n\n477\n00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:31.090\nprotocols out there you have what\nare known as integrated print servers.\n\n478\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.560\nAll right integrated print server\nbasically is a device that\n\n479\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.210\ncentralizes the management of printing.\n\n480\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.617\nAnd we can have multiple devices that are\nprinting to a network printer, right, and\n\n481\n00:24:41.617 --> 00:24:44.046\nwhat happens is that you\nend up having a queue.\n\n482\n00:24:44.046 --> 00:24:49.097\nAnd a queue is the print job, essentially\nwhat you're print that's stored in memory.\n\n483\n00:24:49.097 --> 00:24:52.774\nAnd if everybody's printing any time they\nwant, well, it can become a little bit\n\n484\n00:24:52.774 --> 00:24:56.690\nconvoluted when it comes to the whole, you\nknow, management of that printer itself.\n\n485\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.588\nSo if you have an integrated print server,\nwhat you can do is centrally manage of all\n\n486\n00:25:00.588 --> 00:25:04.059\nof the print jobs, the print queue,\ndriver management is centralized.\n\n487\n00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:08.568\nCentralized administration brings us\nmore of a least administrative effort.\n\n488\n00:25:08.568 --> 00:25:13.960\nPrint permissions, print times,\ntime of day printing.\n\n489\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.310\nYou're reducing the amount of\npages that can be printed out.\n\n490\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.200\nIf you want to control\nthings like black and white,\n\n491\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.600\nbecause we don't want the company to get\ncharged more money because people are,\n\n492\n00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.322\njust printed an 800 page color\ndocument that basically drains all of\n\n493\n00:25:28.322 --> 00:25:34.270\nthe ink if you will or whatever,\nif it's laser or toner that you're using.\n\n494\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.503\n&gt;&gt; Listen I downloaded a PDF book and\nI needed to print it out.\n\n495\n00:25:37.503 --> 00:25:38.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n496\n00:25:38.314 --> 00:25:38.847\n&gt;&gt; What is the problem?\n\n497\n00:25:38.847 --> 00:25:39.651\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That will just be between\n\n498\n00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:40.151\nme, you and Facebook.\n\n499\n00:25:40.151 --> 00:25:41.347\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n500\n00:25:41.347 --> 00:25:44.266\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So again, it can, one of the things to\n\n501\n00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:48.871\nkeep in mind though is that a lot of your\ndevices, if they do have integrated print\n\n502\n00:25:48.871 --> 00:25:53.030\nserver, it could be built right into\nthe network based printer itself.\n\n503\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.880\nIt's really about\nmanaging the print queue,\n\n504\n00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.787\nthat's one of the great\nthings that you can do.\n\n505\n00:25:56.787 --> 00:25:59.223\nSome of the protocols I've\nactually got in the list here and\n\n506\n00:25:59.223 --> 00:26:01.960\nsome of the protocols that you can\nsee that are used inside of this.\n\n507\n00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.904\nYou got for instance MNP, excuse me,\nif I could say that right.\n\n508\n00:26:05.904 --> 00:26:06.427\n&gt;&gt; LMNOP?\n\n509\n00:26:06.427 --> 00:26:07.891\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n510\n00:26:07.891 --> 00:26:11.760\nthat's Microsoft's network\nprinting protocol.\n\n511\n00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.190\nIPP, if you will,\nis the internet printing protocol.\n\n512\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.160\nAnd the last one is common in your nix\nbased systems, Unix, Linux, if you will.\n\n513\n00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.560\nThat is the line printer daemon and\n\n514\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.120\nit is a common protocol for\nprinting across the network.\n\n515\n00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.740\nNow some of the other last things\n\n516\n00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:33.530\nthat we wanna talk about is a cloud\nbased printing or remote printing.\n\n517\n00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.000\nAnd there are technologies out\nthere that allow us to do that.\n\n518\n00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.552\nOne of the ones they specifically\ncall out when they say the cloud and\n\n519\n00:26:40.552 --> 00:26:43.557\nremote printing is what's\nknown as Google Cloud print.\n\n520\n00:26:43.557 --> 00:26:46.848\nI want you to think of\nthis as a cloud service,\n\n521\n00:26:46.848 --> 00:26:49.456\nis a software is a service, right?\n\n522\n00:26:49.456 --> 00:26:54.063\nAnd basically being able to send\ninformation up to the Cloud,\n\n523\n00:26:54.063 --> 00:26:56.642\nif you will and print to a printer.\n\n524\n00:26:56.642 --> 00:26:59.870\nThere a lot of printers out there\nthat support Google Cloud Print.\n\n525\n00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.852\nIt basically means that they're\ngonna manage your print job for you.\n\n526\n00:27:03.852 --> 00:27:08.634\nI think it's Hewlett Packard I believe\nthat is their equivalent to it is\n\n527\n00:27:08.634 --> 00:27:09.761\ncalled ePrint.\n\n528\n00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:13.362\nSo this is again cloud based printing, in\na way to connect your printer from home or\n\n529\n00:27:13.362 --> 00:27:14.680\nwork to the cloud if you will.\n\n530\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.030\nThe ability to print\nacross multiple devices.\n\n531\n00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.460\nI have a mobile phone, maybe I'm not\nconnected to the wireless network, but\n\n532\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.620\nI really have to print this job.\n\n533\n00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.116\nWell, I could send it up to the cloud and\nthey,\n\n534\n00:27:25.116 --> 00:27:28.384\naccording to if you have\na cloud-based printing solution,\n\n535\n00:27:28.384 --> 00:27:32.625\nyour printer has that functionality\nbuilt into it, you do have that ability.\n\n536\n00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:35.974\nOne of the great things about cloud-based\nprinting is the fact that it eliminates\n\n537\n00:27:35.974 --> 00:27:38.360\nthe necessity for driver management, why?\n\n538\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.970\nBecause you're sending it to the Cloud and\n\n539\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.700\nthey managed the drivers\nin the background.\n\n540\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.310\nSo the responsibility to manage the\nphysical printer by itself can essentially\n\n541\n00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:51.720\nbe allocated to a third party, some kind\nof professional cloud-based solution.\n\n542\n00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.000\nIt reduces things like device\ncompatibility issues and\n\n543\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.220\nthe other thing that you also\nget is access on demand.\n\n544\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.360\nAll right Dan we made it almost to the end\nof the episode we do have one more\n\n545\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.110\nthing when it comes to\nthe considerations of printing and\n\n546\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.830\nthat has to deal with data privacy.\n\n547\n00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.620\nAll right you have to be very careful\nbecause if people can print to printers\n\n548\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.750\nany time they want you might end up\n\n549\n00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.330\nlosing things like user\nauthentication on the device itself.\n\n550\n00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.820\nAgain this could cause problems,\nespecially if you're in an environment\n\n551\n00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.798\nwhere maybe you're handling\ncredit card payment information.\n\n552\n00:28:25.798 --> 00:28:28.534\nIn the security world\nthey call that PCIDSS,\n\n553\n00:28:28.534 --> 00:28:31.705\npayment card information\ndata security standard.\n\n554\n00:28:31.705 --> 00:28:34.959\nAnd if you don't have authentication\nthat might violate some kind of standard\n\n555\n00:28:34.959 --> 00:28:35.800\nlike that.\n\n556\n00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.090\nThe other thing I want you to think of\nthat they call out on the exam, and\n\n557\n00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.330\nthis is something that's very important,\nis hard drive caching.\n\n558\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.981\nYour network based printers\nare really self contained computers,\n\n559\n00:28:44.981 --> 00:28:46.782\namongst being a printer as well.\n\n560\n00:28:46.782 --> 00:28:49.801\nAnd if I'm caching that information,\n\n561\n00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:54.655\nthen there's the ability to pull\nthat data out of the printer.\n\n562\n00:28:54.655 --> 00:28:57.480\nYou have a print job,\nyou essentially send it to the printer.\n\n563\n00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.845\nThe print job stays in a volatile\nmemory region called the queue, but\n\n564\n00:29:00.845 --> 00:29:03.977\nto make sure that if the printer fails or\nthe printer shuts down,\n\n565\n00:29:03.977 --> 00:29:06.607\nit's written to the hard drive,\nwell, guess what?\n\n566\n00:29:06.607 --> 00:29:09.798\nAnytime something's written to the hard\ndrive it means you can do data recovery\n\n567\n00:29:09.798 --> 00:29:10.770\non it later.\n\n568\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.188\nThis could be a security problem, so\n\n569\n00:29:13.188 --> 00:29:16.629\ndo keep that in mind when\nwe talk about data privacy.\n\n570\n00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:20.597\nIf you are in a company that details with\ncredit cards, that deals with PII or\n\n571\n00:29:20.597 --> 00:29:24.135\n[CROSSTALK] Personal Identifiable\nInformation, thank you there.\n\n572\n00:29:24.135 --> 00:29:26.968\nPHI, Protected Healthcare Information,\njust turn around and\n\n573\n00:29:26.968 --> 00:29:29.700\nthis could be a violation\nof your security policy.\n\n574\n00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.040\nAgain the formal statement on what\nsecurity means to your company.\n\n575\n00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.030\nSo definitely keep those in mind but\n\n576\n00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.340\nreally like things like airprint because\nit makes driver management so simple.\n\n577\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.310\nGoogle Cloud print is another one\nof those ones what we can say okay\n\n578\n00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.660\nyou guys go ahead and\nhandle the drives in the background and\n\n579\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.820\nall I have to worry about is what\nprinter did I just send that to?\n\n580\n00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you feel like this was\na bit of a torrent, a flood as it were,\n\n581\n00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.960\nof information when it comes to printers,\nwell guess what,\n\n582\n00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.580\nwe haven't even really\nscratched the surface.\n\n583\n00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.730\nWe've just gotten started.\n\n584\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.380\nI know that down the road we're\ngonna have plenty more to talk about\n\n585\n00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.000\nwhen it comes to printers, but\nthis was a really good primer,\n\n586\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.220\nunderstanding what print devices we have,\nmultifunction devices.\n\n587\n00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.030\nHow they operate,\n\n588\n00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.310\nhow we connect to them is definitely\ngreat stuff that we need to know about.\n\n589\n00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.460\nWes, you did a fantastic\njob of showing us that.\n\n590\n00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.180\nWe do appreciate it,\nwe do appreciate you good folks watching,\n\n591\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.140\nbut looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n592\n00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.200\nSo thanks for that anyway,\n\n593\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.980\nsigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n594\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.845\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n595\n00:30:23.845 --> 00:30:24.987\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n596\n00:30:26.288 -->

00:00:10.793\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:13.302\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:17.350\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.056\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:22.850\nAnd In this episode we're moving forward\nwith more in our A+ 22901 series and\n\n8\n00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.520\njoining us back in the studio again today\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Hey man.\n&gt;&gt; My man.\n\n10\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.198\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:30.158\n&gt;&gt; It's going good man.\n\n12\n00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:30.816\n&gt;&gt; My man.\n\n13\n00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:32.206\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:37.120\nWe are going to be moving\non in printer technologies.\n\n15\n00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.639\nNow I do want you to understand that we've\nalready had one episode that is based on\n\n16\n00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:44.030\nsome printing technologies that are more\nspecific to the SOHO environment.\n\n17\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.515\nBut now what we are gonna do is\nwe're gonna just step back and\n\n18\n00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:49.540\nlook at the different various\ntypes of printers, if you will.\n\n19\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.855\nAnd some of the components and\n\n20\n00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.546\ncharacteristics associated with them that\nyou could potentially see on the exam.\n\n21\n00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:57.940\nAnd that is essentially what\nwe're gonna look at comparing.\n\n22\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.158\n&gt;&gt; Should we go ahead and\nget a crisis counselor on the line?\n\n23\n00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:00.789\nBecause-\n&gt;&gt; I'd probably-\n\n24\n00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:01.387\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is a lot of\n\n25\n00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:02.097\ninformation, right?\n\n26\n00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:03.542\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would just say at the end of\n\n27\n00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.847\nthis episode, it'll be good for\ntwo or three years of therapy.\n\n28\n00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:10.658\n[CROSSTALK] One of the things that I've\nsaid in the past is I could always show\n\n29\n00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:14.187\nyou a printer repair kit and\nit starts with Louie and ends with Ville.\n\n30\n00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:17.752\nAnd some of you guys have probably seen\na movie out there where they repair\n\n31\n00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:20.635\na printer that way, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They fixed it real good.\n\n32\n00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right they fixed it real\n\n33\n00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.798\ngood and so that's what we're\ngonna be looking at today.\n\n34\n00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:28.795\nMore officially where it's compare and\ncontrast the differences between various\n\n35\n00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.290\nprint technologies, and the imaging\nprocesses associated with them.\n\n36\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.255\nAnd we say imaging process, how do we\ntake the data that's in our computers or\n\n37\n00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:40.100\nin our mobile devices today, we're\nnot just limited to PCs, if you will.\n\n38\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.786\nAnd we take that text that we see,\nthe image, if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:46.920\ncould be some kind of photograph as well.\n\n40\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.260\nAnd then we have some kind of output,\nright?\n\n41\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.420\nThat's something that's going\nto be definitely important here.\n\n42\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.500\nSo we're going to dive right in.\n\n43\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.394\nNow, you will see that there are various\nprinter technologies they call out on\n\n44\n00:01:58.394 --> 00:01:58.928\nthe exam.\n\n45\n00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:01.530\nLet's kind of do a high level\noverview here real quick.\n\n46\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.796\nThey call the laser printer out,\nthey call the ink jet printer,\n\n47\n00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:07.654\nthey call the thermal printer,\nand an impact printer.\n\n48\n00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:10.890\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\ntackle each one of these individually.\n\n49\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.786\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna do this,\n\n50\n00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:15.413\na little bit out of order than\nfrom you might see the objectives,\n\n51\n00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:18.546\nwe're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\ntalk about the thermal printer first.\n\n52\n00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:21.653\nI got a little, little,\nkind of makeshift diagram, if you will,\n\n53\n00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:25.440\nof a a thermal, what will the internal\ncomponents of the thermal printer.\n\n54\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.240\nYou have probably seen these before and\nmaybe you didn't even realize.\n\n55\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.290\nIf you've got a printed\nreceipt in your pocket.\n\n56\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.549\nIf you've got a printed receipt for\nsomething that you've bought a purchase\n\n57\n00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.808\nand it's sitting in an envelope somewhere\njust in case you have to return it to\n\n58\n00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:43.110\nthe manufacturer, then you have\nseen some form of thermal printer.\n\n59\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.560\nA thermal printer essentially is\na printer, that like the name implies,\n\n60\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.745\napplies some kind of heat to the media\nto give you the printed output.\n\n61\n00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:53.029\nTypically what you have is,\n\n62\n00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.030\nyou have a few different things\nin your thermal printers, right.\n\n63\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.773\nYou have what's known as a feed assembly,\nand\n\n64\n00:02:57.773 --> 00:02:59.883\na feed assembly is pretty\nmuch in every single printer.\n\n65\n00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:03.705\nIt's what pulls the media\ninto the printer itself.\n\n66\n00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:06.135\nAnd then what you have is what's\nknown as a heating element.\n\n67\n00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:07.935\nAll right, and\nyou've got a few different types.\n\n68\n00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:12.793\nYou have thermal dye transfer\ntype printers, if you will,\n\n69\n00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:16.496\nthat uses kind of like a ribbon,\nif you will.\n\n70\n00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:21.870\nAnd it presses the ribbon down and\nit melts it, and it transfers the media or\n\n71\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.202\nthe, I guess you would say, the component,\nthe inking type component Into the media.\n\n72\n00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:31.415\nOne of the most common ones that\nwe have was what's known as\n\n73\n00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:32.960\na direct thermal printer.\n\n74\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.934\nNow a direct thermal printer is the one\nthat uses a series of heated pins, right.\n\n75\n00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:40.176\nYou have a heating element, and that\nheating element comes down with a series\n\n76\n00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:44.295\nof pins, heats up the paper and\nthe paper is, it's thermally reactive.\n\n77\n00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:47.525\nAnd that's one of the things to keep in\nmind that a thermal printer has a special\n\n78\n00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:48.885\ntype of paper, right?\n\n79\n00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:53.435\nIt's not just your average, I guess\nyou'd say the white inkjet paper that\n\n80\n00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:57.715\nyou see in these big old blocks inside or\nsome office supply store.\n\n81\n00:03:57.715 --> 00:04:02.900\nAnd that's again because that media,\nit actually reacts to the heat.\n\n82\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.611\nNow, I want you to understand that for\nthe most part, we've, for\n\n83\n00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.140\na long time, we've really only\nhad one type of color, right?\n\n84\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.430\nOr, I say one type of color, but\nthat's in an individual printer.\n\n85\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.840\nIt could be black,\ncould be blue if you will.\n\n86\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.735\nHowever, they have thermal printers that\nactually do a form of multicolor printing.\n\n87\n00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:24.554\nAnd what's interesting is that the paper\nreacts with a different color based on\n\n88\n00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:28.318\nthe different temperature settings,\nright, which is kind of interesting.\n\n89\n00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:32.297\n&gt;&gt; That's like when you titanium,\nthe more heat or less heat or\n\n90\n00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:36.163\namount of heat it will change it it has\nquite a big color spectrum actually.\n\n91\n00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:38.461\n&gt;&gt; You know that's actually interesting\nthat you said that cuz I know you and\n\n92\n00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:40.927\nI like and I never would have thought\nabout that it's a great analogy.\n\n93\n00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:43.519\nAnd that's what it is,\nit reacts to you know,\n\n94\n00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.850\nit produces different colors\nat different temperatures.\n\n95\n00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.360\nTypically what you see is black but\n\n96\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.320\nyou could also see blue and even in\nsome portions you might even see red.\n\n97\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.866\nNow, you might want to keep in mind that\nif you are keeping a receipt that has\n\n98\n00:04:56.866 --> 00:05:01.332\nthermo paper in it, it might be a good\ntime to break out your photo copier.\n\n99\n00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:05.626\nAnd make a copy of that receipt and let me\ntell you why, again the paper itself is\n\n100\n00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:09.870\nthermally reactive and it also will\nreturn itself to it's original state.\n\n101\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.890\nThat's why you see those receipts,\nfade over time.\n\n102\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.220\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n103\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.460\nAgain keep in mind it is\na special type of paper.\n\n104\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.510\nYou don't just get any\ntype of white paper and\n\n105\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.650\nthrow it in there because\nit just won't work.\n\n106\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.400\nNot that being said, looking at\nthings like again the feed assembly.\n\n107\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.780\nAnd the heating element if you will, also\nkeep in mind that sometimes the heating\n\n108\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.061\nelement can get a little bit corroded and\nit could be just something as simple as\n\n109\n00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:37.470\nopening it up and\njust brushing off the heating element.\n\n110\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.959\nIt might be something where you\nactually have to replace and\n\n111\n00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.670\na lot of times they're under warranty.\n\n112\n00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.850\nYou have some kind of point of sale\nsystem where you see receipts and stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.570\nA lot of times you'll have company that\nactually does the servicing of these\n\n114\n00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.460\ndevices as well.\n\n115\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.410\nAnd even sometimes it's integrated into\noverall point of sale system that brings\n\n116\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.470\nus to our next type of printer, and\nour next printer is a laser printer.\n\n117\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.790\nAnd a laser printer is a very\ncomplex machine, it really is.\n\n118\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.228\nAnd it has a lot of\ndifferent moving parts.\n\n119\n00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:08.070\nJust well every printer does, but\nthis definitely has a lot of moving parts.\n\n120\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.030\nAnd it's got a very interesting\nprint process that you need\n\n121\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.750\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n122\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.300\nBut let's go ahead and let's take a little\nbit of time and let's kinda go over\n\n123\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.410\nthe different components that you\nsee inside of a laser printer.\n\n124\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.920\nAll right,\nwe look inside of a laser printer,\n\n125\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.430\nyou have what's known as an imaging drum.\n\n126\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.130\nAnd now I'm gonna use some\ninterchangeable terms here,\n\n127\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.570\nbecause the exam objectives\nare very specific.\n\n128\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.380\nHowever, some of the terms that\nyou hear out there might not be as\n\n129\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.640\nspecific as the exam is.\n\n130\n00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.585\nAll right, so they call it an imaging\ndrum and that's exactly what it is.\n\n131\n00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:41.853\nBut you also might hear\nit called an EP Drum, and\n\n132\n00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:44.530\nthat's an electrostatic\nphoto receptor drum.\n\n133\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.810\nNow, wow, doesn't that say this is\nan electrical engineering class, guys.\n\n134\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.930\nBut understand when we say electrostatic\nphoto receptor drum, EP drum,\n\n135\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.300\nwhat we're saying is that it reacts to\na couple different things, electrostatic.\n\n136\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.753\nIt reacts to an electric charge,\nphotoreceptor.\n\n137\n00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:06.270\nIt reacts to light, so both an electrical\ncurrent and light also affect it.\n\n138\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.370\nNow that photoreceptor, if you will,\nis actually a laser, right.\n\n139\n00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.680\nWe call it a laser printer for a reason,\nright, it's actually using a laser.\n\n140\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.120\nDon't let that term fool you.\n\n141\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.830\nYou hear imaging drum on the exam.\n\n142\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.420\nIt's the same thing that if you're\nstudying out there you hear EP drum,\n\n143\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.970\nelectrostatic photo receptor.\n\n144\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.770\nI've also heard it called\nphotographic drum.\n\n145\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.830\nWe're not pulling semantics on you here.\n\n146\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.100\nJust the fact that you might hear one or\ntwo terms.\n\n147\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.660\nThe next thing that you have you could see\nas this print process goes you have what\n\n148\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.690\nis known as the laser itself,\nor the laser unit.\n\n149\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.969\nAnd what is does is it responds,\nthere's other components in here that,\n\n150\n00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:46.259\nthey don't really call out but I wanna\nkind of make mention of it anyways.\n\n151\n00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.535\nYou might say just off to\nthe side of this laser printer\n\n152\n00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.176\nbe a little processing board.\n\n153\n00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:55.445\nThat processing board is just a logic\nboard that actually accepts the commands\n\n154\n00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:56.164\nfrom the pc.\n\n155\n00:07:56.164 --> 00:08:01.110\nAnd then converts it into something that\nthe essentially the laser can react to and\n\n156\n00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.475\nwhat the laser reacts to essentially,\n\n157\n00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:06.720\nI'm printing text right on\nthe screen as we see it.\n\n158\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.220\nIt actually shines the laser against\nwhat's known as a scanning mirror.\n\n159\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.680\nI want you to think of\nthis in your mindset,\n\n160\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.050\nif you remember the old disco balls.\n\n161\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:20.210\nAnd it basically, it directs the laser\nthat reflects that down to the EP drum.\n\n162\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.410\n&gt;&gt; You ever see the movie\nthe Manhattan Project?\n\n163\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes\n&gt;&gt; John Lithgow right?\n\n164\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.770\nAnd he's, he's positioning the mirror so\nhe can cut through the wall and\n\n165\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.780\nsteal the plutonium that's what I think\nof every time I see this diagram.\n\n166\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.940\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly what this is and\n\n167\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.570\nagain, the scanning mirror\nitself essentially reacts and\n\n168\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:42.350\nit basically points the laser on the drum\nitself and it writes to the drum.\n\n169\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.497\nAnd we'll talk about what process\nis actually happening there and\n\n170\n00:08:45.497 --> 00:08:48.995\nwhere the laser writes to is essentially\ngoing to be your printed output.\n\n171\n00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:51.588\nNow you have a couple other\ndifferent technologies,\n\n172\n00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:53.440\nyou have things like a transfer belt.\n\n173\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.150\nAnd again, a transfer belt is part of\nthe transfer assembly that actually\n\n174\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.500\npulls the paper if you will\nthrough the transfer rollers.\n\n175\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.110\nRight, now the transfer rollers are\ntypically friction based in the fact that\n\n176\n00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.580\nthey press against the paper and\nthey pull the paper into the assembly.\n\n177\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.770\nYou also have what is known\nas a fusing assembly here.\n\n178\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.770\nA fusing assembly is really interesting.\n\n179\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.210\nA fusing assembly is heat.\n\n180\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.078\nIf you have ever gone right over to the\nlaser printer as it is It's putting out\n\n181\n00:09:19.078 --> 00:09:21.992\nand you grab your paper there and\nyou feel that it's hot.\n\n182\n00:09:21.992 --> 00:09:26.088\nWell that's how it is actually adhering\nthe toner which we'll talk about in\n\n183\n00:09:26.088 --> 00:09:27.944\na second, to the printed output,\n\n184\n00:09:27.944 --> 00:09:31.040\nit adheres the printed\noutput to the paper itself.\n\n185\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.110\nNow I mentioned toner, what is toner?\n\n186\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.260\nWell toner, inside of a toner cartridge\nis essentially a fine metallic plastic,\n\n187\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:43.400\nit's got both metal and\nplastic in it based material if you will,\n\n188\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.570\nthat is responsible for\nthe printed output itself.\n\n189\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.650\nIt's essentially what we see\nas the texture of the image.\n\n190\n00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.120\nCouple other things that you also have\nhere, the pickup rollers again, so\n\n191\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.260\nall part of the feed assembly,\nif you will.\n\n192\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:04.120\nIt's pulling the paper in through and\nallowing it to pass through the machine.\n\n193\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.970\nA couple of things that they don't call\nout that I want to kind of mention\n\n194\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.270\nbecause it's nice to know some of the\ndifferent technologies you have in here.\n\n195\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.180\nYou also have what\nare known as corona wires.\n\n196\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.300\nAnd we talk about corona wires again,\n\n197\n00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:22.010\nthis this is a electrostatic\nphotoreceptor drum.\n\n198\n00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.170\nThis is what puts the electrical\ncharge on the drum and\n\n199\n00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.430\nalso neutralizes that electrical charge,\nright?\n\n200\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.500\nThere's corona wires, right?\n\n201\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.730\nSo please keep that in mind.\n\n202\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.800\nThere's a discharge lamp, the discharge\nlamp is an interesting thing cuz\n\n203\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.440\nthat's what helps to\nneutralize the charge.\n\n204\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.325\nLet me back up a second because I did\nmisspeak here, I said the corona wires\n\n205\n00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:44.980\nwere responsible for\nremoving the charge and that is not true.\n\n206\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.840\nThe corona wires charge the drum and\nthey charge the paper.\n\n207\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.260\nThey're responsible for the charging.\n\n208\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.740\nIt's the discharge lamp that neutralizes\nthe drum after the print job, right.\n\n209\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.880\nWe erase the electrical charge so that\nthe next piece of paper can go through.\n\n210\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.670\nSo we need to be careful on that one.\n\n211\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.590\nThe discharge lamp guys, you might not\neven hear it called a discharge lamp.\n\n212\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.420\nThe other thing I've\nalso heared it called.\n\n213\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.250\n&gt;&gt; Heared it called.\n\n214\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.270\n&gt;&gt; I heared it called.\n\n215\n00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.380\nThe other thing that I've heard it called\nis a dtac lamp and again it's responsible\n\n216\n00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.690\nfor removing the strong the electrical\ncharge that is placed on the drum.\n\n217\n00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.130\nThat allows the toner to adhere\n\n218\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.090\nto the drum as it passes\nthrough the toner hopper.\n\n219\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.290\nThe toner hopper is essentially\nwhat holds the toner as well.\n\n220\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.400\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n221\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.490\nThe other thing, too,\n\n222\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.640\nis duplexing assemblies are inside\nof your laser printers as well.\n\n223\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.110\nWe talked about duplexing as\na configuration setting that you can do\n\n224\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.090\ninside of your operating system.\n\n225\n00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.910\nYou're essentially controlling\nthe duplexing assembly.\n\n226\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.900\nOn a duplexing assembly guys, there's\nnothing more than allows you to print\n\n227\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.070\nthe both sides of the media right,\ntwo page front and back printing.\n\n228\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.430\nThe other thing I want you to keep in\nmind, too is that based on the size\n\n229\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.730\nof the EP drum,\nwill tell you how fast the printer is.\n\n230\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.620\nIf you're talking about a standard\nlaser printer that is inside\n\n231\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.080\nof your home environment,\ntypically a smaller EP drum and\n\n232\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.980\nthey don't produce as fast of an output.\n\n233\n00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.760\nAnd that's because if you think\nabout it they have to take multiple\n\n234\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.310\nrevolutions to cover an entire page.\n\n235\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.310\nWhen you talk about industrial\nlevel printing right,\n\n236\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.710\ninside of big companies that\ndo this that's their job.\n\n237\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.660\nWe're talking big EP drums right?\n\n238\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.430\nThey could do one full rotation\nprints an entire paper right?\n\n239\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.940\nSo again as that rotates and\n\n240\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.770\nessentially, the output is a lot faster\nand that is definitely important.\n\n241\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.480\nNow let me make sure I\ndidn't forget anything here.\n\n242\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.600\nLooks like I got everything.\n\n243\n00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.680\nI do want you to keep in mind what\nis known as the imaging process.\n\n244\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.180\nThis is something that is important\ninside of the laser printer.\n\n245\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.100\nAnd they are sometimes mentioned\nin two different ways.\n\n246\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.030\nI'm gonna mention what I want you to know\nfor the exam and how they specify it.\n\n247\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.090\nBut you might hear,\nit called something else as well too.\n\n248\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.860\nSo we're gonna do both, all right.\n\n249\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.200\nNow, when we talk about the print process,\n\n250\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.012\nI'm gonna give you the CompTIA model,\njust the terminology and\n\n251\n00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:03.300\nthen other terminology that you'll\nhear out there as well, processing.\n\n252\n00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.520\nAll right, CompTIA, and\nit's processing regardless.\n\n253\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.850\nProcessing is the actual computer\nprocessing the information or\n\n254\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.870\nsending the information to that processing\nboard that's in the printer itself,\n\n255\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.510\nthat basically interprets what your\ncomputer is telling it to do, right.\n\n256\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.509\nAnd it's essentially what is\ngoing to direct the laser.\n\n257\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.240\nNow in no real specific order here\n\n258\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.720\nI want you to keep in mind that this\nprocess is constantly happening all right?\n\n259\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.740\nSo this is a very rotational thing.\n\n260\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.790\nAll right cleaning you could consider\nit cleaning being the beginning.\n\n261\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.050\nYou could see it considered the end.\n\n262\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.150\nI mean what you're doing is\nyou're preparing the drum for\n\n263\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.820\nthe next paper that's coming through.\n\n264\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.250\nDo you consider that the beginning\nof the processing cycle, or\n\n265\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.720\ndo you consider it the end?\n\n266\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.270\nIt is not something that you\nhave to worry about on the exam.\n\n267\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:50.770\nCleaning.\n\n268\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.490\nWhen we talk about cleaning,\nwhat is happening?\n\n269\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:58.870\nYou do have a small little squeegee\nthat sits on the EP drum itself,\n\n270\n00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.250\nand any residual toner that's left over,\nit scrapes off.\n\n271\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.470\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that\ndischarge lamp is part of the cleaning\n\n272\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.510\nprocess neutralizes the charge\nthat is on the paper, or excuse me\n\n273\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:17.660\nthat is on the EP drum left from the last\nbasically printed media that came out.\n\n274\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.170\nThen we have charging.\n\n275\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.510\nNow when we have charging, what we end up\nhaving is a strong negative charge that's\n\n276\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.980\nplaced on the electrostatic or\nthe EP drum, the imaging drum.\n\n277\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.950\nAnd so that's the next process right.\n\n278\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.630\nNow you might hear this called charging,\nyou might hear it called conditioning.\n\n279\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.340\nConditioning is conditioning\nthe drum itself.\n\n280\n00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.610\nNow we're putting a strong\ncharge on the drum itself.\n\n281\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.080\nThe next thing that you have\nis what's known as exposing.\n\n282\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.360\nExposing, if you will,\n\n283\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.030\nor writing, exposing is where the laser\nis writing to the drum, right?\n\n284\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.100\nIt's exposing the image,\nif you will, to the drum itself.\n\n285\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.100\nEverywhere the laser writes to the drum it\nactually reduces the charge a little bit.\n\n286\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.878\nI remember some of the numbers,\nit reduces it\n\n287\n00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:03.798\ndown to like 150 volts\nif I remember right.\n\n288\n00:15:03.798 --> 00:15:11.030\nSo it's a 600 volt charge is placed on\nthe drum and it reduces it down to a 150.\n\n289\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.090\nAgain that's the writing phase or\nthe exposing phase if you will.\n\n290\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.880\nNow the developing phase\nis as that EP drum passes\n\n291\n00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.500\nunder the toner hopper, what happens is\nthe toner is attracted, it's pulled down.\n\n292\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.980\nIt is a loose transfer, it is pulled\ndown to the EP drum or the imaging drum.\n\n293\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.860\nThat is the developing phase.\n\n294\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.540\nDeveloping is what I hear regardless\nof the CompTIA version or\n\n295\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.190\ntheir terminology or\njust terminology out there.\n\n296\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.540\nAgain that is the toner its self\nactually adhering to the EP drum.\n\n297\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.630\nTransferring, well,\nI'm glad they kept that one the same.\n\n298\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.793\nTransferring is exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n299\n00:15:44.793 --> 00:15:48.128\nTransferring's interesting because\nwhat happens with transferring is,\n\n300\n00:15:48.128 --> 00:15:50.063\nremember we talked about the corona wires?\n\n301\n00:15:50.063 --> 00:15:52.655\nYou have a set of corona\nwires that charge the drum,\n\n302\n00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:56.454\nbut you also have a set of corona wires\nThat put a positive strong, positive\n\n303\n00:15:56.454 --> 00:16:00.760\ncharge on the paper and actually charges\nthe paper, right, and opposite attract.\n\n304\n00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.227\nSo as the EP drum rotates,\nthe toner that's adhered to the EP drum,\n\n305\n00:16:05.227 --> 00:16:10.080\nthe imaging drum, is actually pulled down\nto the positive charge on the paper.\n\n306\n00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.820\nNow, here's the problem with\nthe transferring phase.\n\n307\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.001\nWe're not completely done cuz we still\nhave what's known as the fusing phase, and\n\n308\n00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:17.145\nthis is where fusion goes on.\n\n309\n00:16:17.145 --> 00:16:22.558\nAnd when we talk about fusing phase, the\npaper that now has the media come right\n\n310\n00:16:22.558 --> 00:16:28.590\nthrough, basically the printed paper\ngoes right through these fusing rollers.\n\n311\n00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.010\nAnd these fusing rollers apply pressure,\nand they apply heat.\n\n312\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.270\nInside of the toner, you have basically\na very fine metal powder, and\n\n313\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.100\nyou have plastics.\n\n314\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.200\nThe fusing rollers will heat up\nto about 350 degrees or so, and\n\n315\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.040\nthey will literally melt the plastic,\nif you will, right to the paper itself.\n\n316\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.831\nThis is one of the things\nthat you can keep in mind,\n\n317\n00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:53.488\nthat a fusing roller is dirty or\nmalfunctioning or overheated and\n\n318\n00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:56.361\ngot warped,\nis when the printed output comes out.\n\n319\n00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:59.451\nI don't know if you've ever done this,\nDan, where you pick up the piece of paper,\n\n320\n00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.288\nand you can kind of smear\nthe printed output.\n\n321\n00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:03.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can actually do that too if you\n\n322\n00:17:03.581 --> 00:17:08.040\npull the paper out and don't allow it to\ncool down, and you can actually smear it.\n\n323\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.380\nAnd that, a lot of times,\n\n324\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.540\nis a tell tale sign that the fusing\nroller has overheated and warped itself.\n\n325\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.770\nAnd rather than being, let's see here,\nrather than being nice circles here, that\n\n326\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:22.013\nare making contact with the paper roll\nthrough friction, it's kinda warped here.\n\n327\n00:17:22.013 --> 00:17:27.370\nAnd it misses some as it turns, it\nmisses actually heating up that plastic.\n\n328\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.276\nSo do definitely keep that in mind.\n\n329\n00:17:29.276 --> 00:17:34.140\nSo the fusing, again, is the last\nprocess in the laser print process, and\n\n330\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.820\nthat's that phase that\nheats up the toner and\n\n331\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.050\nbasically melts the plastic in it,\nand it adheres the toner to the page.\n\n332\n00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.930\nNow, we're gonna talk a little bit more\nabout things like safety precautions,\n\n333\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.920\noperational procedures,\nand electrical safety.\n\n334\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.610\nBut I do wanna take a mention,\nor just take a second to mention\n\n335\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.150\nabout the fact that when you talk about a\nlaser printer toner, toner's very caustic,\n\n336\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.602\nand it's also toxic.\n\n337\n00:17:57.602 --> 00:18:00.601\nAll right, you do not wanna\nget this stuff on your hands.\n\n338\n00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.720\nA lot of times-\n&gt;&gt; You sure don't wanna breathe it in.\n\n339\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's another thing,\nthat's a great thing.\n\n340\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.857\nIn fact, one of our other hosts,\nDon Pezet,\n\n341\n00:18:07.857 --> 00:18:11.682\nwas talking about having to work\naround some of these huge toners.\n\n342\n00:18:11.682 --> 00:18:15.478\nAnd he would put gloves and a mask on,\nand he would scrape the excess toner off.\n\n343\n00:18:15.478 --> 00:18:19.780\nUsually if you're going to clean up toner,\n\n344\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.800\nyou want to make sure that you have\na toner filter on a specialized vacuum.\n\n345\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.405\nThe other thing you don't wanna do\nbecause it's messy, it's really messy.\n\n346\n00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:30.176\nIf you've got gloves on, latex or\nvinyl gloves if you're allergic,\n\n347\n00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.649\nwhichever one you might wear,\nand you take that toner and\n\n348\n00:18:32.649 --> 00:18:35.705\nyou try to rub it off that glove,\nit doesn't like to come off.\n\n349\n00:18:35.705 --> 00:18:39.265\nThe other thing, too, is that it reacts,\nand it's so sensitive to heat.\n\n350\n00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:42.975\nYour first thought process might be, if I\nget it on bare skin, I'm gonna walk over\n\n351\n00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:46.875\nto the sink and do what we always do,\nwash our hands in warm, soapy water.\n\n352\n00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.510\nWell, guess what the warm\nwater's gonna do to the toner?\n\n353\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.433\nIt could melt the plastics and\nthen actually fuse it to your skin.\n\n354\n00:18:52.433 --> 00:18:53.219\n&gt;&gt; That'd be fun.\n\n355\n00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:55.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's always a great day at the office.\n\n356\n00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:57.870\nSo, be very careful with toner,\nknow that it is toxic.\n\n357\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.360\nIt is not something to be taken lightly.\n\n358\n00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.334\nAnd I can't stress what Dan says enough,\ndo not breathe that stuff in.\n\n359\n00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:07.837\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get one of those outbreak\nmonkey suits before I get anywhere near\n\n360\n00:19:07.837 --> 00:19:09.010\nthe toner assembly now.\n\n361\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:09.636\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n362\n00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.609\n&gt;&gt; We're totally paranoid.\n\n363\n00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:15.035\n&gt;&gt; The total ESD smocks,\nwe just came out of the clean room here.\n\n364\n00:19:15.035 --> 00:19:15.968\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n365\n00:19:15.968 --> 00:19:20.529\n&gt;&gt; Hazmat and all, or the other thing too\nis, again, I'm not trying to be like all\n\n366\n00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:25.450\ngoing green and environmental and stuff on\nthis, but you dispose of these properly.\n\n367\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.010\nGo to a local collection agency.\n\n368\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.861\nA lot of times, your companies that\nsupply you with toner cartridges,\n\n369\n00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:33.490\nthey get some kind of write off and\na lot of times,\n\n370\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.491\nwhat they'll do is they'll have\na self-addressed box that it comes in.\n\n371\n00:19:37.491 --> 00:19:40.920\nAnd you can actually give it back to them,\nand they can take care of it for you.\n\n372\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.120\nSo, definitely be careful on that, guys.\n\n373\n00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.082\nTake care of yourselves,\ntake care of the people around you.\n\n374\n00:19:46.082 --> 00:19:49.792\nRemember, I don't care what component\nyou're working on in a printing factory,\n\n375\n00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:51.912\na printing shop, if you will,\nor in an office,\n\n376\n00:19:51.912 --> 00:19:53.350\nyou guys can never be replaced, right?\n\n377\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.644\nThe printer, everything else in\nthat printer can be replaced.\n\n378\n00:19:55.644 --> 00:19:58.700\nIt is not worth you hurting yourself.\n\n379\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.837\nAll right, so, Dan,\nthat's the laser printer here,\n\n380\n00:20:00.837 --> 00:20:02.948\nwe've got a couple more that\nwe gotta talk about here.\n\n381\n00:20:02.948 --> 00:20:05.432\nAnd this one is what is\nknown as the inkjet printer,\n\n382\n00:20:05.432 --> 00:20:10.820\nit's probably one of the most common\nprinters in the industry today.\n\n383\n00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.006\nIt's actually a really fascinating-\n&gt;&gt; I think I got one with my cereal box.\n\n384\n00:20:14.006 --> 00:20:16.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Most definitely.\n\n385\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.042\nThis goes back to, I think it was Hewitt\nPacker, I might have that wrong, but I\n\n386\n00:20:20.042 --> 00:20:24.032\nthink it was HP was one of the first ones,\nand it originally was called a bubble jet.\n\n387\n00:20:24.032 --> 00:20:25.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, bubble jet.\n&gt;&gt; The bubble jet,\n\n388\n00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:30.224\nyeah, and we got a little diagram here of\nwhat a inkjet printer might look like,\n\n389\n00:20:30.224 --> 00:20:34.170\na couple of different components\ninside of the inkjet printer.\n\n390\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.512\nYou got the ink cartridge,\nand you have a print head.\n\n391\n00:20:37.512 --> 00:20:42.740\nAll right, the ink cartridge is what\nsupplies the ink to the print head itself.\n\n392\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.310\nThe print head can actually,\nI guess, you'd say dispel the ink.\n\n393\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.503\nI don't know if that's the right answer.\n\n394\n00:20:47.503 --> 00:20:51.186\nIt would project the ink down onto the\npaper through a couple different means.\n\n395\n00:20:51.186 --> 00:20:53.020\nIt could be electricity and vibration.\n\n396\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.290\nIt could be heat.\n\n397\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.090\nThey called it a bubble jet because what\nwould happen is the print head heats up,\n\n398\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.470\nand it actually causes a bubble and\nit explodes essentially and\n\n399\n00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.550\nit forces it, a droplet, if you will.\n\n400\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.956\nAnd a droplet, when we say droplet, we're\ntalking microns, one millionth of a meter.\n\n401\n00:21:06.956 --> 00:21:09.270\nMicrons are very, very small, and\n\n402\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.470\nthe only thing I want you to keep in\nmind when it comes to ink cartridges and\n\n403\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.870\nprint heads, you have two\ndifferent types of print heads.\n\n404\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.540\nYou have what's known as\na fixed print head, and\n\n405\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.630\nyou have what's known as\na replaceable print head.\n\n406\n00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.880\nNow, if you go into a store and you look\ndown that aisle there in one of your\n\n407\n00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.170\nfavorite stores, and you see all of\nthese replaceable ink cartridges.\n\n408\n00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.200\nAnd you just put the ink cartridge in,\nand you close the lid on it,\n\n409\n00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.618\nthat is what is known as a replaceable\nprint head, it has a benefit.\n\n410\n00:21:34.618 --> 00:21:37.918\nOne of the benefits is,\nthe print head doesn't need to be cleaned.\n\n411\n00:21:37.918 --> 00:21:40.620\nAnd let me careful on that\none cuz ink dries up,\n\n412\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.695\nI don't mean that you shouldn't do cycling\nprocesses, you have to use your printer.\n\n413\n00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:48.200\nIf you don't use an ink jet printer,\nthe ink can clog and\n\n414\n00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.970\nthen the print head has to be replaced.\n\n415\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.120\nBut the thing is,\nwhen you change the ink cartridges,\n\n416\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.760\nyou're actually replacing the print head\nas well, it's part of the same assembly.\n\n417\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.220\nYou also have,\nas a part of the print head assembly,\n\n418\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.260\nwhat's known as a fixed\nhead inkjet printer.\n\n419\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.410\nAnd this is where\nthe cartridge is replaced, but\n\n420\n00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.150\nthe print head is based itself\nin the assembly, right?\n\n421\n00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.250\nNow what are the benefits?\n\n422\n00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.250\nAll right, well, one of the drawbacks is\nthat the print head assembly on a fixed\n\n423\n00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.190\nprint head fails, then chances are,\nyou have to replace the whole assembly or\n\n424\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.580\npotentially even replace\nthe whole printer.\n\n425\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.730\nThe good thing about a fixed\nprint head assembly is the fact\n\n426\n00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.220\nthey require less calibration.\n\n427\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.057\nA print head that is replaceable through\nthe common inkjet cartridges typically\n\n428\n00:22:34.057 --> 00:22:35.416\nhas to be calibrated.\n\n429\n00:22:35.416 --> 00:22:39.780\nAnd it goes through a calibration process\nto where it knows that it's lined up where\n\n430\n00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.270\nit should be.\n\n431\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.310\nThat is something to keep in mind.\n\n432\n00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.710\nNow some of the other things that we have,\n\n433\n00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.330\nyou can see we have things\nlike belt spindles here.\n\n434\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.700\nAnd you can see a drive belt.\n\n435\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.620\nYou have a drive belt that actually\nmoves the print head back and forth.\n\n436\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.789\nOne of the things to keep in mind,\n\n437\n00:22:55.789 --> 00:23:00.745\nit is not a good idea that if your printer\nloses power, to leave the print head\n\n438\n00:23:00.745 --> 00:23:06.025\nwherever the position was in the middle of\nthe print job, and let me tell you why.\n\n439\n00:23:06.025 --> 00:23:10.000\nIn those cases, the print nozzles\nare open, and they have ink in them.\n\n440\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.211\nAnd that means if you leave it like that,\nthe ink can dry out, clogs the print head.\n\n441\n00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:20.269\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that\nyou might see that the print head moves to\n\n442\n00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:23.780\none side and stops,\nthat's called print head parking.\n\n443\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.640\nAnd what is does is it helps to\ntry to alleviate the fact that\n\n444\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.210\nthe ink can dry up in the nozzle itself.\n\n445\n00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.490\nSo one of the biggest things,\n\n446\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.680\nto make sure that your print nozzles don't\nget clogged up, just use it, just use it.\n\n447\n00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:44.750\nThey do say run, it's not the calibration,\nbut like color adjustments and stuff.\n\n448\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.952\nYou can run these little tests\non it that prints a little bit.\n\n449\n00:23:47.952 --> 00:23:50.613\nI have a problem with that, and\nthis is a personal opinion here, so\n\n450\n00:23:50.613 --> 00:23:52.672\nI'm gonna go off on a little rant here for\na second.\n\n451\n00:23:52.672 --> 00:23:56.266\nBecause when I run one of\nthose nozzle cleaning or\n\n452\n00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:58.992\nunclogging tests, what am I doing?\n\n453\n00:23:58.992 --> 00:24:00.713\nI'm wasting ink, right.\n\n454\n00:24:00.713 --> 00:24:06.110\nAnd ink can cost $75 to replace,\nall right.\n\n455\n00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:11.520\nBack about five or six years ago,\ninkjet ink was at around $7,000 a gallon.\n\n456\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.990\nOne gallon.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of money.\n\n457\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.080\n&gt;&gt; It's worth more than\nits weight in gold, and\n\n458\n00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.245\nthat's why whoever invented this stuff-\n&gt;&gt; Who controls the ink controls\n\n459\n00:24:20.245 --> 00:24:20.911\nthe universe.\n\n460\n00:24:20.911 --> 00:24:21.814\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n461\n00:24:21.814 --> 00:24:25.540\nIt's more costly than water, if you will.\n\n462\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.170\nOr more valuable in some sense than water.\n\n463\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.408\nAnd whoever's looking down at all those\naisles of inkjet cartridges is saying,\n\n464\n00:24:32.408 --> 00:24:35.538\nyeah, I'm raking in the money,\nso It's very expensive.\n\n465\n00:24:35.538 --> 00:24:38.973\nIf you wanna keep the nozzles unclogged,\njust use it once in a while,\n\n466\n00:24:38.973 --> 00:24:41.993\njust every once in a while just\nprint something out, right,\n\n467\n00:24:41.993 --> 00:24:45.074\nprint your favorite banana bread recipe or\nsomething or Dan,\n\n468\n00:24:45.074 --> 00:24:47.949\nprint out a set of tablature and\npractice on your guitar.\n\n469\n00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:49.405\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n470\n00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:54.880\nYou also have as part of the feeders, you\ncan do, again, it's usually friction feed.\n\n471\n00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.610\nYou have a stepper motor in it that's\nresponsible for moving things back and\n\n472\n00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:04.840\nforth across the carriage, and\nthe belt that's associated with it.\n\n473\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.100\nNow, one of the interesting things about\nthe inkjet printer, It's the only printer\n\n474\n00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:14.140\nin the list that doesn't make\ncontact with the media itself.\n\n475\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.140\nThermal printer?\n\n476\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.620\nStrikes the media.\n\n477\n00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.110\nLaser printer?\n\n478\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.150\nToner strikes the media and\nwe have friction.\n\n479\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.950\nInk jet printer doesn't\ntouch the actual media.\n\n480\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.750\nIt's kinda interesting how that works.\n\n481\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.430\nSo just a little side note,\n\n482\n00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.170\nI don't think it's gonna be something\nthat you need to worry about on the exam.\n\n483\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.660\nNow on the last printers Dan, we gotta\ntalk about here is what's known as\n\n484\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.460\nthe impact printer and\nthe impact printer for\n\n485\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.280\nsome of you that are a little bit younger\nmay have never seen one of these, right.\n\n486\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.270\nThe impact printer is the one that\nis a angry little printer and\n\n487\n00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.910\nwhen you run a print job it vibrates\nitself right off the desk and\n\n488\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.400\nwalks itself right out the front door.\n\n489\n00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.080\n&gt;&gt; It is the Joe Pesci of printers.\n\n490\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.050\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right.\n\n491\n00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.385\n&gt;&gt; Blunt force trauma.\n\n492\n00:25:54.385 --> 00:25:55.264\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n493\n00:25:55.264 --> 00:26:01.690\nit uses some kind of striking\ncomponent to print the media as well.\n\n494\n00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.500\nMany different kinds.\n\n495\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.040\nOne of the fastest ones,\nI actually got an example of one here.\n\n496\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.490\nI think this is an Epson, yeah.\n\n497\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:11.100\nEpson is big impact printer manufacturer.\n\n498\n00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.130\nThis is called a line printer.\n\n499\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.185\nAnd the reason they call it a line\nprinter is cuz in a single pass,\n\n500\n00:26:15.185 --> 00:26:17.020\nit can print a single line of text.\n\n501\n00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.360\nIt's one of the fastest line printers or,\n\n502\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.910\nI'm sorry,\nfastest impact printers there are.\n\n503\n00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.410\nThere are other ones that\nare absolutely obsolete.\n\n504\n00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.080\nFor instance you have\nthe daisy wheel printer.\n\n505\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.890\nI believe this is also called\na character form printer.\n\n506\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.630\nIt was one of the very first early,\nwhen I say early,\n\n507\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.280\nI think it was connected to one of\nthe original Apples when you say printers.\n\n508\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.040\nAnd this is the one that's kinda like\nthe label maker, the manual label maker.\n\n509\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.400\nIt has preformed characters and\nthere's a striking component\n\n510\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.030\nthat hits the character and\nit rotates and hits the character.\n\n511\n00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.210\nAgain, these are obsolete today.\n\n512\n00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.510\nYou don't have to worry about them.\n\n513\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.320\nThere's another one that's a little\nproprietary in its nature,\n\n514\n00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.280\nthis is called a typeball.\n\n515\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like you see in a typewriter.\n\n516\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, and\nit's also one, a form of a character\n\n517\n00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:07.160\nform type printer where it's got\nthe preformed characters on it as well.\n\n518\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.760\nNow the one that is the most common\nthat I don't have a picture for\n\n519\n00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.320\nis called the dot matrix printer.\n\n520\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.770\nThe dot matrix printer has\ntypically a square print head\n\n521\n00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.600\nthat has a series of striking pins.\n\n522\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.170\nAnd they call it a dot matrix because\nit's a series of dots that form\n\n523\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.400\nthe printed output.\n\n524\n00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.543\nAnd there's a couple of different types.\n\n525\n00:27:23.543 --> 00:27:27.453\nThere's a 24 pin type that\nhas basically puts more,\n\n526\n00:27:27.453 --> 00:27:32.220\nand thank you, our chat room just\nlet me know what the typeball is.\n\n527\n00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.280\nThe typeball is the Selectric,\nthe IBM Selectric.\n\n528\n00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.550\nThat's exactly right.\n\n529\n00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:42.950\nBut the dot matrix, the 24 pin printhead\nis one that's called NLQ printing.\n\n530\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.840\nIt's near letter quality and then what it\ndoes, it just has more dots per character.\n\n531\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.790\nSo you get a little bit more clearer,\nif you will, of an output.\n\n532\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.300\nPrimarily they're fairly outdated today.\n\n533\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.560\nThe impact printers that you see\ntoday are still line printers.\n\n534\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.390\nAnd you might say, well,\nwait a second, Wes, really?\n\n535\n00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.620\nStill?\nImpact printers?\n\n536\n00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.388\nAbsolutely.\nHave you ever been to a mechanic shop?\n\n537\n00:28:03.388 --> 00:28:06.030\nYou're probably gonna see one,\nand why is that?\n\n538\n00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.549\nThey are the best printer for\nmulti-layer printing.\n\n539\n00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.840\nCarbon copies?\n\n540\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.890\nThat's why we still use them.\n\n541\n00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:17.720\nYou see receipts there in carbon copy\nwhere it has your printed text and\n\n542\n00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:23.080\nhas carbon layer and then it has the text\nbehind or another sheet under it.\n\n543\n00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.740\nMultilayer printing,\nthey're still absolutely phenomenal.\n\n544\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.174\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it'll create enough\npressure to push through to the other\n\n545\n00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:29.765\nlayers.\n\n546\n00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:31.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right absolutely.\n\n547\n00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.980\nThe other thing to keep in mind\nnow with the print head assembly,\n\n548\n00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.526\nthe print head assembly is one that\nyou have to be careful with because it\n\n549\n00:28:38.526 --> 00:28:44.360\ncan get warped so do keep that in mind,\nit can get warped.\n\n550\n00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.610\nThese use two different\ntypes of feed mechanisms.\n\n551\n00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.232\nPrimarily today what they're\nusing is friction feed.\n\n552\n00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:56.420\nAgain, that's applying\nfriction to pull in the paper.\n\n553\n00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.780\nThe older ones you might have seen too\nlike for old spreadsheets types, and\n\n554\n00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.400\nwhat they would have you see\nin the side of the paper.\n\n555\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.310\nYou have cutouts.\n\n556\n00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.260\nRight, little notches.\n\n557\n00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.050\nAnd then you essentially have what's known\nas what looks like a tractor tire, and\n\n558\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.180\nthose notches would go into\nthe cutouts within the paper.\n\n559\n00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.841\nAnd it would pull the paper through.\n\n560\n00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:16.215\nThe printer itself, those are called\ntractor feeds and they're called tractor\n\n561\n00:29:16.215 --> 00:29:19.200\nfeeds because the feed mechanism\nlooks like a series of tractor tires.\n\n562\n00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.220\nAnd again, those cleats,\nif you will, actually\n\n563\n00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:27.050\npull the paper through the openings and\nnotches that are cut out within it.\n\n564\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.480\nLet's see, what else?\n\n565\n00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.030\nWith the impact paper keep in mind\nthere could be different types,\n\n566\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.140\nhere especially we are talking\nabout carbon copy.\n\n567\n00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.150\nAlso remember that there's a ribbon print\nhead assembly or a ribbon I should say\n\n568\n00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:45.680\nthat you're making a strike against and\nit places the ink into the media too.\n\n569\n00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.780\nAll right, so that really has\npretty much all of our printers.\n\n570\n00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.630\nThere is one last little thing\nthat I want to tackle and\n\n571\n00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.830\nthis is something when we're looking at\nour diagrams here that we can kind of\n\n572\n00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:01.510\nbring up and\nthat is what they call virtual printing.\n\n573\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.470\nAnd let me go ahead and\ndo a command P here.\n\n574\n00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.740\nIf you are in Windows it's Windows key P.\n\n575\n00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.140\nAnd this is where I take\nmy printed output and\n\n576\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.170\nessentially what I do\nis print it to a PDF.\n\n577\n00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.230\nSo let me show you\nthere's a different type.\n\n578\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.030\nPrint to file you might\nhear it print to PDF.\n\n579\n00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.490\nThat's the most common format.\n\n580\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.760\nMicrosoft has their proprietary\nXPS not really common.\n\n581\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.179\nYou can use it for sure but most people.\n\n582\n00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:27.355\n&gt;&gt; It's as common as Windows.\n\n583\n00:30:27.355 --> 00:30:29.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's as common as Windows.\n\n584\n00:30:29.012 --> 00:30:30.317\nYeah, that's a really good point, Dan.\n\n585\n00:30:30.317 --> 00:30:30.906\n&gt;&gt; Just not used.\n\n586\n00:30:30.906 --> 00:30:31.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n587\n00:30:31.565 --> 00:30:33.155\nyou could do things like print to image.\n\n588\n00:30:33.155 --> 00:30:34.145\nLet me give you an example.\n\n589\n00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:43.235\nSo this is an example of\nhorrible typing skills.\n\n590\n00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:44.015\nAll right.\nSo\n\n591\n00:30:44.015 --> 00:30:47.680\nyou guys definitely don't need\nto be learning that from me.\n\n592\n00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.980\nAll right and I say I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet's print to PDF.\n\n593\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.440\nAll right so we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna save this as a PDF.\n\n594\n00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.650\nIt kinda gives you the chance\nto see what's going on here.\n\n595\n00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.120\nAnd we'll save it to the desktop here.\n\n596\n00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.400\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nwe'll call it Bad Typing.\n\n597\n00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.450\nAll right and we'll go ahead and\nwe will save that.\n\n598\n00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.630\nAll right, so now what we've done\nis we have essentially created\n\n599\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.580\na virtual document here and\nif I go ahead and\n\n600\n00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.310\njust close this down here and\nget back to the desktop.\n\n601\n00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.275\n&gt;&gt; You just explained to the whole\nworld why I'm not a huge fan of Mac OS.\n\n602\n00:31:22.275 --> 00:31:22.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n603\n00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.620\n&gt;&gt; Because it's just very unintuitive.\n\n604\n00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.768\nIn a Windows environment,\nit would say print to PDF.\n\n605\n00:31:27.768 --> 00:31:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right, or print to XPS.\n\n606\n00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.920\nThat's what it does it's like,\nI get it I'm printing to a PDF.\n\n607\n00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.160\nJust save as PDF.\n\n608\n00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.157\n&gt;&gt; You might hear that call it\nvirtual printer sometimes,too,\n\n609\n00:31:39.157 --> 00:31:40.664\nthey call it virtual printer.\n\n610\n00:31:40.664 --> 00:31:42.491\nThey call it out on\nthe objectives as virtual, but\n\n611\n00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:45.425\nthere's a few different types,\nprint to file, print to PDF.\n\n612\n00:31:45.425 --> 00:31:46.390\nDan's has already mentioned,\n\n613\n00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.130\ncommonality of Windows XPS is\ntheir format printing image.\n\n614\n00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:55.000\nBut you could see if I open this up, this\nis an example of horrible typing skills\n\n615\n00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.355\nand it's now a PDF, so the level of\nwhat you can edit after the fact.\n\n616\n00:32:00.355 --> 00:32:02.845\nYou've got other software that you can\nturn around and put this PDF in and\n\n617\n00:32:02.845 --> 00:32:04.145\nyou can modify it if you need to.\n\n618\n00:32:04.145 --> 00:32:09.135\nVery handy cuz the portable\ndigital format, it's very handy.\n\n619\n00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:12.515\nI can turn around and\nI can hey Dan I know this scale,\n\n620\n00:32:12.515 --> 00:32:13.755\nI got to share it with you man.\n\n621\n00:32:13.755 --> 00:32:14.935\nYou got to take it home tonight.\n\n622\n00:32:14.935 --> 00:32:18.275\nI don't want Dan to have to sit here and\ntake some printed type home.\n\n623\n00:32:18.275 --> 00:32:21.320\nI say no that's okay I'll\nemail it to your phone.\n\n624\n00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.740\nGives me a good way that I can\nprint some kind of output.\n\n625\n00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.740\nAnd again, you can even do it to images.\n\n626\n00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.960\nI can turn around and\ntake an image of, I don't know,\n\n627\n00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.520\nguitar I like and say,\nyou gotta check this guitar out.\n\n628\n00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.975\nI can print it to an image,\nput it in a PDF format, if you will, and\n\n629\n00:32:35.975 --> 00:32:37.925\nthen turn around and send it to Dan.\n\n630\n00:32:37.925 --> 00:32:40.715\nSo couple of different\nthings you could see and\n\n631\n00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:43.905\nagain it is typically\ncalled virtual printers.\n\n632\n00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:46.715\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Wes, we definitely\nwalked through all the different types of\n\n633\n00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:51.085\nprinters that you might encounter as\nan A+ technician and their processes.\n\n634\n00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:54.415\nHow they actually do what it is they\ndo and the difference between them.\n\n635\n00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:57.690\nThat being said it looks like we\nare Well out of time for this episode.\n\n636\n00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.537\nWe do thank you for watching,\nbut signing off for\n\n637\n00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:01.260\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n638\n00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.324\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n639\n00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:04.885\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n640\n00:33:04.885 -->

00:00:08.144\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:11.814\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for choosing IT\nPro TV, helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.248\nI'm your host Zack Memis.\n\n7\n00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:23.100\nWe're A-plus Printer maintenance\nist he episode title here and\n\n8\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.040\nwe have Wed Brian who is our IT expert and\nagreed to drop in and show us the way.\n\n9\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.390\nWes good to have you, thanks for joining.\n\n10\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they threatened\nme said if I didnt,\n\n11\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.856\nNo just kidding,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:33.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We are talking about well\n\n13\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.550\n&gt;&gt; Printer maintenance,\n\n14\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.200\nright, in other episodes we've\ntalked about the printer.\n\n15\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.070\nAnd we've talked about a lot of\ndifferent printer technologies, right.\n\n16\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.530\nWe've talked about the components that\nyou can find within those printers.\n\n17\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.160\nWell, if you're not aware of those,\nthen you'd need to go back and\n\n18\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.890\nwatch that episode and\nthen come back to this episode and\n\n19\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.890\nwe can talk about how you'd maintain those\ndifferent printer technologies right.\n\n20\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.610\nSo another episode is we talked about the\nmajor printing technologies like the laser\n\n21\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.560\nprinter, right?\n\n22\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.680\nWe've talked about things like the thermo\nprinter, right, using some kind of heat.\n\n23\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.470\nAnd there's a few different types of\nthe thermo printers out there, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.240\nOne of the most common ones,\na direct thermo printer, right.\n\n25\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.940\nWe've also got things like\nyour impact printers, right.\n\n26\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.920\nImpact printers where we've got some\nstriking components that strikes a ribbon\n\n27\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.490\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n28\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.600\nthen presses that ribbon into the media,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.430\nWe also talked about, well one of the most\ncommon one especially in the whole market,\n\n30\n00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.110\nis the inkjet printer.\n\n31\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.100\nGot a lot of different moving components\nwithin them, and sometimes these\n\n32\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.610\ncomponents have to be either cleaned or\nmaybe even replaced, right?\n\n33\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.980\nWe have consumables, right?\n\n34\n00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.330\nThe consumables are things like,\nfor instance, your laser toner.\n\n35\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.180\nYour laser toner inside\nof a laser printer.\n\n36\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.180\nEventually your going to\nrun out of laser toner and\n\n37\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.100\nyour going to have to replace that.\n\n38\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.630\nWe have things like your impact printers.\n\n39\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.330\nYour impact printer have ink ribbons.\n\n40\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.440\nI guess you could say impact ribbons.\n\n41\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.050\nThey're going to need to be replaced too.\n\n42\n00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.940\nAnd I don't really have\nto tell too many of you,\n\n43\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.890\nif you've been around any kind of printer\nat all, especially in a home environment,\n\n44\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.050\nright, we have ink cartridges, and ink\ncartridges have to be replaced too right,\n\n45\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.110\nand a lot of times they cost more than\nthe printer does when you buy it right?\n\n46\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Certainly they do.\n\n47\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.550\n&gt;&gt; So we better talk about a few\ndifferent components, right.\n\n48\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.710\nSometimes, you'll see that\ncertain techniques or\n\n49\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.200\nI would say certain situations\nhappen to all printers, right?\n\n50\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.460\nThings like debris.\n\n51\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.080\nIt doesn't matter what type of printer\nthat you have, it means that eventually\n\n52\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.540\nyou're gonna get some kind of debris\nin there that needs to be cleaned.\n\n53\n00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.570\nDoesn't matter if it's a laser printer,\na laser printer,\n\n54\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.690\nthe debris really could\njust be leftover toner.\n\n55\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.630\nIf you have an impact printer,\n\n56\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.500\nit could be things like the print\nhead assembly gets a little corroded.\n\n57\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.650\nSo, not the thermal printer, excuse me.\n\n58\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.520\nThe thermal printer it\ngets a little corroded.\n\n59\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.580\nAn impact printer, while these things\nare just angry little printers anyway and\n\n60\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.180\ntractor feeds,\nthey get clogged with debris and\n\n61\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.780\nlittle remnants of paper, as well.\n\n62\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.510\nCould even be the fact that one of\nthe things that's common to have around\n\n63\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.890\nprinter’s right are staplers and\nstaple removers, right.\n\n64\n00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.390\nAnd one of these things gets down\ninto the printers accidentally and\n\n65\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.360\nthey can cause all kinds of havoc, right.\n\n66\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.310\nAnd we definitely talk about for\n\n67\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.440\ninstance different things like\nthe laser printer if you happen to get.\n\n68\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.110\nA staple down inside of\nthe print assembly, well,\n\n69\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.960\nyou end up having a scratched DP drum and\nthat can cause all kinds of things.\n\n70\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.140\nThen it's not just maintenance or\ncleaning,\n\n71\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.400\nyou're actually gonna have to\ndo some kind of repair work.\n\n72\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.690\nSo, there are some things to make sure\nthat we know for the exam when it comes to\n\n73\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.890\nthe general upkeep or\nmaintenance of your printers, right?\n\n74\n00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.310\nRemember the printing technologies,\nlaser printer, right?\n\n75\n00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.710\nWe've talked about thermal printers,\nimpact printers, and\n\n76\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.530\nthe most common one in the home\nenvironment is the ink jet printer.\n\n77\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.160\nEach one have slightly different\ntechniques in how you keep them\n\n78\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.670\nup and running.\n\n79\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.570\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll dive into the very first one.\n\n80\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.460\nOne of the very first ones they\ncall out the laser printer, right?\n\n81\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.400\nAnd the laser printer,\n\n82\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.800\nwhat are some of the things that we\nsee inside of the laser printer?\n\n83\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.400\nWell, remember, there's a lot of\ncomponents that they want you to know\n\n84\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.620\non the A+ exam when it comes\nto the printers, right?\n\n85\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.270\nWe've got things like fusing assemblies,\nright?\n\n86\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.390\nTransfer rollers.\n\n87\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.980\nWe've talked about things like corona\nwires, let alone the media, right?\n\n88\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.260\nWell sometimes all these moving components\nmight just go to there wear and tear.\n\n89\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.810\nAny mechanical device just does.\n\n90\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.030\nIt's not a matter of if it fails, it\nusually just a matter of when it fails or\n\n91\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.180\nhow long it last, right?\n\n92\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n93\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n94\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.650\nLaser printer, typically come,\n\n95\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.900\nyou can buy things like laser\nprinter maintenance kits right, and\n\n96\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.370\nthey have all different kinds of parts\nthat could potentially need to be replace.\n\n97\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.921\nNow on the exam they just\ncalled out maintenance kit.\n\n98\n00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:26.959\nYeah well that is a little\ngeneric We kinda wanna show you,\n\n99\n00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.555\nyou know some of the components you\ncould see inside the maintainance\n\n100\n00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.668\nkit one of the main things you have to do.\n\n101\n00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:36.145\nWhether you have to do any kind of repairs\nin the mechanical (UNKNOWN) a lot of\n\n102\n00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:39.685\ntimes with the consumables you\nhave to replace the laser toner.\n\n103\n00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:41.250\nRight this happens.\n\n104\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.220\nI want you to be also mindful of some of\nour operational safety procedures that\n\n105\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.850\nwe've talked about.\n\n106\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.180\nRemember toner and general.\n\n107\n00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.410\nAnytime you are working with\ntoner you have to keep in mind\n\n108\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.120\nthat it is a toxic substance.\n\n109\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.260\nIt's fine pieces of metal and plastic.\n\n110\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.710\nIs it something that you wanna be\nbreathing in if it happens to be toner\n\n111\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.290\nspills.\n\n112\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.810\nThey have vacuums that have special\ntoner filters in them just to make sure\n\n113\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.330\nit doesnt get in the air and\nyou are not gonna be breathing it in.\n\n114\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.170\nWe certainly don't want to get in under\nyour so any time you're dealing with any\n\n115\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.470\nkind of toner spill or toner mess if you\nwill, remember your safety procedures.\n\n116\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.620\nYou want to have gloves on.\n\n117\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.050\nYou want to have a mask on if you can.\n\n118\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.980\nYou want to make sure that you've got a\ntoner cloth and again the toner cloth is,\n\n119\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.590\nA cloth that is made to clean that toner\nbecause it's such a fine residue if\n\n120\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.370\nyou will, and it's just a nightmare\nonce it get's on your hands too.\n\n121\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.210\nSo remember that there are some\nsafety precautions if you have,\n\n122\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.950\nmake sure that you take when it\ncomes to things like toner spills.\n\n123\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.160\nNow if its just regular replacing\nof the toner cartridges.\n\n124\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.280\nAll right, the other operational procedure\nthat we might wanna keep in mind is that,\n\n125\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.380\nyou need to be recycling\nthe toner cartridges.\n\n126\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.120\nNow, I'm not one that saying, hey you got\nto go up there and join Greenpeace and\n\n127\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.540\nbe recycling and save the planet.\n\n128\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.740\nBut again its because\nit's a toxic substance.\n\n129\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.100\nRemember that a lot of times when you're\ngonna replace toner What you can do,\n\n130\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.800\nyou can go to a company or I guess,\n\n131\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.260\nyou might have a service contract where\nyou order your toner cartridges and\n\n132\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.700\na lot of times, I know one\ncompany that I worked for, Zack.\n\n133\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.500\nThey had a pretty big toner- excuse me,\nlaser printer and they had\n\n134\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.240\na service contract and it's interesting\nbecause They had two service contracts.\n\n135\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.320\nThey had a service contract\nthat would come out and\n\n136\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.130\nfix the maintenance of the printer,\nand then we also had a contract,\n\n137\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.830\nor they had a contract, with I think\nit might have even be with HP where\n\n138\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.390\nthey would get their toner cartridges, the\nblack cartridge and the color cartridges.\n\n139\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.760\nAnd when they did, they would have\na return label already in the box.\n\n140\n00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.700\nAll you had to do is you open the box up,\nyou follow the procedure.\n\n141\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.790\nYou pull the toner cartridges that\nare spent, out of the machine.\n\n142\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.120\nYou replace the toner cartridge.\n\n143\n00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.540\nYou take the spent cartridge, put it\nback in the box, put the label on, and\n\n144\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.645\nyou send it back to the company.\n\n145\n00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:53.445\nNo whether they get a tax right off or\nsomething or they refill it and\n\n146\n00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:55.135\nthen sell it again, I don't know.\n\n147\n00:06:55.135 --> 00:06:59.555\nBut the point is the companies they're\nputting that burden on them, right?\n\n148\n00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:02.475\nAnd that's a nice thing to have that\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n149\n00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:06.782\nIf nothing else,\nPay attention to your local regulations,\n\n150\n00:07:06.782 --> 00:07:10.162\nyou probably had some kind of collection\nagency and I'm not talking about the IRS.\n\n151\n00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:14.242\nSome kind of local collection agency\nwhere you can send it to them and\n\n152\n00:07:14.242 --> 00:07:16.072\nthen they'll make sure\nthat they recycle it.\n\n153\n00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:20.082\nSo remember, toner cartridges,\nin fact, let's kind look at one here.\n\n154\n00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:24.860\nLet me just got a browser open, we'll just\ngo shopping, right Let me see if we can\n\n155\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:32.300\nfind an image that we kind of show\nyou a little bit about, here we go.\n\n156\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.750\nSo toner cartridge right, here's one of\nthem up here, and we're using, this is\n\n157\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.390\nWikimedia there, and you can see that this\nwhole assembly sometimes needs replaced.\n\n158\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.310\nRemember that you've got a lot\nof components inside of this And\n\n159\n00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.490\nthey are going to need to be replaced.\n\n160\n00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.053\nSo that's one of the things\nthat you need to keep in mind.\n\n161\n00:07:49.053 --> 00:07:52.036\nThe other thing too is when you\nare replacing toner cartridges\n\n162\n00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:55.431\nsometimes you might have to go\nthrough a little calibration, right?\n\n163\n00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.075\nAnd you go through the calibration and\n\n164\n00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:59.805\nlet's just make sure colors\nare aligned and everything else.\n\n165\n00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:04.860\nNow, another thing that you might have\nto get is something like a printer,\n\n166\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.920\nor a laser printer maintenance kit, right.\n\n167\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.820\nAnd there's all kinds of them out there.\n\n168\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.670\nIf I put, we'll go shopping.\n\n169\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.940\nI've got, Zach doesn't know it,\nbut I actually have his-\n\n170\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.700\n&gt;&gt; You've got my card again.\n\n171\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.268\n&gt;&gt; I've got your card again, right.\nSee,\n\n172\n00:08:16.268 --> 00:08:19.017\nthat's what happens when you\nwalk away from your desk and\n\n173\n00:08:19.017 --> 00:08:20.517\nleave your wallet on the desk.\n\n174\n00:08:20.517 --> 00:08:21.462\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n175\n00:08:21.462 --> 00:08:22.758\n&gt;&gt; It happens all the time.\n\n176\n00:08:22.758 --> 00:08:24.301\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go shopping here.\n\n177\n00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:27.876\nAnd we just kinda wanna show you, again,\nsome of the things that you could see\n\n178\n00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:31.190\ninside of a printer maintenance kit,\nlaser printer maintenance kit.\n\n179\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.772\nIn fact, here's one,\nthis is from Sun Data Supply.\n\n180\n00:08:33.772 --> 00:08:40.460\nKinda give them credit here because we're\nkinda using their image here, right.\n\n181\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.460\nBut some of the things that you can\nsee in here is the fusing assembly,\n\n182\n00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.721\nyou can see things like your transfer\nroller, right, separation pad, or\n\n183\n00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:48.768\nseparator pad depending\non what they call it.\n\n184\n00:08:48.768 --> 00:08:53.699\nInside of your trays, right, you can have\nthings like your tray pick up rollers,\n\n185\n00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:58.154\nright, and you might even hear\nthem called cassette trays, right.\n\n186\n00:08:58.154 --> 00:08:59.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.707\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it can kinda look like a cassette,\nright.\n\n188\n00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.284\nCassette tray separators and\nseparation pads.\n\n189\n00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:04.310\nSo that's part of a maintenance kit.\n\n190\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.450\nAnd again, remember,\nthese are mechanical parts,\n\n191\n00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.355\nand sometimes these mechanical\nparts do need replaced, right.\n\n192\n00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:14.360\nAgain, just like any other moving\ncomponents, not a matter of if it fails,\n\n193\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.690\nit's a matter of just when it fails,\nright.\n\n194\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.040\nEverything's got a certain\namount of life cycle and\n\n195\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.900\nany time you've got things that\nare just constantly moving,\n\n196\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.020\neventually they're gonna wear and\ntear and you might have to replace them.\n\n197\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.320\nNow, this might be something that,\nagain, you have a service contract and\n\n198\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.660\nyou pay a company to come out and\nthey take care of it.\n\n199\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.390\nHey we're not printing, right,\nthere's something wrong with the printer.\n\n200\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.610\nIt's not doing what we want.\n\n201\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.730\nCan you come out and fix it?\n\n202\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.030\nOr you might actually be the one\nmaking the service call.\n\n203\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.787\nNow when it comes to cleaning,\ncleaning the laser printer,\n\n204\n00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:44.673\nthey actually got something kinda cool.\n\n205\n00:09:44.673 --> 00:09:48.681\nLet me know show you this, laser printer\ncleaning sheets, believe it or not,\n\n206\n00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:50.577\nthat you can actually use out there.\n\n207\n00:09:50.577 --> 00:09:53.395\nAnd we'll go shopping again here,\nand let's see.\n\n208\n00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:56.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yeah.\n\n209\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.262\nSo Staples has got them, right,\nso we'll use Staples here, right.\n\n210\n00:09:59.262 --> 00:10:02.869\nAnd what they do is you feed them through\nthe laser, and again it allows them to\n\n211\n00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:06.327\nclean not just the printers,but you\ncan see all kinds of things, right.\n\n212\n00:10:06.327 --> 00:10:08.726\nCopiers, fax machines,\nthe feed rollers, right.\n\n213\n00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:12.299\nSo this is a good little kit, and again\nthey are relatively inexpensive, right.\n\n214\n00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:14.516\nSo you might have to clean them.\n\n215\n00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:19.230\nKeep in mind that you also have things\nlike your printer maintenance kit.\n\n216\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.830\nWhen we say printer maintenance kit,\nor I'm sorry, your vacuum, right.\n\n217\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.160\nAgain, you might have\nto vacuum out debris.\n\n218\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.050\nRemember that it should be an electronics\ntype vacuum because of the fact that\n\n219\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.420\nit doesn't give electrostatic discharge.\n\n220\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.190\nThe other thing that you want to\nbe mindful to is that in a lot of\n\n221\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.390\nthe bigger industrial type laser printers,\n\n222\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.880\nthey'll have onscreen displays\nthat they'll let you know.\n\n223\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.180\nAnd most of them will report when\nthe media is low, like paper if you will,\n\n224\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.540\nwhen the toner is low.\n\n225\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.810\nBut when you get things like paper jams,\nright, again sometimes they'll even have\n\n226\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.880\nonscreen clean display that will\nwalk you through a little tutorial\n\n227\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.455\nof which compartments and stuff to\nopen up, which handles to release.\n\n228\n00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:05.210\nBut if you feel that that's a little\nbit out of your wheelhouse,\n\n229\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.270\nremember troubleshooting theory says\nnever hesitate to escalate if you need.\n\n230\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.500\nAll right, so one of the other\nprinters that we talk about, right,\n\n231\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.000\nwe talk about thermal printers, right.\n\n232\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.580\nAnd thermal printers are another\ntype of printer that could\n\n233\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.260\noccasionally need cleaning, all right.\n\n234\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.516\nEvery one of these printers,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n235\n00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:27.260\ntalk about replacing paper, right, and\nthat's part of printer maintenance,\n\n236\n00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.638\nright [LAUGH] is that you could have\nto replace the media from time to time.\n\n237\n00:11:30.638 --> 00:11:31.990\nSo do keep that in mind too.\n\n238\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.730\nBut when it comes to a thermal printers,\n\n239\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.250\nright, they have heating\nelements inside of them.\n\n240\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.370\nAnd the heating elements can\nperiodically need cleaned, right.\n\n241\n00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.650\nWell why would we need to clean those?\n\n242\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.380\nWhat is on one of those heating elements,\nif you think about it,\n\n243\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.730\nthat we would really need to clean, right?\n\n244\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.020\nWell residue deposits.\n\n245\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.150\nThermal printers do get a little\nbit of residue that just builds up,\n\n246\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.170\nand occasionally it needs cleaned, right.\n\n247\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.900\nHere's the other thing, if you have\nthings like thermal labels, right,\n\n248\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.100\nit depends on what your media is, right.\n\n249\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.710\nWell you might have thermal labels, and\nwhen you print to the thermal labels,\n\n250\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.600\nthey have a little bit of adhesive, right.\n\n251\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.800\nAnd the adhesive stays behind, right,\nso you can get adhesive build up too.\n\n252\n00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.110\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And it could just be a basic dirt and\n\n253\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.839\ndebris, I mean that happens.\n\n254\n00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.530\nYou have to be mindful of\nthe printer location and\n\n255\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.058\nany environment that you're in because you\ncould get just a basic level of dirt and\n\n256\n00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:28.240\ndebris inside of these devices.\n\n257\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.340\nSo what are some of the things\nthat we can use, right?\n\n258\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.390\nWell one of the very easiest ones,\nand one of the most common,\n\n259\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.630\nto be on hand that doesn't require really\n\n260\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.340\na call to any special printer\nshop is rubbing alcohol, right.\n\n261\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.700\nRubbing alcohol is one of\nthe easiest ones that you can use.\n\n262\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.750\nBut they have other things too.\n\n263\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.850\nThey have things like cleaning cards,\n\n264\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.960\ncleaning cards clean\nthermal printers as well.\n\n265\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.991\nThey also have cleaning pens,\nlittle pens that you can do it.\n\n266\n00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:55.469\nNow I wouldn't be surprised\nif the pens don't have just\n\n267\n00:12:55.469 --> 00:12:56.385\nbasically-\n&gt;&gt; Rubbing alcohol.\n\n268\n00:12:56.385 --> 00:12:57.394\n&gt;&gt; Full of rubbing alcohol, right.\n\n269\n00:12:57.394 --> 00:13:02.876\nSo keep in mind Q-tips work too, right,\nbut tightly wound Q-tips, all right.\n\n270\n00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:04.220\nThat's one of the things.\n\n271\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.490\nNot probably just not your average Q-tip,\nthey're probably a little longer and\n\n272\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.330\nthey're tightly wound,\n\n273\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.890\nbecause of the fact that the Q-tip itself\ncan leave debris behind and then you're\n\n274\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.210\nreally not cleaning it, you're causing the\nproblem rather than solving the problem.\n\n275\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.680\nSo again, rubbing alcohol and\n\n276\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.935\na tightly wound Q-tip will work too,\nthey might just call them cleaning swabs.\n\n277\n00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n278\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, thermal printers can also have\n\n279\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.780\na built in print head cleaners,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n280\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.570\nThat could be built in at\nthe print head as well.\n\n281\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.990\nHowever, that usually doesn't apply to\nthe direct thermal printers, right.\n\n282\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.510\nThe direct thermal printers\nare the really common ones,\n\n283\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.500\nyou probably see on a daily basis\nwhether you realize it or not, right.\n\n284\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.250\nThese are the printers that are actually\nPoint of Sale systems, right.\n\n285\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.590\nIf you've ever gone to the gas station,\nwhich I'm sure some of you have, right,\n\n286\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.100\nand you pay at the pump, and\nyou print your receipt out.\n\n287\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.260\nWell that little receipt that\ncomes out of the machine there,\n\n288\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.240\nthat is your direct thermal printer.\n\n289\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.140\nThose printers use heated pins, so\n\n290\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.440\nsometimes they can get\ndebris on them as well.\n\n291\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.911\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just last night, I was at\na point of sale, they give me a receipt,\n\n292\n00:14:02.911 --> 00:14:03.656\nI can barely read it.\n\n293\n00:14:03.656 --> 00:14:05.582\nI said hey, your thermal printer\nmight need some maintenance.\n\n294\n00:14:05.582 --> 00:14:07.923\nAnd they just went like, eh?\n\n295\n00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:10.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n296\n00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:13.227\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I was being nice.\n\n297\n00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.010\n&gt;&gt; There you go, trying to help you out.\n\n298\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.603\nTell them to come over and watch ITProTV.\n\n299\n00:14:16.603 --> 00:14:17.754\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n300\n00:14:17.754 --> 00:14:21.450\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that that's one of\nthe reasons too that you can see, or\n\n301\n00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:25.476\none of the telltale signs that you can\nsee, that the thermal printer does\n\n302\n00:14:25.476 --> 00:14:29.490\nneed to be cleaned, right,\nwhen its output is sub par, right.\n\n303\n00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.260\nWhen you have one of the direct thermal\nprinters and you get like a faded image,\n\n304\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.436\nand I say faded,\nit's just it's kind of faint if you will.\n\n305\n00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:39.660\nIt's a tell-tale sign, again,\n\n306\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.670\nthat the pins themselves might not\nbe heating the paper appropriately.\n\n307\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.420\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n308\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n309\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.440\nsome of the things that I will tell you\nthough about the thermal printers that I\n\n310\n00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.780\nwant you to be aware of.\n\n311\n00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.310\nNever clean the print head\nwhile the printer's on.\n\n312\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.960\nNow again, some of this should seem\nobvious, right, I understand that.\n\n313\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.200\nBut when you look at a laser printer and\nyou're going to clean it you're actually\n\n314\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.910\ngoing to send a cleaning paper through it,\nright.\n\n315\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.742\nThe only way you can pull it\nthrough is for it to be on, right.\n\n316\n00:15:11.742 --> 00:15:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n317\n00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.380\n&gt;&gt; So with a laser printer,\nlet me also back up there, Zach, too,\n\n318\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.920\ncuz you gotta keep in mind that the laser\nprinters, be very careful cuz they have\n\n319\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.240\nwhat's known as an HVPS,\na high voltage power supply, right.\n\n320\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.970\nWe've got a laser that's powered in there,\n\n321\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.755\nwe've got heating assemblies,\nthe fusing rollers, right.\n\n322\n00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So they get very hot,\n\n323\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.540\nbe careful with those too.\n\n324\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.740\nSame thing goes, you got to be\ncareful of the thermals printers.\n\n325\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.550\nDo not clean the print head while\nthe thermal printer is on, all right.\n\n326\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.816\nUnlike when we say things like\ncleaning ink jets, right.\n\n327\n00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:44.580\nWhen we say cleaning ink jet printer.\n\n328\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.600\na little bit different, right.\n\n329\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.000\nBecause when you clean an inkjet printer,\n\n330\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.540\na lot of times all you're\ndoing is printing.\n\n331\n00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.285\nYou're just printing.\n\n332\n00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:51.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-huh.\n\n333\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.200\n&gt;&gt; Because it cleans the nozzles out,\nright.\n\n334\n00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.122\nSo be careful with a thermal printer\nbecause you want to turn it off when you\n\n335\n00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.030\nclean the print head.\n\n336\n00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.007\nThe other thing to keep in mind, too,\nis that the print head is very, very,\n\n337\n00:16:01.007 --> 00:16:01.953\nI say sensitive.\n\n338\n00:16:01.953 --> 00:16:04.870\nI don't know, don't mean that it's\nYou're gonna hurt its feelings, but\n\n339\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.250\nyou gotta be very careful, right?\n\n340\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.249\nYou don't wanna touch the printhead\nin any way, all right?\n\n341\n00:16:10.249 --> 00:16:15.750\nAgain, that could ruin\nthe whole printhead in general.\n\n342\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.580\nThe other thing that I want you\nto keep in mind is be careful and\n\n343\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.700\nbe mindful of what you're doing.\n\n344\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.990\nOne of the reasons you don't wanna\ntouch the printhead is cuz one\n\n345\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.300\nof the ways you could ruin\nit is by scratching it.\n\n346\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.630\nAll right, so\njust be very careful with that, right?\n\n347\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.020\nAll right, so\nhow about the impact printer, all right?\n\n348\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.270\nWell, the impact printer is one\nthat gets a lot of debris in it,\n\n349\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.890\nespecially when you look at\nthe tractor feed assemblies.\n\n350\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.650\nThe line printer is one of\nthe fastest impact printers,\n\n351\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.820\nif not the fastest impact printer.\n\n352\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.660\nSome of the other ones there, the form\ncharacter printers like the old Daisy\n\n353\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.760\nwheel printers, those are legacy devices.\n\n354\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.190\nYou could see some of those\nif you go out on YouTube,\n\n355\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.300\nyou could see them hooked up to\nApple computer, Macintosh, right?\n\n356\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.011\n[LAUGH] I wouldn't even say Apple IIe,\nI mean, Apple I.\n\n357\n00:17:00.011 --> 00:17:04.315\n[LAUGH] But anyways,\nthose are pretty much out of date.\n\n358\n00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.595\nHowever, you do have things like\nthe OKIA printers out there.\n\n359\n00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:10.700\nIf you've ever been to Mechanic Shop,\nright?\n\n360\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.850\nRemember, impact printers\naren't something that's legacy.\n\n361\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.750\nThey're used pretty heavily today, right?\n\n362\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:21.870\nBecause they're the best printer for\nmultilayered printing, right?\n\n363\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.960\nThink about carbon copy, all right?\n\n364\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.453\nA carbon copy is multilayered printing,\nand\n\n365\n00:17:26.453 --> 00:17:30.659\nthat's one of the reasons they keep\nthings like impact printers out there.\n\n366\n00:17:30.659 --> 00:17:34.670\nIn fact, let me see if I can find it.\n\n367\n00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:40.230\nIf I needed to replace one of these,\nright, we could look at OKIA data,\n\n368\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:45.160\nlet's see Microline,\nI got a couple of models\n\n369\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.270\nhere, 490 printhead, all right?\n\n370\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.990\nAnd there we go.\n\n371\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.390\nSo this is Buy Printers, right?\n\n372\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.620\nSo there we go, you might have\nto replace the printhead, right?\n\n373\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.558\nKeep that in mind.\n\n374\n00:17:57.558 --> 00:18:01.802\nYou remember that one of the things\nthat also you might have to replace is\n\n375\n00:18:01.802 --> 00:18:04.220\nthings like for instance, the ribbon.\n\n376\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.210\nIf it's an impact printer, right,\nyou might have the impact ribbon.\n\n377\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.956\nSo for instance, if I do, I don't know,\n\n378\n00:18:11.956 --> 00:18:16.579\nimpact printer ribbon, oops, robin.\n\n379\n00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:18.854\nI don't know what robin is,\nbut we'll try ribbon.\n\n380\n00:18:18.854 --> 00:18:20.389\n&gt;&gt; It's the father of ribbon.\n\n381\n00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:21.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n382\n00:18:21.713 --> 00:18:24.101\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead here and\n\n383\n00:18:24.101 --> 00:18:28.355\nsee if we can find one these ribbons and\nkinda show you it.\n\n384\n00:18:28.355 --> 00:18:33.785\nI'm not really seeing one here.\n\n385\n00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:34.960\nWell, there's one here.\n\n386\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.180\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll show you this one, right?\n\n387\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.500\nSo they're not very expensive.\n\n388\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.651\nBut you can see right here,\n\n389\n00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:42.368\none of the impact printers that\nuse in the ribbons here, right?\n\n390\n00:18:42.368 --> 00:18:43.923\nYou might have to replace these as well.\n\n391\n00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:46.303\nSo, that is something that\nhappens from time to time,\n\n392\n00:18:46.303 --> 00:18:48.290\nthat you're gonna have to replace, right?\n\n393\n00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.060\nThese go back to the days where a lot of\npeople don't even know about them anymore.\n\n394\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.943\nBecause we don't really see typewriters,\nright, where you have the old typewriters.\n\n395\n00:18:54.943 --> 00:18:56.358\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna say typewriters, yeah.\n\n396\n00:18:56.358 --> 00:18:59.323\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the old typewriter ribbons,\nbut again,\n\n397\n00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:01.648\nyou might still have to do this today.\n\n398\n00:19:01.648 --> 00:19:05.786\nThe other thing to keep in mind, too,\nis that not only replacing the ribbon,\n\n399\n00:19:05.786 --> 00:19:09.810\noccasionally, what you have to do\nis you get paper debris in there.\n\n400\n00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.010\nYou might have to vacuum it up.\n\n401\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.390\nAgain, remember your electronics vacuum,\n\n402\n00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:18.040\nbe mindful of the printhead assemblies,\nbe mindful of the ribbon in there.\n\n403\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.490\nBecause you don't wanna pull\ntoo much of the ribbon.\n\n404\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.370\nYou put some slack in the ribbon, and\n\n405\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.670\nit might be a little bit hard to get\nany of that slack out of that ribbon.\n\n406\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.069\nSo just be mindful of what you're doing\nwhen you are cleaning the impact printer.\n\n407\n00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.049\nAnd this is another one\nthat they call out,\n\n408\n00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:36.530\nthings as simple as replacing the paper,\nand that's of the other thing.\n\n409\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.461\nAs we've gone through the series, and\nwe talk about when you get into scenarios\n\n410\n00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:44.569\nwhere you have to just not just identify\na technology, but you have to troubleshoot\n\n411\n00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:48.637\nit, you have to maintain it, you have to\nrepair it, simple fixes first, right?\n\n412\n00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:51.900\nI don't have any printed output,\nwhat might I need to do?\n\n413\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.903\nRight, well, it might not be anything\nto do with the printhead assembly,\n\n414\n00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:59.777\nit might be as simple as replacing\nthe printhead, or not the printhead,\n\n415\n00:19:59.777 --> 00:20:02.310\nI'm sorry, the ribbon, all right?\n\n416\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.530\nDid you replace the paper itself, right?\n\n417\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.755\nSo keep that in mind, all right,\n\n418\n00:20:07.755 --> 00:20:12.330\nthat could be something that you\nneed to do as well, all right.\n\n419\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.632\nLast but not least,\nwe have the one of the most common and\n\n420\n00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:19.585\npopular printers out there,\nand that's the inkjet printer.\n\n421\n00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now, with the inkjet printer,\n\n422\n00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.436\nthere's a few things that have to\nhappen to it, occasionally, all right?\n\n423\n00:20:24.436 --> 00:20:27.520\nRemember in an earlier episode\nwhen we're talking about printers,\n\n424\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.923\none of the things that we mentioned is\nthat there's a couple different types\n\n425\n00:20:30.923 --> 00:20:33.601\nof printhead assemblies inside\nof these inkjet printers.\n\n426\n00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:37.110\nAnd one of the most common and\nleast expensive is where the printhead and\n\n427\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.880\nthe cartridge are all one thing.\n\n428\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.410\nSo if the cartridge fails or\nthe cartridge is out,\n\n429\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:46.040\nwe just pull the cartridge out and\nmake sure that I get the ink cartridge.\n\n430\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.030\nThe right ink cartridge for the printer\nusually has a little numeric code on it\n\n431\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.380\nthat you can match up with the printer,\nand then I replace the cartridge.\n\n432\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.800\nAnd in doing so, I am also\nreplacing the printhead assembly.\n\n433\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.620\nNow, those type of inkjet printers\nare a little bit less expensive.\n\n434\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:08.100\nHowever, keep in mind that every time\nyou replace the ink cartridge, printhead\n\n435\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.990\nassembly by association, you gotta have\nto do some calibration to it, right?\n\n436\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.596\nNow the calibration is just as easy as,\na lot of times,\n\n437\n00:21:15.596 --> 00:21:18.386\nyou'll have software that\ngoes along with your printer.\n\n438\n00:21:18.386 --> 00:21:20.193\nAnd you do a calibration and you click it.\n\n439\n00:21:20.193 --> 00:21:22.453\nAnd what it does is it\nrealign everything and\n\n440\n00:21:22.453 --> 00:21:25.704\nit makes sure that your colors\nare doing just fine, all right?\n\n441\n00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:29.307\nNow the other thing that could\nhappen too is that you need to,\n\n442\n00:21:29.307 --> 00:21:33.420\nwith an inkjet printer,\nthe nozzles can get clogged up, all right?\n\n443\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.510\nI think it's a billionth of a drop or\nmaybe it's a millionth of a normal sized\n\n444\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:42.960\ndrop of water is how big the droplets are\nthat are coming out of that inkjet nozzle.\n\n445\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.650\nAnd that means that just any little\nbit of debris gets in there,\n\n446\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.000\nit can get clogged, all right?\n\n447\n00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.915\nSo one of the ways that you can\nmaintain an inkjet printer is just to,\n\n448\n00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:55.744\nevery once in awhile, print from it,\neven if you don't need to.\n\n449\n00:21:55.744 --> 00:21:57.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz it dries up.\n\n450\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.490\n&gt;&gt; It does, exactly.\n\n451\n00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.020\nThe other thing too that\nyou might have to do,\n\n452\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.980\nyou might have to clear\na jam from time to time.\n\n453\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.835\nAnd really,\nthat's another one of those ones,\n\n454\n00:22:03.835 --> 00:22:06.020\nit's almost synonymous with\nall the printers right there.\n\n455\n00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.291\nYou've got feed assemblies and\n\n456\n00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:10.150\nthey're pulling paper through\nthe pooling media through.\n\n457\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.915\nAnd hopefully,\nyou get your printed output.\n\n458\n00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.635\nBut occasionally, the tractor feeds,\n\n459\n00:22:13.635 --> 00:22:17.125\nthe friction feed assembly sometimes,\nthey don't pull the paper right.\n\n460\n00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:22.082\nOr sometimes it's just not put\nin the media tray appropriately.\n\n461\n00:22:22.082 --> 00:22:25.511\nOr maybe you don't have the sizing right,\nand don't have it adjusted for\n\n462\n00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.155\nwhatever media you're printing to and\nyou get jammed.\n\n463\n00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:31.530\nSo sometimes you do have\nto clear the jams out.\n\n464\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.390\nThat is just another one of those things,\ntoo.\n\n465\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.070\nSo remember,\ncleaning the heads is just as simple as,\n\n466\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:41.320\nthey do have inkjet head cleaners.\n\n467\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.240\nBut it could just be as simple as\njust printing once in a while, right?\n\n468\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.580\nBecause the fact that they\ncan dry out like Zach said.\n\n469\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.365\nReplacing the cartridges, again, remember\nif you're replacing the cartridges you\n\n470\n00:22:52.365 --> 00:22:55.230\nwanna ensure that you follow\nwhatever the numeric code is.\n\n471\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:00.527\nI've seen a lot of them today that almost,\nthat when the output tray is open,\n\n472\n00:23:00.527 --> 00:23:05.499\nor actually when the printhead cart tray,\nI keep saying printhead, but\n\n473\n00:23:05.499 --> 00:23:10.332\nthe cartridge tray is open,\nyou'll see things like a little QR code.\n\n474\n00:23:10.332 --> 00:23:14.901\nAnd not only a numerical number but a\nlittle QR, a quick response code that you\n\n475\n00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:18.780\ntake your phone out and you can just\nget a picture of it real quick.\n\n476\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.080\nAnd it'll send you right out to a place\nthat you can buy refills if you need to.\n\n477\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.495\nWell, that's up to you.\n\n478\n00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:28.535\nJust make sure you pay attention to\nthe model because they are not the same.\n\n479\n00:23:28.535 --> 00:23:33.030\nAnybody who's been to any kind of office\nsupply type store who has looked down\n\n480\n00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.014\nthe aisle of printhead,\nI keep saying printhead.\n\n481\n00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:39.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Inkjet cartridges, yeah, thank you.\n\n482\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.918\nInkjet cartridges, knows that there's\nusually two or three shelves, and\n\n483\n00:23:42.918 --> 00:23:46.808\nthey're as long as the whole, entire\naisle, so you do have to pay attention.\n\n484\n00:23:46.808 --> 00:23:49.644\nAlso pay attention to whether\nit's the black cartridge, or\n\n485\n00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:51.097\nthe color cartridges as well.\n\n486\n00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:56.743\nBecause, obviously, that you wanna make\nsure that you get the right cartridge.\n\n487\n00:23:56.743 --> 00:23:58.073\nAnd the other thing too,\n\n488\n00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:01.695\nis to pay attention to any communication\nthat the printer is doing.\n\n489\n00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:04.178\nWith your computer.\n\n490\n00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:07.420\nA lot of times, you see those levels,\nbe proactive don't be reactive.\n\n491\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.730\nDon't wait until you're\ncompletely out of whatever.\n\n492\n00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:14.145\nIf you're always printing to black and\nwhite, don't wait until you're almost out\n\n493\n00:24:14.145 --> 00:24:17.195\nor wait till you get faded\nimages to replace the cartridge.\n\n494\n00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:22.025\nI know with them being as expensive as\nthey are people are gonna try to get every\n\n495\n00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:23.485\nlast little dime out of them.\n\n496\n00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:26.905\nBut again, if you're in a production\nenvironment where you rely on that\n\n497\n00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:33.015\nprinter, you might not be able to\nget ink cartridges right away.\n\n498\n00:24:33.015 --> 00:24:36.055\nYou might have to wait a little bit so\nbe a little bit more proactive and\n\n499\n00:24:36.055 --> 00:24:39.800\nagain, remember on the exam,\nsimple fixes first.\n\n500\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.080\nThe laser toner, the big thing is making\nsure that you're replacing the toner,\n\n501\n00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.530\napply your maintenance kit,\ncalibration and cleaning.\n\n502\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.500\nThermal printers, remember to\nreplace the paper when you need to.\n\n503\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.550\nNow remember, that's the other thing, too.\n\n504\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:58.000\nWhen it comes to replacing the thermal\nprinter paper, it's a thermal paper.\n\n505\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.620\nIt is reactive to heat, it is a special\npaper that you need to put through there.\n\n506\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.520\nDon't just be putting any generic media\nthrough there or you can cause a fire.\n\n507\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.440\nWe have special thermal paper for that, so\n\n508\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.330\nalso make sure that you're\nusing the right paper too.\n\n509\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.930\nBe careful and mindful of the point head\nassemblies inside of the thermal printer.\n\n510\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.130\nTurn them off when\nyou're cleaning them and\n\n511\n00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.080\ndon't touch the print\nhead assembly itself.\n\n512\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.800\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Impact printers, replace the ribbon.\n\n513\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.390\nThat happens, so you need to do that.\n\n514\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.360\nReplace the print head.\n\n515\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.880\nThey can be expensive,\nbut be careful with them.\n\n516\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.140\nReplace the paper.\n\n517\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:29.850\nInkjet printer,\n\n518\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:35.160\nagain, clean the heads, replace the\ncartridges, do calibration if you need to.\n\n519\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.916\nCalibration with me is a love-hate\nrelationship because when you spend 70,\n\n520\n00:25:38.916 --> 00:25:42.741\n80 bucks on your print head cartridges and\nwhat do you do when you calibrate it?\n\n521\n00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:45.177\nYou waste your age.\n\n522\n00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:46.876\nYou're using your age.\n\n523\n00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:49.731\nBoy, that's a good market for\njob security for you but\n\n524\n00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:52.225\nit's something that\nsometimes has to be done.\n\n525\n00:25:52.225 --> 00:25:55.801\nAnd last but not least, remember that\nwith any of the printers really,\n\n526\n00:25:55.801 --> 00:25:59.200\nthat the friction feed assemblies or\nthe tractor feed assemblies,\n\n527\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.127\nif it happens to be an impact printer.\n\n528\n00:26:01.127 --> 00:26:04.987\nIf they don't pull the media in right,\nit's gonna cause a jam.\n\n529\n00:26:04.987 --> 00:26:09.580\nMake sure that you very easily\nclear those paper jams out.\n\n530\n00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.830\nRemember you don't wanna just pull the\npaper out because you can strip the gears\n\n531\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.510\nand the stepper motors that are inside\nof it, so be careful when you do that.\n\n532\n00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.410\nIf you can remember some\nof these scenarios and\n\n533\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.740\nyou can apply some of these techniques\nthat we're telling you here,\n\n534\n00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.920\nyou should be sitting well for\nthat A plus exam.\n\n535\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.370\n&gt;&gt; Wes, thanks for sharing,\ngreat job as usual.\n\n536\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.080\nPrinter maintenance inside of CompTIA

everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:16.775\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:18.005\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:22.415\nAnd in today's episode, I'm so glad to be\nhere because we're kicking off more of our\n\n10\n00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:25.620\nA+ series going through\nthe 220-901 specifically.\n\n11\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.851\nAnd of course joining us\nback in the studio yet\n\n12\n00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:31.630\nagain, lending his expertise on that\ntopic, our good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.580\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.350\nHow's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.057\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n16\n00:00:35.057 --> 00:00:38.062\nJust when we thought we\nwere done with connections,\n\n17\n00:00:38.062 --> 00:00:41.424\nwe've got a few different types\nthat we gotta talk about.\n\n18\n00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:45.609\nAnd that's really what we're gonna be\naddressing in this issue, I don't know.\n\n19\n00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:46.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:47.799\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This issue of this magazine in\n\n21\n00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:48.427\nthis episode.\n\n22\n00:00:48.427 --> 00:00:49.729\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:50.872\n&gt;&gt; In earlier episodes,\n\n24\n00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:53.338\nwe talked about things\nlike PC connections, and\n\n25\n00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:57.490\nI really kept some of the connections\nseparate because, they fall under a class,\n\n26\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.793\nwe still make connections\nto the computers.\n\n27\n00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:03.243\nBut, however, they're really\ndealing with the network and\n\n28\n00:01:03.243 --> 00:01:05.245\nnetwork communications, right.\n\n29\n00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:09.446\nWhen we talk about network communications,\nessentially, what we are talking about is\n\n30\n00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:12.298\nsending our data from internally\nin the computer, right.\n\n31\n00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:16.100\nInternally, we talk about communicating\nacross the motherboard, in and\n\n32\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.475\nout of CPUs, memory, and storage devices.\n\n33\n00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:22.506\nAnd now what we're doing is we're talking\nabout is sending that information\n\n34\n00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:26.724\nexternally, over some kind of media,\nat the very least between two endpoints,\n\n35\n00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:28.655\na source and destination.\n\n36\n00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.975\nAnd the types of connections we make\nis gonna be important on the exam.\n\n37\n00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.062\nYou're gonna have to be aware of it.\n\n38\n00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:41.043\nNow, there are a few different types of\ncommunications that we can make, right?\n\n39\n00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:43.176\nThere's what's known as bounded media,\nand and\n\n40\n00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:45.627\nthere's what's known as unbounded media,\nall right.\n\n41\n00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:48.988\nLet's go ahead, and I want to get\nunbounded media out of the way here for\n\n42\n00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:49.716\njust a second,\n\n43\n00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:53.600\nbecause we're gonna talk about something\nknown as wireless in another episode.\n\n44\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.712\nBut when we talk about unbounded media,\nwe're talking about radiated connections,\n\n45\n00:01:57.712 --> 00:02:00.203\nright, we're not talking\nabout physical cables.\n\n46\n00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.860\nSo in this episode, what we're\ntalking about is bounded medium.\n\n47\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.800\nTalk about bounded medium,\nwe've got some kind of physical media,\n\n48\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.970\nif you will, that makes a connection\nbetween a two devices, right.\n\n49\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.185\nWhether that be a network connectivity\ndevice, whether that be a danum my laptop\n\n50\n00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:21.820\nappear that is connected,\nif you will to the network via a cable.\n\n51\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.480\nNow when we talk about cable connections,\n\n52\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.920\nthere are typically two different mediums,\nif you will.\n\n53\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.690\nThere's what's known as\ncopper bounded media,\n\n54\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.720\nand there's what's known\nas optical bounded media.\n\n55\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.318\nRight, when we talk about copper based\nmedia, what we're talking about is\n\n56\n00:02:36.318 --> 00:02:40.590\nan electromagnetic energy is sent\nacross some kind of copper conductor.\n\n57\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.812\nWhen we talk about an optical connection,\nwhat we talk about is an optical light\n\n58\n00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:48.290\nsource for the data that is sent\nover some kind of optical medium.\n\n59\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.260\nWe're gonna ahead and what we will do is,\nwe will dive into optical first.\n\n60\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.480\nWe're gonna to talk about what\nis known as, well, fiber optics.\n\n61\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.850\nSome of you, I'm sure,\nalready know what fiber optics are.\n\n62\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.410\nYou probably see it, whether it is\non the television out there, or\n\n63\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.010\nwhether you have been\nsurfing the Internet.\n\n64\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.230\nYou probably seen the concept\nof fiber optics communication.\n\n65\n00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.370\nNow, one of the great\nthings about fiber optics,\n\n66\n00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.970\nwell, there's a few things that\nare good about fiber optics, all right.\n\n67\n00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.530\nAnd then there's something that's not so\ngreat about fiber optics, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.360\nFiber optics, one of the great things is,\nit's one of the fastest,\n\n69\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.430\nis the fastest bounded transmission\nmedia we have on the planet.\n\n70\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.183\n&gt;&gt; It's quick\n&gt;&gt; It's really quick and\n\n71\n00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.970\nyou, Dan, it's kind of interesting,\nbecause it's so\n\n72\n00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.815\nquick that even the devices\nthat send the communication,\n\n73\n00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:34.379\ncan't put all the data on a fiber\noptic cable to completely saturate it.\n\n74\n00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.288\nNow, when you multitudes of\ncomputer can certainly do that.\n\n75\n00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:42.859\nBut, we still have a little bit\nin the technology before we\n\n76\n00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.498\ncan really saturate\nthe amount of bandwidth,\n\n77\n00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:51.463\nright, the capacity of that\ntransmission media completely.\n\n78\n00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:55.217\nNow when we talk about fiber optic cables,\nagain,\n\n79\n00:03:55.217 --> 00:03:58.722\nwe're talking about\nan optical light source.\n\n80\n00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:01.980\nIn some cases,\nyou could see LEDs were used.\n\n81\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.110\nAgain, fiber optics commonly\ntoday are lasers are used, and\n\n82\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.090\nlasers are used because they have\na very long transmission distance.\n\n83\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.370\nNow I talked about transmission distances,\nand when we look at transmission\n\n84\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.740\ndistances, it's really based on\nthe type of cable that you have.\n\n85\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.658\nYou have some cable types, if you will,\nthat support transmission distances up\n\n86\n00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:25.233\nto 40 kilometers, right,\nwe're talking about 40,000 meters.\n\n87\n00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:30.157\nSo much so that they are what form\nthe basis for whats known as, for instance\n\n88\n00:04:30.157 --> 00:04:35.970\nlets say, some of our Europeans SMEs that\ncome in here from across the pond, right.\n\n89\n00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.550\nThey actually connect continents together,\nright,\n\n90\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.840\nlike the transatlantic cabling is\nactually done with this type of medium.\n\n91\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.900\nBut there's also fiber optic\ncables that are typically, again,\n\n92\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.200\nstill the same concept as in high band\nwidth, but they're internal to a building.\n\n93\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.091\nLet's go ahead and\ntalk about the different types.\n\n94\n00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:56.820\nThese are what are known as mode types,\nand you have two different modes.\n\n95\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.387\nYou have what's known as single mode,\nand you have what's known as multi-mode.\n\n96\n00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.080\nNow, let's go ahead, and\n\n97\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.220\nlet's take a look at a diagram of\nwhat multi-mode is, all right.\n\n98\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.944\nWhen we talk about multi-mode\ncommunications, I want you to know that\n\n99\n00:05:09.944 --> 00:05:13.497\nthe data is sent over the medium\nin multiple light sources, right.\n\n100\n00:05:13.497 --> 00:05:17.540\nYou have multiple light sources\nwithin the interior of the cable.\n\n101\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.210\nNow the cable's interesting,\nbecause it's made up of a few things.\n\n102\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.100\nIt's made up of typically a glass core,\nright,\n\n103\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.170\nand the core itself is what the light\nsource goes down, all right?\n\n104\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.930\nNow in multi-mode cores, I want you to\nknow there's something specific to them,\n\n105\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.484\nand that is that they are 50 or\n62.5 microns.\n\n106\n00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:41.463\nI had to be careful saying that, because\nwhen I first started teaching this, I\n\n107\n00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:46.900\nwould say 50 to 62.5 microns in diameter,\nand it's not an in between thing.\n\n108\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.096\nYou have 50, or you have 62.5.\n\n109\n00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:52.060\nNow, what the heck is a micron?\n\n110\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.520\n[LAUGH] A micron is\na millionth of a meter.\n\n111\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.919\nSo we're talking very small, all right.\n\n112\n00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.941\nNow, the outer diameter of this cable,\nwhich the outer diameter is\n\n113\n00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:07.656\nthe protective coating that's around the\noutside, that is 125 microns in diameter.\n\n114\n00:06:07.656 --> 00:06:09.299\nAnd the great thing to\nunderstand about this,\n\n115\n00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:11.270\ndoesn't matter if it's single mode or\nmulti-mode.\n\n116\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.703\nThe diameter on the outside is the same.\n\n117\n00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:17.780\nNow, around that core, you have\nwhat's known as reflective cladding.\n\n118\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.890\nAll right, now reflective cladding is\nwhat allows the cable to actually bounce\n\n119\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.660\nthe signal internally within the glass\ncore across the transmission medium.\n\n120\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.300\nIt uses something known as\ntotal internal refraction.\n\n121\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.757\nThat's just a reflection bounces off,\n\n122\n00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:34.581\nrefraction keeps it\nwithin the cable itself.\n\n123\n00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.392\nAnd then around the reflective cladding,\nyou have strengthening fibers, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:38.392 --> 00:06:40.322\nWhen we talk about strengthening fibers,\n\n125\n00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:44.345\nthey're important because of the fact that\nthe microns' diameters that we're talking\n\n126\n00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:46.830\nabout with that glass core\nthat's in the middle of it.\n\n127\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.682\nNow the other thing I want you to keep in\nmind, that with multi-mode communications,\n\n128\n00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:52.500\nthe distances are shorter, all right.\n\n129\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.320\nNow, why are the distance is shorter?\n\n130\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.120\nWell, I want you to think of\na garden hose, all right.\n\n131\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.585\nIf I have a garden hose that\nis 3 inches in diameter, and\n\n132\n00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:04.580\nI'm pumping water out of it, right, I have\n\n133\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.540\nto put a lot of pressure in there to get\nthat water to come out really great.\n\n134\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.808\nBut If you take the same\namount of pressure, and\n\n135\n00:07:10.808 --> 00:07:14.039\nyou put that in a garden hose that\nis a half inch in diameter, right,\n\n136\n00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.975\ndid you ever put your finger over the hose\nwhen you where a kid and it sprays faster?\n\n137\n00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:19.434\nThat's kind of like a single mode.\n\n138\n00:07:19.434 --> 00:07:23.220\nSo there are some things to keep in\nmind that because the core isn't\n\n139\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.860\nultra concentrated, like single motives\nthat we'll talk about in a second,\n\n140\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.920\nthe transmission distances\nare a lot shorter, right.\n\n141\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.260\nSo, we have multi-mode.\n\n142\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.790\nYou could see multi-mode and\nsingle mode within buildings, so\n\n143\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.610\ndon't let me fool you there.\n\n144\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.290\nWe have single mode cables\nthat we use in here as well.\n\n145\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.789\nBut as far as the overall range goes,\nyou're talking typically,\n\n146\n00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.531\nno greater than 550 meters, right?\n\n147\n00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.450\nAnother common one is 330 meters,\nI'm not sure exactly why.\n\n148\n00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.220\nI'm sure there's some science behind it.\n\n149\n00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.575\nWell beyond the scope of this exam and\nmy brain.\n\n150\n00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:59.695\n[LAUGH] But I can shorter transition\ndistances is important to remember there.\n\n151\n00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:03.019\nNow we also have what's\nknown as single mode.\n\n152\n00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:04.306\n&gt;&gt; This is the big daddy.\n\n153\n00:08:04.306 --> 00:08:06.322\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\nThat's going back to what we were talking\n\n154\n00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:08.113\nabout connecting continents-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n155\n00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:11.539\n&gt;&gt; Together, right?\nWe're talking up to 40 kilometers in\n\n156\n00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:12.804\na single cable.\n\n157\n00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:16.055\nAnd then when you put repeaters\nthat can help extend the signal.\n\n158\n00:08:16.055 --> 00:08:20.859\nI mean this is essentially what happens\nwhen we have a network operation center\n\n159\n00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:23.208\ndown in Florida, down here in Miami.\n\n160\n00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:26.832\nOr the ones that are like in New York\nthat literally tie the continents\n\n161\n00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:27.845\ntogether, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:27.845 --> 00:08:30.173\nNow when we say single mode,\n\n163\n00:08:30.173 --> 00:08:35.025\nwell let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the diameters here.\n\n164\n00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:39.825\nNow, we're talking down to 9 microns,\n9 millions of a meter in diameter.\n\n165\n00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:42.320\nAnd again they call it singlemode\nbecause its a single light source.\n\n166\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.524\nAgain its fired kinda like a rifle shot\nand across here straight down that cable.\n\n167\n00:08:46.524 --> 00:08:51.174\nAnd there really isn't any bouncing or\nrefraction like you see in multi-mode.\n\n168\n00:08:51.174 --> 00:08:57.153\nAll right, these are extremely\nlarge long distance connections.\n\n169\n00:08:57.153 --> 00:09:00.214\nAnd it really is one of the ones that's\nabout the fastest transmission speed that\n\n170\n00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:00.760\nyou'll see.\n\n171\n00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.409\nIn fact, they use these things\nas you move into network plus,\n\n172\n00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:08.424\nyou'll learn about things like\nsynchronous optical networking.\n\n173\n00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:11.619\nAnd that's how ISPs tie\ntheir networks together and\n\n174\n00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:17.420\nbring them into your house locally if you\nwill, for residential communications.\n\n175\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.620\nNow I'd like to take a second, we've\nactually got an example of some fiber\n\n176\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.369\noptic cables here that I'd like\nyou guys to take a look at, right?\n\n177\n00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:28.388\nOne of the ones that I have here,\nDan I kinda broke this.\n\n178\n00:09:28.388 --> 00:09:29.773\nDan was like what are-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:30.439\n&gt;&gt; These pieces here.\n\n180\n00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:33.803\nAnd I decided to leave them up here\nbecause what I was trying to do is\n\n181\n00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:35.895\nshow you the interior of the cable here.\n\n182\n00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:39.310\nAnd there's not really much you\ncan see because of the fact that\n\n183\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.130\nthis is single mode cable.\n\n184\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.524\nAnd that's why don't think we're\nyou won't find this inside of\n\n185\n00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:49.409\nyour communication networks or\nclosets within your system.\n\n186\n00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:54.346\nIn fact, this goes to one of the switches\nwe have inside of our closet too.\n\n187\n00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:55.885\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Not anymore.\n\n188\n00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:57.056\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not anymore,\n\n189\n00:09:57.056 --> 00:09:57.946\nthat's right, that's funny.\n\n190\n00:09:57.946 --> 00:10:01.192\nBecause one of our other hosts that's\nworked in networks for a very long time,\n\n191\n00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:01.692\nDon Pezet.\n\n192\n00:10:01.692 --> 00:10:06.220\nActually, I was in a show with him when\nhe cut this, and when he cut this,\n\n193\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.166\nI was like, did you just that?\n\n194\n00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:08.746\n10 years ago,\n\n195\n00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:11.160\nyou wouldn't have cut a fiber optic\ncable just in the sheer expense.\n\n196\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.100\nAnd that's one of the drawbacks,\nI said about the only drawback that you\n\n197\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.230\nhave that's not so good is that fiber\noptics can be very expensive cables.\n\n198\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.650\nThis is single mode, and notice that\nwe have this protective coating, right?\n\n199\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.566\nThat's gonna be what has the 125\nmicron diameter on the outside of it.\n\n200\n00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:30.961\nThen we have, you can't really see it,\nthere's a glass core in here.\n\n201\n00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:32.877\nAnd like I said guys,\nI tried to strip that off.\n\n202\n00:10:32.877 --> 00:10:35.359\nYou can see,\n[LAUGH] I didn't do too good too well.\n\n203\n00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:36.120\n&gt;&gt; It does look a little brittle.\n\n204\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is very brittle,\nyou're absolutely correct.\n\n205\n00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:41.441\nIn fact you can kinda break it off,\nyou can feel it breaking there.\n\n206\n00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.848\nSo you wanna be very careful\nwith these cables for sure.\n\n207\n00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:46.215\nThat's not something you wanna\nplay tug of war on, right?\n\n208\n00:10:46.215 --> 00:10:48.005\nWe don't stretch these cables at all.\n\n209\n00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:50.246\nBut then notice that you also\nhave the strengthening fibers.\n\n210\n00:10:50.246 --> 00:10:55.203\nWell this is just for\na single communication channel, right?\n\n211\n00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:59.081\nThis is what's known as a full duplex\ncommunication in the fact that it sends\n\n212\n00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:00.670\nsignal down one fiber strand.\n\n213\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.519\nAnd it receives communications\ndown the other fiber strand.\n\n214\n00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:09.136\nI also wanna mention the connectors\nthat you'll see here,\n\n215\n00:11:09.136 --> 00:11:12.355\nthis one right here is whats\nknown as a LC connector.\n\n216\n00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.065\nI've heard this called\nmany different things,\n\n217\n00:11:14.065 --> 00:11:15.595\nI've heard it called local contact.\n\n218\n00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:19.216\nI've heard it called more commonly\nthe Lucent connector, again just LC.\n\n219\n00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:24.826\nAnd this one right here is what's\nknown as the ST connector.\n\n220\n00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:31.476\nThe ST connector is called, and\nlet me make sure I get that right, the ST.\n\n221\n00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:34.637\nI'm gonna I'll look at my own notes here\nand make sure that I have those right.\n\n222\n00:11:34.637 --> 00:11:35.739\nYou know what?\n\n223\n00:11:35.739 --> 00:11:37.485\nI did get that wrong,\nit's the SC connector.\n\n224\n00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:39.970\nThis is the subscriber connector.\n\n225\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.270\nThe other one is straight tipped, and\nwe'll look at that one here in a second.\n\n226\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.760\nNow what are the differences\nbetween these?\n\n227\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.121\nNothing, really [LAUGH] other\nthan the diameter themselves.\n\n228\n00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:49.437\nSee, in the earlier days,\n\n229\n00:11:49.437 --> 00:11:52.529\nto have one of these connections\ninside of your server closets,\n\n230\n00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:56.611\ninside of your enterprise environments\nwas very, very expensive per connection.\n\n231\n00:11:56.611 --> 00:12:01.518\nWell the problem is, with these\nearlier SC or subscriber connectors,\n\n232\n00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:06.031\nwhat you would do is, I don't know\nif I can do this on camera here.\n\n233\n00:12:06.031 --> 00:12:08.150\nBut you put these together, right?\n\n234\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.651\nThe problem here is that they\ndon't have a great port density.\n\n235\n00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:13.285\nAnd that's because in the earlier days,\nit was so expensive.\n\n236\n00:12:13.285 --> 00:12:17.046\nYou didn't have a lot of these connected\nwithout a massive expense on the device\n\n237\n00:12:17.046 --> 00:12:18.518\nthat they're connecting to.\n\n238\n00:12:18.518 --> 00:12:20.337\nBut that's changed, right?\n\n239\n00:12:20.337 --> 00:12:25.668\nAnd what happens is that they\nreplaced this with the LC connector.\n\n240\n00:12:25.668 --> 00:12:29.428\nBecause if you'll notice, and again\nI don't know if I can separate these,\n\n241\n00:12:29.428 --> 00:12:31.190\nprobably not.\n\n242\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.097\nBut you can separate these right here,\nmuch the same way this is.\n\n243\n00:12:35.097 --> 00:12:38.920\nBut notice the size of them, right?\n\n244\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.525\nAnd what the LC connectors use today or\nthe LC connector, so yeah,\n\n245\n00:12:43.525 --> 00:12:46.086\nlocal contact, lucent connector.\n\n246\n00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:47.585\nIt gives you a greater port density,\nright?\n\n247\n00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:51.521\nI can put a lot more of these into\na connectivity device than I could\n\n248\n00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.180\nthe earlier SC connector.\n\n249\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.228\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you're\nabout getting two to one.\n\n250\n00:12:55.228 --> 00:12:56.794\n&gt;&gt; You really are, absolutely.\n\n251\n00:12:56.794 --> 00:13:00.295\nYeah, in fact, Dan's absolutely right.\n\n252\n00:13:00.295 --> 00:13:03.439\nLook at that right there.\nSo again, it's really about port density,\n\n253\n00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:07.292\nand for a long time as they were\nmaking a transition from the SC or\n\n254\n00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:11.529\nthe subscriber connector to the lucent or\nlocal contact connector.\n\n255\n00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:14.005\nYou can see that this cable is\nactually for interoperability.\n\n256\n00:13:14.005 --> 00:13:18.994\nAgain, and\nthat's why you have two different types of\n\n257\n00:13:18.994 --> 00:13:22.365\nconnectors on the same cable there.\n\n258\n00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:26.113\nNow this is for single connections, right?\n\n259\n00:13:26.113 --> 00:13:29.780\nHowever if you're doing industrial\ntype fiber optics cables.\n\n260\n00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.656\nWhat you'll see here, and\nI dont know if you guys can see that,\n\n261\n00:13:32.656 --> 00:13:34.519\nbut there's multiple fibers, right?\n\n262\n00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:37.591\nYou still have the same thing, you've\ngot kind of like this hair piece going\n\n263\n00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:38.504\non here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n264\n00:13:38.504 --> 00:13:39.138\n&gt;&gt; In the background, right?\n\n265\n00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:40.790\nWith the strengthening fibers.\n\n266\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:45.912\nAnd you can usually tell them, most of the\ncables that we talk about really aren't,\n\n267\n00:13:45.912 --> 00:13:48.450\nthese are kind of common with the yellow.\n\n268\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.875\nBut that blue, that's kind of like\nan industry wide standard, if you will for\n\n269\n00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.160\nfiber optic cabling.\n\n270\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.560\nSo do keep that in mind, but notice that\nthere are multiple cores here, right?\n\n271\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.913\nAnd that's gonna be important,\n\n272\n00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:02.628\nbecause if you're gonna spend\nthe money on running fiber optics.\n\n273\n00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:05.481\nYou wanna be able to have,\nnot just run a single cable,\n\n274\n00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:07.977\nespecially when you talk\nabout sheer expense.\n\n275\n00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:11.619\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, do the tips make any\ndifference when it comes to single versus\n\n276\n00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:12.429\nmulti-mode?\n\n277\n00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:15.041\nDoes that an indication or does it matter?\n\n278\n00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:16.643\nIs it all about the actual?\n\n279\n00:14:16.643 --> 00:14:19.147\n&gt;&gt; It's about the cable,\nbut the fibers inside.\n\n280\n00:14:19.147 --> 00:14:20.091\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n281\n00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.475\nIt's about really the fibers inside, and\n\n282\n00:14:21.475 --> 00:14:23.559\nI'm sure there's gonna be\na commonality of one over the other.\n\n283\n00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:27.188\nBut again that's a little bit beyond\nthe scope of the exam, and honestly,\n\n284\n00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:29.675\nI hate to say this I'm not\nexactly sure on that one.\n\n285\n00:14:29.675 --> 00:14:34.290\nBut more than anything, you're gonna see\nfor instance in your single mode fibers,\n\n286\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.718\ninside of your server closets, you'll\ndefinitely see that SC connector a lot.\n\n287\n00:14:38.718 --> 00:14:42.874\nNow I did mention one other one that I\nkind of got a little bit wrong there.\n\n288\n00:14:42.874 --> 00:14:45.820\nAnd that's the ST connector,\nI got a diagram or\n\n289\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.966\nit's a pictures here of each one.\n\n290\n00:14:47.966 --> 00:14:49.034\nAnd we can kind of zoom in,\n\n291\n00:14:49.034 --> 00:14:51.374\ngive you guys a chance to see\nit a little bit better right.\n\n292\n00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:54.449\nThat's the SC connector that we looked at,\nthat's the bigger one.\n\n293\n00:14:54.449 --> 00:14:57.084\nIt's again still out there,\nit's not like it's going by the wayside.\n\n294\n00:14:57.084 --> 00:15:00.822\nBut again it's been largely\nreplaced by the LC connector, and\n\n295\n00:15:00.822 --> 00:15:02.737\nagain if we kinda zoom in there.\n\n296\n00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:05.073\nYou can kind of see what's going\non there and like Dan said,\n\n297\n00:15:05.073 --> 00:15:06.065\nit really is a two to one.\n\n298\n00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:08.063\nSo it's greater port density, and ports,\n\n299\n00:15:08.063 --> 00:15:10.590\nwe mean plugging into\nthe connectivity device.\n\n300\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.410\nWe can get twice as many of these\non a single blade than we could\n\n301\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.190\nthe earlier LC connector.\n\n302\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.950\nNow there's another one\nthat's out there too, and\n\n303\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.152\nthis is kind of an older connector.\n\n304\n00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:20.423\nAnd this is one I was calling,\nI kept saying ST.\n\n305\n00:15:20.423 --> 00:15:24.579\nThat's standard tip or straight tip,\nstraight tip is common as well.\n\n306\n00:15:24.579 --> 00:15:28.764\nAnd this is another type of earlier\nconnector as well with a single fiber.\n\n307\n00:15:28.764 --> 00:15:32.235\nAll right, now we've talked about\nkind of the transmission limits.\n\n308\n00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:35.899\nI want you to remember transmission\nspeeds, we're talking great speeds.\n\n309\n00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:37.171\nWe're talking 10 gig and\n\n310\n00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:40.329\nbeyond type networks when it comes\nto fiber optic communications.\n\n311\n00:15:40.329 --> 00:15:43.438\nThe transmission distances,\nagain multi-mode,\n\n312\n00:15:43.438 --> 00:15:47.370\nwe're talking about shorter\ndistances than single mode.\n\n313\n00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:54.219\nLong distances when it comes to\nyour single mode versus multi-mode.\n\n314\n00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:59.272\nNow, that really takes care of\nour fiber optic communications.\n\n315\n00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:03.238\nNow when fiber optic communications\nunderstands what they are for the exam,\n\n316\n00:16:03.238 --> 00:16:07.508\nThe next one we're gonna talk about, is\nthe other type of network connections that\n\n317\n00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.901\nwe have, and those are copper-based media.\n\n318\n00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:14.100\nAnd when it comes to copper-based media,\nwe've got a few choices.\n\n319\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, when I think of copper media,\n\n320\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.875\nthe first thing that pops from my mind,\nis typically coaxial cable.\n\n321\n00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:23.740\nJust because of that thick copper wire\nthat pokes out from the end of it, and\n\n322\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.635\nstabs me in the hand.\n\n323\n00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:27.487\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, it's interesting\nbecause you don't even really\n\n324\n00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.253\nhave to think about networking when\nit comes to coaxial media, right?\n\n325\n00:16:30.253 --> 00:16:34.300\nCuz, well, we've been using that for\ncable television for a very long time.\n\n326\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.130\nNow, in networking,\n\n327\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.160\none of the most popular copper-based\nmedias that we have is twisted pair.\n\n328\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.791\nAnd twisted pair implementations,\n\n329\n00:16:41.791 --> 00:16:45.220\nthey have an interesting characteristic\nthat really is how it gets its name.\n\n330\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.165\nIn fact,\nI got an example of one right here.\n\n331\n00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:49.360\nAnd I went ahead and\ntried to make it a little bit easier so\n\n332\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.600\nyou guys can see this a little\nbit better out there.\n\n333\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.786\nYou can actually see, well,\nyou could see the twisted pairs.\n\n334\n00:16:53.786 --> 00:16:58.255\nWhat we have, our eight conductors here,\nstraighten that out a little bit, and\n\n335\n00:16:58.255 --> 00:17:00.573\nthey are four individual twisted pairs.\n\n336\n00:17:00.573 --> 00:17:04.160\nAnd why do we have twists in the pairs?\n\n337\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.955\nWell, one of the things, unlike fiber\noptics, which is pretty much immune to\n\n338\n00:17:08.955 --> 00:17:12.890\nelectromagnetic interference, cuz it's\nan optical light source, is the fact that,\n\n339\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.560\nwell, copper-based media,\nwe do have to worry about interference.\n\n340\n00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.730\nWe have to worry about electromagnetic\nenergy actually getting into the cable.\n\n341\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.820\nAnd the problem with that is, it does have\nan adverse effect on the data that's being\n\n342\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.160\nsent along it, so\nthe twists are important, right?\n\n343\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.760\nThey help to mitigate the risk, or\n\n344\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.240\njust bring it down if you will, of EMI,\nagain, electromagnetic interference.\n\n345\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.050\nNow, as you will see,\nthese cables increase with their quality,\n\n346\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:42.070\nand when they do, what we have\nis an increased twist per inch.\n\n347\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.855\nAnd earlier cables,\nwhich we'll talk about coming up,\n\n348\n00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:48.835\nthe types that we have, would be a little\nbit more tolerant to untwisting,\n\n349\n00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:53.595\nwhen you are putting, like for instance\nthe jack on it, called an RJ45 jack.\n\n350\n00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:56.260\nSometimes people just\ncall it an ethernet jack.\n\n351\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.920\nAnd honestly guys, again if we're not in\nan exam circumstance, I wouldn't correct\n\n352\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.380\nyou there, but that's typically,\nthat is the RJ45 jack that we have.\n\n353\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:11.260\nAnd what you do, is you actually\nuntwist these pairs, all right?\n\n354\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.890\nAnd you put each one of these pairs\nin a certain arrangement in the back\n\n355\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.110\nof the RJ45 jack, and\n\n356\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.810\nyou'll see there's eight copper conductors\nright here, contacts, if you will.\n\n357\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.580\nThat's why sometimes,\nthe RJ45 jack is called and 8P8C, and\n\n358\n00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.140\nit mean eight pins,\neight conductors, right?\n\n359\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.820\nSo this is twisted pair.\n\n360\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.640\nNow, there are some things that could make\nthis cable a little bit more resistant,\n\n361\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.270\nif you will,\nto electromagnetic interference, and\n\n362\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:43.000\nthat's a type of twisted pair cable\ncalled STP, shielded twisted pair.\n\n363\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.380\nBecause not only do they have the twists,\nwhich all twisted pair have, but\n\n364\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.510\nthey also have a foil.\n\n365\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.040\nEither a braided or\nsolid foil shielding around the outside,\n\n366\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.470\nin between the outer insulated jacket and\nthe connectors themselves.\n\n367\n00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:05.090\nAnd again, it helps to raise the immunity\nto electromagnetic interference.\n\n368\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.554\nNow, one of the things also to keep\nin mind, is that these cables,\n\n369\n00:19:07.554 --> 00:19:09.175\nthere's also a few different types here.\n\n370\n00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:11.520\nAnd when we talk about\na few different types,\n\n371\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.106\nwhat we ended up talking about, is what's\nknown as plenum versus non-plenum.\n\n372\n00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:20.910\nYou'll see in the exam objectives,\nthey call it PVC versus plenum.\n\n373\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.973\nThey typically won't, on the side\nof the box when you go to buy it,\n\n374\n00:19:23.973 --> 00:19:27.587\nyou're not gonna see non-plenum, or\nyou're not gonna see PVC, excuse me,\n\n375\n00:19:27.587 --> 00:19:29.544\nyou're gonna see non-plenum, right?\n\n376\n00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.924\nNow, PVC, why am I worried about PVC?\n\n377\n00:19:31.924 --> 00:19:35.870\nWell, polyvinyl chloride,\nif I can say that right,\n\n378\n00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.380\npolyvinyl chloride gives off\na toxic gas when it's burned.\n\n379\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.480\nAnd so, according to fire code,\nif you have cat cables or the twisted\n\n380\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.712\npair cables that are running through\nfire breaks in your building structure,\n\n381\n00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:56.780\nthey could, again, give off a toxic gas\nthat is obviously poisonous to humans.\n\n382\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.033\nThe other thing about non-plenum cables or\nPVC-based cables,\n\n383\n00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:05.660\nis that that outer jacket, that actually\nprotects everything inside of the cable,\n\n384\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.710\nisn't really tightly wrapped\naround the interior of the cable.\n\n385\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.670\nWhich means that it also allows oxygen\nto pass though, and well, guess what,\n\n386\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.830\nfires love oxygen.\n\n387\n00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.190\nSo according to your fire code,\nbecause of the toxicity, if you will.\n\n388\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.254\nAnd because of the fact that there's\na little bit of an air gap in there,\n\n389\n00:20:23.254 --> 00:20:25.654\nit not only could poison people\nin the case of a fire, but\n\n390\n00:20:25.654 --> 00:20:28.697\nit can also allow the fire to travel\nright through the firebreak wall.\n\n391\n00:20:28.697 --> 00:20:30.606\nThat's where plenum comes in.\n\n392\n00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:34.046\nPlenum isn't used in things\nlike your structural cabling.\n\n393\n00:20:34.046 --> 00:20:37.838\nAnd what I mean by structural cabling,\nI mean inside of your building versus\n\n394\n00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:42.220\nsomething that's coming out of the wall,\ngoing right into the back of your PC.\n\n395\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.810\nThat's gonna be non-plenum, right?\n\n396\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.710\nBecause plenum is very expensive,\nbut it's a necessity,\n\n397\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.830\nbecause it doesn't give off a toxic fume,\nif you will, when burned.\n\n398\n00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.427\nAnd you can see plenum is a very very\nstiff cable, because that outer jacket\n\n399\n00:20:55.427 --> 00:20:59.150\nreally wraps around the internal\ncopper conductors very very tightly.\n\n400\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.447\nAgain, preventing the ability for\nfire to pass through it.\n\n401\n00:21:03.447 --> 00:21:04.910\n&gt;&gt; That whole wick effect, right, yeah?\n\n402\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.610\nThat's exactly, and you know,\nI've never even thought about it that way.\n\n403\n00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.010\nThat's a great way to think of it.\n\n404\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.171\nYour cable ends up becoming\nthe candle wick, right?\n\n405\n00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:13.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you have to be careful, or\n\n406\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.426\nmaybe a wick to dynamite.\n\n407\n00:21:14.426 --> 00:21:15.614\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:21:15.614 --> 00:21:17.950\n&gt;&gt; So definitely be careful with that.\n\n409\n00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.920\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we have to talk about.\n\n410\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.310\nOne of the things I also wanna talk about\nis just like we mentioned repeaters, for\n\n411\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.640\nfiber optic communication.\n\n412\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.120\nThe ability to regenerate the signal as it\n\n413\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.400\nhits the end of its maximum cable\ndistance, it hits a repeater.\n\n414\n00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.068\nIt regenerates the signal, boost it, and\n\n415\n00:21:36.068 --> 00:21:38.744\nnow you can go the length\nof another cable.\n\n416\n00:21:38.744 --> 00:21:44.510\nWell, you also have the ability to\ndo that inside a copper cabling.\n\n417\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.257\nBecause transmission distance maximums for\n\n418\n00:21:48.257 --> 00:21:52.198\nyour twisted pair implementations\nare a 100 meters, right?\n\n419\n00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:53.780\nAnything past a 100 meters,\n\n420\n00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.210\nyou run the risk of signal attenuation,\nwhich essentially is just nothing more\n\n421\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.120\nthan a degradation of the signal as it\ngets further from its transmission source.\n\n422\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.050\nYou also have the increased risk for\nelectromagnetic interference, or\n\n423\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.910\nsignal bleed, so you wanna know that\nit's a maximum of a hundred meters.\n\n424\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.130\nNow, that being said,\nI've kind of slipped out with this one but\n\n425\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.780\nI haven't really talked about it, is the\nfact that there are different standards.\n\n426\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.800\nThere is a corporation,\nor a standards body\n\n427\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.377\nthat is endorsed by the American National\nStandards Institute, known as TIA/EIA.\n\n428\n00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:30.860\nTelecommunication Industry\nAlliance/Electronics Industry Association,\n\n429\n00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.820\nI believe is what it is.\n\n430\n00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.670\nI might have the As backwards in that,\n\n431\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:38.840\nbut they're a standards body that promotes\ntechno-electrical communications.\n\n432\n00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.410\nAnd they came out with\na standardized way for\n\n433\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.400\nmanufacturers to make these cables,\nand we have to be aware of them too.\n\n434\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.681\nYou might hear the term CAT cable,\nand CAT cable,\n\n435\n00:22:51.681 --> 00:22:54.908\nis abbreviated for a category of a cable.\n\n436\n00:22:54.908 --> 00:22:58.892\nAnd the categories differ in their\ntransmission speeds really, cuz, again,\n\n437\n00:22:58.892 --> 00:23:01.515\ntwisted pair is gonna be\n100 meters regardless.\n\n438\n00:23:01.515 --> 00:23:05.522\nSo let's go ahead real quick, and let's\ntake a look at a big long laundry list\n\n439\n00:23:05.522 --> 00:23:09.960\nthat I have [LAUGH] when it comes to\nthese different CAT cables, all right?\n\n440\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.992\nWe have what's known as CAT3.\n\n441\n00:23:11.992 --> 00:23:14.352\nCAT3 is one of the oldest\nof the twisted pairs,\n\n442\n00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:16.950\none of the very first\ntwisted pair implementation.\n\n443\n00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.776\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I just thought of this,\nyou're the cat lady.\n\n444\n00:23:20.776 --> 00:23:22.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right, I gotta be,\n\n445\n00:23:22.915 --> 00:23:23.512\nI've gotta be.\n\n446\n00:23:23.512 --> 00:23:24.112\nIt's okay, I'll take one for\nthe team, it doesn't matter.\n\n447\n00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:25.356\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] you have a lot of\n\n448\n00:23:25.356 --> 00:23:25.942\ncats there bro.\n\n449\n00:23:25.942 --> 00:23:27.092\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n450\n00:23:27.092 --> 00:23:29.757\n[LAUGH] So CAT cables, you might say,\nwell, CAT3 cables, well,\n\n451\n00:23:29.757 --> 00:23:30.623\nare they still used?\n\n452\n00:23:30.623 --> 00:23:33.120\nWell, yes and no.\n\n453\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.403\nVoice communications do not\ntake a lot of bandwidth.\n\n454\n00:23:35.403 --> 00:23:40.080\nSo they can be used for audio, or\nexcuse me, voice communications and\n\n455\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.470\nthings like telephone companies.\n\n456\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.795\nBut for the most part, they're kind of\noutdated, cuz they're only 10 megs, right?\n\n457\n00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:50.055\nWe're in gigabit ethernet today,\nyou've got 10 gigabit ethernet,\n\n458\n00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:53.090\n100 megabit ethernet, and\ngigabit ethernet, right?\n\n459\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.520\nWell, CAT3 cables are kinda outdated,\nif you will.\n\n460\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.250\nYou also have CAT5 cables.\n\n461\n00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.431\nCAT5 cables, keep in mind,\nare 100 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n462\n00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:06.811\nAnd then, you move up into what's known\nas CAT5E, all right, CAT5 enhanced.\n\n463\n00:24:06.811 --> 00:24:12.142\nNow There's a little bit of speculation\non this one, because CAT5e is called\n\n464\n00:24:12.142 --> 00:24:17.140\ngigabit Ethernet unlike CAT5 cable,\nwhich is called fast Ethernet.\n\n465\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.605\nAnd a CAT3 that's just called Ethernet,\nbecause manufacturers, again,\n\n466\n00:24:20.605 --> 00:24:23.815\nDan, you mentioned this in many\nepisodes of the numbers game, right?\n\n467\n00:24:23.815 --> 00:24:25.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The marketing game.\n\n468\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.440\nWell, when CAT5e came out they called\nit gigabit Ethernet, because you have\n\n469\n00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.510\nthe potential in very short distances\nto maintain a gigabit connection.\n\n470\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:38.490\nHowever, rated more common is gonna\nbe around 350 megabits and, again,\n\n471\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.460\nI don't want you to worry about that for\nthe exam other than know that\n\n472\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.660\nit could be anywhere in between 350 and\na gigabit itself, yes,\n\n473\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.930\nyou can obtain gigabyte speeds,\nbut not at a full hundred meters.\n\n474\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.574\nAnd that's one of the things that really\ndiffers when we talk about CAT5E vs CAT6.\n\n475\n00:24:53.574 --> 00:24:57.421\nCAT6, we have a sustained bits,\nsustained speeds,\n\n476\n00:24:57.421 --> 00:25:02.720\ntransmission speeds of the gigabyte,\nout to a hundred meters.\n\n477\n00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.840\nNow, with today's day and age.\n\n478\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.490\nWe have ten gig networks and\nbeyond, right?\n\n479\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:13.290\nWell, the problem is the ten gig network\ndidn't really, gigabit network if you\n\n480\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.680\nwill, the CAT6 cable wasn't\nreally suitable for that, right?\n\n481\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.930\nYou also have to worry about things like\nelectromagnetic interference when you have\n\n482\n00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.860\nthose speeds.\n\n483\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.150\nBecause when you have ten gigabit network,\n\n484\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.730\nyou can't really tolerate electromagnetic\ninterference to maintain those speeds.\n\n485\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.740\nSo, the CAT6 cable wasn't adequate for\nthat, right?\n\n486\n00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.650\nSo, that's when they\ncame out with a CAT6a.\n\n487\n00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.160\nNow, the CAT6a I put at a gigabit plus.\n\n488\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.550\nI don't know, what they're\ngonna ask you on the exam, but\n\n489\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:43.130\nthe CAT6a cable can sustain a 10\ngigabit speed at 55 meters, right?\n\n490\n00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:48.081\nNot the whole 100 meters, but it can\nsustain your, actually I take that back.\n\n491\n00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:54.610\nThe CAT6a can sustain it at a full\n100 meters a gigabit speed.\n\n492\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.640\nBut it can only produce, I believe,\nit's 10 gigabits at around 55 meters.\n\n493\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.890\nNow, there's CAT7 that\nthey call out on the exam.\n\n494\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.410\nLet's be careful with CAT, and\nI don't know, what G-B-B-P-A is there,\n\n495\n00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.520\nlet me correct my acronym.\n\n496\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.880\n&gt;&gt; I thought, it was an site [LAUGH].\n\n497\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.820\n&gt;&gt; CAT7, that's an unofficial term.\n\n498\n00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.160\nDoesn't recognize a CAT7 cable,\nit's on the exam.\n\n499\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.830\nBut CAT7 is, again, true potential,\nsustained ten gigabit speeds.\n\n500\n00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.360\nAnd it also adds extra shielding,\nso it's a double shielding.\n\n501\n00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.080\nWhat you have is not only the shield\naround all the conductors, but\n\n502\n00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.620\neach individual conductor\nhas a foil shielding.\n\n503\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.990\nSo, remember, CAT6, CAT6a, CAT7, we're\nall talking about a gigabit and beyond.\n\n504\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:47.040\nDoesn't matter what the twisted pair\nstandard, it is 100 meters maximum.\n\n505\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.510\nNow, even though this\nisn't a CAT connection,\n\n506\n00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:54.100\nthey also call out the RJ11 jack,\nthat I just wanna briefly mention that,\n\n507\n00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.640\nbecause that is for\ntelephone communications.\n\n508\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.660\nYou've probably seen that,\nif you remember the dial up modems, right.\n\n509\n00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.680\nThe half size, it's half the size of the\nRJ45 jack, and again, it is commonly used\n\n510\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:10.830\nfor things like dial up, and traditional\ntelephone communications that you have.\n\n511\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.873\nNow, I also mentioned that RJ45 jack,\nas being,\n\n512\n00:27:13.873 --> 00:27:16.165\nthere's a way to wire the RJ45 jack.\n\n513\n00:27:16.165 --> 00:27:21.110\nAnd this is really about how the copper\nconductors are wired in the back.\n\n514\n00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.100\nOf that jack.\n\n515\n00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.530\nSo, for instance if we take\na look here at these connectors,\n\n516\n00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.040\nwe do have a few different\nwiring standards.\n\n517\n00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:33.067\nWe have what's known as 50 TEA,\nthe 560 AA, and\n\n518\n00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:37.982\n560 AB, and\nwhat it boils down to is how the copper\n\n519\n00:27:37.982 --> 00:27:42.475\nconductors sit in the back\nof this RJ45 jack.\n\n520\n00:27:42.475 --> 00:27:45.005\nAnd if you're talking about 568A,\n\n521\n00:27:45.005 --> 00:27:49.759\nthen what you're talking about is\nthe green wires are for transmission,\n\n522\n00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:53.456\nand your orange wires,\nif you will, are for receiving.\n\n523\n00:27:53.456 --> 00:27:57.389\nAnd it typically goes your green,\norange, blue in the middle, and\n\n524\n00:27:57.389 --> 00:28:01.290\nanother orange, and then,\nyour brown here at the end.\n\n525\n00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:06.390\nNow, when you talk about cats, or excuse\nme, 568B, it's a little bit different.\n\n526\n00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.430\nWhat you end up having is you\ntake actually your orange cables,\n\n527\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.090\nthe orange and\nthe green are reversed, right.\n\n528\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:17.140\nSo, the orange cables become your transmit\nconductors where we would split up,\n\n529\n00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.530\nif you will, the green and it would go\norange, then it would go green, blue, and\n\n530\n00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.840\nbrown, or orange and then brown.\n\n531\n00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.760\nAnd that's two different types of\nwiring standards, and, in fact,\n\n532\n00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.770\nto make it a little easier to\nunderstand let's go ahead.\n\n533\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:34.210\nI have a little diagram here that\nkinda shows you the 568A standard.\n\n534\n00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.850\nAll right, understand the dotted lines\nare for what the stripe that's on it.\n\n535\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:43.000\nAnd this is how you would wire\na 568A type of connection.\n\n536\n00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.042\nNotice that the green, we've got green\ntransmit for the pins one and two.\n\n537\n00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:49.321\nAnd when I say pins one and two,\n\n538\n00:28:49.321 --> 00:28:54.324\nthat RJ45 jack connects the 8 pins\nwithin a network adapter, and\n\n539\n00:28:54.324 --> 00:28:59.412\nEthernet network adapter on the back\nof your PC, as well as pins 3 and\n\n540\n00:28:59.412 --> 00:29:04.150\n6 being your received pins and\nyou have your ground pins for 4,\n\n541\n00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:08.150\n5, 7 and 8, but\nnotice that we also have 568B.\n\n542\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:12.130\nAnd guys and gals out there,\nmake it easier on yourselves on the exam.\n\n543\n00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:16.150\nJust realize that it's the orange and\ngreen that are really just swapped, right?\n\n544\n00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.780\nNow, notice, that the orange is for\nyour transmit pins,\n\n545\n00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:26.230\nthat's Tx, transmit pins, pins 1 and 2,\nand pins 3 and 6 are now the green pins.\n\n546\n00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.820\nAll right, and again, 8P8C, or\n\n547\n00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.810\nan RJ45 jack those are the pins\nthat make a connection into\n\n548\n00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.860\nthe Ethernet adaptor itself, or\nthe network adaptor on the machine.\n\n549\n00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.299\nNow, it's interesting that the very first\nthing that we talked about Copper media\n\n550\n00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:42.753\nDan mentioned was coaxial,\nand I was like, yeah, it's so\n\n551\n00:29:42.753 --> 00:29:45.671\npopular that we'll talk about it\nat the end there, right?, [LAUGH].\n\n552\n00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, let's go in and double back to\n\n553\n00:29:48.643 --> 00:29:53.500\nthe one that Dan was talking about,\nand that is coaxial implementations.\n\n554\n00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.320\nNow, coaxial is used in\nthings like cable TV, and\n\n555\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.360\nthat does bring your cable and Internet\nconnection into your residential houses.\n\n556\n00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.470\nI will tell you that as far as network\ncommunications outside of that,\n\n557\n00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.710\nyou're not really gonna see it for\nnetworking.\n\n558\n00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.530\nIt was one of the very earliest\nethernet-based standards.\n\n559\n00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.670\nAgain, a network communications standard.\n\n560\n00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:19.615\nHowever, it's still very prevalent in\naudio and Video, in fact, we've actually\n\n561\n00:30:19.615 --> 00:30:23.815\ngot a couple of different coaxial cables\nthat we'll show you here in just a second.\n\n562\n00:30:23.815 --> 00:30:27.765\nI wanna mention a little bit about\nthe connectors themselves too.\n\n563\n00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:28.575\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n564\n00:30:28.575 --> 00:30:32.140\nlet's take a look at the different\ntypes of connectors that you will see.\n\n565\n00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.180\nAnd I've actually got a little diagram\nhere, I say, diagram a little picture\n\n566\n00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:40.040\nhere, and there is the BNC connector\nthat's a common coaxial connector there,\n\n567\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.540\nand I've heard all different names of\nwhat this stands for I've heard B-A-N-\n\n568\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.260\n&gt;&gt; Neo councilmen.\n\n569\n00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.510\n&gt;&gt; Neo councilmen, yeah, thank you.\n\n570\n00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.889\nBritish naval connectors the one that I've\nheard too, and you can see [CROSSTALK],\n\n571\n00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:50.960\nyes, they are very good.\n\n572\n00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.909\nYou can see that it is a single\ncopper conductor versus\n\n573\n00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:58.120\neight individual copper conductors.\n\n574\n00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.200\nAnd what you end up having is you\nhave this outer insulating jacket\n\n575\n00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:09.250\non the cable you have a braided shielding\naround that central copper conductor.\n\n576\n00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.490\nAnd what's protecting\nthe central copper conductor\n\n577\n00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:17.210\nis actually a dielectric coating\nwithin the center of the cable.\n\n578\n00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.140\nSo, that's the BNC.\n\n579\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.380\nThe other one they called out,\nmaybe you've seen as well.\n\n580\n00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.390\nThat's the F connector,\nthat's another common type of connector.\n\n581\n00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:29.270\nThis is our threaded type connector\nversus the BNC connector,\n\n582\n00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.760\nwhich actually a twist and\nlock type connector.\n\n583\n00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.340\nIn fact, I have an example of a B, or\n\n584\n00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.700\nexcuse me, one of these B and C connectors\nright here you can see this, Dan.\n\n585\n00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.410\nAnd if you could grab me that other one,\nDan,\n\n586\n00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.910\nthere is actually two cables,\nwe're gonna kinda talk about.\n\n587\n00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.410\nOne is a little bit older,\none is a little bit newer.\n\n588\n00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.750\nThank you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no problem.\n\n589\n00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.039\n&gt;&gt; If yo notice, we've got both of them\nhave the B and C connector on them, so\n\n590\n00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.910\nthe connectors are pretty much the same.\n\n591\n00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.946\nWhat's different though if,\njust sheer size.\n\n592\n00:31:55.946 --> 00:31:58.076\nI mean, if you look at\nthe cables next to each other.\n\n593\n00:31:58.076 --> 00:31:59.452\nLet me see if I can get the red in there.\n\n594\n00:31:59.452 --> 00:32:01.158\nLook at the difference in this.\n\n595\n00:32:01.158 --> 00:32:04.027\nThis is the earlier connector.\n\n596\n00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:05.494\n&gt;&gt; Cable.\n&gt;&gt; Cable type, excuse me, thank you,\n\n597\n00:32:05.494 --> 00:32:06.530\nabsolutely.\n\n598\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.005\nThis was what's known as an RG59.\n\n599\n00:32:08.005 --> 00:32:13.780\nThat RG standard goes back to military\ncode for, it's called Radio Grade Five.\n\n600\n00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.276\nI'm not sure if we still use\nthe military standards, but\n\n601\n00:32:16.276 --> 00:32:19.458\nthey definitely adopted it for\nthe naming convention in coaxial media.\n\n602\n00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:25.341\nBut you can see,\nthis is the RG59 versus what's known and\n\n603\n00:32:25.341 --> 00:32:30.600\nmore common today,\na higher quality, RG6 cable.\n\n604\n00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.730\nSo you could see, I mean if you just,\nthe sheer difference in size can show you.\n\n605\n00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.340\nThis is a very, very good cable.\n\n606\n00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.968\nAnd I actually stole this from our\nproduction team here that helps with all\n\n607\n00:32:40.968 --> 00:32:43.616\nthe video behind the scenes\nthat you guys don't see.\n\n608\n00:32:43.616 --> 00:32:50.493\nAnd this is the RG6 and that's the one\nthat's kinda replaced the earlier RG59.\n\n609\n00:32:50.493 --> 00:32:54.250\nNow I said replaced guys, you obviously\nsee we've got both kinds here.\n\n610\n00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.160\nSo it's not to say that it's\ncompletely obsolete, but\n\n611\n00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.242\nthe RG6 is a lot more common today.\n\n612\n00:33:01.242 --> 00:33:03.840\nAll right now,\none of the last things then I know,\n\n613\n00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.970\nDan's letting me know we gotta wrap\nthis one up soon is that splitters and\n\n614\n00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.860\nhow they affect the coaxial\ncommunications.\n\n615\n00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:13.160\nOne of the things that if you're\nfamiliar with cable television,\n\n616\n00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.950\nmaybe you guys have some multiple\nsplitter within your house.\n\n617\n00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.980\nUnderstand when you split a coaxial\nsignal, it weakens, right?\n\n618\n00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.940\nWe have a certain amount of bandwidth,\n\n619\n00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.010\nwe have a certain amount of water that\ncan be sent through the hose, right?\n\n620\n00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.680\nAnd if I put a splitter on them right,\nI've got half of that\n\n621\n00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.320\nwater going in one direction, half of\nthe water going in the other direction.\n\n622\n00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.950\nYou can split coaxial communications, but\n\n623\n00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:38.790\nit's like dividing up a piece of pie,\nright.\n\n624\n00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.280\nI've got a whole pie, if I cut in half,\nwell now you have half of what you did\n\n625\n00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.670\noriginally, so you might see especially\nin my video that you need things like,\n\n626\n00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.890\nkind of like a repeater,\na booster, a regenerator.\n\n627\n00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.850\nBecause you can only split\na coaxial communication so\n\n628\n00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:58.560\nmuch before it's gonna\nstart degrading the signal.\n\n629\n00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.900\nIn networking today, guys,\n\n630\n00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.370\nI wouldn't even worry about when it\ncomes to coaxial implementations.\n\n631\n00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.830\nBut definitely know that for the most\npart, the only thing you're gonna see in\n\n632\n00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:14.800\na network is more for your CATV as\nwell as your cable based internet.\n\n633\n00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.430\nA lot of different standards guys, I know.\n\n634\n00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.748\nA lot of different connections,\n\n635\n00:34:17.748 --> 00:34:20.663\nit's some of the first things we talk\nabout when it comes to networking but\n\n636\n00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:24.047\nif you're going to connect your devices to\nthe back of those machines, you gotta know\n\n637\n00:34:24.047 --> 00:34:26.843\nwhat your options are and you gotta\nknow some of the characteristics.\n\n638\n00:34:26.843 --> 00:34:29.898\n&gt;&gt; All right, this is definite flash\ncard material, ladies and gentlemen, so\n\n639\n00:34:29.898 --> 00:34:31.214\nmake sure that you create those or\n\n640\n00:34:31.214 --> 00:34:33.951\nwhatever you need to do to burn all\nthis information into your brain.\n\n641\n00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:38.406\nBecause it is that rote type of\nmemorization that's gonna help you get\n\n642\n00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:42.040\npast these kinds of questions\non the A plus exam.\n\n643\n00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.050\nWell it's just a lot of stuff.\n\n644\n00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.380\nSo just soak it in, soak it in.\n\n645\n00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.353\nSimmer in it until you-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n646\n00:34:46.353 --> 00:34:49.116\n&gt;&gt; Assimilated into your inner person.\n\n647\n00:34:49.116 --> 00:34:52.480\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time as Wes alluded to.\n\n648\n00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.700\nBut we do thank you for watching.\n\n649\n00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.690\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel

00:00:30.335\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:33.190\nGreat to be up here in\nthe studio at ITProTV.\n\n15\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.094\nThat is right,\nwe are moving along like Dan said,\n\n16\n00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:38.596\nin our very first A+ certification exam.\n\n17\n00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:42.909\nAnd over the past couple of episodes, Dan\nand I have been walking you through things\n\n18\n00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.115\nlike networking, right,\nnetworking communications and,\n\n19\n00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.258\none of the things that we've\nkinda just briefly hinted at but\n\n20\n00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:52.954\nkinda left you with cliff hangers is\nwe talked about how data in networks\n\n21\n00:00:52.954 --> 00:00:56.130\nmoves between what's known as\nthe source and destination.\n\n22\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.600\nAnd we kinda talked just\nbriefly about addressing.\n\n23\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.420\nAnd that's what we're gonna look at.\n\n24\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.970\nWe're gonna look at, first of all some\nof the major protocols that are in\n\n25\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.240\nsomething known as TCPIP kinda\nintroduce you to what TCPIP even is.\n\n26\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.624\nAnd then we're really gonna be spending\nsome time here in the concept of\n\n27\n00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:14.510\naddressing.\n\n28\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.570\nSo that's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.950\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n30\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.010\nAnd Dan just like we've done in\nalmost every single episode,\n\n31\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.290\nwe're not shy in acronyms and\nwe're gonna start talking about TCP/IP.\n\n32\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always a fun one, right?\n\n33\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.610\nDon't you just love the acronyms, they\njust wave over you like a lovely breeze on\n\n34\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.620\na spring day that makes you wanna hate\nlife because there's a lot of them,\n\n35\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.845\nthere's a ton of them to go through.\n\n36\n00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:41.896\nTCP/IP though that is one\nthat you want to focus on.\n\n37\n00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:45.585\nThis is gonna be the one that you wanna\nknow like the back of your hand because\n\n38\n00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:48.631\nnot just for your A+ but\nas you move on on more certification,\n\n39\n00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:51.696\nthis is gonna be a very pertinent\nthing for you to understand.\n\n40\n00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:55.650\nSo let's start there Wes, TCP/IP,\nwhat does that even mean?\n\n41\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.100\n&gt;&gt; I really don't have any clue.\n\n42\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.199\nJust kidding guys- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching everyone.\n\n43\n00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:00.039\n&gt;&gt; That's right breakfast or not.\n\n44\n00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.747\nSo TCP/IP.\n\n45\n00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:02.736\nThis is actually a protocol suite.\n\n46\n00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:06.385\nThe name implies two protocols, right?\n\n47\n00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:07.625\nIn some other episode, Dan and\n\n48\n00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.590\nI talked about some of the major\nprotocols and ports if you will.\n\n49\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.745\nThat you can see that will be used for\ndifferent services but, when we talk about\n\n50\n00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:18.490\nTCP/IP, we're not really just talking\nabout transmission control protocol,\n\n51\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.950\nthat connection oriented service\nthat we mentioned in other episodes\n\n52\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.240\nthat guarantees a stateful delivery.\n\n53\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.500\nWe're gonna kinda have our\ndelivery confirmation.\n\n54\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.710\nWe're gonna send our email or we're\nWe're gonna send our communication and\n\n55\n00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.800\nwe're gonna find out hey,\nis that information,\n\n56\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.570\nhas that data actually made\nthe trip across the network and\n\n57\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.020\nmaintain its integrity, it get there in\nthe right order but we also talk about IP.\n\n58\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.287\nNow IP is an interesting one,\n\n59\n00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:47.732\nthis is where we get once known\nas the Internet Protocol.\n\n60\n00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:51.780\nAn Internet Protocol it is\na connectionless service, right?\n\n61\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.645\nIt has not idea of really How to get\nyour information across the network but\n\n62\n00:02:56.645 --> 00:03:01.525\nit does tell you where the information\nis going and where it has come from.\n\n63\n00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:05.480\nNow just when I say TCP/IP I\nsaid it is a suite of protocols.\n\n64\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.110\nSo when we talk about a suite of\nprotocols what do we really mean by that?\n\n65\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.510\nWell TCP/IP isn't just those two protocols\nin the fact that it's actually a family of\n\n66\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.508\nprotocols, if you will.\n\n67\n00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:16.828\nAnd they're kinda like\nall holding hands and\n\n68\n00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:20.871\nthey are helping get your communications,\nif you will, across the network.\n\n69\n00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:24.559\nAnd sometimes we reach out and\nwe tag one of the protocols in so\n\n70\n00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:25.800\nthat it can help us.\n\n71\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.850\nAnd sometimes we don't use others and\n\n72\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.150\nit really depends on what we\nare trying to accomplish.\n\n73\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.000\nNow, when we look at our objectives,\n\n74\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.380\nthey call out the two addressing\nprotocols that we have to be aware of.\n\n75\n00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.630\nBut a little bit more on TCP/IP,\nunderstand that TCP/IP has been around for\n\n76\n00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.384\na very long time.\n\n77\n00:03:43.384 --> 00:03:47.202\nIn fact, the earliest days of what was\nknown as the ARPANET before it was,\n\n78\n00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:49.060\nlater given over to public domain.\n\n79\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.150\nIt was reinvented or\nrenamed as the internet.\n\n80\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.960\nIt was really just militaries and\nuniversities if you will.\n\n81\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.925\nAnd really just a handful of them that\nwere communicating across this massive\n\n82\n00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.330\ninterconnected network.\n\n83\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.068\nAnd we needed to get\ninformation across that.\n\n84\n00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:08.137\nSo the Advanced Research Project Agency\na part of the Department of Defense, DOD\n\n85\n00:04:08.137 --> 00:04:14.710\ncame up with a highly optimized protocol\nsolution that would allow us to do that.\n\n86\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.930\nIn fact, in the earlier days it was called\nthe DOD protocol suite later renamed.\n\n87\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.150\nSo TCP/IP again,\nkeep in mind it is what we use.\n\n88\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.448\nIt's that body DNA protocols,\ncommunication protocols,\n\n89\n00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:30.503\nthat allows us to move\ninformation across the internet.\n\n90\n00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:35.162\nNow, I just briefly mentioned something\nknown as, well, addressing, right?\n\n91\n00:04:35.162 --> 00:04:39.000\nAddressing is, when we talk about\nthe internet protocol, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.810\nWhat we mean is that this is how we\nidentify where the information's going to\n\n93\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.120\nand where it is coming from.\n\n94\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.310\nIn fact, you can kinda think of it like\nFor instance here in the United States,\n\n95\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.520\nor maybe you're in other countries, they\nhave some kind of postal system, right?\n\n96\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.370\nWhere we take our snail mail, piece of\npaper if you will and we address it.\n\n97\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.435\nWe stamp the letter and\nwe put it in the mail and,\n\n98\n00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:02.205\nwe let the mail carrier take\nit across their vast network.\n\n99\n00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:05.657\nWell it's really not too much\ndifferent when you think about network\n\n100\n00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:06.718\ncommunications.\n\n101\n00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:10.444\nWe have an addressing system\nthat let's the devices,\n\n102\n00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:13.691\nthey call them intermediate devices,\nright.\n\n103\n00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:17.616\nWe have, in networking, if you think about\nit, we have what are known as end points,\n\n104\n00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:18.660\nor end systems right.\n\n105\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.281\nSo let me give you an example, if I was\ngonna send some information directly to\n\n106\n00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.470\nDan, my computer and Dan's computer right.\n\n107\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.565\nThese would be what's known as the end\npoints, you can also think of them as\n\n108\n00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:31.880\nthe source and\ndestination of the network communications.\n\n109\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.580\nNow when we say source and destination\nit's a perspective thing, it's relative to\n\n110\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.700\nwho's sending the communications\nversus who's receiving it right.\n\n111\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.153\nIf I'm sending information\nto Dan's computer, well,\n\n112\n00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:44.488\nI'm the source of the communication,\nDan's computer is the destination.\n\n113\n00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:47.769\nJust likewise, if Dan says, yeah,\nthat was an absolute ugly guitar,\n\n114\n00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:49.362\ndon't ever send that to me again.\n\n115\n00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:49.907\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:49.907 --> 00:05:51.030\n&gt;&gt; That would be Dan being\n\n117\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.070\nthe source of the communication,\nand I would be the destination.\n\n118\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.288\nSo now, if we take that concept and\nlet's go back to the mail system,\n\n119\n00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:01.801\nsource of the information would kinda\nbe like the return address, right?\n\n120\n00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:04.052\nWhen you put that snail\nmail letter in there,\n\n121\n00:06:04.052 --> 00:06:07.060\nyou have to kinda know\nwhere it's coming from.\n\n122\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.910\nWell, at least the carrier does, right?\n\n123\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.840\nAs well as where it's going to.\n\n124\n00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.224\nSo in this case,\nwe also have a destination address, and\n\n125\n00:06:14.224 --> 00:06:18.314\nagain the destination address lets\nthe devices that actually handle\n\n126\n00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:21.219\nthe communications know\nwhere to send it right.\n\n127\n00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.703\nNow the devices we'll talk about in\nanother episode because we do have certain\n\n128\n00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:28.110\nnetwork connectivity devices and\nthose are intermediate systems.\n\n129\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.733\nAnd what they're responsible for doing\nis much like our mail carrier systems.\n\n130\n00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:35.903\nThey're responsible for inspecting the\ndata, figuring out where it's going to,\n\n131\n00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:38.438\nand then determining the best\npath to get it there.\n\n132\n00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:41.802\nAll right so again that's a little\nabout what we're gonna talk about\n\n133\n00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:45.456\nreally the heavily gonna focus in we\nmight have go in multiple parts here and\n\n134\n00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:47.750\nreally heavily in the first part.\n\n135\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.502\nWe're gonna talk about all\nabout the internet protocol and\n\n136\n00:06:50.502 --> 00:06:53.266\na couple of variants that we have\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n137\n00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:56.800\nNow Dan made a great point at\nthe beginning here talking about TCBIP.\n\n138\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.000\nIf you're going into computing,\nyou need to know it.\n\n139\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.240\nYou might say for instance,\n\n140\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.800\njust like I did when I started\nout as an A+ technician.\n\n141\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.994\nWell why do I have to\nknow about networking?\n\n142\n00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:08.479\nReally, when it comes down to\nit I've got a computer here,\n\n143\n00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.494\nI wanna know about the computer,\nI wanna learn how to fix the computer.\n\n144\n00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:16.290\nWell, my A+ instructor\ngave some admonishment to\n\n145\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.680\nthe class that I first started in way back\nwhen I first started A+ as a student.\n\n146\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.710\nHe said if you don't understand\nnetworking, chances are you'll deliver\n\n147\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.910\nthe computer in a box and\nyou're not gonna touch it after that.\n\n148\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.761\nAnd it really comes down to\nthe fact that there aren't many\n\n149\n00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:35.050\ndevices that we have computing devices\nthat don't connect directly to networks.\n\n150\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.932\nSo even on a basic level you have to\nunderstand it in order to do basic\n\n151\n00:07:39.932 --> 00:07:41.080\nsupport okay.\n\n152\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.610\nSo that's why it's important.\n\n153\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.182\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive into\nsomething known as IP, all right.\n\n154\n00:07:47.182 --> 00:07:51.651\nWe have two primary types of addresses\nthat we really have to know all right.\n\n155\n00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.987\nWe have what is known as\nthe internet protocol version 4.0,\n\n156\n00:07:53.987 --> 00:07:56.422\nwe also have what's known as\ninternet protocol version 6.0.\n\n157\n00:07:56.422 --> 00:07:59.202\nAnd we'll talk about\nthe differences between them and\n\n158\n00:07:59.202 --> 00:08:01.022\nwhy we would need two to begin with.\n\n159\n00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.407\nLet's go ahead and let's step back and\nlet's talk about IPv4.\n\n160\n00:08:04.407 --> 00:08:08.736\nAll right, in fact, I've got a Windows\nmachine here on my desktop here.\n\n161\n00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:12.438\nAnd if I look down in the network adapter,\nmy head's kind of covering it up.\n\n162\n00:08:12.438 --> 00:08:15.218\nBut if I right-click on the little\nnetwork icon here, right,\n\n163\n00:08:15.218 --> 00:08:18.009\nit looks like a little monitor\nthere with a trident pitchfork.\n\n164\n00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:21.504\nAnd I open up Network and Sharing Center,\nand what's great about Network and\n\n165\n00:08:21.504 --> 00:08:24.462\nSharing Center, it doesn't matter\nwhat edition of Windows in,\n\n166\n00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.222\ngoing all the way back to Vista,\nWindows 7, 8, 8.1, they're all the same so\n\n167\n00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:30.290\nit really largely hasn't changed.\n\n168\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.080\nIf I open up my network adapter settings,\nmy network adapter\n\n169\n00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.570\nis what's responsible for the network\ncommunications within the network.\n\n170\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.885\nWell, it has to has an address to be\nable to send and receive communications.\n\n171\n00:08:43.885 --> 00:08:47.036\nSo what we're gonna do here is we're gonna\nkind of look at the properties of our\n\n172\n00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:49.923\nnetwork adapter and if I right-click\non it I can see a couple of things.\n\n173\n00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:53.180\nI can see the properties, and in fact,\nlet's go ahead and start at status.\n\n174\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.220\nWe'll look at properties here when we talk\nabout how do we configure IP addresses?\n\n175\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.036\nIf I look at the status here,\nI'll try it again,\n\n176\n00:09:01.036 --> 00:09:04.338\napparently I don't know how\nto right-click, [LAUGH] and\n\n177\n00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:08.765\nI look at details, what I can see is that\nI have a series of information here.\n\n178\n00:09:08.765 --> 00:09:10.455\nThere's a lot of different\ninformation guys.\n\n179\n00:09:10.455 --> 00:09:12.870\nWe're not really gonna talk about\nall of this information here, but\n\n180\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.800\nwhat I am really focused on\nis this little IPv4 address.\n\n181\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.260\nNotice that it has\na certain value here and\n\n182\n00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.130\nthe certain value in this case is\nwhat's known as a decimal value, and\n\n183\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.480\nmore importantly, you can see that\nit's separated by some dots here.\n\n184\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.180\nYou might hear the term\ndotted decimal notation.\n\n185\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.718\nNow when we talk about an IP address\nthe format is actually four individual\n\n186\n00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:36.644\nblocks if you will of decimal values and\nthese,\n\n187\n00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:39.957\nagain that's why we call\nthem dotted decimal value.\n\n188\n00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:43.385\nNow we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna open up the hood if you will, and\n\n189\n00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:45.264\nwe'll look at the engine coming up, but\n\n190\n00:09:45.264 --> 00:09:47.800\nunderstand that underneath\nall of this is binary.\n\n191\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.540\nEverything that we see in computing, I\ndon't care what operating system you have,\n\n192\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.960\ndoesn't matter if you have Windows,\ndoesn't matter if you have Unix/Linux,\n\n193\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.509\ndoesn't matter if you have Mac,\nlike we have here on some of our systems,\n\n194\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.120\neverything speaks binary, which is\na series of basically ones and zeros.\n\n195\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.108\nNow, in an IPv4 address, believe it or\nnot, these four blocks are actually\n\n196\n00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:13.023\ncalled octets and in the decimal,\nin the decimal notation,\n\n197\n00:10:13.023 --> 00:10:17.272\nit doesn't really make sense as\nto why they're called an octet.\n\n198\n00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:21.672\nBut underneath understand that\neach block is comprised of eight\n\n199\n00:10:21.672 --> 00:10:25.010\nindividual binary bits\nhence the term octet.\n\n200\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.145\nOctet is short for eight bits if you will.\n\n201\n00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:33.133\nThat means that an IPv4 address,\nif you add four of\n\n202\n00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:38.490\nthose 8-bit octets,\nis a 32-bit binary number.\n\n203\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.860\nNow if you think about it, a 32-bit binary\nnumber isn't very user-friendly, and\n\n204\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:49.930\nthe reason being is imagine if you had to\nconnect or communicate with a computer,\n\n205\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:55.480\nand you had to know 32 individual ones and\nzeros.\n\n206\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.188\nI tell you what, I can barely remember my\nown phone number, let alone [LAUGH] if you\n\n207\n00:11:00.188 --> 00:11:05.460\nwill 32 ones and zeros and at the basic\nlevel that's why this is denoted this way,\n\n208\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.990\nbecause decimal notation is a lot easier\nfor us because well if you think about it,\n\n209\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.639\nit's what we deal with on a daily basis.\n\n210\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.470\nDecimal notation is what's known\nas a base10 numbering system.\n\n211\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.461\nAll right and when we look at base10\nnumbering system understand that we're\n\n212\n00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:26.677\ntalking 9 or excuse me, 10 [LAUGH] basic\nvalues, I don't know what base9 is but\n\n213\n00:11:26.677 --> 00:11:30.003\nbase10, and\nif you look what the base10 means,\n\n214\n00:11:30.003 --> 00:11:34.780\nessentially is we have 0 through 9,\n10 possible values.\n\n215\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.044\nNow that being said,\nkeep in mind, underneath,\n\n216\n00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:42.505\nour computers are not seeing base10.\n\n217\n00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:46.010\nThey speak in another numbering system,\nand that's known as binary.\n\n218\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.160\n&gt;&gt; The good old binary.\n\n219\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.725\nThey give you the ones and the zeros,\nit's something you probably heard quite\n\n220\n00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:55.957\na bit as you've gotten into your\ntechnological education, as it were.\n\n221\n00:11:55.957 --> 00:11:59.843\nThat a computer speaks zeros and ones,\nons and offs, trues and falses, and\n\n222\n00:11:59.843 --> 00:12:03.975\nthis is where you're probably are first\nencountering it as something practical\n\n223\n00:12:03.975 --> 00:12:05.390\nthat we'll actually use.\n\n224\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.800\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, in fact, you go all the way\nback to the earliest days of computing,\n\n225\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.500\nI can't think of some of the earlier\ncomputers I think Univac was one\n\n226\n00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.610\nof them and stuff, but\nback to the 30s, essentially your\n\n227\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.970\ncomputer is a series of electrical\ncircuits that are turning on and off.\n\n228\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.260\nIn the early days of computing, one of the\nthings that they used computing systems\n\n229\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.730\nfor, very early computing systems,\nwas to automate circuit switching.\n\n230\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.971\nYou go back to the days and you look at\nsome of the old black and white shows,\n\n231\n00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:32.218\nor movies, if you will,\nyou remember the ladies,\n\n232\n00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:35.931\nthat were plugging into the switchboards,\nand they were connecting, if you will,\n\n233\n00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:37.701\nall of our different communications?\n\n234\n00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:39.690\nThey were our connectivity devices.\n\n235\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.800\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, are the CPUs, is that\nwhat they're still doing to this day,\n\n236\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.525\nbasically is just throwing a switch off\nand on that's just at a microscopic level?\n\n237\n00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:49.526\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and it's also at\na very fast level like you and\n\n238\n00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:51.460\nI have talked about in past episodes.\n\n239\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.020\nA single processor, or\nin a single second, excuse me,\n\n240\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.765\nwe're talking 4 billion calculations.\n\n241\n00:12:57.765 --> 00:13:00.001\n4 billion pulses of electricity.\n\n242\n00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:00.527\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot, with a b.\n\n243\n00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:01.239\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:01.739\n&gt;&gt; WIth a b.\n\n245\n00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:02.539\n&gt;&gt; Yeah with a capital B.\n\n246\n00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:03.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n247\n00:13:03.144 --> 00:13:04.840\n&gt;&gt; So, keep in mind that under the hood\n\n248\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.688\nthat's what we're seeing, and again,\nbecause we use a base10 system here,\n\n249\n00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:12.139\njust normal math, if you will,\nthat's what we're familiar with, and\n\n250\n00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:15.277\nwhen we denote it, it makes it\na little easier for humans to read.\n\n251\n00:13:15.277 --> 00:13:17.725\nNow there are some things that you have to\n\n252\n00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:22.477\nknow about base10 numbering systems\nbecause they might ask you on the exam to\n\n253\n00:13:22.477 --> 00:13:26.869\ntake that 32-bit number, those four\ndecimal blocks as we write it and\n\n254\n00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:31.540\ndenote it, and convert it over to binary.\nSo that's what we wanna look at a little\n\n255\n00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.912\nbit, and then we'll go a little bit more\ninto depth on what these individual blocks\n\n256\n00:13:35.912 --> 00:13:40.220\nand pieces mean, but we really wanna\nstart there, and it's gonna be important,\n\n257\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.656\nbecause as, like Dan said,\nyou go into your networking career,\n\n258\n00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:47.903\nthere's gonna be times when you will have\nto, and even sometimes from memory and\n\n259\n00:13:47.903 --> 00:13:52.150\nnot even writing it out on paper,\nconvert this from decimal to binary.\n\n260\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.110\nNow here at the A+ level guys we just\nwant you to know it conceptually,\n\n261\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.470\nwe want you to know what's going on so\nit make sense and\n\n262\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:02.240\nas you progress in your career you maybe\nmove into an MTA exam for Microsoft or\n\n263\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.860\nmaybe you go farther in CompT and\nmove into Net+ you will have to know it,\n\n264\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.690\nbecause we have to know a lot\nmore a little bit later.\n\n265\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.650\nSo going with the basics,\n\n266\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.168\nI wanna go back to our base10 and\nour base2 numbering systems.\n\n267\n00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:17.530\nNow, I wanna talk about\nsomething known as place values,\n\n268\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.410\nbecause place values are important\nwhen it comes to a single octet.\n\n269\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.336\nYou know, I said that an octet\nis a series of sequential bits,\n\n270\n00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:27.007\nand eight specifically.\n\n271\n00:14:27.007 --> 00:14:33.070\nI want you to take a number, in decimal,\nthat would be eight place values long.\n\n272\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.153\nIn fact, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n273\n00:14:35.153 --> 00:14:39.752\nSo in base10, maybe you remember\nthis from your basic math, base10,\n\n274\n00:14:39.752 --> 00:14:41.796\nwe have eight place values here.\n\n275\n00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:45.471\nSo if I was to write out a number,\nlet's say I don't know,\n\n276\n00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:50.421\nlet's say something like, one,\nhelp me with my numbers here, two, three,\n\n277\n00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:54.710\nfour, five, six, seven,\nlooks like we need one more there.\n\n278\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.121\nMaybe 10,\nI should have stuck with 10, right?\n\n279\n00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:02.028\nSo if I look at a number like this,\nthere's 10 place values, all right,\n\n280\n00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:06.121\nI have 10 million, and the reason I know\nhow to pronounce that is because I can\n\n281\n00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:10.213\nlook at the very first place value, in\nthis case from the right to the left, and\n\n282\n00:15:10.213 --> 00:15:13.623\nI could say, well, that first\nzero is in the one's place value,\n\n283\n00:15:13.623 --> 00:15:17.571\nand then we go 10's,\n100's, 1,000's, 10,000's.\n\n284\n00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:22.480\nThis is just basic base10's\ntypes of decimal notation.\n\n285\n00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.490\nIt's something that we're familiar with,\nhowever, when we look at binary, and\n\n286\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.472\nlet me go ahead and finish my diagram\nhere, because apparently I’m slacking.\n\n287\n00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:31.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we go,\n\n288\n00:15:31.612 --> 00:15:34.671\ncall it is a base2 because there's\ntwo possibilities, a zero or a one,\n\n289\n00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:36.425\nthe place values change a little bit, and\n\n290\n00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:39.033\nthis is where sometimes when you\nfirst see it, like Dan says,\n\n291\n00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:42.310\nmaybe this is the first time you're\nseeing it, it gets a little confusing.\n\n292\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.220\nWhat the heck is going on here and\nwhat are these numbers?\n\n293\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.449\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you only have a one and\na zero how the heck do you get up to 128?\n\n294\n00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:48.194\nBut that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's-\n\n295\n00:15:48.194 --> 00:15:49.922\n&gt;&gt; Is the value correct?\n\n296\n00:15:49.922 --> 00:15:54.254\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so if we go in fact lets\ntake a second and just expand a little bit\n\n297\n00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:58.012\nmore on that Dan, if we look that's what,\none to the power of zero?\n\n298\n00:15:58.012 --> 00:15:59.556\nRight, and\nwe look at the powers next to it.\n\n299\n00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:02.253\nIt's one to the power of one,\none to the power of two, right?\n\n300\n00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.613\nAnd we keep going all the way over,\nin this case,\n\n301\n00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:07.650\nif we get eight place values\nlong up to 10 million.\n\n302\n00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.590\nWell it's interesting,\nwhen you do this in binary,\n\n303\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.960\nyou're gonna say one to\nthe power of zero is what?\n\n304\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.860\nWell anything to the power of\nzero is gonna be one, right?\n\n305\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.080\nAnd then one to the power of one,\none to the power of, is that right?\n\n306\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.615\nNo, I'm sorry, two.\n\n307\n00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:21.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Two to the power of zero,\n\n308\n00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.119\nlet's get this right, Wes.\n\n309\n00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:26.158\nTwo to the power of zero,\ntwo to the power of one, and\n\n310\n00:16:26.158 --> 00:16:28.801\nthen we keep going all\nthe way over to 128.\n\n311\n00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:31.285\nNow the reason we are doing this\nis cuz I want you to understand.\n\n312\n00:16:31.285 --> 00:16:34.482\nRemember what we said,\nwhen we said what an octet is,\n\n313\n00:16:34.482 --> 00:16:37.625\nan octet essentially is eights,\nones, and zeros.\n\n314\n00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:40.355\nAll right, so we can go ahead and\nget back in here, and\n\n315\n00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:42.369\nfind out where we're going with this.\n\n316\n00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:46.056\nAll right, so if I look at an octet,\nI'm gonna be looking at let's say,\n\n317\n00:16:46.056 --> 00:16:47.580\nsomething like.\n\n318\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.690\nThis right here and\nlet me bump up that font size guys, so\n\n319\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.223\nyou can actually see that.\n\n320\n00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:54.874\nThere we go, all right.\n\n321\n00:16:54.874 --> 00:16:59.182\nAll right, so this is what one of those\nblocks would look like as the computer is\n\n322\n00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:00.335\nseeing it, right?\n\n323\n00:17:00.335 --> 00:17:03.120\nThey would see the eight\nbits in the octet.\n\n324\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.850\nWell, if I look, I want you to think\nback to our place values, right?\n\n325\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.660\nWe've got right here, we've got a 1\nplace value, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n326\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:16.178\nWell if you look at the binary system,\nthe base 2 numbering system,\n\n327\n00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:19.808\nthe place values look like,\nwork like this.\n\n328\n00:17:19.808 --> 00:17:24.260\n1, and then they double, 2,\n4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.\n\n329\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.930\nAgain, two to the power of zero,\n\n330\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.370\ntwo to the power of one, all the way\nout to two to the power of seven, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.180\nAnd I want you to know this chart,\nall right.\n\n332\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.260\nBecause the chart is gonna be very, very\nimportant in understanding how to take\n\n333\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.580\na decimal number, and\nconvert it to binary.\n\n334\n00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.990\nSo that's one of the things that we wanna\nstart out with when we look at our IP\n\n335\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.763\naddresses.\n\n336\n00:17:49.763 --> 00:17:53.501\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, so we're getting\nthe idea of the place values, and\n\n337\n00:17:53.501 --> 00:17:56.544\nhow we're coming up with\nthe binary numbering system.\n\n338\n00:17:56.544 --> 00:18:00.547\nBut how do we get that binary number into\nsomething like when we were looking at\n\n339\n00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:02.896\nthe IP address, it said, 10.0.42?\n\n340\n00:18:02.896 --> 00:18:04.420\nI wanted that 10, how do I get 10?\n\n341\n00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.850\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n342\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.020\ntake Dan's question there and\nlet's turn it into an example, all right?\n\n343\n00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.750\nSo let's go ahead, let's move back to our\nlittle diagram that we're working on,\n\n344\n00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.200\nour little spreadsheet.\n\n345\n00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.270\nAgain, let me kind of modify this, so\nwe can kinda see what's going on here.\n\n346\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.130\nLet me go ahead and select this,\n\n347\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.440\nand again doing this on the fly\nis always a great idea.\n\n348\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.388\nLive on camera here.\n\n349\n00:18:28.388 --> 00:18:30.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You guys get a chance to watch.\n\n350\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.278\n&gt;&gt; It always goes well [LAUGH].\n\n351\n00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly,\nyou get to watch me struggle here guys.\n\n352\n00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.760\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's do that, all right.\n\n353\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.160\nWe're gonna take this number first of all,\nand let's just go ahead and\n\n354\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.324\ntake that out of here, all right?\n\n355\n00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:43.890\nAnd what we wanna do, is we wanna\ngo ahead, and we wanna just say.\n\n356\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.810\nAll right, we're gonna look at\nthe first octet, right, and\n\n357\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.810\nwe'll take that 10 that Dan mentioned.\n\n358\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.580\nAll right, so we'll go ahead,\nand we'll do exactly that.\n\n359\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.450\nSo what we have to do to take that first\nblock, and in this case it was 10,\n\n360\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.090\nand converted over to eight\nbits of binary, right.\n\n361\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:05.642\nSo what we're seeing here is, confuse\nthis is number 10, not [CROSSTALK].\n\n362\n00:19:05.642 --> 00:19:06.510\nThank you, right?\n\n363\n00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.742\nSo let's go ahead and see that.\n\n364\n00:19:08.742 --> 00:19:11.977\nAll right, when you are going\nto do a conversion, all right,\n\n365\n00:19:11.977 --> 00:19:13.730\nof a decimal number into binary.\n\n366\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.900\nOne of the first things you'd have\nto understand are these place values\n\n367\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.610\nlike we mentioned.\n\n368\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.950\nI want you to commit them to memory,\nall right?\n\n369\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.095\nI want you to write them down.\n\n370\n00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:24.342\nWhen you go into the exam booth,\nand you push Start that exam,\n\n371\n00:19:24.342 --> 00:19:25.910\nI want you to write this down.\n\n372\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.460\nSo when you come to the networking sides,\nyour time is precious, right?\n\n373\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.230\nYou don't have to turn around and\nrewrite this.\n\n374\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.800\nSo it is important.\n\n375\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.050\nSo, the formula is very basic, and again\nif it's the first time you've seen it,\n\n376\n00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.610\nnothing seems basic, I understand,\nso don't take it for granted, right?\n\n377\n00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.931\nHere's how we do it, all right.\n\n378\n00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:47.015\nWhen you are going to essentially,\nconvert a decimal number into binary.\n\n379\n00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:51.007\nYou're gonna take these place\nvalues from left to right, and\n\n380\n00:19:51.007 --> 00:19:55.021\ntake that value and\nsubtract these place values one at a time.\n\n381\n00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:58.755\nNow, when you can use a place value,\nand what I mean by that,\n\n382\n00:19:58.755 --> 00:20:01.460\nwhen you could take that decimal number.\n\n383\n00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.350\nAnd you can subtract a place value\nfrom it, it becomes a binary 1.\n\n384\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.730\nNow, if you take that number and\ncome to a place value, and\n\n385\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.070\nthe place value is greater than a number,\nyou can't use it, right?\n\n386\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.570\nI can't subtract it, so\nit's gonna be a binary 0.\n\n387\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.690\nNow, you're gonna work\nthrough each place value,\n\n388\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.110\nand basically subtract\nall the way to the right.\n\n389\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.900\nThere are no remainders in this\nconversion, so if you get a remainder,\n\n390\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.640\nwhich I have on many occasions, I've\nlearned how horrible my math is, okay?\n\n391\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.180\nGo back and recalculate it.\n\n392\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.200\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n393\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.140\nIf you look at the very first octet here,\nif I was gonna take this decimal value 10,\n\n394\n00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.650\nand try to subtract 128 from it,\nwe know negative numbers, right?\n\n395\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:45.355\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n396\n00:20:45.355 --> 00:20:48.404\nSo, unfortunately,\nwe can't use that place value, so\n\n397\n00:20:48.404 --> 00:20:51.560\nwhat happens is this becomes\na binary zero for us.\n\n398\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.900\nAnd then I move to the next place value.\n\n399\n00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.030\nNow I can't subtract 64 from 10,\nso you'll see that hey,\n\n400\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.875\nthere's kind of a repetition here.\n\n401\n00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:05.120\nI can't use this place value either, so\nwe turn that bit, within the octet to a 0.\n\n402\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.890\nNotice I can't use 32,\nnotice I can't use 16.\n\n403\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.850\n&gt;&gt; An important thing\nhere to make sure you\n\n404\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.440\nunderstand that you're trying\nto subtract 128 from 10.\n\n405\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.042\nNot 10 from 128.\n\n406\n00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:17.097\n&gt;&gt; Did I say that way?\n\n407\n00:21:17.097 --> 00:21:18.123\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No, you didn't,\n\n408\n00:21:18.123 --> 00:21:22.332\nI'm just making sure that the audience\nout there is Following along, because for\n\n409\n00:21:22.332 --> 00:21:25.086\na second there, I was going,\nwhat's going on?\n\n410\n00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:26.321\nI see, that's right.\n\n411\n00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:30.562\nYou have to put the 10 on top of the 128,\nnot the 128 on top of the 10,\n\n412\n00:21:30.562 --> 00:21:31.912\nwhich would work fine.\n\n413\n00:21:31.912 --> 00:21:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's why he's getting 0,\n\n414\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.430\nbecause 128 minus 10, that doesn't work.\n\n415\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.270\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n416\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:36.944\n&gt;&gt; Or the other way around [LAUGH].\n\n417\n00:21:36.944 --> 00:21:38.024\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha [LAUGH].\n\n418\n00:21:38.024 --> 00:21:41.630\n&gt;&gt; See how easy it is to get like,\nwhoa, we're on left field here.\n\n419\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.840\n&gt;&gt; It really, really is.\n\n420\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.560\nSo make sure that when you're subtracting\nthe decimal number, just like Dan said.\n\n421\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.930\nPut it on top, and\nthen try to subtract the place value.\n\n422\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:56.190\nIf you can't, it becomes a binary zero and\nmove to the next place value.\n\n423\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.137\nSo notice that I can't put 10 on top\nof 16, right, and turn around and\n\n424\n00:22:00.137 --> 00:22:01.040\nsubtract 16.\n\n425\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.160\nSo because of that what happens,\nit becomes a binary 0.\n\n426\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.288\nBut I want you to notice something,\nwhen I get to 8, if I was to put.\n\n427\n00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Not 120 [LAUGH].\n\n428\n00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Not 120, if I just put 10 over it,\nI could subtract that, right?\n\n429\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.390\nI could subtract 8 from 10,\nit works, right.\n\n430\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:22.950\nSo what happens 10 that becomes a very\nfirst binary 1 within these 8 bit octet.\n\n431\n00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.885\nAll right, now when that happens,\n\n432\n00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:28.055\nI want you to keep in mind that\nwe now have a reminder of two.\n\n433\n00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:30.667\n&gt;&gt; And now [INAUDIBLE] to\non a further clarification,\n\n434\n00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:33.290\nwe're not saying that you\nshould put a two there.\n\n435\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.030\n&gt;&gt; No, that's right.\n\n436\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.542\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're not taking what it equals what 10\n\n437\n00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:38.770\nminus 8 equals and putting it there.\n\n438\n00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.539\nWe're just saying,\ncan I subtract 8 from 10?\n\n439\n00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:45.160\nIf it's true, yes, put a 1,\nif it's false, put a 0.\n\n440\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.182\nThat's where we getting our numbers.\n\n441\n00:22:46.182 --> 00:22:49.460\n&gt;&gt; You got it, nailed it,\nthat's exactly what it is, okay.\n\n442\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.120\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take that remainder 2, all right?\n\n443\n00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.160\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n444\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.740\nwe're gonna say, hey is it true or false\nthat I could subtract 4 from my value 2?\n\n445\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.530\nAnd the answer is false.\n\n446\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:06.140\nSo if it's false, that means we're not\ngonna put the remainder like Dan said.\n\n447\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.510\nWe're gonna put the binary value,\nand that's gonna be 0, right?\n\n448\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.450\nAnd then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take and we're gonna put 2 over 2 in\n\n449\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:18.580\nthis place value, moving each bit\nwithin the octet across to the right.\n\n450\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.400\nOkay, now notice I can subtract 2 from 2,\nand that makes it true, right?\n\n451\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.560\nSo that becomes a binary 1.\n\n452\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:30.370\nNow, notice that 2 from 2 leaves\nme with a remainder of nothing.\n\n453\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.480\nIt's very, very easy that the process,\nin theory, is the same.\n\n454\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.220\nIf I say, I've got a 0,\ncan I subtract 1 from it?\n\n455\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.900\nAnd the answer is no, well, it's still\ngonna be the same formula, right?\n\n456\n00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.765\nThat value is going to become\nessentially nothing more than a zero.\n\n457\n00:23:46.765 --> 00:23:51.060\nSo notice that we went through each\none of these place values, and\n\n458\n00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.680\nwhat we end up coming up with is 0,\n0, 0, 0 in the first four bits.\n\n459\n00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.103\n1, 0, 1, 0.\n\n460\n00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:03.158\nSo 10 converted from the decimal\nnotation essentially\n\n461\n00:24:03.158 --> 00:24:07.750\ninto the binary notation is very simple,\nright?\n\n462\n00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.660\nBut let's not stop there,\nlet's go ahead and let's try another one.\n\n463\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.091\nYou might find out as you\nwork through your networking,\n\n464\n00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:16.648\nyou might find a value of 192, right?\n\n465\n00:24:16.648 --> 00:24:17.930\nLet's give you another example.\n\n466\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.830\nThis is a common octet in\nyour home networks, and\n\n467\n00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.150\nyou'll see why coming up\nhere in later portions of\n\n468\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.270\nthis little potentially mini series\n[LAUGH] that we're gonna run here.\n\n469\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.121\n&gt;&gt; Let's do 168, Wes.\n\n470\n00:24:28.121 --> 00:24:29.473\n&gt;&gt; You wanna do 168?\n\n471\n00:24:29.473 --> 00:24:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think 168's more fun,\ncuz 192 is kinda easy.\n\n472\n00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.611\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so 168, now we're really\ngonna see how bad my math is.\n\n473\n00:24:36.611 --> 00:24:38.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll do 168 if you'll pull out\n\n474\n00:24:38.212 --> 00:24:38.843\nthe calculator.\n\n475\n00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:40.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, I got the computing.\n\n476\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.009\nHere it is.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n477\n00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:42.815\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n478\n00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:46.117\nwe're gonna take 168, and\nwe're gonna challenge Dan here.\n\n479\n00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:52.102\nWe're gonna say, okay, can I subtract 128\nfrom that decimal value 168, all right?\n\n480\n00:24:52.102 --> 00:24:52.768\n&gt;&gt; I sure can.\n\n481\n00:24:52.768 --> 00:24:55.900\n&gt;&gt; And the answer,\njust like Dan said, is yes.\n\n482\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.410\nSo that makes it a binary\n1 within that place value.\n\n483\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:05.680\nNow understand that what\nwe have left is 40, right?\n\n484\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.593\nI don't know about that, right?\n\n485\n00:25:07.593 --> 00:25:10.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have 40 left, all right?\n\n486\n00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.320\nNow I'm gonna just move to the next octet,\nand we're gonna, or the next bit and\n\n487\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.942\nI'm gonna put 40 over there.\n\n488\n00:25:15.942 --> 00:25:17.774\nCan I subtract 64 from 40?\n\n489\n00:25:17.774 --> 00:25:20.140\nAnd the answer is, well, no, right?\n\n490\n00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:25.310\nSo if I cannot use that place value\nby subtracting it, it is false.\n\n491\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.190\nIt means it's a 0.\n\n492\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.767\nAnd then we're gonna move to the next bit,\nall right, and we're gonna have 40.\n\n493\n00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:33.352\nAnd can we subtract 32 from 40?\n\n494\n00:25:33.352 --> 00:25:36.120\nWell the answer is true, yes we can.\n\n495\n00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.988\nSo that becomes a binary 1, and\nthat leaves us with a remainder of 8.\n\n496\n00:25:39.988 --> 00:25:41.108\nAnd I told you I might\nbe able to do this one.\n\n497\n00:25:41.108 --> 00:25:41.828\n&gt;&gt; You did, you did.\n\n498\n00:25:41.828 --> 00:25:44.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm checking this map here.\n\n499\n00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:45.958\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, it is.\n\n500\n00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:47.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, good, good.\n\n501\n00:25:47.192 --> 00:25:49.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n502\n00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.550\nnow what we have is our remainder, right?\n\n503\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.540\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll move over to the next bit, right?\n\n504\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.335\nNow we have our remainder of 8.\n\n505\n00:25:56.335 --> 00:26:00.510\nAnd the question is, can I take 16 and\nsubtract it from my remainder of 8?\n\n506\n00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:05.305\nAnd we can't have negative numbers here,\nthat's a must, no negative numbers and\n\n507\n00:26:05.305 --> 00:26:07.085\nno remainders, right?\n\n508\n00:26:07.085 --> 00:26:09.195\nWhen we get down to the last-\n&gt;&gt; That will get your hand slapped.\n\n509\n00:26:09.195 --> 00:26:12.688\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nthe ruler is coming out.\n\n510\n00:26:12.688 --> 00:26:13.288\n&gt;&gt; Beware knuckles.\n\n511\n00:26:13.288 --> 00:26:14.645\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n512\n00:26:14.645 --> 00:26:19.065\nSo we can't use it,\nbecomes a binary zero, all right.\n\n513\n00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:21.795\nNow we have to keep taking\nthat remainder of 8, and\n\n514\n00:26:21.795 --> 00:26:23.930\nwe're going to subtract 8 from 8.\n\n515\n00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.630\nAnd we know that we can do that, right?\n\n516\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.350\nSo that is going to be true,\nits gonna be a binary 1.\n\n517\n00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.540\nNow notice, and let me go ahead and\n\n518\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.790\nkind of zero these out here guys so\nwe don't get, I don't get confused.\n\n519\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.930\nNotice that we have a remainder of 0.\n\n520\n00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.370\nThe formula is still the same.\n\n521\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.935\nIt doesn't matter where within these 8\nbits you get within these place values,\n\n522\n00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:45.830\nif I have 0,\nI cannot subtract 4 from 0, right?\n\n523\n00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.653\nSo that's gonna be a 0.\n\n524\n00:26:47.653 --> 00:26:49.090\nAgain wash, rinse, repeat.\n\n525\n00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.950\nGuys, gals out there,\nI understand it's a little redundant but\n\n526\n00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.350\ntrust me, it'll start clicking, and\nyou guys, it'll make sense to you.\n\n527\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.010\nNotice I can't use the 0 or the 2 place\nvalue cuz I can't subtract 2 from\n\n528\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:05.000\nmy remainder of nothing,\nunless you're my bank account.\n\n529\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.989\nSo I put 0, all right?\n\n530\n00:27:06.989 --> 00:27:09.191\nAnd apparently I'm changing\nthe place value's value.\n\n531\n00:27:09.191 --> 00:27:10.031\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n[LAUGH]\n\n532\n00:27:10.031 --> 00:27:10.531\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n533\n00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.451\nSee, he was\n\n534\n00:27:11.451 --> 00:27:12.478\nright.\nHe is gonna\n\n535\n00:27:12.478 --> 00:27:13.348\nchallenge me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n536\n00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:15.342\n&gt;&gt; All right, notice the same thing goes,\n\n537\n00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:20.604\nladies and gents out there, with a 0.\nI can't subtract 1 from a remainder of 0,\n\n538\n00:27:20.604 --> 00:27:23.270\nso it becomes a 0 as well.\n\n539\n00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.985\nAll right,\nnow when we wanna look at something,\n\n540\n00:27:25.985 --> 00:27:30.105\na decimal number like 168 in an octet\nconverted over to a binary value.\n\n541\n00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:34.089\nWell, we get these 8 bits, right,\n\n542\n00:27:34.089 --> 00:27:37.950\nand you can see 10101000.\n\n543\n00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.277\nThat is an octet equivalent, if you will,\n\n544\n00:27:42.277 --> 00:27:46.253\nin binary to the decimal value 168.\n\n545\n00:27:46.253 --> 00:27:50.331\n&gt;&gt; Wes, that was fantastic demonstration,\ncuz this can be a very challenging thing,\n\n546\n00:27:50.331 --> 00:27:51.947\nespecially to the uninitiated.\n\n547\n00:27:51.947 --> 00:27:55.277\nThis is the first time you've ever had\nto do any kinda binary conversion in\n\n548\n00:27:55.277 --> 00:27:55.823\nyour life.\n\n549\n00:27:55.823 --> 00:27:58.730\nIt could be like, what are we even doing,\nthis makes no sense.\n\n550\n00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.870\nI heard math, that already gave me\nthe sweats, I'm already freaking out.\n\n551\n00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.640\nBut it's not difficult math, and\nif you know exactly what we're doing and\n\n552\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.830\nwhen we're doing it,\nit becomes very simple.\n\n553\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.134\nAnd the more you do it,\nthe more intuitive it even becomes.\n\n554\n00:28:10.134 --> 00:28:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so some of the big things to\nremember, remember these place values,\n\n555\n00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.590\nguys, gals.\n\n556\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.250\nWrite them down.\n\n557\n00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.560\nWe've both done this when\nwe were first learning.\n\n558\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.170\nWe had to.\n\n559\n00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.200\nYou have to commit them to memory.\n\n560\n00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.650\nIt is very simple if you remember\nif you start from the right,\n\n561\n00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.300\n1, and then double it out 8 times to 128.\n\n562\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.560\nRemember that when you are subtracting it,\n\n563\n00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.470\nI want you to also keep in mind\nsubtract from the left to the right.\n\n564\n00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.144\nOne of the last things\nI'd like to show you,\n\n565\n00:28:36.144 --> 00:28:38.740\nif we can go back to\nour binary number here.\n\n566\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.581\nIn order to go the other way, all right?\n\n567\n00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:46.110\nIf you have a binary value,\nthis is why we keep stressing the point.\n\n568\n00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:51.515\nWrite these place values out,\nput the binary number under each 8 bits,\n\n569\n00:28:51.515 --> 00:28:54.806\nand add every one of the 1s back up,\nright?\n\n570\n00:28:54.806 --> 00:28:58.635\nSo Dan if you'll break out your calculator\nhere just because my math is horrible\n\n571\n00:28:58.635 --> 00:28:59.280\n&gt;&gt; Ready to go.\n\n572\n00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead,\nlet's add 8, let's add 32, and\n\n573\n00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.660\nlet's add 128 tell me what the value is.\n\n574\n00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.286\n&gt;&gt; The grand total is 168.\n\n575\n00:29:09.286 --> 00:29:09.934\nLook at that.\n\n576\n00:29:09.934 --> 00:29:15.066\n&gt;&gt; 168, so keep in mind once you know how\nto convert it one way, it is simplistic\n\n577\n00:29:15.066 --> 00:29:20.150\nto convert it back the other way as\nlong as you know these place values.\n\n578\n00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:20.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n579\n00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.490\nthe math like I said, trust me, math,\nI started going, no, he said math.\n\n580\n00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.740\nIt's gonna be tough,\nit's gonna be horrible right?\n\n581\n00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.200\nBut it's not anything that none of\nus learned in fifth grade, even.\n\n582\n00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.790\nYou know what I mean?\n\n583\n00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:36.200\nIt's very simple math, adding and\nsubtracting, knowing when to do which.\n\n584\n00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.030\nSo if I'm converting one way or the other,\n\n585\n00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.960\nI have to know to add if I want to create\na decimal value out of a binary number,\n\n586\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.390\nand subtracting for taking a binary\nnumber and converting it to decimal.\n\n587\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.760\nSo there we go, very simple stuff.\n\n588\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.770\nListen, I know we have more\ncharacteristics of TCP/IP and\n\n589\n00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.770\nnetworking that we have to go through,\nbut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n590\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.440\nSo we'll have to come back for a part two.\n\n591\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.660\nHopefully, you'll join us there.\n\n592\n00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.600\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.394\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n594\n00:30:00.394 --> 00:30:02.779\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n595\n00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:08.720\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n596\n00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.345\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

all those acronyms out at\nthe same time you are god amongst humans.\n\n10\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.233\n[LAUGH] That is our good friend Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.561\nWes, welcome back man, how's it going.\n\n12\n00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.070\nLooking forward to continuing on in\nour little TCP IP mini series and\n\n14\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.440\nwell, there's a lot of great information.\n\n15\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.647\nAnd we really want you to have a good\nfoundation so, again, this could run and\n\n16\n00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:48.999\nmost likely will run multiple parts here.\n\n17\n00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.296\nAnd speaking of multiple parts here,\n\n18\n00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:55.694\nin part two we are going to continue\non when it comes to IPv4 addressing.\n\n19\n00:00:55.694 --> 00:01:00.176\nNow, in the first episode we talked\na little bit about the format of IPv4.\n\n20\n00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:04.492\nAnd we're going to continue along,\none of the things that we really spent\n\n21\n00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:08.530\nthe majority of the time is how to\ndo conversion of decimal notation,\n\n22\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.290\ndata decimal notation.\n\n23\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.460\nTo binary and\n\n24\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840\nthen finished it up with kinda bringing\nit back the other way going from binary\n\n25\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.360\nformat back in decimal because it could be\nsomething that they throw you on the exam.\n\n26\n00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.980\nNow, this will be yesterday's news,\nas you move in to more advanced training.\n\n27\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.470\nAnd when I say advanced training I'm not\ntalking really advanced, but as you move\n\n28\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.040\nthrough your IT career guys and gals out\nthere, do not let it intimidate you.\n\n29\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.650\nUnderstand you can do this.\n\n30\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.300\nJust keep looking at it and looking at it.\n\n31\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.779\nSo in this episode, we're gonna start out\nby continuing along in an IPv4 address.\n\n32\n00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:46.590\nAnd kind of showing you, really,\nthe IPv4 address, it's characteristics.\n\n33\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.040\nIts DNA, right?\n\n34\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.440\nSo let’s go ahead and\nlet’s talk a little bit more about IP.\n\n35\n00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.083\nNow, we said in the first part that IP\nit is responsible for basically sending,\n\n36\n00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.917\ngetting our information to\nthe right destination, if you will.\n\n37\n00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:04.533\nAnd it’s really about addressing,\nwhen it comes down to it, I don’t know if\n\n38\n00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:08.390\nit’s safe to say that it’s responsible for\ngetting it to the right destination.\n\n39\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.616\nIt just shows you where the destination\nis, right, like a mailing address.\n\n40\n00:02:12.616 --> 00:02:16.996\nSo, we, basically, we put a mailing\naddress on a piece of snail mail,\n\n41\n00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:20.210\nwe put that letter,\nif you will, into our mailbox.\n\n42\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.845\nAnd when the carrier comes by,\nthey could look at it,\n\n43\n00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.540\nthey could put it within\ntheir networks and they know,\n\n44\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.955\nwhat their infrastructure that they have,\nwhere it needs to end up.\n\n45\n00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.685\nWhat mailbox does it need to end up at?\n\n46\n00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:36.182\nSo now we wanna kinda look at that\nletter as it relates to IPv4 and\n\n47\n00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:40.950\ntalk about the DNA, if you will,\nthe portions of an IPv4 address.\n\n48\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.910\nBecause believe it or not even though\nwe see those four octets, right,\n\n49\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.280\nexpressed in dotted decimal notation,\nthe four individual blocks, right?\n\n50\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.238\nEight bits under the hood.\n\n51\n00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:53.507\nIn binary, what we see is four\nblocks of decimal values.\n\n52\n00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:57.989\nKeep in mind that it is comprised\nof a couple of portions, right?\n\n53\n00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.836\nAnd it's not so easy to tell just\nkinda looking at it, if you will,\n\n54\n00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:04.270\nwhat those portions are.\n\n55\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.460\nSo that's kinda what we're\ngonna focus on in this episode.\n\n56\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.460\nAll right, so when you look at\na 32-bit identifier, that is IPB4,\n\n57\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.030\nI want you to understand and kinda got a\nlittle diagram here to kinda explain this.\n\n58\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.280\nIt is really composed of two\ndifferent portions, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120\nAnd we're gonna kinda compare those\ntwo continuing along with that line of\n\n60\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.300\nthe mail carrier system so that there's\nan addressing system that you guys and\n\n61\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.720\ngals out there are very familiar with.\n\n62\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.877\nAnd it doesn't matter if you're here in\nthe states or you're here, maybe some of\n\n63\n00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:34.741\nour European brothers and sisters\nout there in other countries, right?\n\n64\n00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:38.720\nThere's some kind of mailing system\nthat you have that you can look\n\n65\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.290\nat an address and you can kind of tell\nwhat those components are, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.870\nSo when we look at an IPv4 address, it's\ncomprised of two components, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.170\nTwo components, portions if you will,\nor identifiers, identifiers, portions,\n\n68\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.730\nguys, know that they're synonymous.\n\n69\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.650\nDon't let that fool you, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.290\nAnd I'm gonna use them interchangeably\njust so we can get it in our minds.\n\n71\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.190\nAnd kind of acclimate ourselves to\nthis kind of jargon if you will.\n\n72\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.900\nSo what portions are we talking about?\n\n73\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.920\nWe're talking about what's known as\na network portion or network ID,\n\n74\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.120\nnetwork identifier, and a device or\nnode identifier, a device or node portion.\n\n75\n00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.885\nNow it's not necessarily that\nwe take those 32 bits and\n\n76\n00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:20.335\nwe divide them right in half.\n\n77\n00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:22.238\n16 on one side, 16 on the other.\n\n78\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:27.016\nNow which side of the river you're\ngonna be standing on really depends on\n\n79\n00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:30.697\nanother thing that we'll talk about,\na subnet mask and\n\n80\n00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:34.700\nhow it is applied to your IPv4 address,\nall right.\n\n81\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.250\nNow let's talk a little bit about\nthat network ID and what it means for\n\n82\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.140\nus, all right.\n\n83\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.280\nEvery computer that is on a network\nthat is going to be considered to be\n\n84\n00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.970\non the same network has to share\nthe same network identifier.\n\n85\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.830\nIt's how we identify that a computer\nis joined to the same network.\n\n86\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.930\nNow, another thing I want you to keep\nin mind is that every device that\n\n87\n00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.210\nis on a network has to have\na unique node identifier.\n\n88\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.380\nYou might hear the term host identifier,\nhost portion, node Id, node portion right.\n\n89\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.849\nAll synonymous terms,\ndo not let this confuse you.\n\n90\n00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.803\nAll right and you have to be,\nit has to be unique.\n\n91\n00:05:11.803 --> 00:05:16.370\nAll right I can't have two devices,\nlet's say Dan and my laptop right here.\n\n92\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.910\nIt can't have the same node identifier and\nbe considered to be unique.\n\n93\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.030\nRight because there will be\nsome delivery conflict right.\n\n94\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.270\nSame thing if you were talking about\ndelivering a piece of mail, and\n\n95\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.810\nthe mail carrier gets to the street and\nsays, well wait a second.\n\n96\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.340\nOn this street, we have two houses\nthat have the identical house numbers.\n\n97\n00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.710\nAnd that's what I want you to think about\nthese portions and how they're comparable.\n\n98\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.390\nThink about,\nwe talk about a mailing address, right?\n\n99\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.994\nWe're going to look at just\nthe house number, if you will, and\n\n100\n00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:44.938\nthen the street name.\n\n101\n00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:48.644\nIf you want to consider a house\nto be on the same street as\n\n102\n00:05:48.644 --> 00:05:53.850\nanother house there is something\nthey have to share between them.\n\n103\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.297\nAnd don't worry about duplexes and\ntriplexes,\n\n104\n00:05:55.297 --> 00:05:56.574\nwe are not even going\nto go there right now.\n\n105\n00:05:56.574 --> 00:06:00.310\nWe're talking about unique\nindividual houses right?\n\n106\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.858\nFirst of all, if they're gonna be\nconsidered to be on the same street,\n\n107\n00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:04.351\nthey have to have the same street number.\n\n108\n00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:05.927\nThat's just a must right?\n\n109\n00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:11.151\nI can't go, to let's say,\n22nd Avenue and expect that\n\n110\n00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:18.411\na house that is going to be on 23rd Avenue\nis considered to be on the same street.\n\n111\n00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.836\nThey have to have the same street name.\n\n112\n00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:24.573\nThat's the same thing as a network\nportion, If a computer's going to be, or\n\n113\n00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:27.217\na device is going to be\nconsidered on the same network,\n\n114\n00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:30.220\nit has to have the same network ID or\nnetwork portion.\n\n115\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.955\nThe other thing that we\nalso have to keep in mind,\n\n116\n00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:37.294\nis that just like we're talking about\nnetworks, when we talk about a house or\n\n117\n00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:40.871\non the same street,\nhouses have to have unique numbers right?\n\n118\n00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:43.760\nThey have to have a unique house number.\n\n119\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.420\nThey can't have the same right?\n\n120\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.660\nCuz that would make some conflicts.\n\n121\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.150\nSo at its very basic level I want\nyou to think of an IPv4 address\n\n122\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.900\nas having those two portions\nthat are really akin and\n\n123\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.770\ncomparable to, if you will, to a street\nname and a house number, all right?\n\n124\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.830\nNow, there is an interesting thing that\nwe also have to find out is, well,\n\n125\n00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.474\nhow do we know?\n\n126\n00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:07.594\nWell, let's go ahead and\nlet's continue on,\n\n127\n00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.561\nwe kinda do a little bit of a review,\nright?\n\n128\n00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:12.770\nSo if I have some IP addresses here,\nright?\n\n129\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.920\nThese are just some basic examples.\n\n130\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.678\nI know that they have to have the same\nnetwork identifier to be considered on\n\n131\n00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:20.896\nthe same network.\n\n132\n00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:26.040\nI also know that they have to\nhave unique node identifiers.\n\n133\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.160\nLet me make sure I said that right.\n\n134\n00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.370\nThey have to have the same network\nidentifier to be considered on the same\n\n135\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.640\nnetwork and they also have to be\nunique within that network, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.860\nSo how do we tell?\n\n137\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.694\nAs a recap, if you remember, an IP\naddress is nothing more than a 32-bit\n\n138\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:45.764\nidentifier again expressed in data\ndecimal notation and here's an example of\n\n139\n00:07:45.764 --> 00:07:51.014\nthe individual bits, the individual\noctets, right, for a total of 32 bits.\n\n140\n00:07:51.014 --> 00:07:56.232\nNow keep in mind again, again that\nit's divided into four 8-bit blocks,\n\n141\n00:07:56.232 --> 00:07:59.981\neach called an octet And\nlike we seen in the first part,\n\n142\n00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:03.620\nwe have our decimal and\nwe have our binary.\n\n143\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.110\nNow when we talk about the two portions,\nagain, keep in mind that some of these\n\n144\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.630\nbits underneath form the network\nidentifier, the network portion.\n\n145\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.990\nSome of these bits uniquely\nidentify the host or\n\n146\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.570\nthat device within the network as well.\n\n147\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.200\nSo I ask you again,\nhow do we divide those two portions?\n\n148\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.880\nAll right?\n\n149\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.020\nWe do that with something\nknown as a subnet mask.\n\n150\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.940\nNow I want you to understand that\na subnet mask essentially is\n\n151\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.530\na 32-bit binary number as well, all right?\n\n152\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.100\nYou might hear it called a binary mask\nas well, but don't worry about that now.\n\n153\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.950\nNow understand the 32-bit binary value.\n\n154\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.550\nAlright.\n\n155\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.880\nIt's also expressed in decimal notation\nfor the same reasons that we take\n\n156\n00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.160\nan IP address and express it in\na dotted decimal value, right?\n\n157\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.390\nBecause, as humans, it is a lot easier\nto remember a number like 255 than\n\n158\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.640\nit is to remember, well I guess one.\n\n159\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.690\n&gt;&gt; That wouldn't be too difficult.\n\n160\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.802\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that wouldn't be too difficult.\n\n161\n00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:55.341\nSo all ones.\n\n162\n00:08:55.341 --> 00:08:57.790\nOnce it starts getting into 223,\n\n163\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.820\nthat is when it starts getting hard,\n&gt;&gt; How do we figure out what that\n\n164\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.405\nis, right?\n\n165\n00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:05.330\nNow, there is something to understand.\n\n166\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.440\nA subnet mask is not an IP address,\nthat is not what it is.\n\n167\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.630\nIt has a specific functionality\nwhen applied to an IP address.\n\n168\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.823\nWhat the subnet mask does is it\ndivides those portions, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:21.992\nAnd what we mean by that\nis that it tells me,\n\n170\n00:09:21.992 --> 00:09:25.880\nwhat are the network bits and\nwhat are the node bits?\n\n171\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.294\nSo how does he do that?\n\n172\n00:09:27.294 --> 00:09:29.378\nAll right, well,\nI want you to think of this way.\n\n173\n00:09:29.378 --> 00:09:30.327\nA subnet mask,\n\n174\n00:09:30.327 --> 00:09:36.250\nyou might see that we talked about\n255.255.255.0 is being a subnet mask.\n\n175\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.302\nIf I was to break that down with the chart\nthat Dan and I explained in the very first\n\n176\n00:09:40.302 --> 00:09:43.281\nepisode, you would see that\nwould be a series of one bits.\n\n177\n00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:51.070\nA single 255 is the largest value\nyou can have inside an 8-bit octet.\n\n178\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.220\nAnd why is that?\n\n179\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.160\nWell it's all ones, right.\n\n180\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.371\nAnd if we were to go back to our\ndecimals or our place values,\n\n181\n00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:05.833\nand we were to turn every one of those\nbits into a one and then add up 128,\n\n182\n00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:11.069\n64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, we'd get 255.\n\n183\n00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.572\nAll right?\n\n184\n00:10:11.572 --> 00:10:17.485\nAnd that's important because underneath\nin the binary to be a valid subnet mask,\n\n185\n00:10:17.485 --> 00:10:21.130\nwe have to have what's\nknown as contiguous 1s.\n\n186\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.030\nAnd what we mean by that is we\ncannot have 0s interspersed, right?\n\n187\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.890\nI can't say that this is going to\nbe a subnet mask and do something,\n\n188\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.790\nlet's say, like this.\n\n189\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.410\nWhere we have 1010, whoops, and\na dash, and maybe an emoticon.\n\n190\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.450\n&gt;&gt; Can't use dashes either [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.125\n&gt;&gt; Can't use dashes either.\n\n192\n00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.850\nThanks Dan, I appreciate that [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.750\nCan't have emoticons in there, I mean.\n\n194\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.750\nSo, that can't be a subnet mask,\nthis while 32-bit value.\n\n195\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.500\nBecause notice how I\nhave some zeros in there.\n\n196\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.580\nWe can't have that, right.\n\n197\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:54.070\nSo understand that a subnet mask in\nthe binary is contiguous one bits.\n\n198\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:11:01.230\nAnd that's why commonly you\nsee 255.255.255.0, right.\n\n199\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:07.198\nBecause if you take those decimal values\nand you convert them into binary,\n\n200\n00:11:07.198 --> 00:11:10.999\nyou will see that is\na contiguous set of 1 bits.\n\n201\n00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:12.019\nNow, for the exam,\n\n202\n00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:15.397\nwhat I want you to understand is\nthat when a subnet mask is applied.\n\n203\n00:11:15.397 --> 00:11:17.607\nThere's something that we're gonna\ntalk about here in a second.\n\n204\n00:11:17.607 --> 00:11:21.407\nWhen a subnet mask is\napplied to an IP address,\n\n205\n00:11:21.407 --> 00:11:25.317\neverywhere we see the 1 bits, all right.\n\n206\n00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:31.700\nThat portion of your IPv4 address\nis called the network portion.\n\n207\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.060\nAll right, so if we were to take this and\nwe were to lay these in\n\n208\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:40.170\nbinary on top of each other, IPV 4\naddress, like we have here on the top,\n\n209\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.150\na subnet mask in its binary\nvalue under it, in the ones.\n\n210\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.150\nIt's very simplistic in this case because\nwe want you to know that wherever I see\n\n211\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.910\nones, those octets in the IPV 4\naddress are your network portion.\n\n212\n00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.950\nNow we wanna know how that's happening.\n\n213\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.137\nBecause what's interesting is that,\nremember I told you a subnet mask has\n\n214\n00:12:02.137 --> 00:12:06.203\na specific purpose that it identifies\nhow to divide this IPV 4 address.\n\n215\n00:12:06.203 --> 00:12:07.770\nSo how does it do that?\n\n216\n00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.750\nWell it does that through something\nknown as binary anding, all right.\n\n217\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.350\nAnding not adding, right?\n\n218\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.980\nAnd thank goodness because\nadding is not my strong suit.\n\n219\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.920\nAll right.\n\n220\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.840\nSo what are we talking about\nwhen we talk about anding?\n\n221\n00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.780\nWell, in anding there are only two\npossible values you can get, right?\n\n222\n00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.600\nWhich is kind of interesting and\nconvenient for\n\n223\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.460\nbinary cuz there's only two\npossible values, right.\n\n224\n00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.630\n&gt;&gt; That's a match made in heaven.\n\n225\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthat's a great way to think about it.\n\n226\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.470\nSo, how do we achieve these values,\nall right?\n\n227\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.470\nWell, I want you to know,\nthere's a small mathematical formula.\n\n228\n00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.240\nAnd I know, ladies and gentlemen out\nthere, of course, we've been talking a lot\n\n229\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.860\nof math in here and\nyou guys have seen me type on top of it.\n\n230\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.130\nSo, not a really good subject for me.\n\n231\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.840\nTyping and math at the same time, right?\n\n232\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.250\nBut we're gonna take a stab at it.\n\n233\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.360\nAll right, when we talk about binary\nending, what we're talking about is a 1\n\n234\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.460\nanded, not added,\nanded to a one equals a one.\n\n235\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.890\nAny other-\n&gt;&gt; Combination.\n\n236\n00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Combination, thank you, equals a zero.\n\n237\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.470\nAnd what I mean by that is if we were\nto zoom in to a zero anded to a one,\n\n238\n00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.260\nit equals a zero.\n\n239\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.050\nAll right, if we talk about let me see,\nI don't have an example of one,\n\n240\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.550\nif we were to talk about.\n\n241\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.190\nThere we go, there we go.\n\n242\n00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.365\nThat's another great one,\nso if we talk about a zero.\n\n243\n00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:29.310\nAnded to a zero, we get a zero, all right?\n\n244\n00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.930\nIf we look at a one, anded to a zero,\nwe also get a zero, all right?\n\n245\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.210\nSo keep in mind, the only way, when you\ntake an IPv4 address and apply the one\n\n246\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.560\nbits and a subnet mask to it, that you\ncan get a one is anding on one and a one.\n\n247\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.900\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's kind of a filtering mechanism for\n\n248\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.760\nfiguring out what your network portion\nof your IP address actually is.\n\n249\n00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.944\nSo if you throw that, if you break\neverything down to binary digits,\n\n250\n00:13:56.944 --> 00:13:58.690\nto a binary number.\n\n251\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.210\nYou got all those 1's and you throw\nyour actual IP address on top of that,\n\n252\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.440\nyou throw that our in binary,\nyou start doing that anding process,\n\n253\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.510\nyou're gonna come up with your network ID.\n\n254\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.700\nCorrect?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n255\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.500\nAnd let's go ahead take that\nback to the street address.\n\n256\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.490\nWhy would that be?\n\n257\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.060\nAll right, so I'm gonna do a little\nmodification to our slide here and\n\n258\n00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.470\nwe'll kinda move this off to the side.\n\n259\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.980\nAnd I want you think about something,\nall right?\n\n260\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.650\nIf I have three street addresses,\nright, I have 1,000 and\n\n261\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.770\nwe'll say northwest,\nI don't know, 91st street.\n\n262\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.620\nAll right I'm just making this up\noff the top of my head here, right?\n\n263\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:46.340\nSo we have a 1000 let's 10\nNorth west 91 street as well.\n\n264\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.270\nAnd then we have I don't know\nlet's say the last one here is\n\n265\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:55.780\ngoing to be let's say 1012 92 street.\n\n266\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.780\nAll right, now if you think about your\njust common addressing system, All right.\n\n267\n00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.330\nWhich portions of this address do I\n\n268\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.290\nreally need to determine whether these\nhouses are on the same street or not?\n\n269\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.730\nAll right, well I don't really\nneed these numbers, right?\n\n270\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.940\nAnd in fact, let me go ahead and\ntake this out.\n\n271\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.030\nAll right.\n\n272\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.757\nDo I know by looking at the house number\nif these houses are on the same street?\n\n273\n00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:23.338\n&gt;&gt; You do not.\n\n274\n00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:24.522\n&gt;&gt; I don't, right?\n\n275\n00:15:24.522 --> 00:15:29.328\nBut if I say put a strange line\nin the middle of the diagram,\n\n276\n00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:34.726\nif I move this to the side suddenly\nI can tell without the numbers,\n\n277\n00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:38.965\nhouse numbers,\nwhat streets these houses are on.\n\n278\n00:15:38.965 --> 00:15:44.827\nI can see that because these\ntwo addresses share the same\n\n279\n00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:50.322\nexact street name,\nthey must be on the same street.\n\n280\n00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:52.520\nUnless there's some\ntrickery going on there.\n\n281\n00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.196\nBut I know that because this address\nhas a different street name,\n\n282\n00:15:57.196 --> 00:15:59.926\nthat they are not on the same network.\n\n283\n00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:01.040\nAnd this is an important thing.\n\n284\n00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.326\nWhen Dan says filtering,\nI really like that analogy.\n\n285\n00:16:04.326 --> 00:16:10.001\nBecause if you look to determine\nwhether an IP address of one computer,\n\n286\n00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:13.700\nversus another computer\non the same network?\n\n287\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.130\nThere's a portion of\nthis that I don't need.\n\n288\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:21.260\nNow if you'll remember, we did the analogy\nthat, if you think about it, the network\n\n289\n00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:27.350\nportion is like your street name, and the\nnode portion is like your house numbers.\n\n290\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.470\nWhat portion do you think I need,\n\n291\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.320\nto identify if these computers\nare on the same network?\n\n292\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.990\nWell, I don't need this portion, right?\n\n293\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.620\nI don't need the node portion right?\n\n294\n00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.740\nI need the network portion,\n\n295\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.900\nthat lets me know that if I have assigned\nan IP address to Dan and my computer.\n\n296\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.500\nOr let's say, I've assigned\nan IP address to my computer,\n\n297\n00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.525\nDan assigns his IP\naddress to his computer.\n\n298\n00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:53.246\nHave we assigned them to the same network?\n\n299\n00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:57.909\nSo when we apply our subnet mask, what is\nhappening to that binary ANDing process?\n\n300\n00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:03.060\nAnd this is the point of what a subnet\nmask does, it is not an IP address.\n\n301\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.152\nWith this ANDing value, we do exactly\nwhat Dan says, and we filter out\n\n302\n00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.972\nthe part that isn't important to figuring\nout if we're on the same network.\n\n303\n00:17:11.972 --> 00:17:14.317\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what they call a mask,\nthat's what they call it a subnet mask.\n\n304\n00:17:14.317 --> 00:17:18.273\nMaybe you wanna spray-paint something,\nyou got one of those stencils?\n\n305\n00:17:18.273 --> 00:17:22.525\nIt's masking of the portion of the wood,\nor whatever you're painting,\n\n306\n00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:25.964\nwith what you don't wanna paint,\nit's masking that off.\n\n307\n00:17:25.964 --> 00:17:30.123\nThat would basically be my subnet,\nmy network, that I'm working on.\n\n308\n00:17:30.123 --> 00:17:33.997\nAnd what I'm painting is\nthe individual name or whatever,\n\n309\n00:17:33.997 --> 00:17:37.570\nthat I'm putting on the side of a sign,\nthat I do want.\n\n310\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.950\nAll right, so,\nthis is why they call it a mask.\n\n311\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.390\nIt's masking off that network ID, so\n\n312\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.430\nthat you can only focus, if you need to,\nwith the individual hosts.\n\n313\n00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.526\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and it works on both\nsides of the river on that one, right?\n\n314\n00:17:50.526 --> 00:17:52.954\nI need to find out the network,\nI need to find out if the,\n\n315\n00:17:52.954 --> 00:17:56.342\ncuz there are times when you have to\nfind out, is that node ID unique, right?\n\n316\n00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:59.450\nBecause we'll have communication issues,\nright?\n\n317\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:04.100\nSo with the ANDing process, again, keep in\nmind, very basically what's going on is,\n\n318\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.920\nthe computer is doing this.\n\n319\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.390\nThe computer says, okay,\nall I see is the binary,\n\n320\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.817\nI couldn't care less what\nthe decimal number is.\n\n321\n00:18:10.817 --> 00:18:14.115\nThat's for us humans, that don't want\nto try to remember 32 bits, right?\n\n322\n00:18:14.115 --> 00:18:16.048\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead, and\n\n323\n00:18:16.048 --> 00:18:21.750\nI'll take the binary, I'll apply that,\nor the subnet mask to the IP address.\n\n324\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.897\nAnd what it's gonna do is,\nit's gonna remove, or like Dan said,\n\n325\n00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:26.820\nmask that portion that I no longer need.\n\n326\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:32.590\nAnd the resulting value is what's known\nas your network ID, your network portion.\n\n327\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:38.181\nNow, if I kind of show you here, and\nI'm certainly not gonna do this 32 times.\n\n328\n00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:42.500\nRemember that value is, that we said,\na 1 and a 1 equals a 1.\n\n329\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.041\nAny other combination,\n\n330\n00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:47.865\na 0 and a 0, a 1 over a 0,\na 0 over a 1, is gonna equal a 0.\n\n331\n00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:52.153\nWell, notice that, if we apply 1's\nall the way down to the, again,\n\n332\n00:18:52.153 --> 00:18:54.980\ncontiguous 1s of your network portion.\n\n333\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.837\nNotice that 1 and a 1 is a 1, I'll do\nthis one time with the first octet.\n\n334\n00:18:57.837 --> 00:19:04.020\n1 and a 1 is a 1, 0 and a 1 is 0,\nall the way down to 0 and a 1 is a 0.\n\n335\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:10.403\nNotice how the first octet here kinda fell\nthrough, it's the same when it's ANDed.\n\n336\n00:19:10.403 --> 00:19:11.987\nThat's why they say falling through,\n\n337\n00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:15.340\nit almost looks like you just put\nit right down there at the bottom.\n\n338\n00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.698\nAnd if you go to the network portion,\n\n339\n00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:22.500\nyou're gonna notice the network\nportion over these 1's stays the same.\n\n340\n00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.953\nBut notice when we get to the portion\nthat we said we mask offed,\n\n341\n00:19:25.953 --> 00:19:29.350\nwe don´t really need,\nthe filter that Dan mentioned?\n\n342\n00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.537\nNotice what´s happening here.\n\n343\n00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:36.832\nBecause I have 0's in that last\noctet of the binary subnet mask,\n\n344\n00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:44.190\nthat means a 0 on any value, or a 1 on\na 1 is a 1, and the other value is a 0.\n\n345\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.443\nSince they're all 0's,\nI'm going to have 0's in that last octet.\n\n346\n00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:51.650\nSo when we kind of zoom out here,\nand we look at this value?\n\n347\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.738\nWhat you're going to end up seeing is,\n\n348\n00:19:54.738 --> 00:19:58.582\nthis not only divides\nthe network from the node.\n\n349\n00:19:58.582 --> 00:20:02.614\nIt actually gets me, now let me\nkind of change this around here, so\n\n350\n00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:04.560\nit's not confusing.\n\n351\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.106\nThis actually gives me what's known\nas not only the network portion,\n\n352\n00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.763\nbut more importantly,\nthe network that we're on.\n\n353\n00:20:10.763 --> 00:20:13.596\nSometimes it's called-\n&gt;&gt; The actual network ID.\n\n354\n00:20:13.596 --> 00:20:16.860\n&gt;&gt; The network ID, absolutely.\n\n355\n00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.665\nNow one of the last things we did in\nthe last episode, well that's redundant.\n\n356\n00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:22.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is we said,\n\n357\n00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:27.380\nhow do you take the binary and\nconvert it back into decimal?\n\n358\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.520\nThis is the reason we went into that.\n\n359\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.550\nBecause now that I see what\nthe computer is doing,\n\n360\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.450\nI gotta read this as a human, right?\n\n361\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.670\nI gotta make this easy for\nWes to understand.\n\n362\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.840\nSo I take this value that\nwe've just achieved here, and\n\n363\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.710\nI turn it back into decimal, right?\n\n364\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.475\nAnd when I turn it back into decimal,\nand again, let me straighten this,\n\n365\n00:20:50.475 --> 00:20:52.743\nbecause I don't want this to be confusing.\n\n366\n00:20:52.743 --> 00:20:58.010\nThis becomes the network ID,\nall right, and that's 192.168.0.0.\n\n367\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.021\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it should be 1.\n\n368\n00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:02.289\n&gt;&gt; Is it supposed to be 1?\n\n369\n00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:04.738\nThat's what you have in the binary.\n\n370\n00:21:04.738 --> 00:21:05.511\n&gt;&gt; Dan, look at you!\n\n371\n00:21:05.511 --> 00:21:09.480\n&gt;&gt; That's why, and this is actually\na really good thing that came up.\n\n372\n00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.500\nBecause what if I'm a network technician,\nor I'm an A+ technician, and\n\n373\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.020\nsomeone's saying, I'm having\ntrouble connecting to my network?\n\n374\n00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.800\nYou take a look at the subnet mask,\nyou take a look at the IP address, and\n\n375\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.810\nthey're not jiving, right?\n\n376\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.400\nBecause that subnet mask is telling\nyou that you have a different network\n\n377\n00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.445\nthan maybe that static IP,\nthat's been placed on that computer.\n\n378\n00:21:26.445 --> 00:21:32.177\nNow,you know, it should be this, so let's\nchange that and see if we get anything.\n\n379\n00:21:32.177 --> 00:21:35.502\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nI wish I could say that I planned that.\n\n380\n00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:36.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's a great catch, and\n\n381\n00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.550\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n382\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:43.054\nNotice that what the network ID is,\nnow, is 192.168.0.0.\n\n383\n00:21:43.054 --> 00:21:47.025\nIt lets me know, that if I was to put\nmy IP address of this right here,\n\n384\n00:21:47.025 --> 00:21:50.603\n0.10 at the end there, so 192.168.0.10.\n\n385\n00:21:50.603 --> 00:21:54.125\nAnd lets say Dan's\ncomputer is 192.168.0.20,\n\n386\n00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:59.560\nthat our computer should be able to talk,\ncuz we're on the same network, all right?\n\n387\n00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.880\nHowever, if you do what Wes did, and\nI come to determine that maybe this is,\n\n388\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.770\nright here, is my IP address.\n\n389\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.468\nBut we notice that Dan's, in the binary,\nwas the little mistake that I did,\n\n390\n00:22:12.468 --> 00:22:14.218\nright, just like Dan said.\n\n391\n00:22:14.218 --> 00:22:17.670\nActually I'd kind of find out that his\nnetwork ID is 192.168.1.0, all right.\n\n392\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.251\nThey're not on the same street,\nthey're not on the same network.\n\n393\n00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Two networks.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, no communication.\n\n394\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.596\nSo I'm actually glad, like you said,\nthat that kind of worked out.\n\n395\n00:22:28.596 --> 00:22:31.430\nUnfortunately, it wasn't actually planned.\n\n396\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.017\n&gt;&gt; It was an unplanned thing.\n\n397\n00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.313\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I swear I signed it that way.\n\n398\n00:22:33.313 --> 00:22:36.910\n&gt;&gt; Some of the best mistakes happen, or\nthe best things happen by accident, right?\n\n399\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.718\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; They call it serendipity.\n\n400\n00:22:37.718 --> 00:22:40.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Dan, let's go ahead, and\n\n401\n00:22:40.644 --> 00:22:42.590\nlet's kinda look at the subnet mask.\n\n402\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.842\nEarlier, we kinda looked at\nthe IP address here, guys.\n\n403\n00:22:44.842 --> 00:22:47.223\nSo I'm going to show you how to\nlog into a computer, apparently-\n\n404\n00:22:47.223 --> 00:22:47.852\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:22:47.852 --> 00:22:48.878\n&gt;&gt; If you guys don't know how to do that.\n\n406\n00:22:48.878 --> 00:22:50.352\n&gt;&gt; If you've never seen this before,\nit'll be fascinating.\n\n407\n00:22:50.352 --> 00:22:52.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so we'll go ahead and\n\n408\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.645\nwe'll log into this machine here, and-\n&gt;&gt; My mind was blown.\n\n409\n00:22:56.645 --> 00:22:58.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n410\n00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:01.610\nthat's some high-tech technology here.\n\n411\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.230\nAnd again, I want to kinda recap this,\nI want you to remember how to get here,\n\n412\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.377\nguys, so I'm gonna close everything down.\n\n413\n00:23:07.377 --> 00:23:08.918\nAnd my head's kinda covering it up here,\n\n414\n00:23:08.918 --> 00:23:10.930\nbut I wanna go back to the same thing,\nright?\n\n415\n00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.480\nSo down in the lower right-hand\nportion of your Windows taskbar,\n\n416\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.438\nwhich we'll get into in\na operating system section here.\n\n417\n00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:22.230\nIf I right-click on that little monitor\nicon with the trident pitchfork on it,\n\n418\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.475\nchoose Open Network and Sharing Center.\n\n419\n00:23:24.475 --> 00:23:26.785\nRemember, we've talked\nabout expansion cards.\n\n420\n00:23:26.785 --> 00:23:30.355\nOur network adapter is responsible for\nthe network communications, and\n\n421\n00:23:30.355 --> 00:23:32.775\nI gotta look at the adapter settings.\n\n422\n00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:38.000\nI pick which network adapter it is,\nI right-click and I choose Status.\n\n423\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.322\nHopefully, some of this other information\nthat we've been kind of talking about\n\n424\n00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:45.144\nbriefly is starting to make sense.\n\n425\n00:23:45.144 --> 00:23:50.443\nNotice that every computer that is going\nto be considered on the same network,\n\n426\n00:23:50.443 --> 00:23:55.421\nkind of going a little farther there\nwith the subnet mask They have to share\n\n427\n00:23:55.421 --> 00:23:56.883\nthe same network ID.\n\n428\n00:23:56.883 --> 00:23:59.330\nThey have to have\na unique node identifier.\n\n429\n00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.970\nCan't have two houses on the same street,\n\n430\n00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.380\ncan't have two computers in the same\nnetwork with the same identifier.\n\n431\n00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.710\nBut the other thing that I didn't\nmention is they also have to\n\n432\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.970\nhave identical Subnet Masks, because\nthe operation that we just shown you.\n\n433\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.110\nSo in this case, and\nwe'll talk about the difference why this\n\n434\n00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:20.030\nisn't the same Subnet Mask there\nthat you just seen in the diagram.\n\n435\n00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.581\nIf I wanted to consider this to\nbe on the same network as Dan,\n\n436\n00:24:23.581 --> 00:24:26.634\nI would have to have the same\nSubnet Mask as he does,\n\n437\n00:24:26.634 --> 00:24:30.130\nbecause our computers use it\nto divide these portions up.\n\n438\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.039\nRight Dan?\n&gt;&gt; Right, the Subnet mask dictates and\n\n439\n00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.640\ndefines what network ID you're on.\n\n440\n00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n441\n00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.710\nI could string these numbers out,\n\n442\n00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.225\nbut if I string these numbers out and\nthey don't have some kind of\n\n443\n00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:46.505\nnot commonality as well as the same\nSubnet mask, we're on different streets.\n\n444\n00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:48.961\nAnd we're gonna need other\ndevices like a mail carrier,\n\n445\n00:24:48.961 --> 00:24:51.015\nto actually communicate\nbetween the streets.\n\n446\n00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:53.746\nNow that's just because I'm lazy and\nI wouldn't walk out the door.\n\n447\n00:24:53.746 --> 00:24:54.334\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And actually deliver it to the next\n\n448\n00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:54.854\nstreet.\nBut\n\n449\n00:24:54.854 --> 00:24:59.457\nthe thought process is\nthe same nonetheless.\n\n450\n00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:03.300\nSo that is a little bit\nabout your IP addresses.\n\n451\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.160\nNow, and what they're doing for us.\n\n452\n00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.062\nNow I know we're kinda running\na little short on time, but\n\n453\n00:25:09.062 --> 00:25:13.442\none of the last things I wanna talk\nabout it this episode is about,\n\n454\n00:25:13.442 --> 00:25:17.602\nessentially a little company or\norganization known as IANA.\n\n455\n00:25:17.602 --> 00:25:19.895\nThe Internet Assigned Number Authority.\n\n456\n00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:23.595\nAgain, in 2003 they kinda dissolved as\n\n457\n00:25:23.595 --> 00:25:27.255\nbeing the Department of Defense's\nauthority over the Internet.\n\n458\n00:25:27.255 --> 00:25:29.445\nToday it's called ICANN,\nthe Internet Corporation for\n\n459\n00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:30.920\nAssigned Names and Numbers.\n\n460\n00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.410\nHowever, when the internet first came\nout when pro net first came out,\n\n461\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.110\nwhat they said is we have\nto use IP addresses right.\n\n462\n00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.760\nThat's how we communicate\na TCBIC based network.\n\n463\n00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.470\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwith these IPB full addresses,\n\n464\n00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.330\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\ndevelop something known as classes.\n\n465\n00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:55.010\nAnd classes are categories or\ngroupings of IP addresses,\n\n466\n00:25:55.010 --> 00:26:00.950\nthat are allocated or assigned if you will\nto computer, based on a couple of thinks.\n\n467\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:06.400\nReally, it's based on how many computers\ndo you need on a single network.\n\n468\n00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.340\nThat's called classful system and\nit is something that\n\n469\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.155\nis where we started,when it came to\ncomputers out there on the Internet.\n\n470\n00:26:15.245 --> 00:26:17.342\nNow, I want you to know the classes,\n\n471\n00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:21.278\nand how you identify them because\nthey could ask you that on the exam.\n\n472\n00:26:21.278 --> 00:26:25.893\nNow, I want you to understand that this\nwas a system that we're used to use.\n\n473\n00:26:25.893 --> 00:26:27.606\nWe've kind of steered away from it,\n\n474\n00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:31.036\nwhich we'll just briefly mention in\nthe end of probably episode five, or\n\n475\n00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:34.770\nsomething like that [LAUGH] part five,\nor however many parts we go into.\n\n476\n00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.742\nBut we want you to know that\nthey're still used as way markers.\n\n477\n00:26:37.742 --> 00:26:39.780\nAnd you have to come to\nunderstand the classes.\n\n478\n00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it became so\n\n479\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.690\na part of our language as IT professionals\nthat was kinda hard to digit to the side,\n\n480\n00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.720\neven though we don't\ntechnically use it any more.\n\n481\n00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.680\nSo you're still gonna see it\nout there in the real world and\n\n482\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.560\npeople talking about it.\n\n483\n00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.799\nSo you have you be able to\nhave that conversation.\n\n484\n00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:55.270\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\nit's heavily referenced.\n\n485\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.529\nSo let's talk about those classes.\n\n486\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.520\nNow when we talk about classes,\nthere are five classes.\n\n487\n00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.406\nAnd in fact if we could bring\nup the little spreadsheet here,\n\n488\n00:27:03.406 --> 00:27:05.566\nwe will talk about each\none of those classes.\n\n489\n00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:10.122\nThey said okay, we're gonna break these up\nand again depending on how many nodes you\n\n490\n00:27:10.122 --> 00:27:13.860\nneed on a network, will really\ndictate which one you'll fall into.\n\n491\n00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.947\nWell, Class A, I want you to know that\n\n492\n00:27:20.947 --> 00:27:25.872\nClass A starts with an IP address of 1.\n\n493\n00:27:25.872 --> 00:27:27.560\n1.0.0.0, all the way to 127.255.255.255.\n\n494\n00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.522\nNow for your reference,\nI don't know how important on the exam.\n\n495\n00:27:31.522 --> 00:27:38.574\nI also went ahead and apparently did not\ndo that binary, yeah I did do the binary.\n\n496\n00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:39.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had to make sure on that one,\n\n497\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.065\nbecause I did mess it up earlier.\n\n498\n00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:44.758\nWent ahead and\nput the binary in here too, just so\n\n499\n00:27:44.758 --> 00:27:48.514\nyou guys can recognize where the class\nstarts and that first octet.\n\n500\n00:27:48.514 --> 00:27:51.655\nNotice that it's 127 to, or 1 to 127.\n\n501\n00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:59.265\nI also want you to know that\nClass B was 128 to 191,\n\n502\n00:27:59.265 --> 00:28:07.726\nor in this case 128.0.0.0\nto 192.255.255.255.\n\n503\n00:28:07.726 --> 00:28:10.675\nReally when it comes down to the exam Dan,\n\n504\n00:28:10.675 --> 00:28:15.580\nthese first octets are really what\nwe kinda look at when we denote it.\n\n505\n00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.717\nSo that'll make it easier for\nyou on the exam.\n\n506\n00:28:17.717 --> 00:28:19.250\nYou don't necessarily\nhave to know the 255's.\n\n507\n00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.523\nBut just for the sake of completeness and\nto be thorough, I went ahead and\n\n508\n00:28:23.523 --> 00:28:25.145\nput exactly what they are.\n\n509\n00:28:25.145 --> 00:28:31.050\nBut you keep in mind that that first\noctet, 1 to 127, that's Class A.\n\n510\n00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.952\nClass B is 128 to 191.\n\n511\n00:28:32.952 --> 00:28:34.262\nClass C is 192 to 223.\n\n512\n00:28:34.262 --> 00:28:37.784\nNow there is a class D and a class E,\n\n513\n00:28:37.784 --> 00:28:42.045\nhowever I want to just say with A,\nB and C.\n\n514\n00:28:42.045 --> 00:28:42.719\nA, B and C,\n\n515\n00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:47.290\nare the ones that are allocated to\ncomputers out there on the Internet.\n\n516\n00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.790\nIt's how we communicate\nacross the Internet.\n\n517\n00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.250\nThere is Class D.\n\n518\n00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.250\nClass D is used by every\ncomputer within networks.\n\n519\n00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.080\nWe're gonna talk about a type of\ncommunication coming up known as\n\n520\n00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.950\nmulticast.\n\n521\n00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:05.180\nMaybe not in this episode, but we'll\ntalk about a concept known as multicast.\n\n522\n00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.020\nThese are multicast addresses.\n\n523\n00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.040\nYour computers use them kind\nof what we call dynamically,\n\n524\n00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.980\nwhich means my computer through a series\nof services and if you will components,\n\n525\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.670\nprocesses, that are running on\nthe computer can assign it to themselves.\n\n526\n00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.790\nThey talk to a certain group of computers,\nand then they don't use it anymore.\n\n527\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.230\nAnd it will go through that process.\n\n528\n00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.180\nSo that's kind of automated\nin the background for us.\n\n529\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.990\nBut I do want you to know for\nthe exam A, B and\n\n530\n00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.530\nC that's a very,\nvery important for the exam.\n\n531\n00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.753\nRemember what I said is that,\n\n532\n00:29:39.753 --> 00:29:45.610\nI told you that if you were going\nto be a major company out there.\n\n533\n00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.690\nDepending on how many computers\nyou need on the Internet,\n\n534\n00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.830\nwould dictate which class you fall into.\n\n535\n00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.850\nWell I want you to notice that there\nis a series of default Subnet Masks.\n\n536\n00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:02.141\nAnd I'll go ahead and mention them\nhere right at the end in this episode,\n\n537\n00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:04.671\nthat applied to these computers.\n\n538\n00:30:04.671 --> 00:30:09.450\nSo if you had a Class A address,\nyour Subnet Mask would be 255.0.0.0.\n\n539\n00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.979\nNow remember what we said,\nnetwork portion versus the node portion.\n\n540\n00:30:15.979 --> 00:30:19.613\nWell notice in the Subnet Mask where the\nzeros are, we've kind of defined through\n\n541\n00:30:19.613 --> 00:30:22.310\nthat ending process that that\nwould be where your nodes are.\n\n542\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.014\nThat gives you 24 bits.\n\n543\n00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:30.230\n24 individual bits for nodes.\n\n544\n00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.908\nRemember everything's a power of two?\n\n545\n00:30:32.908 --> 00:30:38.350\nTwo to the power of 24,\nthat's a mind bogglingly large number.\n\n546\n00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.745\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of numbers.\n\n547\n00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:43.804\n&gt;&gt; I think it's 16,777,216 possibilities,\ntechnically 214, but\n\n548\n00:30:43.804 --> 00:30:46.560\nwe'll learn about that\na little more in network plus.\n\n549\n00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.370\nNotice that Class B.\n\n550\n00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.434\nSo these are very large,\nin fact Apple, Ford Dealership,\n\n551\n00:30:54.434 --> 00:30:59.739\nbig companies had these blocks, IP\naddresses that would fall in this range.\n\n552\n00:30:59.739 --> 00:31:06.530\nClass C, class C has a default\nSubnet Mask of 255.255.0.0.\n\n553\n00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.808\nNow, when we look at that,\nnotice that there are two octets.\n\n554\n00:31:09.808 --> 00:31:14.585\n&gt;&gt; I think you're mistaken you're supposed\nto be in your class B, you're in class C.\n\n555\n00:31:14.585 --> 00:31:16.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm in class C you're confusing\n\n556\n00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:17.097\npeople, Wes.\n\n557\n00:31:17.097 --> 00:31:18.385\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm on the side of the river.\n\n558\n00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:20.131\nI am, how about we get on\nthe right side of the river here.\n\n559\n00:31:20.131 --> 00:31:21.637\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that.\n\n560\n00:31:21.637 --> 00:31:23.787\n&gt;&gt; Let's go to class B there.\n\n561\n00:31:23.787 --> 00:31:28.250\n[LAUGH] If we look at\nthe default Subnet Mask.\n\n562\n00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:33.678\nSo Class B if you will,\nthank you Dan, is 255.255.0.0.\n\n563\n00:31:33.678 --> 00:31:37.470\nNotice that we got one octet, binary one.\n\n564\n00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.030\nSo we go to Class B,\nwe've got two octets of binary ones.\n\n565\n00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:46.665\nThat leaves us 0's, two octet of 0's,\nessentially a 16 bits of 0's,\n\n566\n00:31:46.665 --> 00:31:51.521\nthat's 16 bits for\nyour host to the power of 16 is 65,536\n\n567\n00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:55.960\ntechnically 534 nodes,\nthat can be on a single network.\n\n568\n00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:02.100\nNow, now that I'm in the right side here,\n[LAUGH] we'll go down to Class C here.\n\n569\n00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.972\nClass C has the 255.\n\n570\n00:32:04.972 --> 00:32:06.342\nAnd you can probably see\na pattern going here.\n\n571\n00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:09.760\n255, 255.0.\n\n572\n00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.720\nThis is where they will have kinda small\nbusinesses that only needed a handful of\n\n573\n00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.760\ncomputers, and more specifically 254\ncomputers could be on a single network\n\n574\n00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.570\nbecause we have eight bits if you will,\nthat are reserved for our nodes.\n\n575\n00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.250\nThose are default Subnet Masks.\n\n576\n00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.280\nI also want you to know that, and\nagain thanks for correcting me on that.\n\n577\n00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.229\nKeep in mind A 255.0.0.0.\n\n578\n00:32:31.229 --> 00:32:35.695\nB it increases another octet of ones,\n255.255.0.0.\n\n579\n00:32:35.695 --> 00:32:39.039\nClass C, increases it one more,\nthree octets of ones or\n\n580\n00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:41.730\nif you will 255.255.255.0.\n\n581\n00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:48.137\nAnd again when the Internet\nwas first being developed.\n\n582\n00:32:48.137 --> 00:32:50.584\nThis is where you would go\nto IANA if you will, and\n\n583\n00:32:50.584 --> 00:32:54.665\nif you are a corporation depending on how\nmany computers you needed on a network.\n\n584\n00:32:55.755 --> 00:33:00.678\nEssentially would dictate which one\nof these ranges or these classes,\n\n585\n00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:05.203\nthey would allocate to you to\nconnect to basically the Internet.\n\n586\n00:33:05.203 --> 00:33:09.296\n&gt;&gt; Wes is definitely starting to remove\nthe veil that we might see how these IP\n\n587\n00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:11.540\naddresses are working in our computer,\n\n588\n00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.170\nso that we can connect to our local\nnetworks and even to the Internet itself.\n\n589\n00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.300\nAnd these are the addressing\nschemes that are being used, so\n\n590\n00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.073\nhopefully this is starting\nto make sense for you.\n\n591\n00:33:20.073 --> 00:33:21.559\nI think you're doing a fantastic\njob by the way, Wesley.\n\n592\n00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n593\n00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.530\n&gt;&gt; A very, very clearly explained for\nour viewers out there.\n\n594\n00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.640\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n595\n00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.430\nBut, we got more to go.\n\n596\n00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.930\nSo come back to us for a part three on\nTCP/IP, it's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n597\n00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.791\nAs for this one though signing off for\nITPRO.TV I've been your host,\n\n598\n00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:39.480\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n599\n00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n600\n00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.985\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:48.822\n[MUSIC]\n\n602\n00:33:48.822 --> 00:33:50.926\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:13.285\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:16.990\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.560\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and thanks for\n\n9\n00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.150\njoining us today because we are continuing\non with more in our A plus series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.060\nThat's right the 22901 specifically.\n\n11\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.430\nJoining us yet\nagain to continue our conversation\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.890\non TCPIP networking that is\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.340\nWes glad to have you back yet again, man.\n\n14\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.364\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great man.\n\n15\n00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:38.911\nYeah, we are definitely working\non a little mini series here but\n\n16\n00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:40.790\nthere's a lot of stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.410\nThat when your first\ngetting into computing,\n\n18\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.968\nit can kinda seem a little intimidating.\n\n19\n00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:49.430\nSo, we wanna make sure that we take\nthe time, break it down, make it\n\n20\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.847\nunderstandable, and show you the basics\nwithout scaring you off by all means.\n\n21\n00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:56.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that definitely keep in mind guys\n\n22\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.829\nand gals out there.\n\n23\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.640\nWhen it comes down to your networking and\n\n24\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.160\nsome of these concepts that we're talking\nabout, I know it can seem foreign.\n\n25\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.010\nI know it can seem intimidating.\n\n26\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.740\nWe've both been there, and\nwe've been there with the flashcards,\n\n27\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890\njust sheer memorization.\n\n28\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.630\nUnderstand that as you move on,\nthis will become yesterday's news and\n\n29\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.030\nit will be very basic to you.\n\n30\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.390\nYou guys are intelligent out there,\nyou ladies, I mean, so guys and gals,\n\n31\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.400\nnot forgetting our gals out there.\n\n32\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.230\nYou all are intelligent, you can do this.\n\n33\n00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.220\nJust kinda stay in the game here and\nmake it a hobby.\n\n34\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.330\nAnd that's one of the best pieces of\nadvice I can give you is make it a hobby.\n\n35\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.530\nAnd if it turns out to be one of\nthose things that you go home and\n\n36\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.680\nyou're like wow I need to do some more.\n\n37\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.112\nYou're in the right place, and\n\n38\n00:01:41.112 --> 00:01:44.943\nit's definitely gonna make your career a\nlot easier, especially when you enjoy it.\n\n39\n00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:49.774\nSo, I always say that it's a rare\nday when you really get a chance to\n\n40\n00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.680\nenjoy what you do.\n\n41\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.440\nWe really enjoy what we do.\n\n42\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.195\nWe enjoy networking and sometimes\nit does make us pull our hair out.\n\n43\n00:01:57.195 --> 00:01:59.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, I'm kinda losing mine here, but\n\n44\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.350\nat the same time it really\nis fascinating and fun.\n\n45\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.860\nSo speaking of fascinating and\nfun, let's go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.110\nlet's continue this roller coaster\nride that we are on, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.594\nSo in the first couple of episodes we've\nreally just kinda nailed down what\n\n48\n00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:17.662\nthings like our IPv4 address look like,\nwhat the components are.\n\n49\n00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:21.938\nWe talked pretty extensively about\na subnet mask, binary ending,\n\n50\n00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:24.070\nif you will, conversions.\n\n51\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.780\nOne of the things that I didn't mention in\nthe last part when we were talking about\n\n52\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.640\nthe subnet mask.\n\n53\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.800\nDan and I were talking about\nthis before we started,\n\n54\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.900\nis another concept known as CIDR.\n\n55\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.728\nAll right, and when we say cider,\nwe're not talking about a drink here.\n\n56\n00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not talking about apple cider\n\n57\n00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:37.568\nhere but we'll also.\n\n58\n00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:38.344\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Also tasty.\n\n59\n00:02:38.344 --> 00:02:39.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very tasty, that's right.\n\n60\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.380\nBut we are talking about something known\nas Classless Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n61\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.000\nIt's really all I want you to know\nat this level about what CIDR is.\n\n62\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.970\nBut what they call out more specifically\nis something known as the subnet mask\n\n63\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.130\nversus CIDR.\n\n64\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.570\nAnd really what this\nboil sown to is notation.\n\n65\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.610\nHow do we write these down?\n\n66\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.860\nIn fact, I get a little Spreadsheet here\nand we talked earlier about how a subnet\n\n67\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.045\nmask, if you remember,\nis a series of continuous one bits, right.\n\n68\n00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:11.788\nAnd when it comes to the binary,\nI consider and count out all these ones.\n\n69\n00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:14.200\nNow, I kinda got this\nbroken down into blocks, so\n\n70\n00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.530\nit makes it a little easier visually.\n\n71\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.720\nSo we can see,\nespecially for my four eyes.\n\n72\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.127\nBut remember we have eight bits of ones.\n\n73\n00:03:21.127 --> 00:03:24.110\nEight contiguous one bits.\n\n74\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.091\nAnd we write that out as,\nas you can see, 255.255.255.0.\n\n75\n00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:36.830\nWell if you can just think about how\nmany one bits are in each octet, right.\n\n76\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.814\nYou can also think of it as\nbeing this equals eight, right.\n\n77\n00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:43.245\nAnd then we just kinda repeat the process.\n\n78\n00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:45.289\nThis equals 8, equals 8, and\n\n79\n00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:50.200\nthen obviously not talking down to\nanybody, you guys are intelligent.\n\n80\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.930\nWe have 0, 01 bits.\n\n81\n00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.990\nNow imagine if I could make this a little\n\n82\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.810\nbit easier to denote rather\nthan just saying 255.255.255.0.\n\n83\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.900\nAnd that's what we do when we have\na CIDR notation as it's called.\n\n84\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.480\nThis is decimal dot a decimal notation,\nbut\n\n85\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.860\nyou will see a lot of network engineers,\na lot of networking people will take this.\n\n86\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.516\nFor instance this IP address,\n192,168.10.5, and\n\n87\n00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:18.371\nof the end of it what they'll do is\nthe'll do is something like this,\n\n88\n00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.300\nthey'll do a slash, let's say in\nthis case for this example /24.\n\n89\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.347\nAll right, you might even hear it\nsaid that, Dan would come to me and\n\n90\n00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:28.050\nsay Wes you know what.\n\n91\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.100\nI've got an IP address and\nit's a slash 24 subnet mask.\n\n92\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.010\nWell what's he talking about\nthere when he says that, right?\n\n93\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.565\nWell, what he means by that\nis that's 24 one bits in\n\n94\n00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:40.866\nwhat you would call a subnet mask.\n\n95\n00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.803\nBut rather than take the time to denote,\n255.255.255.0,\n\n96\n00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:48.366\nit would be easier for him to say\nlet me just jot that down for you.\n\n97\n00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:55.880\n192.168.10.24/24 I got an IP address.\n\n98\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.760\nLet me make that /5, wow that turned into-\n&gt;&gt; It really went crazy on you there.\n\n99\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.409\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; Auto correct's really helping Wes out.\n\n100\n00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.513\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n101\n00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:06.573\nAnd in fact, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave that right there, but\n\n102\n00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.820\n192.168.10.5/24.\n\n103\n00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.699\n&gt;&gt; So, you're not saying get\nrid of a subnet mask per se,\n\n104\n00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.560\nwhat you're saying is\nwe're gonna shorthand it.\n\n105\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Dan, that's right.\n\n106\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.800\nBecause they really didn't have\nthe foresight, if you will,\n\n107\n00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.290\nto like the dot com boom.\n\n108\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.800\nThey didn't think that the Internet\nwas gonna become what it did.\n\n109\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.810\nAnd so in the time, it wasn't really\na wasteful system per se if you will,\n\n110\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.050\ncuz there weren't a lot of\npeople on the Internet or\n\n111\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.650\non the ARPANET back in those days.\n\n112\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.110\nSo that's right, and as you can see,\nthese notations that we have here,\n\n113\n00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.980\nI just want you to know for the exam that\nif they give you a slash type of notation,\n\n114\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.170\ncount the bits up, right?\n\n115\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.774\nAnd if you've got a slash 8 that means\nit's a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0,\n\n116\n00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:46.809\neight one bits.\n\n117\n00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.250\nIf it's a slash 16, then what they mean is\n\n118\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.463\n255.255.0.0 right 16 one bits and\nthen slash 24.\n\n119\n00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:58.858\nThat's gonna be like your\nclass c default subnet mask.\n\n120\n00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:04.860\n255.255.255.0 if you will, and just\nlike Dan said it's a shorthand method.\n\n121\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.180\nAnd a lot easier really to denote how\nmany bits are in that subnet mask.\n\n122\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.510\nNow that being said, there's another\nconcept that we really gotta talk about.\n\n123\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.187\nAnd the interesting thing is,\nwe talk about waste, right?\n\n124\n00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:24.735\nAnd because of the prevalence of so\nmany companies connecting to the Internet,\n\n125\n00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:30.420\nthey needed a way basically to stall or\nto kinda slow down this waste.\n\n126\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.390\nAnd one of the things that\nthey came up with was hey,\n\n127\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.460\nwe've got all these classes of\nIP addresses and how about this?\n\n128\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.550\nIn these classes of IP addresses,\nwhat we're gonna go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.450\ndo is we're gonna set aside\na portion of each class that says,\n\n130\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.190\nyou know what,\nyou don't have to come to us.\n\n131\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.440\nYou don't have to come to us,\nI know I can.\n\n132\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.410\nAnd, allocate and we're gonna allocate\na registered IP address to you.\n\n133\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.560\nBut there's a catch, right?\n\n134\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.070\nThere's always a caveat.\nEven though you don't have to come to us\n\n135\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.612\nto get this IP address,\na con of that if you will,\n\n136\n00:07:01.612 --> 00:07:03.844\nis you cannot use it\nover a public network,\n\n137\n00:07:03.844 --> 00:07:07.753\nin this case the only public network\nwe're talking about is the Internet.\n\n138\n00:07:07.753 --> 00:07:13.037\nAnd what we mean by that, is the fact\nthat there are in each class some\n\n139\n00:07:13.037 --> 00:07:18.910\nof these IP addresses that are reserved\nfor internal use only, all right.\n\n140\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.750\nAnd what I mean by internal use is you can\nuse them inside of what's known as your\n\n141\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.230\nlocal area network which we'll talk about,\ngeographical or basically\n\n142\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.060\ndistribution of what network types\nare based on your geographical locations.\n\n143\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.870\n&gt;&gt; This is what they call a none\nroutable IP address, correct?\n\n144\n00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.520\n&gt;&gt; That’s absolutely correct.\n\n145\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.543\nAnd that goes to another concept\nthat we're also gonna talk about, so\n\n146\n00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.788\nremind you to come back to it known as\na gateway, which is important right.\n\n147\n00:07:43.788 --> 00:07:49.051\nIt means I can't send in using this\nrange of IP addresses that are used for\n\n148\n00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:53.988\nonly internal networks,\nI can't send it out across the Internet.\n\n149\n00:07:53.988 --> 00:07:56.537\nI could use it inside my network.\n\n150\n00:07:56.537 --> 00:07:59.456\nIn fact Dan can use the exact\nsame set of IP addresses and\n\n151\n00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:01.420\nthey don't conflict, right?\n\n152\n00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.950\nCuz remember,\nIP addresses have to be unique, right?\n\n153\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.800\nNode portion, network portion,\nacross the public internet or\n\n154\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.630\nwe're gonna have conflicts, all right?\n\n155\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.607\nSo the concept that I wanna talk\nabout it is what's known as, and\n\n156\n00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.495\nthey call it out on the exam, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:19.161\nThey call out public IP addresses and\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n158\n00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:21.698\nSo let's note conceptually,\nI got a little diagram here and\n\n159\n00:08:21.698 --> 00:08:25.000\nlet's kinda understand what we mean\nwhen we say a private IP address.\n\n160\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.625\nWhen we say private IP address,\nwe mean for private internal use, and\n\n161\n00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.704\nwhat I mean by that is you can\nuse this within your networks.\n\n162\n00:08:31.704 --> 00:08:34.635\nAnd if you're connecting to us from home,\nreally work,\n\n163\n00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:39.050\nyou probably are already using these and\nyou don't maybe realize it.\n\n164\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.480\nHowever, public IP addresses are,\nlike Dan said,\n\n165\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.850\nI guess the opposite of what Dan said,\nroutable.\n\n166\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.588\nWhich means we can pass it through a\nconnectivity device along the internet and\n\n167\n00:08:49.588 --> 00:08:54.461\nit can make its way across the backbone\nof the internet to its final destination,\n\n168\n00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:55.008\nright?\n\n169\n00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:57.252\nAnd those are public IP addresses,\nall right?\n\n170\n00:08:57.252 --> 00:09:01.094\nAnd I've got some examples of public\nIP addresses as verse to private IP\n\n171\n00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:02.255\naddresses, right?\n\n172\n00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:06.906\nThese are, in fact, I told you, you might\nstart to recognize that we've used some\n\n173\n00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:10.052\nprivate IP addresses for\nsome of our examples in IPv4.\n\n174\n00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:14.655\n192.168.1, dot, in this case .10, .20,\n\n175\n00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:19.268\n.30, all of these are an example\nof a private IP address.\n\n176\n00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:23.462\nBut what I can't use a private address\nis send it to the device that's going\n\n177\n00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.472\nto connect me across the Internet.\n\n178\n00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:27.051\nThat's the stipulation, right?\n\n179\n00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:28.027\nSo again great,\n\n180\n00:09:28.027 --> 00:09:33.290\nbecause I don't have to go to ICANN to use\ncommunications within my internal network.\n\n181\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.550\nI don't need to come to you and tell you,\n\n182\n00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.960\nyou can't use my internal IP\naddresses because guess what?\n\n183\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.248\nI don't see them.\n\n184\n00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.930\nOnly you're gonna see those\ninside of your networks\n\n185\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:50.210\nverses a public IP address which allows\nus to send traffic across the internet.\n\n186\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.293\n&gt;&gt; Just really quickly,\nlet me just cut in really quickly.\n\n187\n00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.953\nThe IP ranges you've been talking about,\nwe've seen the A, B,and C,\n\n188\n00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:58.524\nyou understand what they are.\n\n189\n00:09:58.524 --> 00:10:02.260\nHow do I know what IP\naddress falls in those range?\n\n190\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.365\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're about to tell you that\nbecause it is something you're gonna need\n\n191\n00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:06.220\nto know for the exam.\n\n192\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.936\nAnd that's a great question\nbecause of the fact that well,\n\n193\n00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:10.578\nthey might throw that on the exams.\n\n194\n00:10:10.578 --> 00:10:14.725\nSo I got a little spreadsheet here, and it\nis important to remember these different,\n\n195\n00:10:14.725 --> 00:10:16.750\nlike we've said, the classes, right?\n\n196\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.866\nThe classes are a range of IP addresses,\nand set aside is,\n\n197\n00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:27.900\nwell, 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.\n\n198\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.028\nSo that is what's known as\nthe private IP address range, right?\n\n199\n00:10:32.028 --> 00:10:36.004\nIt's anything within that range,\nif they ask you on the exam,\n\n200\n00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:39.770\nI want you to know that that's\na Class A private IP address.\n\n201\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.100\nWe can use these on our internal networks.\n\n202\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.970\nNow when it comes to Class B it's,\n\n203\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.080\nthis one was always the one that took\nme a little bit of time to memorize.\n\n204\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.697\nI don't know why, but this is 172.16.0.0,\n\n205\n00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:58.964\nall the way out to 172.31.255.255.\n\n206\n00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:02.639\nLet me see if I get how many octets,\nthere's four octets, so\n\n207\n00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:05.537\n172.31.255.255, all right?\n\n208\n00:11:05.537 --> 00:11:08.716\nAnd you can kinda see our slash notation\nhere that we were talking about.\n\n209\n00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:13.126\nYou know /16, again, is gonna be\ntwo octets of eight bits, right?\n\n210\n00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:15.548\n255.255.0.0.\n\n211\n00:11:15.548 --> 00:11:19.640\nLast one here,\nthis is commonly found really just as\n\n212\n00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.649\na default in your home\nnetworks is Class C, right?\n\n213\n00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:31.015\nAnd that is 192.168.0.0 all\nthe way up to 192.168.255.255.\n\n214\n00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:35.750\nAnd keep in mind, like we've said, range\nof IP addresses, anywhere in between.\n\n215\n00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.680\nNow, the question is,\nwhich one do you have to use?\n\n216\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.000\nAny of them, right?\n\n217\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.200\nBecause they aren't routable like Dan\nmentioned earlier, across the internet.\n\n218\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.500\nThe internet can't see them,\nit doesn't matter how you use them.\n\n219\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.790\nIn fact, you might see that even\nwith your internal company.\n\n220\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.129\nYou could see both, you know,\na series of them being used.\n\n221\n00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:57.811\nNow all the normal IP\naddressing rules apply.\n\n222\n00:11:57.811 --> 00:11:59.610\nComputer's gonna be on the same network,\n\n223\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.950\nit has to have the same network ID, it has\nto have the unique node identifier, right?\n\n224\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.280\nBut what I mean by that is they're\nunregistered, they're unlicensed, right?\n\n225\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.040\nThey are set aside,\nyou use them as you need.\n\n226\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.300\nA lot of times I like to use the 10.,\n\n227\n00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.655\nnot because I need a potential 16\nmillion computers on a single network.\n\n228\n00:12:17.655 --> 00:12:19.105\n10s are really easy to remember, right?\n\n229\n00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.973\n10.10.10.10, right?\n\n230\n00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:22.107\nThat's just easy to type and\n\n231\n00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.340\nreally easy to type when you\ntalk about configuring it.\n\n232\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.840\nSo, when it comes to your IP addresses,\nknow those private ranges.\n\n233\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.360\nKnow the difference between a public\nIP address and a private IP address.\n\n234\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.970\nIt will be important for the exam.\n\n235\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:40.132\nNow, the other thing I wanna talk about\nis basically our next type of IP address,\n\n236\n00:12:40.132 --> 00:12:40.761\nright?\n\n237\n00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:44.903\nWhen we talk about the successor to IPv4,\nall right?\n\n238\n00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:48.403\nThere's a reason we need\na successor to IPv4, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:48.403 --> 00:12:53.072\nWhen the classful system first came out\nthis 32-bit addressing space gave us\n\n240\n00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:55.240\na certain amount of possibilities.\n\n241\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.828\nIt also gave us a lot of waste,\nbut regardless of waste or not,\n\n242\n00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:01.740\nwe only have so much space, all right?\n\n243\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.440\nI want you to think about this,\n\n244\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.600\nin our operating system section we talk\nabout 32-bit versus 64-bit, right?\n\n245\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.560\nWe say 32-bit architecture\nrestricts you to 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n246\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.161\nIs that a number that somebody\njust turned a blind eye to and\n\n247\n00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:18.254\nthrew a dart at a board and said,\nokay, that's what it's gonna be?\n\n248\n00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:21.098\nNo, everything's based on binary.\n\n249\n00:13:21.098 --> 00:13:25.180\nSo 2 to the power of 32 gives you 4.3\nbillion potential memory addresses,\n\n250\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.910\nwhich you look at how bits work\nthat restricts you to about 4 gigs.\n\n251\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.837\nWell it's interesting because IPv4\naddresses are a 32-bit value too, and\n\n252\n00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:35.720\nthe exponentials also work the same.\n\n253\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.342\nThe exponents, right?\n\n254\n00:13:37.342 --> 00:13:43.950\n2 to the power of 32, gives you like,\n2.4, or no, 4.294 billion and change.\n\n255\n00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.290\nWell that is the amount of\naddresses we have out there.\n\n256\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.005\nOur population I think is what,\n7, 8 billion?\n\n257\n00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:52.402\nI'd say it's past 7 billion.\n\n258\n00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:58.301\nThere are over 50 billion IP based devices\nconnected to TCP/IP based networks, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.351\n50 billion.\n\n260\n00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:03.820\n&gt;&gt; Now, I'm no mathematician, but that\nseems like it's more than 4.3 billion.\n\n261\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.425\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n262\n00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:08.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's a very limiting address space.\n\n263\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.141\nSo they came up with a successor, and\nthe successor, if you will, to IPv4,\n\n264\n00:14:12.141 --> 00:14:14.997\nit's been around for\na very long time and it's called IPv6.\n\n265\n00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:16.398\nI don't know what happened to IPv5.\n\n266\n00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.773\nI don't know if it got lost in the wash.\n\n267\n00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:20.184\nIt's probably where all the socks go,\nright?\n\n268\n00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:21.830\nThat black hole out there somewhere.\n\n269\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.120\nBut IPv6 is the successor to IPv4,\nall right?\n\n270\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.110\nAnd it has a lot of efficiencies that\nIPv4 just doesn’t support, right?\n\n271\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.540\nIt does things more efficiently,\nstreamlines,\n\n272\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.610\nmakes it easier on our devices\nto process this information.\n\n273\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.018\nAnd one of the greatest things about it is\nthe pool is astronomically large, I mean,\n\n274\n00:14:40.018 --> 00:14:40.887\nmind boggling,\n\n275\n00:14:40.887 --> 00:14:43.118\nwe don’t even, our minds can’t-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:45.002\n&gt;&gt; Comprehend how many addresses there\n\n277\n00:14:45.002 --> 00:14:45.918\nare, all right?\n\n278\n00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:50.900\nThat's because it is a 128-bit\naddress space, right?\n\n279\n00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:53.490\n4 times the bits, all right?\n\n280\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.660\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk just briefly about an IPv6 address.\n\n281\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.951\nI've got a little diagram here,\nladies and gents, and\n\n282\n00:14:58.951 --> 00:15:00.624\nI want you to remember this for the exam.\n\n283\n00:15:00.624 --> 00:15:02.340\nYou know when we talk about IPv4,\n\n284\n00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.890\nwe talked about dotted decimal notation,\nright?\n\n285\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.402\nAgain, decimal notation separated\nby those periods, if you will.\n\n286\n00:15:08.402 --> 00:15:09.833\nWell, it's kinda interesting,\n\n287\n00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.408\nbecause IPv6 has a little bit\ndifferent of a format, right?\n\n288\n00:15:12.408 --> 00:15:16.380\nIt's what's known as colon hexadecimal,\nright?\n\n289\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.830\nSo hexadecimal is a base 16 number, right?\n\n290\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.677\nWe got 16 possibilities, we got,\nwhat is it, 0 through 9, and\n\n291\n00:15:24.677 --> 00:15:27.453\nthen we've got letters A through F,\nall right?\n\n292\n00:15:27.453 --> 00:15:29.189\nSo we want you to know that, too.\n\n293\n00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:32.893\nYou don't really have to know\nhow to convert, at this point,\n\n294\n00:15:32.893 --> 00:15:36.894\nconvert hexadecimal values into binary,\nbut just know, right?\n\n295\n00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.861\nIt's written in hexadecimal.\n\n296\n00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:42.567\nIf I see any value in an IPv6\naddress as a answer that has\n\n297\n00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:47.412\nanything higher than the letter F,\nit isn't gonna be a valid address.\n\n298\n00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:50.243\n&gt;&gt; Well that's good Wes,\ncuz I'm looking at this address and\n\n299\n00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:52.518\nI'm starting to get\na panic attack happening?\n\n300\n00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.966\n[CROSSTALK] Seems a whole lot\nmore difficult than the IPv4.\n\n301\n00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:59.550\nIt really is, just by the sheer\nvolume of it, the sheer size of it.\n\n302\n00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.040\nWe're talking 128 bits\nunder the hood here, right?\n\n303\n00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.310\nComputers, I also want you to understand,\ncan have multiple IPv6 addresses.\n\n304\n00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.820\nAnd as you'll go on, you'll learn in\nadditional training, that's something that\n\n305\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.800\nyou really have to worry about here is\nthat again, it's more efficient and it can\n\n306\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.340\nuse different types of IPv6 addresses for\ndifferent types of communication.\n\n307\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.970\nNow, just as intimidating\nas this address does look,\n\n308\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.970\nabsolutely realized that, ladies and\ngents, it can be abbreviated.\n\n309\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.780\nSo we wanna talk briefly here about the\nabbreviation techniques that you can use.\n\n310\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:38.720\nYes, we're talking about eight individual\nblocks of hexadecimal values, right?\n\n311\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.690\nHowever, if you look at a non-abbreviated,\nthis is the non-abbreviated address.\n\n312\n00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.892\nI hope to God that's not\nan abbreviated address.\n\n313\n00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:47.436\n[LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:16:47.436 --> 00:16:52.110\nJust like Dan said, the one that's giving\nhim heart palpitations over there.\n\n315\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.990\nBut one of the things I want\nyou to pay attention to is,\n\n316\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.230\nnotice that we have leading 0s.\n\n317\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:01.270\nAnd what I mean by that is we have a few\n0s here in front of the 54, 0054, right?\n\n318\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:08.250\nWe have three 0s in this block of four 0s,\nleading 0s.\n\n319\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.570\nWell, you can actually remove\nthose leading zeroes and\n\n320\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.280\nby comparison right here, see, notice that\nwe have removed the leading zeroes here.\n\n321\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.810\nNotice in each one of these blocks,\n\n322\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.410\nnotice that the 0054 gets\nabbreviated to 54 in this case.\n\n323\n00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.230\nWe have a 08DE,\nthat 0 gets removed as well, right?\n\n324\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.590\nSo that's the same exact address,\n\n325\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:33.140\nmakes it a little bit easier to write\ndown, as far as when we talk about IPv6.\n\n326\n00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.780\nBut one of the further abbreviation\ntechniques which is kinda interesting\n\n327\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.110\nis these contiguous blocks of zeros,\nthey can be abbreviated even farther.\n\n328\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.960\nWhat we can do is we can\nremove those continuous 0s and\n\n329\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.630\nwe can replace it with a double colon.\n\n330\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.440\nHowever, this is something to keep in mind\nfor the exam so that you will recognize\n\n331\n00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.560\na valid abbreviation versus\nan invalid abbreviation.\n\n332\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.640\nThat double colon can only appear in one\nposition in the entire IPv6 address, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.930\nCuz in earlier episodes it's\nnot the same concept but\n\n334\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.740\nI want you to remember we said that\nthe subnet mask the computer uses ,it's\n\n335\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.560\nnot just a random number\nthat they made up.\n\n336\n00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.900\nIt actually applies a operation to the IP\naddress to split the node from the host.\n\n337\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.360\nWell, believe it or not, the computer\nuses that double colon as well.\n\n338\n00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.890\nI mean, it applies an operation and\n\n339\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:34.010\nit says, okay, let me look at how many\nblocks I have in this IPv6 address.\n\n340\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.270\nIt knows that there needs\nto be eight blocks there.\n\n341\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.970\nSo when it comes to a double\ncolon within the address,\n\n342\n00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.040\nif we count along here, we'll see one,\ntwo, three, four, five blocks.\n\n343\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.860\nWell it knows that,\nthat's an abbreviated IPv6 address,\n\n344\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.360\nthere's five blocks that I see.\n\n345\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.200\nIt means there must be three blocks that\nhave been just completely removed and\n\n346\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.350\nreplaced with the double colon,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n347\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.650\nI might give you like, for instance one\nmore example, cuz this might throw you off\n\n348\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.360\nand I want you guys to keep in mind\nthat something like this where we say.\n\n349\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.900\nLet's say for\ninstance we had 220, or yeah,\n\n350\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.270\n2202, I don't know why the at symbol\nthat I'm trying to put in there,\n\n351\n00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.130\nthat's not a valid IPv6 address,\nvery easy to tell.\n\n352\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.110\nBut I could do something like\nthis where I went like this.\n\n353\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.610\nAll right, understand now,\nit's not an example of this one here, but\n\n354\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.830\nthis is a valid IPv6 address, right?\n\n355\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.680\nBecause the double colon is just saying,\nokay I see two blocks,\n\n356\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.640\nthere has to be five continuous blocks of\n0s here, essentially that I've give- SIx.\n\n357\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.410\nSix continuous blocks of 0s that\nhave been truncated down or\n\n358\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.790\nabbreviated if you will, excuse me.\n\n359\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.190\nKeep in mind that that\nis a valid IPv6 address.\n\n360\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.150\nOne of the last things I\nwanna say is when we say\n\n361\n00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.585\nthat the pool of addresses is so large.\n\n362\n00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:59.041\nWe said 4.3 billion right,\nit just makes it easier,\n\n363\n00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:02.245\nagain it's 4.294 billion and change.\n\n364\n00:20:02.245 --> 00:20:06.765\nSome of the analogies that I've\nheard in the past, from people that\n\n365\n00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:10.055\nare well more brilliant with networking\nthan I am like network engineers.\n\n366\n00:20:10.055 --> 00:20:14.055\nOne said, if you were to take\nan IPv4 address space and\n\n367\n00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:17.210\nconvert each one of the possibilities\ninto a grain of sand.\n\n368\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.660\nThat you would need a container that is\nreally the size of a very small moving\n\n369\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.080\ntruck to contain all that sand, and\nyou'd have a lot of space left over.\n\n370\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.860\nIf you were to take this same analogy and\napply it to the IPv6 address,\n\n371\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.010\nspace 2 to the power of 128,\nthen you would need a container that\n\n372\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.100\nis 1.3 billion times the circumference\nof our earth to contain all the sand.\n\n373\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.440\nAgain, the number is so mindbogglingly\nlarge that I don't want to say never,\n\n374\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.470\nbut it's gonna be a very long time before\nwe ever see something like IPv7 or IPv8.\n\n375\n00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.730\nYeah cuz, well,\nhopefully there will never be a need for\n\n376\n00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.650\nit, that's a lot of numbers ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n377\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.220\nAnd what's funny is we haven't\neven gotten to how the heck do we\n\n378\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.720\nget these numbers and\nI'm looking at our clock there and\n\n379\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.400\nI think we might be out of time for\nthat explanation Wesley.\n\n380\n00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.010\nYeah, most definitely we're definitely\ngoing to have to go into another part of\n\n381\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.925\nthem because like Dan said, we haven't\ntalked about acquiring an IPv4 or\n\n382\n00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:10.985\nIPv6 address.\n\n383\n00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:12.855\nBut I think we are going\nto have to save that for\n\n384\n00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:14.725\na later time because I've\ngot a lot more to say.\n\n385\n00:21:14.725 --> 00:21:15.485\nThat's right.\n\n386\n00:21:15.485 --> 00:21:16.395\nI look forward to it.\n\n387\n00:21:16.395 --> 00:21:18.055\nWes, it's been a fun conversation so far.\n\n388\n00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:21.725\nHopefully, you good folks out there\nare learning a lot about networking and\n\n389\n00:21:21.725 --> 00:21:25.705\nhow these IP schemes and addresses\nare working out inside your computers so\n\n390\n00:21:25.705 --> 00:21:27.385\nwe can have network communications.\n\n391\n00:21:27.385 --> 00:21:30.630\nSo join us back for,\nwhat is this part four gonna be coming up?\n\n392\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.970\nSo, it's gonna be a lot of fun,\nbe there or be square.\n\n393\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.080\nAs for this episode,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n394\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.610\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n395\n00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.320\nAnd I'm We Bryan.\n\n396\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.043\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n397\n00:21:40.043 --> 00:21:46.836\n[MUSIC]\n\n398\n00:21:46.836

00:00:05.977\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:08.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.107\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:13.393\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.481\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:18.222\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:21.490\nin today's episode we are going\nforward with more in our A+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.550\nAnd of course,\njoining us back in the studio,\n\n11\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.040\nwe're still working on\nnetworking TCP/IP specifically.\n\n12\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.660\nOur good friend, Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.820\nWes Bryan, has continued to return and\nteach us more on these things.\n\n14\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.564\nWes, welcome back, sir,\nhow is it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:36.582\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nwe might be in this until,\n\n16\n00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:39.411\nI don't know, IPv7 or\nthe new protocol stack.\n\n17\n00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I remember back in those days.\n\n18\n00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:44.233\n&gt;&gt; We only had 40 bazillion IP addresses.\n\n19\n00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:46.057\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n20\n00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:48.934\nand as you guys can see, some of\nthe topics that we've been talking about,\n\n21\n00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.050\nespecially when you first\ndive into them are complex.\n\n22\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.490\nI remember when we got into things\nlike binary and IP addresses.\n\n23\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.640\nMy skin was crawling.\n\n24\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.780\nI was like, my God,\nwhat did I get myself into?\n\n25\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.770\nBut as you can see, hopefully you watched\nthe videos, the three that we've had\n\n26\n00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.270\nbefore this, and definitely pause them and\ngo back over them, if you will.\n\n27\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.100\nRemember that you can do this.\n\n28\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280\nThere's a lot of different components and\n\n29\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850\nvery important components when it\ncomes to even basic networking.\n\n30\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.628\nAnd why we've been spending so\nmuch time, like Dan said,\n\n31\n00:01:19.628 --> 00:01:21.690\nthrough the past few episodes and myself.\n\n32\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.830\nNetworking really is\ngoing to be a staple in\n\n33\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.507\nyour career even if you're just talking\nabout being a basic IT tech, right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:33.460\nI'll just recap what I said\nin an earlier episode,\n\n35\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.410\nthat my instructor said that if\nyou're gonna be into computing and\n\n36\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.220\nyou don't really know\nanything about networking,\n\n37\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.090\nthen a lot of times all you're going\nto do is deliver the computer in a box.\n\n38\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.740\nAnd you might not even set it up.\n\n39\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.910\nCuz even at the basic level, you'll have\nto know how to make the connections to\n\n40\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.380\nthe network in order to give somebody\nsome kind of good computing experience.\n\n41\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.610\nSo moving on, we wanna talk, Dan,\nwe talked a lot about IP addresses.\n\n42\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.230\nWe've talked about the characteristics\nof the IP address, the components.\n\n43\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.982\nBut one of the things that we\nhaven't really talked about is well,\n\n44\n00:02:05.982 --> 00:02:08.331\nhow do we get these IP addresses, right?\n\n45\n00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:13.239\nAnd there are a few different methods\nin which we can obtain an IP address.\n\n46\n00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.908\nIn fact, I'll tell you what.\n\n47\n00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:18.370\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll dive right into our diagram here.\n\n48\n00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.529\nAnd we'll talk a little about\nsome of the concepts here.\n\n49\n00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:25.230\nOn the exam, they call out two\nof the main methods when it\n\n50\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.140\ncomes to obtaining an IP address.\n\n51\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.480\nNow we have what's known\nas dynamic addressing and\n\n52\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.920\nwe have what's known as static addressing.\n\n53\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.163\nI'm gonna add something to static\naddressing because I think\n\n54\n00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:37.104\nit helps people.\n\n55\n00:02:37.104 --> 00:02:39.975\nIf it's the first time they see it,\nyou think static, right?\n\n56\n00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:41.525\nWell, what does static mean?\n\n57\n00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:45.149\nI also want you to consider\nit as manual addressing.\n\n58\n00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.600\nOkay, so in your mind, even though it's\ntechnically called static addressing,\n\n59\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.975\nI want you to think of manual addressing\nevery time I say that word static, okay?\n\n60\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.010\nNow we have what is known\nas dynamic addressing.\n\n61\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.810\nLet's go ahead and\n\n62\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.010\nlet's start there, and let's talk about\nwhy we might want dynamic addressing.\n\n63\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.630\nWell, in a home environment a lot\nof times what you'll have is\n\n64\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.680\nyou'll have maybe a stationary desktop,\none that doesn't really move a lot.\n\n65\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.438\nAnd you might have a lot of,\nyou might have laptops, right?\n\n66\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.910\nYou might have other devices\nwithin your networks.\n\n67\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.250\nToday we have the Internet of Things.\n\n68\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.965\nWe've got Rokus, we got streaming players,\nwe got Smart TVs.\n\n69\n00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:25.045\nWe've got mobile phones coming in and\noff of your network.\n\n70\n00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:28.880\nAnd we're really not talking about\nconnections to the cellular network.\n\n71\n00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.750\nWe're talking about literally\nconnecting to your wireless networks.\n\n72\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.760\nAnd here's something to understand.\n\n73\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.350\nWhen you talk about dynamic addressing,\nyou're talking about a service that allows\n\n74\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.220\nyour devices when they\nconnect to your networks,\n\n75\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.510\nand again, not just home networks,\nwe're talking in corporate networks, too.\n\n76\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.400\nTo obtain the IP address by basically\ncommunicating with the network\n\n77\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.420\nover a series of services\nand/or protocols.\n\n78\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.184\nAnd what they can do, the devices,\nwhen they connect to your network,\n\n79\n00:03:59.184 --> 00:04:02.760\nthey can essentially call out and\nsay, hey, out there somewhere,\n\n80\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.267\nsomewhere on this network,\n\n81\n00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:08.378\nis there a device that can hand me\na certain amount of configuration, right?\n\n82\n00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:12.088\nNow, when we talk about configuration, I\nwant you to understand it's not just about\n\n83\n00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:15.540\nyour IP address because, like we've\ntalked about in the first few parts here,\n\n84\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.245\nremember we said an IP address\nisn't the only thing you need.\n\n85\n00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:19.765\nYou also need a subnet mask, right?\n\n86\n00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:22.707\nThe subnet mask is what defines\nwhat network you're on.\n\n87\n00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:26.420\nThe other thing you need is what's\nknown as a default gateway.\n\n88\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.490\nAnd in fact, let's go ahead.\n\n89\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.530\nI'm gonna switch over to my Windows\nmachine, guys and gals out there, and\n\n90\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.610\nlet me kind of show you what I mean.\n\n91\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.245\nAll right, now we're in our Network and\nSharing center inside of Windows.\n\n92\n00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:39.865\nAnd if you can remember,\nlet's go ahead and recap how to get there.\n\n93\n00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:43.045\nNow my head's always kind of covering\nthis one up because of the task bar on\n\n94\n00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:44.525\nthe lower right-hand side.\n\n95\n00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:46.050\nWe have this notification area.\n\n96\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.185\nAnd remember we just right-click\non our network icon.\n\n97\n00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:52.795\nAnd we can choose Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n98\n00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:57.425\nThen we can go to our change adapter\nsettings, and in change adapter settings,\n\n99\n00:04:57.425 --> 00:04:59.440\nyou will see we have a path here.\n\n100\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.950\nControl Panel is another way that you can\ngo, and we'll look at that more in our\n\n101\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.740\noperating system episodes and\nget you a little more familiar with that.\n\n102\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.410\nNetwork Internet &gt; Network Connections,\nand\n\n103\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.530\ninside of this we have\nour network adapters.\n\n104\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.437\nAnd remember, if we just right-click on\nour network adapter and we choose status,\n\n105\n00:05:14.437 --> 00:05:17.643\nthen what we have are well,\nsome of the connection details, right?\n\n106\n00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:19.860\nAnd we can see some very\nbasic information here.\n\n107\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.190\nWe can see that we have IPv4 connectivity,\nso\n\n108\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.090\nremember that tells me right away I've\ngot an IP address, I have a subnet mask.\n\n109\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.730\nBut I also wanna just briefly\nmention another component here, and\n\n110\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.520\nthat is something known\nas your default gateway.\n\n111\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.950\nYour default gateway is essentially\nwhat allows you to connect in context\n\n112\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.960\nout to the Internet.\n\n113\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.350\nNow you'll go on to Network+ and\n\n114\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.510\nlearn that your default gateway allows\nyou to connect to another remote network.\n\n115\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.000\nThink of it as the doorway\nout of your house, right?\n\n116\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.060\nIf I just brick off\nthe door into the house,\n\n117\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.080\nyou're gonna stay within the inside of\nyour house, and you're not gonna get out.\n\n118\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.044\nWe're not talking about\njumping out the window, right?\n\n119\n00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:56.649\n[LAUGH] So imagine your default gateway is\nthe way that I can send information off of\n\n120\n00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:58.716\nmy home network and\nget it out to the Internet or\n\n121\n00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:01.658\noff of a corporate network and\nget that out of the Internet, too.\n\n122\n00:06:01.658 --> 00:06:03.994\nBut notice there's a lot\nof information here, right?\n\n123\n00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:08.145\nThere's a lot of configurations that are\ngoing on and that's one of the things that\n\n124\n00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:11.064\nthe service that we're gonna\ntalk about allows you to do.\n\n125\n00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:14.937\nIt allows me to connect to a network,\ncall out to the network and say, hey,\n\n126\n00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:16.300\nI need this information.\n\n127\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.140\nI need this configuration.\n\n128\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.390\nNow why would this service be beneficial?\n\n129\n00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.485\nWell, there's a couple of reasons that we\nkind of wanna keep in mind, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:27.953\nWhen you have multiple devices,\na multitude of devices that are maybe\n\n131\n00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:32.186\njoining your network or maybe leaving your\nnetwork, and I quite literally mean maybe\n\n132\n00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:35.509\nyou got a tablet and a laptop and\nyou take it into your home network.\n\n133\n00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.457\nAnd then you turn around and\nyou take it to work,\n\n134\n00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:40.149\nmaybe you take it on vacation with you,\nmaybe you travel with it.\n\n135\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.030\nWhat you want is the ability to allow\nthat device, to configure that device to\n\n136\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.510\nuse that service to say, hey, just give\nme that configuration information and\n\n137\n00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.280\nI'll go ahead and take that\ninformation and configure it for you.\n\n138\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.940\nThat's essentially what dynamic means,\nright?\n\n139\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.700\nDynamic means let's let\nthe service do it for us and\n\n140\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.050\nwe don't have to sit there and enter\nall of this information that we've seen\n\n141\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.740\nin the TCP/IP properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n142\n00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.062\nIt's easier to configure.\n\n143\n00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:08.520\nIt's also a little easier to reconfigure,\ntoo, and\n\n144\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.430\nwe'll talk about that here in a second.\n\n145\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.145\nIt also gives you a consistent\nconfiguration here because you guys and\n\n146\n00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:16.520\ngals out there have seen\nmy typing abilities.\n\n147\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.340\nYou can see that sometimes I can't even\ntype an IP address to save my life.\n\n148\n00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.061\nAnd that's where dynamic addressing\ndoes come in handy, right?\n\n149\n00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:26.822\nI could tell the service,\nthis is a series,\n\n150\n00:07:26.822 --> 00:07:31.301\nthis is a bank or a pool of IP addresses\nthat I want you to hand every device\n\n151\n00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:34.240\nthat calls out to the network and\nasks for one.\n\n152\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.350\nAnd then I walk away from it, and\nI don't have to do anything after that.\n\n153\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.060\nSo I get a good consistency in all\nof the configuration information.\n\n154\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.170\nNow we'll talk about the service and\n\n155\n00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.680\nthe protocol down here in a bit that's\nproviding that dynamic addressing.\n\n156\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.970\nNow here's another thing.\n\n157\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.386\nWe have static addressing.\n\n158\n00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:54.640\nAll right, now static or,\nagain, manual addressing.\n\n159\n00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.150\nAll right, well,\nthis is where I'm gonna go in.\n\n160\n00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.277\nIn fact,\nI Kinda switch over to our machine here.\n\n161\n00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:03.360\nThis is where I'm gonna go into\nthe properties of the network adapter.\n\n162\n00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.200\nAnd we're still in the same location,\nbut instead of choosing Details here,\n\n163\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.480\nwe go down to Properties.\n\n164\n00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.580\nNow, I'm in a Windows specific device, so\n\n165\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.958\nI want you to know that every\nmachine is gonna require these.\n\n166\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.536\nIf you wanna talk to the network,\nyou need an IP address,\n\n167\n00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:18.490\nwhether it's dynamic or static, right.\n\n168\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.940\nDoesn't matter if you're in Windows,\nit's nothing specific to Windows.\n\n169\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.810\nDoesn't matter if you're on Unix system,\nif you're on a Linux system, Mac system.\n\n170\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.160\nIf you're talking about a smart TV,\n\n171\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.260\na cell phone that connects\nto your network or tablet.\n\n172\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.020\nIf you wanna communicate on the network,\n\n173\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.630\nyou need one of these\ntwo addressing types.\n\n174\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.770\nAnd this way, what I have to do is I\nhave to go with static addressing, and\n\n175\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.660\nI have to configure this information.\n\n176\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.960\nWhich means, I also have to\nremember what the configuration is.\n\n177\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.500\nNotice that we have\nthe properties of TCP/IP here.\n\n178\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.033\nNow, they spell it out fully, right?\n\n179\n00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:49.577\nInternet Protocol Version 4.\n\n180\n00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:54.690\nBut if we go ahead and we select that,\nwe can choose Properties.\n\n181\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.900\nNotice that we've got a couple of options.\n\n182\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.770\nAll right,\nnow obtain an IP address automatically.\n\n183\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.450\nLet's be careful with\nthat term automatically,\n\n184\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.110\nbecause we're gonna talk about another\nconcept that's a little bit more automatic\n\n185\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.680\nthan this, right?\n\n186\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.542\nI still have to choose this option, right?\n\n187\n00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:09.580\nSo it's dynamic, and\nI wanna be careful with that one.\n\n188\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.524\nBut, if I wanna do a static assignment,\nI have to manually enter it.\n\n189\n00:09:14.524 --> 00:09:20.280\nSo I'd have to do something like we've\nbeen seeing, where I do a 192.168.1.10.\n\n190\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.746\nI'd have to know what my subnet mask is,\nand\n\n191\n00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:27.597\nWindows by default does\na classful subnet mask.\n\n192\n00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:31.300\nSo, you have to know,\nis it a class for subnet mask or not?\n\n193\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.390\nAnd then we'll talk about DNS in\nhere in a second coming up, right?\n\n194\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.810\nBut I would also have to enter\ninformation like this as well,\n\n195\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.640\nto do the configuration, right?\n\n196\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.800\nNow, notice that that is a very,\nvery manual process, right?\n\n197\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.000\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this out,\n\n198\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.180\ncuz I don't wanna lose my\nnetwork connectivity right now.\n\n199\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.900\nBut that's one of the things\nabout static assignment, right?\n\n200\n00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.492\nIt's a manual process, and\ngiven my typing abilities,\n\n201\n00:09:54.492 --> 00:09:58.170\nit is prone to things like configuration\nerrors, if you have to do too much of it.\n\n202\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.691\n&gt;&gt; It's a little suspect there Wes, I\nknow you're not the best typist on earth.\n\n203\n00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:03.068\nBut, and it is one of\nthe problems that come into play,\n\n204\n00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:05.047\nwhen you're using a manual configuration.\n\n205\n00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:07.940\nIt doesn't mean we don't use\nmanual configurations, we do.\n\n206\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.500\nActually, we use it quite a bit.\n\n207\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.690\nWe just don't use it as much\nas the dynamic servers,\n\n208\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.330\nbecause that dynamic server\noffers that ease of use.\n\n209\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.860\nNow Wes, I can hear the questions\ncoming through the screen, asking,\n\n210\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.710\nwhere do you get all that information?\n\n211\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:27.057\nHow do you know to set the IP\naddress to 192.168.1.110,\n\n212\n00:10:27.057 --> 00:10:29.700\nand the DNS server to 8.8.8.\n\n213\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.182\nWhere does that information come from,\nif you're setting it up static?\n\n214\n00:10:32.182 --> 00:10:34.396\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're gonna set\nit up staticly, first of all,\n\n215\n00:10:34.396 --> 00:10:36.446\nyou have to know what\nservers you're using, right?\n\n216\n00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:39.868\nThink of a server as a, it's nothing\nmore than a computer out there,\n\n217\n00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:41.529\nit's got its Operating System.\n\n218\n00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:44.880\nBut it's highly optimized\nto perform a service right?\n\n219\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.920\nServing you a service, hence the name\nserver right, that's convenient right?\n\n220\n00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.200\nSo you have to know what device\nis giving you that service.\n\n221\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.390\nIf you're gonna do a manual configuration,\nyou have to know the IP address of\n\n222\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.730\nthe device that's gonna\nprovide you that service.\n\n223\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.180\nThe other thing too,\nwe're gonna talk about DNS servers, and\n\n224\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.450\nhelping us with some names,\nname resolution out there in a bit.\n\n225\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.760\nI would have to know where\nthe DNS server is, right?\n\n226\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.894\nSo, I'd have to find out whatever that IP\naddress, is and I'd have to assign it.\n\n227\n00:11:11.894 --> 00:11:15.839\nNow I will tell you, in things like home\nenvironments, a lot of times what we do,\n\n228\n00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:18.460\nNan, is our gateway device\nis typically our router.\n\n229\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.150\nWe'll put the IP address of the router\ninside of things like the default gateway.\n\n230\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.320\nBecause we're gonna send that\ninformation to the gateway,\n\n231\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.580\nagain, that leads us off of our network.\n\n232\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.080\nAnd you could even do that, if you will,\nin home environments, to the DNS server.\n\n233\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.060\nBecause what you're saying is,\n\n234\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.950\nyou know what, access point, I don't know\nwhat the IP address is of a DNS server.\n\n235\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.700\nI'll just pass that information to you.\n\n236\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.910\nAnd then what happens is\nyour access point, or\n\n237\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.250\nyour device actually works\nlike a pass through.\n\n238\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.295\nAnd a lot of times it just passes that\nname resolution request right off to\n\n239\n00:11:49.295 --> 00:11:49.903\nyour ISP.\n\n240\n00:11:49.903 --> 00:11:53.329\nAll right, now in a corporate environment,\nto be a little bit more specific on that,\n\n241\n00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:55.480\nyou would have to know all\nthat information, right?\n\n242\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.810\nYou would have to know those servers.\n\n243\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.850\nNow, if i do this in a dynamic sense,\na lot of times,\n\n244\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.110\nall I need to do is just set that\nsetting that you've just seen.\n\n245\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.482\nFor instance, if we can take a look\nat my screen here just a second,\n\n246\n00:12:09.482 --> 00:12:12.328\nI don't have to know a lot\nof that information, right?\n\n247\n00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:15.877\nAgain, right clicking,\nchoosing Properties, as you guys can see,\n\n248\n00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:19.860\nwe'll talk about this more in the software\nepisodes, the Operating System.\n\n249\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.780\nYou have to be an administrator\nto be able to do this.\n\n250\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.310\nThis isn't something that\na standard user can do,\n\n251\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.540\ncuz you can potentially hurt\nyour computer, all right.\n\n252\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.370\nIf I choose, again, the IP properties\nof the network adapter, right.\n\n253\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.970\nNotice, I don't have to know\nany information, right?\n\n254\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.040\nI just obtain it automatically.\n\n255\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.720\nAnd that's the beauty of the service,\nall right?\n\n256\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.550\nThe service says, you call out to me, I'm\nthe device that's providing that service.\n\n257\n00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.340\nAgain, think of a server.\n\n258\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.430\nI'll go ahead, I'll give you that\nconfiguration information for you.\n\n259\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.670\nNow, Dan, you mentioned a good point.\n\n260\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.940\nYou said, well static assignments,\ndo we not use them?\n\n261\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.460\nDo we shy away from them?\n\n262\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.580\nThe answer's no.\n\n263\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.030\nThere are devices on your network that you\ndon't want to have a static IP address.\n\n264\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.520\nNow let me tell you why.\n\n265\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.510\nAll right-\n&gt;&gt; You mean a dynamic IP address.\n\n266\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.357\n&gt;&gt; What you, that's, thank you,\nthank you, thank you.\n\n267\n00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:09.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's get on the right side\n\n268\n00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.190\nof the tracks here.\n\n269\n00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.492\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to\nconfuse anyone [LAUGH].\n\n270\n00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:12.487\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n271\n00:13:12.487 --> 00:13:16.544\nyou do want to have certain devices\nthat have dynamic IP addresses.\n\n272\n00:13:16.544 --> 00:13:20.650\nAnd you do have a series of devices\nthat you want to have static addresses.\n\n273\n00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.670\nWhy?\n\n274\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.437\nThe difference is, with dynamic and\nstatic, a dynamic address can change.\n\n275\n00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:28.785\nAnd what that means is,\nwe usually have a listing in the device,\n\n276\n00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:30.774\nit holds a little bit of information.\n\n277\n00:13:30.774 --> 00:13:33.494\nThink of it really as a file,\nit's got like a phone book,\n\n278\n00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:35.093\na bunch listing of IP addresses.\n\n279\n00:13:35.093 --> 00:13:38.986\nBut the thing is, let's say you take your\nlaptop, and you bring it to work, and\n\n280\n00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:40.574\nyou forget it for a week, or so.\n\n281\n00:13:40.574 --> 00:13:43.861\nAll right, then you bring it back to your\nhome, you're like, yeah, I remember,\n\n282\n00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:46.157\nI left it in the break room and\nI forgot it for a week, right?\n\n283\n00:13:46.157 --> 00:13:50.401\nBut then you bring it back to your home,\nand it calls out to the network and\n\n284\n00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:52.790\nit says, I need an IP address.\n\n285\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.680\nWell in that week, that list, there\ncould've been an IP address that it was\n\n286\n00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.140\nusing that was handed to another\ndevice that connected to your network.\n\n287\n00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.130\nThat's why they call it dynamic,\ncuz it can change.\n\n288\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.440\nAnd that's really the dynamic part of it.\n\n289\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.520\nNow you have devices on your network\nthat other devices have to connect to.\n\n290\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.490\nThey have to know where\nit is at all times.\n\n291\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.661\nThat means-\n&gt;&gt; Plymouth Rock, right?\n\n292\n00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:13.058\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\n\n293\n00:14:13.058 --> 00:14:14.323\nthe sword in the stone, if you will.\n\n294\n00:14:14.323 --> 00:14:15.279\nDon't move, and\n\n295\n00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:19.770\nthat's because, they might be expecting\nto connect to a certain location.\n\n296\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.660\nLet me give you an example.\n\n297\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.854\nYou might have a media server.\n\n298\n00:14:21.854 --> 00:14:24.482\nAnd I know there are a lot\nof technologies out there,\n\n299\n00:14:24.482 --> 00:14:26.708\nwhere they don't need a static IP address.\n\n300\n00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:29.970\nThey can call out and they can\ndiscover it automatically for you.\n\n301\n00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.150\nBut a lot of devices,\nespecially like servers, right.\n\n302\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.610\nServers typically,\nyou don't want the IP address changing,\n\n303\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.055\ncuz I want you to think of it\nis like your mailbox, right?\n\n304\n00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:40.264\nEveryday, if you're getting snail mail,\n\n305\n00:14:40.264 --> 00:14:44.218\nyour mail carrier knows there is your\nmailbox, that's where I drop the mail.\n\n306\n00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:49.220\nAll right, well,\nimagine today they deliver the mail.\n\n307\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.300\nAnd right after you take the mail out of\nthe mailbox, before the next day comes,\n\n308\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.130\nyou take that mailbox, you rip it up,\nand you throw it in the backyard.\n\n309\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.290\nMail carrier says, well,\nwhere's the mailbox?\n\n310\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.340\nI can't deliver your mail,\nI don't know where it's located.\n\n311\n00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.700\nI don't know where\nthe location is to deliver it.\n\n312\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.320\nAnd that's why there are certain devices\non your networks, like printers, right.\n\n313\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.341\nPrinters are a good example, right?\n\n314\n00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:12.906\nI don't want,\nif they're connected to the network,\n\n315\n00:15:12.906 --> 00:15:14.869\nI don't want their IP address to change.\n\n316\n00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:18.995\nSo that all of our devices know\nwhere to send that information.\n\n317\n00:15:18.995 --> 00:15:22.735\nAnd that’s where static assignment, like\nDan says, we need to use it sometimes.\n\n318\n00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:25.185\nThere are devices that we want\nto know their IP address, and\n\n319\n00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:26.366\nwe don’t want it to change.\n\n320\n00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:29.174\n&gt;&gt; Wes, going along with your\nwhole mailman situation or\n\n321\n00:15:29.174 --> 00:15:31.355\nmail carrier situation.\n\n322\n00:15:31.355 --> 00:15:34.561\nThink of it this way,\nif you were moving once a week, right?\n\n323\n00:15:34.561 --> 00:15:37.219\nYou moved to a different house every week,\nand\n\n324\n00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:39.820\nthe mailman's trying to deliver your mail.\n\n325\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.790\nAnd it says Daniel Lowrie on it, right?\n\n326\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:46.240\nIf that's all it said, he's gonna be like,\nI have no idea where this is gonna go.\n\n327\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.970\nHe was here last week, and\nnow apparently he's not there.\n\n328\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.648\nWhere did he go?\n\n329\n00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:52.350\nIf I'm a server,\nI need to be in the same spot.\n\n330\n00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.661\nI don't move, I need to be unchanging.\n\n331\n00:15:54.661 --> 00:15:57.730\nSo that mailman, all he has to do is say,\nDaniel Lowrie, I know where that goes.\n\n332\n00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:58.990\nThat always goes here.\n\n333\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.708\nThat never goes anywhere else but here.\n\n334\n00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:03.228\nBecause if we start\nchanging the game on him,\n\n335\n00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:06.060\nhe's gonna be utterly confused and\nyou're never gonna get your mail.\n\n336\n00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.270\nThe service is gonna break down,\n\n337\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.500\nthe people that need that\nservice aren't gonna get it.\n\n338\n00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.110\nBecause it's been changing, so\nthat's why we need sometimes static, and\n\n339\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.154\nsometimes dynamic.\n\n340\n00:16:14.154 --> 00:16:18.246\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that's a great classic\nexample right there of why sometimes\n\n341\n00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:19.990\nwe don't want things to change.\n\n342\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\nwe need them to stay the same.\n\n343\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.013\n&gt;&gt; We're not talking about being\nresistant to change, right?\n\n344\n00:16:24.013 --> 00:16:28.740\nChange is inevitable, growth is optional,\nI think I heard a wise man say one time.\n\n345\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.080\nSo how do we get a dynamic IP address,\nright?\n\n346\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.920\nWe've been kinda, hinting at it.\n\n347\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.260\nWe've been talking about a service, so\n\n348\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.960\nlet's talk about a little\nbit more about that.\n\n349\n00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.430\nIn other episodes, we've talked\nabout ports and protocols, and\n\n350\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:46.250\none of those protocols, remember protocols\nare the rules of communication for\n\n351\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.000\na specific type of service.\n\n352\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.290\nThat service is something known as DHCP.\n\n353\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.850\nIt's called\nthe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n354\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.270\nIt is responsible for\ngiving you IP addresses.\n\n355\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.930\nNow I always try with A+\nstudents because some people just\n\n356\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.760\nfocus on the fact that it\nhands out IP addresses.\n\n357\n00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.250\nI want you to break down the name.\n\n358\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.920\nThe acronym is one acronym that really\ndescribes what it's doing, right?\n\n359\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.300\nIf I say serial ATA, we've hit you guys\nwith a lot of acronyms out there, that\n\n360\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.670\nreally doesn't tell me anything other than\nmaybe it tastes good with milk, right?\n\n361\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.540\nSerial ATA makes no sense unless\nyou've studied it, right?\n\n362\n00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:30.183\nIf I say this is a dynamic, subject to\nchange, host configuration protocol,\n\n363\n00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:35.066\nit means it's going to provide me\nwith some kind of configuration.\n\n364\n00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:38.422\nAnd I want you to keep that in mind\nbecause not only does it give me IP\n\n365\n00:17:38.422 --> 00:17:42.147\naddresses, but it gives me access to\nour subnet mask, the home router,\n\n366\n00:17:42.147 --> 00:17:45.934\nthe default gateway that you send\ninformation out there to the internet or\n\n367\n00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.270\noff of your network.\n\n368\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.710\nAs well as things like name servers\nthat we're gonna talk about coming up.\n\n369\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.744\nWe won't leave you hanging on that one,\nall right?\n\n370\n00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:58.680\nSo it's called the Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol, DHCP server.\n\n371\n00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.390\nNow, when we talk about the DHCP server,\n\n372\n00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:06.630\nI wanna just talk real briefly about the\nprocess that your computer goes through.\n\n373\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.160\nRemember we keep saying,\nit calls out to the network.\n\n374\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.120\nWell, what is it doing?\n\n375\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.190\nIs it standing from the top of the roof\nand just shouting at the rooftops or\n\n376\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.460\noff the side of the mountain, right?\n\n377\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.400\nIs it doing a yodel?\n\n378\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.330\n[LAUGH] No, not really.\n\n379\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.310\nWhat's going on is there's\na four step process.\n\n380\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.000\nAnd there is a little mnemonic I guess,\nnot really mnemonic,\n\n381\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.220\nI guess it's more of just\nan acronym that helps us remember.\n\n382\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.648\nI know Dan, I know you've known this for\na very long time, and\n\n383\n00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:32.924\nit's called DORA, all right?\n\n384\n00:18:32.924 --> 00:18:34.730\nThe DORA process, all right?\n\n385\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:39.770\nDiscover, Offer, Request,\nAcknowledge, all right?\n\n386\n00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.360\nNow Discover, what does that mean?\n\n387\n00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.948\nAll right, well Discover means I'm gonna\ncall out to the network and when I say I,\n\n388\n00:18:45.948 --> 00:18:48.600\nI mean the network adapter\nthat's using this DHCP service.\n\n389\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.664\nIt's expecting to call out\nto the network and say,\n\n390\n00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:53.930\nanybody got an IP address out there?\n\n391\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.450\nIn fact, rather than just explain it,\nlet's kinda show you,\n\n392\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.600\nI got a diagram here to kinda help out.\n\n393\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.180\nSo if my computer or any device that is\nusing that service, could be all kinds of\n\n394\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.760\ndevices that we could set for\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n395\n00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.390\nWhat happens in the discovery process,\njust think of it, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n396\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.240\nreal briefly it's just hey,\nanybody out there got an IP address?\n\n397\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.730\nI need one, right?\n\n398\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.800\nAnd then the offer, an offer comes\nback and this is the server.\n\n399\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.430\nIt doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a highly optimized computer,\n\n400\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.770\nit could be your home access point.\n\n401\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.740\nI've seen modems to this as well,\nit's a service.\n\n402\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:32.500\nAnd then the device that is providing\nthat service says, here's an IP address.\n\n403\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.690\nI've got this IP,\nconsider it a configuration package.\n\n404\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.101\nI've got this for you, it's gonna have\nthis IP address, subnet mask, and yeah,\n\n405\n00:19:39.101 --> 00:19:42.059\nit could have your name server in there,\ndefault gateway, all right?\n\n406\n00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:45.720\nThen what happens is we make a request.\n\n407\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.400\nYour device says back to that server yeah,\nI'll take that information and\n\n408\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.430\nthen the last thing that\nhappens is an acknowledgment.\n\n409\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:58.330\nNow I don't have any great cute little\nexplanation for the acknowledge but\n\n410\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.490\nthe acknowledge is the DHCP server saying,\nkind of like if you rent a car.\n\n411\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.530\nIf you rent a car, you've got a certain\ntime that you can lease that car, right?\n\n412\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.690\nAnd what do they do?\n\n413\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.370\nThey don't lease that car to somebody\nelse while you're in the middle of\n\n414\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.630\ndriving it, right?\n\n415\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.230\nSo what they do is they kind of\nbookmark it in their notes or\n\n416\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.770\nwrite in their database and they say,\nyeah, you got that car for a week.\n\n417\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.417\nWell, that's kind of\nwhat happens with DHCP.\n\n418\n00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.945\nIt says, so\nyou're gonna take that IP address,\n\n419\n00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:24.823\nI can't give that to anybody else, so I\nacknowledge that you're gonna take it and\n\n420\n00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:27.145\nI'm gonna mark it in the list as yours for\na week.\n\n421\n00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:29.508\nNow if you don't communicate\nback with me in a week,\n\n422\n00:20:29.508 --> 00:20:32.100\nwhat's gonna happen is I'm\ngonna take that IP address.\n\n423\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.390\nI'm gonna put it back in the list and\nsorry, no food for you,\n\n424\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.660\nyou don't get it, right?\n\n425\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.310\nSo that's the dynamic nature of it, right?\n\n426\n00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.370\nAnd back to the analogy that we've kind\nof been pushing here with the mailbox.\n\n427\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.210\nYou don't want your mailbox just\nbeing thrown in the backyard, right?\n\n428\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.090\nSo you have services on your\nnetwork that sometimes,\n\n429\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:52.190\nlike the DHCP server, that you wanna\nmake that sure you can find them.\n\n430\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.560\nNow, with a DHCP server,\n\n431\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.470\nit is one that's kind of interesting\nbecause you don't have an IP address.\n\n432\n00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.870\nBut typically the DHCP service is being\nprovided by things like your home router\n\n433\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.150\nwithin your networks and\n\n434\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.130\nwe do have dedicated devices in\nmore corporate environments.\n\n435\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:12.300\nSo I want you to remember Discover, Offer,\nRequest, Acknowledge, the DORA process.\n\n436\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.520\nIt is the process that allows the DHCP\nservice to perform dynamic addressing.\n\n437\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.030\nI also want you to remember,\n\n438\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.100\njust like we've been talking about,\nstatic addressing.\n\n439\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.370\nStatic addressing also has its purpose,\nright?\n\n440\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.780\nBut let's get out of the home\nnetwork environment.\n\n441\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.190\nLet's talk about a company\nthat Dan used to work for\n\n442\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.510\nwhere there are thousands of devices.\n\n443\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.536\nHundreds and thousands if not thousands\nand he can clarify if I'm wrong on that\n\n444\n00:21:36.536 --> 00:21:39.408\none, but definitely hundreds of devices,\nall right?\n\n445\n00:21:39.408 --> 00:21:42.609\nIt is a very administrative\nprocess to go through and\n\n446\n00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:47.269\nmanually configure an IP address,\nmanually configure a default gateway,\n\n447\n00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:51.003\n[LAUGH] manually configure a subnet mask,\na name if you will.\n\n448\n00:21:51.003 --> 00:21:54.763\nAnd tons of other things you can do\nwith DHCP, it's really flexible,\n\n449\n00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:56.239\n500 to 1000 times.\n\n450\n00:21:56.239 --> 00:21:59.610\nLet alone, like we've been talking\nconfiguration errors, right?\n\n451\n00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.960\nSo in those aspects, those devices,\n\n452\n00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.510\nyou want to let a service provide\nthat functionality for you so\n\n453\n00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.655\nyou get consistency and\nyou get what Microsoft, in their mindset,\n\n454\n00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:15.510\ncalls a lot of times the least amount\nof administrative effort, right?\n\n455\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.390\nThat's a good thing, right?\n\n456\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.810\nWork smarter not harder, right?\n\n457\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.140\nYou've heard that before and\nDan, would you agree with that?\n\n458\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.480\nI mean, in that company I know you,\nthat was a big company,\n\n459\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.840\nI mean you had hundreds if not\nthousands of computers, right?\n\n460\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely did, not to\nmention not just computers but printers,\n\n461\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.270\nand switches and routers and things,\nanything connected to the network\n\n462\n00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.180\nrequires an IP address so\nthey can communicate, right?\n\n463\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.620\nAnd if I had to go through each\none of those things manually,\n\n464\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.850\nspecifically when it comes to things\nlike workstations, laptops, tablets,\n\n465\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.880\nphones, that would be a nightmare.\n\n466\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.890\nI would hate my life.\n\n467\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.260\nI'd be looking for that,\nwhere's that Truck Masters number?\n\n468\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.599\nI'm gonna go drive a truck for\nmy life cuz this is a horrible job, right?\n\n469\n00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:55.864\nIt would not be fun.\n\n470\n00:22:55.864 --> 00:23:00.213\nSo we do use static IPs on things\nlike our servers and our gateways,\n\n471\n00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:01.774\nthings of that nature.\n\n472\n00:23:01.774 --> 00:23:05.338\nBut for the workstations, man,\nlet DHCP do the heavy lifting on that.\n\n473\n00:23:05.338 --> 00:23:07.171\nYou know it's gonna get\nit right every time and\n\n474\n00:23:07.171 --> 00:23:09.270\nif doesn't everybody's getting it wrong.\n\n475\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.590\nYou make your configuration\nchange at the server and\n\n476\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.860\nthen it goes out to everybody and then,\neveryone's corrected from one change.\n\n477\n00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.560\nSo it's better to work, when it comes to\nthose types of things, with the DHCP.\n\n478\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.450\nLet it do the heavy lifting and\nthen just leave the servers.\n\n479\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.320\nThat's going to be a much smaller pool of\nresources that you have to administrate\n\n480\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.910\nthan working with a large\ncompany with workstations.\n\n481\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.450\nThat would be be crazy.\n\n482\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I guess if you're\ngetting paid hourly?\n\n483\n00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:38.270\nI'm perfectly fine, I'll start today,\nand if I'm done in a month,\n\n484\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.967\nI'll be good but most people probably\nwon't get paid hourly that way.\n\n485\n00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:43.746\n&gt;&gt; It'd be a never ending job.\n\n486\n00:23:43.746 --> 00:23:44.965\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n487\n00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:49.020\nIt's kind of like mowing a 500\nacre property with a push mower.\n\n488\n00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.784\nBy the time you get done you\nhave to start over again.\n\n489\n00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:53.580\nSo very cyclic process.\n\n490\n00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.030\nNow Dan, I'm kinda looking at the time and\nI hate to say this but\n\n491\n00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.520\nwe might have to go into a part five.\n\n492\n00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.680\nBecause we wanna just, and we're gonna get\ninto a troubleshooting episode where we\n\n493\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.150\ntroubleshoot network connections.\n\n494\n00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.160\nBut I've kinda thrown around just\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n495\n00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.990\nI wanna kinda go through\nthat a little bit more.\n\n496\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.910\nMention a couple of commands that you\ncould kinda see if you will the TCP/IP\n\n497\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.250\nproperties of your network adapters.\n\n498\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.460\nAnd we still gotta talk about another\nvery important service out there\n\n499\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.800\nthat allows us to basically not\nhave to remember IP addresses, but\n\n500\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.620\nstill connect to devices over the network.\n\n501\n00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.990\nSpecifically, things like the internet.\n\n502\n00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.697\nSo, unfortunately,\n\n503\n00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:31.016\nI think we're gonna have to leave them\nwith a little bit of a cliffhanger.\n\n504\n00:24:31.016 --> 00:24:33.460\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nsometimes that's the way it rolls.\n\n505\n00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.530\nBut, what are you gonna do, right?\n\n506\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.430\nThat's the way of life.\n\n507\n00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.520\nAnyway, so thanks Wes.\n\n508\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.670\nWe look forward to seeing you and\nthat upcoming part five, but as for\n\n509\n00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.630\nthis episode, we're gonna go ahead and\nshut it down.\n\n510\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.680\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n511\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.975\nWe'll see you in that part five,\nas well, hopefully.\n\n512\n00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:48.855\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n513\n00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:49.715\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n514\n00:24:49.715 --> 00:24:50.795\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n515\n00:24:50.795 --> 00:24:58.319\n[MUSIC]\n\n516\n00:24:58.319 --> 00:25:01.139\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.628\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.265\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:13.999\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.197\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:18.885\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.243\nit's more in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:22.237\nActually continuing on\nwith our conversation,\n\n10\n00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:24.384\nhopefully even rounding it out today,\non TCP/IP.\n\n11\n00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:28.013\nAnd, of course, joining us back in\nthe studio to actually lead us in said\n\n12\n00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:31.773\nconversation, our good friend, Mr.\nWes Bryan, Wes, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nI'm hoping it is.\n\n14\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.712\nIt has definitely been a journey uphill,\nwe hit the top of the hill,\n\n15\n00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:41.258\nand now hopefully we are over the hill.\n\n16\n00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:42.412\nAnd by over the hill I mean Dan's old.\n\n17\n00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:44.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding, that's right,\n\n18\n00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:47.615\nwe are on that downward slope,\nand I don't mean in a bad way.\n\n19\n00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.919\nSo we do have some additional things\nthat we want to talk about, and\n\n20\n00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:54.880\nI'm gonna throw one to Dan that I didn't\neven let him know that we were gonna do.\n\n21\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.438\nBecause there is one last little address\ntype that I kinda wanna talk about,\n\n22\n00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:00.508\nthat we really haven't touched base with.\n\n23\n00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:03.300\nAnd that is something known as\na media access control address.\n\n24\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.614\nWe've been talking a lot\nabout IP addresses, and\n\n25\n00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.049\ntalking about the properties\nof a network adapter.\n\n26\n00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.669\nBut I just realized, quite literally\nwhen they said, roll that footage,\n\n27\n00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:14.375\nthat we need to talk about\none last little address here.\n\n28\n00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.790\nAnd let's go ahead and\ntalk about what a MAC address is.\n\n29\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.250\nI don't really have a diagram,\n\n30\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.350\nbecause really,\nwe're shooting from the hip on this one.\n\n31\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.030\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you where you can find it,\n\n32\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.840\nand then we'll talk about\nit real briefly here.\n\n33\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.611\nSo I've got my Windows\nmachine here pulled up, and\n\n34\n00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:32.390\nsame thing that we've been in for\na while, right?\n\n35\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.965\nWe're in Network and Sharing Center,\nlike the last four episodes prior to this.\n\n36\n00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:42.008\nAnd I'm gonna ahead and I'm gonna bring\nup the properties of the network adapter,\n\n37\n00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.560\nagain, by choosing\nChange Network Adapter Properties.\n\n38\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.090\nI believe that's what it says, let's find\nout again, yeah, change adapter settings.\n\n39\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.440\nAnd we're gonna right click, and we're\ngonna go ahead and choose Status, and\n\n40\n00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.250\nthen we're gonna choose Details again.\n\n41\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.773\nAnd I do wanna just take a second here,\nreal briefly,\n\n42\n00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:02.432\ncuz there is one address here that I\nkind of think we have to, well, address.\n\n43\n00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:05.442\nAnd that is something known\nas the physical address, and\n\n44\n00:02:05.442 --> 00:02:08.780\nit's also known as the MAC address,\nthat you might hear.\n\n45\n00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.768\nThat's called a media access\ncontrol address, right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:15.318\nIP addresses, they're what are known\nas logical addresses, we can set and\n\n47\n00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:16.649\ndefine these in software and\n\n48\n00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.269\nit's the same concept that we've been\ntalking about in the prior episodes.\n\n49\n00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.574\nBut there is also an address that is\nliterally hard coded into the network\n\n50\n00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:28.610\nadapter that identifies the adapter\nat the physical level as well.\n\n51\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.165\nAnd I mean as much so\nas identifying the manufacturer,\n\n52\n00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:36.928\nas well as uniquely identifying\nthe adapter within that manufacturer.\n\n53\n00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:39.420\nAnd you can see right here,\nwe have that physical address, and\n\n54\n00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.570\nlike I said, this is what Microsoft calls\nit, because it's physically burned in.\n\n55\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.330\nYou might hear it called it a BIA address,\nor BIA, excuse me, burned in address.\n\n56\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.110\nNow, you'll notice here that this address,\nI'll click out of there so\n\n57\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.770\nyou guys can see it right here.\n\n58\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.230\nNotice that we have one,\ntwo, three, four, five,\n\n59\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.720\nsix different individual blocks right?\n\n60\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.690\nThese individual blocks here are comprised\nof two different components, right?\n\n61\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.217\nThese are actually six bytes or\n48 bits individually, and\n\n62\n00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:15.274\nthe first three bytes that we have,\nthis is what's known as an OUI,\n\n63\n00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:18.489\nan organizationally unique identifier.\n\n64\n00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.007\nI want you to know OUI for\nthe exam, but let's\n\n65\n00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:25.590\nmake it a little bit more simplistic,\nit doesn't have to be so highly technical.\n\n66\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.090\nIt's a vendor ID, essentially what\nit does, you have a lot of different\n\n67\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.070\ncompanies out there, I believe it's\nIntel that makes this network adapter.\n\n68\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.712\nAnd I'd almost be willing to bet that,\nor you know what,\n\n69\n00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:37.373\nI know who this network adapter is.\n\n70\n00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:41.340\nThis is actually a VM ware adapter,\nso this is a VM ware OUI.\n\n71\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.775\nAnd it just says, when I look at these\nfirst three bytes of information expressed\n\n72\n00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.253\nin a hexadecimal format,\nit means that hey,\n\n73\n00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:50.944\nwe can identify that\nthat's the manufacturer.\n\n74\n00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:53.792\nAnd they have to go to IANA or\nICANN, if you will,\n\n75\n00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:57.900\nremember the Internet Assigned\nNumbers Authority in the early days.\n\n76\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.440\nToday, it's ICANN, Internet Corporation\nfor Assigned Names and Numbers.\n\n77\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.980\nAnd if you're gonna manufacture\na network address that's gonna be\n\n78\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.090\nput in a computer and connected to\na network, you have to register with them.\n\n79\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.689\nAnd they give you an identifier,\nthat's the OUI.\n\n80\n00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.390\n&gt;&gt; I did look it up on just a, you can\ngo to Google and type these things in.\n\n81\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.018\nI just typed OUI, and\nthen those digits and letters, and\n\n82\n00:04:18.018 --> 00:04:20.533\nit did come up with VMWare Inc.\n\n83\n00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:21.522\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n84\n00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:23.336\n&gt;&gt; If you're unsure, you're like,\nwho makes this board?\n\n85\n00:04:23.336 --> 00:04:26.849\nYou can just look at that MAC, if that's\nall that you have maybe, or looking at\n\n86\n00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.980\na MAC address table inside of a switch or\nsomething, you're like, what is that?\n\n87\n00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.642\nYou can verify that it is something that\nyour company has actually purchased, and\n\n88\n00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:36.834\nnot maybe a random\ncomputer that's connected.\n\n89\n00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:39.816\n&gt;&gt; And there's so many of them, I swear\nI have every one of them in my brain.\n\n90\n00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:40.317\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you do.\n\n91\n00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:42.633\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's because-\n\n92\n00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:43.748\n&gt;&gt; No he don't.\n\n93\n00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:45.691\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not even close.\n\n94\n00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:48.954\nAnd that's just because we use\nsome components here quite a lot,\n\n95\n00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:50.450\nso I've seen them a lot here.\n\n96\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.855\nI certainly don't have them memorized,\nand I do exactly what Dan did,\n\n97\n00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:55.916\nI would do what's known as the OUI search.\n\n98\n00:04:55.916 --> 00:05:01.393\nNow, if we go back to the screen here,\nthere's another set of three bytes,\n\n99\n00:05:01.393 --> 00:05:04.140\nor the 24 bits here towards the end.\n\n100\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.400\nAgain, remember, expressed in hexadecimal\nformat, that are what are known as the,\n\n101\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.630\nthis is, this essentially\nidentifies the adapter itself.\n\n102\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.331\nI've heard a crazy name\ncalled the ULAN MAC, right.\n\n103\n00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:20.970\nThat's the Universal Local Area Network,\nMedia Access Control address.\n\n104\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.160\nDon't even worry about that,\nit identifies the network adapter.\n\n105\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.364\nOUI, I definitely want you to know,\nthat could come up on the exam,\n\n106\n00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:28.445\nknow it as a vendor ID.\n\n107\n00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:32.272\nBut what happens is VMWare or\nIntel out there, BroadCom,\n\n108\n00:05:32.272 --> 00:05:37.820\nthere's all kinds of manufacturers,\nGigabyte makes them and stuff as well.\n\n109\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.313\nBelieve it or not, Xerox,\nbecause they have network based printers,\n\n110\n00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:45.519\nthey also have an OUI, IBM.\n\n111\n00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:49.250\nIf a company manufactures, let's say,\n30,000 of these network adapters,\n\n112\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.650\nyou have to be able to uniquely identify\neach one of those network adapters.\n\n113\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.140\nAnd that's why this is unique\nto the vendor itself, and\n\n114\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.220\nthat's because, remember,\nwe need unique identities for\n\n115\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.810\nthe devices that\nare connected to the network.\n\n116\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.729\nIt's no different than what we were\ntalking about in the first few episodes\n\n117\n00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:05.576\nabout IP addresses.\n\n118\n00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:09.620\nI have to uniquely identify the network\nadapter as well, and again,\n\n119\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.310\nI can't manipulate this to a certain\nextent, we're not gonna get into there.\n\n120\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.998\nThere are some things that you\ncan kinda manipulate it, but\n\n121\n00:06:15.998 --> 00:06:17.395\nyou don't have to worry about that for\nthe exam.\n\n122\n00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:21.750\nBut for the most part, if I've got a\nphysical expansion card that has this MAC\n\n123\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.900\naddress burned into it,\nI can't modify that.\n\n124\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.460\nIt uniquely identifies\nthe network adapter and\n\n125\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.260\nby association the computer\nthat it is installed in.\n\n126\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.063\nAnd that is important, to remember\nthat we have unique identifiers.\n\n127\n00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:41.560\nSo media access control address, in the\nMicrosoft world called a physical address.\n\n128\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.905\nRemember, could be called a BIA,\na burned in address.\n\n129\n00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:48.448\nTwo components, two parts,\ntotal of 48 bits, three bytes apiece or\n\n130\n00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:50.000\nsix bytes total.\n\n131\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.318\nThe first three bytes are the\norganizationally unique identifier, and\n\n132\n00:06:54.318 --> 00:06:59.204\nthe last three bytes identify that adapter\nuniquely within the manufacturer that\n\n133\n00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:01.624\nis essentially producing it to market.\n\n134\n00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:05.999\nOne thing that I wanted to kinda talk\nabout here, off the cuff there, without,\n\n135\n00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:10.111\nagain, we didn't script this one,\nso good job, Dan, jumping in there,\n\n136\n00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:12.370\nbecause I threw him a curveball.\n\n137\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks a lot Wes, appreciate\nthe off the cuff, off the fly thing.\n\n138\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.408\nYou didn't even prep me for it, but the\ngood thing is I know a little about that.\n\n139\n00:07:19.408 --> 00:07:23.133\n&gt;&gt; Yes, most absolutely, it isn't his\nfirst day at the rodeo by any means.\n\n140\n00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:26.750\nI did want to throw that one in there,\nI did tell you at the end of the last part\n\n141\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.163\nhere that we would talk\nabout a naming system, and\n\n142\n00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:31.860\nthat's what we're gonna\ntalk about right now.\n\n143\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.448\nAnd, with a naming system, what we're\ntalking about is something known as DNS.\n\n144\n00:07:35.448 --> 00:07:39.110\nWe talked about DHCP being\na host configuration protocol.\n\n145\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.470\nThat allows you to communicate,\nor basically,\n\n146\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.400\ndynamically receive an IP address and\nsome other configuration information.\n\n147\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.241\nYour subnet mask and your default gateway,\nand I also mentioned a naming server, so\n\n148\n00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:52.616\nwhat do we mean by that?\n\n149\n00:07:52.616 --> 00:07:56.739\nWell, I want you to think about an IP\naddress, and you probably have seen,\n\n150\n00:07:56.739 --> 00:08:00.353\neven if it's for the first time,\nthat IP addresses are complex.\n\n151\n00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:03.659\nThey can be, especially if\nyou're first getting into them.\n\n152\n00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:08.258\nNow imagine somebody that is not you\nOut there going for a certification,\n\n153\n00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:10.199\nwanting to be in the industry.\n\n154\n00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.620\nSomebody that just says you know what,\nI want to turn on my computer.\n\n155\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.780\nI want to open Chrome,\nInternet Explorer, Firefox, Safari.\n\n156\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.040\nI just want to connect to Google, or\n\n157\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.120\nI just want to connect to Microsoft,\nor I just want to connect to ITPRO.TV.\n\n158\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.910\nWe do not type IP addresses\ninside of a web browser right?\n\n159\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.020\nAnd, why is that?\n\n160\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.240\nWell, we have another service or\n\n161\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.930\nprotocol out there that we've\ntalked about before, right?\n\n162\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.380\nDNS, the Domain Name System,\noperates on TCP/IP Protocol port 53.\n\n163\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.510\nWell, that naming system\nis responsible for\n\n164\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:46.810\ntaking a user-friendly name,\na name that it's a lot easier to remember,\n\n165\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.560\nand mapping it, if you will, or\nassociating it with an IP address.\n\n166\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.400\nIn fact,\nI've got a little diagram here, and\n\n167\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.170\nI want you to think about again\nwhat you type in your web search.\n\n168\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.060\nIf you're going to type,\ngo to a web page, right?\n\n169\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.245\nYou type the URL, in the Uniform Resource\nLocator, you've probably in your web\n\n170\n00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:10.850\nbrowsers,http://www.itpro.tv.\n\n171\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.660\nWell what's interesting is we\ncommunicate via IP addresses,\n\n172\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.700\nthat's the way TCP works.\n\n173\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.500\nIt works on your IP addresses, but\nthe domain name system allows us\n\n174\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.710\nsomething kinda unique and\nthe fact that we can remember names.\n\n175\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.200\nAnd in the background what it's doing\nis it's calling out to the network and\n\n176\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.390\nsaying, hey, where is www.microsoft.com?\n\n177\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.870\nWhere is www .google.com?\n\n178\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.517\nAnd we can remember the names, cuz as\nhumans it's a lot easier to remember.\n\n179\n00:09:38.517 --> 00:09:41.530\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like we used to remember phone\nnumbers, we don't do that anymore.\n\n180\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.850\nWe just say to my phone, call Wes, or\nI look Wes up in my contacts list.\n\n181\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.650\nI just find his name and I click on it,\nand it dials his number for me.\n\n182\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.930\nKinda the same idea, right?\n\n183\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.190\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly the same idea.\n\n184\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.181\nAnd it makes it easier to remember how\nto dial somebody's number until you lose\n\n185\n00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:58.552\nyour phone, right?\n\n186\n00:09:58.552 --> 00:10:03.730\n[LAUGH] And that's a classic example of\nwhere you would see this mapping, right?\n\n187\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.540\nIt's not that it's dialing Wes,\nif you will, within those digits, right?\n\n188\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.190\nBut it maps it, if you will,\nand associates it.\n\n189\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.350\nSo that is what domain name system is.\n\n190\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.210\nNow, I wanna talk a bit more about that\nname because there are some components,\n\n191\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.622\nright, inside of the name\nthat you need to know about,\n\n192\n00:10:19.622 --> 00:10:21.590\ngot to get a little bit\nmore technical with that.\n\n193\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.680\nAll right, so\nwhat names are we talking about?\n\n194\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.870\nWhen we talk about names we're talking\nabout something known as an FQDN, right?\n\n195\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.710\nAn FQDN is\na Fully Qualified Domain Name and\n\n196\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.630\nit's comprised of a couple\nof different pieces, right?\n\n197\n00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.790\nJust like we said the Mac\naddress is two different pieces,\n\n198\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.290\nan IP address has a network portion and\na node portion.\n\n199\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.120\nWell, a Fully Qualified Domain Name\nis actually comprised of two parts.\n\n200\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.300\nThe first part is what's\nknown as the host name.\n\n201\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.560\nWhen we talk about a host name what we are\ntalking about typically is a computer name\n\n202\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.990\nor device state.\n\n203\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.785\nThen, the other portion of\nthat FQDN is the domain name.\n\n204\n00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:57.115\nAnd why do we say fully qualified?\n\n205\n00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.805\nAll right,\nsee DNS works on a hierarchical system.\n\n206\n00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:03.615\nAnd what we mean by this\nis that it's broken down\n\n207\n00:11:03.615 --> 00:11:08.705\ninto individual components that\nmakes it unique across the Internet.\n\n208\n00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:12.155\nNow, an earlier naming convention\nthat has been out for a long time.\n\n209\n00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:15.115\nAnd I mean, it's still used in Windows,\nbut it's kind of a legacy technology,\n\n210\n00:11:15.115 --> 00:11:16.603\nan older technology, is NetBIOS.\n\n211\n00:11:16.603 --> 00:11:21.130\nAll right, NetBIOS again,\nthe Network Basic Input Output System,\n\n212\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:26.330\nwas a way that you could take a single\nname, a host name just by itself and\n\n213\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.580\nmap it to an IP address.\n\n214\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.405\nBut it isn't unique enough,\nthere isn't a uniqueness to that,\n\n215\n00:11:32.405 --> 00:11:34.535\ncuz I want you to take\nsomebody like Daniel's name.\n\n216\n00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:38.070\nWes' name it's a little bit more rare but\n\n217\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.970\nit's still not even rare in the larger\nscheme of 7 billion people.\n\n218\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.730\nBut you take a name like Daniel or\na name like John or a name like Bill, Bob,\n\n219\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.440\nSally Suzie, right?\n\n220\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.730\nWe're talking about names themselves that\ndon't really have a uniqueness to them,\n\n221\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.730\nbut when we put a middle name and\n\n222\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.450\nwe put the last name there,\nit kinda gives it some kind of uniqueness.\n\n223\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.920\nNow, NetBIOS would only be a single name.\n\n224\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.240\nIt would be like saying, okay,\nI'm looking for a computer named Dan, and\n\n225\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.930\nwe're gonna map it to this IP address.\n\n226\n00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.870\nThe problem is other networks might have\na computer out there named Dan, right?\n\n227\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.730\nSo client01 would be a host name,\n\n228\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.590\nwould be a NetBIOS name but\nit wouldn't be unique across the internet.\n\n229\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.190\nSo that's why we need\nthis hierarchical system.\n\n230\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.190\nSo that's why if we go ahead and bring up\nthe Fully Qualified Domain Name again,\n\n231\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.870\nyou see that we have\nclient01 the host name.\n\n232\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.800\nAnd then we have something that's unique\nto the company or corporation if you will.\n\n233\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.180\nIn this case, a domain,\n\n234\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.260\nin which it exists because\nthe domain itself is unique, right.\n\n235\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.370\nWe can't have two itpro.tvs out there or\n\n236\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.040\nYou guys aren't going to know\nwhich one to visit, right?\n\n237\n00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.270\nSo it has to be unique\nacross the internet.\n\n238\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.040\nNow you can get some example of, and\n\n239\n00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.460\nI've got some examples of some different\ntypes of Fully Qualified Domain Names.\n\n240\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.190\nNotice that they have the host name and\n\n241\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.950\nthey have a unique domain\nname to everyone one of them.\n\n242\n00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.640\nThe other thing to keep\nin mind is that hey,\n\n243\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.030\nmaybe we do have a client01\ninside of a Microsoft domain.\n\n244\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.090\nWell, guess what?\n\n245\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.020\nNow it's unique.\n\n246\n00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.860\nIt's not like the NetBIOS\nof a single name,\n\n247\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.550\nbecause the domain names are different.\n\n248\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.730\nSo this is something that\nwe have to keep in mind,\n\n249\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.790\ntaking a Fully Qualified Domain Name and\nmapping it to an IP address.\n\n250\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.480\nNow you have other types of\nnames that we type in, and\n\n251\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.020\nit makes it a little\nbit easier to remember.\n\n252\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.050\nYou might even see something like,\nfor instance, for\n\n253\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.990\nevery one of these,\nwe've got www.microsoft.com, right?\n\n254\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.380\nWe've got www.googgle.com.\n\n255\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.250\nWe also have, well, you probably\nguessed it, www..facebook.com.\n\n256\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:42.978\nNotice that we have a unique host\nname as well as a unique domain name.\n\n257\n00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:46.114\nNow, we'll go when to a little bit more\nnetwork in plus on DNS itself because\n\n258\n00:13:46.114 --> 00:13:48.674\nthere are somethings that\nare happen to me behind the scenes.\n\n259\n00:13:48.674 --> 00:13:52.660\nBut that's a lot easier to remember\nthan whatever the IP address is.\n\n260\n00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.880\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n261\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.530\nWell, let's go ahead and let's dive down\ninto our command prompt here for a second.\n\n262\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.050\n&gt;&gt; I think what you mean\nis I defy anyone to\n\n263\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.320\noff the top of their head tell me\nwhat Facebook's IP address is.\n\n264\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.965\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n265\n00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:04.521\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n266\n00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:07.420\nYeah, thanks for\nthe clarification on that on, for sure.\n\n267\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.560\nI don't know what it is.\n\n268\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.730\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nlet's find out,\n\n269\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.230\nlet's say, let's find out what\nMicrosoft's IP address is\\, or\n\n270\n00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.510\none of the many that they have,\nit's not a single one, right?\n\n271\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:23.030\nSo we're gonna use a utility called\nnslookup, if I can spell it right.\n\n272\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:28.980\nNslookup, and we're gonna do,\nlet's just do www.Microfsot.com.\n\n273\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.880\nLet's find out what an IP address is.\n\n274\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.390\nNow, keep this in mind, who would want\nto have to type something like this\n\n275\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.080\nevery time they want to\ngo to Mircofosft.com?\n\n276\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.460\nWe don't want to have to type that, but\nif I did type this into a search engine.\n\n277\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.360\nI'm not too sure that I can copy this.\n\n278\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.220\nWell, let's try.\n\n279\n00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.180\nAll right, Dan, do me a favor here.\n\n280\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.790\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n281\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.160\n&gt;&gt; Can you remember that, maybe or,\n&gt;&gt; I could write it down.\n\n282\n00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.609\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\nyou type that down, yeah, go ahead.\n\n283\n00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:54.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, read it off for me.\n\n284\n00:14:54.712 --> 00:14:56.894\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do\n&gt;&gt; We're going to do 23.\n\n285\n00:14:56.894 --> 00:14:57.838\n&gt;&gt; 23 dots.\n\n286\n00:14:57.838 --> 00:14:59.917\n&gt;&gt; 128\n&gt;&gt; 128\n\n287\n00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:00.429\n&gt;&gt; .251\n\n288\n00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:01.549\n&gt;&gt; 251\n\n289\n00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:03.014\n&gt;&gt; .228, all right?\n\n290\n00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:05.269\n&gt;&gt; 228, all right.\nNow what we're going to do is we're going\n\n291\n00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:09.380\nto kind of go back to our browser here\nreal quick, and I'm going to type that.\n\n292\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.940\nCan you read that off to me?\n\n293\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.119\n&gt;&gt; 23.128\n&gt;&gt; 128\n\n294\n00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:15.793\n&gt;&gt; .251\n\n295\n00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:18.102\n&gt;&gt; .251.\n\n296\n00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:19.551\n&gt;&gt; 228.\n\n297\n00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:24.410\n&gt;&gt; 228, and let me just double check,\nmake sure that I said that right,\n\n298\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.085\ncuz I think that was a 198,\nI think I told you wrong.\n\n299\n00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:30.150\n198.251, yeah,\nI told you that second octet wrong.\n\n300\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.740\nAnd let's go ahead and connect.\n\n301\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.830\nAnd it's an invalid URL.\n\n302\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.230\nLet's try http.\n\n303\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.920\nGot to put the right format there.\n\n304\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.220\nI know what's kind of going on here for\nsecurity purposes.\n\n305\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.050\nThey don't want you to have direct\naccess to their web server because\n\n306\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.130\nobviously that can cause some\nkind of security vulnerability.\n\n307\n00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.340\nSo what you're doing is\nyou're hitting a device.\n\n308\n00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.824\nYou're hitting its IP address and it says,\nno, I'm not allowing you to the website.\n\n309\n00:15:52.824 --> 00:15:55.286\nI'm not gonna allow you\nto that web server.\n\n310\n00:15:55.286 --> 00:16:03.118\nHowever even though that's the IP\naddress if I type www.microsoft .com.\n\n311\n00:16:03.118 --> 00:16:04.702\nWell, now it connects.\n\n312\n00:16:04.702 --> 00:16:09.078\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] I was\ngonna say [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:16:09.078 --> 00:16:10.453\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now it connects.\n\n314\n00:16:10.453 --> 00:16:11.750\nAnd that's one of the great things.\n\n315\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.156\nAnd you can see this a lot.\n\n316\n00:16:13.156 --> 00:16:17.237\nI mean, you can do this to Google\nuse NS lookup and then space and\n\n317\n00:16:17.237 --> 00:16:20.220\nthen put whatever the www.website is.\n\n318\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.840\nGoogle is another one.\n\n319\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.160\nAnd that you might see\nmultiple IP addresses, right?\n\n320\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.768\nYou don't know where you might be going.\n\n321\n00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:26.686\nAnd thank goodness,\n\n322\n00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.660\nwe don't have to remember one of\nten different IP addresses alone.\n\n323\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.429\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you'd be hitting a proxy,\na load balancer, some sort of firewall.\n\n324\n00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:36.662\nAny kinda device that's basically\ntaking these requests looking for\n\n325\n00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.189\nthem in a specific way if\nthey're not coming that way.\n\n326\n00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:42.400\nYou'll get what Wes saw,\nwhich is hey, that's not a valid URL.\n\n327\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.560\nThat kinda thing can happen.\n\n328\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.760\nBut typically,\nthat's exactly what we would see.\n\n329\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.630\nIf it's just a standard straight up,\nI've got a web server out on the Internet.\n\n330\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.730\nI've got an IP address that's mapped\nto the name of that web server.\n\n331\n00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.340\nIf I typed in the IP address,\nit would work.\n\n332\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.880\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and\nthen thank goodness we have the service.\n\n333\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.060\nBecause if we didn't have the service,\nWes would have fell out of his\n\n334\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.570\nface right here on camera and we wouldn't\nhave been able to rebound from it.\n\n335\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.490\nSo it's great to have that.\n\n336\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.390\nNow, just when we mention the service,\n\n337\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.130\nwe gotta kinda talk a little bit about\nwhat's going on behind the scenes.\n\n338\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.090\nSo let's go a little bit farther\nwhen we look at DNS in general.\n\n339\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:17.570\nCuz when we talk about DNS,\n\n340\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.280\nwe do have a structure that I want\nyou to understand, all right?\n\n341\n00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.060\nAnd this structure is that\nhierarchy that we're talking about.\n\n342\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.893\nWhen your computer does something known\nas resolving names, all right, which\n\n343\n00:17:28.893 --> 00:17:33.666\nis taking that name and mapping it to\nan IP address, it goes through a process.\n\n344\n00:17:33.666 --> 00:17:37.702\nActually, backwards than what we read\nunless you're talking about some of\n\n345\n00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:41.119\nthe Semitic languages or\nArabic where you do read right to left.\n\n346\n00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.164\nSo that might be a little bit different.\n\n347\n00:17:43.164 --> 00:17:47.585\nBut here in English, if you will,\nwe read left to right.\n\n348\n00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:50.773\nWell, when names resolve,\nthey resolve from right to left.\n\n349\n00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:54.362\nAnd believe it or not,\nyou have what's known,\n\n350\n00:17:54.362 --> 00:17:58.710\neven though we don't type out,\nwww.microsoft.com.\n\n351\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.467\nTechnically, there is a dot just\nafter that last portion, right?\n\n352\n00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:04.894\nAnd that dot is implied though.\n\n353\n00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:08.286\nThe web browsers, the client web\nbrowser that's running on your machine,\n\n354\n00:18:08.286 --> 00:18:09.510\nit knows that it's there.\n\n355\n00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.890\nSo what is that dot?\n\n356\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.680\nWell, when we need to resolve a name,\nyou're gonna send a request to one of\n\n357\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.970\nthe configurations that we talked about to\na DHCP the IP address of that DNS server.\n\n358\n00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:25.370\nAnd your computer is gonna say hey,\nI need to know where www.microsoft.com is.\n\n359\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.135\nI need to know where www.google.com is or\nFacebook, all right?\n\n360\n00:18:30.135 --> 00:18:35.247\nAnd the computer that you're\nasking isn't in charge to put,\n\n361\n00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:38.730\ntechnically, that location, right?\n\n362\n00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.650\nUnless you're big company,\nyou might have your internal but\n\n363\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.660\nit's not in charge of that.\n\n364\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.390\nSo it says yeah, I don't know where\nthis is, I can't really help you out.\n\n365\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.530\nBut I can start you along the path that\ncan help you find that information and\n\n366\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.320\nit goes to that first part.\n\n367\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.020\nIt resolves the dot, it's called\na trailing dot that's at the end,\n\n368\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.490\nthat we don't even see.\n\n369\n00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.460\nThat dot is the highest part of the\nhierarchy that is known as the domain name\n\n370\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.220\nsystem and it's called root.\n\n371\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.160\nWe just call it root but\nit's actually one of, I think,\n\n372\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.370\n126 of them across the entire\nglobe that control DNS for us.\n\n373\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.720\nAnd that's the first part.\n\n374\n00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.900\nNow, what's root's job?\n\n375\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.390\nRoot's job isn't to tell you what an IP\naddress is, that's not what root does.\n\n376\n00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.360\nThat the root servers do is they say okay,\nlet me look at the portion\n\n377\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.520\njust to the left of myself, the dot,\nand let me see who are you asking for.\n\n378\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.061\nAll right, so we'll take the example\nthat it's microsoft.com,\n\n379\n00:19:34.061 --> 00:19:36.770\nfacebook.com, google.com.\n\n380\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.470\nWell, I see you're looking for dot com.\n\n381\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.210\nGuess what?\n\n382\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.820\nI have in my listing,\n\n383\n00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.510\nI'm in charge of what's known as\na top-level domain, TLD, all right?\n\n384\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.478\nThese are some of the examples.\n\n385\n00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:51.830\nThey're expanding every day just because\nof the boom of the Internet, right?\n\n386\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.190\nYou might have heard of\nthe dot-com bubble if you will.\n\n387\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.500\nIt isn't the only one we have out there,\nbut this is a short list, right,\n\n388\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.870\ncuz there's .mil for military if you will.\n\n389\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.556\nBut it says okay,\nI see that you're looking for .com.\n\n390\n00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:07.498\nI don't know who Microsoft is.\n\n391\n00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:12.230\nSo let me go ahead and I'll return you\nthe IP address of .com and that's we do.\n\n392\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.160\nWe move over to the next part of the\nhierarchy known as the top-level domain\n\n393\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.608\nand we go to one of the .com servers.\n\n394\n00:20:18.608 --> 00:20:25.280\nAnd the .com server says you're\nlooking for www.microsoft.com?\n\n395\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.848\nI don't know who WWW is.\n\n396\n00:20:26.848 --> 00:20:28.240\nI don't have a clue.\n\n397\n00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.667\nBut I do know who Microsoft is,\nbecause I .com and\n\n398\n00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:34.615\nthe authority over the Microsoft domain.\n\n399\n00:20:34.615 --> 00:20:36.603\nAt least,\npublicly out there on the Internet,\n\n400\n00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:39.250\nnot necessarily Microsoft themselves.\n\n401\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.470\nAnd it returns that answer\nto your computer, right, or\n\n402\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.970\nthe computer that's asking on your behalf,\nright?\n\n403\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.240\nSo what happens then?\n\n404\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.090\nWell, we're gonna go to\nMicrosoft's DNS servers.\n\n405\n00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.305\nAnd Microsoft is gonna say,\nI know who WWW is.\n\n406\n00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:56.463\nThat's sitting behind this IP address\nthat you can't get to by the IP address\n\n407\n00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:57.410\n[LAUGH] actually.\n\n408\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.306\nThat's sitting, I know where WWW is.\n\n409\n00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:05.440\nIn fact, here is the IP address for\nWWW and that is a fully resolved name.\n\n410\n00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.861\nIn fact, it's fully revolving.\n\n411\n00:21:06.861 --> 00:21:09.060\nWell, fully qualified domain name.\n\n412\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.477\nThat answer has returned from the DNS\nserver that you asked the question.\n\n413\n00:21:12.477 --> 00:21:16.715\nThe DNS server says here's your answer,\nhere's your IP address.\n\n414\n00:21:16.715 --> 00:21:19.687\nAnd that gets us to these\ndifferent locations, right?\n\n415\n00:21:19.687 --> 00:21:22.926\nThese are what are known as second-level\ndomains and I've some examples here.\n\n416\n00:21:22.926 --> 00:21:28.280\nAnd these are actually valid examples of\ndifferent, what are known as, SLDs, right?\n\n417\n00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.245\nTop-level domains,\nyou have these right here.\n\n418\n00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:34.950\nThese are the .com, .org,\n.tv, .net, .mil if you will.\n\n419\n00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.700\nAs well as second-level domains,\nlike .Microsoft, .Google, .Facebook.\n\n420\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.787\nIf you're in education, right, edu,\nyou're talking about Harvard, MIT,\n\n421\n00:21:43.787 --> 00:21:44.826\nBerkeley, right?\n\n422\n00:21:44.826 --> 00:21:47.510\nOr WordPress, Wikipedia, Mozilla.\n\n423\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.925\nThese are second-level domains.\n\n424\n00:21:48.925 --> 00:21:54.170\nAnd they control the servers that host the\nwebsites that you're trying to connect to.\n\n425\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:58.730\nAnd more importantly, they are the\nauthority over the computer, hostname,\n\n426\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.440\nthat you're trying to resolve.\n\n427\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.570\nSo that's the process,\nthe process of DNS, Domain Name System.\n\n428\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.285\nThese DNS servers hold records.\n\n429\n00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.275\nJust files is really all they are.\n\n430\n00:22:10.275 --> 00:22:14.083\nAnd kinda like Daniel made the analogy\nearlier of a phone book, right?\n\n431\n00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:17.712\nOr not a phone book but a listing within\nyour phone that takes that name and\n\n432\n00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.947\nit maps it to that phone number, right?\n\n433\n00:22:19.947 --> 00:22:23.047\nYour phone stores a little file\nin there that has those mappings.\n\n434\n00:22:23.047 --> 00:22:24.622\nWell, DNS servers do the same thing.\n\n435\n00:22:24.622 --> 00:22:27.187\nThey got a little file in there,\nit's just a little listing.\n\n436\n00:22:27.187 --> 00:22:31.917\nAnd that DNS server is gonna say yeah, I\nknow where WWW is, that's in my database.\n\n437\n00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:35.283\nHere's the IP address,\nyou can find it, go look here.\n\n438\n00:22:35.283 --> 00:22:38.053\nAnd we work through this\nprocess every time.\n\n439\n00:22:38.053 --> 00:22:40.326\nNow, I know we got a few more minutes,\nwe're kind of running up on time here.\n\n440\n00:22:40.326 --> 00:22:42.998\nBut there's one last thing I wanna\ntalk a little bit about DNS on,\n\n441\n00:22:42.998 --> 00:22:45.065\nbecause that's something\nknown as DNS caching.\n\n442\n00:22:45.065 --> 00:22:47.313\nAll right, when we talk about DNS caching,\n\n443\n00:22:47.313 --> 00:22:51.303\nwhat we're talking about is\nholding a piece of information\n\n444\n00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:55.050\nto speed up the process next time\nwe need to use that service, right?\n\n445\n00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.689\nHave you ever had somebody ask you\na question and then a few minutes later or\n\n446\n00:22:58.689 --> 00:23:01.154\na week later,\nthey ask you the same question, and\n\n447\n00:23:01.154 --> 00:23:04.995\nthen they ask you the same question, and\nthen they ask you the same question?\n\n448\n00:23:04.995 --> 00:23:07.395\nAnd how long does it take you before\nyou tell them, just write it down?\n\n449\n00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:09.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna tell you anymore,\n\n450\n00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.000\nwrite it down, all right?\n\n451\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.180\nWell, that's kinda what DNS caching does.\n\n452\n00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.210\nEvery one of your systems\nhave a DNS cache.\n\n453\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.070\nIn fact, I could kinda show you\nthat here on our Windows machine.\n\n454\n00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.890\nNow, guys, we're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about some of these commands coming\n\n455\n00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.820\nup in troubleshooting but\nwe kinda wanna just show you briefly here.\n\n456\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.730\nSo if I wanna see what is the local cache,\nall right, have I looked?\n\n457\n00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.990\nAnd you guys can see we looked for\nMicrosoft earlier.\n\n458\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.160\nHave I looked for names out there already?\n\n459\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.000\nBecause if I have,\nI could have store them locally and\n\n460\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.100\nI don't have to ask that question\nagain on the DNS service, right?\n\n461\n00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.171\nI can just say I wrote that answer down.\n\n462\n00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:45.340\nI don't have to ask anybody.\n\n463\n00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.910\nI don't have to annoy the DNS server,\nright?\n\n464\n00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.590\nSo let's go ahead and show you.\n\n465\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.290\nipconfig, inside of Windows,\nthat's Internet Protocol Configuration.\n\n466\n00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:57.020\nIt shows you the TCP/IP properties of\nthe network adapter within your machines.\n\n467\n00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.241\nSo when you run, in fact,\nlet me go ahead and clear the screen.\n\n468\n00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:02.341\nGet this up to the top, make it\na little easier for you guys to see.\n\n469\n00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:06.225\nYou can run ipconfig/,\nall one word displayDNS,\n\n470\n00:24:06.225 --> 00:24:09.483\nand when you run that, here's the cache.\n\n471\n00:24:09.483 --> 00:24:14.690\nThis is the local cache, if you will,\nof the questions you've asked.\n\n472\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.940\nNow, I haven't use the web browser on\nthis machine, so you might say, well,\n\n473\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.080\nwait a second, Wes.\n\n474\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.520\nIf you haven't browsed the web on there,\nwhy are there records there?\n\n475\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.820\nWell, web browsers aren't\nthe only thing that use DNS.\n\n476\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.450\nIn this case, what's going on is this\nmachine is running a Windows update.\n\n477\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.710\nWell guess what?\n\n478\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.400\nIt's gonna use a name, and\nit doesn't know the IP address, so\n\n479\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.590\nguess what my computer does?\n\n480\n00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.238\nIt checks with a DNS server and it says,\nhey, Windows, or hey, Microsoft,\n\n481\n00:24:39.238 --> 00:24:40.938\nI need to find the updates, right?\n\n482\n00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:44.814\nAnd the updates actually take you out to\nanother company that holds that closer to\n\n483\n00:24:44.814 --> 00:24:48.080\nyou so it's more efficient,\nand it resolves those names.\n\n484\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.300\nAll right, they're called records.\n\n485\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.170\nBasically taking a name and mapping it to\nan IP address, is stored in a database,\n\n486\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.810\nthat database is an individual record,\nright?\n\n487\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.460\nAnd then we store it locally.\n\n488\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.563\nSo the next time in this case,\nWindows needs to run its local updates,\n\n489\n00:25:00.563 --> 00:25:02.626\nit doesn't have to go\nback to the DNS process.\n\n490\n00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:04.920\nIt can say,\nI already got that information.\n\n491\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.290\nLet me go ahead, I've got the mapping,\nI can talk right to the IP address,\n\n492\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.390\nif you will, of that machine.\n\n493\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.040\nIn fact, we can kinda give\nyou an example here, too.\n\n494\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.113\nSo this is probably, the akadns.\n\n495\n00:25:17.113 --> 00:25:22.265\nWell, that's easy, I think it's Akamai,\nthey're a content distribution network.\n\n496\n00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:25.794\nThey actually store your updates local, so\nyou don't have to go all the way across\n\n497\n00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:28.470\nthe internet over to Redmond and\nthen pull your updates back.\n\n498\n00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.839\nIt's closer to you, all right?\n\n499\n00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:33.889\nSo that's an example of basically\nwhere you can see the local\n\n500\n00:25:33.889 --> 00:25:36.730\nresolver cache as it's called.\n\n501\n00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:41.350\nIn DNS in general, this is what\nyou're gonna go through as well.\n\n502\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.360\nDan, I'm gonna pull a Columbo here on you,\njust cuz there's just one more thing.\n\n503\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.309\nAnd again, I told you that-\n&gt;&gt; Just one more thing.\n\n504\n00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:48.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just one more thing.\n\n505\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.850\nThere is one more thing that I have\nto talk about that I didn't mention.\n\n506\n00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.840\nI mentioned a DHCP server, and\n\n507\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.820\nright, I said that we get an IP\naddress through a DHCP server.\n\n508\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.233\nWell what happens if\nthe DHCP server fails?\n\n509\n00:26:01.233 --> 00:26:04.310\nWell you don't get an IP address, right?\n\n510\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.416\nWell Windows has built into it\na technology that still allows you to\n\n511\n00:26:08.416 --> 00:26:12.524\nmaintain some kind of relative\ncommunication with the network and\n\n512\n00:26:12.524 --> 00:26:15.626\nthat's one last thing that\nwe want to talk about.\n\n513\n00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:20.347\nIt really goes in line when you talk\nabout public and private IP addresses and\n\n514\n00:26:20.347 --> 00:26:22.579\nthat's something known as APIPA.\n\n515\n00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:26.909\nAPIPA stands for\nthe Automatic Private IP Address, and\n\n516\n00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:32.100\nI've also heard it called\nAutomatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n517\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:37.090\nAnd this is a situation where let's\nsay my rental car, all right,\n\n518\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.960\nthe lease is expired.\n\n519\n00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.280\nI'm standing on the side of the road and\nI need a rental car, right?\n\n520\n00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.790\nBut I don't have access\nto a rental car agency.\n\n521\n00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.793\nSo what do I do?\n\n522\n00:26:44.793 --> 00:26:46.247\nLet's say I call a cab, right?\n\n523\n00:26:46.247 --> 00:26:47.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wes steals a car.\n\n524\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.287\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n525\n00:26:49.287 --> 00:26:50.736\n&gt;&gt; Throws a brick through a windshield.\n\n526\n00:26:50.736 --> 00:26:54.657\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say yeah, then we've\ngot some GTA going on right here.\n\n527\n00:26:54.657 --> 00:26:55.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n528\n00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.450\n&gt;&gt; Here comes Wes if he can get away.\n\n529\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:03.430\nSo they do have a technology that's kind\nof like, it isn't really a one size fits\n\n530\n00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.551\nall type solution, it's kind of\nlike a fall back on, if you will.\n\n531\n00:27:07.551 --> 00:27:11.638\nAnd what we mean by Automatic Private IP\nAddressing, if my computer calls out to\n\n532\n00:27:11.638 --> 00:27:15.729\nthe network and it says, hey, I need\nan IP address out there, anybody got one?\n\n533\n00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:16.964\nAnd it hears crickets.\n\n534\n00:27:16.964 --> 00:27:21.236\nWell, it can actually automatically assign\nits own IP address and that's why I said\n\n535\n00:27:21.236 --> 00:27:24.803\nit, when we started talking about dynamic,\nbe very careful on that.\n\n536\n00:27:24.803 --> 00:27:27.295\nDynamic just means it can change,\nit doesn't mean it's automatic,\n\n537\n00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:29.375\nthere's a certain level of\nconfiguration you have to do.\n\n538\n00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:32.810\nI don't have to do anything for\nan IP address here, right?\n\n539\n00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.570\nAutomatic Private IP Addressing\nis an example\n\n540\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.240\nof what they call a zero\nconfiguration technology.\n\n541\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.550\nKinda like plug and\nplay is, that zero config.\n\n542\n00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.410\nI plug it in and it goes to work.\n\n543\n00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.910\nThis does that too.\n\n544\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.730\nI want you to know that it\nhas a specific format though\n\n545\n00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.720\nbecause not only knowing the concept,\n\n546\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.350\nthey could ask you on the exam,\nwhat type of address is this, all right?\n\n547\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.950\nAnd if you look here at\nthe little diagram, I have,\n\n548\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.710\nnotice that there's a 169.254,\nwhy did I stop there?\n\n549\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.870\n&gt;&gt; That's a dead give away\nthat that's an APIPA address.\n\n550\n00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:06.680\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely, because those\nare the only two octets we care about.\n\n551\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.649\nThere's actually a wider range\nhere of APIPA addresses,\n\n552\n00:28:10.649 --> 00:28:13.403\nbut on the exam, in the RFC, request for\n\n553\n00:28:13.403 --> 00:28:17.786\ncomment specification,\nthey say it has to be 169.254.\n\n554\n00:28:17.786 --> 00:28:22.346\nYour computer, zero config,\nwill automatically just generate,\n\n555\n00:28:22.346 --> 00:28:25.070\nif you will, the last two octets.\n\n556\n00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.541\nIf there's ever a conflict, the other\ncomputer that has that same APIPA address,\n\n557\n00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:33.200\nit'll call out to the network and say,\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's mine.\n\n558\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.290\nAnd your computer's saying, oops, my bad.\n\n559\n00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.264\nLet me regenerate the last two octets,\nuntil it comes up with a unique one.\n\n560\n00:28:38.264 --> 00:28:43.300\nA lot of the times you have, gosh,\n16 bits, you have 65,535 possibilities.\n\n561\n00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.190\nIt can happen.\n\n562\n00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.020\nYou never say never in computing.\n\n563\n00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.470\nBut it really is kinda highly unlikely,\nespecially in smaller networks.\n\n564\n00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.330\nNow that's an IPv4 address.\n\n565\n00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.776\nThere is one last one that\nyou could also get, and\n\n566\n00:28:54.776 --> 00:28:56.693\nthat is something I can show you here.\n\n567\n00:28:56.693 --> 00:29:00.970\nGoing down to our\nInternet Protocol Configuration Utility,\n\n568\n00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:05.492\nif I type cmd, Charlie Mike Delta,\nin our search, run line, and\n\n569\n00:29:05.492 --> 00:29:08.223\nbring back up the Command Prompt here.\n\n570\n00:29:08.223 --> 00:29:12.723\nOne of the things you'll notice\nhere is that you also have,\n\n571\n00:29:12.723 --> 00:29:17.493\nif I do an ipconfig /all, and\nI look at all of the information,\n\n572\n00:29:17.493 --> 00:29:20.110\nlet's see if I can find it in here.\n\n573\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.600\nYes, yes,\nI wanted to show you guys this last one.\n\n574\n00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.668\nIPv6 has an automatic type of address.\n\n575\n00:29:26.668 --> 00:29:29.930\nRemember I told you you can\nuse multiple IP addresses?\n\n576\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:35.277\nAnd that is what's known as the link-local\naddress and it starts out with a prefix\n\n577\n00:29:35.277 --> 00:29:41.263\nof fe80, just like APIPA has a 169.254,\nI don't care what the last part of it is.\n\n578\n00:29:41.263 --> 00:29:43.201\nKnow that on the exam as well,\n\n579\n00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:46.858\nthat an fe80 is kinda like\nan APIPA address for IPv6.\n\n580\n00:29:46.858 --> 00:29:50.858\nBut your computer can generate it and\nthen it can communicate on an IPv6 based\n\n581\n00:29:50.858 --> 00:29:53.330\nnetwork without you\ndoing any configuration.\n\n582\n00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.062\nIt's another one of those\nzero config technologies.\n\n583\n00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:59.722\nSo a couple of last little stray shoelaces\nwe wanted to tie off, Dan, just so we\n\n584\n00:29:59.722 --> 00:30:03.667\nare thorough on our objectives and you'll\nbe a little bit more prepared on the exam.\n\n585\n00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:06.238\nNot only for the objectives,\nthese are important concepts,\n\n586\n00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:08.464\nespecially when it comes\ninto troubleshooting, but\n\n587\n00:30:08.464 --> 00:30:10.730\nwe're going to save that one for\nanother episode.\n\n588\n00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Well there's definitely a lot\nof going-ons when it comes to DNS.\n\n589\n00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.595\nIt's doing a lot of stuff for us, but it's\nan extreme help to us as humans because of\n\n590\n00:30:18.595 --> 00:30:23.305\nthat whole, I don't remember IP addresses\nvery well, but I do remember names.\n\n591\n00:30:23.305 --> 00:30:24.953\nThey stick in my mind for\nsome strange reason.\n\n592\n00:30:24.953 --> 00:30:28.335\nSo that kinda does that translation for\nus and it's\n\n593\n00:30:28.335 --> 00:30:32.495\na good thing it's around otherwise really\nnetworking would not be where it's at.\n\n594\n00:30:32.495 --> 00:30:36.195\nAnd I did just for\nWes's good pleasure here,\n\n595\n00:30:36.195 --> 00:30:39.905\nI did try the Facebook nslookup trick and\nit worked fine.\n\n596\n00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:42.650\nSo if you guys want to try that\nyourselves, just do an nslookup for\n\n597\n00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.280\nFacebook, take that IP address,\n\n598\n00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.790\nslap it in your browser and\nit will take you to Facebook.\n\n599\n00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.810\nSo, very cool stuff.\n\n600\n00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.373\nWes, thanks for joining us today and\nteaching us about DNS.\n\n601\n00:30:50.373 --> 00:30:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n602\n00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.019\n&gt;&gt; It's a very lengthy topic that we\nbarely even scratched the surface on, but\n\n603\n00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:57.050\nwe are definitely done with TCP/IP.\n\n604\n00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.450\nWe appreciate your walk through on that.\n\n605\n00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.486\nThank you all for watching,\nhopefully you've enjoyed this episode and\n\n606\n00:31:02.486 --> 00:31:05.534\nyou got a lot out of our

00:00:08.192\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:10.880\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.296\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.362\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:17.658\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:21.550\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with more of our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.718\nAnd joining us yet\nagain in the studio, you know him.\n\n10\n00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:27.280\nThe man, the myth, the legend,\nthat is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.158\nWes, we're glad to have you.\n\n12\n00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:29.039\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.854\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:30.878\nThanks for lifting the bar.\n\n15\n00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:33.152\nHope that you'll stick around and help\nme hold that thing up, that's for sure.\n\n16\n00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:33.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n17\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.494\nwe're gonna be looking at more of\nour network communications and\n\n18\n00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.650\nnetworking technologies.\n\n19\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.927\nAnd specifically what we're gonna be\ntalking about in this episode are ports\n\n20\n00:00:41.927 --> 00:00:43.518\nand protocols, all right?\n\n21\n00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:46.713\nAnd when I say ports,\nI'm not talking about starboard versus,\n\n22\n00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.968\nwhat's the other one?\n\n23\n00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, port-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, portside.\n\n24\n00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:52.870\n&gt;&gt; I guess it shows you that I've\nnever really been on a boat, right?\n\n25\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.710\n&gt;&gt; You old sailor, you.\n[LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n27\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.511\nSo we're gonnatalk about something that\napparently, hopefully I do know about,\n\n28\n00:00:58.511 --> 00:00:59.046\nunlike boats.\n\n29\n00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:02.890\nSo we're gonna talk about ports and\nprotocols, so let's go ahead.\n\n30\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.979\nFirst of all, let's talk about\nwhat a protocol is, right?\n\n31\n00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.295\nWhen we talk about a protocol,\nwe have network communications.\n\n32\n00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:10.336\nAnd when it comes to\nnetwork communications,\n\n33\n00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.651\nwe have a set of rules that\nwe have to follow, right?\n\n34\n00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:17.295\nAnd if you have different protocols for\nthe different types of communications,\n\n35\n00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:21.403\ndifferent types of applications that\nneed to send their data, right?\n\n36\n00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:26.199\nAnd it is important to understand that\nif you are sending a certain type of\n\n37\n00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:30.692\ndata over a network that you are using\nthe same protocol on each end.\n\n38\n00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:32.920\nNow we also have ports,\nand what is a port for us?\n\n39\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.858\nBut a port is what they\ncall a logical identifier.\n\n40\n00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:40.196\nBasically, it identifies the endpoint\nof a connection and really identifies\n\n41\n00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:44.480\nthe service or the protocol, if you will,\nthat the port is associated with.\n\n42\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.870\nSo there are a few different ports\nthat we wanna make you aware of.\n\n43\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.030\nThey have a few different ranges.\n\n44\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.190\nAnd when we talk about ports,\nthere are a set of standards, if you will,\n\n45\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.980\nthat a international standards\nbody set in place, INA.\n\n46\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.440\nIt started way back in the 70s,\nlate 70s, if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.360\nThat's the International\nAssigned Numbers Authority.\n\n48\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.580\nThey've kind of dissolved,\n\n49\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.890\neven though their name is littered all\nover the documentations and the standards.\n\n50\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.440\nI think it's back in 2003ish that\nthe DOD contracts were basically run up.\n\n51\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.060\nAnd a new body, if you will,\nis doing the same and that's called ICANN.\n\n52\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.080\nThey're the Internet Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers.\n\n53\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530\nThey help to oversee,\n\n54\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.980\nnot only things like these port\ncommunications, network communications,\n\n55\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.892\nbut even what we talk about in other\nepisodes like IP address ranges.\n\n56\n00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:40.134\nSo do know that there are a certain\nfew different ranges of ports.\n\n57\n00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:41.542\nWe have what are known\nas well-known ports.\n\n58\n00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.768\nWell-known ports are common ports,\nif you will.\n\n59\n00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:48.110\nTypically identify all the common services\nthat we use when we communicate over\n\n60\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.910\nwhat's known as a TCP/IP based network,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.980\nThat's the Transmission Control\nProtocol/nternet Protocol.\n\n62\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.566\nIt's a family or a suite of protocols that\nallow us to communicate across the web.\n\n63\n00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:04.654\nNow, in that well-known port range,\nthe ports that we have are zero,\n\n64\n00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:11.364\nyes, zero always counts in computing,\nkeep that in mind, zero to 1023.\n\n65\n00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:13.994\nNow outside of zero to 1023,\nwe have 1024 to 49151, right?\n\n66\n00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:18.580\nThat's really 49,151 and those\nare what's known as registered ports.\n\n67\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.260\nNow registered ports aren't necessarily\njust completely overseen by manufacturers.\n\n68\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.872\nBut this allows software manufacturers\nwho want to use a certain port,\n\n69\n00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:30.111\nthey can use these ports\nwithin that range.\n\n70\n00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:34.842\nThen, step outside of that,\nwe have 49,152 to 65,535.\n\n71\n00:03:34.842 --> 00:03:38.431\nAnd these are what are known as dynamic\nports or sometimes called private ports.\n\n72\n00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:40.960\nAnd the reason we call them\ndynamic is because your computers,\n\n73\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.678\nyour operating systems, your software,\n\n74\n00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:45.130\nthey'll assign these ports at\nthe time that they need them.\n\n75\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.788\nAnd when they don't need them anymore,\n\n76\n00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:49.384\nthey'll go back into a pool that\nthey can reuse later, right?\n\n77\n00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:53.975\nBut there's no specific service associated\nwith that high level port, all right?\n\n78\n00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:58.980\nNow, knowing those port ranges\nis important on the exam.\n\n79\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.510\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's talk about protocols that we have.\n\n80\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.650\nDifferent types of communications that\ncommunicate across these networks and\n\n81\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.600\nthe ports that are associated with them.\n\n82\n00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.590\nOne of the very first ones I wanna talk\nabout is actually a couple in the same\n\n83\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.260\ndiagram here.\n\n84\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.153\nI've got a little diagram here, and\n\n85\n00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:14.666\nwe have a necessity to do remote logons,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:17.075\nRemote logon is when I'm\nsitting at my computer, or\n\n87\n00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:19.977\nDan's sitting at his computer,\nand we connect, let's say,\n\n88\n00:04:19.977 --> 00:04:22.745\nover the network into a connectivity\ndevice in the server.\n\n89\n00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.530\nAnd we connect to this powerful\ncomputer known as a server.\n\n90\n00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.160\nAnd we want to manage it and\n\n91\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.471\nnot have to be in the same physical\nlocation of that machine, right?\n\n92\n00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:36.000\nIt makes it very, very easy for\nthings like administration, right?\n\n93\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.668\nI don't have to be in the same physical\nlocation of the device that I'm gonna be\n\n94\n00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:40.794\nconfiguring, right?\n\n95\n00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:44.945\nUnlike sitting down at a PC and\nworking with your PC or Mac or\n\n96\n00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:46.567\na Linux based system.\n\n97\n00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:52.210\nNow in the earlier days of communications,\nwe'll go back to the ARPANET, right?\n\n98\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.087\nThat's before we have what\nthe Internet would later be.\n\n99\n00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:00.720\nBasically brought out\nof the earlier ARPANET.\n\n100\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.631\n&gt;&gt; It was like the proto Internet.\n\n101\n00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:05.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great way to put it,\nit's the advanced research project agency.\n\n102\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.640\nSo what makes up our Internet today is\nlargely started by a few universities and\n\n103\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.420\nour Department of Defense\nhere in the United States.\n\n104\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.200\nNow in those days, we had five or\nsix entities [LAUGH] that were really\n\n105\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.730\nconnected to that network, and then they\nstarted adding more, and more, and more.\n\n106\n00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.573\nBut keep in mind that, in those early\ndays, we didn't have the major concern for\n\n107\n00:05:25.573 --> 00:05:27.865\ndata privacy that that we have today.\n\n108\n00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:31.552\nRight now, we have so many people\nattached to public networks, and\n\n109\n00:05:31.552 --> 00:05:32.975\nanybody can jump on them,\n\n110\n00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:37.390\nthat it was kinda difficult to connect\nto those networks in the earlier days.\n\n111\n00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.695\nLike I said, it would be schools,\nit'd be military institutions, so\n\n112\n00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:43.579\nprivacy wasn't a major deal.\n\n113\n00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:47.176\nSo when I would make a remote logon\nto connect to either a terminal,\n\n114\n00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:50.387\nif you will, connect it to\na mainframe at a big computer, or\n\n115\n00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:54.370\nif we were making a connection again,\nessentially, to another device,\n\n116\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.190\neverything can go across the network\nin what's known as plaintext.\n\n117\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.139\nNow what does plaintext mean?\n\n118\n00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.148\nBut that means the fact that if\nsomebody's out on that network,\n\n119\n00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:06.106\nthere are software programs out there that\ncan actually scrape that information and\n\n120\n00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:07.456\nthrow it into your display.\n\n121\n00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:10.710\nAnd show you what the information\nis inside of the text, right?\n\n122\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.060\nThat's called plaintext,\nbecause you can read it.\n\n123\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.900\nNow that doesn't provide\na confidentiality.\n\n124\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.350\nAnd the first protocol, if we go back\nto our slide here, is called Telnet.\n\n125\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.990\nTelnet is a terminal emulation software\nthat said telecommunication networking,\n\n126\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.180\nI think it's what is short for.\n\n127\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.376\nBut it is a plaintext communication,\n\n128\n00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:32.540\nit allows me to remotely\nlog on to another device.\n\n129\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.540\nAgain, I don't have to be in\nthe same physical location.\n\n130\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.161\nIn fact, if some of you guys are aware\nof the co-founder of Apple out there,\n\n131\n00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:40.183\nSteve Wozniak.\n\n132\n00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:40.683\nWozniak?\n&gt;&gt; Wozniak.\n\n133\n00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:42.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] thank you, the Woz,\n\n134\n00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:45.699\nI always remember it as the Woz.\nHe used to talk about when he was at\n\n135\n00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.687\nuniversity, he used to have fun logging\nonto ARPANET back in those days and\n\n136\n00:06:49.687 --> 00:06:54.183\nplaying solitaire from California all the\nway over to a computer that was, I think,\n\n137\n00:06:54.183 --> 00:06:56.463\nit's somewhere out there, Berg Harbor,\n\n138\n00:06:56.463 --> 00:06:59.576\nor something like that.\nYou notice the great\n\n139\n00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.320\nlong distances.\nAnd\n\n140\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.110\nin those days, it was just fine.\nWe didn't care about the privacy\n\n141\n00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.475\nwe do today.\n\n142\n00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:08.670\nPlaintext communications,\nwhen you talk about configuring and\n\n143\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.682\nconnecting to remote devices could\nlead to a security vulnerability.\n\n144\n00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:16.293\nAnd that's what gave rise to the next\nprotocol I'd like to talk about and\n\n145\n00:07:16.293 --> 00:07:17.425\nthat's known as SSH.\n\n146\n00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:20.484\nSSH allows you to also\nperform a remote logon so\n\n147\n00:07:20.484 --> 00:07:23.710\nthat you can configure\nyour different devices.\n\n148\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.947\nYou can connect to these devices,\nutilize them again.\n\n149\n00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.338\nAnd don't have to be in that\nsame physical location.\n\n150\n00:07:29.338 --> 00:07:35.340\nNow there's a big difference between\nsecure shell as opposed to Telnet.\n\n151\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.430\nTelnet, being a plaintext communication,\nyou can grab that information and\n\n152\n00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.450\npotentially see what\nis in the data itself.\n\n153\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.820\nSecure Shell uses encryption.\n\n154\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.962\nIt takes that plaintext that\nwe've talked about, and\n\n155\n00:07:47.962 --> 00:07:52.141\nit uses encryption algorithms to\nprovide what's known as cipher text.\n\n156\n00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:56.121\nAll right, cipher text is when\nyou have scrambled data that only\n\n157\n00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.099\nthe source where I'm logging into And\nthe device, if you will,\n\n158\n00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:05.708\nthe destination that I'm remotely logging\non to, understand the communication.\n\n159\n00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:08.790\nIt means, let's say Dan is communicating,\nlet's say,\n\n160\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.890\nwith one of the Cisco switches\ninside of our server closet.\n\n161\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.317\nI put my black hat on and I'm gonna decide\nto attack the network and he's using SSH,\n\n162\n00:08:17.317 --> 00:08:18.214\nI can't reach.\n\n163\n00:08:18.214 --> 00:08:20.325\nI can grab that information but\nwhen I look at it,\n\n164\n00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:22.990\nit's gonna look like a bunch\nof scrambled garbage, right?\n\n165\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.770\nI won't be able to see the information,\nand\n\n166\n00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.370\nthat's one of the benefits of using SSH.\n\n167\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.600\nWhen we configure devices from a remote\nlocation, you wanna make sure that people\n\n168\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.010\ndon't have access to that information,\ncuz again, it can be used for war attacks.\n\n169\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.800\n&gt;&gt; So sensitive information, we use SSH.\n\n170\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.340\nStuff that doesn't really matter,\nyou can use Telnet as a standard.\n\n171\n00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.841\nWe do see Telnet still\nrunning around out there.\n\n172\n00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:51.653\nActually, if you wanna play with it, you\ncan open up a terminal that has Telnet or\n\n173\n00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:56.910\na Telnet client and you can connect\nto rainmaker.wunderground.com.\n\n174\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.009\nAnd that's the weather underground,\nW-U-N-D-E-R ground, like that.\n\n175\n00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:03.865\nAnd you can connect, and\nyou'll see it, and it'll work and\n\n176\n00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:06.678\ngive you the local weather,\njust ask you for your zip code.\n\n177\n00:09:06.678 --> 00:09:07.509\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for giving me homework.\n\n178\n00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:09.989\nNow I'm gonna play a little bit of Telnet.\n\n179\n00:09:09.989 --> 00:09:10.781\nThat's great to know.\n\n180\n00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:11.508\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's still here.\n\n181\n00:09:11.508 --> 00:09:13.132\n&gt;&gt; And it gives you guys access to it so\n\n182\n00:09:13.132 --> 00:09:15.650\nyou can kind of see what\nthe software is doing.\n\n183\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.190\nNow we mentioned ports, and\nI didn't mention it, right?\n\n184\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.510\nLet's talk about what we identify the\ntraffic as being a Telnet communication.\n\n185\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.939\nTelnet connects over port 23.\n\n186\n00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:28.850\nSo if I am making a connection,\n\n187\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.778\nmy computer is going to send an outbound\nfrom me to that device, a communication\n\n188\n00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:38.942\nthat will have the network address of the\ndevice that I'm sending information to.\n\n189\n00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:42.337\nAnd a port number associated with\nit that identifies the service or\n\n190\n00:09:42.337 --> 00:09:44.900\nthe protocol that's running, it's port 23.\n\n191\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.360\nNow it's kinda interesting\nbecause SSH is actually port 22.\n\n192\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.213\nSo do know that for the exam,\nsecure shell, right,\n\n193\n00:09:51.213 --> 00:09:55.440\nencrypted ciphertext information,\nkeeping it confidential is port 22.\n\n194\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.540\nPlain text, you might what to steer away\nfrom it, Telnet is gonna be port 23.\n\n195\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.920\nThat's a couple of the protocols\nthat we need to talk about.\n\n196\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.410\nNow let's go ahead and go back in time.\n\n197\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.210\nLet's talk about another oldie but\ngoodie, right?\n\n198\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.010\nAnd that's something known as FTP.\n\n199\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.390\nFTP has been around for a very long\ntime and it is a great protocol.\n\n200\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.535\nIt is called the File Transfer Protocol.\n\n201\n00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:22.990\nWhen I say it's a great protocol, one of\nthe things that makes it great is it's\n\n202\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.514\nhighly optimized for large,\nlarge file transfers, right?\n\n203\n00:10:26.514 --> 00:10:29.359\nBut it has a problem,\nit has an inherent flaw as well.\n\n204\n00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:33.105\nAnd when I say flaw, it's because\nat the time that it was designed,\n\n205\n00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:37.378\nit goes all the way back to the early days\nas well as Arbornet because it's also\n\n206\n00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:39.374\na clear text protocol, all right?\n\n207\n00:10:39.374 --> 00:10:41.021\nWhen I say clear text protocol,\n\n208\n00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:43.949\nagain, that means if I connect\nto an FTP server, right?\n\n209\n00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:46.987\nA computer out there that's\nrunning that protocol, and\n\n210\n00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:49.718\nwe're communicating between\nmy computer and it.\n\n211\n00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:53.693\nThat means that, just like we\nsaid with the SSH versus Telnet,\n\n212\n00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:56.918\nif somebody is out there\nwith a piece of software and\n\n213\n00:10:56.918 --> 00:11:01.510\ncan grab and store that information,\nthey can view what you're doing.\n\n214\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.842\nThey know they can potentially have\naccess to all the information.\n\n215\n00:11:04.842 --> 00:11:09.135\nSo FTP is a File Transfer Protocol,\nallows you to connect over the network to\n\n216\n00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:14.640\nanother computer, and again, transfer\nfiles or upload files over the network.\n\n217\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.950\nNow I also want you to know that\nit has a port as well, too.\n\n218\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:18.490\nAll right, now,\n\n219\n00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.730\nthis is kind of interesting because\nit's actually got a couple of ports.\n\n220\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.820\nLet's go ahead and\nI got a little example here of FTP.\n\n221\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.350\nSo if I'm connecting to a computer\nthat's storing files over FTP,\n\n222\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.520\nwe've got two different ports.\n\n223\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.552\nWe've got ports that send and\nreceive data.\n\n224\n00:11:33.552 --> 00:11:37.992\nWe have also got ports that send and\nreceive commands or controls, right?\n\n225\n00:11:37.992 --> 00:11:44.444\nWhen you use FTP, you've got to know a\nlittle bit about the text based interface.\n\n226\n00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:48.036\nBy a text based interface, I mean, for\ninstance, things like your commands that\n\n227\n00:11:48.036 --> 00:11:51.750\nyou would enter or you can have software\nthat allows you to connect, too.\n\n228\n00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.120\nBut the controls that say,\n\n229\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.380\nI wanna download that file,\nthey go over a separate port, all right?\n\n230\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.240\nSo we're talking about two ports.\n\n231\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.480\nPort 20 is what you're\ngonna send your command.\n\n232\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.230\nWhen you say, hey, computer,\nI need to retrieve that file, or\n\n233\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.730\ncomputer, I need to send that file,\nthat's gonna be port 20.\n\n234\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.970\nNow when the file's delivered or\nsent, it's gonna be over port 21.\n\n235\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.460\nNow one of the things I would\nremember on the exam is, Dan and\n\n236\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.090\nI have been talking about\nthis entire series,\n\n237\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.710\nthe fact that there are memorization\ntechniques that you can use.\n\n238\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.090\nWe talked about flash cards.\n\n239\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.580\nHere's how I remembered it way back when\nI took my first A+, data over commands.\n\n240\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.440\nData is important.\n\n241\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.610\nData over commands.\n\n242\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.969\n20 is controls, data sits over it, 21.\n\n243\n00:12:29.969 --> 00:12:33.952\nAll right, so know that the file\ntransfer protocol, again, also,\n\n244\n00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:38.208\nis a clear text communication in the fact\nthat if an attacker is out there,\n\n245\n00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:42.770\nlooks at that information, they could\npotentially read what you're doing.\n\n246\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:48.000\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about FTP, SSH, and Telnet.\n\n247\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.106\nNow, moving down our list, we have\na few more that we have to talk about.\n\n248\n00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:53.666\nAnd I know, Dan,\nI'm kinda jumping around here on our list.\n\n249\n00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:56.290\nThat's because they mentioned some\nof these email protocols, right, but\n\n250\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.055\nthey scatter them out all\nthrough the objectives.\n\n251\n00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:00.908\nSo what I'm gonna do here, make a little\nbit more efficient for you and I and\n\n252\n00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:03.545\nyou the viewers out there is we're\ngonna bundle them all together.\n\n253\n00:13:03.545 --> 00:13:07.520\nLet's make it a little bit easier\nwhen it comes to talking about email.\n\n254\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.110\nSo what is email, right?\n\n255\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.820\nEmail is just,\n\n256\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.245\nwell, we say it so often today that\nwe kind of maybe take it for granted.\n\n257\n00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:16.680\nIt's electronic mail delivery,\nelectronic mail, right?\n\n258\n00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.480\nThat's where we get the term email.\n\n259\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.570\nNow email has used a few different\nseries of rules of communication,\n\n260\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.170\nand by that I mean, protocols.\n\n261\n00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.720\nAnd it depends on what is\nhappening on the email or\n\n262\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.400\nwhich direction is it going as\nto which one you're gonna use.\n\n263\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:39.793\nThe first one is something known as\nthe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP.\n\n264\n00:13:39.793 --> 00:13:43.487\nNow I got a little diagram here,\nkinda show you what's going on with SMTP.\n\n265\n00:13:43.487 --> 00:13:47.930\nI want you to pay attention to\nthe direction of the email, right?\n\n266\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:53.720\nSo if I'm on my computer and\nI have to send email outbound,\n\n267\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.790\nI'm gonna use SMTP,\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol.\n\n268\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.041\nNow also understand that it has\na specific port that it uses, and, well,\n\n269\n00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.219\nthat's port 25.\n\n270\n00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.508\nAll right, so when you're configuring\nthings like your email clients, right?\n\n271\n00:14:07.508 --> 00:14:10.358\nEmail clients, guys,\njargon aside, that's a little bit\n\n272\n00:14:10.358 --> 00:14:14.246\nof software that runs on the computer\nthat actually sends the email out, right?\n\n273\n00:14:14.246 --> 00:14:16.285\nIt means that it's gonna send it out with,\n\n274\n00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:20.150\nagain, some addressing information so\nit knows where to go across the network.\n\n275\n00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.454\nAnd it's gonna be also\nattached port 25 to the end.\n\n276\n00:14:23.454 --> 00:14:27.787\nAnd that's important especially when you\ntalk about basic configurations of emails\n\n277\n00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:31.590\nbecause you want that information\nto get to the destination, right?\n\n278\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.740\nSo remember, port 25.\n\n279\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.623\nNow we've got some other ones,\n\n280\n00:14:35.623 --> 00:14:39.890\ntoo, that we need to worry about or\nconsider for the exam.\n\n281\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.500\nWhat if I'm retrieving email?\n\n282\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.000\nWell, I'm not gonna be using SMTP.\n\n283\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.450\nAgain, it's outbound, it forwards email.\n\n284\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.796\nWhat I'm gonna be using instead is\nsomething kinda interesting called POP3.\n\n285\n00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:53.060\nNow I put POPv3,\nit's commonly just called POP3.\n\n286\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.304\nIt's POP version 3,\ndon't ask me about 1 and 2.\n\n287\n00:14:55.304 --> 00:14:57.778\nMaybe they didn't cut the mustard.\n\n288\n00:14:57.778 --> 00:15:02.400\n[LAUGH] But POP3, if you will,\nnotice the direction of the email.\n\n289\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.520\nAgain, this is retrieving email, right?\n\n290\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.870\nThis is a couple of jargon type terms,\nright?\n\n291\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.555\nPushing email is sending it, right?\n\n292\n00:15:11.555 --> 00:15:16.540\nPulling email is wherever it's located,\nwe're gonna download it to our computer.\n\n293\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.593\nNow there are some things that you have\nto keep in mind when it comes to POP3.\n\n294\n00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:26.645\nOne of those things is that when\nyou download your email from\n\n295\n00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:31.597\na computer that is storing POP3 emails,\nthat means it's\n\n296\n00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:37.360\ngoing to be erased off of that\nlocation that's storing it.\n\n297\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.080\nNow we don't really think about that too\nmuch today because we've got another type\n\n298\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.300\nthat we're gonna talk about\nthat allows us, for instance,\n\n299\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.300\nif you're using things like Outlook.\n\n300\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.357\nIf you're using things like Gmail, if\nyou're using Ymail, the old Hotmail.com,\n\n301\n00:15:49.357 --> 00:15:53.168\nOutlook.com, now,\nwe don't really think about that, why?\n\n302\n00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:56.420\nDan and I, we pull out our phones, we can\nlook at our email, we can sit here and\n\n303\n00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.141\nbe on the Macs, we can look at the email.\n\n304\n00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:01.813\nDan can go over to his Linux machine,\nturn around and look at the email, and\n\n305\n00:16:01.813 --> 00:16:02.466\nguess what?\n\n306\n00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:04.197\nAll these different devices.\n\n307\n00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.558\nIn POP3, when you pull the email down,\n\n308\n00:16:06.558 --> 00:16:10.040\nit erases off of the device\nthat's storing it, all right?\n\n309\n00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.440\nSo I'll give you a scenario where that\nmight cause some problems, all right?\n\n310\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.230\nSo you're sitting at the office,\nyou've got a POP3 server, or\n\n311\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.480\na POP3 computer in your network that's\nstoring into your mailbox, right?\n\n312\n00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.880\nStoring all your information, and\nwork I connect to the POP3 server.\n\n313\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.440\nI connect to the POP3 server and\nI download my computer or\n\n314\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.272\ndownload my information\non my work computer.\n\n315\n00:16:30.272 --> 00:16:30.960\nAll right?\n\n316\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.000\nBut here's the problem, see you also\nhave a project to work with, all right?\n\n317\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.830\nAnd you to do it over the weekend.\n\n318\n00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.430\nSo what do you do?\n\n319\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.240\nGo home,right?\n\n320\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.340\nUnless you're gonna work all\nweek at the office, you go home.\n\n321\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.080\nGuess what,\nwhen you connect back to the POP3 server,\n\n322\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.670\nyour email's not there anymore.\n\n323\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.530\nAlright, so\nthat is one of the limitations to POP3.\n\n324\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.890\nKeep in mind, there are options to\nleave copies on the server, but,\n\n325\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.750\nI don't want you to worry about that for\nthis exam.\n\n326\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.510\nJust understand when you download your\nemail you download it to the local storage\n\n327\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.030\ndevice on the machine and you erase\nit from the computer it's stored on.\n\n328\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.770\nAnd that brings us really to one of our\nlast email messages that I want you to be\n\n329\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.730\naware of, and\nthat's something known as IMAP, all right?\n\n330\n00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:16.680\nIMAP, kind of gives us the advantage\nof leaving the email on the server.\n\n331\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.620\nAnd what we do, is we just connect\nto that computer that's storing it.\n\n332\n00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.220\nAnd we can manage it, manipulate it.\n\n333\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.820\nWe can send e-mail.\n\n334\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.230\nWe can create folders and everything\nstays right on that single computer.\n\n335\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.960\nIn fact, I kinda got an example here, IMAP\nis the Internet Message Access Protocol,\n\n336\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.540\nInternet Mail Access Protocol.\n\n337\n00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.250\nI have heard a couple of different things,\nbut,\n\n338\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.130\nthis is where you're actually managing\nthe email up on that computer, right?\n\n339\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.200\nWe'll talk about it in another episode\nthe difference between what a server and\n\n340\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.190\na client is.\n\n341\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.960\nAll right?\n\n342\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.570\nThe benefit of this,\nis that you probably already used this.\n\n343\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.470\nIf you have email and in Gmail,\nif you used Outlook.com, if you will,\n\n344\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.800\nif you're using Ymail,\nall of these are examples of IMAP servers.\n\n345\n00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.840\nCuz if you think about it,\nall I need is a web browser, and\n\n346\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.120\nI log right into the service and\nI can manage all my email from that.\n\n347\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.410\nAll right, now a couple of the ports\nthat we need to talk about,\n\n348\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.380\nwhen it comes to those protocols.\n\n349\n00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.415\nWe're talking about POP3,\nwe're talking about port 110.\n\n350\n00:18:14.415 --> 00:18:17.290\nRetrieving email,\ndeleting it off the server.\n\n351\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.920\nWhen we talk about I'm Apple,\nwe're talking about as managing the email\n\n352\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.190\nup on that computer\nwhere it's being stored.\n\n353\n00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.900\nWe don't have to worry.\n\n354\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.650\nWe can view it.\n\n355\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.380\nWe can view from multiple devices,\nit doesn't matter it's gonna be there.\n\n356\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.630\nIt's gonna be in your inbox.\n\n357\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.570\nYour Inbox, my Inbox has got\nthousands of emails right now.\n\n358\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.970\nIt doesn't matter where I log in to.\n\n359\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.550\nAll I need is a web browser.\n\n360\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.870\nThat's gonna be port 143 All right,\nas a recap, SMTP port 25, port 3,\n\n361\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.050\nport 110, IMAP, Internet message access or\n\n362\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.760\nmail access protocol is gonna be port 143.\n\n363\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.190\nAll right, so what else do we have when\nit comes to rules of communication.\n\n364\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.810\nI want you to think about typing\nin your web browser, right?\n\n365\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.540\nYou say, I wanna go to let's say,\ngoogle.com, I wanna go to ITPRO.TV.\n\n366\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:09.850\nWell, I can actually type in www.itpro.tv\nand it'll take you to our website.\n\n367\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.060\nBut here's something interesting,\n\n368\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.560\nunderstand that communications\nare based on an address, right?\n\n369\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.820\nThe same thing as a mailing address and\na return address if you will.\n\n370\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.770\nThat's how we move information across\nthe United States postal system and\n\n371\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.660\nreally any kind of mail delivery system,\nright?\n\n372\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.410\nWe're using the address.\n\n373\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.980\nBut I want you to also keep this in mind,\n\n374\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.775\nthat addresses aren't really that\nfeasible to remember, right?\n\n375\n00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:39.035\nI want you to think about the last time\nyou got onto Facebook, ITPro.TV, Google,\n\n376\n00:19:39.035 --> 00:19:40.225\nMicrosoft and\n\n377\n00:19:40.225 --> 00:19:43.291\nyou've actually typed in what's known\nas an Internet protocol address.\n\n378\n00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.922\n70.120.30.15.\n\n379\n00:19:45.922 --> 00:19:48.720\nProbably never, right?\n\n380\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.630\nIt's been awhile.\n\n381\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.250\n&gt;&gt; It's been awhile.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.560\n&gt;&gt; It's been a very long while.\n\n383\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.080\nThat's right.\n\n384\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.680\nAnd that's where our\nnext service comes in.\n\n385\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.340\nThe next service that we're gonna\ntalk about is what we known DNS.\n\n386\n00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.250\nIt's called the Domain Name System.\n\n387\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.590\nAnd what it's responsible for and\nwe definitely go into this more,\n\n388\n00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.840\nthe networking section and\nsome of the episodes here in 901.\n\n389\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.160\nIt allows me to have a user\nfriendly name and it\n\n390\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.960\nmaps it to an IP address, and I don't have\nto worry about what the address is, right?\n\n391\n00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.890\nIt's like me saying I'm gonna call Dan,\nright?\n\n392\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.440\nWell, how do I call Dan?\n\n393\n00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.020\nI've got Dan's number.\n\n394\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.170\nI can check the listing if I want,\nbut I'm not good at memory on that,\n\n395\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:24.700\nso what do I do?\n\n396\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.420\nI look at my phone and I say, Dan.\n\n397\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.100\nI push the button and it does the dialing\nof the number in the background.\n\n398\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.130\nWell it's kinda the way DNS works when\nyou're doing things like connecting to\n\n399\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.610\ncomputers over the internet.\n\n400\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.000\nA web server is nothing more than a\ncomputer that's hosting a website, right?\n\n401\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.400\nAnd if I need to go to a website, I don't\ntype in any kind of numerical number.\n\n402\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.870\nI just type in the name.\n\n403\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.760\nSo DNS understand and obeying name system.\n\n404\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.060\nAnd you can check out our DNS episodes to\nunderstand what the hierarchy is Also,\n\n405\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.120\nknow the port.\n\n406\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.090\nIn fact I've got kind of\na little diagram here.\n\n407\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.500\nYou know when we talk about DNS\nbasically what's the IP address.\n\n408\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.130\nNow you aren't asking that but\n\n409\n00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.490\nthe protocol underneath is\ngoing to help you do that.\n\n410\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.850\nThat's going to be port 53.\n\n411\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:04.400\nAll right.\n\n412\n00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.060\nSo remember for\nDNS domain name system, port 53.\n\n413\n00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.250\nThat is a major service.\n\n414\n00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.160\nOne of the major services out\nthere on the Internet t hat really\n\n415\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.910\nallows us to communicate.\n\n416\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Wes, that really kind of like segways\nus to talking about web right, because\n\n417\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.540\nweb also has its own ports and protocols\nassociated with it as well, right?\n\n418\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.090\n&gt;&gt; It way most definitely d oes,\nso how am I going to connect?\n\n419\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.215\nLike you said, if I do type in\nwww.google.com, what's going on there?\n\n420\n00:21:30.215 --> 00:21:34.795\nRight, well, I want you to think\nabout your web browser, right?\n\n421\n00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.295\nAny web browser you want, right?\n\n422\n00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:40.435\nIf you happen to use Internet Explorer or\nEdge or you happen to use Firefox, Chrome,\n\n423\n00:21:40.435 --> 00:21:41.975\nI use Chrome a lot.\n\n424\n00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:45.930\nOpera, Safari, any of the web\nbrowsers that you use on any device.\n\n425\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.040\nWhat are you doing when you see\nthe image that's in front of you?\n\n426\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.580\nWell, what you're doing is actually\nusing a protocol known as HTTP.\n\n427\n00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.220\nThat the hyper text transfer protocol.\n\n428\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:59.140\nAll right, web pages have a DNA,\na language that they're written in.\n\n429\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.040\nI kind of call it the DNA of a web page.\n\n430\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.260\nAnd that's something known as HTML.\n\n431\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.720\nIn fact, got a little diagram here.\n\n432\n00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.400\nLet's show you that.\n\n433\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.660\nHTTP, hypertext transfer protocol.\n\n434\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.910\nYou use a web browser, and\nthe web browser connects to\n\n435\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.800\na powerful computer called a server,\nthat's providing you that service, right?\n\n436\n00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.500\nThat's why they call it a server.\n\n437\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.260\nThat server on it has text information,\nright?\n\n438\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.310\nHTML.\n\n439\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.480\nAnd when you connect via your web browser,\nwhat happens is over HTTP,\n\n440\n00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.510\nthe hyper text transfer protocol,\nthe server actually delivers\n\n441\n00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.285\nthat HTML HTML down to the web browser,\nand the web browser renders the webpage.\n\n442\n00:22:37.285 --> 00:22:40.605\nAnd, you see it, we don't see all that,\nwell you can if you really wanted to.\n\n443\n00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:41.955\nBut, we don't see all this text.\n\n444\n00:22:41.955 --> 00:22:45.425\nWhat we see is the nice graphical\ninterface that allows us to interact\n\n445\n00:22:45.425 --> 00:22:46.445\nwith the website.\n\n446\n00:22:47.705 --> 00:22:51.395\nNow, remember when we were talking about\ntelnet, and we were talking about SSH, and\n\n447\n00:22:51.395 --> 00:22:54.300\nthe fact that telnet anybody\ncan see what you're doing.\n\n448\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.610\nSSH, Dan would protect his devices\nif Wes puts his black hat on and\n\n449\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.300\ndecides to grab that information.\n\n450\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.380\nJust look like a bunch\nof scrambled garbage.\n\n451\n00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.640\nWell here's a problem with HTTP.\n\n452\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:09.120\nHTTP is one in which\nis plain text as well.\n\n453\n00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.310\nWhich means that if somebody is\nout there and let's say, and\n\n454\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.210\nthis doesn't happen today, for\nobvious reasons here in a second.\n\n455\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.640\nLet's say you were connecting to your\nbank account over your bank's website.\n\n456\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.670\nDo you really think you would want\nsomebody being able to grab that\n\n457\n00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.250\ninformation?\n\n458\n00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.650\nFind out what your credit card\nnumbers are, your password,\n\n459\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.800\nyour banking information?\n\n460\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.611\n&gt;&gt; I've got nothing to hide.\n\n461\n00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:29.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, that's right.\n\n462\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.154\nLet me use your computer\na little later too.\n\n463\n00:23:31.154 --> 00:23:33.650\nRight?\nSo, joking aside,\n\n464\n00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.300\nwe don't want that information\nending up in the wrong hands and\n\n465\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.800\nthat's where something\nknown as HTTPS comes in.\n\n466\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.860\nHTTPS is whats known as hyper\ntext transfer protocol.\n\n467\n00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.990\nSame thing, over secure socket layers,\nsomething known as SSL.\n\n468\n00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.190\nSSL is a way to scramble that information.\n\n469\n00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:57.482\nIt uses an encryption process where\nit's basically take your data,\n\n470\n00:23:57.482 --> 00:24:02.520\nrun to a mathematical operation the output\nbecomes scrambled garbage, right?\n\n471\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:08.309\nSo, if something like that was going on\nagain I put my attacker hat on and dance.\n\n472\n00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:11.562\nConnect to do his bank information or\nhis bank account.\n\n473\n00:24:11.562 --> 00:24:14.720\nWell guess what, I am not going to\nbe able to see the information.\n\n474\n00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.970\nHTTPS is very very important when you\nwant, what's known as confidentiality,\n\n475\n00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.670\nthat the authorized people from\nbeginning to end point are the only ones\n\n476\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.050\nthat can actually see that information.\n\n477\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:30.210\nNow, I want you to know a couple different\nports as well with these protocols too.\n\n478\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.290\nYou have what's known,\nHTTP goes over port 80.\n\n479\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.740\nAnd when we talk about HTTPS,\nwe're talking about port 443.\n\n480\n00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.360\nDefinitely know those ports for the exam.\n\n481\n00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.800\nAll right then, so\nlet's look at a couple more.\n\n482\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.280\nOn some of these I don't\nreally have a diagram for it,\n\n483\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.350\nI just kinda wanna talk about.\n\n484\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.920\nWe talked about remote\nlog on SSH is very common\n\n485\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.490\nin things like your network-based devices,\nand in NIC systems, it's almost the,\n\n486\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:01.705\nit's the go to when you're connecting to\na Linux computer or you're connecting to\n\n487\n00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:07.275\na Unix computer if you will to work with\nit right cuz it encrypts the information.\n\n488\n00:25:07.275 --> 00:25:11.425\nWindows doesn't really fall back on SSH.\n\n489\n00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:13.585\nNow they have SSH clients\nthat you can use.\n\n490\n00:25:13.585 --> 00:25:17.775\nBut it's not as common as something that's\nbuilt in to the operating system as well,\n\n491\n00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:18.615\nalready.\n\n492\n00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:20.575\nAnd that's an application\ncalled Remote Desktop.\n\n493\n00:25:20.575 --> 00:25:23.815\nAnd Remote Desktop allows me to connect\n\n494\n00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:28.790\nover the network to a windows\nbased device and take over it and\n\n495\n00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.340\nlook at the desktop just as if I\nwas in the same physical location.\n\n496\n00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:38.050\nSigning in locally to the computer, now\nremote desktop uses a protocol called RDP.\n\n497\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.400\nAnd if you can remember remote\ndesktop you can remember\n\n498\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.250\nwhat two thirds of the acronym right?\n\n499\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.700\n&gt;&gt; What is the protocol for\nremote desktop?\n\n500\n00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.735\n&gt;&gt; How about Remote Desktop Protocol?\n\n501\n00:25:47.735 --> 00:25:50.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that one there, right?\n\n502\n00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.120\nNow be careful with this one because I am\ngonna talk about another protocol next and\n\n503\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.105\nthe port numbers are very, very close.\n\n504\n00:25:56.105 --> 00:25:59.170\nAll right,\nremote desktop protocol uses port 3389.\n\n505\n00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:05.760\nIt's how we identify somebody that\nis connecting over an RDP connection\n\n506\n00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:12.980\nThat being said, there's other type of\nconnections we need to make, right?\n\n507\n00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.780\nSometimes we need to connect to\na computer that is storing a file or\n\n508\n00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.940\na something known a sa database,\na directory.\n\n509\n00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.525\nA directory service if you will.\n\n510\n00:26:20.525 --> 00:26:24.645\nIt stores all of the information about\nall the network devices if you will that\n\n511\n00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:28.805\nare connected to our network, all the\nusers within our corporations and stuff,\n\n512\n00:26:28.805 --> 00:26:31.495\nand then sometimes our\ncomputers need to communicate\n\n513\n00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:33.595\nwith that type of device, right?\n\n514\n00:26:33.595 --> 00:26:36.495\nSomething, a computer\nrunning a directory service.\n\n515\n00:26:36.495 --> 00:26:38.395\nAnd it does that with\nsomething know as LDAP.\n\n516\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.280\nLDAP is a light weight\ndirect reassess protocol.\n\n517\n00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.250\nThe reason I mention RDP and\n\n518\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.320\nLDAP in the same,\nthey're not the same type of protocol.\n\n519\n00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.630\nThey're completely different things.\n\n520\n00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.650\nIt's because the port\nnumbers are almost identical.\n\n521\n00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.310\nLDAP uses port 389.\n\n522\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.690\nThat's only reason I put them together.\n\n523\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.630\nIt's one of the things that I've done to\nhelp people get those right on the exam.\n\n524\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:04.850\n3389 is a Windows Remote\nDesktop Connection, or RDP.\n\n525\n00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.410\nWhen we're communicating\nwith a directory service,\n\n526\n00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:13.250\nwe're talking about lightweight directory\naccesss protocool, and that's port 389.\n\n527\n00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.130\nI do want you guys to remember that.\n\n528\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.940\nNow we also have, we talked a little\nbit about FTP being a file,\n\n529\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.920\nbasically you could communicate and upload\nand download files over the network,\n\n530\n00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.500\nwell there are other technologies that are\nout there as well, that allow us things\n\n531\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.390\nlike file sharing, the ability to access\nthose resources across the network.\n\n532\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.810\nThere's a hand full of them.\n\n533\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:38.740\nAll right.\n\n534\n00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.958\nOne of the most common ones today is\nwhat's known as Server Message Block,\n\n535\n00:27:41.958 --> 00:27:48.120\nas well as, this kinda uses SMB,\ntoo, as well.\n\n536\n00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.155\nAnd that's something known as\nthe Common Internet File System.\n\n537\n00:27:51.155 --> 00:27:54.815\nIt basically provides access to our\nshared network based resources.\n\n538\n00:27:54.815 --> 00:27:59.045\nSuch as files, printers, or\nin the earlier days, maybe serial ports,\n\n539\n00:27:59.045 --> 00:28:01.645\nif you will, the com ports,\none com, two com, three com,\n\n540\n00:28:01.645 --> 00:28:06.920\ncom four that we talked about\ninside of our PC connections.\n\n541\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.560\nAll right, now SNB, that use port 445,\nsame thing with CIFS,\n\n542\n00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.090\nagain common internet file system.\n\n543\n00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.680\nIt's actually based on SNB.\n\n544\n00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.420\nThere are other ones out there too,\nthat I want you to be aware of likewise.\n\n545\n00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.510\nAnd I know I'm kind of\njumping around here, Dan.\n\n546\n00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.140\nThere's also what's known\nas the Apple file protocol.\n\n547\n00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:34.315\nThis is actually a renaming of AFP used to\nbe called Apple Talk in the earlier days.\n\n548\n00:28:34.315 --> 00:28:36.370\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I know you remember Apple Talk.\n\n549\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.910\nThey renamed it as the time went on.\n\n550\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:45.070\nAnd, guys, it really shares a lot of\nthe same characteristics as FTP and SMB.\n\n551\n00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.530\nBut it's specific to Apple, macOSs, right?\n\n552\n00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.480\nAnd I say Apple File Protocol.\n\n553\n00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.700\nI always get that wrong.\n\n554\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.325\nIt's Filing, I-N-G at the end.\n\n555\n00:28:55.325 --> 00:28:56.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apple Filing Protocol.\n\n556\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.540\nAnd again, it used to be called AppleTalk,\nand it provides access to network file\n\n557\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.619\nservices, so that I can communicate over\nthe network and download those files.\n\n558\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.320\nNow we also mentioned DNS\nas being a naming protocol.\n\n559\n00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.360\nThere's one last naming protocol\nthat I do want to talk about, and\n\n560\n00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.120\nthat's something called NetBIOS.\n\n561\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.160\nThey also say NetBT in here.\n\n562\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.180\nAs more often it's called NetBIOS and\neven the later replacement was called\n\n563\n00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:26.980\nNetBEUI cuz BEUI is an extended user\ninterface so they added some things to it.\n\n564\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:32.440\nWhen we talk about NetBIOS,\nJust like we said DNS takes names and\n\n565\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.520\nresolves them to IP addresses,\nto addresses, if you will.\n\n566\n00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.430\nIn your internal local networks,\n\n567\n00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:43.880\nand check out our other networking\nepisode for what a LAN is.\n\n568\n00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.600\nBut in the local area networks, Windows\nmachines Could identify devices and\n\n569\n00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.560\nsend information to their addresses\nby what was known as NetBIOS names.\n\n570\n00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.330\nNetBIOS, there's a lot\nof limitations to it and\n\n571\n00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.490\nthe fact that in DNS you have a hierarchy.\n\n572\n00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.670\nSo the names are unique\nacross the entire Internet.\n\n573\n00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.820\nIn NetBIOS,\n\n574\n00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:11.250\nit's what they call a single label\nname that also maps to an IP address.\n\n575\n00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.130\nBut the problem is,\n\n576\n00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.390\nwith single label names, there's not\nenough uniqueness to them, right?\n\n577\n00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.880\nThere's plenty of Dans in the world.\n\n578\n00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.480\nThere's plenty of Wes' in the world,\nright?\n\n579\n00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.160\nBut it's my full name\nthat makes it unique.\n\n580\n00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:22.670\nAnd even at that,\n\n581\n00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.230\nI guess I could say there's plenty of\nprobably Wes Bryans in the world, too.\n\n582\n00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.990\nSo NetBIOS is like that,\nit'd be like saying Dan.\n\n583\n00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.300\nAll right,\nwell if we're in a crowd of 4,000 people,\n\n584\n00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.980\nchances are there's gonna be\nmore than one Dan, all right?\n\n585\n00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.380\nOr John, or Bill, or Bob,\nSally, Susie, if you will.\n\n586\n00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.490\nSo these single names can be used\ntypically in small environments within\n\n587\n00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:48.970\nyour internal networks but they're not\ngonna be unique outside of the internet.\n\n588\n00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.740\nSo again kind of a dying legacy\ntechnology, still used today but\n\n589\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.700\nagain we're starting to see that\neventually it's gonna be phased out.\n\n590\n00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.090\nSo, I didn't mention the port numbers for\na couple of them,\n\n591\n00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.935\nI just noticed that When\nwe talk about net bios or\n\n592\n00:31:04.935 --> 00:31:09.660\nnetBT you're talking about port 137\nactually port 137 and 139 as well.\n\n593\n00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:15.390\nAFP I didn't mention\nthe apple filing protocol\n\n594\n00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:21.600\nthat is port 548 So do keep that in mind.\n\n595\n00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.030\nLast but not least,\n\n596\n00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.460\nI want to talk about something known as\nthe Service Location Protocol, that's SLP.\n\n597\n00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.170\nThis is also something that's also in\nIOS devices and your Mac OS devices.\n\n598\n00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.210\nEssentially what it does is it\nallows devices that are on a network\n\n599\n00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.850\nto call out and say hey I've got\nthis service or hey I'm looking for\n\n600\n00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.990\nthis service or\nhey I want to find this device.\n\n601\n00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:48.900\nIt's specific to the Mac world\nif you will, and IOS devices.\n\n602\n00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.269\nAll right.\nIt's a an example of what they call\n\n603\n00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:55.370\na zero-config technology, which means\nyou don't have to configure it.\n\n604\n00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.459\nThese devices can do this themselves.\n\n605\n00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:01.249\nYou know, I always sound like Colombo\nin these episodes, I'm just like,\n\n606\n00:32:01.249 --> 00:32:01.882\none more thing.\n\n607\n00:32:01.882 --> 00:32:02.683\n&gt;&gt; Just one more thing.\n\n608\n00:32:02.683 --> 00:32:07.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Last two things that I wanna\ntalk about is TCP and UDP, all right?\n\n609\n00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.960\nThese are two different\ntransport protocols.\n\n610\n00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.730\nThese are the protocols\nthat actually move the data\n\n611\n00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.410\nin between your computers\nacross the network, all right?\n\n612\n00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.850\nYou use them for different reasons.\n\n613\n00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.590\nThe very first one, TCP,\ntransmission control protocol,\n\n614\n00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.910\nis what's known as\na connection oriented service.\n\n615\n00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:28.370\nIt means that when I communicate with\nyou I'm gonna ask you, did you get that?\n\n616\n00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.210\nDid you get it in the right order?\n\n617\n00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.998\nI need to know, let me know.\n\n618\n00:32:31.998 --> 00:32:34.940\nBecause I wanna make sure that\nthat information got there and\n\n619\n00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.560\nit also got there the way it\nwas supposed to get there.\n\n620\n00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.935\nAnd if you tell me you didn't get it,\nguess what I'm gonna do?\n\n621\n00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:41.485\nI'll resend you the package, right?\n\n622\n00:32:41.485 --> 00:32:44.445\nSo this is kinda like delivery\nconfirmation in the mail, right?\n\n623\n00:32:44.445 --> 00:32:45.595\n&gt;&gt; Certified mail, right?\n\n624\n00:32:45.595 --> 00:32:46.625\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly what it is.\n\n625\n00:32:46.625 --> 00:32:49.285\n&gt;&gt; So you have to sign and\nsay yes, this was delivered to me.\n\n626\n00:32:49.285 --> 00:32:50.890\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n627\n00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:56.110\nUDP on the other hand,\ndoesn't require the extra processing power\n\n628\n00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.540\nbecause sometimes you just need\nto get things there fast, right?\n\n629\n00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.940\nI want you to think of that,\nit's called a connection list service, and\n\n630\n00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.170\nthat's like for instance, rather than\nthe certified mail, I love the analog,\n\n631\n00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.710\nimagine you guys out there, at least in\nthe U.S, go out and find the blue mailbox.\n\n632\n00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.180\nDo you really sit by that blue mailbox and\nwait?\n\n633\n00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.250\nYou might look on the outside of it and\nsay, okay,\n\n634\n00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.590\nso they're gonna pick\nthis mail up at five.\n\n635\n00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.480\nIf you do that, right?\n\n636\n00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.030\nWhat do you do?\n\n637\n00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.990\nYou throw it in the mailbox and\nyou drive away.\n\n638\n00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.740\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about UPS, where they\njust leave it at your doorstep and\n\n639\n00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.330\nthey, delivered at door.\n\n640\n00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.630\nSomebody could have came and\nstole it, and it's not there.\n\n641\n00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.170\nBut as far as they're concerned,\nthey delivered it.\n\n642\n00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.416\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthat's called best effort delivery, right?\n\n643\n00:33:33.416 --> 00:33:38.180\nIt's connectionless service, and\nthe benefit is it's smaller in its\n\n644\n00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.400\nprocessing necessities which means\nyou can get information faster.\n\n645\n00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.900\nWith transmission control\nprotocol we gotta go through\n\n646\n00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.840\nan extra few steps cuz I'm gonna say,\ndid you get it?\n\n647\n00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.890\nDid you get it?\n\n648\n00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.280\nYou didn't.\nWell, let me resend it right.\n\n649\n00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.970\nTakes a little bit more\ncomputational power.\n\n650\n00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.830\nAnd there are reasons we want stuff\ndelivered in the right order,\n\n651\n00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.238\nversus some things like video.\n\n652\n00:33:56.238 --> 00:33:58.099\nSend it, I don't care.\n\n653\n00:33:58.099 --> 00:34:01.900\nIf I miss something, don't try to\nrebuild the play on fourth down.\n\n654\n00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.690\nJust give me a little glitch and\nlet's keep moving on, right?\n\n655\n00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:09.090\nSo you can see that there are necessities\nfor the two different transport protocols.\n\n656\n00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\nthat was a laundry list of ports and\n\n657\n00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.360\nprotocols for our good viewers out there\nto, that's right, create some flashcards,\n\n658\n00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.730\ndo the rope memorization thing,\nsimmer into this, I like to say,\n\n659\n00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.500\nuntil you get them buried into your brain\nso that you can answer any question.\n\n660\n00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.294\nBecause it's a lot,\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n661\n00:34:26.294 --> 00:34:30.324\nIt will take a little bit of effort for\nyou to be able to go, yeah, SMTP,\n\n662\n00:34:30.324 --> 00:34:32.281\nnot a problem, that's port 25.\n\n663\n00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:34.485\nFor you to be able to do that will\ntake you a little bit of time,\n\n664\n00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:37.100\nunless you're some cool savant,\nthat would be awesome, right?\n\n665\n00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.630\nPhotographic memory and\nthat kind of thing.\n\n666\n00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.810\nUsually for us mere mortals though,\nit does take effort.\n\n667\n00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.710\nSo dig in your heels, memorize these\nthings, and get ready for that exam.\n\n668\n00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.010\nThat being said,\nwe are well out of time for this episode,\n\n669\n00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.420\nwe do thank you for watching.\n\n670\n00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.330\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n671\n00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.010\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.233\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:12.168\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:14.019\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.867\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.514\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n8\n00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:22.232\nwe are continuing on,\nwith more in our A+ series, that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:25.487\nThere is a lot of content when\nis comes to the good old A+.\n\n10\n00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:29.070\nAnd joining us in the endeavor,\nour good friend Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.910\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.600\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.560\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.370\nGot the coffee in me.\n\n15\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.660\nReady to go and ready to spit\nout some more specifications.\n\n16\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.620\nThat's right, as Dan says, we are\ncontinuing along in A+ and he is right.\n\n17\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660\nAnd that is what this episode is gonna\nbe about, is really about standards.\n\n18\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.897\nAnd more specifically,\nwe're gonna talk about wifi standards.\n\n19\n00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:52.986\nIn a previous episode, we talked about\nsome of the channels you can expect to see\n\n20\n00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.110\nif you're configuring things\nlike a SOHO wireless router.\n\n21\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.889\nAnd really understand guys,\nany basic home router or\n\n22\n00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.162\neven enterprise level wireless router is\ngonna be using those same frequencies.\n\n23\n00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.272\nBut we're gonna talk more about\nthe standard themselves, and\n\n24\n00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:08.392\nwhat we mean by the standards themselves.\n\n25\n00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:10.974\nWe're talking about the IEEE.\n\n26\n00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:17.129\nWe're talking about the Institute for\nElectrical and let's try that again.\n\n27\n00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:20.660\nThe Institute for Electrical and\nelectronic engineers.\n\n28\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.044\nBoy, I can remember the acronyms,\nbut getting them from here to here,\n\n29\n00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:23.851\nsometimes difficult.\n\n30\n00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.104\n&gt;&gt; What was it the Zoolander school for\nkids who don't read well?\n\n31\n00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:27.291\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Or don't read so good or\n\n32\n00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:28.334\nsomething like that [LAUGH]?\n\n33\n00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.160\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\nYeah, I'm speaking it, right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.970\n&gt;&gt; You went to that school, right?\n\n35\n00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] l did, I did.\n\n36\n00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:33.396\nI was their valedictorian.\n\n37\n00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:36.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're going to be talking about\n\n38\n00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:40.084\nthe IEEE, and keep in mind that\nthe IEEE is an organization\n\n39\n00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:45.011\nthat essentially promotes things like\nelectrical sciences, standardizes that.\n\n40\n00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:49.363\nThey standardize all kinds of things\nlike nuclear energy as well, so\n\n41\n00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:53.052\na lot of different things\nthat they're responsible for.\n\n42\n00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:53.880\nLet's go ahead and\n\n43\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.080\ntalk about just briefly about why\nwe want the standardization, right.\n\n44\n00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.640\nStandardization really is about\nconsistency and interoperability.\n\n45\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.775\nSee, in the earlier days of networking and\nreally just in computing, everybody is\n\n46\n00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:08.433\ndoing everything their own way, and then,\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like it's about the man trying\n\n47\n00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:09.306\nto keep me down, Wes.\n\n48\n00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:10.298\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but\n\n49\n00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:12.102\nwe're not gonna talk about\nbig brother right now.\n\n50\n00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:17.389\n[LAUGH] That's for another episode for\nthe tin foil Adams, so in the early days\n\n51\n00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:23.020\nwhat we would have is everybody was trying\nto implement things just their own way.\n\n52\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.830\nAnd the problem with that,\nI mean it's not really a bad thing,\n\n53\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.270\ncuz most manufacturers implement\nstuff today their own way.\n\n54\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.925\nBut you get vendor locked, right?\n\n55\n00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:35.659\nIf you had this one computer component,\nyou'd have to have their hard drive or\n\n56\n00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.775\ntheir motherboard-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n57\n00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:42.603\nif somebody makes a competitive\nproduct at a better price.\n\n58\n00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:45.970\nIf I'm locked into this vendor,\nI can't just easily switch over.\n\n59\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.380\nI've gotta do a whole retool,\nand then I'm locked into them.\n\n60\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.080\nAnd if somebody else\ncomes out with something,\n\n61\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.310\nit's nice to be able to\ndo that interoperability.\n\n62\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.637\n&gt;&gt; It is, right?\nIt gives us selection and choice and\n\n63\n00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:57.551\nthat's very, very, it's handy.\n\n64\n00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:01.431\nThe other thing is to keep in mind\nis the consistency part, right?\n\n65\n00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:06.515\nIf you have devices that follow a set\nof standards, then what happens is,\n\n66\n00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:12.135\nus as consumers, what we do, is we could\njust figure out who we like better.\n\n67\n00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:14.098\nWho do we think makes a better product,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:16.225\nAnd that's really what\nstandardization is about.\n\n69\n00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.345\nIt's about that consistency and\ninteroperability.\n\n70\n00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:22.575\nSo it's a good thing that we\nhave it today in our network.\n\n71\n00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:28.970\nSo now, talking about the IEEE,\nthey standardized something known as 802.\n\n72\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.270\n802 is what we know as local area network\ncommunications and there are tons of them.\n\n73\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.960\nWell, more than we can go into and\n\n74\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.410\nreally well more than you even\nreally need to know for the A+ exam.\n\n75\n00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.557\nBut under those standards,\n\n76\n00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:44.820\nthey also have what's known as wireless\nlocal area network standards, right?\n\n77\n00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.970\n802 comes from the fact\nthat they met in February,\n\n78\n00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.986\nthe second month of the year and\n1980, right?\n\n79\n00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:53.110\nIt was a bunch of manufacturers as well,\nright?\n\n80\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.420\nApple was there, Microsoft was there,\na lot of different manufacturers,\n\n81\n00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.480\nIntel was there.\n\n82\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.362\nA lot of different,\nIBM was another one that was there.\n\n83\n00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:04.230\nAnd that formed the basis for local area\nnetwork communications and what we mean\n\n84\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.050\nis that single geographical location\nthat we talked about in other episodes.\n\n85\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.290\nNow, under 802,\nwe have things like ethernet, right,\n\n86\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.190\nwired standards like 802.3 and\nall of its variants.\n\n87\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.670\nWell, wireless standards are specifically,\n\n88\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.886\nwireless local area networks are what\nare known as 802.11 standards, and\n\n89\n00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:24.432\nI want you to know that for\nthe certifications for the exam, right?\n\n90\n00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:28.007\nIt is important, because remember we\nhave been stressing through this SAS\n\n91\n00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.290\nseries is that you\nare learning a new language.\n\n92\n00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.838\nEven if the language is a little\nbit intimidation to you,\n\n93\n00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:35.668\nkeep in mind you're gonna have to\nprove you know it on the exam.\n\n94\n00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:37.415\nSo 802.11, right?\n\n95\n00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:41.208\n802.11 comes in and\nit basically forms the standardization for\n\n96\n00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:42.760\nwireless communications.\n\n97\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.719\nNow, 802.11 had a very brief stint and\nit's so\n\n98\n00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.961\nbrief I don't believe it was\never released to the market.\n\n99\n00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:51.791\nHowever, they have a series\nof other standards\n\n100\n00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.140\nthat fall within that 802.11 family.\n\n101\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.303\nAnd those are the things that\nwe wanna talk about right now.\n\n102\n00:04:57.303 --> 00:05:01.020\nWhat we wanna talk about\nare the different 802.11 standards.\n\n103\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.390\nNow, I got a little diagram here,\n\n104\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.459\nand this is, guys I understand,\nthis is gonna be, or ladies and gentlemen,\n\n105\n00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.030\nI understand this is gonna be\na laundry list of specifications.\n\n106\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.760\nBut it is gonna be something\nyou need to know for the exam.\n\n107\n00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.220\nYou know, here at ITProTV, we really\nlike to show you these things and\n\n108\n00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.508\nnot just talk about it, but\nI apologize ahead of time.\n\n109\n00:05:17.508 --> 00:05:21.116\nThis is gonna be a lot of talk guys and\ngals out there, and, again,\n\n110\n00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:22.094\nit is important.\n\n111\n00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:25.660\nSo when we look at these standards,\nwe have quite a few of them today, right?\n\n112\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.547\nWe have what is known as 802.11a and\n802.11b.\n\n113\n00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:33.028\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead, and\nwe'll stop right there for a second and\n\n114\n00:05:33.028 --> 00:05:36.872\nwe'll talk about some of the later\nones here, because 802.11a and b.\n\n115\n00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:40.611\nNow Dan, based on the alphabetic\n[LAUGH] to the letter right?\n\n116\n00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:42.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which one would you say was\n\n117\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.081\nreleased first?\n\n118\n00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:43.889\n&gt;&gt; I would think a.\n\n119\n00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.598\n&gt;&gt; You would always think a [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right because that's how letters work.\n\n120\n00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:47.857\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n121\n00:05:47.857 --> 00:05:52.227\nI mean numbers are sequential like that\ntoo and you're absolutely wrong, which\n\n122\n00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:56.870\nmeans [LAUGH] it's so confusing because,\nwhat happened guys and I'm picking on Dan.\n\n123\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.120\nI know he already knows this.\n\n124\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.910\nBoth of those standards were actually\nreleased in 1999 at the same time.\n\n125\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.590\nHere's what happened.\n\n126\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.750\nBecause of the expense of 802.11a devices,\nwhich we'll talk about a little bit more,\n\n127\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.790\nthey didn't hit the market as prevalent\nas b devices did, so everybody thinks,\n\n128\n00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.620\nwell, a, it had to been released first or\nwhat happens.\n\n129\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.144\nSo just to understand that they\nwere both released in 1999, right?\n\n130\n00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:22.954\nSo it's still a relatively new\ntechnology just by computing standards,\n\n131\n00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:27.040\neven though we can probably consider\na little bit legacy, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.940\nNow, the next one that we have\nis what is known as 802.11g.\n\n133\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.132\nIn 2003, the IEEE standardized\nwhat would eventually,\n\n134\n00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:39.225\nnot necessarily replaced, but\nit's a revision of the standard, right.\n\n135\n00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:43.835\nAnd then, I wanna say 2009ish,\ndon't quote me on that one, but\n\n136\n00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:49.337\nI think it was September of 2009\nthey formally standardized 802.11n.\n\n137\n00:06:49.337 --> 00:06:50.666\n&gt;&gt; I wish that was on the exam.\n\n138\n00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:51.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.895\n&gt;&gt; When was this standardized?\n\n140\n00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:57.439\nWas it 1997, 2000, or 2009-ish?\n\n141\n00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, well I love the ish.\n\n142\n00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:00.314\n&gt;&gt; C.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gotta be C.\n\n143\n00:07:00.314 --> 00:07:00.841\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was totally C.\n\n144\n00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:02.084\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n145\n00:07:02.084 --> 00:07:07.394\nthen I want to say 2013 is when\nthey standardized 802.11c.\n\n146\n00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:10.592\nIt could be a little bit later, but\nI think we're right around there.\n\n147\n00:07:10.592 --> 00:07:13.699\nSo the reason I show you that,\nis that we're talking about what?\n\n148\n00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.377\nAround 13 years?\n\n149\n00:07:16.377 --> 00:07:17.633\n13 or 14 years?\n\n150\n00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:21.112\nIsh, yes, there's an ish there.\n\n151\n00:07:21.112 --> 00:07:23.504\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I'd be smoking all sorts of exams.\n\n152\n00:07:23.504 --> 00:07:24.271\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n153\n00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:25.080\n&gt;&gt; Gotta add the ish in there.\n\n154\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.125\n&gt;&gt; I got a 901, and\nthat's theoretically impossible.\n\n155\n00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:30.342\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n156\n00:07:30.342 --> 00:07:32.482\nyou can see that we have some\ndifferent standards, right?\n\n157\n00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:37.073\nNow, these are the standards that you\nhave to be aware of on the exams, so\n\n158\n00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:41.515\nI do what you to know their IEEE\nspecification number, all right, and\n\n159\n00:07:41.515 --> 00:07:43.192\nletter adjacent to that.\n\n160\n00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:45.552\nNow, we're gonna talk about\nsome different characteristics.\n\n161\n00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:49.350\nThey talk about speed,\ndistances, and frequencies and\n\n162\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:54.188\nwhich one you use will Kind of limit or\ngive you the gain of these, right?\n\n163\n00:07:54.188 --> 00:07:57.581\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive\ninto the different standards, and\n\n164\n00:07:57.581 --> 00:07:59.114\nwe'll start with frequency.\n\n165\n00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:01.336\nIn an earlier episode,\nwe talked about channels, and\n\n166\n00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:04.766\none of the things I mentioned within those\nchannels is that they operate in different\n\n167\n00:08:04.766 --> 00:08:05.653\nspectrums, right?\n\n168\n00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:09.805\nThe two spectrums that we use\nare the 2.4 gigahertz ISM band, right?\n\n169\n00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:11.672\nIndustrial, scientifical,\nand medical band.\n\n170\n00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:15.525\nIt's an unregulated band that was\nreleased by the FCC a long time ago.\n\n171\n00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:21.133\nA lot of devices operate in it, that\naren't wireless and including wireless.\n\n172\n00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.049\nYou'll also see the 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n173\n00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:26.177\nThe 5 gigahertz spectrum is the UNIII,\n\n174\n00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:28.868\n[LAUGH] I always call it UNI-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:30.554\n&gt;&gt; UNI for short.\n\n176\n00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:34.753\nAgain, it's a national band and\nit is heavily regulated, but\n\n177\n00:08:34.753 --> 00:08:36.507\nno 5 gigahertz, right?\n\n178\n00:08:36.507 --> 00:08:40.373\nAnd then also bump back to that episode to\nremember some of the things that Dan and\n\n179\n00:08:40.373 --> 00:08:42.804\nI talked about when it comes to channels,\nright?\n\n180\n00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:46.280\nBut here, we want to know the frequencies\nin which the standard operate in.\n\n181\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.908\nWe're not really too worried about\nthe channels per se, if you will.\n\n182\n00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:53.138\nI want you to notice that we have 802.11a.\n\n183\n00:08:53.138 --> 00:08:58.789\n802.11a works and operates in the 5\ngigahertz spectrum, all right,?\n\n184\n00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:00.588\nIf you look at 802.11b,\n\n185\n00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:05.582\nyou'll see that it operates in 2.4\ngigahertz spectrum as well as 802.11g.\n\n186\n00:09:05.582 --> 00:09:08.133\nNow I'm gonna talk just briefly, and\nyou'll see it come up here in the list.\n\n187\n00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:11.848\nBut we'll go ahead and just mention it\nhere before the list ever shows you.\n\n188\n00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:15.382\nIs that g and b, you can see\nare compatible with each other,\n\n189\n00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:18.437\ncuz they operate within\nthe same frequency range.\n\n190\n00:09:18.437 --> 00:09:22.337\nWell here's the thing, there were\nstill a devices on the market and\n\n191\n00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:26.590\nwhen they ratified the 802.11n standard,\nthe big long standard.\n\n192\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.488\nIt's actually called 802.11n\nwith reverse compatibility and\n\n193\n00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:32.609\nall prior legacy protocols, right?\n\n194\n00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:35.922\nI mean a big old long name, it's like wow,\nyou really put that in the name?\n\n195\n00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:40.285\nBut that was the purpose, the purpose was\nsay, we wanna improve performance, but\n\n196\n00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:43.040\nwe also want to support all\nprior legacy protocols.\n\n197\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.466\nSo that we get that inner operability and\ncompatibility, and you don't.\n\n198\n00:09:46.466 --> 00:09:49.526\nAnd I'm glad you mentioned that about\nretooling your whole entire PC,\n\n199\n00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:51.170\nif you were vendor launched.\n\n200\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.490\nBecause now I could use older devices and\njust because N came out, I don't have to\n\n201\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.180\nsay I gotta do this manufacturer, and\nI gotta get this specific device.\n\n202\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.216\nWe have interoperability, right?\n\n203\n00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:05.239\nAnd you can see that also with going\nfurther back to B and G right?\n\n204\n00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:11.215\nNow 802.11c, you will see marketed out\nthere, that it's also a dual band.\n\n205\n00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:12.503\nAnd let me talk about N too,\n\n206\n00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:16.210\nyou could see that it's operating in\nboth 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz.\n\n207\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.086\nThat's why you get\nthe backwards compatibility.\n\n208\n00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:22.830\nAnd notice 802.11ac operates\nin 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n209\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.371\nBe careful with this one, because 802.11ac\ndevices, a lot of times will have a dual\n\n210\n00:10:27.371 --> 00:10:31.638\nband radio in them, that allows them also\nto operate on 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n211\n00:10:31.638 --> 00:10:33.395\nThat's not a part of the standard, okay?\n\n212\n00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:37.931\nThat's just a manufacturer giving you the\nbenefit of backwards compatibility, but\n\n213\n00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:40.144\nit's not part of the official standard.\n\n214\n00:10:40.144 --> 00:10:44.637\nSo AC operates in the 5\ngigahertz spectrum.\n\n215\n00:10:44.637 --> 00:10:48.846\nAll right, so the next thing we're gonna\ntalk about is the range of these devices.\n\n216\n00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:53.365\nAnd when we were talking in our channels\nepisode, one of the things that Dan and\n\n217\n00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:56.994\nI mentioned was the fact that\nwhen you increase the gigahertz,\n\n218\n00:10:56.994 --> 00:10:59.686\nthe frequency level,\nyou shorten the range.\n\n219\n00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:03.080\nYou definitely get better performance out\nof it, but you also shorten the range.\n\n220\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.340\nWhen you lower the frequency level,\nyou get longer distances, but\n\n221\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.070\nyou have the potential\nto get slower speeds.\n\n222\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.302\nAll right, so that's something\nto keep in mind as we move in,\n\n223\n00:11:12.302 --> 00:11:14.116\nwell to the next category speeds.\n\n224\n00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:16.650\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look here and let's talk about,\n\n225\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.351\nwe'll go all the way back in time again.\n\n226\n00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:24.047\nDriving our DeLorean 88.5 miles\nan hour and we'll talk about 802.11a.\n\n227\n00:11:24.047 --> 00:11:28.980\n802.11a, these devices operated\nin the 5 gigahertz spectrum and\n\n228\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.612\nthey got blinding speeds, all right?\n\n229\n00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:34.370\nVery fast speeds for those days.\n\n230\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.972\nB devices operated in the 2.4 gigahertz\nspectrum and were more common.\n\n231\n00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:40.653\nAnd again on the list,\nit hasn't come up yet.\n\n232\n00:11:40.653 --> 00:11:41.481\nBut I'll go ahead and\n\n233\n00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:44.623\nmention one of the reasons they were more\ncommon is cuz they were less expensive.\n\n234\n00:11:44.623 --> 00:11:48.512\nWe don't think about it today, but in\nthe earlier days you could pay $1,000 for\n\n235\n00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:49.710\na wireless access point.\n\n236\n00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.931\nA grand, right?\n\n237\n00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:52.897\nWhere today-\n&gt;&gt; 20\n\n238\n00:11:52.897 --> 00:11:54.205\nbucks on Craigslist\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n239\n00:11:54.205 --> 00:11:56.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about one episode,\n\n240\n00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:57.259\nDan when we wrapped up.\n\n241\n00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:01.175\nDan was like hey, go out to eBay get your\n$10 access point and work with it, so\n\n242\n00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:03.407\nyou don't worry about breaking it, right?\n\n243\n00:12:03.407 --> 00:12:06.604\nSo they're very expensive\nversus the B devices and\n\n244\n00:12:06.604 --> 00:12:10.484\nthat's why people thought that\nthe A devices came out later.\n\n245\n00:12:10.484 --> 00:12:14.123\nIt's not really the case, it's just\nthe fact that corporate entities would get\n\n246\n00:12:14.123 --> 00:12:18.010\nEnterprise entities if you will,\nwould get these devices and why is that?\n\n247\n00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.350\nThey could justify the cost to get\nthe speeds, your average mom and\n\n248\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.750\npop location, they're really couldn't\njustify all that extra expense.\n\n249\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.906\nNow one of the great\nthings is when g came out,\n\n250\n00:12:29.906 --> 00:12:33.991\nnot only did it operate in\nthe 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n251\n00:12:33.991 --> 00:12:36.792\nBut it also did a different\ntype of frequency modulation,\n\n252\n00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:38.288\nwhich is well beyond the exam.\n\n253\n00:12:38.288 --> 00:12:42.887\nThat allowed it not only to operate\nin the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum, but\n\n254\n00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.880\nmaintain the speeds,\nif you will of the earlier A devices.\n\n255\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.122\nNow that's one of the things\nthat kind of all but\n\n256\n00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:51.206\nsignal the death blow to A devices, right?\n\n257\n00:12:51.206 --> 00:12:53.553\nWhy would I spend all of\nthat money on a A device,\n\n258\n00:12:53.553 --> 00:12:56.031\nwhen I can get a relatively\ninexpensive G device.\n\n259\n00:12:56.031 --> 00:13:01.362\nWhich kind of maintain the expense of\nB and I get the performance as well.\n\n260\n00:13:01.362 --> 00:13:08.865\nNow 802.11n all right, you will see all\ndifferent kinds of ratings, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:08.865 --> 00:13:13.305\nThese are theoretical ratings just like we\ntalked about in hard drive speeds, USB,\n\n262\n00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:14.210\nfirewire.\n\n263\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.118\nThis is the theoretical upper end,\n\n264\n00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:19.242\nthey have to put some kind of\ntheoretical standard there.\n\n265\n00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:20.512\n&gt;&gt; Have to draw a line\nin the sand somewhere.\n\n266\n00:13:20.512 --> 00:13:21.503\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir, absolutely.\n\n267\n00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:23.469\nNow whether you can get to\nthe line in the sand or\n\n268\n00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:26.252\nnot is really based on how the vendor\nimplements the technology.\n\n269\n00:13:26.252 --> 00:13:29.416\nWhat I mean by that is, 802.11n devices,\n\n270\n00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:33.515\nthey support something known as\nmultiple in and multiple out.\n\n271\n00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:36.031\nAnd what do I really mean by that, guys?\n\n272\n00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:39.395\nWell, just think about more\nthan one antenna sending and\n\n273\n00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:41.439\nreceiving information, right?\n\n274\n00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:46.915\nVersus the earlier standards which\nmeans I could send information to Dan.\n\n275\n00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:51.023\nAnd Dan would have to wait, and then once\nhe received the information that I'm\n\n276\n00:13:51.023 --> 00:13:53.337\nsending, he could send back to me, right?\n\n277\n00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:56.885\nMultiple in, multiple out,\njust like it's called MIMO.\n\n278\n00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:59.513\nMultiple in means you have\nantennas that can send and\n\n279\n00:13:59.513 --> 00:14:01.374\nreceive across all those antennas.\n\n280\n00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:06.642\nNow the theory behind it is that\neach stream, again each MIMO in and\n\n281\n00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:11.268\nout can support 150 megabit\ntransfer speeds, right?\n\n282\n00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:15.398\nFor maximum in the N standard,\nwhich 4 times 150 I believe is 600,\n\n283\n00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:18.076\nthat's why you got\nthe theoretical upper end.\n\n284\n00:14:18.076 --> 00:14:21.087\nNow what we've also said is\nthat it really depends on how\n\n285\n00:14:21.087 --> 00:14:23.081\nthe manufacturer implements them.\n\n286\n00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:25.979\nBecause a lot of these devices\nweren't implementing four antennas,\n\n287\n00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:27.217\ngiving you the four streams.\n\n288\n00:14:27.217 --> 00:14:31.051\nWhat they would do is they'd implement\nthree antennas for your communications.\n\n289\n00:14:31.051 --> 00:14:34.078\nAnd then one would be for control,\ncommunication, and quality, if you will.\n\n290\n00:14:34.078 --> 00:14:38.902\nSo again depending, you might see some\nthat say, implemented times three, right?\n\n291\n00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:41.021\nWell that's the theoretical\nupper end of 450.\n\n292\n00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:45.061\nAnd again, it doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're gonna get that impracticality, why?\n\n293\n00:14:45.061 --> 00:14:48.991\nIt's wireless communications,\nwe have radio frequency interference.\n\n294\n00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:53.676\nYou're talking about 2.4 gigahertz\nspectrum, you're talking about microwaves,\n\n295\n00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:57.050\ncell phones, cordless phones,\nall of this starts to play in and\n\n296\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.690\nfactoring into what is the actual\nrange and what is the actual speed?\n\n297\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:06.043\nLast but not least, we're talking about\ngigabit speeds, gigabit per second.\n\n298\n00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:08.532\nThat's one of the things about the AC,\n\n299\n00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:12.164\nbecause AC has an upwards of\neight antennas, all right?\n\n300\n00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:14.986\nSo we're talking eight\nsimultaneous streams, and\n\n301\n00:15:14.986 --> 00:15:17.687\nthat's a technically\ncalled multi-user MIMO.\n\n302\n00:15:17.687 --> 00:15:21.191\nIt just means now because we've got\nall these different components on our\n\n303\n00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:25.611\nnetworks, mobile devices, things like Roku\nstreaming media, media servers, Netflix.\n\n304\n00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:28.833\n&gt;&gt; We're just having to make provision for\nall the stuff that's detaching, right?\n\n305\n00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:32.457\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is,\nyou need a lot more fire hoses.\n\n306\n00:15:32.457 --> 00:15:33.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You've got a lot of fires going on your\n\n307\n00:15:33.923 --> 00:15:34.773\nnetwork, just kidding.\n\n308\n00:15:34.773 --> 00:15:39.455\nBut analogy being that you got a lot\nof streams that you gotta pump\n\n309\n00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.023\ninformation out to.\n\n310\n00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:45.849\nAggregating all of those streams gets you\nsomewhere around 1,300 mega bits if you\n\n311\n00:15:45.849 --> 00:15:48.506\nwant the comparison there or\n1.3 giga bits.\n\n312\n00:15:48.506 --> 00:15:50.544\n&gt;&gt; Just remember, never cross the streams.\n\n313\n00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:52.062\n&gt;&gt; That's right, total-\n&gt;&gt; That's an important safety tip.\n\n314\n00:15:52.062 --> 00:15:53.484\n&gt;&gt; Total protonic reversal.\n\n315\n00:15:53.484 --> 00:15:54.779\nThat's right, that's right.\n\n316\n00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.362\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What you do, Ray?\n\n317\n00:15:56.362 --> 00:15:59.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So some of the other things\nwe're gonna talk about, let's go ahead and\n\n318\n00:15:59.971 --> 00:16:01.036\nmove down in the list.\n\n319\n00:16:01.036 --> 00:16:05.372\nAnd we've kinda added some things that\naren't on the exam but should help you out\n\n320\n00:16:05.372 --> 00:16:09.091\nwhen you just talk about making\na decision on what you're gonna buy.\n\n321\n00:16:09.091 --> 00:16:10.736\nDistance is the next thing.\n\n322\n00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.116\nYou're gonna notice something\nkind of interesting here.\n\n323\n00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:18.296\nNotice that when we talk about 802.11a\nwe're talking about ten meters or\n\n324\n00:16:18.296 --> 00:16:20.469\n32.8 feet roughly, right?\n\n325\n00:16:20.469 --> 00:16:22.664\nSo again increasing the frequency,\n\n326\n00:16:22.664 --> 00:16:26.909\nreducing the overall range versus the b\nand the g devices which is kind of\n\n327\n00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:30.687\ninteresting because they kept\nthe spectrum the same, right?\n\n328\n00:16:30.687 --> 00:16:32.073\nThe frequency if you will, but\n\n329\n00:16:32.073 --> 00:16:35.391\nthey changed how the information was\ntravelling across that frequency.\n\n330\n00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:37.930\nI've noticed that we get to 100 meters,\nright?\n\n331\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.979\nOr 328 feet, again give or take.\n\n332\n00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:42.681\n&gt;&gt; No, riddle me this, Batman?\n\n333\n00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:45.222\nI'm looking at your chart here, it's\na lovely chart that you've got going on.\n\n334\n00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:49.531\nYou've got 10 meters on 802.11a,\nwhich is in a 5 GHz range.\n\n335\n00:16:49.531 --> 00:16:52.607\nYou jump to N,\nwhich has 5 GHz capabilities, or\n\n336\n00:16:52.607 --> 00:16:56.517\nAC, which is in 5 GHz, and\nit's blowing it out of the water.\n\n337\n00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:58.592\nHow the heck did they accomplish that?\n\n338\n00:16:58.592 --> 00:16:59.625\n&gt;&gt; You really wanna know?\n\n339\n00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:02.029\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nNo frequency divisional multiplexing.\n\n340\n00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:03.995\n&gt;&gt; Well, you just had to say that.\n\n341\n00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:05.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you, now I know.\n\n342\n00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:10.016\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not something you get in-\n\n343\n00:17:10.016 --> 00:17:12.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:17:12.446 --> 00:17:13.495\n&gt;&gt; Sure it sounds awesome.\n\n345\n00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:17.897\nIt's actually called scalable or\northogonal [CROSSTALK] That's right,\n\n346\n00:17:17.897 --> 00:17:19.180\nyeah, it's a shot.\n\n347\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.155\nIt takes care of things like tetanus.\n\n348\n00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:25.473\n[LAUGH] But in the earlier days\nthey would use a different kind,\n\n349\n00:17:25.473 --> 00:17:28.724\nthey would use something\nknown as FSS I think.\n\n350\n00:17:28.724 --> 00:17:32.372\nIt's frequency spread spectrum,\nfrequency hopping spread spectrum,\n\n351\n00:17:32.372 --> 00:17:35.498\nthey use something known as\ndirect sequence spread spectrum.\n\n352\n00:17:35.498 --> 00:17:38.620\nAnd then G, you'll see that one of\nthe reasons they upped the speeds and\n\n353\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.566\nkept the distances.\n\n354\n00:17:39.566 --> 00:17:41.055\nThey started using that orthogonal\n\n355\n00:17:41.055 --> 00:17:42.096\nfrequency-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n356\n00:17:42.096 --> 00:17:42.753\n&gt;&gt; Divisional multiplexing.\n\n357\n00:17:42.753 --> 00:17:45.648\nAgain, OFDM,\ndo not worry about that on the exam.\n\n358\n00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.349\nIt's well beyond most of\nthe any of the exams.\n\n359\n00:17:48.349 --> 00:17:48.899\n&gt;&gt; I'm already on Google, man.\n\n360\n00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:49.429\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n361\n00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:51.894\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you put out the forbidden fruit.\n\n362\n00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.209\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\ndangle that one out there in front of you.\n\n363\n00:17:54.209 --> 00:17:58.090\nAnd that's really why the way\nthey implement the technologies.\n\n364\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.257\nAnd the same thing with 802.11 AC,\nit just means that every one of\n\n365\n00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:06.988\nthe frequencies are orthogonal, if you\nwill, in relationship to one another.\n\n366\n00:18:06.988 --> 00:18:10.340\nSo again, it doesn't cross the streams\nreally is what it comes down to.\n\n367\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.369\nSo it's a better better performance there.\n\n368\n00:18:12.369 --> 00:18:15.124\nBut again, a little bit more than what\nwe need to know for the exam, but\n\n369\n00:18:15.124 --> 00:18:17.943\nthere nonetheless just in case you\nwanted a mouthful of alphabet soup.\n\n370\n00:18:17.943 --> 00:18:19.906\n[LAUGH] In case you're hungry there.\n\n371\n00:18:19.906 --> 00:18:20.517\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, good.\n\n372\n00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:24.700\n&gt;&gt; A couple other things that I want\nto talk about is the bandwidth, right?\n\n373\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.259\nThe bandwidth here, they operate in\ndifferent bandwidths Again this is\n\n374\n00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:31.657\nthe how wide a single channel will be.\n\n375\n00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:35.159\nAnd sometimes you can aggregate\nmultiple channels together.\n\n376\n00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:39.052\nIt's like taking multiple channels and\nsaying okay we're gonna, now, this entire,\n\n377\n00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:42.543\nyou got four channels are gonna be used\nto send a single communication across.\n\n378\n00:18:42.543 --> 00:18:46.674\nMight be a little bit more than you need\nto know for the exam but hey, we're gonna\n\n379\n00:18:46.674 --> 00:18:50.511\nhave you setup and you guys will know\nwhat's going on with your wireless.\n\n380\n00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:54.582\nYou could see 20 megahertz pretty much\nconsistent across the board all the way up\n\n381\n00:18:54.582 --> 00:18:55.473\nuntil we get to n.\n\n382\n00:18:55.473 --> 00:18:59.118\nN would allow you double that bandwidth,\nright?\n\n383\n00:18:59.118 --> 00:19:01.087\nAnd so, again, better speeds, again,\n\n384\n00:19:01.087 --> 00:19:03.917\nwith the way the information's\ngoing across the network.\n\n385\n00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:07.280\nYou can get better ranges and,\nagain, it would double the bandwidth.\n\n386\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.663\nNow be careful because\none of the things that n,\n\n387\n00:19:09.663 --> 00:19:13.069\nremember we talked about supporting\nbackwards legacy protocols.\n\n388\n00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:17.502\nWhen you support those legacy protocols,\nyou essentially take those 40 bands and\n\n389\n00:19:17.502 --> 00:19:18.946\nyou split them up into two.\n\n390\n00:19:18.946 --> 00:19:22.074\n20 megahertz for\nall your older legacy devices, and\n\n391\n00:19:22.074 --> 00:19:26.633\nthen 20 megahertz dedicated for any of\nthe n devices that are on your network.\n\n392\n00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:31.567\nIf you don't have any old devices,\neverything you have is n or ac even,\n\n393\n00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:34.691\ncuz ac will run over it\nif it's a dual-band,\n\n394\n00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:39.812\none of the things to keep in mind is\nthat you can use 40, 40 megahertz.\n\n395\n00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:42.674\nAnd that pumps all of that\ninformation over that channel.\n\n396\n00:19:42.674 --> 00:19:46.284\nIf you will, at the 40 megahertz,\npotentially giving you better speeds.\n\n397\n00:19:46.284 --> 00:19:52.604\nNow, one of the great things about\nac is ac has scalable frequencies.\n\n398\n00:19:52.604 --> 00:19:56.288\nThey double,\nthey start with ns on a single channel.\n\n399\n00:19:56.288 --> 00:19:59.922\nAnd then you can take two of the channels\ntogether and you can do 80 megahertz and\n\n400\n00:19:59.922 --> 00:20:00.895\neven more than that.\n\n401\n00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:05.508\nYou put four channels together, and you\ncan get 160 MHz and just think about that,\n\n402\n00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:09.697\nis again we're increasing the pipeline\nof a single communication, right?\n\n403\n00:20:09.697 --> 00:20:14.738\n20 MHz, we take two of those channels,\n40 MHz, ac starts at 40 megahertz,\n\n404\n00:20:14.738 --> 00:20:19.434\nand then we double that to 80, and\nthen finally we quadruple it to 160.\n\n405\n00:20:19.434 --> 00:20:21.992\nSo again, 40 times 4, if you will.\n\n406\n00:20:21.992 --> 00:20:26.236\nAgain, keep in mind the level of\nperformance you get is really contingent\n\n407\n00:20:26.236 --> 00:20:28.160\non a lot of interfering factors.\n\n408\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.970\nLast thing I wanted to mention, and\nI've kind of mentioned this, and\n\n409\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.469\nI think this is about the last\nthing you'll really need to know.\n\n410\n00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:38.206\nIt's remember what's compatible, right?\n\n411\n00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:42.122\nBecause its the fact that\nA operates on five gigahertz,\n\n412\n00:20:42.122 --> 00:20:47.789\nit's compatible with n because B and G\nboth operate at two point four gigahertz,\n\n413\n00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.559\nthey're compatible with each other.\n\n414\n00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.733\nBut because n also operates at\n2.4 gigahertz all three of them\n\n415\n00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:55.900\nare compatible.\n\n416\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:01.963\nNotice that 802.11n is the only\nthat is compatible with ac.\n\n417\n00:21:01.963 --> 00:21:06.761\nNow you're probably gonna say well,\nwait a second, a operates in the five\n\n418\n00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:11.636\ngigahertz frequency but it's not using\nthe same method of communication,\n\n419\n00:21:11.636 --> 00:21:14.016\nso it is not supported, if you will.\n\n420\n00:21:14.016 --> 00:21:18.842\nAll right, so that was a laundry list,\nguys and gals out there.\n\n421\n00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:22.976\nAnd I realize it's a lot of specifications\nand some of this stuff is not fun.\n\n422\n00:21:22.976 --> 00:21:25.555\nDo not let it intimidate you, guys.\n\n423\n00:21:25.555 --> 00:21:29.081\nI will tell you, I've got all of this\nrattling around in my brain up here.\n\n424\n00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:32.386\nYou look at it long enough and\nit's getting-\n\n425\n00:21:32.386 --> 00:21:33.024\n&gt;&gt; Pill stick.\n\n426\n00:21:33.024 --> 00:21:34.642\n&gt;&gt; You've said flash cards.\n\n427\n00:21:34.642 --> 00:21:36.944\nThat's one of the best piece of\nadvice anybody can give you for\n\n428\n00:21:36.944 --> 00:21:37.703\nstudying for exam.\n\n429\n00:21:37.703 --> 00:21:38.259\nWrite it down.\n\n430\n00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:41.344\nNow, the last thing that\nwe need to talk about here.\n\n431\n00:21:41.344 --> 00:21:43.876\nWe've got a few more minutes\nis encryption types.\n\n432\n00:21:43.876 --> 00:21:45.782\nNow, they're not going to expect.\n\n433\n00:21:45.782 --> 00:21:48.673\nLet me say what you're not\ngonna be expected to do.\n\n434\n00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:51.590\nYou're not gonna be expected to work for\nthe NSA, right?\n\n435\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.715\nYou're not gonna be expected\nto have a CIA level, MIT-\n\n436\n00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:56.519\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to be Bruce Schneier.\n\n437\n00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:58.754\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nyou don't have to be Bruce Schneier,\n\n438\n00:21:58.754 --> 00:22:02.011\nyou don't need to be Whitfield Diffie or\nMarty Hellman out there or Ron Rivest,\n\n439\n00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:03.921\nthey've got all these\ncrazy security gurus.\n\n440\n00:22:03.921 --> 00:22:08.314\nBut what you will have to know is to make\nan intelligent choice on what type of\n\n441\n00:22:08.314 --> 00:22:13.158\nencryption you're gonna use and why you\nwould use one over the other, all right?\n\n442\n00:22:13.158 --> 00:22:15.854\nSo as you progress through\nyour CompTIA training,\n\n443\n00:22:15.854 --> 00:22:19.237\nmaybe you're gonna go on the path\nof Network+, Security+ and\n\n444\n00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:22.824\nthen maybe CSA+ after that,\nyou're gonna have to know a lot more.\n\n445\n00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:26.360\nHere at the A+ level, and it's certainly\nnot demeaning anything about A+ but\n\n446\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.814\nunderstand since it's entry level you\nkind of got to know some of the basics.\n\n447\n00:22:29.814 --> 00:22:32.735\nAnd that's really what we wanna discuss\nhere in the last few minutes of\n\n448\n00:22:32.735 --> 00:22:33.387\nthis episode.\n\n449\n00:22:33.387 --> 00:22:35.441\nLet's talk about encryption types.\n\n450\n00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:39.778\nSo I got some of the encryption types,\nactually I got the encryption types that\n\n451\n00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:42.620\nthey call out and\nI got one extra one, that is here.\n\n452\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.017\nActually you know what?\n\n453\n00:22:44.017 --> 00:22:44.737\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n454\n00:22:44.737 --> 00:22:47.604\nI've got one that isn't,\nthat's suppose to be here and isn't.\n\n455\n00:22:47.604 --> 00:22:50.688\nAnd we'll put that one right\nthere at the end, AES, okay?\n\n456\n00:22:50.688 --> 00:22:53.195\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about these, all right?\n\n457\n00:22:53.195 --> 00:22:57.909\nWhen we talk about encryption types, the\nvery first encryption type that the IEEE\n\n458\n00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:01.942\nstandardized for wireless communications\nthat came out with the a and\n\n459\n00:23:01.942 --> 00:23:06.206\nb standard was something known as\nwired equivalent privacy, all right?\n\n460\n00:23:06.206 --> 00:23:08.509\nWired equivalent privacy,\nif you're not aware,\n\n461\n00:23:08.509 --> 00:23:11.507\nif this is the first time you're\nreally hearing about networks you\n\n462\n00:23:11.507 --> 00:23:15.323\nhave to understand that there really isn't\nany privacy on a wired network, right?\n\n463\n00:23:15.323 --> 00:23:18.263\nBut I want you to think,\nlet's say the facility here at IT Pro TV.\n\n464\n00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:21.893\nIf you're standing outside of the building\nand you have no access, right?\n\n465\n00:23:21.893 --> 00:23:25.035\nYou have zero access inside of\nthis building to get access to our\n\n466\n00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:28.176\nwired network outside of hacking,\nyou would have to come in and\n\n467\n00:23:28.176 --> 00:23:29.794\nplug into the network, right?\n\n468\n00:23:29.794 --> 00:23:34.833\nBut once you plug into the network, unless\nwe are encrypting the communication,\n\n469\n00:23:34.833 --> 00:23:37.835\nscrambling it,\nwe have no privacy, all right?\n\n470\n00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:40.768\nSo that's why they say wired\nequivalent privacy and\n\n471\n00:23:40.768 --> 00:23:44.829\nwhen it comes to the security levels of\nit I really want you to think of it as\n\n472\n00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:47.110\nmaybe pulling the shades down, right?\n\n473\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.630\nShutting your windows in your house and\npulling the shades down so\n\n474\n00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.086\nthat the casual person that's\nwalking their dog by your house,\n\n475\n00:23:54.086 --> 00:23:56.839\ncan't look in your window\nto see what's going on.\n\n476\n00:23:56.839 --> 00:24:00.433\nHowever, if that person is\na trained criminal, that door,\n\n477\n00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:03.260\nthat window isn't stopping anybody, right?\n\n478\n00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.302\nIf they really get in there, they could\nbreak the window, do whatever they want,\n\n479\n00:24:07.302 --> 00:24:08.780\nfool with the alarm, right?\n\n480\n00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.090\nSo, wired equivalent privacy had many,\n\n481\n00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.640\nmany flaws that we don't need\nto go in here at this point.\n\n482\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.585\nBut it was weak, all right?\n\n483\n00:24:18.585 --> 00:24:21.357\nSo it wasn't a one size fits all.\n\n484\n00:24:21.357 --> 00:24:24.177\nIn fact, the IEEE, when they released WIP,\n\n485\n00:24:24.177 --> 00:24:29.164\nthey released it as a temporary stopgap\nfor absolutely no protection, right?\n\n486\n00:24:29.164 --> 00:24:32.743\nAnd so, what they did is they\nwent to the books, all right?\n\n487\n00:24:32.743 --> 00:24:37.067\nUnderstand that in Wi-Fi communications,\nyou have a group of manufacturers that\n\n488\n00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:41.580\nhave created this consortium,\nif you will, called the Wi-Fi Alliance.\n\n489\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.083\nIt's all different types of wireless\nmanufacturers and they got together and\n\n490\n00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.524\nthey promote their standards.\n\n491\n00:24:46.524 --> 00:24:50.075\nAnd there's certain things that you have\nto implement within the products you\n\n492\n00:24:50.075 --> 00:24:53.732\nmanufacture to get that nice Wi-Fi trusted\nlogo stamped on the side of the device\n\n493\n00:24:53.732 --> 00:24:54.780\nthat you're making.\n\n494\n00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.335\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a cabal.\n\n495\n00:24:55.335 --> 00:24:57.544\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n496\n00:24:57.544 --> 00:24:58.913\nHe was my-\n&gt;&gt; The wireless cabal.\n\n497\n00:24:58.913 --> 00:25:02.019\n&gt;&gt; That's right, he was my favorite\ncharacter in Mortal Kombat\n\n498\n00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:02.614\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n499\n00:25:02.614 --> 00:25:05.122\n&gt;&gt; We're gamers around here, [LAUGH].\n\n500\n00:25:05.122 --> 00:25:09.058\nSo the Wi-Fi Alliance went to the IEEE and\nthey're like hey guys,\n\n501\n00:25:09.058 --> 00:25:10.973\nthis isn't stopping anybody.\n\n502\n00:25:10.973 --> 00:25:13.555\nWe need something,\nIEEE is like we know and\n\n503\n00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:19.120\nwe're working on it that's what we're\ndoing what was never supposed to be.\n\n504\n00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.539\n&gt;&gt; The one size fits all, right?\n\n505\n00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:23.123\nOther companies like Cisco came\nout with something known as Leap.\n\n506\n00:25:23.123 --> 00:25:27.395\nIt was a very small, temporary protocol\nthat they implemented within their\n\n507\n00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:30.120\nnetworks because they\nknew WEP wasn't good.\n\n508\n00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.475\nSo the IEEE says okay, well you know what?\n\n509\n00:25:32.475 --> 00:25:35.267\nWe've got part of the standard\nthat we're working on right now,\n\n510\n00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:37.110\nwe've got some of the nuts and bolts here.\n\n511\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.255\nHow about we'll give you that now, just so\n\n512\n00:25:39.255 --> 00:25:41.838\nyou have something until\nwe finish this standard?\n\n513\n00:25:41.838 --> 00:25:48.043\nSo the Wi-Fi Alliance grabs this early,\nif you will, pre-draft components,\n\n514\n00:25:48.043 --> 00:25:53.537\nand they release it out of something\nknown as Wi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n515\n00:25:53.537 --> 00:25:57.017\nNow, Wi-Fi Protected Access does\nsomething kinda interesting.\n\n516\n00:25:57.017 --> 00:26:00.984\nYou will see that there is another\nset of [LAUGH] acronyms up here.\n\n517\n00:26:00.984 --> 00:26:05.729\nWhat Wi-Fi Protected Access did is it\ntook the WEP encryption technology and\n\n518\n00:26:05.729 --> 00:26:08.220\nit wrapped it in a temporal key, right?\n\n519\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.690\nKey is a modifier to an encryption\nthat makes it unique to us.\n\n520\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.663\nAnd that's where TKIP comes in.\n\n521\n00:26:13.663 --> 00:26:16.400\nThat's the temporal key\nintegrity protocol.\n\n522\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.407\nIt just basically means that if\nI've got this encryption key,\n\n523\n00:26:19.407 --> 00:26:23.388\nif I've got this component that allows me\nto modify the way the data's scrambled.\n\n524\n00:26:23.388 --> 00:26:28.211\nIf that doesn't change it gives\nhackers all the time they need\n\n525\n00:26:28.211 --> 00:26:30.910\nto essentially break it, right?\n\n526\n00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.070\nYou can think of a key as a passphrase,\na password, right?\n\n527\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.828\nWell, what temporal key integral protocol\ndoes is it says hay, let's go ahead and\n\n528\n00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:42.273\nlet's put this on the chopping block and\nlet's chop it up into many pieces.\n\n529\n00:26:42.273 --> 00:26:44.709\nAnd what we'll do is we'll\ntake a unique key or\n\n530\n00:26:44.709 --> 00:26:49.081\npassphrase that you don't really have to\nimplement for every individual block and\n\n531\n00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:51.087\nwe'll keep rotating through those.\n\n532\n00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.866\nAgain, the thought process is anything\nthat is ephemeral, it doesn't last for\n\n533\n00:26:55.866 --> 00:26:56.869\na long time, right?\n\n534\n00:26:56.869 --> 00:27:00.520\nIt doesn't give a hacker enough\ntime to guess what it is.\n\n535\n00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.592\nAnd if they happen to,\nit would've already changed, right?\n\n536\n00:27:03.592 --> 00:27:07.120\nSo it was a temporal,\nyeah just a temporary thing, right?\n\n537\n00:27:08.588 --> 00:27:12.974\nWell, the Wi-Fi Alliance, or not\nthe WiFi Alliance, I'm sorry, the IEEE,\n\n538\n00:27:12.974 --> 00:27:16.257\nthey finished the standard that\nthey were busy working on.\n\n539\n00:27:16.257 --> 00:27:20.570\nWell, when they finished it,\nthey released it out as 802.11i, right?\n\n540\n00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:24.890\nThat is the wireless encryption standard,\nand we still use it today.\n\n541\n00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:28.283\nThat's our wireless encryption standard\nthat we use today, and it's been safe for\n\n542\n00:27:28.283 --> 00:27:29.011\na very long time.\n\n543\n00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:31.730\nNow Wi-Fi Alliance is a manufacturer,\nright?\n\n544\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.199\nThey're a consortium of manufacturers,\nright?\n\n545\n00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:36.420\nWhat we've talked about manufacturers,\nit's a numbers and marketing game.\n\n546\n00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.380\nSo people already recognized WPA\ncuz it was released prior to that.\n\n547\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.530\nSo they said, you know what?\n\n548\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.070\nokay, it's 802.11i standard but\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n549\n00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.562\njust release them with\na marketing name of WPA 2, right?\n\n550\n00:27:45.562 --> 00:27:47.970\nIt's the successor.\n\n551\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.821\nThey're the same.\n\n552\n00:27:48.821 --> 00:27:50.890\nLadies and gentlemen,\ndon't let that fool you.\n\n553\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:56.714\nIf you see WPA2 on your exam or\n802.11i, talking about the same thing.\n\n554\n00:27:56.714 --> 00:27:59.560\nDon't let it confuse you guys and\ngals out there, okay?\n\n555\n00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.680\nNow what happens here?\n\n556\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.908\nWell TKIP in and\n\n557\n00:28:01.908 --> 00:28:07.770\nof itself these brilliant people out\nthere found ways to get around it.\n\n558\n00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.379\nAnd it was using an earlier\nencryption algorithm,\n\n559\n00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:14.153\na mathematical operation applied to\nyour data that was relatively weak.\n\n560\n00:28:14.153 --> 00:28:16.580\nSo they said we can't use that anymore,\nright?\n\n561\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.375\nWe need to get something to replace it.\n\n562\n00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:22.757\nSo they replaced it with AES,\nthe advanced encryption standard.\n\n563\n00:28:22.757 --> 00:28:27.533\nAnd by the way, advanced encryption\nstandard today is the DOD's formal\n\n564\n00:28:27.533 --> 00:28:30.910\nstandard for\ntop secret classified information.\n\n565\n00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:35.065\nSo very, very strong protocol,\nor strong encryption algorithm.\n\n566\n00:28:35.065 --> 00:28:40.566\nNow I want you to know that WPA2\ngives you access to AES, right?\n\n567\n00:28:40.566 --> 00:28:45.244\nA stronger algorithm that helps to\nencrypt that and keep it more secure so\n\n568\n00:28:45.244 --> 00:28:50.153\nthat it's confidential and people\ncannot eavesdrop on that information if\n\n569\n00:28:50.153 --> 00:28:55.385\nit's being sent between two authorized\npartners or communication endpoints.\n\n570\n00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:59.020\nTKIP was replaced with something\nknown as CCMP, all right?\n\n571\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.591\nCCMP again is the successor to TKIP.\n\n572\n00:29:02.591 --> 00:29:07.524\nReally all I want you to known but keep\nin mind if you are configuring wireless\n\n573\n00:29:07.524 --> 00:29:11.910\naccess points within your networks,\ndo not use WEP, all right?\n\n574\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.430\nAt the very least.\n\n575\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:20.110\nAt the very least use WPA, but even that\nI would say don't use WPA, use WPA2.\n\n576\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.963\nAll your modern access\npoints support it and\n\n577\n00:29:22.963 --> 00:29:25.824\nit's something that you should consider.\n\n578\n00:29:25.824 --> 00:29:30.223\nLast thing I wanna mention down here,\nI know we got a just couple more minutes,\n\n579\n00:29:30.223 --> 00:29:34.220\nis there are two different kinds of WPA,\nWPA2 modes, all right?\n\n580\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.480\nAnd it's for both WPA and WPA2.\n\n581\n00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.160\nYou have what's known as personal mode and\nyou have what's known as enterprise mode.\n\n582\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.024\nI want you to realize that that's\nsomething that's associated with WPA and\n\n583\n00:29:46.024 --> 00:29:46.560\nWPA2.\n\n584\n00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.100\nPersonal mode, let's take all of\nthe technical jargon out of it.\n\n585\n00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.337\nIt's a password.\n\n586\n00:29:52.337 --> 00:29:55.040\nIt's very common, very easy to implement.\n\n587\n00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.530\nOne of the most common implementations on\nSOHOs, as well as wireless access points.\n\n588\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.342\nIn fact we used the personal mode here.\n\n589\n00:30:03.342 --> 00:30:06.277\nHowever, if you're a large corporation and\n\n590\n00:30:06.277 --> 00:30:12.084\nan enterprise you might have computers\nwithin your network That say, that's Dan.\n\n591\n00:30:12.084 --> 00:30:14.682\nHe put his user name and\npassword in, I recognised him,\n\n592\n00:30:14.682 --> 00:30:17.120\nhe can connect to the network.\n\n593\n00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.280\nWes, I don't know who you are so\nyou can't connect to the network.\n\n594\n00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.142\nSo Enterprise Mode takes those type\nof technologies that we log into and\n\n595\n00:30:25.142 --> 00:30:29.439\nassociates and integrates it in\nwith your wireless networks,\n\n596\n00:30:29.439 --> 00:30:32.170\nthe ability to join that network.\n\n597\n00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.750\nI can't just add a pass phrase,\nI actually have to type the user name and\n\n598\n00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.451\npassword and the access point itself\nthat the wireless router says,\n\n599\n00:30:39.451 --> 00:30:42.819\nhere is that information their computer,\ncan you check that out?\n\n600\n00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:46.920\nCuz I know you have the information to\ntell me whether this is good or not.\n\n601\n00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.690\nAnd if it is, I'll let them on.\n\n602\n00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.460\nAnd if it isn't,\nI'm not going to let you on, right?\n\n603\n00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.944\nSo it's a lot of extra infrastructure.\n\n604\n00:30:51.944 --> 00:30:53.900\nHence the reason they call it Enterprise.\n\n605\n00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.286\nMost common one that you have inside\nyour home networks today is going to be\n\n606\n00:30:58.286 --> 00:30:59.000\npersonal.\n\n607\n00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.920\nNow a lot of different wireless\ntechnology is wireless standards, guys.\n\n608\n00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.080\nKeep in mind some of the things that\nwe've been talking about in this episode.\n\n609\n00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.764\nBecause specifications are important,\n\n610\n00:31:07.764 --> 00:31:11.221\nyou could get questions in a situation or\na scenario.\n\n611\n00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:14.617\nOr they might even give you\na performance-based simulation\n\n612\n00:31:14.617 --> 00:31:19.500\nthat says you have to implement strong\nsecurity on your wireless access point.\n\n613\n00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.418\nAnd you have to know, I don't grad WEP and\nput it in the list, right?\n\n614\n00:31:23.418 --> 00:31:26.241\nI grab WPA2 and I set that in the list.\n\n615\n00:31:26.241 --> 00:31:30.622\nSo there are advantages to this,\nnot only for the certification, but\n\n616\n00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.960\nalso in the real world as well.\n\n617\n00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.522\nAnd if you aren't in\na certification endeavor,\n\n618\n00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:36.857\nmaybe you're just trying to do this for\nyour own personal edification.\n\n619\n00:31:36.857 --> 00:31:38.632\nWe hope by the end of this episode,\n\n620\n00:31:38.632 --> 00:31:42.200\nyou're gonna be able to implement\nthis inside of your own networks.\n\n621\n00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.084\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wesley.\nGreat job on giving us the rundown on\n\n622\n00:31:44.084 --> 00:31:46.870\nthe different standards and\nspecifications therein.\n\n623\n00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.691\nAs well as some of the encryption\ntypes that we might run into and\n\n624\n00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:52.578\nknowing which one we might actually\nwant to use versus another.\n\n625\n00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:55.580\nThat being said, Wes,\nyou are correct, we are out of time.\n\n626\n00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.636\nThis episode we do thank our audience for\nwatching, definitely come back for more.\n\n627\n00:31:58.636 --> 00:32:01.730\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n628\n00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.510\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n629\n00:32:03.510 -->

00:00:11.929\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.729\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.155\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.534\nI'm you're host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.397\nin today's episode we do thank you for\njoining us.\n\n8\n00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:22.257\nBecause we're kicking off\nmore in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.257 --> 00:00:26.460\nAnd of course, joining us back in studio,\nwhen I say us, I mean you,\n\n10\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.136\nmyself and Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:28.782\n&gt;&gt; Hey, hey.\n\n12\n00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:29.792\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.483\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, Dan,\nthanks for jumping in here.\n\n14\n00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.636\nIt is great to be here in studio two,\nthat's right,\n\n15\n00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:38.090\nwe just told you where we were,\nin case you didn't know.\n\n16\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.746\nWe are moving along just\nlike Dan said with A+.\n\n17\n00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:45.837\nAnd we've kinda moved a little bit out\nof the the hardware side, if you will.\n\n18\n00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.566\nWe will be talking more about\nnetworking components and\n\n19\n00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:52.640\nsome of the concepts behind networking,\nif you've been following along with us.\n\n20\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.280\nIf you're just joining us now,\nyou might say, well,\n\n21\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.045\nwhat is this hardware you speak of?\n\n22\n00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.725\nKeep in mind we have quite a few\nepisodes when it comes to dealing with\n\n23\n00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.515\nthe different components that\nare inside of your system unit.\n\n24\n00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:04.665\nAnd make up the entire\ncomputing experience for us.\n\n25\n00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.545\nBut now what we've been diving in\nover the last couple episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:12.450\nWe've really been talking about some of\nthe concepts behind how we communicate\n\n27\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.920\nwithin networks today.\n\n28\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.380\nRemember, very basically,\na network is really for two things, right?\n\n29\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.150\nIt's for sharing resources and\ncommunication.\n\n30\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.132\nNow there are all different\ntypes of networks.\n\n31\n00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:26.740\nAnd in later episodes, we're gonna\ntalk about geographical locations and\n\n32\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.052\nthe network classifications,\nI guess you would say,\n\n33\n00:01:30.052 --> 00:01:33.560\nrelated to how they're dispersed,\nif you will.\n\n34\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.826\nBut, in this episode, what we're gonna\nbe talking about is the small office,\n\n35\n00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.696\nhome office, wireless, and wire routers.\n\n36\n00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:43.685\nAnd we're gonna talk a little bit about\nsome of the concepts that these devices\n\n37\n00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.498\nallow us to perform within these networks.\n\n38\n00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:50.040\nNow remember, when we say SOHO network,\nwe're talking about a small office,\n\n39\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.870\nhome office.\n\n40\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.616\nYou'll see that there are different\ntypes of businesses that\n\n41\n00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:56.743\nthey classify when you start talking\nabout getting into networking.\n\n42\n00:01:56.743 --> 00:01:59.186\nAll right, the smallest one is the SOHO,\nand then you move up from there.\n\n43\n00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:04.230\nYou might hear the term SMB,\nwhich is small to medium business.\n\n44\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.430\nAnd then you have enterprise\nlevel networks, right?\n\n45\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.084\nEnterprise level networks can have\nthousands of employees, if you will,\n\n46\n00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:13.566\nversus, again, small to medium and\nthen, last but not least, SOHO.\n\n47\n00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.280\nNow, with the Soho environment, keep in\nmind that we're typically talking no more\n\n48\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.130\nthan ten computers, ten computers max.\n\n49\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.310\nIf you've ever been to a doctor's office\nbefore, and you've seen maybe, and\n\n50\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.900\nwhen I say doctor's office, I'm certainly\nnot talking about a medical facility,\n\n51\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.890\njust a normal doctor's office.\n\n52\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.890\nYou might see about, what?\n\n53\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.100\nMaybe ten computers there?\n\n54\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.880\nMaybe a couple of receptionists up front,\nif you will, and\n\n55\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.940\nsome of the nurses log in\nto different computers.\n\n56\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.170\nNow, there are certain types of\ndevices that we have to be aware of\n\n57\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.280\nthat help networks, if you will,\nin general, function.\n\n58\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.100\nAnd we're gonna be talking\nabout wireless routers.\n\n59\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.510\nAnd we're gonna talk a little\nbit about wired routers too.\n\n60\n00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.370\nAnd some of the configurations,\nin technologies,\n\n61\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.910\nthat are really built into these devices.\n\n62\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.690\nNow one of the first things\nthat they call out, and\n\n63\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.610\nthis is gonna be really specifically.\n\n64\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.400\nThis is gonna be more\non the wireless side.\n\n65\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.870\nWhat we wanna do is we wanna\ntalk about wireless channels,\n\n66\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.210\nwireless communication, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.110\nNow, when we talk about wireless,\n\n68\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.760\nkeep in mind that we're talking\nabout an unbounded communication.\n\n69\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.870\nAnd wireless really has a lot of benefits.\n\n70\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.940\nOne of the things is, strategic\npositioning can be a little bit better of\n\n71\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.500\nyour devices within your networks.\n\n72\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.570\nIf you have physical limitations, like\nhey, I can't just go over to a wall and\n\n73\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.780\nknock a wall down and then put down my CAT\ncables that we've talked about before.\n\n74\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.280\nSo again, it does have its benefit.\n\n75\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.260\nAnd the other thing is mobility, that's\none of the most prevalent technologies.\n\n76\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.035\nWe wanna be mobile, right?\n\n77\n00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:43.740\nWe don't wanna just necessarily be\nlocked down to a single location.\n\n78\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.900\nSo remember wireless is a very,\nvery common thing to have.\n\n79\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.130\nNot only in SOHO,\nsmall office home office,\n\n80\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.629\nbut even in things like relatively\nshort business type environments.\n\n81\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.889\nNow, we should talk about radiated energy,\nunbounded communications.\n\n82\n00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.680\nAnd when we talk about that, we're really\ntalking about frequencies, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.479\nAnd there are a couple of different\ntypes of frequencies that we really\n\n84\n00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.150\nwanna call out.\n\n85\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.810\nNow, on the exam they call out channels,\nall right?\n\n86\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.600\nBut to understand channels,\nyou really have to understand\n\n87\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.420\nthe frequencies that these channels\noperate on, if that makes sense, right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.190\nBecause we have different channels for\ndifferent frequencies, right?\n\n89\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.230\nWe can't really just lump them all\ntogether, and what you choose is\n\n90\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.850\nbased on compatibility, based on\nthe standard that you have, right?\n\n91\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.170\nAnd you might choose one over the other,\n\n92\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.200\nbecause there are standards out there\nthat support multiple frequencies.\n\n93\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.378\nAnd what I mean by that is we have\nwhat's known as the ISM band.\n\n94\n00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:37.858\nAnd that's a band that's been around for\n\n95\n00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:39.723\na very long time, and\nit's basically unlicensed.\n\n96\n00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Flintstones, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\n\n97\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.152\nlonger than the Flintstones even, right?\n\n98\n00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The ISM band is an unlicensed\n\n99\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.975\nband.\n\n100\n00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:50.009\nAgain, it was released to\nthe public by the FCC.\n\n101\n00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.924\nAnd I honestly don't know the time frame,\nI know it's been out there for a while.\n\n102\n00:04:52.924 --> 00:04:56.880\nBecause things like cellphones, the\ncordless phones that you have out there,\n\n103\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.365\nbluetooth, wireless communications\nthat we're gonna talk about,\n\n104\n00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:04.046\nhere, as well, all operate in what's\nknown as the 2.4 GHz spectrum.\n\n105\n00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:08.057\nNow, when I say a spectrum, understand\nwhat I'm talking about is not just\n\n106\n00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:11.381\na single frequency, but\nin actually a range of frequencies.\n\n107\n00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.933\nAnd when we talk about 2.4,\nwhat we're talking about is there\n\n108\n00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:20.750\nare different channels inside of\nthis larger domain, if you will.\n\n109\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.310\nAgain, commonly called a spectrum.\n\n110\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.398\nNow let's go ahead and let's talk a little\nbit about when it comes to those channels.\n\n111\n00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:34.160\nLet's talk a little bit about\nthat 2.4 GHz spectrum, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.920\nAnd what we mean by that is,\nwhen you have a wireless device,\n\n113\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.280\na mobile device or our laptops here that\nDan and I have, your tablets, if you will.\n\n114\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.852\nAnd you connect to a wireless network, you\nhave the choice to either connect to a 2.4\n\n115\n00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:50.760\nGHz network, and, more common today, also\na 5 GHz network and, well, sometimes both.\n\n116\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.862\nSo why would I choose one over the other?\n\n117\n00:05:52.862 --> 00:05:55.450\nThat's kinda one of the things that\nwe wanna alleviate here if you're\n\n118\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.700\na little bit confused about that.\n\n119\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.090\nAnd if you've never heard about it at all,\n\n120\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.310\nat least you just kinda\nacclimate you to the technology.\n\n121\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.190\nSo starting with 2.4 GHz,\nI've got a little diagram here.\n\n122\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.000\nAnd one of the great things is,\nI don't know that you're gonna have to,\n\n123\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.590\non the A+ exam,\nknow the individual specifics.\n\n124\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.049\nBut we put them here anyways,\njust so you guys could study it.\n\n125\n00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:15.784\nAnd those of you that\nare moving onto Network+,\n\n126\n00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:20.900\nthis information might be just as valuable\nto you as well, so do keep that in mind.\n\n127\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.700\nNow you'll see that these channels here,\nand I'll explain kinda what's going on\n\n128\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.120\nwith this spaghetti that we\nhave up on the screen here.\n\n129\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.580\nYou'll notice that there are 11 channels,\nand 11 channels, essentially,\n\n130\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.860\nare individual frequencies that we have.\n\n131\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.676\nSo the 2.4 GHz spectrum,\nit starts at 2.4 or 2.24,\n\n132\n00:06:38.676 --> 00:06:42.294\nI'm gonna get this right now, 2412 MHz.\n\n133\n00:06:42.294 --> 00:06:46.660\nSo MHz in each channel bumps itself up.\n\n134\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.591\nLike the next channel from channel one,\nchannel one starts out at 200,\n\n135\n00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:55.440\nagain, I'll get this right eventually,\n2412 MHz.\n\n136\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.100\nThe second channel,\nit's just a little bit higher than that.\n\n137\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.600\nStill in that overall broad spectrum\nof 2.4 GHz, if you will, but\n\n138\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.690\nI believe it's 2.417.\n\n139\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.320\nAnd you can see that every channel\njust differs in its MHz just slightly.\n\n140\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.410\nNow, inside of the 2.4 GHz spectrum,\nI said there are 11 channels.\n\n141\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.860\nLet me be a little bit more specific.\n\n142\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.718\nThere's actually 14 channels,\nhowever, the FCC heavily regulates\n\n143\n00:07:20.718 --> 00:07:25.160\nthe amount of channels that we have\navailable to us here in the states.\n\n144\n00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.760\nOther countries also use channels 12, 13,\n\n145\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.560\nand I think Japan's the only one\nthat actually allocates 14 for use.\n\n146\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.054\nIn fact, I think it's one of the only\ncountries that uses channel 14.\n\n147\n00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:39.122\nSo we're not worried about those\nchannels 12 through 14 for the exam.\n\n148\n00:07:39.122 --> 00:07:45.046\nAnd that's why, on this diagram right\nhere, I said outside of the US FCC, right?\n\n149\n00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:50.078\nOur Federal Communications Commission that\nactually overseas this unlicensed band and\n\n150\n00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:52.265\nkinda dictates where we go with it.\n\n151\n00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:55.853\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, what is the purpose of\nhaving all these multiple channels?\n\n152\n00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:59.631\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, because\nwhen you have wireless communications,\n\n153\n00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:03.597\nI want you to think of the old Party\nlines, right, or a conference call, right?\n\n154\n00:08:03.597 --> 00:08:05.545\nIf you have too many people\non a single channel,\n\n155\n00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:08.530\nwhat happens is you get what's known\nas signal congestion, all right.\n\n156\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.310\nAnd signal congestion just means that hey,\nwe got too many people on one pipeline and\n\n157\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.690\nthat pipeline's getting full, right?\n\n158\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.176\nAnd then you have things like radio\nfrequency interference that also comes\n\n159\n00:08:19.176 --> 00:08:19.895\ninto play.\n\n160\n00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:24.040\nSo to answer your question there,\nDan, you can use multiple channels.\n\n161\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.860\nHowever, there are some recommendations\nwhen it comes to which channels you use.\n\n162\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.300\nNotice that there are some\ngreen channels here.\n\n163\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.510\nAnd I just did this to kinda make\nthem stand out from the rest of them.\n\n164\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.951\nWell, what are we talking about\nwhen we say there's green channels?\n\n165\n00:08:35.951 --> 00:08:41.862\nWell, inside of the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum\nthere are three non-overlapping channels,\n\n166\n00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:42.625\nall right?\n\n167\n00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.570\nWell, what do I mean by that?\n\n168\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.411\nWell, let's say that's\nsomebody is on channel 1 and\n\n169\n00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:49.088\nthen somebody is on channel 2.\n\n170\n00:08:49.088 --> 00:08:52.176\nNotice that the bandwidth,\nthey kinda overlap with each other.\n\n171\n00:08:52.176 --> 00:08:55.849\nAnd like I said, that can lead to things\nlike radio frequency interference,\n\n172\n00:08:55.849 --> 00:08:59.126\ncongestion, and you could start\nsee the degradation of the signal,\n\n173\n00:08:59.126 --> 00:09:01.170\nthe performance, if you will.\n\n174\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.980\nSo what they recommend is to\nset your device on a channel\n\n175\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.239\nthat doesn't overlap with an adjacent\nchannel, right, for the purposes\n\n176\n00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:15.780\nof getting a little bit better\nperformance within your communications.\n\n177\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.441\nAll right, so I want you to remember that\nthe three non-overlapping channels that\n\n178\n00:09:20.441 --> 00:09:24.580\nyou have within our spectrum here in\nthe United States is 1, 6 and 11.\n\n179\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.697\nAnd that's because I believe that\nthe channels are 22 megahertz wide,\n\n180\n00:09:27.697 --> 00:09:28.960\nI believe is what they are.\n\n181\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.880\nAnd with that, that full 22 megahertz,\n\n182\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.610\nwhat you'll see is that 1 and\n6 do not overlap with each other.\n\n183\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.210\nNow do you have to set\nthis on your access point?\n\n184\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.070\nA lot of times you don't,\nand let me tell you why.\n\n185\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.648\nBecause your access points support\nwhat's known as autoswitching.\n\n186\n00:09:44.648 --> 00:09:46.720\nThey can actually sense it,\nthey can detect it.\n\n187\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.115\nAnd if they say, wait a second here,\n\n188\n00:09:48.115 --> 00:09:51.540\nwe're getting a lot of congestion,\nthey can flip over to an adjacent channel.\n\n189\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.945\nSo sometimes you'll see that it does\nkinda like a frequency hopping,\n\n190\n00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:58.582\neven though it's not technically\nfrequency hopping, spread spectrum,\n\n191\n00:09:58.582 --> 00:10:00.677\nwhich is another technology altogether.\n\n192\n00:10:00.677 --> 00:10:05.050\nIt does have the ability to\nmove between those frequencies.\n\n193\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.880\nAnd that's something\nimportant to remember.\n\n194\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.390\nNow there is a benefit to\nthe 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n195\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.176\nAnd just like anything that we've been\ntalking down through this entire episode,\n\n196\n00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:16.103\nthere's always gonna be some\nkind of drawback, right?\n\n197\n00:10:16.103 --> 00:10:16.887\n&gt;&gt; Always gives and takes, right?\n\n198\n00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:18.086\nPros and cons, as they say.\n\n199\n00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:19.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n200\n00:10:19.373 --> 00:10:22.658\nAnd one of those pros is the fact\nthat 2.4 gigahertz spectrum,\n\n201\n00:10:22.658 --> 00:10:24.280\nit's got a wide range, right?\n\n202\n00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.070\nIt's a very, very wide range, all right.\n\n203\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.860\nAnd that's kind of one of the things\nthat you have to remember in wireless.\n\n204\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.130\nThe more powerful your signal,\nthe shorter the range.\n\n205\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.040\nLower the power a little bit,\nyou get a farther range.\n\n206\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.870\nAnd I know that sounds kind of,\nwell, wait a second,\n\n207\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.610\nthat sounds kinda counterintuitive.\n\n208\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.670\nBut you gotta keep in mind, just because\nyou put more electrical energy into\n\n209\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.352\nsomething doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're gonna get a clearer signal.\n\n210\n00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.790\nJust means you're gonna\nput more power in it.\n\n211\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.380\nAnd when you put more power, guess what?\n\n212\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.780\nYou also have the chance for increased\nradio frequency interference, so again,\n\n213\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.023\nit's always a give and take.\n\n214\n00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:54.888\nAnd thank goodness,\nthis isn't an electrical science class,\n\n215\n00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:56.595\nbecause it's well beyond me, guys.\n\n216\n00:10:56.595 --> 00:10:58.255\nBut just kinda understand that.\n\n217\n00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:01.195\nAll right, now, here's the thing.\n\n218\n00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:05.665\nEven though the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum\nhas a wide range, it's heavily congested.\n\n219\n00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.695\nAnd why is that?\n\n220\n00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:08.895\nWell, because it's on license,\nall your manufacturers,\n\n221\n00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:11.655\nmicrowaves operate in\nthe 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n222\n00:11:11.655 --> 00:11:14.755\nCell phones operate, sometimes,\nin the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n223\n00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:21.012\nBluetooth that we've talked about\noperates in the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n224\n00:11:21.012 --> 00:11:24.580\nSo you're gonna see heavily congested and\nyou could, because of that,\n\n225\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.870\nget lower performance, right?\n\n226\n00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:30.133\nBecause you have more tendency to\nget radio frequency interference.\n\n227\n00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:35.157\nSo that's one of the frequencies\nI want you to be aware of.\n\n228\n00:11:35.157 --> 00:11:39.854\nNow when we talk about channels, all\nright, well, again, we're not done with\n\n229\n00:11:39.854 --> 00:11:44.296\nchannels because we also have another\nspectrum, if you will, that we use.\n\n230\n00:11:44.296 --> 00:11:49.209\nAnd this has become more and more popular\nas we've gone through the different 802.11\n\n231\n00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.460\nwireless local area network standards.\n\n232\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.540\nWe're gonna talk about the WLAN\nstandards in another episode.\n\n233\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.080\nSo if that doesn't make sense,\ngo bump over and check that episode out.\n\n234\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.926\nAnd then you can come back here if you\nneed a little bit more clarification\n\n235\n00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:03.502\nfor that.\n\n236\n00:12:03.502 --> 00:12:08.207\nIn the earliest days, one of the very\nfirst standards that came out actually\n\n237\n00:12:08.207 --> 00:12:11.320\nwas implemented over\nthe 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n238\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.726\nNow the 5 gigahertz spectrum's a little\nbit different than 2.4 gigahertz, and\n\n239\n00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:18.344\nit's not just because\n[LAUGH] of the frequencies.\n\n240\n00:12:18.344 --> 00:12:24.224\nI mean, that would be kind of axiomatic\nthere, but this is more about, today it's\n\n241\n00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:30.030\nrelatively unused in comparison to\nthe long running 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n242\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.370\nSo it does have its benefits.\n\n243\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.570\nNow, I got a little example here.\n\n244\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.530\nThere's some other benefits\nto the 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n245\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:42.709\nDan, we said three of these\nnon-overlapping channels for 2.4.\n\n246\n00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:47.094\n5 gigahertz has 23\nnon-overlapping channels, 23.\n\n247\n00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:48.461\nSo you've got a lot more choices, right?\n\n248\n00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:51.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot less, what you call\nchannel congestion, I'm assuming.\n\n249\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, which equates to\na little bit better performance, right?\n\n250\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.761\nAnd the fact that it's not as widely\nused as 2.4 gigahertz just adds to that,\n\n251\n00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:00.022\nkinda compounds on it.\n\n252\n00:13:00.022 --> 00:13:01.706\nSo there's a plus to that.\n\n253\n00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:04.666\nNow, this isn't the ISM band.\n\n254\n00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:07.546\nThis is actually kind of\na heavily regulated band.\n\n255\n00:13:07.546 --> 00:13:11.048\nIt's actually called the Unlicensed\nNational Information Infrastructure.\n\n256\n00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:15.410\nI always remember it as UNI-II,\nright U-N-I- I-I.\n\n257\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.530\nNot really something that you have\nto understand on the exam, but\n\n258\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.324\nit is good information just for\nyour benefit regardless.\n\n259\n00:13:21.324 --> 00:13:24.324\nNow, just like 2.4 gigahertz,\n\n260\n00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:29.730\nthis is gonna have a benefit,\nand a drawback likewise, right?\n\n261\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.540\nAnd what is that?\n\n262\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.250\nWell, the benefit is the fact that\nyou get a lot better performance.\n\n263\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.010\nThe drawback is it's shorter distances,\nshorter ranges, right?\n\n264\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.680\nYou have to be closer to\nthe wireless access point to get\n\n265\n00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.840\nreally good strong signal.\n\n266\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.870\nNow as you'll learn, if you get\ninto wireless communications and\n\n267\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.790\nyou start supporting it, you'll see\nthat they also implement additional\n\n268\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.960\ntechnologies that are really\nbeneficial for 5 gigahertz as well.\n\n269\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.880\nThey've got antennas today,\nsmart antennas,\n\n270\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.270\nthat do really cool\nthings like beam forming.\n\n271\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.038\nAnd, yeah, that's kinda like\na sci-fi War of the Worlds.\n\n272\n00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:02.318\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're talking literally focusing in on\n\n273\n00:14:02.318 --> 00:14:06.750\nyour direction versus just increasing\nthe power to everybody within the network.\n\n274\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.020\nWe're talking literally channeling\ndown on a single device.\n\n275\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:17.808\nNow the other thing that's really good\nabout the 5 gigahertz spectrum there\n\n276\n00:14:17.808 --> 00:14:22.830\nis the fact that it also\nsupports something known as DFS.\n\n277\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.390\nAnd this is dynamic frequency selection.\n\n278\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.670\nAnd that's kind of really\ncool because we talked\n\n279\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.360\nabout the autoswitching\ninside of 2.4 gigahertz.\n\n280\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.790\nThis means that if it detects that\nyou're on a frequency that is actually\n\n281\n00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:43.368\ncongested in a way, it does give\nyou the ability to switch over.\n\n282\n00:14:43.368 --> 00:14:48.858\nAll right, now as a real small recap\nfrom our wireless 802.11 standards,\n\n283\n00:14:48.858 --> 00:14:53.556\nI want you to remember that\n802.11a operates in 5 gigahertz.\n\n284\n00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:58.002\nThe B, G, and N, well,\nB and G, if you will,\n\n285\n00:14:58.002 --> 00:15:03.400\nthey also operate in 2.4 gigahertz,\nboth of them.\n\n286\n00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.187\nAnd then the N standard, 802.11n,\nit is a dual band standard.\n\n287\n00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:11.098\nAnd the fact that it operates in\n2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz so\n\n288\n00:15:11.098 --> 00:15:14.664\nthat N devices could support\nall the earlier legacy devices,\n\n289\n00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:19.720\ncurrently what we have today, what's kind\nof really popular is the AC standard.\n\n290\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.816\nAnd the AC standard, you'll see a lot of\nthem implement the 2.4 gigahertz as dual\n\n291\n00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:27.710\nband, kind of like what N does with\nthe specification 5 gigahertz.\n\n292\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.740\nAnd you get a lot of better performance.\n\n293\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.610\nThe channels, if you will,\n\n294\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.610\ncan be aggregated together to make a\nlarger pipeline to send information over.\n\n295\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.370\nAll right, so Dan, that's a little bit\nabout the channels that we have but\n\n296\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.570\nthere are other technologies that\nwe kind of gotta talk about too,\n\n297\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.780\nand they mention things like port\nforwarding and port triggering.\n\n298\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.766\nAll right, and these are very,\nvery beneficial, all right?\n\n299\n00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:55.538\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind\nis that when communications come\n\n300\n00:15:55.538 --> 00:16:00.059\ninto your wireless device, or\neven your wired router, I mean,\n\n301\n00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.421\nboth wired and wireless do this.\n\n302\n00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:07.922\nWhen you have information coming across\nthe Internet going into your network,\n\n303\n00:16:07.922 --> 00:16:11.781\nYou might want a specific type\nof traffic to be basically\n\n304\n00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:16.730\ndirected to a single end point or\na single device within your networks.\n\n305\n00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.500\nSo, what port forwarding allows you to do\nis to say when that information comes in\n\n306\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.020\nInto your network,\nsend it to this computer.\n\n307\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.380\nLet me give you a couple of examples or\n\n308\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.600\nscenarios where that's\nvery beneficial; right?\n\n309\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.340\nIf you're a gamer, right?\n\n310\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.300\nThe gamers use this a lot, and\none of the great things about it is,\n\n311\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.050\nlet's say you have a game that you're\nplaying online, and you want to make sure\n\n312\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.500\nthat when that information comes in\nit goes directly to your gaming PC.\n\n313\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.110\nWell, that's where port\nforwarding comes in.\n\n314\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.180\nPort forwarding will tell the wireless\nrouter, access point, if you will, or\n\n315\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.046\neven the wired router that,\nagain, this is not a wireless,\n\n316\n00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:54.170\nwired standard, it tells the device okay,\nI see that gaming traffic.\n\n317\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.000\nSend it that direction.\n\n318\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.690\nAnother way we use this too, Dan,\nI don't know if you've ever done this.\n\n319\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.900\nMaybe connected from your work at one\nplace, the various places you've worked,\n\n320\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.011\nback to your computer at home\nover like an RDP connection or\n\n321\n00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:06.920\na remote desktop protocol connection.\n\n322\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.660\nWell, if I've got five Windows\ndevices within my network and\n\n323\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.090\nmy router, wireless or wired,\nsays, I see RDP traffic.\n\n324\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:16.770\nWe've got ten Windows devices here.\n\n325\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which one do you want, right?\n\n326\n00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:19.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so.\n\n327\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.980\nWhat port forwarding does is it says,\nokay send it to this device.\n\n328\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.620\nAnd yeah that's common to be\nable to connect from work\n\n329\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.010\nover the public network like the Internet\nback and to your internal network.\n\n330\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.720\nThe other thing I mentioned\nwas port triggering\n\n331\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.690\none of the things I want you to keep in\nmind is when it comes to port triggering,\n\n332\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.820\na little bit different here\nconcept is close to the same.\n\n333\n00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.670\nAnd when we say port triggering,\nwhat's the difference?\n\n334\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.120\nWell, port forwarding understand\nleaves that rule open all right?\n\n335\n00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.892\nI want you to think of it as punching\na hole in the side of the pool, all right?\n\n336\n00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:53.920\nAnd water can leak out, but\nyou're not fixing it, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.690\nI want you to think of port\ntriggering as the same thing,\n\n338\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.650\nonly you got the ability to put a plug,\nput a cork in the hole in the pool.\n\n339\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.790\nSo you're saying wait a second.\n\n340\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.440\nWhat the heck does that mean, all right?\n\n341\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.680\nWell, port triggering is a way to\ndo the same thing, port forwarding.\n\n342\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.570\nIt's when I see this traffic,\n\n343\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.890\nsend it to a certain destination\nwithin inside of my network.\n\n344\n00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.960\nBut after you're done, close it down.\n\n345\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.900\nI don't want that hole always\nopen allowing communications\n\n346\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.240\npermanently in my network.\n\n347\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.310\nSo port triggering is\ndynamic port forwarding.\n\n348\n00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.080\nIn the fact that it opens the port, sends\nthe information where it needs to go, and\n\n349\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.570\nthen it closes that port down.\n\n350\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.930\nAnd again, a great thing to have and\n\n351\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.580\nyou can set them up, there are rules\nyou can set up in order to do this.\n\n352\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.240\nAll right, so that's port forwarding.\n\n353\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.230\nNow, in another episode we talked\nabout what the DHCP protocol is?\n\n354\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.375\nAnd I know, it's kind of redundant here.\n\n355\n00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:45.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the dynamic host\n\n356\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.530\nconfiguration protocol?\n\n357\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.210\nRemember if you've got a lot of\nmobile devices in your SOHOs.\n\n358\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.740\nYou got a lot of laptops that\nare coming in and out of your network.\n\n359\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.460\nMaybe you don't want to statically assign,\n\n360\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.550\nmanually assign every IP address\nsubnet mask default gateway.\n\n361\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.190\nFor the TCPIP properties of every\nsingle device within your network.\n\n362\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.140\nIn fact, some people do.\n\n363\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.310\nI know I've got quite a few\nthat I do this myself.\n\n364\n00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.850\nAnd I believe you've got a media server.\n\n365\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.100\nDoes that have a static IP address?\n\n366\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.860\n&gt;&gt; It does not have a static IP address.\n\n367\n00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.552\n&gt;&gt; It does not, alright,\nhe's living on the wild side.\n\n368\n00:19:14.552 --> 00:19:15.386\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n369\n00:19:15.386 --> 00:19:16.106\n&gt;&gt; And some people do,\n\n370\n00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:20.036\nthey've got a specific device, that they\nalways wanna have the same IP address,\n\n371\n00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:23.156\nright?\nWell that would again get a little\n\n372\n00:19:23.156 --> 00:19:26.350\nbit complicated if you're doing that\nto every single device on your network.\n\n373\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.900\nAll right, so you have the ability to\ndynamically assign the IP address.\n\n374\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.230\nWhen the computer or the device connects\nto your network it calls out to\n\n375\n00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.430\nthe network, like we've talked about with\nDHCP and says hey, I need an IP address.\n\n376\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.350\nCan you give me one?\n\n377\n00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.820\nAnd your devices can provide\nthat configuration information.\n\n378\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.850\nDHCP can be turned on, can be turned off.\n\n379\n00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.920\nIt's really up to you.\n\n380\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.820\nJust remember that you have that ability,\nokay?\n\n381\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.400\nSometimes you have to\nactually turn it off.\n\n382\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.300\nSometimes your modems will do this for\nyou.\n\n383\n00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.370\nAnd understand that your modem is\nthe first connection from your cable\n\n384\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.620\ncompany into your network.\n\n385\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.920\nAnd then behind that a lot of\ntime sits your router, right?\n\n386\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.150\nYour wireless access point.\n\n387\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:08.940\nSo if the modem is doing DHCP,\nyou might turn it off on the access point.\n\n388\n00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.590\nVice versa, a lot of times you have\nthe ability to log into a modem.\n\n389\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.630\nTurn the DHCP off and say I want to do it\non the router because I wanna control it.\n\n390\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.460\nSo it's a level of control that you\ncan choose or not to choose to use.\n\n391\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what I typically do is,\nbecause I have cable, right?\n\n392\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:29.520\nSo my cable modem is doing DHCP, and I'm\ngetting an IP address from my ISP, right?\n\n393\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.400\nThey're giving me one of their own.\n\n394\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.830\nSo when I hook up my wireless router,\nit's giving it a DHCP address, right?\n\n395\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.200\nBut it also has DHCP installed.\n\n396\n00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.680\nNow, I can either try to get my\nDHCP server to work well with my\n\n397\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.110\ncable modem's DHCP server.\n\n398\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.990\nBut typically what I do is just make\nsure they are in different ranges, and\n\n399\n00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.300\nthen allow the two to talk together and\n\n400\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.160\nthen basically separating the networks\nusing my wireless access point.\n\n401\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.250\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good design,\nsaying hey we're gonna hand out\n\n402\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.595\nthis stack of cards or\nIP addresses to a certain many devices.\n\n403\n00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:02.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This stack of cards or\n\n404\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.750\nstack of IP addresses will be handed out.\n\n405\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.710\nIt's a really good configuration\nthat you've got there.\n\n406\n00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.120\nNow, some of the other things that we\nwanna talk about when we say SOHOs.\n\n407\n00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.270\nSOHO wireless or wired,\n\n408\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.035\nagain now understand some of the concepts\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n409\n00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:17.845\nThe channels are specific to wireless.\n\n410\n00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:21.705\nEverything else that we've talked\nabout could be wired or wireless.\n\n411\n00:21:21.705 --> 00:21:23.595\nSo, they talk about what's known as a DMZ.\n\n412\n00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:29.650\nThe level in which you can do this,\nis really contingent on how good,\n\n413\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.710\nthe wireless or wired router is.\n\n414\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.670\nSome basic home routers\nallow you to do this.\n\n415\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.410\nSometimes you do have to get\na higher-priced router just because it's\n\n416\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.410\nmore of a business class functionality.\n\n417\n00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.060\nAnd that's something known again\nas the demilitarized zone.\n\n418\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.780\nSo DMZ, what does that mean?\n\n419\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.330\nAll right,\nwell I got a little diagram here and\n\n420\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.880\na lot of times in the SOHO\nenvironments what happens is,\n\n421\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.880\nthat we do this a little bit different\nin the Enterprise Networks, for\n\n422\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.815\nthe reasons that we do this, but If you\nwill the concepts are still the same.\n\n423\n00:21:55.815 --> 00:22:00.925\nA DMZ what it does is it takes and\nit creates this logical, so in software,\n\n424\n00:22:00.925 --> 00:22:05.435\nthis logical perimeter\nnetwork if you will.\n\n425\n00:22:05.435 --> 00:22:08.222\nA network outside of your network.\n\n426\n00:22:08.222 --> 00:22:09.662\nWell why would you want to do that?\n\n427\n00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.392\nWell if I'm out there on the Internet,\nright?\n\n428\n00:22:11.392 --> 00:22:12.962\nIf this young lady is out\nthere on the Internet,\n\n429\n00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:17.072\nmaybe she's hosting a web\nserver in her internal network.\n\n430\n00:22:17.072 --> 00:22:20.542\nAnd she wants to gain public\naccess to that one device.\n\n431\n00:22:21.582 --> 00:22:23.902\nWell, in order to do that right?\n\n432\n00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:28.302\nPublic access she might have\nto do port forwarding, right?\n\n433\n00:22:28.302 --> 00:22:31.790\nBut what if she wants a few other\npeople to have access to it as well.\n\n434\n00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.340\nWell, you don't want people to have\naccess to your internal network.\n\n435\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.410\nSo what a DMZ does is it essentially\ncreates two firewalls, right?\n\n436\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.090\nA firewall is something that allows or\n\n437\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.350\ndenies traffic based on rules,\na security implementation.\n\n438\n00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.550\nWell this kind of logically\ncreates an external firewall and\n\n439\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.680\nan internal firewall.\n\n440\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.050\nThink of the two brick walls and then\nin the middle of that you put a single\n\n441\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.830\ncomputer that you want to expose\nthe access to the Internet, right?\n\n442\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.110\nWithout exposing the rest of your network,\nright?\n\n443\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.174\nI got to make sure that we say that.\n\n444\n00:23:00.174 --> 00:23:02.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there's no purpose in a DMZ.\n\n445\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.630\nThat's really a DMZ and like I said,\n\n446\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.140\nwe do this a little bit differently in\nenterprise networks because there's\n\n447\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.460\nusually multiple resources\nin enterprise network.\n\n448\n00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.260\nMight be an entire server farm that\nthey wanna give you access to but\n\n449\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.160\nthey certainly don't want to give\nyou access to the internal network.\n\n450\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.050\nAgain, the ability to do that is really\nbased on the quality of the device.\n\n451\n00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.720\nA lot of the home SOHO-based\ntype wireless routers and\n\n452\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.220\nwired routers at least will\nallow you to expose one device.\n\n453\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.000\nAnd that'll create the DMZ.\n\n454\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.700\nYour more enterprise\ndevices allow you to expose\n\n455\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.740\na lot of the different resources that\nyou have publicly to the Internet.\n\n456\n00:23:37.855 --> 00:23:42.810\nAlright, so next thing we ought to\ntalk about is, when we talk about\n\n457\n00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:47.540\nTCP IP characteristics, we've talked\nabout private and public IP addresses.\n\n458\n00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.968\nAnd in your internal local area networks,\nI want you to understand that,\n\n459\n00:23:50.968 --> 00:23:52.645\nwe use private IP addresses right?\n\n460\n00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:56.463\nAnd this is very convenient because\na public IP address has to be leased\n\n461\n00:23:56.463 --> 00:24:00.927\ntypically from an ISP, an internet service\nprovider, and even more so the ISP has\n\n462\n00:24:00.927 --> 00:24:05.068\nto lease that all the way up the hierarchy\nof the Internet back up to something\n\n463\n00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:10.021\nknown as the International Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, right?\n\n464\n00:24:10.021 --> 00:24:12.006\nIt's.\nIt's regulated.\n\n465\n00:24:12.006 --> 00:24:13.951\nHowever, that would be very expensive,\n\n466\n00:24:13.951 --> 00:24:16.350\nif we were to try to do that\ninside our home network.\n\n467\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:20.637\nSo what we use is a technology\ncalled Network Address Translation.\n\n468\n00:24:20.637 --> 00:24:23.220\nAnd network address\ntranslations is essentially,\n\n469\n00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.867\na way that we can take\nan internal private IP address.\n\n470\n00:24:25.867 --> 00:24:28.378\nAnd again, keep in mind that we do\nhave an episode on what public,\n\n471\n00:24:28.378 --> 00:24:29.620\nprivate IP addresses are here.\n\n472\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.410\nSo we're not really gonna\ntouch too much on those.\n\n473\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.130\nJust remember, private IP address can\nonly be used within your private network.\n\n474\n00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.900\nIt can't send information technically\nout across the internet, right?\n\n475\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.290\nNow, there is a technology called\nnetwork address translation,\n\n476\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.130\nthat allows us to take those\ninternal IP addresses, and\n\n477\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.880\nmap them in this case to a single\npublic IP address, right?\n\n478\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.815\nAnd what it does, in fact, let's go\nahead and I got a diagram here too.\n\n479\n00:24:57.815 --> 00:25:00.876\nAnd this is just, so you remember\nthe recap that we talked about in other\n\n480\n00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:03.135\nepisodes, what the private\nIP address ranges are.\n\n481\n00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:05.546\nSo when I'm sending information out,\nkeep in mind,\n\n482\n00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:07.647\nwhen we send information\nout to the Internet.\n\n483\n00:25:07.647 --> 00:25:10.661\nMy computer has got that\nproperty of it's network adapter,\n\n484\n00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:15.050\nit's got that internal private IP address,\nand it won't make it across the internet.\n\n485\n00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.834\nSo with your wireless router,\nyour wired router does,\n\n486\n00:25:17.834 --> 00:25:20.629\nit says, okay,\nI see this is a private IP address.\n\n487\n00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:23.395\nLet me go ahead and I'm gonna do\na little packet crafting here, right,\n\n488\n00:25:23.395 --> 00:25:24.050\nnot in a bad way.\n\n489\n00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.968\nAnd I'm gonna remove that IP address, and\n\n490\n00:25:25.968 --> 00:25:29.360\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nreplace it with my public IP address.\n\n491\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.190\nAnd now,\nI can send it out across the Internet, and\n\n492\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.570\nit's routable across the Internet.\n\n493\n00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:37.100\nIt can hop from network, to network,\nto network, and get to the destination.\n\n494\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.120\nSo again, a very, very nice technology.\n\n495\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.100\nNow what happens when\nthe information comes back in,\n\n496\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.290\nif we move this back up here, you'll see.\n\n497\n00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:51.023\nThat as the information comes back in,\nit's gonna look kinda like this, right.\n\n498\n00:25:51.023 --> 00:25:54.462\nIt's gonna have that public IP address\non it, that's the public IP address, so\n\n499\n00:25:54.462 --> 00:25:55.520\nyour access point.\n\n500\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.950\nJust kinda like Dan was saying, hey,\n\n501\n00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:01.830\nmy access point on the ISP side\nreceives an IP address, dynamically.\n\n502\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.721\nWell, that's coming from the ISP.\n\n503\n00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:09.780\nSo that IP address will be removed, and\nthe private IP address will be replaced.\n\n504\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.131\nAnd then it will be delivered to the\ndevice that's sending the information out.\n\n505\n00:26:14.131 --> 00:26:17.530\nAll right, so that's a little bit\nabout network address translation.\n\n506\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:22.506\nNow, when you have a single public IP\naddress, and your mapping multiple\n\n507\n00:26:22.506 --> 00:26:26.358\ninternal IP addresses to that\nsingle public IP address,\n\n508\n00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:28.377\nthat's called Dynamic NAT.\n\n509\n00:26:28.377 --> 00:26:31.190\nAll right,\nDynamic Network Address Translation.\n\n510\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.340\nSo when you go on to network [INAUDIBLE]\nand beyond, you go into Cisco,\n\n511\n00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.750\nyou'll learn about things like static\nnetwork address translation, likewise.\n\n512\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.532\nAll right, so that is our NAT and DNET.\n\n513\n00:26:42.532 --> 00:26:44.997\nWe've got a couple more things there,\nDan, I know we're getting close on time.\n\n514\n00:26:44.997 --> 00:26:47.810\nHere, we've got what is known\nas Basic QoS, all right.\n\n515\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.110\nSo, basically, what is QoS, right?\n\n516\n00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.790\n&gt;&gt; QoS.\n\n517\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n518\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.820\n&gt;&gt; They forgot the u, cuz in the English\nlanguage, it's always Quo, right?\n\n519\n00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n520\n00:26:55.345 --> 00:26:56.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what I was thinking?\n\n521\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.287\nIt's probably a Star Trek character,\nright?\n\n522\n00:26:57.287 --> 00:26:58.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah say, QoS?\n\n523\n00:26:58.585 --> 00:26:59.724\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; QoS [LAUGH].\n\n524\n00:26:59.724 --> 00:27:01.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what is QoS?\n\n525\n00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.852\nQ-O-S is something known as\nquality of service, all right.\n\n526\n00:27:04.852 --> 00:27:07.740\nAnd let's take it back to where we\nwere doing port forwarding, right?\n\n527\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.590\nAnd, if we talk about port forwarding,\nand you're in a gaming situation,\n\n528\n00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.030\nand you wanna send that\ninformation to a gaming PC.\n\n529\n00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.059\nHow about the ability to say that it\ntakes precedence over HTTP traffic,\n\n530\n00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:23.779\nfile transfer protocol traffic,\nNetflix traffic.\n\n531\n00:27:23.779 --> 00:27:27.317\nAnd we wanna say, you know what, I wanna\ntake the majority of the pipeline and\n\n532\n00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:28.630\nthe amount of data, right.\n\n533\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:33.655\nThat I can send over this connection,\nand I wanna make sure everything that\n\n534\n00:27:33.655 --> 00:27:38.541\ngoes to that PC gaming machine,\nis the highest priority on the network.\n\n535\n00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:41.722\nSlow everything else down,\nyou just slow things down and\n\n536\n00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:44.579\ngive me all the amount of\nspeed that I need, right?\n\n537\n00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:46.285\nAnd essentially that's basic QoS,\n\n538\n00:27:46.285 --> 00:27:49.480\nit's a way to prioritize\ndifferent types of traffic, right?\n\n539\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.620\nSo maybe, you have in your house,\nwhere maybe you're not a gamer, right?\n\n540\n00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.460\nMaybe you're like one of the other host,\nreally,\n\n541\n00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.480\nreally loves streaming\nmedia in media center.\n\n542\n00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.200\nIn fact, Dan I know.\n\n543\n00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.630\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; You do too, right?\n\n544\n00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.342\nHow about this?\n\n545\n00:27:59.342 --> 00:28:03.440\nI wanna make sure or try to make sure that\nI don't have any hiccups to the video when\n\n546\n00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.580\nI'm streaming media.\n\n547\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:10.923\nWhat we take the majority of the amount\nof traffic, the pipeline, if you will.\n\n548\n00:28:10.923 --> 00:28:15.834\nAnd we say the most, all this traffic,\nI wanna make sure that that streaming\n\n549\n00:28:15.834 --> 00:28:19.920\nmedia gets the highest priority\nwithin the list, right.\n\n550\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.921\nIt's me, all right, send it first,\nslow everything else down, all right.\n\n551\n00:28:24.921 --> 00:28:28.600\nLast couple of things here that\nwe wanna just kind of mention,\n\n552\n00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.880\nis something known as firmware.\n\n553\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.710\nFirmware is no different than what\nwe've talked about in our BiOS section.\n\n554\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.140\nKeep in mind, firmware, BiOS,\nUEFI, and PCs, if you will.\n\n555\n00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.239\nThis is essentially a way to bring\nthe hardware online, stabilize it, and\n\n556\n00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:43.158\nget it running.\n\n557\n00:28:43.158 --> 00:28:44.341\nYou have a very small,\n\n558\n00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:49.092\noptimized streamline Operating System that\nare on these network connectivity devices.\n\n559\n00:28:49.092 --> 00:28:52.320\nAnd, they still need the hardware,\nwhen you turn it on,\n\n560\n00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.095\nthey still need the hardware\nto be initialized.\n\n561\n00:28:55.095 --> 00:28:57.018\nAnd that's essentially,\nwhat firmware is doing, right?\n\n562\n00:28:57.018 --> 00:28:59.709\nIt starts your hardware,\nand get's it running.\n\n563\n00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:02.882\nBe very careful with firmware,\nbecause it does sit in ROM chips,\n\n564\n00:29:02.882 --> 00:29:07.455\ntypically EEPROM chips today, electrically\nerasable, programmable, read only memory.\n\n565\n00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:10.293\nAnd, when you're sending an electrical\ncurrent over that board,\n\n566\n00:29:10.293 --> 00:29:11.404\ninto that firmware chip.\n\n567\n00:29:11.404 --> 00:29:14.540\nYou're essentially writing\nthe instructions that are in it.\n\n568\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.250\nAnd if that process gets interrupted,\nyou could permanently,\n\n569\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.322\nwe call it breaking a device.\n\n570\n00:29:18.322 --> 00:29:19.396\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I've done this once or twice,\n\n571\n00:29:19.396 --> 00:29:22.120\nI don't know if you've done it-\n&gt;&gt; Turn a computer into a nice\n\n572\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.660\nstore stop [LAUGH].\n\n573\n00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.175\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nexpensive paper way, right?\n\n574\n00:29:25.175 --> 00:29:26.371\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n575\n00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:28.800\n&gt;&gt; So and it's no joke,\nthat's why they call it a break right.\n\n576\n00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.370\nCuz now it can hold paper on your desk,\nbut\n\n577\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.300\nit can't move your traffic from\nyour computer to the Internet.\n\n578\n00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.594\n&gt;&gt; It can't do anything [LAUGH].\n\n579\n00:29:34.594 --> 00:29:36.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nit can't do anything.\n\n580\n00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.570\nSo just make sure that you\ndon't interrupt that process.\n\n581\n00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:45.041\nOne other thing here that we kinda\nwanna talk about is Universal Plug and\n\n582\n00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:47.238\nPlay, you might hear UPnP.\n\n583\n00:29:47.238 --> 00:29:50.240\nPlug and Play technologies we've\ntalked about before, right?\n\n584\n00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.900\nThe ability to plug a device into a PC.\n\n585\n00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:58.690\nThe BiOS or the firmware talks to the\nhardware, talks to the Operating System,\n\n586\n00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.910\nand configures everything, and\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n587\n00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.214\nWell, universal plug and play is the same\nconcept, but it's a networking protocol.\n\n588\n00:30:05.214 --> 00:30:07.432\nRight now,\nwe're doing this over the network,\n\n589\n00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:09.335\nit's not just a local plug into a device.\n\n590\n00:30:09.335 --> 00:30:13.601\nIt's the fact that when you plug a device\ninto your network through another\n\n591\n00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:15.100\ncomputer, or whatever.\n\n592\n00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.758\nThat it can call out, if you will,\nand advertise to each other, hey,\n\n593\n00:30:18.758 --> 00:30:20.000\nthis is what I'm here.\n\n594\n00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.130\nThese are the services that I have,\nlike file sharing, if you will, and\n\n595\n00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.760\nit's one of these\nzero-configure technologies.\n\n596\n00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.581\nNow Dan, I'm gonna run just\na little bit longer on this one,\n\n597\n00:30:28.581 --> 00:30:29.651\ncuz I did wanna show just a little bit.\n\n598\n00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:30.151\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We've talked a lot about this here, so\n\n599\n00:30:30.151 --> 00:30:34.814\nlet's go ahead and dive in.\nI actually have a wireless access\n\n600\n00:30:34.814 --> 00:30:39.922\npoint interface right there.\nSo let's just kind of real\n\n601\n00:30:39.922 --> 00:30:42.668\nquick look at some of the configurations.\nLike Dan mentioned\n\n602\n00:30:42.668 --> 00:30:45.612\nearlier, talking about your\nIP address coming from your\n\n603\n00:30:45.612 --> 00:30:47.401\nInternet Service Provider.\nWell,\n\n604\n00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:50.965\nthat's what you would see right here.\nIf I get my IP address,\n\n605\n00:30:50.965 --> 00:30:52.455\nI'm gonna find it somewhere in here.\n\n606\n00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:54.865\nAnd a lot of times,\nyou'll see that it's auto configuration.\n\n607\n00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:58.025\nYou might have some kind of\ncompany that is gonna say hey,\n\n608\n00:30:58.025 --> 00:31:00.575\nthis is the manual configurations and\nstuff that we need.\n\n609\n00:31:00.575 --> 00:31:05.475\nIt's always based on whatever\nthe Internet connection type is.\n\n610\n00:31:05.475 --> 00:31:10.952\nNotice that we could set what\nthe internal DHCP is gonna be handed out.\n\n611\n00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.784\nWe can also set things like static,\nwe can say, okay, no,\n\n612\n00:31:13.784 --> 00:31:16.464\nI want that media server always\nto have this IP address.\n\n613\n00:31:16.464 --> 00:31:19.798\nSo when another computer connects,\ndon't give it that IP address,\n\n614\n00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:20.950\nI want it to be this one.\n\n615\n00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:25.244\nSo, there's as you can\nsee some of your DHCP.\n\n616\n00:31:25.244 --> 00:31:27.968\nAdvanced routing, if I go over\nto the Advanced Routing tab, and\n\n617\n00:31:27.968 --> 00:31:29.235\nthese are really different.\n\n618\n00:31:29.235 --> 00:31:30.878\nThis is a Linksys based device, right?\n\n619\n00:31:30.878 --> 00:31:32.910\nSo owned by Belkin now,\nused to be owned by Cisco.\n\n620\n00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.860\nKeep in mind, they're gonna be\na little bit different, but\n\n621\n00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.730\nwe at least want to give you some hands on\nhere, and kind of see what you would do.\n\n622\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.973\nIf you were to get to these\ninterfaces on your access points,\n\n623\n00:31:42.973 --> 00:31:47.819\ntypically, what you'll do is you'll\nlog in to like a 192.168.1.1 address.\n\n624\n00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:49.430\nAnd it brings up the interface,\n\n625\n00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.620\ncould be a 192.168.0.1 address,\nthose are typically the defaults.\n\n626\n00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.860\n&gt;&gt; Should be in your devices\ndocumentation [LAUGH].\n\n627\n00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.721\n&gt;&gt; Even better.\n\n628\n00:31:56.721 --> 00:31:57.961\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nmaybe I should tell you guys that.\n\n629\n00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:59.918\nCheck the manufacturer [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n630\n00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.560\n&gt;&gt; That'll tell you a lot.\n\n631\n00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.585\nIf you look in here,\nyou can see NAT's enabled, right.\n\n632\n00:32:04.585 --> 00:32:07.949\nThere are, this one's a little more\nadvanced Cuz it can do some basic routing\n\n633\n00:32:07.949 --> 00:32:11.130\nprotocols and stuff, but that's well\nbeyond the scope of the A+ exam.\n\n634\n00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.448\nBut just notice that I can turn NAT on and\noff here.\n\n635\n00:32:14.448 --> 00:32:17.660\nWe also talked about DMZ's and\nport forwarding and port triggering.\n\n636\n00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.250\nIf I go to in this case this is\nkinda common to the WRT Software\n\n637\n00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.130\nthat Linksys runs.\n\n638\n00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.510\nYou go to application and gaming, right?\n\n639\n00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.210\nWe can see single port forwarding,\nthat's a single rule, right?\n\n640\n00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.750\nYou can see a port range because sometimes\nyour gaming applications will use, say,\n\n641\n00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:37.325\nport 10,000 to send Port 10020, so\nyou have to have that whole range,\n\n642\n00:32:37.325 --> 00:32:41.175\nit just says anything within that range\nis gonna go to this specific device.\n\n643\n00:32:41.175 --> 00:32:43.885\nThe other thing we have here is\nport triggering, and you can see\n\n644\n00:32:43.885 --> 00:32:47.565\nthe interfaces are almost identical,\njust, it's dynamic port forwarding.\n\n645\n00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:50.945\nAnd then notice the last couple\nof things that we have here, Dan,\n\n646\n00:32:50.945 --> 00:32:54.655\nwe've got the DMZ, so\nI can set up a DMZ if I want it,\n\n647\n00:32:54.655 --> 00:32:59.360\nI can say this IP address, it come from\nany IP address, what's the destination.\n\n648\n00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.310\nAnd that essentially exposes that\none device, that web server and\n\n649\n00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.940\nessentially puts it in\nbetween to logical firewalls.\n\n650\n00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.230\nSo that they can't get to\nyour internal network, but\n\n651\n00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.300\nthey can get to the IP of this device.\n\n652\n00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.380\nLast but not least we set basic QoS.\n\n653\n00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.230\nBasic QoS right here,\nnotice that I can, if I enable it,\n\n654\n00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.430\nI can say okay what kind of\nI'm online gaming, right?\n\n655\n00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.910\nIn this case, MAC Address, I can say, hey,\nthat device it's gonna get the priority.\n\n656\n00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.732\nMaybe I have a gaming server on my network\nand I'm doing a LAN party and I want that\n\n657\n00:33:27.732 --> 00:33:31.750\ngame server to be able to really send some\ninformation out to my, multiple people.\n\n658\n00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.428\nYou could do that, right?\n\n659\n00:33:32.428 --> 00:33:34.570\nOr a voice over IP device.\n\n660\n00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.560\nAnd you could set the priority here,\nyou could see priority in the background.\n\n661\n00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.480\nI could say, hey,\nthis is gonna be high priority.\n\n662\n00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.710\nThat's that game, and\nI don't wanna miss any frames per second.\n\n663\n00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.220\nI wanna make sure I get that head shot,\nright?\n\n664\n00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.400\nI don't wanna find my stuff\nlaying on the ground and\n\n665\n00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.820\nI'm reset back to the lobby right?\n\n666\n00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.770\nBefore anybody,\nbefore I'm even, realize it.\n\n667\n00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.818\nDon't worry about any of these settings,\nyou wanna know acknowledgement there,\n\n668\n00:33:53.818 --> 00:33:56.220\nthat just means,\ndid you receive the information?\n\n669\n00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.970\nNo, I didn't receive the information but\n\n670\n00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.720\nthose are essentially some of the things\nyou can see inside your wireless routers.\n\n671\n00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.921\nAnd keep in mind that, your wired routers,\n\n672\n00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:06.670\na lot of times have these\nsame types of interfaces.\n\n673\n00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.168\nYou know what, let me do one more thing,\nspeaking of wireless,\n\n674\n00:34:09.168 --> 00:34:10.850\nI didn't even show you guys the wireless.\n\n675\n00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.940\nSo let me just show you this real quick,\nhere's the wireless section and\n\n676\n00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.419\nif I change it to manual\nnotice that we have,\n\n677\n00:34:17.419 --> 00:34:20.430\nyou can see the five\ngigahertz spectrum here.\n\n678\n00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:25.700\nAnd I told you Auto (DFS), that's dynamic\nfrequency selection, and channel-width.\n\n679\n00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.360\nYou can do and yeah,\nlet's change this to Auto, here we go.\n\n680\n00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.530\nNow you can see some of the channels\nthat are available here\n\n681\n00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.750\ninside of the access point.\n\n682\n00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.810\nSame thing with the 2.4\nGHz wireless settings.\n\n683\n00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.450\nNotice that I can also do Auto here,\nand if I scroll down,\n\n684\n00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.140\nthere are those 11\ndifferent channels there.\n\n685\n00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.425\nDan that we were talking about remember\nif you do this manually 1, 6, 11.\n\n686\n00:34:48.425 --> 00:34:51.626\nAnd a lot of times what we do\nis we just leave it to auto.\n\n687\n00:34:51.626 --> 00:34:55.410\nThe device is smart enough to know hey,\nI'm a little bogged down here.\n\n688\n00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:56.694\nChances are I'm gonna have to flip over.\n\n689\n00:34:56.694 --> 00:35:00.914\nSo all great stuff to have guys if\nyou have wireless access point.\n\n690\n00:35:00.914 --> 00:35:04.460\nDon't hesitate to jump in there and\nkinda look at the settings.\n\n691\n00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.169\nCheck your manufacturers.\n\n692\n00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.644\nDan that was a great piece of advice,\n\n693\n00:35:06.644 --> 00:35:10.080\ncheck your manufacturer's defined settings\nas well as what the recommendation is.\n\n694\n00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.130\nA lot of the manufacturers will give\nyou some good advice on how to peak and\n\n695\n00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.830\ntweak that Soho router so\nyou get the best experience possible.\n\n696\n00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.173\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that wraps\nup working with a Soho type\n\n697\n00:35:19.173 --> 00:35:22.232\nwireless router device very,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n698\n00:35:22.232 --> 00:35:25.458\nAnd the good news is it's probably not\nsomething that's Super unfamiliar to\n\n699\n00:35:25.458 --> 00:35:26.060\nyou, right?\n\n700\n00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.200\nWireless is very ubiquitous today, so\n\n701\n00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.170\nyou've probably had at\nleast some experience.\n\n702\n00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.980\nIf you haven't, do what Wes said.\n\n703\n00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.600\nGo grab you one.\n\n704\n00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.460\nThey're relatively cheap.\n\n705\n00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.270\nBuy one on Ebay or Craigslist or something\nthat you can destroy and play with and\n\n706\n00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.910\ndo whatever you want.\n\n707\n00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.410\nAnd start learning the technology\nwith some of that hands on.\n\n708\n00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.780\nThat's what's really gonna\nbenefit you in the long run.\n\n709\n00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.311\nAll right Wes thanks for joining us today\nand we do thank our audience for watching.\n\n710\n00:35:45.311 --> 00:35:49.460\nBut it is that time for us to sign off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n711\n00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.443\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n712\n00:35:50.443 --> 00:35:51.619\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n713\n00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:58.987\n[MUSIC]\n\n714\n00:35:58.987 -->

Coming to you live from [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.911\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.543\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n7\n00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:15.900\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.730\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n9\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.400\nin today's episode it's more in our\nA+ Series of thread to get old.\n\n10\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.220\n22901 for those of you keeping score.\n\n11\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.470\nAnd joining us in the studio, yet again\ntoday our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.400\nWes, glad to have you again,\nman how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nfeeling good here glad to be here and\n\n14\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.240\nwe are moving along.\n\n15\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.000\nIn fact we're, I would say if I'm keeping\nscore you guys are keeping track out here.\n\n16\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.518\nI think we're in, just about one of\nthe last networking episodes that we gotta\n\n17\n00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:42.760\ncover for the 901 exam.\n\n18\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.896\nAnd well,\nwhat are we gonna be talking about today?\n\n19\n00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:47.126\nBut we're gonna be taking\nabout some of the connections.\n\n20\n00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:50.935\nAnd the connections I mean are the\nservices that are provided out there along\n\n21\n00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:51.980\nthe Internet.\n\n22\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.922\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about\nthe different types of connections\n\n23\n00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:55.467\nyou can see.\n\n24\n00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.591\nAnd we're also gonna\ntalk about network types.\n\n25\n00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:01.071\nDan and I we've mentioned some acronyms,\nboy have we mentioned some acronyms,\n\n26\n00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:02.823\nas you guys and gals out there have seen.\n\n27\n00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:05.817\nAnd there are some geographical\nlocations if you will,\n\n28\n00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.309\nthat really define\ndifferent network types.\n\n29\n00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:12.095\nAnd that'd be one of the things that will\nbe looking at right towards the end of\n\n30\n00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:12.860\nthis episode.\n\n31\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.496\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right in.\n\n32\n00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:17.955\nAnd when we talk about internet\nconnection types well,\n\n33\n00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:20.430\nwhere are our Internet\nconnections coming from?\n\n34\n00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.070\nWell they're coming from\na service provider.\n\n35\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.050\nMaybe you've heard the term ISP.\n\n36\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.440\nIf you haven't heard of the term ISP,\nwell maybe you're not paying the bill.\n\n37\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.310\n[LAUGH] ISP is\nthe Internet Service Provider and\n\n38\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.630\nthey are the ones, they\nare the companies out there if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.510\nthat really give you\nthe connection to the Internet.\n\n40\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.400\nNow I want you to know that the Internet\nreally is a hierarchical design\n\n41\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200\nwhen we talk about Internet\nservice providers.\n\n42\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.147\nIn fact, you go all the way to\nthe top part of the hierarchy.\n\n43\n00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:47.328\nAnd you have a lot of standards bodies,\n\n44\n00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:50.810\nregulatory bodies if\nyou will that oversee.\n\n45\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.200\nAnd design specifications for\nwhat we know as the Internet today.\n\n46\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.310\nThe Internet, if you will,\n\n47\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.870\nactually started out as\na military/educational type network.\n\n48\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.050\nAnd when I say educational type network,\nwe're not talking about PBS or\n\n49\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.750\nSesame Street here.\n\n50\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.510\nBut what we're talking about is was\nreally just about the military's use of\n\n51\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.440\nnetwork communications as well\nas different universities.\n\n52\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.990\nAnd that's really all that was\nconnected to in those days.\n\n53\n00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.812\nIn fact, in the early days,\nit was called ARPANET.\n\n54\n00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:24.275\nAnd ARPANET was the Advanced\nResearch Project Agency's Network.\n\n55\n00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.353\nAnd they got into, I guess you'd say,\na coalition if you will,\n\n56\n00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:31.001\nwith a lot of the brilliant minds in\ndifferent universities like Stanford,\n\n57\n00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.150\nBerkley, if you will.\n\n58\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.640\nAnd essentially, formed and developed\nwhat would later be called the Internet.\n\n59\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.770\nSo what happened?\n\n60\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.140\nWhy this transformation for\nARPANET to the Internet?\n\n61\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.130\nWell, at a certain time, the ARPANET\nbecame yesterdays technology, and\n\n62\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.450\nthe military said, okay,\nhey as things have advanced.\n\n63\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.960\nWe need a little bit more\nprotection within our networks.\n\n64\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.680\nAnd the ARPANET really\nisn't giving us that,\n\n65\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.130\nbecause we just started having more and\nmore people connecting to it.\n\n66\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.730\nSo eventually what would\nhappen is the government,\n\n67\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.570\nour Department of Defense\nhere in the United States,\n\n68\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.970\nwould basically allocate what would\nbecome the Internet, the ARPANET.\n\n69\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.910\nOver to the public domain and\nthen it would be from there on out,\n\n70\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.850\nit would be overseen by bodies that pretty\nmuch were overseeing it to begin with.\n\n71\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.600\nIANA, if you will.\n\n72\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.250\nWe've kind of talked about them throughout\nthe series when we talked about\n\n73\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.760\nnetworking.\n\n74\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.060\nThe Internet Assign Numbers Authority and\nthen in 2003 formally,\n\n75\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.260\ntheir defense contracts expired and\nanother company,\n\n76\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.800\na corporation if you will, took over\nwhat we see today, and that's ICANN.\n\n77\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.140\nThat s the Internet Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers.\n\n78\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.090\nAnd military essentially did a split,\nright?\n\n79\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.560\nThey have the MILNET today and\n\n80\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.320\nthat's highly locked down,\nthat's the private military network.\n\n81\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.930\nAnd then we have the public Internet.\n\n82\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.410\nSo that's a little bit about the history\nbehind the Internet, if you will.\n\n83\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.566\nI also wanna talk about a couple of\ndifferent types of connections you can see\n\n84\n00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:51.104\nout there as well, very basically.\n\n85\n00:03:51.104 --> 00:03:55.490\nYou have two different types\nof means of communication.\n\n86\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.400\nActually, three different types really.\n\n87\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.490\nOne of the most prevalent types is what's\nknown as a packet switching network.\n\n88\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.040\nAnd when we talk about a packet switching\nnetwork, we're talking about packets,\n\n89\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.630\nif you will.\n\n90\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.791\nYour data can be broken down into\nthese data units called packets.\n\n91\n00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:11.061\nAnd they can route their\nway across the Internet.\n\n92\n00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:15.392\nAnd essentially, can be rebuilt and\nfind their way to the destination, and\n\n93\n00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:18.650\nnot necessarily does every\npacket follow the same path.\n\n94\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.250\nIn fact, a lot of times,\nrarely do they ever.\n\n95\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.160\nAnd the thought process was, and\n\n96\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.320\nI know there's a little conjecture\non the history behind this.\n\n97\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.690\nBut the thought process was,\nis back in the days when the military,\n\n98\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.900\nthe Department of Defense, had it.\n\n99\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.170\nWhat would happen during war times,\nif a large portion of the network\n\n100\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.515\nwas eradicated or\njust completely annihilated in war, right?\n\n101\n00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:40.360\nIt's the fact that the not so much self\nhealing, but that the data would have to\n\n102\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.390\nfind it's way around those broken portions\nof network and still get to the end point.\n\n103\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.940\nSo it's a very common technology.\n\n104\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.632\nIn fact, Ethernet,\nthat we have in our local area networks,\n\n105\n00:04:49.632 --> 00:04:52.829\nis the dominant local area\nnetwork communications.\n\n106\n00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.650\nThat's the network types that\nwe'll talk about coming up.\n\n107\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.230\nNow you also have other types\nof communications as well,\n\n108\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.060\nwe have two other ones.\n\n109\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.140\nThe other one is called\nCircuit Switching Network.\n\n110\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.310\nAnd these are going to be some of the\nfirst type of connections we talk about.\n\n111\n00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.250\nCircuit Switching is,\nthink about your telephones.\n\n112\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.751\nYour telephone communication\nis a circuit switch network.\n\n113\n00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:13.913\nAnd that's because you have some kind of\neither physical dedicated connection.\n\n114\n00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:17.626\nThat is established, maintained for\nthe duration of the communication.\n\n115\n00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:21.670\nAnd that communication goes\nacross that dedicated connection.\n\n116\n00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.049\nAnd then once you no longer need\nthat connection, what happens is,\n\n117\n00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:26.249\nthe circuit is broken.\n\n118\n00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.260\nAnd those resources go back over in to\nthe pool of resources that additional\n\n119\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.670\ncommunications can use.\n\n120\n00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.911\nNow, I say physical connections,\nkeep in mind, today,\n\n121\n00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:36.399\nthere's also logical connections\nthat do circuit switching.\n\n122\n00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:39.164\nAnd that's where you have\nsome kind of logical path,\n\n123\n00:05:39.164 --> 00:05:41.570\nsort of virtual circuit\nthat is established.\n\n124\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.080\nAnd it appears to us, if you will, in\nsoftware's being a dedicated connection.\n\n125\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.090\nAnd again, if you will, once that\ncommunication is no longer needed.\n\n126\n00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.496\nThen what happens is that pool,\nif you will, of resources, goes back into,\n\n127\n00:05:55.496 --> 00:06:00.145\ncollectively, the network for\nadditional connections, communications.\n\n128\n00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:05.665\nNow, so the last one here, you'll learn\nmore about Network Plus, I just want\n\n129\n00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.385\nto brief mention on this one and that's\nalso called a Cell Switching Network.\n\n130\n00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:12.080\nDon't think cellular communications,\nbut we talk about a cellular network.\n\n131\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.740\nWe talk about a fixed length data\nsize versus a packet switching,\n\n132\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.490\nwhich every individual data unit called\na packet can actually be varying sizes.\n\n133\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.770\nUnlike a cell switching network,\nin a cell switching network if you will,\n\n134\n00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.680\nevery single data unit is going\nto be the same, the same size.\n\n135\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.350\nAnd if it isn't the same size, then we put\na little padding or filler data in there.\n\n136\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.786\nAll right, so just kinda getting that\nout of the way before we dive into our\n\n137\n00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:38.585\nInternet connection.\n\n138\n00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:42.586\nJust some of the different kinda\ntechnologies that you might hear,\n\n139\n00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:44.359\ncould hear, on the A+ exam.\n\n140\n00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:47.200\nAnd again,\nreally brief they might mention that.\n\n141\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.920\nBut you'll definitely hear\nabout it in the NETPLUS.\n\n142\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.550\nSo, that form in the basis for\nthe Internet connections.\n\n143\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.150\nWhen we talk about Internet connections,\nkeep in mind that essentially,\n\n144\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.380\nthe Internet is nothing but a bunch of\nsmall networks that are inter-networked\n\n145\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.720\ntogether and controlled by these\nInternet service providers.\n\n146\n00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.170\nAs we come down the hierarchy,\n\n147\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.200\nI want you to understand that we have what\nare known as Internet backbone providers.\n\n148\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.460\nInternet backbone providers, these are the\ncompanies that lay the cables that form\n\n149\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.670\nthe Internet as we know it today.\n\n150\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.780\nThey're called the IVP.\n\n151\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.970\nThere's a,\nthink like nine of them world wide,\n\n152\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.598\nyou don't have to know this but\npeople like Verizon, AT&amp;T,\n\n153\n00:07:22.598 --> 00:07:26.560\nwell course AT&amp;T's been in communication\nsince communication started, right?\n\n154\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Definitely one of\nthe major players in this\n\n155\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.820\ntelecom world of which we're diving into.\n\n156\n00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n157\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.371\nAnd then as you go down,\nyou have things like regional ISPs.\n\n158\n00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:39.410\nAnd they literally, like it says,\nthey control major regions.\n\n159\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.660\nAnd then you have your local ISPs.\n\n160\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.800\nWe'll give you an example here Dan and\nI Live in the Gainesville area,\n\n161\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.230\nwe have GRUCom, which is G-R-U,\nGainesville Regional Units.\n\n162\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.832\nAnd then, maybe you guys have heard\nof them out there, Cox Communication.\n\n163\n00:07:51.832 --> 00:07:57.154\nSome of you might come from where maybe\nyou have, Brighthouse is one of them.\n\n164\n00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:59.044\nSome of them kind of crossed the line and\n\n165\n00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:01.290\nthere just dominate all\nover the place AT&amp;T.\n\n166\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.712\n&gt;&gt; AT&amp;T [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like Dan here has mentioned [LAUGH],\n\n167\n00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:04.870\nits been around for along time.\n\n168\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.034\nThey're an Internet Service Provider or\nbackbone provider, they're a regional\n\n169\n00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:12.550\nprovider and they're a local provider,\nVerizon being the same way.\n\n170\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.590\nSo keep in mind, when you get\na service from the Internet, right?\n\n171\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.370\nThe Internet Service Provider, I don't\ncare who it is if its local if you will,\n\n172\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.010\nunderstand that your local\nservice provider doesn't give you\n\n173\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.560\naccess to the backbone of the Internet,\nright, cuz they don't own it.\n\n174\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.680\nThose are the IBPs.\n\n175\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.421\nThey're the ones that have\naccess to these large,\n\n176\n00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:34.788\nmassive communication channels, right?\n\n177\n00:08:34.788 --> 00:08:37.486\nAnd essentially what they do\nis they lease a connection to\n\n178\n00:08:37.486 --> 00:08:40.020\nan Internet Service Provider\nthat's local to you.\n\n179\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.540\nSo you're getting access to their network,\nall right.\n\n180\n00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.737\nA little bit more I want you to understand\nis that really when it comes down to it,\n\n181\n00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:47.502\nyou're paying for\n\n182\n00:08:47.502 --> 00:08:50.732\na couple of things when you look at\nan Internet service connection, all right.\n\n183\n00:08:50.732 --> 00:08:54.569\nAnd it can differ greatly when you talk\nabout home, residential versus business.\n\n184\n00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:56.265\nBut let's talk about it very basically,\n\n185\n00:08:56.265 --> 00:09:00.320\ndoesn't matter which residential versus\nbusiness, you're paying for two things.\n\n186\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.360\nYou're paying for public IP address\nthat like we talked about in our IP\n\n187\n00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.130\naddressing schemes, allows you to\ncommunicate across the Internet,\n\n188\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.020\nthat's one of the big things, all right.\n\n189\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.020\nIn that hierarchical design,\nall the way from the IBPs to\n\n190\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.600\nthe local Internet Service Providers,\nthey are allocated up the chain, right?\n\n191\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.045\nWe have ICAN says okay Verizon,\nyou have this pool of IP addresses,\n\n192\n00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:25.010\nAT&amp;T you have this pool of IP addresses,\nand then regionals go to those guys,\n\n193\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.190\nand then your local, within your cities,\nthey go to the regionals.\n\n194\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.910\nAnd they get a pool of IP addresses.\n\n195\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.871\nSo that's one of the very first\nthings you have to understand.\n\n196\n00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.760\nThat when you get\na service provided to you,\n\n197\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.917\nthey're gonna allocate\nyou a public IP address.\n\n198\n00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:40.130\nAnd that public IP address allows to you\ncommunicate across the public network.\n\n199\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.390\nNow here's where the other thing comes\nin about the Internet connections.\n\n200\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.960\nIn fact, Dan and I were kind of joking\nabout this before we even started\n\n201\n00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.290\nthe episode is that its bandwidth, right?\n\n202\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.640\nHow much connection speed do you need,\nall right?\n\n203\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.520\nAnd there's other bells and\n\n204\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.830\nwhistles that go along with\nevery plan that you might have.\n\n205\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.460\nBut really, that's what it boils down to.\n\n206\n00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.080\nWell how much speed do you need, right?\n\n207\n00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.158\nWe joked around, we're like,\nwell, how much money you got?\n\n208\n00:10:00.158 --> 00:10:01.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I need all of it, right?\n\n209\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.190\nSo you can probably see Dan, the more\nmoney you pay, a lot of times, what?\n\n210\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.930\nThe more bandwidth?\n\n211\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely.\n\n212\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.526\nNow that's not always true.\n\n213\n00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:12.080\nT1's are expensive and\nthey don't give you a ton of bandwidth,\n\n214\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.680\nlike cable will give you more, but it's\nlike a leese line, it's dedicated to you.\n\n215\n00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.569\nSo there are pros and\n\n216\n00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:21.128\ncons to the different types of Internet\nconnections types that you can get into,\n\n217\n00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:24.921\nbut typically you're model is, the more\nmoney you pay, the more bandwidth you get.\n\n218\n00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:28.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Let's go ahead, and let's take\na second there, let's stop right there and\n\n219\n00:10:28.382 --> 00:10:29.958\ntalk about that for a second, right.\n\n220\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.446\nIn a residential area,\nwe have what is known as shared bandwidth.\n\n221\n00:10:32.446 --> 00:10:33.895\nI am actually,\nI'm glad you kind of mentioned this,\n\n222\n00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:37.320\ncuz it really does form the concepts\nbehind your Internet connection, right.\n\n223\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.470\nI get a piece of the pie [LAUGH] when\nwe talk about residential, right?\n\n224\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.790\nAnd I like pie, right?\n\n225\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.750\nThe more pie that I want, the more\nmoney I have to pay to basically use or\n\n226\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.890\neat more of that pie to\nhave more bandwidth.\n\n227\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.170\nIn a business type line,\nyeah you're right.\n\n228\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.240\nYou might have lower bandwidth, so\n\n229\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.680\nslower speeds, but it's yours,\nyou share it with nobody.\n\n230\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.830\nSo, in the end, you might see\nsome very good dedicated speeds\n\n231\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.340\nthat don't fluctuate because you get that\ndedicated bandwidth to your business.\n\n232\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.030\nSo I'm actually glad you mentioned that.\n\n233\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.370\nSo, there are two different\nthings to keep in mind,\n\n234\n00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.280\nin your home environment typically\nit's gonna be a shared bandwidth, and\n\n235\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.380\nyou have pool of residential houses or\nlocations all\n\n236\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.930\nconnected to the same network, and that's\nwhy you see speeds fluctuate, right?\n\n237\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.000\nDuring the midnight hour, you might notice\nthat hey, I get a lot of speed, right?\n\n238\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.051\nBut, when I come home at 5 o'clock or 6\no'clock when everybody else is getting off\n\n239\n00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:33.560\nof work, man, my speed just tanks, right?\n\n240\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.740\nSo the difference between a dedicated\nbandwidth at a higher cost doesn't\n\n241\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.190\nnecessarily mean a higher speed, but\nat the same time, shared bandwidth.\n\n242\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.940\nYou could pay a higher cost to\npotentially get the higher speed.\n\n243\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.210\nAll right, so some of the basics that we\nwanna kinda set up here first before we\n\n244\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.690\ndive into these connection types.\n\n245\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.812\nI know, Dan,\nI kinda went off the beaten path here, but\n\n246\n00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:55.416\nit is kind of important to understand\nwhat you can see out there.\n\n247\n00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:58.682\nBecause a lot of times, you really can't\nsee this, right, it's behind the scenes\n\n248\n00:11:58.682 --> 00:12:01.950\nand if you're just first getting into\nnetworking, it can be a little confusing.\n\n249\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.920\nSo now let's dive into\nthe connection types, all right.\n\n250\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.030\nOne of the very first ones that they talk\nabout is a cable connection, all right.\n\n251\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.196\nA cable connection is a very, very common\ncommunication type because of the fact\n\n252\n00:12:12.196 --> 00:12:16.195\nthat we, primarily every body like\ncable television to begin with, right.\n\n253\n00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:20.099\nYour getting things like your phone\nthrough a coaxial implementation that runs\n\n254\n00:12:20.099 --> 00:12:21.180\ninto your house.\n\n255\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.794\nWell, hey voice doesn't take\na lot of bandwidth, right,\n\n256\n00:12:24.794 --> 00:12:26.467\nto be able to communicate.\n\n257\n00:12:26.467 --> 00:12:30.508\nIn fact the longest time we were\ntalking about 56 Kay lines,\n\n258\n00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:35.326\n56 kilobytes per second, it was more\nthan enough to carry your voice and\n\n259\n00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:38.180\nthen you can also put data on it.\n\n260\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.170\nCable television, again, or\ncable connections keep in mind,\n\n261\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.370\nwhat happens is you typically\nhave some kind of cable modem and\n\n262\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.960\nWhat it's responsible for,\nis essentially splitting the signal.\n\n263\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.850\nYour Internet connection goes into\nyour computer, typically whatever\n\n264\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.890\nthe device is that's connected, a lot of\ntimes it's a home router, if you will, and\n\n265\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.540\nthen that splits the connection between\nmultiple devices within your network.\n\n266\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.940\nYour cable runs into\nthe back of the top box,\n\n267\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.480\nessentially gives you access to the cable,\nyour television side of it and\n\n268\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.060\nthen also on top of that,\nyour telephone lines.\n\n269\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.750\nAll right, now,\n\n270\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.165\nI want you to know we've talked about some\nof the cable types in the past episode.\n\n271\n00:13:13.165 --> 00:13:18.967\nRJ-6 is a common connector today,\nit used to be RG-59, today, it's RG-6, to\n\n272\n00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:24.545\nkind of tie those together quite literally\nwith the cables, those technologies.\n\n273\n00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:29.049\nNow some of the other ones that they call\nout, Dan, and I'm gonna do three of these\n\n274\n00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:33.049\nin one slide because it's all about\ncommunicating over the PSTN lines.\n\n275\n00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:36.400\nThere's actually three technologies out\nthere that kinda do this, all right?\n\n276\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.570\nThey call out dial-up,\nthey call out DSL and they call out ISDN.\n\n277\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.142\nSo what the heck are we talking about.\n\n278\n00:13:43.142 --> 00:13:47.550\nWell, dial-up you guys have probably\nhave seen or heard about, some of\n\n279\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.470\nyou younger whipper snappers out there\nmight say my gosh, don't mention dial-up.\n\n280\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.800\nI can't image those speeds.\n\n281\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.033\n&gt;&gt; Or they're going dial-up?\n\n282\n00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:55.950\n&gt;&gt; Dial-up [LAUGH], that's right.\n\n283\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.770\n&gt;&gt; What's a dial?\n\n284\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.786\nWhy would you, dial, like a phone?\n\n285\n00:13:58.786 --> 00:13:59.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's funny.\n\n286\n00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.430\nWhen we took our sons to Universal Studios\nand they had a dial-up phone,\n\n287\n00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.414\npush button phone.\n\n288\n00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:04.928\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n289\n00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:06.360\n&gt;&gt; We go walk around the corner,\nI was like,\n\n290\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.844\nhoney I didn't know they\nhad a museum out here.\n\n291\n00:14:08.844 --> 00:14:10.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, yeah, and that's the case, right?\n\n292\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.560\nThis is because up until the 80s,\nand again we still use it today,\n\n293\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.400\nbut up until the 80s what was so\nprevalent with communication technologies.\n\n294\n00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.704\nRight, our public switch\ntelephone network lines, right.\n\n295\n00:14:22.704 --> 00:14:24.310\nWe've talked about them in other episodes.\n\n296\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.180\nThe plain old television, I keep saying\nthat television, telephone service.\n\n297\n00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.850\nPOTS lines, right.\n\n298\n00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.050\nPrevalent everywhere.\n\n299\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.110\nWell they found out that, hey,\nit doesn't take a lot of bandwidth\n\n300\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.700\nto move voice communications across that\ncopper-based media, so let's go ahead and\n\n301\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.900\nlet's put data on it, all right.\n\n302\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.260\nSo let's go ahead and take a look and\nkinda recap when we talk about dial-up.\n\n303\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.650\nAnd you can see right here,\nthese are the three that I was mentioning,\n\n304\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.790\nagain, Dial-up, ISDN, and DSL.\n\n305\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.290\nNow, keep in mind that our computers they\nspeak digital communications, right.\n\n306\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.230\nWe talk about binary 1s and 0s.\n\n307\n00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:00.510\nWell, it's kind of interesting,\nyour public switch telephone networks,\n\n308\n00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.230\nthese are circuit switching technologies.\n\n309\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.030\nThese are what we talk about essentially\na dedicated connection between\n\n310\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.980\neach endpoint is brought up,\nbrought online, then you communicate.\n\n311\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.600\nAnd then once the communication is done,\nthat connection, that circuit is tore down\n\n312\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.480\nand then it goes back into, again,\na pool of additional communications.\n\n313\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.260\nNow, DSL relatively low cost,\nlow speed type of networking.\n\n314\n00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.169\nKeep in mind that it is used especially\nfor things like, in areas where maybe it's\n\n315\n00:15:29.169 --> 00:15:31.947\nemerging countries where they\nhave telephone systems but\n\n316\n00:15:31.947 --> 00:15:35.648\nthey can't afford lay fiber optic cabling\nor maybe even copper based media.\n\n317\n00:15:35.648 --> 00:15:39.075\nAnd not to say that's that not here in the\nUnited States too, where maybe you've got\n\n318\n00:15:39.075 --> 00:15:42.422\na mountainous area where they've got a lot\nof telephones run, but you know what?\n\n319\n00:15:42.422 --> 00:15:45.272\nThey don't have a lot of\n[LAUGH] cable-based media or\n\n320\n00:15:45.272 --> 00:15:48.073\nfiber optic media that is\nactually laid there too.\n\n321\n00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:51.555\nSo it at least brings some kind of\nnetworking communications to areas\n\n322\n00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:53.362\nthat otherwise wouldn't have it.\n\n323\n00:15:53.362 --> 00:15:55.941\nSo it is a solution for a lot of people.\n\n324\n00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:58.759\nDan mentioned this in another episode,\nwhere he was working for\n\n325\n00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:01.013\na company that did a lot\nof data disaster recovery.\n\n326\n00:16:01.013 --> 00:16:05.022\nAnd when your packet switching networks\nfail, a lot of times you've got phone\n\n327\n00:16:05.022 --> 00:16:09.093\nlines in place, your circuit switching\nnetwork, so they would do things where\n\n328\n00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:13.430\nthey would bring banks of these modems\ninto disaster recovery situations, right?\n\n329\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.100\nSo remember, a modem is\na modulator-demodulator, right, and again,\n\n330\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.370\nthat's the modulation of a digital\nsignal into an analog signal and\n\n331\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.970\nplaced across that PSTN line.\n\n332\n00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.235\n&gt;&gt; I had a friend of mine\nactually created his own ISP.\n\n333\n00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:30.903\nHe got a leased line, and then created\na RAS server, a remote access server for\n\n334\n00:16:30.903 --> 00:16:32.480\ndial-up in a rural area.\n\n335\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.415\nHe was making money,\nthis was in high school.\n\n336\n00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:35.918\nHe did it in high school.\n\n337\n00:16:35.918 --> 00:16:36.688\n&gt;&gt; That's great, that's great.\n\n338\n00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:38.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, his last name was Gates.\n\n339\n00:16:38.305 --> 00:16:39.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The first name was William.\n\n340\n00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:41.645\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and you can do that.\n\n341\n00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:44.790\nAnd that's one of the great things\nabout dial-up is the fact that,\n\n342\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.090\nit does allow you some\nkind of communication.\n\n343\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.050\nNow there are other digital signals\nas well that we go through modulation\n\n344\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.860\ntechniques as well, and one of the other\nones that we have up here is the ISDN.\n\n345\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.095\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nagain the diagram, we've got ISDN.\n\n346\n00:16:59.095 --> 00:17:01.680\nThat is the Integrated\nServices Digital Network and\n\n347\n00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.600\nwhen we talk about ISDN, there's really\na couple of different types, right?\n\n348\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.050\nOne of the things that we mentioned, and\n\n349\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.840\nthis is where we kind of get into\nwhat's known as a channelized service.\n\n350\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.580\nSee, with your Internet connection types,\nto get more bandwidth or to\n\n351\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:20.780\nprovide more bandwidth, right, a lot more\ndata that I can send across those cables.\n\n352\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.760\nWe take multiple individual channels, and\nwe aggregate them or bond them together.\n\n353\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.920\nNow what's the benefit?\n\n354\n00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.710\nWell that benefits you, the customers,\nbecause they can pay only for\n\n355\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.570\nthe level of bandwidth what they need,\nright.\n\n356\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.960\nI would need a lower bandwidth.\n\n357\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.075\nI might get a single channel.\n\n358\n00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:36.750\nI might get just a few channels, right?\n\n359\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.740\nI'm a business,\nI need a lot more channels.\n\n360\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.590\nWell, we can bond more of those\ncommunication highways together and\n\n361\n00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.480\ngive you more speed.\n\n362\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.380\nAnd ISDN is one that does that.\n\n363\n00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.190\nIn fact,\nISDN has two different types, right?\n\n364\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.520\nThey have what's known as\nprimary rate interface.\n\n365\n00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.350\nYou might hear it called PRI ISDN so\nthat would be for your acronyms of course,\n\n366\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.810\nalphabet soup and the exam,\n\n367\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.710\nthat will be the Primary Rate Interface\nIntegrated Services Digital Network.\n\n368\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.460\nNow this is one that you typically\ndon't see inside a residential areas.\n\n369\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.100\nThis is more use for\nthings like businesses, and\n\n370\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.310\ndefinitely inside the telecommunications\nnetwork you might the TELCO,\n\n371\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.230\nthat turn TELCO just an abbreviated\nform of telecommunications.\n\n372\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:19.030\nBecause it provide such high bandwidth,\nright?\n\n373\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.848\nEach individual channel\nwithin ISDN network, and\n\n374\n00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:26.040\nother technologies out there on\nthe Internet are 64 kilobits per second,\n\n375\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.396\nright, you say wow,\n64 kilobits per second, watch out.\n\n376\n00:18:29.396 --> 00:18:30.567\n&gt;&gt; They're beating\nthe pants off the dialer.\n\n377\n00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:32.365\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n378\n00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:36.436\nWe are definitely moving there, and\nwhat this would do essentially,\n\n379\n00:18:36.436 --> 00:18:38.580\nwas give you 23 of those channels.\n\n380\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.112\nIt'd give you like a 1.544 megabit\ntransfer speed, which the data doesn't\n\n381\n00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:47.590\nreally sound like a lot, cuz we have\nbroadband and high bandwidth connections.\n\n382\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.681\nBut when you talk about going\nfrom 56k availability to\n\n383\n00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:58.746\n23 times that to 1.544 megabits,\nit was a blinding speed,\n\n384\n00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:03.780\nif you will,\nwith a blinding price point as well.\n\n385\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.540\nSo no primary rate interface, I don't\nthink really you have to know the inner\n\n386\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.130\nworkings here, we just kind of mention it\nas we've talked about in past episodes.\n\n387\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.160\nKind of getting you ready, if you\nare gonna move into the Network+ as well.\n\n388\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.180\nNow the other ISDN that we\nhave is what is knows as BRI.\n\n389\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.510\n[LAUGH] We have PRI and BRI, right?\n\n390\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:26.310\nWell, these are two friends holding hands,\nno, BRI is the Basic Rate Interface.\n\n391\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.873\nRight, when we say BRI or\nBasic Rate Interface,\n\n392\n00:19:28.873 --> 00:19:32.997\nthis is the one that you would see inside\nof your residential lines and really,\n\n393\n00:19:32.997 --> 00:19:34.890\nyou could see it in businesses too.\n\n394\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.080\nBut this is one because of lower cost,\n\n395\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.760\nyou would see connected to your\nresidential base networks.\n\n396\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.300\nAnd Basic Rate Interface,\nif you will, this is 128k.\n\n397\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.183\nAnd I know guys out there, guys and\ngals by today's standards,\n\n398\n00:19:48.183 --> 00:19:53.052\nthat doesn't seem like a lot of bandwidth,\nbut when you say that, hey we had 56k,\n\n399\n00:19:53.052 --> 00:19:56.756\nright, you can talk to some of\nthe old timers out there that say,\n\n400\n00:19:56.756 --> 00:19:59.381\nhey I remember when we had 28.8, right?\n\n401\n00:19:59.381 --> 00:20:05.325\nAnd when I got a 56k modem, my gosh,\nwe're talking about double the speeds.\n\n402\n00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:06.519\n&gt;&gt; I remember 14.4.\n\n403\n00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:07.846\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n404\n00:20:07.846 --> 00:20:08.588\n&gt;&gt; I had 14.4.\n\n405\n00:20:08.588 --> 00:20:12.503\n&gt;&gt; And what's kinda interesting about\nthat Dan, is when you say 14.4,\n\n406\n00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:15.534\n28.8, 56k,\nyou could kinda see it doubling, and\n\n407\n00:20:15.534 --> 00:20:19.030\nISDN was one of those that\nwould double it yet again.\n\n408\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.190\nSo know the Basic Rate Interface,\nagain kinda know the speeds,\n\n409\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.720\n128 kilobits per second.\n\n410\n00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.070\nAs you go into Network+,\nwe'll get a little bit more in depth.\n\n411\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.190\nWe'll talk about things like bear\nchannels and delta channels.\n\n412\n00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.170\nI think that's beyond the scope\nof this exam right here.\n\n413\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.870\nAll right, now that being said,\nhere's one that you probably have seen and\n\n414\n00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.540\nis still heavily used as well, and\nthat's the last one in our list here.\n\n415\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.240\nSo far we've talked about dial-up,\nISDN and that is DSL,\n\n416\n00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.613\nthat is the Digital Subscriber Line.\n\n417\n00:20:45.613 --> 00:20:49.834\nWe talk about Digital Subscriber Line,\nkeep in mind, this is also another\n\n418\n00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:53.930\nform of those digital communications\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n419\n00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.787\nThere's a couple of different kinds of,\n\n420\n00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.440\nactually there's quite a few\ndifferent kinds out there but\n\n421\n00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.955\nthere are, really there's one that we\nused more than all, and that's ADSL.\n\n422\n00:21:01.955 --> 00:21:05.021\nYou'll see there's all kind, VDSL,\nthere's very high speed DSL.\n\n423\n00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:07.790\nActually, I think it might even be VHDSL.\n\n424\n00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.914\nRight, the ones that we're looking at,\nagain,\n\n425\n00:21:09.914 --> 00:21:12.100\nwith the Digital Subscriber Line\nis gonna be ADSL.\n\n426\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.021\nThis is the one that's kinda common\ninside of residential areas.\n\n427\n00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:16.966\nAnd what do we mean by ADSL?\n\n428\n00:21:16.966 --> 00:21:19.990\nWe're talking about asymmetric\ndigital subscriber line.\n\n429\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.630\nAnd the asymmetric nature of it\nwhich means, that your downloads and\n\n430\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.922\nyour uploads are different bandwidth,\nthey're different speeds, right?\n\n431\n00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:36.744\nYou might hear something called\nupstream versus downstream, all right?\n\n432\n00:21:36.744 --> 00:21:38.267\nIf we say downstream,\n\n433\n00:21:38.267 --> 00:21:43.280\nwhat we're talking about is from\nour computer out to the Internet.\n\n434\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.250\nRight, and what that would be is\na digital to analog conversion.\n\n435\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.120\nWe talk about those modems,\nthat's downstream,\n\n436\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.010\nthat's from let's say Dan's\ncomputer out there to the Internet.\n\n437\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.962\nUpstream means, it's coming from\nthe provider into your network, right.\n\n438\n00:21:55.962 --> 00:21:58.538\nAnd that is over the analog base network,\n\n439\n00:21:58.538 --> 00:22:03.380\nbasically converting it through\nthe DSL modem into the digital signal.\n\n440\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.030\nThe other thing I might mention too about\nyour DSL, Digital Subscriber Line is,\n\n441\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.740\nunlike things like cable television,\nand your dial-up,\n\n442\n00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.000\nit actually has a splitter that splits\nyour signal, your digital signal,\n\n443\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.890\nif you will, going into your computer\nversus your telephone signal there.\n\n444\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.204\nLet's see, anything else that\nI think we might have to use.\n\n445\n00:22:27.204 --> 00:22:31.530\nUse the PTSN, the pots lines,\nkeep in mind, that there's a relatively,\n\n446\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.932\nof all the DSL types you'll learn about,\n\n447\n00:22:33.932 --> 00:22:38.549\nit's definitely one of the shortest ones\nwhen it comes to the communications.\n\n448\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.217\nAll right, so those are the three,\nDan, like I said,\n\n449\n00:22:42.217 --> 00:22:45.964\nwe got kinda since it's digital,\nanalog all going over the same technology,\n\n450\n00:22:45.964 --> 00:22:48.443\nit kinda took care of that\none all in the same slide.\n\n451\n00:22:48.443 --> 00:22:52.354\nCuz to me, it kinda makes sense that\nif there's a commonality behind them,\n\n452\n00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:55.690\nthen it makes a little bit more\nsense to put them all in one.\n\n453\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.600\nHowever, I'm looking at the time clock,\nand we got a lot more to go but\n\n454\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.670\nI'm not sure that we have\nthe availability in this episode.\n\n455\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, definitely,\nwe can definitely do a part two,\n\n456\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.710\nthat's not a problem\naround here at ITProTV.\n\n457\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.580\nWe would love to do those, and I know I\nlike doing these because it is all about\n\n458\n00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.660\nnetworking and\nits my wheelhouse, I enjoy it.\n\n459\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.130\nHopefully, you are as well, but like the\nman has been alluding too, it is time for\n\n460\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.120\nus to sign off.\n\n461\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.210\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n462\n00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n463\n00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.257\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n464\n00:23:20.257 --> 00:23:27.265\n[MUSIC]\n\n465\n00:23:27.265 -->

00:00:08.200\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.780\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.541\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:15.914\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:17.557\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:20.419\nin today's episode we're\ncontinuing on with more A+ series,\n\n9\n00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.450\nactually continuing our conversation\non different internet connection types.\n\n10\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.005\nA lot of fun there.\n\n11\n00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.930\nAnd joining us in the studio for those\nrevelries, our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.138\nWes, welcome back, sir how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:31.190\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going good.\n\n14\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.520\nGood to be back here again, because I\ncertainly talked a lot in the first one,\n\n15\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.220\nthat's for sure.\n\n16\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.008\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; You bumping your gums.\n\n17\n00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:37.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n18\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.540\nAnd the first thing I\nwanna kinda talk about,\n\n19\n00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350\njust a quick little recap on what\nwe talked about in the first part.\n\n20\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.080\nRemember we were kinda letting you\nknow what you could expect behind\n\n21\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.800\nthe scenes when it comes to the Internet.\n\n22\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.540\nI was telling Dan this before we started.\n\n23\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.475\nI remember coming out of A+ thinking\nthat this Internet service provider,\n\n24\n00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:56.656\nthere's one person out there and they're\nproviding service to everybody and,\n\n25\n00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:00.550\nI've gotta have access to the backbone\nof the Internet only to learn that.\n\n26\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.377\nWell, it's really divided\nup in a hierarchy, and\n\n27\n00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:04.070\nthat there are different connection types.\n\n28\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.226\nWe talked about the difference between\ncircuit switching and packet switching.\n\n29\n00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:08.845\nBriefly mentioned cell switching,\n\n30\n00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:11.618\nyou'll definitely learn more of\nthat if you get into Net Plus.\n\n31\n00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:15.071\nAnd then we talked about,\nif we can look here at the diagram,\n\n32\n00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:19.407\nremember we talked about three primary or\nthree of these I guess you would say\n\n33\n00:01:19.407 --> 00:01:24.240\ncircuit switching type communications that\nreally are a digital to analog signal.\n\n34\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.172\nRemember dial-up?\n\n35\n00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.560\nISDN and DSL all right?\n\n36\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.082\nAnd if any of these don't sound\nfamiliar to you, ladies and\n\n37\n00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:32.907\ngentleman out there, go ahead and\ngo back to the first part here and\n\n38\n00:01:32.907 --> 00:01:34.689\nthen we'll see you back in part two here.\n\n39\n00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.962\nNow, moving on we gotta talk\nabout another type of connection,\n\n40\n00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:41.160\ninternet connection out there and\nthat is fiber.\n\n41\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.812\nAnd sometimes you can see today you can\nsee fiber connected straight to your home.\n\n42\n00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:52.690\nFor the longest time, the fiber optic\ncommunications have been something that's\n\n43\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.460\nreally just seen in the ISP.\n\n44\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.327\nSo for instance here, SONET,\nthat we have on our screen,\n\n45\n00:01:57.327 --> 00:02:01.776\nit's the Synchronous Optical Networking if\nyou will, and that's what it's called here\n\n46\n00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:05.756\nin the States by the American National\nStandards Institute the ones they oversee\n\n47\n00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:07.067\nthe standard if you will.\n\n48\n00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.934\nIn our European countries out\nthere we have what's known\n\n49\n00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.393\nthe International\nTelecommunications Union.\n\n50\n00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:15.607\nAnd what they call it is\nthe plesiochronous digital hierarchy,\n\n51\n00:02:15.607 --> 00:02:16.490\nall right.\n\n52\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.051\nSo again kind of synonymous terms\nthere When it comes to our digital or\n\n53\n00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.109\nfiber optic communications.\n\n54\n00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.464\nBut Dan, like I said, for a long time this\nis the only place you would really find\n\n55\n00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:30.080\nthis is well,\nreally just inside of your ISPs.\n\n56\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.870\nWhy?\nWell, let's go ahead and\n\n57\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.360\nkind of go back to briefly a topic that we\ntalked about when we were talking about\n\n58\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.220\nmedia types in another episode, right.\n\n59\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.966\nWe had mentioned Single-mode fiber,\nmulti-mode fiber.\n\n60\n00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:44.620\nIf you guys aren't aware of the specifics\ndefinitely go back and check that out,\n\n61\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.647\nbut keep in mind,\n\n62\n00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:49.959\nit really comes down to the overall\ndistances on which fiber mode you choose\n\n63\n00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.150\nand how they transmit the communications\nacross the cabling all right.\n\n64\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.125\nNow, when we look at internet connection\ntypes, right, we're talking about,\n\n65\n00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.988\nprimarily, you're talking about single\nmode communications just because of\n\n66\n00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:03.793\nthe long transmissions distances.\n\n67\n00:03:03.793 --> 00:03:07.850\nRemember that one of the big differences\nbetween multi mode fiber, and\n\n68\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.583\nthe single mode fiber is really that the\ntransmission, or the length I should say,\n\n69\n00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:17.198\nof the cable, and it's potential for\nhigh amounts of bandwidth.\n\n70\n00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:22.066\nYour single most fire bursts could reach\ncabling distances up to 40 kilometers on\n\n71\n00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:23.048\na single cable.\n\n72\n00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:27.169\nThat's 40,000 meters, that's a pretty good\nstretch when you consider without having\n\n73\n00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.360\nto use repeaters, right?\n\n74\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.960\nAnd a repeater is nothing more than\nsomething that receives a signal,\n\n75\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.990\ndoesn't matter if it's an electromagnetic\nenergy through a copper based media or\n\n76\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.610\nit's an optical light source\nthrough a fiber optic media.\n\n77\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.520\nIt regenerates the signal and\nit allows it to extend that signal or\n\n78\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.070\nthat transmission across the full length\nof an additional form of whatever your\n\n79\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.900\nmedia is, whether it's copper based or\nwhether it's fiber optic based.\n\n80\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.310\nSo that's one of the reasons you see that\nsingle mode cabling, a lot of times,\n\n81\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.480\nis, and we have some in our server closets\nas well, so don't let me confuse you.\n\n82\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.686\nWhen you have what's known as\nthe demarcation point, and\n\n83\n00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:02.207\nthat's probably something we\nshould just briefly mention here,\n\n84\n00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:04.157\nwhen we talk about Internet connections,\nright.\n\n85\n00:04:04.157 --> 00:04:07.180\nBecause we have the ISP side,\nyour carrier,\n\n86\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.772\nthe telecommunications provider,\ntheir network.\n\n87\n00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:15.720\nYou're not required to service you\nshouldn't have access to, legally.\n\n88\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.210\nAnd where that comes into your network and\n\n89\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.940\nmakes a connection to your network, that's\ncalled a demarc, or the demarcation point.\n\n90\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.031\nIt really divides up\nthe point of responsibility.\n\n91\n00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:31.050\nTo the Telcos provider side,\nthey're responsible for that network.\n\n92\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.450\nIf a cable's dug up they\nhave to come out and fix it.\n\n93\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.008\nHowever, on your business or\nresidential side of the demarcation point,\n\n94\n00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:44.155\nanything that happens on that side,\nyou're digging or\n\n95\n00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:47.259\nknocking a wall down and you cut the wire.\n\n96\n00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.709\nThat's gonna be you that's responsible for\nit, so I don't want you to\n\n97\n00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:56.383\nthink that we don't have single-mode\nfiber inside of our networks here,\n\n98\n00:04:56.383 --> 00:04:58.625\non that side of demarkation point.\n\n99\n00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.979\nBut primarily because\nthe transmission distance,\n\n100\n00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.140\nis single mode is what's\ngonna be used by your ISPs.\n\n101\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.990\nNow again, I mentioned a little\nbit about SONET, right?\n\n102\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.460\nIf we can go back to our diagram here I\ndo wanna just kinda talk about what kinda\n\n103\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.580\ntopology you're seeing here,\nmore of the specifics.\n\n104\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.189\nAgain, we'll get into the inside of Net+.\n\n105\n00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.905\nKeep in mind that Sonet is\na very high speed network,\n\n106\n00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:24.207\nwe're talking past 10 gigabit per second.\n\n107\n00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:28.120\nAnd again because of the larger bandwidth,\nit gives the ability for\n\n108\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.515\nthe ISPs to take multitudes of these\ncables, aggregate them together, and\n\n109\n00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:36.610\nwe're talking terabits of data\nwhich is mind boggling, right?\n\n110\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.009\nIn its capacity to send\ninformation across of it.\n\n111\n00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.055\nSONET is also a dual ring topology it's\none of the great things about in the fact\n\n112\n00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:47.480\nthat you have a primary and\nyou have a secondary ring.\n\n113\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.060\nAnd that allows for\na self healing fault tolerance.\n\n114\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.545\nFault tolerance, remember, is a way\nthat we can essentially continue to\n\n115\n00:05:56.545 --> 00:06:01.774\nfunction when there's a foreseeable\nFailure that happens, right?\n\n116\n00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:03.611\nIf we have two of something and one fails,\n\n117\n00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:06.310\nthe other one can take up\nwhere the last one left off.\n\n118\n00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.260\nAnd that's what you see in\nyour synchronous digital or\n\n119\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.990\nsynchronous optical networking.\n\n120\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.240\nKeep in mind it is a fiber\noptic based communication.\n\n121\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.280\nNow the other thing that you're also\nseeing in fiber optic communications is\n\n122\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.450\nthings like FiOS.\n\n123\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.341\nI think Verizon has FiOS and that's a\nresidential fiber optics that can give you\n\n124\n00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.830\na potential for a great amount of speed.\n\n125\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.330\nGoogle was another one.\n\n126\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.040\nHere in Gainesville,\nI wanna say it's about six years ago,\n\n127\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.431\nthey did a survey to see if people\nwould be on board with gigabit speeds.\n\n128\n00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:40.077\nAgain, sustained gigabit speeds over fiber\noptic communications for whatever reason,\n\n129\n00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:43.190\nwhatever bureaucracy or\nlegality it didn't happen.\n\n130\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.204\nAnd it's definitely in other cities too\nwhere Google is literally becoming the ISP\n\n131\n00:06:47.204 --> 00:06:50.480\nand bringing fiber optic communications\nright to your residence.\n\n132\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.491\nAnd again Verizon has things like FiOS\nagain which is a fiber optic service that\n\n133\n00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:56.450\nthey're providing too.\n\n134\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.863\nAt this point I wanna say on June of 2017,\nhere's a the little asterisk,\n\n135\n00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:06.443\nthe fine print, is that you really\nhave to check your community,\n\n136\n00:07:06.443 --> 00:07:08.544\nyour neighborhood, right?\n\n137\n00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:12.200\nYour region, and to see if it's\nsomething that is available.\n\n138\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.098\nTypically fiber optic communications\nare gonna be expensive, right?\n\n139\n00:07:15.098 --> 00:07:16.937\nYou're gonna have an expense,\n\n140\n00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:20.710\nit's gonna be a lot more expense\nover a copper based media.\n\n141\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.230\nCopper based media copper based devices\nthey're typically less expensive than\n\n142\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.710\ntheir fiber optic counterparts.\n\n143\n00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.060\nHowever, there's also pros and cons.\n\n144\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.880\nYou talk about ISDN you talk about\nDSL you talk about cable TV,\n\n145\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.934\neven dial up you're talking about\na copper based communication.\n\n146\n00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:38.988\nThey're susceptible to things like\nelectromagnetic interference which also\n\n147\n00:07:38.988 --> 00:07:43.560\nreduces the quality of the feed,\nthe quality of the communication as well.\n\n148\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.800\nAnd it reduces Is the price point too.\n\n149\n00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.870\nHowever fiber optic media, again,\n\n150\n00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.478\nthat the counter to that is the fact that\nit isn't susceptible to electromagnetic\n\n151\n00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:55.548\ninterference and\nit can give you a lot more bandwidth,\n\n152\n00:07:55.548 --> 00:08:00.052\na lot more speed, potential for better\nperformance if you will in the long run.\n\n153\n00:08:00.052 --> 00:08:03.851\nBut it usually comes at\na significant price point.\n\n154\n00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.982\nSo you are saying if it's available and\nyou have the means,\n\n155\n00:08:05.982 --> 00:08:07.184\nit's definitely the way to fly?\n\n156\n00:08:07.184 --> 00:08:08.705\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\nespecially if you're a gamer.\n\n157\n00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.385\nI mean, gamers want every bit\nof the bandwidth they can get.\n\n158\n00:08:11.385 --> 00:08:16.510\nMaybe not something you would\nlay inside your house, right?\n\n159\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.736\nA multi mode fiber just cuz\nof the fact that it is so\n\n160\n00:08:19.736 --> 00:08:22.190\ndarn expansive, or can be for sure.\n\n161\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.241\nIt's definitely coming down\nin price over the years.\n\n162\n00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:27.040\n&gt;&gt; Up in availability.\n\n163\n00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.690\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n164\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.480\nYou know, we showed you a fiber\noptic communication or, I'm sorry,\n\n165\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.990\nin one of our PC connection episodes\nwe kind of looked at a fiber\n\n166\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.730\noptic cable that one of our\nother hosts cut, right?\n\n167\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.163\nWell about ten years ago,\n\n168\n00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:44.283\nyou wouldn't have thought about cutting\nthat cable just as a sheer price.\n\n169\n00:08:44.283 --> 00:08:48.901\nBut again price point's coming down, so\nit's something you're gonna see more and\n\n170\n00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:49.430\nmore of.\n\n171\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.380\nI predict as the future goes on, and\nI don't really think that I'm physic\n\n172\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.210\nby any means or\nhave any kind of esp going on.\n\n173\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.828\nIt's just one of those tell tale signs\nthat as they bring the price point down\n\n174\n00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:02.502\nin any technology, it becomes more\navailable to the public, it becomes more\n\n175\n00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:06.191\nfeasible and economical for people to\nhave and bring inside of their houses.\n\n176\n00:09:06.191 --> 00:09:09.960\nAll right, we've been talking\na lot about bounded media.\n\n177\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.013\nThis is the other thing,\n\n178\n00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:13.980\nbounded connections when we talk\nabout an Internet connection type.\n\n179\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.000\nAnd really when you talk about\nany kind of connection type,\n\n180\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.930\nremember there are two primary types.\n\n181\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.200\nThere's bounded media through some kind of\nphysical cable that has to make a physical\n\n182\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.130\nconnection between endpoints.\n\n183\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.310\nIt doesn't matter if it's copper-based\nmedium which is the most prevalent or\n\n184\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.430\nfiber optic communications,\nthere is a physical connection.\n\n185\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.582\nYou also have some of these connections\nthat are unbounded media, right?\n\n186\n00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:37.470\nThey're using some form of radiated\nenergy that allows for the communication.\n\n187\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.488\nAnd like we've mentioned in other\nepisodes, remember that sometimes there\n\n188\n00:09:41.488 --> 00:09:44.845\nare limitations and\nbeing able to lay physical cables, right?\n\n189\n00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:49.090\nMaybe it might be just location,\nlocation, location as they say, right?\n\n190\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:55.110\nIt might be the fact that maybe you\nwork in a location that has some kind of\n\n191\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.980\nhistorical significance and it's actually\ncontrolled by your local county, right?\n\n192\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.211\nIf I'm working on a historical site\nI can't necessarily go in, even if\n\n193\n00:10:04.211 --> 00:10:09.089\nI own the place, or if I manage the place,\nand start knocking down walls, right?\n\n194\n00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:10.850\nThat might not be feasible.\n\n195\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.642\nSo radiated energy and unbounded media\nwireless type communications are getting\n\n196\n00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:17.354\nto the point here do have their place.\n\n197\n00:10:17.354 --> 00:10:18.427\nAnd they're really,\n\n198\n00:10:18.427 --> 00:10:21.934\nreally common day, especially when\nwe talk about ease of installation.\n\n199\n00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:24.684\nWe don't have to worry about, hey,\nwhat kind of cable do I have?\n\n200\n00:10:24.684 --> 00:10:26.097\nWhat are the links I have to run?\n\n201\n00:10:26.097 --> 00:10:29.294\nDo I really wanna get in to the attic,\nget the fiberglass all over me,\n\n202\n00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:31.130\ndo I wanna get under the house for sure?\n\n203\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.849\n&gt;&gt; That's an easy question to answer.\n\n204\n00:10:31.849 --> 00:10:32.813\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n205\n00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:33.928\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:33.928 --> 00:10:34.831\n&gt;&gt; Dan and I joke sometimes,\n\n207\n00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.934\nthat's the reason we got into\nIT in the first place, right?\n\n208\n00:10:36.934 --> 00:10:38.893\nTo get out of the construction.\n\n209\n00:10:38.893 --> 00:10:40.371\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You've been to Florida in the Summer?\n\n210\n00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:41.145\nNot fun.\n[LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:41.645\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n212\n00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:44.454\nA lot of cold showers after laying cables\n\n213\n00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:45.890\nand fiberglass.\n\n214\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.970\nSo, that's one of the benefits, right?\n\n215\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.110\nOne of the benefits to wireless\ncommunications is we don't really have to\n\n216\n00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.760\nworry about that.\n\n217\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.440\nBut again, wireless communications aren't\nwithout their drawbacks as well, right?\n\n218\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.250\nWith a wireless communication yes,\n\n219\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.610\nsure you don't have to worry about\nlimitations of the cables themselves, but\n\n220\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.020\nyou also have to worry about\nradio frequency interference.\n\n221\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.890\nRight now we have obstacles\nbecause just because we don't\n\n222\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.359\nhave the ability to lay the cables and\n\n223\n00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:12.750\nnow we have a wireless communication,\nthat wall still might present a problem.\n\n224\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.920\nYou still can't knock it down,\n\n225\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.800\nbut again the radiated energy might not\nmake it through those locations as well.\n\n226\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.010\nNow that's in your local networks.\n\n227\n00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.730\nKeep in mind,\nthere are also unbounded communications.\n\n228\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.900\nWe talk about mobile phones.\n\n229\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.120\nWe talk about cellular communications\nthat we have to keep in mind as well.\n\n230\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.890\nSo there are some that we wanna mention\nhere when it comes to internet connection\n\n231\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.220\ntypes, right?\n\n232\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.005\nFirst one I think of is satellite.\n\n233\n00:11:34.005 --> 00:11:35.340\nI've got a little picture here.\n\n234\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.760\nAnd again, you guys and gals out there\nmaybe have seen satellite before.\n\n235\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.820\nWe use satellite almost on a daily basis\nwhether you realize it or not, right?\n\n236\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.690\nIf you've got a GPS system in your phone,\n\n237\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.170\nyou're using satellite whether\nyou knew it or not, right?\n\n238\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.170\nThe global positioning system is an\nexample of a satellite communication that\n\n239\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.950\nsometimes we take for\ngranted as being satellite.\n\n240\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:04.020\nIt was former military as a way\nessentially to triangulate\n\n241\n00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:08.855\nthree or\nmore of the satellites that are in orbit,\n\n242\n00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:11.655\nif you will,\nto focus on pinpoint your position.\n\n243\n00:12:11.655 --> 00:12:14.245\nHence the term global positioning system.\n\n244\n00:12:14.245 --> 00:12:20.933\nThere are 24 of these satellites that\nare in operation 365 days a year.\n\n245\n00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:23.335\nThere are three that\nare on standby on backup,\n\n246\n00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:27.480\njust in case one fails the other\none can take over, right?\n\n247\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.670\nSo you're using a satellite communication,\nwhether you have an Internet connection or\n\n248\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.360\nnot, anytime you use a mobile device\nthat has some kind of GPS system.\n\n249\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.310\n&gt;&gt; Just a fun fact, I actually use to\ndeliver these satellites to NASA so\n\n250\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.544\nthey could launch them into the sky.\n\n251\n00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:45.240\nFrom Boeing, we'd pick them up from\nBoeing where they were manufactured and\n\n252\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.080\nthen bring them to either Cape Canaveral\nor Air Force Base in California.\n\n253\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.650\nVery fun, it was very cool.\n\n254\n00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.770\nAnd to know that I kinda had a hand\nin the fact that we get to use GPSs.\n\n255\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, by day time here Dan is\ndefinitely one of the best hosts we\n\n256\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.280\nhave at IT Pro TV.\n\n257\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.116\nBy night he is Neil Armstrong.\n\n258\n00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:02.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wish.\n\n259\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.455\n&gt;&gt; So that's amazing, that is great.\n\n260\n00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:07.504\nThat's really cool to be able to do that,\nto go into a place like that.\n\n261\n00:13:07.504 --> 00:13:08.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was fun.\n\n262\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.100\n&gt;&gt; So you can see we're using satellite\ncommunications sometimes when we don't\n\n263\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.758\neven realize it.\n\n264\n00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.134\nAnd again, like I said,\n\n265\n00:13:13.134 --> 00:13:17.470\nthat is regardless whether you have\nInternet service provider or not.\n\n266\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.355\nHowever, with satellite\ncommunications keep in mind that,\n\n267\n00:13:20.355 --> 00:13:22.747\nyou can have satellite\nInternet connection type.\n\n268\n00:13:22.747 --> 00:13:25.215\nThere are some pros and\ncons to that as well, right?\n\n269\n00:13:25.215 --> 00:13:29.340\nIt's a radiated energy, just like WiFi\nthat you have in your home networks.\n\n270\n00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.432\nLet's talk about the benefit first,\nwe don't always have to be so\n\n271\n00:13:32.432 --> 00:13:33.307\npessimistic here, right?\n\n272\n00:13:33.307 --> 00:13:35.370\nLet's talk about the benefits again,\nall right?\n\n273\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.290\nIt is another one of those one's where\nit isn't feasible in areas to lay\n\n274\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.685\nphysical cabling.\n\n275\n00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:45.791\nI don't care if it's fiber optic media,\na lot of times your ISPs might not be\n\n276\n00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:50.157\nrunning a copper based media just because\nof some of the general limitations, so\n\n277\n00:13:50.157 --> 00:13:53.134\nthey typically will lay\nfiber optic communications.\n\n278\n00:13:53.134 --> 00:13:54.740\nBut that might be expensive, right?\n\n279\n00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.590\nI know that we've got one of our\nhost that lives in an area that, for\n\n280\n00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.010\nlack of a better word,\nreally in the middle of a pasture, right?\n\n281\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.020\nIt's cow town, right?\n\n282\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.345\nThere's a lot of farms out there and\nstuff, a lot of space and\n\n283\n00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:09.740\nISPs just can't justify spending the cost\nto bring five people and the whole\n\n284\n00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.850\ncity some kind of Internet connection,\nso he has to use satellite, right?\n\n285\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.180\nAnd that's where you get benefit.\n\n286\n00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.780\nThe fact that we have a direct\nline of sight communication.\n\n287\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.360\nWe've talked about that before and I do\nwanna briefly mention that most wireless\n\n288\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.620\nis an LOS communication which means\nyou need some kind of a line of sight\n\n289\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.340\nbetween the transceiver and\nthe receiver, if you will.\n\n290\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.756\nOr the transmitter,\nexcuse me, I say transceiver.\n\n291\n00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:33.430\nTransceiver is what the chips that\nare in your network adaptors.\n\n292\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.370\nAnd I say that cuz they transmit and\nreceive, but the transmitter and\n\n293\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.540\nthe receiver, right?\n\n294\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.600\nSatellite, this line-of-sight\ncommunication is the curvature\n\n295\n00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.120\nof the earth.\n\n296\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.410\nSo it is the farthest,\n\n297\n00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.190\nthe longest, line-of-sight communication\nthat we have on the planet today.\n\n298\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.800\nAnd, in fact, obviously, we're using\nthings like the Hubble satellite, right?\n\n299\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That can go however many millions\n\n300\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:58.110\nof miles out there in space and can\nshow us just interstellar space, right?\n\n301\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.399\nKeep in mind there's a drawback too,\nright?\n\n302\n00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:03.642\nWith that extreme geographical distance,\nyes, we get the benefit but\n\n303\n00:15:03.642 --> 00:15:05.550\nwe also get latency, right?\n\n304\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:10.369\nThere's tendency for it to be fairly\ndelayed and a limited amount of bandwidth.\n\n305\n00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:14.963\nWhich means, bandwidth again is the\ntheoretical capacity of a communication\n\n306\n00:15:14.963 --> 00:15:16.860\nchannel to send information.\n\n307\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.940\nHow much could I send if I was to\nsend communications over that wire?\n\n308\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.423\nSo for instance,\nwe got a cup of coffee here.\n\n309\n00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:27.370\nIf you look the full cup,\nthat would be its bandwidth,\n\n310\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.750\nthat would be its capacity, right?\n\n311\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.400\nHow much I've actually have in the cup,\nright, that's what known as throughput.\n\n312\n00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.070\nWhen we say throughput,\nthat's what's actually happening.\n\n313\n00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.880\nSo how much coffee I have in\nthe cup versus how much it can hold\n\n314\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.440\nwould be the difference between\nbandwidth and throughout.\n\n315\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.073\nKeep in mind that your bandwidth is really\nlimited when it comes to satellite.\n\n316\n00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:52.279\nAnd then we throw in some of the other\nconcepts that we've talked about when it\n\n317\n00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:53.452\ncomes to satellite.\n\n318\n00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.523\nWe talk about radio frequency\ninterference, reflective,\n\n319\n00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:58.941\nwe have refraction and\nreflection if you will.\n\n320\n00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:02.110\nYou have bounce when it comes\nto the signals themselves,\n\n321\n00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.098\ncan further slow it down even more.\n\n322\n00:16:04.098 --> 00:16:08.826\nSo Satellite might not be something that\nyou want to ensure high definition video\n\n323\n00:16:08.826 --> 00:16:10.362\nis going across, right?\n\n324\n00:16:10.362 --> 00:16:13.196\nYou might get very,\nvery poor performance out of that.\n\n325\n00:16:13.196 --> 00:16:14.601\nData files could be great, right?\n\n326\n00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:16.764\nIt's not a time sensitive\ntype communication.\n\n327\n00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:17.507\nI'm okay with that.\n\n328\n00:16:17.507 --> 00:16:19.460\nIt might take a little bit longer, right?\n\n329\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.280\nBut if I wanna have a high definition\nconference system and Dan and\n\n330\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.290\nI wanna communicate, it's probably gonna\nbe better that happens over an ISP that's\n\n331\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.480\nusing fiber versus one that's\nusing satellite communications.\n\n332\n00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.520\nAll right, so that's one of the very\nfirst ones that we talk about.\n\n333\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.570\nThe other one's,\ncellular communications, right?\n\n334\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.482\nYou're probably familiar, it's It's a rare\nday and age that we live in today that\n\n335\n00:16:39.482 --> 00:16:43.707\nmost people don't have some type\nof cellular communication, right?\n\n336\n00:16:43.707 --> 00:16:45.206\nVery, very prevalent, and\n\n337\n00:16:45.206 --> 00:16:48.460\nI want you to know some of\nthe technologies that you could see.\n\n338\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.215\nNow in the net Plus please\nunderstand ladies and gentlemen,\n\n339\n00:16:51.215 --> 00:16:54.585\nwe go way more in depth in\nthe specifics of these technologies but\n\n340\n00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:58.755\nthere are some cellular communications\nthat we want you to know about there.\n\n341\n00:16:58.755 --> 00:17:01.530\nTwo of the main ones\nthat have been around for\n\n342\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:06.114\na very long time are CDMA Code divisional\nmultiple access as well as GSM.\n\n343\n00:17:06.114 --> 00:17:08.652\nGSM is Global Systems for Mobiles.\n\n344\n00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:11.940\nWe talk about Global System Mobiles.\n\n345\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.453\nAgain, this is a one where it's\neasier to swap your phones.\n\n346\n00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:17.557\nAnd why is that?\n\n347\n00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:18.997\nWell, if you look at GSM,\n\n348\n00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:25.820\nGSM is one of the cellular communication\ntypes that uses the little SIM Chip right?\n\n349\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.713\nAnd that sim chip, kind of, looks like a\nlittle SD card, and I can pop the sim out,\n\n350\n00:17:29.713 --> 00:17:33.268\nI can buy me another phone and then pop\nthe sim in that new card and it switches\n\n351\n00:17:33.268 --> 00:17:36.969\nthe carrier that's all, okay all your\ninformation is in that card anyways.\n\n352\n00:17:36.969 --> 00:17:41.750\nNow, I see the phone and relative to\nthe device information and your account,\n\n353\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.717\nwe can go and use that phone now.\n\n354\n00:17:43.717 --> 00:17:46.452\nCDMA, The Code Division Multiple Access\nlittle bit different right?\n\n355\n00:17:46.452 --> 00:17:48.508\nThis is one where you get a phone lock And\n\n356\n00:17:48.508 --> 00:17:52.320\nI don't mean the phone lock as in like\na pin number that you have to put in.\n\n357\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.910\nI mean the phones are typically only gonna\ngo through that carrier like you turn and\n\n358\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.850\nburn phones that we have, the one's that\nyou buy you pay a monthly price, and\n\n359\n00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.010\nthen when you're done you\nkinda throw in the garbage.\n\n360\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.650\nThis could be sims as well but\n\n361\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.670\nagain with CDMA you do get carrier\nlock because the phones themselves.\n\n362\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.610\nTypically, will not be able to\nbe transferred between carriers.\n\n363\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.724\nCouple more that we're\ngonna talk about as well.\n\n364\n00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:18.793\nWhen we talk about our LAN types,\nWiMAX is another one.\n\n365\n00:18:18.793 --> 00:18:23.035\nWiMAX has kinda gone by the wayside today,\nbecause of LTE.\n\n366\n00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.899\nLT is the long term evolution.\n\n367\n00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:26.019\nYou've probably heard of it.\n\n368\n00:18:26.019 --> 00:18:27.820\nThis is the 4G technology.\n\n369\n00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.320\nYMax was a very early on 4G technology.\n\n370\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:41.840\nThe Body that oversees,\nit's called the 3GPP.\n\n371\n00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.012\nAnd it, they said okay,\nyou can call Y back so 4G technology but\n\n372\n00:18:46.012 --> 00:18:50.901\nit's a metropolitan area based network and\nit provides a high bandwidth.\n\n373\n00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:55.293\nThink of it as like a WiFi for\nan entire city if you will, right?\n\n374\n00:18:55.293 --> 00:18:57.675\nIt's a wireless interoperability for\nmicrowave access.\n\n375\n00:18:57.675 --> 00:18:58.453\n&gt;&gt; That's actually really cool.\n\n376\n00:18:58.453 --> 00:18:59.757\n&gt;&gt; It is, right?\n\n377\n00:18:59.757 --> 00:19:01.620\nIt's gotta a pretty decent bandwidth.\n\n378\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.050\nIt's got like 30 mega bit transfer speed.\n\n379\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.830\nSo I mean it's not really a slow, I do\nwant you to know an IEEE number on this.\n\n380\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.350\nWen we talk about things like ethernet And\nWi-Fi, right,\n\n381\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.810\nwe've mentioned ethernet as\nan 802.3 standard, Wi-Fi's 802.11.\n\n382\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.828\nI want you to know 802.16, I don't know if\nthey're gonna ask you that on the exam but\n\n383\n00:19:18.828 --> 00:19:22.080\ntechnically that's the IEEE\nspecification for OUI MAC.\n\n384\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.592\nSo again, it's a metropolitan area\nbased network which is a network type\n\n385\n00:19:25.592 --> 00:19:28.200\nwe're gonna talk about at\nthe end of this episode.\n\n386\n00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.240\nSome of the other ones\nthat we can talk about,\n\n387\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.650\nwe talked about 3G,\nthat's a generic term, 4G.\n\n388\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:34.758\nThat's a generic term.\n\n389\n00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:40.920\nThe most dominant 4G technology today is\ncalled Long Term Evolution and that's LTE.\n\n390\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.126\nSo you don't have to\nknow the specifics and\n\n391\n00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:45.830\nthe individual bandwidths\nI would say in the a plus.\n\n392\n00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.615\nBut know some of your\ndifferent communication types.\n\n393\n00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:50.077\nThey might ask you on the exam, and\n\n394\n00:19:50.077 --> 00:19:52.308\nwe don't know exactly what's\ngonna be on the exam.\n\n395\n00:19:52.308 --> 00:19:55.211\nWe definitely have of list of objectives\nand we try to make you as prepared as\n\n396\n00:19:55.211 --> 00:19:58.250\npossible for that exam, so\nyou knock it out of the ball park.\n\n397\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.350\nThey might ask you, they might say,\nwhich of this is a cellular communication?\n\n398\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.120\nThey might put ISTN in there, right?\n\n399\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.890\nThey might put cable in there and\n\n400\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.080\nthen somewhere in the list they\nmight put something like LTE.\n\n401\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.990\nSo, just be aware of what\nthe connection types are.\n\n402\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.650\nAll right.\n\n403\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.600\nAnd I'm sure I probably forgot one.\n\n404\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.170\nIt looks like we've got\nsatellite cellular.\n\n405\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.810\nAnd now, we do have to talk about,\n\n406\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.340\nSome of the concepts around cellular\ncommunications, and this is more about\n\n407\n00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.930\nconfiguration than it is modification\nof the communications itself, right?\n\n408\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:28.460\nCellular and\n\n409\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.620\nsatellite are two specifically\ndifferent types of communications.\n\n410\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.580\nWe're really talking about some of\nthe configurations you can do with\n\n411\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.720\ncellular today.\n\n412\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.120\nAnd that is what's known as Tethering and\na mobile hotspot, all right.\n\n413\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.960\nConceptually they're almost\nkind of the same, right?\n\n414\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Very close.\n\n415\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so tethering essentially\nis a way to allow multiple cellular\n\n416\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.860\ncommunications over a single device.\n\n417\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.840\nAnd a mobile hotspot is\ntechnically multiple\n\n418\n00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.020\ncellular communications\nover a single device.\n\n419\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.790\nSo What's going on here, right?\n\n420\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.510\nWell with tethering, that means I\nhave something like my cell phone,\n\n421\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.043\nas I struggle to find it\nin my pocket here [LAUGH]-\n\n422\n00:21:07.043 --> 00:21:07.549\n&gt;&gt; I stole it--\n\n423\n00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:09.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He stole it, that's right.\n\n424\n00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.180\nSo I have my cell phone and\nwhat I do here is I let Dan, Dan says hey,\n\n425\n00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.610\nI need to get a connection right now and I\nknow Dan's got cellular communication but\n\n426\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.930\nlet's say he brought in for\ninstance an iPad.\n\n427\n00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.660\nIf I had an iPhone here, or\nif I had an Android tablet.\n\n428\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.502\nI said you know what Dan, that's okay\nI know we're on the road bud and\n\n429\n00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:28.345\nlet me go ahead and open up Tethering and\nyou can connect to my phone and\n\n430\n00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:30.472\nuse my connection to get\nout there to the Internet.\n\n431\n00:21:30.472 --> 00:21:31.608\nThat's Tethering.\n\n432\n00:21:31.608 --> 00:21:34.469\nNow, with mobile hot spots,\nthis is a little bit different.\n\n433\n00:21:34.469 --> 00:21:36.503\nThis is typically some\nkind of dedicated device.\n\n434\n00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:42.080\nIn fact, I stole Dan's credit card right\nhere before the beginning of the show,\n\n435\n00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.600\nand we're gonna spend his money.\n\n436\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.870\nLet's go ahead and check this out.\n\n437\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.720\nI Brought up a little search engine here,\nGoogle.\n\n438\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.150\nA little search engine [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.500\nMassive search engine, and\nwe just typed in mobile hotspot device and\n\n440\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.240\nyou can see that there\nare these little devices.\n\n441\n00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.370\nAll different kinds guys.\n\n442\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.962\nWe're not endorsing anybody here.\n\n443\n00:21:57.962 --> 00:22:00.471\nYou can see that You can get\nsome of them at Best Buy.\n\n444\n00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:01.743\nYou can get them on Amazon.\n\n445\n00:22:01.743 --> 00:22:03.191\nThere's Netgear out there.\n\n446\n00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:04.432\nAll different kinds.\n\n447\n00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:07.648\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nwe'll take this Best Buy one and\n\n448\n00:22:07.648 --> 00:22:09.132\nkind of view what this is.\n\n449\n00:22:09.132 --> 00:22:12.161\nIt doesn't really look like much,\nit doesn't look like anything special.\n\n450\n00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:15.533\nBut what it is is it's a device that\nallows you to do something known as\n\n451\n00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:16.940\nmultiplexing Right?\n\n452\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.030\nIt's one of the things that you get in\ninternet connections when we tell you that\n\n453\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.520\nyou multiplex.\n\n454\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.440\nYou're taking more than one signal and\n\n455\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.000\nyou're sending it out\nover a single channel.\n\n456\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.300\nA single communication.\n\n457\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.930\nAnd that's essentially what\nthis allows you to do.\n\n458\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.970\nIt allows me that if I don't have a\ncellular communication, let's say Dan and\n\n459\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.950\nI both Have Android tablets or iPads and\nwe need to connect out to the internet but\n\n460\n00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.010\nwe dont want to pay the price\nmonthly if you will, for\n\n461\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.070\na single cellular communication\nacross each device.\n\n462\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.670\nWell that's ok, we can buy one of\nthese devices or the company can,\n\n463\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.946\nyou know [INAUDIBLE] TV can and they have\nin the past we have taken this to things\n\n464\n00:22:49.946 --> 00:22:55.480\nlike when they went out to the cyber,\nSecurity conferences as well.\n\n465\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.550\n&gt;&gt; RSA.\n\n466\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.756\n&gt;&gt; RSA, thank you, and what is it,\nconsumer electronics show, or\n\n467\n00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:01.911\nwhatever, CES.\n\n468\n00:23:01.911 --> 00:23:05.675\nWell, we had a bunch of devices that\nweren't phones, but they needed some kind\n\n469\n00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:09.568\nof Internet connectivity so that we could\nstream that information live, right?\n\n470\n00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:11.780\nWell, we would get one of\nthese mobile hotspots and\n\n471\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.021\nwe would allow each one of those devices\nto connect to the singular device,\n\n472\n00:23:15.021 --> 00:23:17.045\nif you will, and\nmake those communications.\n\n473\n00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:20.649\n&gt;&gt; Quick point of clarification just to\nmake sure you guys understand exactly\n\n474\n00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:23.232\nthe difference between tethering and\nhotspotting.\n\n475\n00:23:23.232 --> 00:23:26.886\nTethering is when you actually use\na USB cable to connect your phone to\n\n476\n00:23:26.886 --> 00:23:30.989\nanother device and use that phone's\nconnection to give it internet access.\n\n477\n00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:33.290\nHotspotting is when I'm using Wi-Fi or\n\n478\n00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.953\nwireless communications to do\nbasically the exact same thing.\n\n479\n00:23:36.953 --> 00:23:38.893\nThe cool thing about\nhot spotting though is,\n\n480\n00:23:38.893 --> 00:23:42.030\nI can have multiple devices a whole\nlot easier than I can with tethering.\n\n481\n00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n482\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.638\nAll right, so notice that it really\ndoesn't look much different than any other\n\n483\n00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:48.117\nconnectivity device you have.\n\n484\n00:23:48.117 --> 00:23:50.122\nSo which device should you buy?\n\n485\n00:23:50.122 --> 00:23:52.892\nReally is based on the plan and\nlook at the quality.\n\n486\n00:23:52.892 --> 00:23:56.768\nSome devices again, will say, hey,\nwe offer this kind of speed and\n\n487\n00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:59.284\nwe don't offer this kind of speed, right?\n\n488\n00:23:59.284 --> 00:24:02.596\nSo, again,\njust like everything on the internet,\n\n489\n00:24:02.596 --> 00:24:04.870\nhow much money do you have to spend.\n\n490\n00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.059\nthey also talk about line of\nsight wireless internet service.\n\n491\n00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:12.170\nThat's another completely different topic\nhere when we talk about line of sight\n\n492\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.284\nwireless service, WiMAX.\n\n493\n00:24:13.284 --> 00:24:13.810\n&gt;&gt; The WiMAX.\n\n494\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.030\n&gt;&gt; WiMAX is an example of a line\nof sight internet service.\n\n495\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.565\nCellular communications\nare an form of line of sight.\n\n496\n00:24:21.565 --> 00:24:25.485\nYou get within a cell that\na tower is producing and\n\n497\n00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:28.930\nyou've got to have some kind of\ncommunication with the tower.\n\n498\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.715\nWiMAX uses different transmitters\nas well so also keep that in mind.\n\n499\n00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:34.755\nAgain, line of sight internet service,\n\n500\n00:24:34.755 --> 00:24:38.695\nyou might hear the term LOS\nwireless internet service.\n\n501\n00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:42.470\nAnd again, it just means that whatever\nthe transmitter is I have to be\n\n502\n00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.880\nwithin the line of sight so that\nthe receiver can pick up that information.\n\n503\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880\nAll right.\n\n504\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.070\nNow one of the last things I want to\nmention are the geographical locations,\n\n505\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.090\nwe've kind of mentioned\nsome of these terms.\n\n506\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.790\nAll right.\n\n507\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.270\nThey call out a few of them.\n\n508\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.630\nI always say [LAUGH] these are the ans.\n\n509\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.390\nRight?\nWe have what's known a WAN.\n\n510\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.370\nAnd we have what's known as a LAN.\n\n511\n00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.140\nAll right.\n\n512\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.660\nA WAN is a wide area network, all right?\n\n513\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.730\nA LAN is a local area network, all right?\n\n514\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.230\nSo, I've got kind of a little diagram\nthat describes what a LAN is.\n\n515\n00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:13.490\nThe local area network essentially is\na network that's, Comprised of a single\n\n516\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.340\ngeographical location and it's under the\ncontrol of a single administrative body.\n\n517\n00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.470\nWell, what do we mean by that?\n\n518\n00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.940\nWell, it could be a business.\n\n519\n00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.250\nIt could be a residential area.\n\n520\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.860\nYour home network is considered\na local area network.\n\n521\n00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.390\nIt is typically connected with a\nrelatively high speed, short range media.\n\n522\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:35.210\nAnd it is sitting, typically, behind\nyour home router modem, if you will.\n\n523\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.800\nBut you control it.\n\n524\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.380\nYou dictate how many computers or\ndevices in there.\n\n525\n00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.410\nYou control the cabling and all that\neven if you have somebody come in and\n\n526\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.390\ndo the wiring.\n\n527\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.270\nAll right, a wide area network\nis comprised of multiple\n\n528\n00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.220\ngeographical locations, if you will,\nall connected together, right?\n\n529\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.150\nWANs Wide Area Networks are typically\nsomething that you're gonna\n\n530\n00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.170\nsee inside of a corporation or\na business, right.\n\n531\n00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.120\nWhere maybe Dan works at\nour Eastern Branch, right.\n\n532\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.200\nOur Eastern Branch might\nbe here in Gainesville.\n\n533\n00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.230\nI might say okay, Dan I'm moving to\nNew England or somewhere up in you know,\n\n534\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:14.690\nI don't know maybe in Mass,\nMassachusetts or New Hampshire there.\n\n535\n00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.180\nAnd we have a local area network up there.\n\n536\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.880\nBut over the Internet, we are connected to\nwhere if Dan needed resources within my\n\n537\n00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.010\nLAN, he can gain access to it.\n\n538\n00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.840\nIf I needed access to\nthe resources with inside his LAN,\n\n539\n00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.170\nwe could through the WAN connection.\n\n540\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.250\nReally when you look at a guys and\ngirls out there,\n\n541\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.480\nthe Internet is a nothing more than\na bunch of local area networks.\n\n542\n00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.790\nAnd they could be very big local\narea networks connected together\n\n543\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.810\nforming a wide area network.\n\n544\n00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.100\nThey call out a couple\nother ones there as well.\n\n545\n00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.900\nThey call out what is known as a MAN and\na PAN, all right?\n\n546\n00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.060\nNow while we talk about a MAN,\nwe're not talking about gender here.\n\n547\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.690\nWe're talking about\na metropolitan area-based network.\n\n548\n00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.460\nWe talked about one MAN based technology,\nmetro area\n\n549\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.260\nMetropolitan area based network,\nthat's y-match, right?\n\n550\n00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.278\nBecause what does it do.\n\n551\n00:27:04.278 --> 00:27:08.380\nMetropolitan Area Based Network, you can\nthink of it as, I used to say zip code but\n\n552\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.490\ntechnically that's not true,\n\n553\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:14.590\nthink of it as more like a city,\na city basically type connection.\n\n554\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.570\nit's a geographical location that\nisn't quite as big as a WAN.\n\n555\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.850\nCertainly much bigger than LAN itself.\n\n556\n00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.570\nAll right.\nLast one is the PAN.\n\n557\n00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.140\nThat's the Personal Area Network.\n\n558\n00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.060\nAnd the Personal Area Network is typically\njust a couple of computers, maybe,\n\n559\n00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:32.180\nyour laptop and your home computer\nif you will, maybe your cellphone.\n\n560\n00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.070\nYou could take for instance,\nI know people like the bluetooth ear buds.\n\n561\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.370\nBluetooth will allow you to form\n\n562\n00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.370\na Personal Area Network communication,\nright?\n\n563\n00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.490\nBluetooth is an example of a device or\na technology that allows you\n\n564\n00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.230\nto form a wireless personal\narea network communication.\n\n565\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.130\nIt'll be a little more specific.\n\n566\n00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.371\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou can do through tethering as well.\n\n567\n00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:49.240\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n568\n00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.402\nThat's a great point,\n\n569\n00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:54.540\ntethering in mobile hotspots almost\nwill perform the personal area network.\n\n570\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.710\nSo just some of the different kinds that\nyou have out there, there are some that\n\n571\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.940\nare additional ones that they\ndon't call out in the objectives,\n\n572\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.880\nand just for honorable mentions\nwe'll go ahead and mention on here.\n\n573\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.210\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n574\n00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.060\n&gt;&gt; CAN is another one.\n\n575\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.100\nThat's a campus area network.\n\n576\n00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.840\n&gt;&gt; That's Canadian area network.\n\n577\n00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.350\n&gt;&gt; That's Canadian area network.\n\n578\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.230\nThat's right.\n\n579\n00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.100\nCampus area network is typically under\nthe control of a single academic body.\n\n580\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.060\nWe'll give you an example here.\n\n581\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.600\nWe're in Gainesville, we have UF.\n\n582\n00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.320\nUF has buildings all over Gainesville.\n\n583\n00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.300\nAll over the Alachua County area, right?\n\n584\n00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.240\nAnd they control every one of them.\n\n585\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.740\nAnd their connections in\nbetween that building,\n\n586\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.820\nthey might very well have laid them.\n\n587\n00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.560\nNow, they can also rent them\nfrom an ISP as well, but\n\n588\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.855\nthey control that network themselves,\nright?\n\n589\n00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:38.945\nYou can have things like doctors' offices,\ninsurances companies can be considered.\n\n590\n00:28:38.945 --> 00:28:40.905\nI guess that's a little bit different.\n\n591\n00:28:40.905 --> 00:28:42.545\nIt's not academia.\n\n592\n00:28:42.545 --> 00:28:46.605\nYou know, things like Berkeley,\nif you will, where there's large buildings\n\n593\n00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:51.745\nall over the place and\nthey form a single campus area network.\n\n594\n00:28:51.745 --> 00:28:52.785\nGlobal area network?\n\n595\n00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:57.335\nI'm glad I see this one gone because it\nis very confusing when you say global\n\n596\n00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:59.660\narea network versus wide area network.\n\n597\n00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.780\nBecause that was one of those grey areas.\n\n598\n00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:07.720\nCuz technically the internet could be\ncalled a WAN and a GAN, as they call it,\n\n599\n00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.760\na global area network.\n\n600\n00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.270\nGlobal area network typically is one\nthat you have a wide area network\n\n601\n00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.990\nthat spans multiple countries, right?\n\n602\n00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:21.460\nVersus just multiple geographical\nlocations within a single country.\n\n603\n00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.920\nSo couple other ones that\nwe wanna mention there,\n\n604\n00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.180\nthank goodness that you don't\nhave to worry that in your exam.\n\n605\n00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.510\nI will say know the difference\nbetween PAN and a WPAN\n\n606\n00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:33.760\nas well,because there is a personal area\nnetwork that uses wired connections and\n\n607\n00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.940\nthere is a wireless personal\narea network connection,\n\n608\n00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:41.018\nI did mention with tethering and\nhotspots if you will, and the Bluetooth\n\n609\n00:29:41.018 --> 00:29:45.460\ncommunication around.\n\n610\n00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Escaping your mind.\n\n611\n00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.430\n&gt;&gt; And that's why you gotta\nkeep it in mind there.\n\n612\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.040\nSo, you don't wanna exam,\nthat would be bad.\n\n613\n00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.790\nSo just a couple of the different kind of\ninternet connection types that you gotta\n\n614\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.540\nbe aware of for the exam.\n\n615\n00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\nthey were definitely a multitude of them.\n\n616\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.300\nSo go back through these things to\nunderstand which connection type is what,\n\n617\n00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.830\nwhat follows under what category and\nhow they're actually working.\n\n618\n00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.290\nJust be familiar with these things, it's\nnot a super in-depth look at these topics,\n\n619\n00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.508\nbut you have to have those\nbasic familiarizations.\n\n620\n00:30:17.508 --> 00:30:19.730\nThat being said, Wes,\nit looks like we've come to the end of yet\n\n621\n00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:20.770\nanother great episode.\n\n622\n00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.630\nHopefully you feel that way and\nyou come back for\n\n623\n00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.490\nmore because we have more A+ coming.\n\n624\n00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.630\nBut, let's go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n625\n00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.370\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n626\n00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.686\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n627\n00:30:30.686 --> 00:30:31.290\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:30:31.290 -->

00:00:08.308\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.996\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:13.916\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:17.290\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.140\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.090\nwe're back with more in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.440\nSo glad to have you guys joining\nus in the studio again today.\n\n10\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.130\nAnd joining us is our good friend Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.310\nWes, glad to have you as well.\n\n12\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.030\nHow's it going, Sir?\n\n13\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.450\nWe've been moving through some of our\nnetworking concepts, and you know,\n\n15\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.040\nwe've been talking about all\ndifferent types of things, right?\n\n16\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.990\nWe've been talking about\na lot of the software side\n\n17\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.390\naspects of things like the services,\nports, protocols if you will.\n\n18\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.370\nWe've been talking about,\n\n19\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.175\nhey networks allow us to pass\ninformation between each other.\n\n20\n00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.090\nWell, we haven't really talked\nabout is the middle man,\n\n21\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.030\nthe devices that\nare actually responsible for\n\n22\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.980\npotentially making decisions on\nwhere to send the information.\n\n23\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.516\nSo we are going to be looking at, I know\nit says network architecture devices.\n\n24\n00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:05.585\nWell, we really could just take\narchitecture out of this and\n\n25\n00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:09.437\njust think about as we're gonna look at\nsome of the devices that are actually\n\n26\n00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:13.190\nhelping us to share resources and\nessentially perform communications.\n\n27\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.393\nCuz that's what network is about, right.\n\n28\n00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:20.965\nIf we think about it very basically,\nI think about in the earlier days when I\n\n29\n00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:25.753\nwanted to play a video game with a friend\nof mine, I had to get up from my couch and\n\n30\n00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:27.810\nI had to walk over to their house.\n\n31\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.240\nAnd I had to play essentially on\nthe device at their house, right?\n\n32\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.790\nAnd it certainly isn't that way today,\n\n33\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.440\nbecause now we can have communications\nbetween different locations.\n\n34\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.310\nWe wanna talk more, spend some time\nbecause there are different devices and\n\n35\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.550\nwhat device you may or may not use.\n\n36\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.350\nMaybe you choose one,\nis really gonna be contingent on\n\n37\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.830\nwhat type of communication and\nreally what functionality do you need.\n\n38\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.940\nSo let's go ahead, that's what we're\ngonna talk about in this episode and\n\n39\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.430\nlet's go ahead and talk about one that's\nbeen around for a very long time, but\n\n40\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.070\nwe're starting to see less and less of it,\nat least from a networking perspective.\n\n41\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.250\nAnd that is what is known\nas the good old hub.\n\n42\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.350\nAll right, now hubs have been around for\na long time and\n\n43\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.300\nI want you to understand that when\nI say that we're seeing less and\n\n44\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.080\nless of them in networking you might\nsay well I got six of them over here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.670\nIf you've been around the industry for\na little bit or know about computers,\n\n46\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.130\nI'm not necessarily talking about USB\nbased hubs or FireWire based hubs.\n\n47\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.510\nWe'll mention those in context.\n\n48\n00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.005\nBut I'm talking about\nthe earlier days of networking.\n\n49\n00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:32.545\nIf you need a communication, what you\nwould do is you would take a cable,\n\n50\n00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:35.745\na network cable, and you'd plug it\ninto this device known as a hub.\n\n51\n00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:38.705\nAll right, so I've got kind of\nan example of a hub right here.\n\n52\n00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:40.575\nAnd again, just a real basic diagram.\n\n53\n00:02:40.575 --> 00:02:44.535\nBut what we wanna understand about a hub\nis that a hub doesn't really have any\n\n54\n00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:45.205\nlogic in it.\n\n55\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:47.085\nIt doesn't really make any decisions.\n\n56\n00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:50.160\nSo when we talk about potentially pass and\n\n57\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.860\nmaking the decision on where\nto send the information.\n\n58\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.780\nThe hub doesn't do that.\n\n59\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.885\nBelieve it or not a hub is hardwired to\nreceive an electrical communication and\n\n60\n00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:05.400\nre-send it if you will, out all of\nthe connections that are made to it.\n\n61\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.630\nLet's talk real briefly\nabout a connection.\n\n62\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.850\nAll right, because we've been talking,\n\n63\n00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.290\nwe've talked in the past\nepisodes about a port, right?\n\n64\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.070\nAnd what we mean by a port there is really\na logical identifier that's inside of\n\n65\n00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.570\nsoftware that you're operating system\nuses to identify the service that it's\n\n66\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.490\nusing, right?\n\n67\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.340\nFor instance, FTP,\nwe're gonna be using things like port 20.\n\n68\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.670\nWe're talking Telnet.\n\n69\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.520\nWe're identifying that services\nrunning on port 23, right.\n\n70\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.770\nIt is the way software recognizes\nthis is the service I'm using.\n\n71\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.850\nWhen we talk about a port inside of\na connectivity device, we're talking about\n\n72\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.300\na lot of the same concept when we look\nat the motherboard and our chassis.\n\n73\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.730\nThis electrical connection that you make\nby plugging some kind of fiber optic or\n\n74\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.250\ncopper based media plugging it\ninto a opening on the device.\n\n75\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.610\n&gt;&gt; So an actual physical\nport versus a software port.\n\n76\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.150\n&gt;&gt; Most of it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n77\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.960\nwe gotta get the two correct, right?\n\n78\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, and\nit's a physical connection, right?\n\n79\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.530\nYou might hear it called\nan interface guys, gals.\n\n80\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.210\nDon't let that confuse you.\n\n81\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.320\nAny type of interface is\na point of interaction.\n\n82\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.840\nRight, that's really what an interface is.\n\n83\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.110\nYou have software interfaces which says\nhey, this program, talks to this program.\n\n84\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.500\nIt's that, if you will,\nthat communication point.\n\n85\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.220\nWhen we talk about a physical interface,\nwe're talking about that interaction\n\n86\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.790\npoint between the copper or the optical\ncable plugging into the device itself.\n\n87\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.380\n&gt;&gt; To the extra connection\npoint at that point.\n\n88\n00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.290\n&gt;&gt; The connection point,\n\n89\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.549\nyeah, that's right, and,\nthey have different shapes and sizes.\n\n90\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.356\nNow, when we talk about a hub I said that\nit doesn't make any decisions on where\n\n91\n00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.882\nto send information because\nit really is hardwired.\n\n92\n00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:39.045\nIt's through electrical circuitry\nwith very little if any really,\n\n93\n00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.520\nsoftware on the device.\n\n94\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.670\nSo, this has it's benefit and\nthe fact that they're relatively cheap and\n\n95\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.560\nby days means of standards they are very,\nvery cheap.\n\n96\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.480\nBut it also has a drawback, all right.\n\n97\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.535\nAnd that means when we use hubs and\nnetworking,\n\n98\n00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:56.820\nif this computer sends information to\nthis computer, the hub doesn't make any\n\n99\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.980\ndecision that hey I shouldn't send this\ninformation to this computer, right?\n\n100\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.680\nWhat happens is electrical\ncommunication goes into the hub and\n\n101\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.360\nthen what the hub does is it turns around\nand through its wires that are physically\n\n102\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.700\nsoldered into the motherboard and\nthe trace is on the PCB as it\n\n103\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.620\nIt reboosts the signal and\njust sends it out on all ports.\n\n104\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.160\nNow, I want you to think about that.\n\n105\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.670\nIf I need a communication that this needs\nto happen between me and Dan, or Dan and\n\n106\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.510\nI, excuse me, I was trying\na little better English there.\n\n107\n00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.080\nAll right, between Dan and I, there's no\nreason for me to walk out the door and\n\n108\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.510\ntell every one of our producers that are\nsitting in our command center helping us\n\n109\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.640\nmake, just basically,\nproduce our episodes, right?\n\n110\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.170\nIt's a lot of waste of communication, and\n\n111\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.780\nit's certainly not talking down to them,\nbut\n\n112\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.410\nthey've got better things to be doing and\nbusy things that they're concentrating on.\n\n113\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.210\nSo, it creates this contention, right?\n\n114\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.470\nIt creates this contention in the fact\nthat were actually disturbing\n\n115\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.910\nthe other people within that conversation\nbecause they don't really need to hear it.\n\n116\n00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.630\nI also want you think about the fact\nthat it is basically adding\n\n117\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.310\nmore information on a network\nthat really needs to be.\n\n118\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.090\nAnd that's one of the reasons that we\ndon't really use them too much inside of\n\n119\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.340\na networking communication technologies\ntoday because, they put unnecessary\n\n120\n00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.120\ncommunications across the network,\ncreates contention, creates congestion.\n\n121\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.890\nAll right,\nwhen we say congestion, imagine,\n\n122\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.030\nI don't need more electrical signals\nif I only need sent to one computer.\n\n123\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.450\nSo I want you to remember\nthat about the hub.\n\n124\n00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.210\nNow that being said, I don't want you to\nalso to think that we don't use hubs.\n\n125\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.030\nBecause we've talked about the theory\nbehind things like the universal\n\n126\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.510\nserial bus, we've talked about FireWire,\nwe've talked about things like\n\n127\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.270\nThunderbolt in which you can daisy\nchain up to six devices, primarily for\n\n128\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.310\nhigh definition video and sound today.\n\n129\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.730\nThose are hubs as well.\n\n130\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.310\nThat essentially is two devices that\nare connected and they're communicating.\n\n131\n00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.000\nSo, technically,\nthat's a network, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.440\nSo again, let me just be very careful\nin how I say that we don't use hubs,\n\n133\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.730\ncuz I'd hate for you guys to get into\nthe industries and say, I see an HDMI hub,\n\n134\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.960\na Thunderbolt hub, a USB hub, and\nsay, what is Wes talking about?\n\n135\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.900\nBut I mean, quite literally, for\na network communications and\n\n136\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.060\nthings like your communication closets,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.319\nWe're seeing less and less of these hubs,\nif any, today at all.\n\n138\n00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:05.731\n&gt;&gt; Right, and even if you can't have, you\ncan grab that USB hub, and you can plug\n\n139\n00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:11.220\nin USB 3 network dongles, that have\nRJ-45 connectors built into them.\n\n140\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.030\nPlug into that.\n\n141\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.840\nThat is not a networking hub,\neven though it is doing the same job.\n\n142\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.080\nWhat we're talking about here is\na networking hub properly, right?\n\n143\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.050\nIts job is to connect computers\nthrough Ethernet standards or\n\n144\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.020\nmaybe something else.\n\n145\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.900\nBut for networking standards,\nnot necessarily USB per se.\n\n146\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.490\nAll right, so just keep that in mind.\n\n147\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, because there's some\ntranslation that has to go between those\n\n148\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.070\nsimilar protocols, so\nit is slightly different.\n\n149\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.380\nNow, as technology progressed,\nthey do find that it became more efficient\n\n150\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.530\nto have a device that would actually have\na little bit of logic built in to it and\n\n151\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.020\ncan start to make decisions\non where to send information.\n\n152\n00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.738\nAll right, and what we mean by that\nis a device known as a switch.\n\n153\n00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:53.283\nAnd we do use these pretty heavily\nin just about every internal\n\n154\n00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:56.979\nlocal area network and\neven on the backbone of the Internet too.\n\n155\n00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:00.096\nAnd we'll talk about some of the\ndifferences between some of the devices\n\n156\n00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:02.050\nas well as we continue\nthrough this episode.\n\n157\n00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.369\nNow the next device when\nwe talk about a switch.\n\n158\n00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:05.421\nLet's go ahead and\n\n159\n00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.574\nI've gotta a little simplistic diagram\nhere of a diagram here of a switch.\n\n160\n00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:14.206\nNow, switch just looks like, in this case,\nit's got more connections than a hub so\n\n161\n00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:15.920\nwhat is the difference?\n\n162\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.933\nWell, a switch does make a logical\ndecision on where to send the information.\n\n163\n00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:24.173\nNow a switch does something kinda\ninteresting because just like a hub,\n\n164\n00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:28.061\nwe have a physical connection that is made\nthrough a copper-based cable, or it could\n\n165\n00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:32.452\nbe optical light source depending on how\nexpensive it is and they get expensive.\n\n166\n00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:35.887\nAll right, notice that the connections\naren't going to be looking pretty much in\n\n167\n00:08:35.887 --> 00:08:37.401\nthe diagram no different, right?\n\n168\n00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:38.931\nSo what is the difference?\n\n169\n00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:42.128\nWell internally in that device\nin a switch it actually looks,\n\n170\n00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:45.202\nit starts to look at addressing\ninformation all right, and\n\n171\n00:08:45.202 --> 00:08:48.105\nremember why we talked about\naddressing information.\n\n172\n00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:48.819\nWhat do we use it for?\n\n173\n00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:54.259\nWell, just like source, excuse me, mailing\naddress, and the return mailing address.\n\n174\n00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:58.632\nYou're postal carriers use it to say, hey,\nI know where this information's going to.\n\n175\n00:08:58.632 --> 00:09:02.179\nAnd really more importantly inside of\ncommunications a lot of times we focus on\n\n176\n00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:03.370\nwhat the destination is.\n\n177\n00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.990\nSo if I'm communicating\nI know where it goes.\n\n178\n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.844\nWell it's interesting because a switch has\ninside of it, has this little database,\n\n179\n00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:10.390\nall right?\n\n180\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.306\nA little database that is\nmade up of the devices that\n\n181\n00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:18.790\nare connected to its ports and\ntheir physical addresses.\n\n182\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.150\nAnd its something I want you to know.\n\n183\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.953\nA switch operates on what's\nknown as a MAC address.\n\n184\n00:09:23.953 --> 00:09:27.094\nNow when we talked about some\nof our TCP/IP characteristics,\n\n185\n00:09:27.094 --> 00:09:30.234\none of the things that we mentioned\nin that series of episodes,\n\n186\n00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:34.770\nwe have multiple parts in there, we talked\nabout the media access control address.\n\n187\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.840\nThe MAC address,\nthat 48 bit 6 byte identifier,\n\n188\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.300\nuniquely identifies the network\nadapter that is in the PC.\n\n189\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.562\nWell, your switches, understand,\nhave PCs that are connected to them.\n\n190\n00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:52.572\nNow guys,\nlet me be very careful when I say PC,\n\n191\n00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:55.780\nI'm not excluding Mac.\n\n192\n00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.662\nAgain, I'm also talking Linux, Nix base\nsystems, any operating system that is\n\n193\n00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:05.120\na network-based operating system which\nprimarily all of them are today,\n\n194\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.842\nall right?\n\n195\n00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:08.747\nIs going to have if they\nconnect to a network,\n\n196\n00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:11.660\nthey're gonna have a MAC\naddress all right.\n\n197\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.770\nSo if you have a device that is connected\nthrough a physical cable to a switch,\n\n198\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.880\nthen it is going to make a decision when\nit receives the information that comes\n\n199\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.130\nin one of it's ports it's going\nto reference this listing.\n\n200\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.670\nIt's called a MAC table,\nif you will, guys.\n\n201\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.310\nBut it's gonna recognize that hey,\nI see on port two,\n\n202\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.420\nI see that computer two actually\nhas this MAC address, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.425\nAnd I see that on port 2,\nif you will, Client01, and\n\n204\n00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:39.822\nlet me make sure I get that right.\n\n205\n00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:46.358\nClient01 has this MAC address and\nit needs to send information to Client05.\n\n206\n00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:49.539\nAll right, well let me go ahead and\nlook at my table and\n\n207\n00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:53.852\nI'll figure out that client05 has\na MAC address that is connected to,\n\n208\n00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:57.548\nI'm gonna just say switch here back and\nforth here port 15.\n\n209\n00:10:57.548 --> 00:11:01.759\nSo, it make a decision,\nit says okay, I see the information,\n\n210\n00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:04.703\nI recognize that addressing information.\n\n211\n00:11:04.703 --> 00:11:09.152\nAnd I'll make a decision that says I'm\ngoing to forward that right over to\n\n212\n00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:10.960\nclient05.\n\n213\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.467\nNow unlike the hub, we don't have\na lot of ways to communications and\n\n214\n00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:17.795\nthe fact that I don't have to\nworry about client02, 03, and\n\n215\n00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:21.511\n04 receiving this information because\nit doesn't go directly to it.\n\n216\n00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:25.645\nWhat it does, is essentially it connects\na series of ports together internally and\n\n217\n00:11:25.645 --> 00:11:27.601\nit forwards it right to that computer.\n\n218\n00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:31.810\nNow, as you'll go on and learn in network\nplus and then certainly when you get into\n\n219\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.921\nCISCO you'll learn a lot more in depth and\ndetail about these\n\n220\n00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:38.990\ncouple of functionalities that I wanna\ntell you about that switches do.\n\n221\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.960\nThey primarily do three\ntypes of operations.\n\n222\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.600\nThey do what is known as forwarding and\nthat's connecting that series of ports.\n\n223\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.910\nI receive that information, I look,\nthere's a MAC address in it, right?\n\n224\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.660\nAnd it tells me that it's connected\nto port in this case maybe port 15,\n\n225\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.120\nwe're gonna send it from client 101's\nMAC Address to port 15 to the MAC Address\n\n226\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.410\ndestined in the Information, all right?\n\n227\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.694\nNow, that being said, it also does\na couple of other things, all right?\n\n228\n00:12:03.694 --> 00:12:06.006\nIf there is a broadcast communication, so\n\n229\n00:12:06.006 --> 00:12:08.842\nwhat do I mean when I say\nbroadcast communication?\n\n230\n00:12:08.842 --> 00:12:10.670\nYou have three different types\nof communications on your\n\n231\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.760\nnetworks, all right?\n\n232\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.770\nI have a communication that I say,\nyou know what?\n\n233\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.221\nI need to stand up in the room and I need\nto make everybody aware of this, right?\n\n234\n00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:21.740\nThat is called one to all communication\nit's a broadcast communication.\n\n235\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.648\nNow if we go back to the diagram\nreal quick on the switch here,\n\n236\n00:12:24.648 --> 00:12:28.357\ninterestingly enough is that when\nclient01, let's say for the analogy,\n\n237\n00:12:28.357 --> 00:12:31.572\nlet's say client01 had to stand\nup in a room and tell everybody.\n\n238\n00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:33.780\nI have something to say to everybody.\n\n239\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.220\nBroadcast communication.\n\n240\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.280\nWell, there's no reason for the switch\nto turn around and send that information\n\n241\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.802\nright back out the same port that\nit received that communication.\n\n242\n00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.312\nThat's called filtering.\n\n243\n00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:44.361\nAll right, so switch also filters.\n\n244\n00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:48.365\nIf it realizes that the source\nMAC address says all right, hey,\n\n245\n00:12:48.365 --> 00:12:53.558\nI've got communications I need to send out\nthere across the network to everybody,\n\n246\n00:12:53.558 --> 00:12:59.430\nthe switch is smart enough to know well,\nyou're the one that sent the information.\n\n247\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.780\nI don't need to send it back to you.\n\n248\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.302\nSo it filters that.\n\n249\n00:13:02.302 --> 00:13:04.610\nSo we have forwarding.\n\n250\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.200\nWe have filtering.\n\n251\n00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.495\nNow, on occasion something that can happen\nis that the switch can turn around and\n\n252\n00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:12.810\nkinda act like a hub.\n\n253\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.750\nRemember we said with a hub,\nthe hub when it receives a communication,\n\n254\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.550\nit sends it out all ports, all right?\n\n255\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.221\nWell guess what?\n\n256\n00:13:19.221 --> 00:13:20.460\nThat's called flooding.\n\n257\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.940\nAnd that's one of the problems\nwith the hubs is that they would\n\n258\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.530\nflood your network with\nunnecessary communications.\n\n259\n00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.407\nWell it's kinda interesting\nbecause what switches will do,\n\n260\n00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:31.242\nthey will actually learn, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:31.242 --> 00:13:31.883\nThey're intelligent.\n\n262\n00:13:31.883 --> 00:13:35.353\nThey'll learn about the devices that\nare connected to their ports, all right?\n\n263\n00:13:35.353 --> 00:13:41.002\nBut let's say for whatever reason, you\nplugged a computer into port 16 all right.\n\n264\n00:13:41.002 --> 00:13:42.982\nAnd we'll just say port 16 here,\n\n265\n00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:47.154\nand it's not aware that there's\na computer connected to that port right.\n\n266\n00:13:47.154 --> 00:13:50.951\nNow that doesn't happen much today because\nwhen a computers operating system comes\n\n267\n00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.372\nonline, the first thing it does is it\nsends a little bit of information out to\n\n268\n00:13:54.372 --> 00:13:56.902\nthe switch and the switch says okay,\nI see you there.\n\n269\n00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:59.047\nThis is how I'm configured and\nI'll go ahead and\n\n270\n00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:02.200\nI'll put your listing right there so\nI know where you are.\n\n271\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.990\nLet's say that doesn't happen.\n\n272\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.408\nHow does it know how to contact\nthat computer on port 16?\n\n273\n00:14:08.408 --> 00:14:13.340\nWell, let's say again, with the analogy\nclient01 has to communicate on port 2, and\n\n274\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.104\nit's gonna communicate\nto this random mystery,\n\n275\n00:14:16.104 --> 00:14:18.990\naliens, type port computer\nthat's on port 16.\n\n276\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.053\nThe switch will say, you know what?\n\n277\n00:14:22.053 --> 00:14:24.320\nI think you know who you're talking about.\n\n278\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.750\nI have no clue.\n\n279\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.023\nI'm lost on this, so here's what I'll do.\n\n280\n00:14:28.023 --> 00:14:32.736\nI'm gonna go out and I'm gonna send a\ncommunication out every single port on me,\n\n281\n00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:37.238\nin the hopes that when I do that,\na computer that's on port 16 is gonna say,\n\n282\n00:14:37.238 --> 00:14:38.653\nyeah, I'm over here.\n\n283\n00:14:38.653 --> 00:14:42.655\nAnd then the switch becomes aware of it,\nand it says, okay, let me go ahead and\n\n284\n00:14:42.655 --> 00:14:44.003\nmark that in my database.\n\n285\n00:14:44.003 --> 00:14:45.260\nThat's called flooding.\n\n286\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.540\nSo forwarding, filtering and\n\n287\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.350\nflooding are the three functionalities\nthat the switch will do.\n\n288\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.949\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n289\n00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:55.153\nI don't know of the A+ Exam actually\ngoes into this level of depth on this.\n\n290\n00:14:55.153 --> 00:14:58.430\nBut they do this for one specific reason,\nit's called collisions.\n\n291\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:03.050\nCollisions are a very Important thing when\nit comes to having a local area network.\n\n292\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.468\nOn that hub, you have what's\ncalled one giant collision domain,\n\n293\n00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:09.716\nwhich basically allows two\ncomputers to bang into each other.\n\n294\n00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:13.850\nWe're both trying to access the network\nat the same time causing a collision.\n\n295\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.632\nWell, hub is not like can do it\nbecause it can't make a decision.\n\n296\n00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:19.920\nYou jump over to a switch and\nit breaks up collision domains.\n\n297\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.340\nIt creates multiple collision domains and\n\n298\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.032\nyou think okay,\nwhat is a collision domain?\n\n299\n00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:29.722\nIf I'm able to collide with another user\nor another device on the network, and\n\n300\n00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:34.552\nwe are both having contention over having\naccess to the network at the same time,\n\n301\n00:15:34.552 --> 00:15:38.123\nthen we're considered to be\nin the same collision domain.\n\n302\n00:15:38.123 --> 00:15:41.789\nIf I remove that possibility by\nonly allowing one device on that\n\n303\n00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:44.080\ncollision domain, well there you go.\n\n304\n00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.548\nSo switches break up collision domains and\nmake multiple collision domains.\n\n305\n00:15:47.548 --> 00:15:51.418\nSo when I plug in a computer, or a host,\nor a printer or whatever into a port,\n\n306\n00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.244\nit's on its own collision domain.\n\n307\n00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:58.481\nNothing is going to try\nto Fight with it for\n\n308\n00:15:58.481 --> 00:16:02.380\naccess to that specific port.\n\n309\n00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.932\nIt is dedicated to that device.\n\n310\n00:16:04.932 --> 00:16:06.175\nSo, it's a really good job of doing that.\n\n311\n00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:10.469\nAnd every now and then,\nwe have to go through these flooding and,\n\n312\n00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.136\nnot blocking, but filtering, right?\n\n313\n00:16:13.136 --> 00:16:16.577\nThe flooding and filtering, and\nall the other great stuff, for\n\n314\n00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:18.245\nit to figure out who's where.\n\n315\n00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:19.532\nAnd make those logical decisions.\n\n316\n00:16:19.532 --> 00:16:23.790\nThat's why switches are very,\nvery popular inside of our networks today.\n\n317\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan, absolutely cuz when we look\nat our copper-based media, and again,\n\n318\n00:16:27.932 --> 00:16:31.294\nas you move into Network+,\nyou'll learn more about Ethernet and\n\n319\n00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:35.441\nthe 802.3 standard\n&gt;&gt; That it is a contention based media\n\n320\n00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:35.969\naccess.\n\n321\n00:16:35.969 --> 00:16:39.820\nAnd the reason we have contention based,\nthat competition that he's talking about,\n\n322\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.210\nis because the logic and the expense\nbehind the devices is greatly reduced.\n\n323\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.507\nIf we had people just compete rather than\nhaving to have a connectivity device that\n\n324\n00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.573\nkeeps all contention from happening.\n\n325\n00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:51.515\nSo great point there.\n\n326\n00:16:51.515 --> 00:16:56.840\nNow we talked about switches identifying,\nif you will, Mac addresses.\n\n327\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.328\n&gt;&gt; Now we talked about another type of\naddress as well, a software based address.\n\n328\n00:17:00.328 --> 00:17:04.782\nAnd that is really where something\nknown as a router comes in.\n\n329\n00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:06.439\nSo I've got a little diagram if you will,\nof a router here.\n\n330\n00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:10.147\nAnd when we look at routers, all right?\n\n331\n00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:11.463\nWhat are routers responsible for?\n\n332\n00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:14.080\nWell routers are a little\nbit different than switches.\n\n333\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.805\nSwitches are aware of the devices that\nare directly connected to its ports.\n\n334\n00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:23.646\nA router really is one of the smartest\nif not the smartest connectivity device\n\n335\n00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:24.550\nthat we have.\n\n336\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.144\nYou can kind of think of\nthe hub as completely dumb.\n\n337\n00:17:27.144 --> 00:17:29.462\nIt has no logic in it, right?\n\n338\n00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:32.146\nI can think of a Spock reference here.\n\n339\n00:17:32.146 --> 00:17:33.549\nIt's illogical, captain.\n\n340\n00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:36.409\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The switch, a moderate amount,\n\n341\n00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:39.410\nand even that's hard to say,\ncuz they're really intelligent as well.\n\n342\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.354\nBut they're only aware of the devices\nthat are physically plugged into them.\n\n343\n00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:43.596\nA router?\n\n344\n00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:44.747\nA router is aware and\n\n345\n00:17:44.747 --> 00:17:48.800\ncan be made aware of networks that\nit isn't directly connected to.\n\n346\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.248\nAnd they're really the workhorses\nof the backbone of the Internet.\n\n347\n00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:54.176\nThey're responsible for\ngetting information.\n\n348\n00:17:54.176 --> 00:17:56.787\nBecause essentially what the Internet\nis it's a bunch of small networks or\n\n349\n00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:57.580\neven large networks.\n\n350\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.207\nBut it's a bunch of\nnetworks all holding hands.\n\n351\n00:17:59.207 --> 00:18:03.046\nAnd what's interesting is that a router\nthat is on the other side of the planet,\n\n352\n00:18:03.046 --> 00:18:05.600\nand it doesn't matter\nwhat you're viewing from.\n\n353\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.257\nJust from back here in the US,\nif you're in another country, or\n\n354\n00:18:09.257 --> 00:18:13.185\nlikewise is that our computer doesn't\nhave to be directly connected\n\n355\n00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:16.661\nto that network if I can send\nthat information to the router.\n\n356\n00:18:16.661 --> 00:18:19.347\nAnd it can make that decision on\nwhere to send the information.\n\n357\n00:18:19.347 --> 00:18:22.123\nNow, a router doesn't\njust forward information.\n\n358\n00:18:22.123 --> 00:18:27.429\nIt can actually make a decision on\nthe best way to send that information.\n\n359\n00:18:27.429 --> 00:18:28.239\nNo, you know what?\n\n360\n00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:31.153\nI see that this path is going\nover a slow connection, but\n\n361\n00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.210\nthis path well, that path's rocket.\n\n362\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.081\nThat's going over fiber\noptic communication.\n\n363\n00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.198\nIt has a lot of speed behind itself.\n\n364\n00:18:38.198 --> 00:18:40.442\nThat's probably the better way to send it.\n\n365\n00:18:40.442 --> 00:18:42.089\nSo, routers are very very intelligent.\n\n366\n00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:45.843\nSo how do they make decisions on\nwhere to send the information?\n\n367\n00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:48.903\nWell, they make decisions\nthrough IP addresses.\n\n368\n00:18:48.903 --> 00:18:52.580\nAnd those IP addresses If you will, like\na MAC address is stored at a MAC table,\n\n369\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.202\na little database, well, believe it or\nnot, when we talk about our router,\n\n370\n00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:59.382\na router can actually store it's\nIP information in what's known as\n\n371\n00:18:59.382 --> 00:19:00.500\na routing table.\n\n372\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.298\nIt's a really akin,\na lot like the MAC table, all right?\n\n373\n00:19:05.298 --> 00:19:08.924\nWell, Inside of that routing table\nhas the paths to the networks\n\n374\n00:19:08.924 --> 00:19:12.830\nthat the router can learn about by\ntalking to other routers, right?\n\n375\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.232\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n376\n00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:19.956\nA router essentially allows you to\ncommunicate off of your network to another\n\n377\n00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:20.620\nnetwork.\n\n378\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.999\nThat's why we say default gateway is you\nmight hear them called gateway devices.\n\n379\n00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:28.357\nBe careful cuz a default gateway is\na specific component within TCIP that\n\n380\n00:19:28.357 --> 00:19:31.320\nis a logical identifier of the router.\n\n381\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.546\nOkay, it's where we send our information.\n\n382\n00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:38.021\nBut it is that router that does\nthe sending to another network.\n\n383\n00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:39.701\n&gt;&gt; And it is that specific router.\n\n384\n00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:43.252\nLike when you're trying to get\nfrom one network to another one,\n\n385\n00:19:43.252 --> 00:19:45.020\nto a different network.\n\n386\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.308\nThat is your gateway, right?\n\n387\n00:19:46.308 --> 00:19:50.142\nCuz you might have multiple routers\nInside of your local area network.\n\n388\n00:19:50.142 --> 00:19:51.751\nIt might be routed between VLANs.\n\n389\n00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:53.027\nAll this stuff can get complicated.\n\n390\n00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:56.333\nThe router that allows you to get to\na network that might not be yours,\n\n391\n00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:57.933\nthat's probably your gateway.\n\n392\n00:19:57.933 --> 00:19:58.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely, yeah.\n\n393\n00:19:58.925 --> 00:20:02.992\nAnd again, you can think of routers\nthemselves as allowing you to connect\n\n394\n00:20:02.992 --> 00:20:07.200\nessentially to a network that it doesn't\nhave to be directly connected to.\n\n395\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.522\nSo It's a great thing to have.\n\n396\n00:20:09.522 --> 00:20:12.585\nAnd remember, it operates on IP addresses.\n\n397\n00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:14.900\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat is a little bit about your routers.\n\n398\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.744\n&gt;&gt; Now the next one in our list is\nsomething known as an access point.\n\n399\n00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:21.301\nYou might here these abbreviated as ap.\n\n400\n00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:23.214\nI want you know that an access point,\n\n401\n00:20:23.214 --> 00:20:26.170\nthey are very generic when\nthey say access point.\n\n402\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.108\nA lot of times what we're talking about\nis a wireless access point, all right?\n\n403\n00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:33.597\nA little more specific on that, cuz an\naccess point could be considered anything\n\n404\n00:20:33.597 --> 00:20:36.950\non the network that allows you access to\nit, and that could be a wired device.\n\n405\n00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.122\nSo what I mean by that is you could\nhave a device that is controlled by\n\n406\n00:20:40.122 --> 00:20:41.491\na switch that you plug in to.\n\n407\n00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:44.449\nEssentially a hub could be called\nan access point cuz it connects into\n\n408\n00:20:44.449 --> 00:20:45.010\nthe switch.\n\n409\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.596\nSo be very careful, more specifically\nwhen we say access point,\n\n410\n00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:49.441\nwe're talking about wireless access point.\n\n411\n00:20:49.441 --> 00:20:51.090\nAnd I got a little diagram here I've want.\n\n412\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.561\nKeep in mind, what a wireless\naccess point allows you to do,\n\n413\n00:20:54.561 --> 00:20:57.250\nis connect to a wired network.\n\n414\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.767\nNow that might sound\na little bit confusing.\n\n415\n00:21:00.767 --> 00:21:04.522\nA wireless access point\nis not a wireless device.\n\n416\n00:21:04.522 --> 00:21:06.182\n&gt;&gt; What do we mean by that?\n\n417\n00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:09.812\nYour Internet connections,\nyour connections to your network,\n\n418\n00:21:09.812 --> 00:21:13.590\nat some point, are based on\na wired connection, all right?.\n\n419\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.781\nBut if I have this wireless device,\n\n420\n00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:19.221\nI can't plug a physical cable\ninto the switch, right?\n\n421\n00:21:19.221 --> 00:21:21.620\nSo how am I gonna gain\naccess to my network?\n\n422\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.114\nAnd that's where we use unbounded radiated\nenergy, the wireless device does,\n\n423\n00:21:26.114 --> 00:21:27.898\nto connect to the access point,\n\n424\n00:21:27.898 --> 00:21:30.910\nthat does have a wire running\nto the back of it, okay?\n\n425\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.828\nLet's not try to trick you up here, we're\nnot trying to do, play semantics on you,\n\n426\n00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:37.927\nbut It is something to understand.\n\n427\n00:21:37.927 --> 00:21:43.754\nYour wireless access points allow you\naccess to your wired network, essentially.\n\n428\n00:21:43.754 --> 00:21:45.610\nThey use wireless communications and\n\n429\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.270\nthose wireless technologies that\nwe've talked about in other episodes.\n\n430\n00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.370\nIf you're not aware of it.\n\n431\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.934\nWe did a pretty good job covering a lot\nof the different wireless standards that\n\n432\n00:21:53.934 --> 00:21:55.886\nare associated with these access points.\n\n433\n00:21:55.886 --> 00:21:58.616\nNow moving on, there are a couple\nof other things that they call out.\n\n434\n00:21:58.616 --> 00:22:00.351\nOne of them is kind of interesting.\n\n435\n00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:02.160\nAnd this is what's known as the bridge.\n\n436\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.570\nI do the bridge today, a more common\ntype of bridge that you're gonna see.\n\n437\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.908\nAnd the reason I say this is because when\nwe were moving from hubs into switches\n\n438\n00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:12.256\nthey actually move from a hub to a bridge.\n\n439\n00:22:12.256 --> 00:22:16.042\nAnd that's because you would have two\nwired connections that would plug\n\n440\n00:22:16.042 --> 00:22:19.206\ninto the bridge and what it would\ndo is it would isolate some of\n\n441\n00:22:19.206 --> 00:22:22.960\nthat contention that Dan was\ntalking about, the competition.\n\n442\n00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.399\nAnd if I didn't need to send information\nto a certain set of computers well we can\n\n443\n00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:31.390\nisolate, and I want to send a signal\nout to everybody like the hub does.\n\n444\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.630\nWell, Ihat will be a wired bridge.\n\n445\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.149\nYou can think of a switch as\na multi port wired bridge.\n\n446\n00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:39.694\nThey said hey, it's just more efficient,\nwhy don't we have every one\n\n447\n00:22:39.694 --> 00:22:42.236\nof the computers connect\ndirectly to the device and\n\n448\n00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:45.240\nessentially that's what a switch is today.\n\n449\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.351\nIt's a multi-port bridge.\n\n450\n00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:49.172\nHowever, there are bridges\nthat we do use today, and\n\n451\n00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:52.590\nI'm not talking about the ones\nthat we just drive over, okay?\n\n452\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.567\nWhat we're talking about a lot of times,\nyou have wireless bridges, all right?\n\n453\n00:22:56.567 --> 00:22:59.270\nAnd sometimes, you might need\nto connect two networks, but\n\n454\n00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.550\nthere's a physical limitation on media,\nright?\n\n455\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.460\nI can't lay cable.\n\n456\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.948\nSo you do have the ability to\nuse two access points, right?\n\n457\n00:23:05.948 --> 00:23:09.136\nAnd I have a wired network on one side and\na wired network on the other.\n\n458\n00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:12.728\nMaybe you've got a situation where\nyou can't run copper media, right?\n\n459\n00:23:12.728 --> 00:23:15.049\nAnd maybe it's too expensive\nto run fiber optic media.\n\n460\n00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:16.326\nAnd I'll give you an example,\n\n461\n00:23:16.326 --> 00:23:20.130\nwhen you have things like awnings that\nyou need to run communications across.\n\n462\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.145\nI can't put a copper cable across a public\nopen space like that because what happens?\n\n463\n00:23:24.145 --> 00:23:25.257\nIt becomes a lightning rod.\n\n464\n00:23:25.257 --> 00:23:29.509\nAlright and if lightning hits that cable\nit takes out your whole network especially\n\n465\n00:23:29.509 --> 00:23:30.750\nin that open area.\n\n466\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.776\nBut what I can do is use radiated\nenergy to connect those two networks.\n\n467\n00:23:33.776 --> 00:23:38.658\nWe put an access point essentially on both\nsides of each different wired network and\n\n468\n00:23:38.658 --> 00:23:42.060\nwe allow a wireless\ncommunication across them.\n\n469\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.164\nThat would be considered something\nlike a wireless bridge, right?\n\n470\n00:23:45.164 --> 00:23:47.520\nBridging two dissimilar networks.\n\n471\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.601\nAnd that's what the earlier bridges\nwould do in a wired sense, all right?\n\n472\n00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:56.214\nNow moving on we had some other\ntechnologies that we kinda want to talk\n\n473\n00:23:56.214 --> 00:23:59.720\nabout, we wanna talk about something\nknown as the good old modem.\n\n474\n00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.610\nAll right, modem, so what do we mean here?\n\n475\n00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.360\nAll right, I want you to think\ngoing back to the days of dial up.\n\n476\n00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.280\nYes, we're talking about that little\nannoying sound that would happen\n\n477\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.540\nwhen you would go to connect to\nyour internet service provider,\n\n478\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.670\nyou know the company that's basically\nproviding you your internet connection.\n\n479\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.530\nAnd it would take about two days for\n\n480\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.400\na single webpage to kinda render itself,\nright?\n\n481\n00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.005\nSo wired connections are also dial-ups,\nif you will.\n\n482\n00:24:26.005 --> 00:24:29.615\nDial-up is the form of connection,\nmodem is what it connects through.\n\n483\n00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:32.250\nNow modem, it's interesting.\n\n484\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.456\nModem is actually a combination of two\ndifferent concepts, a modulator and\n\n485\n00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:37.846\na demodulator, right?\n\n486\n00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:39.680\nTo modulate, demodulate, all right?\n\n487\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.150\nAnd what is happening,\nwhat do I mean by that?\n\n488\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.910\nWell when I say modulate, demodulate,\n\n489\n00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.420\nessentially what we're talking\nabout is taking an analog signal.\n\n490\n00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.960\nOur computers don't speak in analog\nsignal, they speak in digital.\n\n491\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.373\nHowever, we have old telephone lines\ncalled the Public Switch Telephone\n\n492\n00:24:53.373 --> 00:24:57.019\nNetworks, or sometimes called plain\nold television, not television.\n\n493\n00:24:57.019 --> 00:24:58.578\n&gt;&gt; Telephone [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Telephone service, right?\n\n494\n00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:00.140\nPOTS lines, too.\n\n495\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.720\nWell, if we have a digital communication,\nessentially,\n\n496\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.200\nthat we need to send along an analog\nsignal or an analog system, which your\n\n497\n00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.130\ntraditional telephone lines are, we need\na way to kind of convert that signal,\n\n498\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.120\nif you will, to allow those two dissimilar\nsystems to communicate between each other.\n\n499\n00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.080\nAnd that's where the modem\ncomes into play.\n\n500\n00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.750\nThat's why they say modulation,\ndemodulation.\n\n501\n00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.820\nWe use modulation schemes that you'll\nlearn a little bit more about in net\n\n502\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.280\nplus like phase-shift keying and stuff,\nand again don't worry about those there,\n\n503\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.202\nbut it's essentially taking the digital\nsignal and converting it to analog.\n\n504\n00:25:32.202 --> 00:25:36.630\nAnd then the recipient signal is analog\nover the Public Switch Telephone Networks,\n\n505\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.070\nand then is turned back\ninto a digital signal\n\n506\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.220\nthat are essentially our computer speed.\n\n507\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.200\nAnd this is where in a past episode\nwe've talked about network connections.\n\n508\n00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.180\nWe talked,\nin fact Dan mentioned it already,\n\n509\n00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.490\nwhat we connect the switches\nis the RJ-45 jack.\n\n510\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.730\nIt's thicker type of jack.\n\n511\n00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.754\nWell, this is the RJ-11 jack,\nright, the traditional [CROSSTALK].\n\n512\n00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:55.390\nYeah exactly.\n\n513\n00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.941\nIt's its small little brother and actually\nI'd say small little older brother, right?\n\n514\n00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:01.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's been around for\n\n515\n00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:02.190\na very long time.\n\n516\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.855\nIt's the small old man essentially.\n\n517\n00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:07.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you might say well dial up,\n\n518\n00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:11.480\nwe don't use dial up today,\nI got cable connections.\n\n519\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.540\nWell, yes, you do use dial-up,\nand let me tell you why.\n\n520\n00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:20.010\nBecause when your ethernet,\nwhen your wired high-speed networks fail,\n\n521\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.010\nwhat typically is still working?\n\n522\n00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.540\nA lot of times it's your dial-up, right?\n\n523\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.940\nWe have a lot of access to telephone\nlines when we do have geographical\n\n524\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.590\nareas that they haven't brought those\ntype of high-speed bandwidth connections.\n\n525\n00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.740\nNow, that does happen even\nin today's modern age.\n\n526\n00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.660\nAnother situation that one of our other\nhosts here, maybe you've seen him before\n\n527\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.940\nDon Pizet, used to work for a company\nthat specialized in disaster recovery.\n\n528\n00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.200\nIn fact, I think the company\nthat you used to work for\n\n529\n00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.800\ndid some kind of disaster\nrecovery as well.\n\n530\n00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.045\nDid you ever have an area where it just\nwiped out something, a natural disaster,\n\n531\n00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:55.968\nand you had to bring in a bank of\nmodems just to maintain a connection?\n\n532\n00:26:55.968 --> 00:26:59.859\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had a server sitting\nin the closet And every now and\n\n533\n00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:02.670\nthen you'd hear the dial-up\nscreaming at you.\n\n534\n00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.280\nAnd you're like that's not good,\nsomebody's having to dial in remotely.\n\n535\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.020\nBecause we live in a modern age, this\nisn't typical to our networks anymore.\n\n536\n00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.160\nBut it's a great backup because\n\n537\n00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.060\nthe telephone system is part\nof critical infrastructure.\n\n538\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.170\nIt's one of the main things that comes\nback online after a natural disaster.\n\n539\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:21.950\nWe live in Florida,\n\n540\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.990\nwe tend to experience natural disasters\nfrom time to time, called hurricanes.\n\n541\n00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.080\nAnd that's an easy way for\nus to get them back online.\n\n542\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.840\nGet claims adjusters, because I work for\nan insurance company.\n\n543\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.050\nGet the claims adjusters,\nthe guys that came out and\n\n544\n00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.857\nchecked how much is actually owed you?\n\n545\n00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:39.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n546\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.550\n&gt;&gt; They figured out the money,\nlike the damage was this much money.\n\n547\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.477\nI forget the rest [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Like a risk assessment [CROSSTALK]\n\n548\n00:27:44.477 --> 00:27:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Like claims adjusters.\n\n549\n00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so you could see.\n\n550\n00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.270\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, there you go.\n\n551\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.120\n&gt;&gt; In that kind of aspect that\nthat's why never say never.\n\n552\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.860\nJust because we're talking about\na technology that was popular in the 80s.\n\n553\n00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.000\nIt's still popular now, and\nit is a last resort thing.\n\n554\n00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.630\nAnd it certainly could be something\nyou see inside of your systems even in\n\n555\n00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.510\na modern age.\n\n556\n00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.680\nSo you have to know about it for the exam.\n\n557\n00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.060\nIn later episodes we're gonna talk\nabout dial up a little bit more and\n\n558\n00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.240\nwe'll talk about things like bandwidth and\nstuff like that.\n\n559\n00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.200\nBut in this episode you want to know\nmore about the device that allows you to\n\n560\n00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.920\nconnect that type of architecture.\n\n561\n00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.150\nHence the name, right,\nnetwork architecture devices.\n\n562\n00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.720\nA few more things that\nwe're gonna wrap up here.\n\n563\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.090\nWe've got what's known as a firewall.\n\n564\n00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.120\nAnd I do wanna talk just\nbriefly about firewalls.\n\n565\n00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.695\nMaybe some of you are aware of a firewall,\nand maybe you're not, all right.\n\n566\n00:28:26.695 --> 00:28:27.875\nI've got a little diagram here, and\n\n567\n00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:29.785\nlet's talk a little bit about firewalls,\nall right?\n\n568\n00:28:29.785 --> 00:28:31.805\nWe've got a few different\ntypes of firewalls.\n\n569\n00:28:31.805 --> 00:28:33.545\nWell, what does a firewall do?\n\n570\n00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:36.485\nAll right,\na firewall basically is what allows or\n\n571\n00:28:36.485 --> 00:28:38.445\ndenies communication types, right?\n\n572\n00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:42.790\nIf I wanna talk to you over a network I\nhave a security-based device that says,\n\n573\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:48.070\nyeah, you can communicate with me or no,\nyou can't communicate with me, right?\n\n574\n00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:53.340\nSo, basically a firewall will\nallow communications or it\n\n575\n00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.440\nwill block communications, and there's all\ndifferent types of ways that this happens.\n\n576\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.875\nOne of the most common ones is through\nsomething known as an access control list\n\n577\n00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:02.395\nwhich, really has a set of rules.\n\n578\n00:29:02.395 --> 00:29:04.677\nIt says if it is this\ntype of communication,\n\n579\n00:29:04.677 --> 00:29:07.150\nallow it through the firewall.\n\n580\n00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.110\nNow, I want you to know even though\nthat we're not really talking\n\n581\n00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.590\nabout security in this episode,\nI do want you to know very basically,\n\n582\n00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:19.060\nfirewalls operate on\nan implicit deny configuration.\n\n583\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:24.238\nWhat we mean by that is any communication\nthat comes into the firewall is typically\n\n584\n00:29:24.238 --> 00:29:29.202\nblocked unless it's explicitly allowed,\nand that's for your protection.\n\n585\n00:29:29.202 --> 00:29:30.650\nIt's a security device.\n\n586\n00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.030\nIt says, if I didn't ask for\nthat communication and\n\n587\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:37.390\nyou didn't tell me it's allowed,\nit's going to be denied, right?\n\n588\n00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.310\nIt's the difference between having\na reservation and being on the list and\n\n589\n00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.870\nthen showing up at the restaurant\nwithout reservations and they say,\n\n590\n00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.807\nI don't see you on the list,\nyou're not gonna eat, right?\n\n591\n00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.800\nOutbound communications,\nmy communication from me to Dan.\n\n592\n00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.730\nDoesn't mean Dan's computer's\ngonna allow me, right?\n\n593\n00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.080\nIt's gonna be blocked unless\nit's expressly allowed.\n\n594\n00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.650\nBut my outbound, my communication\nto Dan is gonna be allowed.\n\n595\n00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.680\nSo communications that come\ninto firewalls without\n\n596\n00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.270\nprior configuration are typically blocked.\n\n597\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.690\nAny communication that goes from\nyour computer to another source\n\n598\n00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.120\nis going to be allowed.\n\n599\n00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.240\nAgain, on the recipient end,\n\n600\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.410\nit doesn't mean that it's gonna be allowed\nexcept if you explicitly allow it.\n\n601\n00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.480\nThat's called an implicit deny.\n\n602\n00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.120\nLast thing I wanna mention on firewalls,\n\n603\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.031\ntwo primary different types network-based\nfirewall versus a host-based firewall.\n\n604\n00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:26.700\nHost-based firewall is like what you\nsee inside of things like Windows.\n\n605\n00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.430\nThat is a software-based firewall and\nit is screening traffic coming to and\n\n606\n00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.130\nfrom the device that it's running on,\nall right?\n\n607\n00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.270\nIt's a software-based firewall.\n\n608\n00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.810\nNetwork based firewalls,\n\n609\n00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.120\nI put them in relationship to\nthe architecture within the network.\n\n610\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.230\nThey screen all information coming\ninto your network from another network\n\n611\n00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.160\nbefore it goes to any device.\n\n612\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.110\nAll devices within your network.\n\n613\n00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.570\nLikewise they also screen all\ntraffic that is sent from\n\n614\n00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.320\nevery device within your\nnetwork off of your network.\n\n615\n00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.520\nIn this case, we used the example\nof the Internet, all right?\n\n616\n00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.670\nSo do know about those firewalls.\n\n617\n00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.740\nAgain, couple other things\nthat we wanna mention.\n\n618\n00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.600\nThey also mention patch panels.\n\n619\n00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.542\nAll right, when we talk about patch\npanels, what we're talking about is\n\n620\n00:31:09.542 --> 00:31:13.356\nwhat every wired connection,\nif you will, well, wired connection to\n\n621\n00:31:13.356 --> 00:31:17.999\nyour network essentially goes up through\nthe structural wiring within the building,\n\n622\n00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:21.074\ncomes down into a closet\ncalled a communication closet.\n\n623\n00:31:21.074 --> 00:31:23.120\nA lot of times we call\nthese server closets.\n\n624\n00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.210\nAnd they connect to a central point,\nthat's the patch panel.\n\n625\n00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.690\nWe got an example of one right here.\n\n626\n00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.440\nYou can see all of these\ndifferent wired connections.\n\n627\n00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.400\nAgain If you were to lay this out and\n\n628\n00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.820\nyou were to look at it from a top down\nview it'd look like a bunch of spaghetti.\n\n629\n00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.760\nBut they go through the structural wiring\nwithin your building, down into a single\n\n630\n00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.530\npoint, and they plug in, essentially\nconnecting a pair of ports together.\n\n631\n00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.410\nWe also have repeaters and extenders.\n\n632\n00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.006\nHubs could be a form of a repeater or\nextender.\n\n633\n00:31:50.006 --> 00:31:52.094\nAny kind of repeater extender, guys,\n\n634\n00:31:52.094 --> 00:31:55.782\nsays that there's a maximum\ntransmission distance on that medium.\n\n635\n00:31:55.782 --> 00:31:59.609\nOnce you get to that maximum transmission\ndistance, if you go past it, and\n\n636\n00:31:59.609 --> 00:32:03.739\nlet's say we're making our own cables,\nyou run the risk of two things, right,\n\n637\n00:32:03.739 --> 00:32:06.020\nsignal loss as well as signal degradation.\n\n638\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.810\nIt's called signal attenuation.\n\n639\n00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.540\nThat's the progressive degradation\nof a signal as it goes\n\n640\n00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.910\npast whatever the standard length is for\nthat type of media.\n\n641\n00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:20.500\nIf it hits a repeater or an extender,\nif you will, that device\n\n642\n00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:26.120\nregenerates the signal back into\nits original strength, if you will.\n\n643\n00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.039\nAnd can extend or repeat it to another\ncertain amount of length, right?\n\n644\n00:32:32.425 --> 00:32:35.590\nThere's also what's known as\nEthernet over power, okay?\n\n645\n00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.280\nAnd there's also what's known\nas power over Ethernet.\n\n646\n00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.880\nWhat the heck are we talking about there,\nall right?\n\n647\n00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.990\nSo let's start with something\nknown as POE, Power Over Ethernet.\n\n648\n00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.040\nSee these cables right here.\n\n649\n00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.170\nThese are Ethernet based cables or\ncopper based media.\n\n650\n00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.960\nAnd a lot of times all they have\nrunning across them is data.\n\n651\n00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.090\nBut there are times when it's not feasible\nto run an AC adapter to it from a device\n\n652\n00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.340\nto an electrical location.\n\n653\n00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.360\nSo guess what?\n\n654\n00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.020\nNot only, it's copper-based media.\n\n655\n00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.115\nGuess what electrical wires are made of?\n\n656\n00:33:03.115 --> 00:33:03.615\nCopper.\n&gt;&gt; Copper.\n\n657\n00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:04.115\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n658\n00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:07.195\nhow convenient that we can-\n&gt;&gt; I hear that they conduct electricity\n\n659\n00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:08.625\npretty well.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty well, right?\n\n660\n00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:11.405\nSo how convenient is it that\nwe can have a device that\n\n661\n00:33:11.405 --> 00:33:15.965\nliterally injects an electrical\ncurrent into that data cable.\n\n662\n00:33:15.965 --> 00:33:17.275\nThat's power over Ethernet,\n\n663\n00:33:17.275 --> 00:33:21.565\nit allows us to power devices that\notherwise we wouldn't be able to run\n\n664\n00:33:21.565 --> 00:33:25.430\nbecause we don't have an AC adapter\nto plug them into the wall.\n\n665\n00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.700\nNow the other flip side to that is,\nwe also have power and guess what?\n\n666\n00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.180\nPower cables use copper.\n\n667\n00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.560\nWell guess what your data cables use too?\n\n668\n00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.090\nDaniel, can you help me out with that?\n\n669\n00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with copper.\n\n670\n00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.105\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's right.\n\n671\n00:33:36.105 --> 00:33:37.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dan for the win on that one and\n\n672\n00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.180\nthat's right.\n\n673\n00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.250\nWe joke around, but it's true, right?\n\n674\n00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.250\nSo we already have power cables and\nthey have come up with technologies, and\n\n675\n00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.200\nthese could be considered things\nlike range extenders as well.\n\n676\n00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.440\nWhere I can actually plug a device right\ninto the electrical outlet and guess what?\n\n677\n00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:56.500\nPut an Ethernet cable into it, put\na copper cable into it, and now I'm gonna\n\n678\n00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.602\nsend my data signal across the electrical\ninfrastructure inside of the building.\n\n679\n00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:03.970\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be a lot of money in\nhaving to wire the entire building for\n\n680\n00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:04.550\nEthernet, right?\n\n681\n00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.480\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n682\n00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.370\nWe talk about using wireless,\nmore so because we have\n\n683\n00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:12.770\nthat limitation of physical cabling, well\nif you do, now you have options right?\n\n684\n00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.790\nYou don't have to necessarily go wireless.\n\n685\n00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.980\nYou can extend your wired communications\n\n686\n00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.340\nby essentially sending it through\nyour power-based infrastructure.\n\n687\n00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.250\nSo guys and gals out there,\na lot of difference technologies.\n\n688\n00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.210\nWe hope we've made them\na little bit clearer for you.\n\n689\n00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.960\nKnow where you would see some of these\ndevices and also know some of, we talked\n\n690\n00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.070\na little bit about some of the logic\nbehind them and what they're looking at.\n\n691\n00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.840\nYou'll learn a lot more\nabout this is Network+,\n\n692\n00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.050\nbut this should really be good for\nthe A+ exam.\n\n693\n00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:39.740\nKeep in mind the functionality,\n\n694\n00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.040\nwhere you would see these\ndevices within your networks and\n\n695\n00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.600\nwhat their general use will be and\nyou should be doing for your A+ exam.\n\n696\n00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.607\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\ngreat stuff, love networking.\n\n697\n00:34:48.607 --> 00:34:51.550\nIt's where I cut my teeth, it's how I\ngot into the biz cuz I love networking.\n\n698\n00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.660\nI think it's a lot of fun.\n\n699\n00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.160\nHopefully you guys found this episode\nenlightening and entertaining as well,\n\n700\n00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.180\nI know I sure did.\n\n701\n00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.820\nWe thank you Wes for dropping by and\nwe thank our audience for watching.\n\n702\n00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.873\nBut, yep, it's that time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n703\n00:35:03.873 --> 00:35:05.200\nI've been your host, Daniel

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.639\nWelcome to ITProTV I'm\nyour host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.503\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:08.592\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:12.065\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:13.868\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.642\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:20.759\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode it's all about that A+,\n\n8\n00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.860\nspecifically the 22901\nif you're keeping score.\n\n9\n00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.976\nAnd joining us in the studio again\ntoday our good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:29.760\nWes we're glad to have you again sir,\nand how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great in fact,\n\n12\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.330\ncuz we've done a lot of\nthese episodes together.\n\n13\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.085\nI keep thinking maybe I'm on the wrong\nexam code, cuz I'm thinking 22901.\n\n14\n00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.380\nOkay I got it the dash is somewhere else.\n\n15\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.150\nBut other than that guys that's\nright I'm doing great here.\n\n16\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.938\nAnd like Dan says well,\nwe're gonna be looking at laptops today.\n\n17\n00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:52.150\nAnd we're gonna be looking at some of the\nfeatures and the components within them.\n\n18\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.940\nAnd boy have they changed over the years.\n\n19\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.860\nOne of the great things though is for\n\n20\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.124\nthe most part a computer is\na computer is a computer, right?\n\n21\n00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:02.107\nIt just really depends on how much\nmoney you have to spend on one and\n\n22\n00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:04.874\nreally what the functionality is,\nthe the role if you will,\n\n23\n00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:06.899\nof a computer within our networks, right?\n\n24\n00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.126\nWe have from the smallest computers today,\nin things like IoT we talk about\n\n25\n00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:15.691\nInternet of Things where the computer is\na really just an RM-based processor and\n\n26\n00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:17.910\nthey call it a SOC, system on a chip.\n\n27\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.430\nEverything's built into the PC or\nPCB if you will.\n\n28\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.120\nThen we get a little bit bigger here, and\n\n29\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.726\nwe can have things like the TV top boxes,\nthe top set boxes, I guess.\n\n30\n00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:29.296\n&gt;&gt; Set top boxes.\n\n31\n00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Set top boxes.\n\n32\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.195\nI got that wrong last time too,\nI'm glad you're here Dan.\n\n33\n00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.007\n[LAUGH] And\nthey're a little big bigger and\n\n34\n00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:40.236\ntheir functionality is a lot of times\nDVRs or bringing in cabled television.\n\n35\n00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:43.390\nAnd allowing you to tune in and\nthen you get a little bit bigger, right?\n\n36\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.750\nYou got tablets and\ndon't forget cell phones, right?\n\n37\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.220\nBut really when you look at it,\nall the way up to the work station or\n\n38\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.630\neven the servers that we talk about that\nhave a lot of RAM in them, a lot of CPUs\n\n39\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.700\ngenerate a lot of heat and very powerful,\nthey're really all doing the same thing.\n\n40\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.120\nNow, one of the things that differentiates\nlaptops, some of the things that we have\n\n41\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.450\nto consider when it comes to laptops\nis really two things, right?\n\n42\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.260\nThe main thing is battery life, right?\n\n43\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.520\nI mean, when we talk about mobility, it's\nall about how long the battery lasts and\n\n44\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.060\nover the years, they've definitely gone so\n\n45\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.760\nfar when it comes to how long\nthese batteries are lasting.\n\n46\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.390\nDan I can think about some of\nthe earlier NiCad batteries where you'd\n\n47\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.110\ncharge them for five hours and\nyou might even get 45 minutes use.\n\n48\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.158\nYou remember some of those?\n\n49\n00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those things were the, you think,\nwell it's rechargeable so not a huge deal.\n\n50\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.172\nExcept it's a huge deal,\nit was a pain [LAUGH].\n\n51\n00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:34.197\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and then they would\nsuffer from things like the memory effect,\n\n52\n00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:37.739\nwhere you would charge it, and\nyou would charge it for five hours, and\n\n53\n00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.450\nit'd only give you half the actual charge.\n\n54\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.720\nThey had a memory retention, and for the\nmost part, I gotta be careful saying this.\n\n55\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.520\nCuz you never say never, but\nwe use lithium ion batteries more.\n\n56\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.860\nMost popular battery today is\nthe lithium ion type battery.\n\n57\n00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.640\nAnd that battery really doesn't\nsuffer from the memory effect.\n\n58\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.954\nBut again, it has a certain life\nspan that you have to keep in mind,\n\n59\n00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:01.205\nthat over time it's a cell right?\n\n60\n00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:04.810\nAnd what are you doing, you're putting\na charge in the cell and you're removing\n\n61\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.300\nthat charge in the cell, and over a period\nof time the cell just can't hold charges.\n\n62\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.120\nSo battery life back to the point here\nbefore I get too far off the beaten track.\n\n63\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.490\nBattery life is definitely\nsomething that is a major concern.\n\n64\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.140\nHow long does the battery last,\nhow long could I go without\n\n65\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.605\nplugging that in to some kind of external\nadapter, or external power source?\n\n66\n00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:29.140\nThe next thing, if battery life\nis one of the most crucial,\n\n67\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.640\nis proper thermal management, heating.\n\n68\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.740\nWe really have to worry about heating,\nor overheating I should say, inside of\n\n69\n00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.070\na laptop because of the fact that well,\nthey're fairly small form factors.\n\n70\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.045\nIn fact, we've got a laptop,\nif we could look at the SkyCam here,\n\n71\n00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:44.386\nthis is a more modern laptop.\n\n72\n00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:47.656\nAnd we've got another old one here\nthat we're gonna kinda break here and\n\n73\n00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.810\ntear apart and\nshow you guys some of the pieces.\n\n74\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.280\nBecause again, for the most part,\nthe components really haven't changed.\n\n75\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.210\nIt's just everything gets smaller,\nright, and faster.\n\n76\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.220\nBut if you look at that,\nwe don't have a lot of space, right?\n\n77\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.100\nAnd it's not like our desktops, and\n\n78\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.510\nour gaming desktops where we\nhave a big case there and\n\n79\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.730\nwe can put 42 fans in it, and we can just\npull in cool air and exhaust the hot air.\n\n80\n00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.610\nI don't really have too much space here\nand in fact it's kinda hard to see.\n\n81\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.890\nBut that's the exhaust on this Mac that's\nactually the exhaust vent right there, and\n\n82\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.920\nyou can see that if I would stack up,\nI don't know if I took a guess about four\n\n83\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.270\nquarters it would be about\nfour quarters in height.\n\n84\n00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.470\nThere's not a lot of space.\n\n85\n00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.318\nSo when we look at that, keep in mind that\nnot only do we worry about the battery\n\n86\n00:04:30.318 --> 00:04:33.478\nlife, but we are also worry\nabout proper thermal management.\n\n87\n00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:36.592\nThose are the two major contributing\nfactors when it comes to laptops and\n\n88\n00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:39.144\nit's really something that you\nhave to be concerned with,\n\n89\n00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:42.021\nwhen you talk about being an A +\ntechnicians of some sort, right?\n\n90\n00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:45.654\nBecause the other thing is, with thermal\nmanagement, if we don't have, and\n\n91\n00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:48.750\nI'm talking heat guys,\nlet's take the jargon out of it, right.\n\n92\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.650\nWe don't want things overheating, right?\n\n93\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.740\nIf we don't have proper\nthermal management,\n\n94\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.380\nproper cooling within a system,\nit could be very problematic.\n\n95\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.210\nWe're gonna have problems, right?\n\n96\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.767\nOne of the obvious things\nthat you can see is,\n\n97\n00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:05.696\nwhen your computer starts shutting down,\nrandom reboots, that's a telltale sign.\n\n98\n00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:07.451\nIt could be memory for sure, but\n\n99\n00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.490\nit's a telltale sign that you've got\nsome kind of overheating going on.\n\n100\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.910\nIn fact most of the modern CPUs,\nand again,\n\n101\n00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.870\nI don't care what the platform is, they\nhave these thermal temperature sensors\n\n102\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.030\nthat are built into the CPU itself.\n\n103\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.370\nAnd what it can do is go into\na thermal shutdown right?\n\n104\n00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.010\nAnd if that happens,\n\n105\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.560\nagain that's a telltale sign that your\ncomputer isn't cooling itself properly.\n\n106\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.280\nAnd what's happening is it's overheating.\n\n107\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.591\nSo those are some of the things that\nI kinda wanna set the stage for\n\n108\n00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.912\nwhen it comes to what you\nare considering with laptops, right?\n\n109\n00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:41.931\nNow we've got plenty of different\ncomponents inside of these devices, and\n\n110\n00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:44.400\nlike l said for the most part,\nthey really haven't changed.\n\n111\n00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.930\nThere are some things that have gone by\nthe way side, because well as technology\n\n112\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.524\nmoves on, some of the things that we used\nto use, that we kinda laughed at today.\n\n113\n00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:54.650\nAnd say well, you're really only gonna see\nthose in a museum more than you're gonna\n\n114\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.940\nactually see them in the devices.\n\n115\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.100\nBut there are still a few of these things\nthat you have to know for the A+ exam.\n\n116\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.550\nAll right, some of the technologies,\nagain you might say,\n\n117\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.300\nI've never seen one of those in my life.\n\n118\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.220\nWell never say never because again, you\ncould see some of these components right?\n\n119\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.990\nWe have things like storage devices,\nnow the storage devices really aren't any\n\n120\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.140\ndifferent than what we have in\nour modern computers today,\n\n121\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.660\nyou know full size computers.\n\n122\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.101\nBut again, they're smaller,\nwe have the serial ATA, and\n\n123\n00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:24.310\nthey can be mechanical drives,\nspinning platters inside of them.\n\n124\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.629\nWe have, more common today,\nsolid state drives.\n\n125\n00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.791\nAnd these drives, again,\nthey're gonna look just like the same but\n\n126\n00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:32.120\nthe form factor's a little bit different.\n\n127\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.570\nWe talk about form factor of a hard drive,\nwe're talking about two and\n\n128\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.570\na half-inch form factor vs\nthe three-inch form factor of your full\n\n129\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.780\nsize desktop PCs or\neven really server and storage devices.\n\n130\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.610\nIn fact, we've got a couple\nof these drives right here.\n\n131\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.540\nIf we could pull them up from the Sky Cam,\n\n132\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.370\nyou'll see that I've got a couple of them,\nright?\n\n133\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.740\nNow, this is a traditional\nmechanical drive, right?\n\n134\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.968\nAnd if I turn it over, you can see\nthat here's the controller board.\n\n135\n00:06:56.968 --> 00:07:01.870\nThis is a serial ATA interface, and\nyou can see we've got right here\n\n136\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.435\nwe've got our 15 pin serial\nATA L-shaped power connector.\n\n137\n00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:11.250\nAnd we've got the seven-pin data\nconnector, the seven-pin data cable.\n\n138\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.890\nNow one of the great\nthings about these and\n\n139\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.650\nwe're gonna take a look at here at\nhow these attach to our devices.\n\n140\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.890\nIt is the fact that\na lot of these kinda fit\n\n141\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.190\ninto a connection that you\ndon't really need the cables.\n\n142\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.900\nSo and that's because the data cable and\n\n143\n00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.390\nthe power is integrated directly into\nthe motherboard itself, or it's a separate\n\n144\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:34.170\nlittle assembly that plugs on the back\nside, plugs into the motherboard itself.\n\n145\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.410\nBut again you can see that these are\nreally no different than what you'd see in\n\n146\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.180\nour full size drives.\n\n147\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.220\nAgain, the three and\na half inch form factor.\n\n148\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.240\nAnd again, this one has spinning\nplatters that are inside of it, right?\n\n149\n00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.068\nNow one of the things that is kinda\ninteresting about this is the platters on\n\n150\n00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:51.033\nthese, Dan, can actually be glass.\n\n151\n00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:54.464\nI've actually taken a couple of these\nolder drives apart just to kinda see\n\n152\n00:07:54.464 --> 00:07:55.633\nwhat's inside of them.\n\n153\n00:07:55.633 --> 00:08:00.202\nAnd they really do look Much the same, but\nthe difference is, when you try to remove\n\n154\n00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:03.810\none of the platters, you really\nhave to be careful, not so much.\n\n155\n00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.930\nI mean, if you open these drives guys,\nyou're pretty much ruined, am I right?\n\n156\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.100\nAnd that's because the platters\nhave positioning and\n\n157\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.690\nbalancing that goes on them and\nit's always unique to the drive itself.\n\n158\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.370\nI could have five of the same exact drive,\n\n159\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.930\nsame model, same manufacturer and the\nbalancing can be a little bit different.\n\n160\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.230\nThey have very, very fine tolerances.\n\n161\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.890\nDan I know you're into engines and\nstuff, and\n\n162\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.370\ntiming is everything right, in an engine?\n\n163\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.910\nWhat happens if your timing gets\noff just slightly in an engine?\n\n164\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.524\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well when you get the timing\noff in an engine you have what's called\n\n165\n00:08:33.524 --> 00:08:37.098\npre-ignition which causes bad things\ninside of a combustion chamber.\n\n166\n00:08:37.098 --> 00:08:37.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.955\n&gt;&gt; Which can,\nit's small explosions at the wrong time.\n\n168\n00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:41.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n169\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.040\nif we take that back to a hard drive, if\nyour timing is off just a little bit then\n\n170\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.460\nthe read write heads don't position\nthemselves inside of the drive.\n\n171\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.640\nEssentially what you get is\ndata corruption or data loss.\n\n172\n00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.440\nSo understand when I tell you guys,\nI've taken these apart.\n\n173\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.650\nWell I know Dan, I know you've\nbusted a couple of these open too.\n\n174\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.100\nWe're doing it for curiosity.\n\n175\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.710\nAnd it's usually because\nlike this drive here,\n\n176\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.960\nwe're gonna open this one\nup here in the show and\n\n177\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.148\nshow you what it looks like here when we\nget into actually looking at the pieces.\n\n178\n00:09:06.148 --> 00:09:09.640\nYou're not gonna be able to put it back\ntogether and read the information.\n\n179\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.410\nHowever, I will tell you,\non these devices,\n\n180\n00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.270\nthese drives here,\nwhen you open them, be very careful.\n\n181\n00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.228\nBecause I've actually tried\ntaking all the screws out,\n\n182\n00:09:18.228 --> 00:09:22.240\nand when you go try to remove the platter\nit shatters into many, many pieces.\n\n183\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.190\nAnd the pieces are glass.\n\n184\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.360\nSo you can only imagine taking some\nkind of glass bottle and throwing it on\n\n185\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.170\nthe floor, and all the little shards\nthat can definitely get into your hand.\n\n186\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.890\nSo, be very careful when I say that.\n\n187\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.050\nNow, this other one here you'll see,\nit doesn't really look too much different.\n\n188\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.960\nIf we take a look here in the sky cam.\n\n189\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.680\nThis one doesn't really look\nmuch different, all right?\n\n190\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.930\nBut what's interesting about this one\nis this is a solid-state drive, right?\n\n191\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.400\nThis doesn't have the moving\nparts inside of it.\n\n192\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.090\nThis actually has, well,\nNAND flash memory, right?\n\n193\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.930\nThe memory chips like USB external\nthumb drives that we've talked about.\n\n194\n00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.800\nAnd again, the form factor is the same,\nbut inside of it, what you're gonna\n\n195\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.690\nsee is a whole bunch of memory chips\nrather than these internal platters.\n\n196\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.960\nSo, that's a little bit about some of\nthe storage devices that you have and\n\n197\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.090\nwe'll look at those a little bit more.\n\n198\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:15.990\nNow we also have to set from time to time\nexpand the functionality of our laptops.\n\n199\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.020\nSometimes the laptops don't have complete\n\n200\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.710\nall the functionality built\nin to it that you want.\n\n201\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.600\nAnd just like we talk about workstations,\n\n202\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.810\nthat's because of the fact that you\ncould bring the price point down, right?\n\n203\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.560\nYou can go to a store.\n\n204\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.420\nYou can buy a laptop that cost you $400 or\n$500 dollars.\n\n205\n00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.218\nAnd when you turn it on it's not gonna\ndim the lights three houses over.\n\n206\n00:10:38.218 --> 00:10:42.210\nIt's not gonna be like the alien, where\nlaptops that are really, really good or\n\n207\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.430\na digital store customized laptop or\nan ROC republic or gamer type laptop.\n\n208\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.570\nIn the fact that it's not gonna have a lot\nof the heavy hitting hardware that we\n\n209\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.758\nwant, and\nmaybe not even a lot of the functionality.\n\n210\n00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:58.036\nBut one of the great things about these\nlaptops is that they sometimes have ports\n\n211\n00:10:58.036 --> 00:11:03.420\non the outside of them that will allow\nyou to add additional functionality.\n\n212\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.340\nNow the next topic that we're\ngonna talk about is really,\n\n213\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.110\nit's a bus architecture and\nit's been around for a while.\n\n214\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.570\nAnd you're starting to see less and\nless of it today because for\n\n215\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.990\nthe most part we're using dongles,\nwhich we'll talk about those coming up.\n\n216\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.910\nOr you have the ports built into\nthe machine already that will\n\n217\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.150\njust allow you to plug in some\nkind of connection interface.\n\n218\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.010\nAnd what I'm talking about is\nsomething known as ExpressCard.\n\n219\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.740\nNow earlier, let's go way back,\nwe're gonna take a trip in time,\n\n220\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.670\nright with our deloriud 88.5\nmiles an hour, like I say.\n\n221\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.920\nWe had what's known as the PCMCIA card,\n\n222\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.140\nthat's the Personal Computer Memory\nCard International Association.\n\n223\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.720\nThey were responsible for\nreally overseeing the standard.\n\n224\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.050\nNow they've been a dissolved body for\na very long time and what happened was,\n\n225\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.150\nthey basically took all technologies and\nstandards that they were overseeing and\n\n226\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.810\nhand it over to special interest\ngroup called the USB forum.\n\n227\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.950\nAnd the USB forum is what we see today,\nthey're the ones that oversee all\n\n228\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.330\nthe current USB standards and they've\nbeen overseeing these card factors.\n\n229\n00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.510\nAnd again, I want you to keep in mind,\nlike USB it is a bus architecture, right?\n\n230\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.560\nSo not only is it something\nthat explains the card\n\n231\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.700\nthat you would stick into the laptop,\nbut also explains the interface and\n\n232\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.910\nthe communication types that's\nintegrated into the motherboards itself.\n\n233\n00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.100\nAnd for the most part the USB\nacross all motherboards.\n\n234\n00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.130\nWhether it be a laptop or\nwhether it be some kind of workstation.\n\n235\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.064\nNow ExpressCard had,\n\n236\n00:12:23.064 --> 00:12:26.322\nthey called out a couple different kinds\nthat we wanna be aware of for the exam.\n\n237\n00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:29.153\nAnd again, it might be something that you\nhave do a little bit of your research.\n\n238\n00:12:29.153 --> 00:12:31.869\nWe're gonna show you some of\nthe commonalities here and\n\n239\n00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:34.193\nsome of the things you need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n240\n00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:37.757\nBut I encourage you guys to go out there\nand research it a little bit more because\n\n241\n00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.550\nit's one of those things that at a certain\npoint, you might only see it in a museum.\n\n242\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.850\nAnd sometimes people don't even\nsee them at all in these laptops.\n\n243\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.080\nAnd we'll show you that\ncomparative like the MacBook and\n\n244\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.130\nan older like Dell PC\nbased laptop that we have.\n\n245\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:50.930\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n246\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.400\nmy computer here on my screen, I've pulled\nup a couple of standards that they call.\n\n247\n00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.317\nNow, one of the things I like about\nthis standard is the fact that\n\n248\n00:13:00.317 --> 00:13:04.820\nthe standard's name defines\nthe width of the card, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.840\nSo don't let this confuse you.\n\n250\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.480\nYou're gonna see ExpressCard 34,\nExpressCard 54.\n\n251\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.696\nWhat's the difference?\n\n252\n00:13:10.696 --> 00:13:15.034\nIt's the phone factor, the card,\nthe communication type is identical and\n\n253\n00:13:15.034 --> 00:13:18.625\nI love it on the exam when you can\nremember one specification and\n\n254\n00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:22.457\nit really applies to both of\nthe different ExpressCards, right?\n\n255\n00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:27.244\nSo ExpressCard was the successor\nto the earlier PC cards that were\n\n256\n00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:29.540\ncalled PCMCIA Cards, right?\n\n257\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.530\nThe PCMCIA Card or PC card if you will,\n\n258\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:37.940\nwhat this was was essentially,\nit's an extension of the PCI Interface.\n\n259\n00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.013\nAnd the PCI Interface like\nwe've talked about and\n\n260\n00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:44.050\nother bus architectures in A plus here\nwas a very limited interface, right?\n\n261\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.210\nIt was a shared bus topology which means\nyou can have five cards and because of\n\n262\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.050\nthe parallel communication, you can get\nall kinds of cross talk and everything.\n\n263\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.717\nWell, they came up with\na successor to that, right?\n\n264\n00:13:53.717 --> 00:13:56.540\nUsing something known\nas card bus technology.\n\n265\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.845\nAnd this is the ExpressCard.\n\n266\n00:13:58.845 --> 00:14:02.610\nExpressCard gives you access,\nand they still use it today.\n\n267\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.991\nAgain, a lot of this functionality really\nis built into the motherboards today.\n\n268\n00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:10.895\nBut it gives you access to things like\nPCIE interface, it gives you access to\n\n269\n00:14:10.895 --> 00:14:14.540\nthings like USB 3.0,\nit has the potential to do that as well.\n\n270\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.440\nAnd again,\nwhen it comes to ExpressCard 34,\n\n271\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.240\nwe're talking 34 millimeters in width,\nright, so a thin card.\n\n272\n00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.760\nYou're also talking about ExpressCard 54,\n\n273\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:34.470\nyou're talking about a wider card that\nreally doesn't differ too much, right?\n\n274\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.800\nAgain, like I said you could see a PC.\n\n275\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.390\nAgain, I wanna say PCMCIA.\n\n276\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.480\nThe ExpressCard 54,\nit's 54 millimeters wide.\n\n277\n00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.640\nNow I also want you to know and\nthey don't call out on the exam.\n\n278\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.840\nBut remember, here at ITProTV,\nit's not always about what's on the exam.\n\n279\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.720\nWe wanna give you some\ngood real world stuff too.\n\n280\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.030\nNotice you might say well, what\nare these compatible with one another?\n\n281\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:01.092\nThe 54 doesn't fit in the 34 slot,\nbut it does work the other way.\n\n282\n00:15:01.092 --> 00:15:04.380\nNotice that they're\nboth 26 pin connectors?\n\n283\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:09.500\nYou will have some laptops\nthat have a 54 inch\n\n284\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.690\nwide slot on the case itself and\nyou can put the 34 right in it, right?\n\n285\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.520\n&gt;&gt; And there's no real purpose for\nthe difference in the width?\n\n286\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, hard drives,\nhard drives versus things.\n\n287\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.019\nLet's talk, that's a great question.\n\n288\n00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:24.324\nLet's talk about some of the utilizations\nof these devices, I'm glad you asked.\n\n289\n00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:28.780\nThe 54 could be used for things like hard\ndrives, so expand storage interfaces.\n\n290\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.712\nWhere you would have the 34s which could\nalso do that, they could have flash memory\n\n291\n00:15:32.712 --> 00:15:35.820\non them as well, but\nthey would be for network adapters.\n\n292\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.205\nI had one for a while that would allow\nyou to connect an Ethernet adapter or\n\n293\n00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:43.080\na RJ 45 jack connector Ethernet\ncable if you didn't have one.\n\n294\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.020\nAgain, you might say, well,\nWes, I've got a laptop and\n\n295\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.970\nI've got a wireless interface and\nI've got an Ethernet adapter built in.\n\n296\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.969\nThat's right.\nYou do.\n\n297\n00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:50.762\nBut remember,\n\n298\n00:15:50.762 --> 00:15:55.096\nthis ExpressCard technology was about\nexpanding the functionality of a computer.\n\n299\n00:15:55.096 --> 00:16:00.101\nI could buy a PC that wasn't $800 and\nThat seems like yesterday's news,\n\n300\n00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:05.030\nbecause who wouldn't buy some kinda\nlaptop with a wired connection today?\n\n301\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.990\nBut we have laptops here that don't\nhave Ethernet adapters at all.\n\n302\n00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.770\nSo we have to use dongles.\n\n303\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.462\nNow back to the point here,\nthe ExpressCard,\n\n304\n00:16:12.462 --> 00:16:17.102\nthe 34 commonly would be used to add\nthings like wireless functionality too.\n\n305\n00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:21.251\nYou would see one that you would\nstick in the expansion card slot.\n\n306\n00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:24.929\nAnd what would happen is it'd have\na little dipole antenna on it and\n\n307\n00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:29.216\nwouls give you access to, essentially,\nyour WiFi communication, right.\n\n308\n00:16:29.216 --> 00:16:35.054\nOr wired Ethernet, or this is gonna sound\nreally obsolete may be even a modem,\n\n309\n00:16:35.054 --> 00:16:37.895\nright, you can modem capabilities.\n\n310\n00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:42.677\nAnd l know a lot of people they will say,\nmodems, are you kidding me?\n\n311\n00:16:42.677 --> 00:16:46.597\nWell l have mentioned Dan, and\nDan's talked about that before,\n\n312\n00:16:46.597 --> 00:16:50.671\nin a business that he worked for,\nwhere they had to go into DR sites.\n\n313\n00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:52.778\nAnd you might not have\nan Ethernet connection,\n\n314\n00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.000\nyour wired Ethernet might be down and\nguess what?\n\n315\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.341\nThe only way that you're gonna communicate\nwith the outside world is with traditional\n\n316\n00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:02.330\nPSTN lines that are already there, right?\n\n317\n00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.270\nSo that is something that\ncould be a possibility.\n\n318\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.490\nNow that really takes\ncare of the express card,\n\n319\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.260\nthere is one other one\nthat I wanna mention.\n\n320\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.890\nDan and I, I believe, mentioned it in\nanother episode, but I wanna bring it back\n\n321\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:23.930\nin because it really is\nrelative to your laptops.\n\n322\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.142\nAnd that's Mini PCI and Mini PCIe.\n\n323\n00:17:26.142 --> 00:17:28.106\nYeah, I know I don't have\nthese on our notes here, but\n\n324\n00:17:28.106 --> 00:17:29.880\nit's cuz we've already covered them.\n\n325\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.520\nBut we should bring them real\nquick into our laptop section.\n\n326\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.890\nRemember, Mini PCI as type one,\ntwo and three and\n\n327\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.070\nagain, these largely were used for\nthings like memory cards and\n\n328\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.420\nagain, the potential for\nhard drives that's not common today.\n\n329\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.330\nIt's many PCIE,\na much faster bus interface.\n\n330\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.110\nWe're not gonna go over the specifics,\nguys, cuz we took care of PCIe and\n\n331\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.950\nPCI in another episode.\n\n332\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.040\nBut keep in mind that those\nare used inside of your laptops.\n\n333\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.650\nAnd you can use them today for things\nlike your wireless network adapters.\n\n334\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.810\nYou can use them for\nstorage devices as well.\n\n335\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.610\nBut again these are gonna be\nsomething that's integrated into\n\n336\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.700\nthe motherboard themselves.\n\n337\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.200\nNow that being said, the only thing\nthat we can also see inside of our\n\n338\n00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.920\ncomputers today is\nsomething known as SODIMM.\n\n339\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.590\nRight, we've also taken care of SODIMM\nin another episode where we talk partly\n\n340\n00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.914\nextensively about memory.\n\n341\n00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:24.007\nRemember, memory remember,\n\n342\n00:18:24.007 --> 00:18:28.283\n[LAUGH] that SODIMM is small\noutline duel inline memory module.\n\n343\n00:18:28.283 --> 00:18:31.259\nAnd Dan and I actually have a laptop\nhere where we'll show you one,\n\n344\n00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:33.090\nwe'll take one out a laptop.\n\n345\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.250\nWhen it comes to the specifications,\ngo and check out our memory app\n\n346\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.090\nepisodes because there are different\nrevisions right to them.\n\n347\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.875\nJust means, that if you take one\nof the traditional memory modules,\n\n348\n00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:45.806\ncut it right in half,\nthat's the form factor.\n\n349\n00:18:45.806 --> 00:18:47.464\nAnd a lot of times they double stack,\n\n350\n00:18:47.464 --> 00:18:50.953\nwhere they have instead of just four\nchips, they had eight chips in two rows.\n\n351\n00:18:50.953 --> 00:18:55.198\nThey could be DDR, pretty much gone\nby the wayside, DDR2, DDR3, and\n\n352\n00:18:55.198 --> 00:19:00.000\neven today something that you don't have\nto worry about on the exam is JDex current\n\n353\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.201\nrevision of DDR4.\n\n354\n00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:05.550\nAll right, that is the memory modules\nthat you see with inside of your laptops.\n\n355\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.810\nNow speaking of memory as well,\nguess what?\n\n356\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.900\nSometimes you don't even\nhave the ability to remove\n\n357\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.460\nmemory modules because what they've\ndone is they've integrated flash memory.\n\n358\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.400\nFlash memory right there on\nthe motherboard could be a little card,\n\n359\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.160\nI mean don't get me wrong,\nyou could see a flash memory module.\n\n360\n00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.970\nBut for the most part, flash memory is\ndefinitely gonna be in these very small,\n\n361\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.560\nform factor, very thin devices\nwhere there is not a lot of room.\n\n362\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.620\nSo what do they do?\n\n363\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.590\nThe manufacturer decides, of the PCB,\nhey, we're gonna take that memory module,\n\n364\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.900\nthat non-volatile memory.\n\n365\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.480\nIt's very expensive, very fast,\n\n366\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.520\nvery good, and we're gonna integrate\nit right into the motherboard.\n\n367\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.670\nAnd we're gonna use it instead of, for\nsystem memory, we're gonna use it for\n\n368\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.630\nstorage, right?\n\n369\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.990\nAnd then, again, you get the high\nspeed storage that you would have.\n\n370\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.008\nCould be a flash,\nyou know when we talk about flash.\n\n371\n00:19:53.008 --> 00:19:57.070\nCould be a SSD, that's built\ninto the motherboard as well and\n\n372\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.800\nwhat they do is they take\n\n373\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.175\nthe board that would traditionally\nbe like if this is an external one.\n\n374\n00:20:03.175 --> 00:20:06.475\nJust think about taking that whole PCB and\njust setting it right down,\n\n375\n00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:08.855\nlocking it down to the motherboard itself.\n\n376\n00:20:08.855 --> 00:20:13.475\nAnd again, you get the speeds of\nthe electrical memory storage,\n\n377\n00:20:13.475 --> 00:20:18.050\nif you will, versus the old\ntraditional mechanical memory.\n\n378\n00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.610\nAll right Dan, I know that we've\ngot a lot more to go here bud.\n\n379\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.560\nBut I think we'll take care of\njust a couple more things before\n\n380\n00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.270\nwe maybe cut this one a little short and\ngo into a numero dos.\n\n381\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.940\nI wanna talk real briefly\nabout some ports and adapters.\n\n382\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.080\nThis is another thing that we've\ntalked about in another episode.\n\n383\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.180\nBut context kinda changes on this,\nthe verbiage in the exam objectives.\n\n384\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.630\nAnd what I mean by that is these adapters,\n\n385\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.300\nthat change interfaces from one\nto another type of technology,\n\n386\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.580\nallowing an inte-roperability\nbetween two dissimilar technologies.\n\n387\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.930\nAll right, now, wow,\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n388\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.780\nAll right essentially I've got a USB\nport but I have no wired connection, so\n\n389\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.650\nwhat do I use?\n\n390\n00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.850\nI use one of these connectors right here,\nright, these dongles.\n\n391\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.172\nThis just happens to be a USB\nto an Ethernet adapter, right.\n\n392\n00:21:08.172 --> 00:21:11.788\nSo if I don't have a wired Ethernet\nport we could use Express card but\n\n393\n00:21:11.788 --> 00:21:14.650\nif I don't have an Express card,\nwhat do I do?\n\n394\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.160\nWell, one of the most prevalent and\ncommon connectors in just about almost any\n\n395\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.760\ncomputing device today, whether you're\ntalking about IoT, again, whether you're\n\n396\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.170\ntalking about laptops, desktops,\nit's gonna be your USB interface, right?\n\n397\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.840\nSo your USB interface does\nallow you that capability.\n\n398\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.610\nNow you could see other ones too, right?\n\n399\n00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.820\nYou could see something like\na DisplayPort connector, right?\n\n400\n00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.290\nIt could be Mini DisplayPort\nlike we have right here.\n\n401\n00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.160\nIn fact, let's go ahead and take a look\nat this one so you guys can see it.\n\n402\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.060\nCould be mini display port.\n\n403\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.730\nAll right, now one of the things\nthat's kinda interesting is,\n\n404\n00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.785\nhere let me get that\nagainst the black there.\n\n405\n00:21:47.785 --> 00:21:51.188\nAnd one of the things too, to keep in\nmind is that mini display port and\n\n406\n00:21:51.188 --> 00:21:53.073\nthunderbolt use the same connector.\n\n407\n00:21:53.073 --> 00:21:56.821\nHowever, technically they have\nslight variations in their\n\n408\n00:21:56.821 --> 00:21:58.960\ncommunication protocols.\n\n409\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.150\nBut again, you can hook one of this up but\n\n410\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.430\nthere's no guarantee that you're gonna\nget the full functionality of it.\n\n411\n00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.530\nThe reason I say that, is because\nThunderbolt not only supports video,\n\n412\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.970\nnot only supports audio but\nit also supports networking as well.\n\n413\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.510\nAgain, DisplayPort does now too, but\nagain keep in mind, different versions.\n\n414\n00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.990\nIt is a digital interface.\n\n415\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:26.220\nAnd this just happens to be one that\nis essentially HDMI, DisplayPort HDMI.\n\n416\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.803\nAgain, like I was telling you before,\n\n417\n00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:32.963\nwe also have this one here which\nis your USB, to RJ45 as well.\n\n418\n00:22:32.963 --> 00:22:40.070\nYou could see other ones that are USB to\na wireless type of dongle if you will.\n\n419\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:45.141\nThat'd be your Wi-Fi dongle\nversus your RJ-45 to USB dongle.\n\n420\n00:22:45.141 --> 00:22:49.660\nAnd you could see some too that\nare quite literally a Bluetooth, right.\n\n421\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.400\nIs the fact that I have\na Bluetooth connection and\n\n422\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.430\nwhat it does is it connects to a USB port.\n\n423\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.843\nRight, so\nnow if I don't have a Bluetooth built in,\n\n424\n00:22:58.843 --> 00:23:03.513\nI essentially have a little dongle\nthat you just plug it right into USB.\n\n425\n00:23:03.513 --> 00:23:07.311\nYou install the driver, hopefully plug and\nplay is there, you don't have to install\n\n426\n00:23:07.311 --> 00:23:11.080\na driver and it allows you to pair\nup with Bluetooth based devices.\n\n427\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.720\nOne of the other ones that you\nalso have too, I think I got here.\n\n428\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.671\nAnd this one's become a less\npopular built into your laptops.\n\n429\n00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:21.858\nAnd if we could take a look\nhere with the sky cam,\n\n430\n00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:27.630\nthis is one that they call out and that's\nbecause the lack of optical drives, right?\n\n431\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:32.540\nI don't even know if this has got a driver\nhere we'll try it, it's coming on.\n\n432\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:37.440\nRight, and essentially what this is,\nbasically optical driver, right?\n\n433\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.370\nOptical drive to USB, right, and\nit allows me that if I don't have\n\n434\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.730\nthe optical drive which a lot\nof them don't have anymore,\n\n435\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.850\nit allows me to bring optical drive\nfunctionality to a device like this one.\n\n436\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.560\nLikely these MacBooks that we have\nthat don't have optical drives, right?\n\n437\n00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.613\nSo those are a couple to keep in mind,\n\n438\n00:23:55.613 --> 00:23:58.544\nyou have Thunderbolt again\nyou have display ports.\n\n439\n00:23:58.544 --> 00:24:01.470\nAgain, real common is mini display port.\n\n440\n00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:05.010\nNow mini display port isn't called out\non the exam next to our adapters but\n\n441\n00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.440\nit's so common we wouldn't be doing you\nany justice if we didn't talk about it.\n\n442\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.220\nThunderbolt is there too,\nlooks just like a display port connection.\n\n443\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.970\nUSB to RJ45 dongle is what they\ncall that out the exam, guys.\n\n444\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.086\nLet's simplify it,\nit's USB to wired Ethernet.\n\n445\n00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:23.980\nUSB to WI-fi and again could be,\n\n446\n00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.370\ndoesn't necessarily have to have\nthe dipole antenna, it could just be,\n\n447\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.880\nkind of like we called it,\nlike the little wall wart or something.\n\n448\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.210\nIt could just be an all\ninternal omni-directional\n\n449\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.350\nantenna that's built right\ninto the USB to WiFi dongle.\n\n450\n00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.714\nUSB to Bluetooth, again, just be something\nthat you would plug in and allows\n\n451\n00:24:39.714 --> 00:24:43.258\nyou to connect to do the Bluetooth pairing\nand do the Bluetooth communications.\n\n452\n00:24:43.258 --> 00:24:47.786\nAnd last but not least when it\ncomes to your ports and adapters,\n\n453\n00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:51.637\ndo keep in mind that we have the USB and\noptical drive.\n\n454\n00:24:51.637 --> 00:24:54.980\nThe reason we bring them back in laptops,\nlike I said,\n\n455\n00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.573\nwe have already covered these,\nis because they use the context of dongle.\n\n456\n00:24:59.573 --> 00:25:03.504\nDon't let that confuse you,\ndongle just means it's hanging outside,\n\n457\n00:25:03.504 --> 00:25:07.080\nexternally of the laptop\ndangling around if you will.\n\n458\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.462\nSo really that's the only difference\nwhen it comes to these technologies.\n\n459\n00:25:10.462 --> 00:25:13.554\nHowever, if you have a desktop and\nyou're using these as well,\n\n460\n00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:16.200\nthey're performing the same functionality.\n\n461\n00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, that's a good introduction\nto the different components\n\n462\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.260\nthat we might see\nconnected to our laptops.\n\n463\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.920\nAnd just the hardware in general\nthat's inside of our laptops.\n\n464\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.780\nI know that we have more to conversate\nwhen it comes to that very topic.\n\n465\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.870\nBut we are well out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n466\n00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.910\nAnd as you alluded to,\nwe'll have to go into numero dos.\n\n467\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.661\nSo join us for that.\n\n468\n00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:36.710\nThank you for watching.\n\n469\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.320\nFor this one, signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n470\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:40.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n471\n00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.678\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n472\n00:25:43.678 --> 00:25:49.611\n[MUSIC]\n\n473\n00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:53.444\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.291\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:13.430\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.330\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.640\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.440\nAnd in today's episode it\nis more in our A+ exams,\n\n8\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.740\nso thank you for joining us and\nalso joining us, well,\n\n9\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.060\nit would be a day without him if we didn't\nhave Mr. Wes Bryan on the set with us.\n\n10\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.260\nWes, glad to have you yet again.\n\n11\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.760\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.320\nLooking forward to continuing on in\nour laptop hardware and components.\n\n14\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.185\nWe've been looking at, well,\nour one form of our mobile devices.\n\n15\n00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.535\nI wanna be careful in saying that,\ncuz we do have an additional\n\n16\n00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.625\nepisode that's coming up that it will\ntalk more about things like tablets,\n\n17\n00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.937\nif you will, and smartphones.\n\n18\n00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:50.797\nBut, we're really talking about mobility,\n\n19\n00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:55.057\nright, in the first part of this little\nmini series that we're doing here.\n\n20\n00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:59.607\nWe talked about the major factors\nwhen it comes to laptops, right.\n\n21\n00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:01.637\nRemember that is battery life.\n\n22\n00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:03.397\nThat's one of the things that is very,\nvery important.\n\n23\n00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:06.267\nHow long can we get\nlife out of the battery\n\n24\n00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:09.670\nwithout having to plug in to some\nkind of external power source?\n\n25\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.350\nAs well as proper thermal management.\n\n26\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.730\nRemember that we don't have\na lot of the space that we\n\n27\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.460\nhave inside of things like\nyour desktops and even more so\n\n28\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.340\nyour servers to stuff a whole bunch\nof fans in there if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.180\nThese huge gigantic heat\nsyncs to transfer and\n\n30\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.840\ndissipate the heat away from our hot\ncomponents like our CPU and our memory.\n\n31\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380\nWe also talked a little bit about some\nof the ways that you could expand\n\n32\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.460\nthe functionality, for instance, on your\nExpressCard technologies as well as things\n\n33\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.150\nlike some of the adapters or dongles you\ncould see inside of your laptops too.\n\n34\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.270\nI guess the second part would be on\nthe outside part of your laptop.\n\n35\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.370\nIn this one, what we wanna kinda do is\nwe kinda move into some of the special\n\n36\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.410\nfunctions that we can perform or\nwe can manipulate if\n\n37\n00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.030\nyou will the laptop into performing\nthrough things like your function keys and\n\n38\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.340\nI want you to understand again\ngonna out the gate that we\n\n39\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.940\ndon't have a consistency in this and\nthat's because one of the things that\n\n40\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.730\nis common across all that is consistent\nis that you have function keys right?\n\n41\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.540\nThe function keys whether you can.\n\n42\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.150\nPress them by themselves or you have\nsome kind of keyboard shortcut, right,\n\n43\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.440\nlike the f and then, key if you will\non your motherboard to actually\n\n44\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.980\nuse the function keys is the change pretty\nmuch greatly between laptop to laptop.\n\n45\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.600\nNow, one of the mechanic does stay\nconsistent is the other MacBook, right?\n\n46\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.230\nMacbook is pretty much stayed consistent\nbetween the different Macbooks that they\n\n47\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.360\nhave, on how you're gonna\naccess these function keys.\n\n48\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.030\nAll right, and let's take a look\nat what we're talking about here.\n\n49\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.560\nIf we go to the sky cam here,\n\n50\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.850\nyou'll see that we essentially\nhave our Macbook, right?\n\n51\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.470\nSo, this is an example of a Macbook Pro,\nand a relatively new one.\n\n52\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.620\nConsidering one of the other ones that\nwe're gonna show you here in a bit.\n\n53\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.600\nAnd notice, if we kinda zoom in here,\n\n54\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.240\nyou'll see that we have across\nthe top here, we have our F keys.\n\n55\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.330\nThese are the function keys.\n\n56\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.395\nNow, functional keys also have\nadditional functionality built into it.\n\n57\n00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:15.175\nAnd for instance,\nyou could see things like brightness,\n\n58\n00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:18.655\nwe could go dimmer if we\nuse the function key.\n\n59\n00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:19.537\nWe could go.\n\n60\n00:03:19.537 --> 00:03:24.577\nA little bit brighter if we want but\nfor mac if I want to\n\n61\n00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:29.747\naccess the actual F1 functionality,\nI actually have to ht this key here and\n\n62\n00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:32.617\nthat's why I said sometimes it\ncan be just keyboard shortcut.\n\n63\n00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:37.227\nNow, you also have like for instance in\npc they kinda do the opposite, right?\n\n64\n00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:42.080\nIf you press the F1 key you\nget the F1 functionality, and\n\n65\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.530\nif we want, let's say for\ninstance on a PC, if you wanted to dim it,\n\n66\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.150\nyou would actually press the Function key.\n\n67\n00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.260\nAnd then, whatever the key is across the\ntop to access that special functionality.\n\n68\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.820\n&gt;&gt; One of the few times I\nactually agree with Apple's\n\n69\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.400\nphilosophy here is I don't\ntypically use a lot of F1, F2,\n\n70\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.220\nF3, F4 in my day-to-day\n&gt;&gt; Workings, but I do brighten and\n\n71\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.410\ndim the screen and\n\n72\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.320\ndo the other function stuff that I would\nnormally have to hit a function key with.\n\n73\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.970\nOn the Mac, I don't have to.\n\n74\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:11.920\n&gt;&gt; And I agree with you, Dan.\n\n75\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.570\nThe only time I've really\nhad to use the function,\n\n76\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.230\nthe F1 key, is in the ZoomIt\nutility that we use inside a PC.\n\n77\n00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.790\nIt's the only time I've ever\nactually used Or F5 to refresh,\n\n78\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.310\nthat's about the only one.\n\n79\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.940\nSo Mac, if you could help us out there,\n\n80\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.685\nput a red key somewhere on the keyboard\nwhere we can refresh our webpage.\n\n81\n00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:35.230\n[LAUGH] Other than that that's really the\nonly time, in PC, that I really used it.\n\n82\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.770\nThat's some of the functionality.\n\n83\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.640\nNow, there are other ones Just here too,\nthat we'll kinda talk about too.\n\n84\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.540\nYou have things like, for instance you\ncan see things like volume, right?\n\n85\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.760\nYou can see, for\ninstance we have speaker volume, and\n\n86\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.040\nthat is something,\nvolume settings up and down.\n\n87\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.940\nWhether you want to get a little bit\nlouder, get a little bit quieter.\n\n88\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.870\nIn some of them, they do have\nthe ability across the function keys\n\n89\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.520\nto actually turn the touch pad on and off.\n\n90\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.970\nA lot of times this is a setting\njust because if you do what I do,\n\n91\n00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.580\nand you can't type to save your life,\nyou fat finger the keyboard,\n\n92\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.730\nyou can turn the touch pad off and\nthat can be problematic.\n\n93\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.680\nSo a lot of times especially in things\nlike Windows operating systems.\n\n94\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.640\nThat'll be something that's set\ninside of the mouse options.\n\n95\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.470\nIn the operating system or even more so,\nlike for instance if you have an intel\n\n96\n00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.760\nplatform where intel has their\nown third party software.\n\n97\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.780\nThey can do all of the extended\nfunctionality of the touchpad too.\n\n98\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.810\nNow, you will see sometimes that in here,\nyou'll have things like you'll\n\n99\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.420\nsee look like a little cell tower and that\ncell tower could be a couple of things.\n\n100\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.330\nIt could actually mean that there's a cell\ncard that turns cellular on and off or\n\n101\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.560\nit could be a Wi-Fi which you could\nturn our WiFi adapter on or off.\n\n102\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.170\nNow, you can see that we don't have\nthis ability Inside of the Mac here,\n\n103\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.310\nMac has right there on the top of their\nscreen got a little setting that you could\n\n104\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.570\njust right click and you can turn your\nwireless on and off there as well.\n\n105\n00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.490\nWe talked a little bit about screen\nbrightness, Bluetooth is another one here,\n\n106\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.040\nnow I will tell you that bluetooth\nis becoming less popular for\n\n107\n00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.710\nturning on and\noff because on the function key.\n\n108\n00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.260\nAnd here's why.\n\n109\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.270\nRemember that we said the battery life\nwas very very important when it comes to\n\n110\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.260\na laptop or any mobile device for\nthat matter.\n\n111\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.080\nWell, one of the great things about\nbluetooth as its matured over the years is\n\n112\n00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.350\nthat today's bluetooth 4.0 and\nbeyond, we're seeing are low powered.\n\n113\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.120\nWhich means that the device\nitself will probably not out last\n\n114\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.970\nthe battery if you will that powers\nbluetooth, it's a very low power,\n\n115\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.670\nit's not as power hungry as it was\nin the previous generations and\n\n116\n00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.610\nthat's because when you go through\nthe pairing process inside of bluetooth.\n\n117\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.140\nAnd that's where the two devices right\nwhether you have to enter some kind of\n\n118\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.170\npin or something they form this\nsecurity this trust relationship and\n\n119\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.330\nthey start communicating\nbetween one another.\n\n120\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.760\nWell, in past revisions of the Bluetooth\nspecification, even though you didn't have\n\n121\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.750\nto manually do that,\nlike you do the first time you set it up.\n\n122\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.680\nIn the background underneath,\nif you open up the hood and\n\n123\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.690\nlook at the engine,\nit was still repairing.\n\n124\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.040\nAnd I don't mean repairing as in fixing,\nit would go through the repairing process\n\n125\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.730\nin the background constantly, and\nwhat it would be doing is generating\n\n126\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.400\nnew session keys and stuff like that for\nsecurity purposes right?\n\n127\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.860\nMaking sure that it was\nconstantly updated.\n\n128\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.230\nAnd that's a good thing right because we\ndon't want somebody right we talk about in\n\n129\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.660\nother security episodes right.\n\n130\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.410\nYou want something to be ephemeral.\n\n131\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.590\nYou don't want it to be real\nstatic when it comes to security.\n\n132\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.970\nBecause let's say Dan's computer\nhas a static communication.\n\n133\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.280\nAnd I'm out there on the network and\n\n134\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.710\nI've got a piece of software that\ncan actually see that information.\n\n135\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.300\nWell, if it's static and it never changes,\nI got a lot of time in the world to grab\n\n136\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.100\nsome of that information and I can pass it\noff to Dan's computer as though I'm him.\n\n137\n00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.900\nAnd now, I've taken him out of the mix and\nthere's some kind of security loophole.\n\n138\n00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.540\nSo beneficial for security, right?\n\n139\n00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.732\nNot so beneficial for your battery,\nbecause that extra process,\n\n140\n00:07:57.732 --> 00:08:00.870\nthat extra communication would\ntake some of your battery power.\n\n141\n00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.531\nNow I know I'm rambling\na little bit here on Bluetooth.\n\n142\n00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:06.731\nBut Bluetooth is a very low\npowered communication day,\n\n143\n00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.810\nunlike it has been in the past.\n\n144\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.238\nProbably one of the reasons\nyou don't see a lot of the on,\n\n145\n00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:16.190\noff Bluetooth physically on\nthe keyboards today versus you do\n\n146\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.320\nhave the settings inside\nof your operating system.\n\n147\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.050\nAll right, the other thing too,\nhere that we have to look at,\n\n148\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.510\nyou'll see on this\na MacBook here definitely.\n\n149\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.240\nScreen orientation, right portrait,\nlandscape sometimes you have that,\n\n150\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.750\nsometimes you don't have that,\nit really depends on the device itself.\n\n151\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.890\nYou also have things like, for\ninstance, media options, right?\n\n152\n00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.630\nAnd we can see the media\noptions right here, right?\n\n153\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.418\nFast forward, rewind, play and pause.\n\n154\n00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:44.353\nWhich is kind of interesting today,\nbecause you don't really see\n\n155\n00:08:44.353 --> 00:08:48.426\na lot of these hard buttons like you\nused to in the old days like, wow,\n\n156\n00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:53.370\nI'm really gonna age myself here back on\ncassette tapes, CDs and stuff like that.\n\n157\n00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.871\nBecause well we have built\nin media players today.\n\n158\n00:08:56.871 --> 00:09:01.159\nBut you still could have and could see and\na lot of times do these hard buttons.\n\n159\n00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:05.179\nThe other thing that you can have on these\ndevices too sometimes denoted by a little\n\n160\n00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:08.278\nairplane symbol is something\nknown as airplane mode, right.\n\n161\n00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:12.888\nWhen you're taking off, right, taxiing the\nrunway they'll tell you time to turn all\n\n162\n00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:16.487\nradio, devices off, which I've\nkind of always thought is funny,\n\n163\n00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:21.226\nis that my little potential $400 laptop\ncould potentially disrupt a multi-million\n\n164\n00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:23.930\ndollar aircraft aviation system,\nso go figure.\n\n165\n00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.291\nBut, you could go into play mode and\nit turns off all the radios and\n\n166\n00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:31.512\nagain the theory behind the joking is\nthat, it shouldn't interfere with any kind\n\n167\n00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:34.108\nof communications that\nare going on on the plane.\n\n168\n00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:37.902\nHowever, you'll see that a lot in these\ncommunications are going over fiber optic\n\n169\n00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:41.220\ncommunications anyways to alleviate\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n170\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.990\nSo, just a little side note and\nrant there but fun nonetheless.\n\n171\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.620\nOne of the last things I'll talk about\nwhen it comes to some of the special\n\n172\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.880\nfunction keys that we\nhave here too Is GPS.\n\n173\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.530\nAnd I don't have a button for this one\nhere, but again, the ability to turn off\n\n174\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:02.070\nthe Global Positioning System within\nthe device itself that really depends on,\n\n175\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.630\nand a lot of these depend\non the device you have.\n\n176\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:10.870\nThere is no one size fits all PC is\na hodgepodge of different manufacturers,\n\n177\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.770\ndifferent possible arrangements and\nconfigurations about the only consistency.\n\n178\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.299\nAnd I'm not saying hey,\nMac is better than PC.\n\n179\n00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:19.530\nThey all have their place in the world.\n\n180\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.970\nThey all have goods and bads, but really\nwhen it comes down, and I'm a Windows guy.\n\n181\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.240\nI'm a PC guy.\n\n182\n00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.420\nBut when it comes down to it, about the\nonly one I've seen that really does have\n\n183\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.850\nconsistency is the Mac world, right.\n\n184\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.524\nYou can see that for the most part over\nthe years they kept that same arrangement.\n\n185\n00:10:31.524 --> 00:10:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've got that\nreally cool LED one now, right?\n\n186\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.274\nIt kinda lights up of\nhaving a physical button.\n\n187\n00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:41.801\nYou do touch it,\nit's basically just a small LCD or\n\n188\n00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:45.795\nLED a bar across the newer MacBook,\nit's very cool.\n\n189\n00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:50.755\n&gt;&gt; It really is and some people like and\nsome people are resistant\n\n190\n00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:54.305\nto change like I need a tactile interface,\nwell you've got touchscreens right?\n\n191\n00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:59.255\nTactile might be going away\nhere in the next few years and\n\n192\n00:10:59.255 --> 00:11:02.645\nI'm not claiming that we only need 64K of\nRAM and that's all we'll ever need but\n\n193\n00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:06.930\nwhat I am saying is that, some people, for\nthem, they might like a tactile interface.\n\n194\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.170\nAnd really,\nI'm glad you kinda mentioned that Dan too.\n\n195\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.580\nCuz if you're a technician, right,\nyou're not technically a sales person.\n\n196\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.980\nPlease don't try to be that sales\nperson unless your helping you end user\n\n197\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.630\nout because that just comes\ndown to ethics right?\n\n198\n00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:26.730\nIs that you might do exactly that, you\nmight ask somebody are you one of these\n\n199\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.980\npeople that needs a tactile type button, a\nbutton that you can feel and press right?\n\n200\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.835\nWell maybe you need the function keys.\n\n201\n00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:36.452\nHowever, if you're like us we're\ngeeks it doesn't have to be tactile,\n\n202\n00:11:36.452 --> 00:11:40.080\nit can be touch interface\njust because it's cool.\n\n203\n00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.360\nWell, then, the newer MacBooks that\nhave that, absolutely, that's great.\n\n204\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.190\nI know our CEO here, he is on the\nforefront of anything Mac that comes out,\n\n205\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.080\nhe's gotta have.\n\n206\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.190\n&gt;&gt; He's a total fanboy.\n\n207\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n208\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:52.942\nHe's gotta have it.\n\n209\n00:11:52.942 --> 00:11:53.576\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He sold out hard for them, big time.\n\n210\n00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:55.535\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He definitely, and in fact,\n\n211\n00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:57.400\nhe got one of these the moment\nthey came out right?\n\n212\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n213\n00:11:57.985 --> 00:12:01.743\nhis whole thing that he was happy about\nwas, and I'm going to date myself on this\n\n214\n00:12:01.743 --> 00:12:05.390\none, is the fact that it could do\nthe little Nightrider front screen.\n\n215\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.000\nSo basically paying an extra thousand\ndollars for a laptop just so you could\n\n216\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.280\nhave a Nightrider red LED going back-\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna pass on that [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\n\n218\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.380\nagain that just always begs the question,\n\n219\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.420\nwhich one is going to be more\nconvenient when it comes to repairing.\n\n220\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.457\nWell there is no right answer or\nwrong answer on that one, right.\n\n221\n00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:23.600\nLet me tell you both sides\nof the story here, right.\n\n222\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.550\nIf I've got a tactile interface,\nthose can damage, those are susceptible\n\n223\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.520\nto component corruption,\nany kind of corrosion that gets in there.\n\n224\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.804\nDon't do what I've done in the past and\ndecide that you're laptop's thirsty and\n\n225\n00:12:35.804 --> 00:12:37.623\ngive it a drink, right, starts to corrode.\n\n226\n00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:40.697\nBut on the other side of it is\nthe fact that well, you know what,\n\n227\n00:12:40.697 --> 00:12:44.704\nyou also have logic that's built into the\nLCD or the touch interface ones as well.\n\n228\n00:12:44.704 --> 00:12:47.246\nAnd they use things like digitizers, or\n\n229\n00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:50.612\ncould you something like\na digitizer that actually or\n\n230\n00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:55.801\na composite touch could be resistive touch\nand those interfaces can go wrong too.\n\n231\n00:12:55.801 --> 00:13:01.657\nSo while they're is the lack of a tactile\ntouch right, don't think that there\n\n232\n00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:07.860\nisn't some kind of mechanism in there\nthat could get corrupted or corroded.\n\n233\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.960\nAnd then you add onto the fact\nthat those boards also\n\n234\n00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.660\nuse additional drivers and logic.\n\n235\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.310\nSo now you've got a couple of extra things\nthat are going along with it as well.\n\n236\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.090\nSo just like computing in any\ncomputing device we've talked about,\n\n237\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.740\nthere's pros and cons,\nthere's goods and bads.\n\n238\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.330\nKeep in mind what the necessities\nof the customer is, right?\n\n239\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.650\nAnd remember that you have to keep your\nonce essentially out of it, right?\n\n240\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.270\nBecause what you want,\nmight not be what the customer wants.\n\n241\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.530\nDan and I while we agree on\na very many things in computing,\n\n242\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.610\nthere's things that we\nare polar opposites on, right?\n\n243\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.880\nAnd that comes from each\nof our personal experience.\n\n244\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.705\nIt doesn't mean one's\nright over the other.\n\n245\n00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:48.420\nIt's called personal computing for\na reason.\n\n246\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.130\nAnd what's personal when it comes\nto your computing environment,\n\n247\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.754\nwhether it comes to your likes\nmight not be what the customer end.\n\n248\n00:13:53.754 --> 00:13:57.918\nSo just listen to your customers right,\nand one of the best benefits that you can\n\n249\n00:13:57.918 --> 00:14:01.896\ndo is if you're supporting anybody and\nthe help does, first of all listen,\n\n250\n00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:06.025\nI know I have a problem with this one and\ndon't ask my wife cuz she will tell you.\n\n251\n00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:09.370\nWe have to learn to close our mouths and\nlisten with our ears, right?\n\n252\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.530\nSo listen to what the customers wants are,\n\n253\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.390\nunderstand what\nthe customers wants are and\n\n254\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.230\nthen when it comes down to it, just give\nthem options based on your experience.\n\n255\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.990\nYou can say well this is why I don't or\nthis is why I do.\n\n256\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.230\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were going to say\ntell them why they're wrong and\n\n257\n00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.360\ntell them what should happen.\n\n258\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.710\n&gt;&gt; That's right we'll go Nick Burns\non them and say just step away from.\n\n259\n00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.602\n&gt;&gt; From the that's not right.\n\n260\n00:14:26.602 --> 00:14:27.297\nYou should do this.\n\n261\n00:14:27.297 --> 00:14:28.914\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And Dan, I was gonna say and\n\n262\n00:14:28.914 --> 00:14:30.722\nDan is completely kidding on\nthat one right, but seriously.\n\n263\n00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:31.507\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n264\n00:14:31.507 --> 00:14:34.376\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So when it comes\nto functions keys again guys,\n\n265\n00:14:34.376 --> 00:14:37.350\nthose are some of the ones\nthat you can see on the exam.\n\n266\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.270\nAnd some of the ones that you wanna\nunderstand that do exist and what they do.\n\n267\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.500\nThere is one that I will mention.\n\n268\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.852\nAnd a lot of times this is a functionality\nof the network adapter that's built in.\n\n269\n00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:52.710\nYou'll see when we go into it,\nif you're looking at the objectives and\n\n270\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.661\nfollowing along, it's very first one\non the list you might say well Wes,\n\n271\n00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.253\nwhy'd you skip over that one, right?\n\n272\n00:14:57.253 --> 00:15:00.280\nAnd that's called dual displays,\nanytime we talk about dual monitors.\n\n273\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.774\nAnd the reason I say this is because\nin the earlier days of laptops,\n\n274\n00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:09.267\nyou could have a hard coded function\nkey that would allow you to push\n\n275\n00:15:09.267 --> 00:15:13.696\nthe display adapters what it's\ndisplaying to a second monitor.\n\n276\n00:15:13.696 --> 00:15:16.831\nAnd what I mean by that until\nthat button was pushed,\n\n277\n00:15:16.831 --> 00:15:20.835\nyou didn't get dual displays right,\nyou could toggle on and off.\n\n278\n00:15:20.835 --> 00:15:26.737\nHowever, with the smart or the logic\nthat's built into these graphic adapters,\n\n279\n00:15:26.737 --> 00:15:32.378\nthe way they've come so far, we've got\ndocking stations that we hook up to and\n\n280\n00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:35.303\ninstantly it spread driver installed.\n\n281\n00:15:35.303 --> 00:15:39.605\nLet me preference this way,\ndriver installation first, right.\n\n282\n00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.295\nIt spreads it right across\nall three monitors.\n\n283\n00:15:42.295 --> 00:15:45.278\nAnd then what you need to make up\nthe decision is how do I want those\n\n284\n00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.227\narranged, right?\n\n285\n00:15:46.227 --> 00:15:50.098\nAnd that's necessarily gonna be something\nthat could be done on the function\n\n286\n00:15:50.098 --> 00:15:50.761\nkey itself.\n\n287\n00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:53.750\nA lot of times, that's gonna be\nset within the operating system.\n\n288\n00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.242\nSo in Mac, we go to System Preferences,\ngo to Display Option, if you will.\n\n289\n00:15:57.242 --> 00:15:59.910\nAnd then there's an arrangement,\nthere's color and arrangement.\n\n290\n00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.950\nAnd we basically move\nthem where we need to.\n\n291\n00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.343\nHowever, if you're inside of a Windows\nbased PC, it could be as simple as right\n\n292\n00:16:07.343 --> 00:16:10.700\nclicking on the desktop and\nchoosing screen resolution.\n\n293\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.210\nAnd then when you pull up the screen\nresolution, that you'll see when we get\n\n294\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.470\ninto our operating system,\nyou arrange the monitors that way.\n\n295\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.970\nBut notice that that necessarily isn't\na hard coded tactile function key on\n\n296\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.260\nthe motherboard today, versus a setting\nlogically inside of the operating system.\n\n297\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.850\nAnd it is strictly contingent on\nthe network, not the network adapter but\n\n298\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.210\nthe video adapter's capabilities.\n\n299\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.360\nMost of them today\nare capable of doing that.\n\n300\n00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.870\nEven on your tablets for that matter.\n\n301\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.090\nCuz a lot of your tablets are using small,\nsmall, ultra small form factors of\n\n302\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:46.735\nthe same type of graphics cards that we\nsee built into expansion cards, all right.\n\n303\n00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:52.110\nSo, I think we've kinda run\nthat horse to exhaustion there.\n\n304\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.601\nUnderstand the different\nfunctions that you can have,\n\n305\n00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:57.047\nagain there's no consistency\nof them inside of them.\n\n306\n00:16:57.047 --> 00:17:02.018\nAnd it really depends on what the\nnecessity is of the user that you might be\n\n307\n00:17:02.018 --> 00:17:04.540\nsupporting, or users.\n\n308\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.090\nNow the next thing we get into is a,\n\n309\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:10.190\nit can be a confusing topic if\nyou've never seen it before.\n\n310\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.410\nAll right, what I'm talking\nabout is a docking station.\n\n311\n00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.130\nAnd the reason I say that it can be\nconfusing is because there's two different\n\n312\n00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.130\ntypes of docking stations, right?\n\n313\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.770\nThere's what's known as\na docking station and\n\n314\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.460\nthere's what's known as a port replicator.\n\n315\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.320\nThe interesting thing is,\nwhat I like about it,\n\n316\n00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.010\nis they've taken the term port replicator\noff of the exam objectives, right?\n\n317\n00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.900\nAnd I like that because you know\nwhat a docking station is called,\n\n318\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.440\nsometimes advanced port replicator,\nall right?\n\n319\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.220\nAnd either way you look at it, for the\nmost part they're doing the same thing.\n\n320\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.370\nHowever, one has the functionality\nmore like a USB hub\n\n321\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:48.450\nversus one that is a platform that quite\nliterally you clip the laptop into.\n\n322\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:52.950\nLet me show you what I mean, I've actually\ngot one pulled up here on my screen here.\n\n323\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.660\nThis is one kinda like, our facilities\nmanager here, is the guy behind the scenes\n\n324\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.070\nthat a lot of times doesn't get a credit\nfor some of the videos that you watch, Mr.\n\n325\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.410\nNate Koplan, and I believe this is\none of the types that he has, right.\n\n326\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.960\nThis is for the Lenovo ThinkPads or\n\n327\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.490\nLenovo Dan's our English master over\nhere I don't know how that's pronounced.\n\n328\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.270\n&gt;&gt; I've always heard it Lenovo.\n\n329\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.719\n&gt;&gt; Lenovo, okay, we'll go with that\nI'll trust your word on that one.\n\n330\n00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:19.625\nAll right and let me go ahead and click\non this and we can kinda see here, and\n\n331\n00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:23.635\nagain guys, you can see the price on\nthere so let's give credit to Newegg.\n\n332\n00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:26.410\nRight, a 164 bucks here guys,\ncuz this is all their.\n\n333\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.360\nI love their interface here,\nyou can kinda really look at what it is.\n\n334\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.190\nFirst of all, let's kinda zoom in.\n\n335\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.480\nWhat's you end up having in\na docking station is this,\n\n336\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.650\nI guess that's all I can do here,\nwe can go a little bit farther.\n\n337\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.730\nYou have this little clip, all right?\n\n338\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.400\nNow, let me also say\nabout docking stations.\n\n339\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.230\nThey are Uber proprietary.\n\n340\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.655\nAnd what I mean about proprietary is\nremember we talked about standardization,\n\n341\n00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:51.770\nespecially in our networking section\nas a way to give interoperability to\n\n342\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.670\nbetween the similar protocols and\nwe don't get vendor locked.\n\n343\n00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.560\nSorry guys,\nyou don't get the option here, right.\n\n344\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.745\nAnd that's another thing that I\nmight say about port replicators.\n\n345\n00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:00.050\nSometimes port replicators and\n\n346\n00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.750\nUSB external hubs make it\nswitch between stations.\n\n347\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.363\nIn fact,\n\n348\n00:19:03.363 --> 00:19:08.214\nthe ones that we use here at at ITProTV\nwill also hook up to a PC as well as Mac.\n\n349\n00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:11.510\nAnd that's the benefit versus\na docking station like this.\n\n350\n00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.070\nI have to have that exact clip.\n\n351\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.505\nI I have to have a Lenovo ThinkPad, right.\n\n352\n00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:19.685\nI can't take a MacBook and,\nthat's pretty consistent with Mac cuz\n\n353\n00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:23.025\nthey're really proprietory\nabout their hardware designs.\n\n354\n00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:27.561\nBut I couldn't take one of this Dell PCs,\nright, or PC-based laptops [SOUND] and\n\n355\n00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:28.704\nlock it in, right?\n\n356\n00:19:28.704 --> 00:19:33.280\nSo that is something that I kinda want\nyou guys, ladies and gentlemen to know\n\n357\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.655\nout there is that docking stations\nare very, very proprietary.\n\n358\n00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:42.400\nNow this is kinda cool, I like this too,\nbecause well with the docking station,\n\n359\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.370\nthis one actually has thumb print right?\n\n360\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.140\nSo we have biometrics\nrecognition on one side of this.\n\n361\n00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.880\nI believe we've got a power button.\n\n362\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.610\nAnd I know Nate's has this one too.\n\n363\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.210\nAnd I might be a little\nbit wrong on that one.\n\n364\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.399\nLet me look here.\n\n365\n00:19:56.399 --> 00:19:57.740\n&gt;&gt; I think it might be the eject button.\n\n366\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.460\n&gt;&gt; It might, yes absolutely yeah.\n\n367\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.390\nYep, it might be and I don't see it here.\n\n368\n00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.050\nBut okay yeah, you're probably\nabsolutely right there on that Dan.\n\n369\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.889\nAgain, keep in mind that\nthe functionality and\n\n370\n00:20:09.889 --> 00:20:12.658\nfeatures that they have is really kind of,\noops.\n\n371\n00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:15.670\nLet me go ahead and get out of here.\n\n372\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:24.040\nThis one doesn't have the setting\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n373\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.070\nTry that again.\n\n374\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.630\nThere we go.\n\n375\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.980\nThat's what I want.\n\n376\n00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:33.380\nAll right, so you can kind of see that we\nhave the different functionality feature.\n\n377\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.960\nNow, I was wanting to and\nif I can find it here, there we go.\n\n378\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.945\nI wanna spin this around, all right.\n\n379\n00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:43.600\nLet's go ahead cuz I wanna\nshow you the backside of this.\n\n380\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.840\nIf you don't see the backside then\n\n381\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.430\nyou kinda don't-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n382\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.060\n&gt;&gt; really understand what\nthe heck is this thing doing?\n\n383\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.790\nDid you just give me nice steady\nplatform to put my laptop on?\n\n384\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.372\nDoes it even have a base\nto begin with [LAUGH]?\n\n385\n00:20:53.372 --> 00:20:56.060\nAnd this is really what\nwe want you guys to know.\n\n386\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.842\nNotice that we have all these\nadditional ports back here.\n\n387\n00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:04.442\nAnd this one is really cool cuz it\nsupports all the way back to VGA so very,\n\n388\n00:21:04.442 --> 00:21:05.040\nvery good.\n\n389\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.506\nAnd this is great, right, maybe you have\nan external monitor that you wanna use or\n\n390\n00:21:09.506 --> 00:21:13.585\nyour company wants to use but they are not\ngoing out and doing display port or\n\n391\n00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:15.160\nHDMI for that fact, right?\n\n392\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.010\nBecause we in our home environments,\nright?\n\n393\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.770\nWe like to, I mean let's face it,\nwe like to have new stuff right?\n\n394\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.659\nI don't know about you Dan but\nI like high definition videos.\n\n395\n00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:27.140\nSo I probably wouldn't want\nsomething like VGA anymore.\n\n396\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.613\n&gt;&gt; I like the lowest definition\nI can possibly have.\n\n397\n00:21:28.613 --> 00:21:32.965\n&gt;&gt; Right, so Dan lives in the 80s,\nthe 80s were great, right?\n\n398\n00:21:32.965 --> 00:21:35.370\nBut joking aside,\nin our home environments,\n\n399\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.450\nwe like to have the latest and greatest.\n\n400\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.660\nHowever, in a company, the company is\ngoing to get some kind of three to five\n\n401\n00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:47.170\nyear, run of the life span of\nwhatever their device might be,\n\n402\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.730\nand you might still see that it's VGA or\nDVI in this matter, right?\n\n403\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.530\nSo, or for that matter, I mean.\n\n404\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.950\nBut you can also see that they can do,\nthey can go a little bit further, and we\n\n405\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.806\ncan have things like, well actually those\nare almost like SATA ports there too, so.\n\n406\n00:22:00.806 --> 00:22:02.210\nIt could be display for SATA.\n\n407\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.130\nI can't really tell from this point\nbecause it's got a dual blade here so\n\n408\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.110\nthat's got me a little confused.\n\n409\n00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.270\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of surrounding\nthat HDMI port which is.\n\n410\n00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.874\n&gt;&gt; And it really is.\n\n411\n00:22:09.874 --> 00:22:10.718\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's throwing me off.\n\n412\n00:22:10.718 --> 00:22:13.153\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you got HDMI as well.\n\n413\n00:22:13.153 --> 00:22:16.275\nAnd remember, one of the things that we\ntalked about in the first part, right?\n\n414\n00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:19.935\nWe talked about not having an Ethernet\nadapter and having to use a dongle.\n\n415\n00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:21.455\nDocking station I don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n416\n00:22:21.455 --> 00:22:25.115\nClick it down, plug a wired connection\ninto it, now I have connectivity.\n\n417\n00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:28.992\nNow you can also see, and we can run just,\ngonna do a couple of these, right?\n\n418\n00:22:28.992 --> 00:22:32.368\nWell you can see that we have\nthe older USB 2.0 ports, right?\n\n419\n00:22:32.368 --> 00:22:37.810\nAnd then the blue blades, remember blue\nblades, blue does make it better, right?\n\n420\n00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.880\nNot necessarily, but\nit's a joke around here at ITProTV.\n\n421\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.983\nBlue is the USB 3.0.\n\n422\n00:22:42.983 --> 00:22:46.257\nSo notice that we're getting a lot of\n\n423\n00:22:46.257 --> 00:22:51.630\nextended functionality by\nusing one of these devices.\n\n424\n00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.210\nNow I wanna make mention of\nthis little thing right here,\n\n425\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.536\ncuz they also call that out on the exam,\nall right.\n\n426\n00:22:56.536 --> 00:22:58.570\nThis is a physical lock, all right?\n\n427\n00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.280\nThey talked about cable locks, they've\ntalked about a couple different times.\n\n428\n00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.160\nThey talked about physical laptop lock,\nand they talked about cable lock.\n\n429\n00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.130\nThis would fall probably under\nthe physical laptop lock.\n\n430\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:13.270\nAnd it's exactly what\nyou're probably thinking.\n\n431\n00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.770\nAll right, laptops were mobile, right?\n\n432\n00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.060\nWhat does that mean?\n\n433\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.970\nWell, if I have a desktop\nsitting at my desk and\n\n434\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.690\nit has like ten drives in it,\nmaybe it's a high-end rendering station.\n\n435\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.130\nIt's gonna be pretty heavy, right?\n\n436\n00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.660\nNow for somebody like Dan you could\nput this thing over your shoulder,\n\n437\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.190\nyou could fly away there'll be no problem.\n\n438\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:35.110\nBut for somebody like Wes, I'll be\nstruggling to get that thing out the door.\n\n439\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.143\nLaptops not so, right.\n\n440\n00:23:36.143 --> 00:23:40.889\nLaptops because of their mobility,\ntheir portability I guess I should say,\n\n441\n00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:42.990\nthey're easy to steal.\n\n442\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.708\nAll right, so if you have one of these,\n\n443\n00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:47.157\nif we could bring that picture\nback up there real quick,\n\n444\n00:23:47.157 --> 00:23:50.670\nif you have one of these and you have\na physical lock, yeah lock and key, right.\n\n445\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.430\nNow what you have, is you have all these\ndifferent cables that are connected and\n\n446\n00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.070\nthese type of docking stations\ncould be mounted to the desk.\n\n447\n00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.252\nWhich means if you walk over, you're gonna\nhave to break something and in the end if\n\n448\n00:24:03.252 --> 00:24:07.100\nyou're a thief you're only looking for\nthe data, that might be feasible.\n\n449\n00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.160\nBut, if you want to resell this\nthing on the black market,\n\n450\n00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160\nit's not gonna be feasible.\n\n451\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.850\nSo, that's the physical lock.\n\n452\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.880\nBut, I do want you to understand too that\nthere are other types of locks out there\n\n453\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.180\nlike they talk about a cable lock and\nthis is a common one This is,\n\n454\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.340\nwho are we giving credit to,\nthis is Staples, all right.\n\n455\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.380\nI would just like to give people credit\nfor the pictures that they have up here,\n\n456\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.100\nbecause we use them, we're not really\nmaking any money off of these, but\n\n457\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.960\nit might be somebody you wanna go to,\nokay?\n\n458\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.480\nAnd if you notice like an old\nCoca Cola lock key there right.\n\n459\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the barrel keys.\n\n460\n00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:40.900\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it yes sir.\n\n461\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.580\nAnd what this does is this'll\nhave a little lock and\n\n462\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.250\nyou'll see this coming up cuz one of\nthe laptops I'm gonna show you when we\n\n463\n00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.305\nactually get into In two and\nbreak it apart there.\n\n464\n00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:51.595\nIt's an older one and\nit has one of these locks.\n\n465\n00:24:51.595 --> 00:24:55.625\nAnd what I'm really focused in on\nis that little physical latch.\n\n466\n00:24:55.625 --> 00:24:56.995\nIt's a little metal blade, and\n\n467\n00:24:56.995 --> 00:25:01.870\nwhat you do is you put that metal\nblade into the side of the laptop.\n\n468\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.690\nUse a little Coca cola ring\nlock like they've mentioned and\n\n469\n00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.160\nyou lock it in place and it spins it, and\n\n470\n00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.730\nbasically to get this laptop off of that\nlock, you have to rip it right out, right?\n\n471\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.840\nAnd then, what happens is that this cable\n\n472\n00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.080\nphysically fastens itself to\nsome portion of the desk, right?\n\n473\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.480\nSo those are there.\n\n474\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.690\nThey don't mention this in\nthis set of objectives.\n\n475\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.850\nBut, Dan I wanna take a second,\ncuz we've talked about it before and\n\n476\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.940\nmention Low Jack all right.\n\n477\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.400\nLow Jack is another-- if we're\ntalking about keeping laptops safe.\n\n478\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.790\nAll right, now I don't have anything for\nLoJack to show you guys, so\n\n479\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.150\njust take my word, research on it.\n\n480\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.160\nThis is something that's\nbuilt into the firmware, and\n\n481\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.100\nit can work in combination with your GPS\nsystem and communicating with a third\n\n482\n00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.540\nparty that monitors where\nthe heck is that laptop, right?\n\n483\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.815\nAnd I'm aging myself here, where in\nthe world is Carmen Santiago, right?\n\n484\n00:25:55.815 --> 00:26:00.140\n[LAUGH] Because they can track it and\nthey can track it through GPS systems.\n\n485\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.200\nSo that is another technology that, well,\n\n486\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.800\nnot only exam objectives here,\nit is in your A+ exam objectives and\n\n487\n00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.420\nI really think it should be something that\nshould be brought into the laptop section,\n\n488\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.940\ncuz it also works not only in laptops but\nalso mobile devices.\n\n489\n00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.210\nAll right, now there are other\n\n490\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.400\ntypes of screens that we have out there\nthat I just wanna briefly mention.\n\n491\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:29.390\nWith the fact that we want a lot of\nportability you will have some laptops\n\n492\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.769\nout there that will double as tablets, and\nwhat they will have is removable screens.\n\n493\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.520\nThe extend of which those are popular,\n\n494\n00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.700\nreally depends on what you're talking\nabout, cuz then we start blurring a line,\n\n495\n00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.250\nis that a tablet, is it a laptop,\nis it an Ultra Book?\n\n496\n00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.280\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and just mention\nthem in the context of laptops, but\n\n497\n00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.170\nunderstand they could also fall\ninto mobile devices as well.\n\n498\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.260\nIs the fact that you have one of these\nkeyboard based docking stations.\n\n499\n00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.450\nWhich you quite literally clip\nyour laptop or your tablet to, and\n\n500\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.980\nit becomes a full blown type PC.\n\n501\n00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.710\nYou can see this in things\nlike your Surface devices.\n\n502\n00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.440\nThe Surface tablets that\nMicrosoft has out there.\n\n503\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.100\nAnd again, that's a tablet right but\nat the same time it could be considered\n\n504\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:16.160\na small miniature laptop and the fact\nthat it does allow you I guess you\n\n505\n00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.440\ncan't really remove the screen, but\nyou have those out there as well.\n\n506\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.540\nYou might get them call like three in\nones or two in ones base devices too.\n\n507\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.220\nFor a while this was popular and\nbecause of tablets too,\n\n508\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:37.420\nthey also have rotating screens, again,\ndue to the commonality of tablets today,\n\n509\n00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.440\nthe screens itself are rotated\nbased on the screen orientation.\n\n510\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.750\nHowever, in the earlier days you even,\n\n511\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.510\nLevono Would have these screens\nthat basically you'd open it up,\n\n512\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.130\nyou'd turn the whole thing around and\nyou'd fold it back down.\n\n513\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.800\nAnd essentially, you'd use a digitizer and\nyou would work with it like a stylus, and\n\n514\n00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.170\nit was major laptop like a tablet.\n\n515\n00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.520\nAgain, because we have these\ntwo-in-ones where you can\n\n516\n00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.290\npull the tablet right out of it,\nor tablets in general.\n\n517\n00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.840\nYou're kinda seeing those\nbecoming a thing of the past.\n\n518\n00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.890\nBut essentially, that was nothing\nmore than the laptop opening up.\n\n519\n00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:17.030\nYour display would swivel around 180\ndegrees then you could fold it back down.\n\n520\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.640\nAnd now, you could use a digitizer.\n\n521\n00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.480\nA digitizer guys is a little\nbit different than a stylus.\n\n522\n00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.740\nAnd this is in the exam objectives here.\n\n523\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.310\nA stylus is nothing more than\nsome kind of magnetic pen or\n\n524\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.340\neven a plastic pen all right?\n\n525\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.930\nA digitizer is different because\nit has logic, a battery, and\n\n526\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.520\na lot of times a driver.\n\n527\n00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.530\nThere's communication\nthat has to happen right?\n\n528\n00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.350\nYou see this in interactive\nwhiteboards and\n\n529\n00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.090\nstuff if you're in some kind of academia.\n\n530\n00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Wacom tablets are good prime example.\n\n531\n00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.320\n&gt;&gt; Great example too, the boards,\ninteractive whiteboards.\n\n532\n00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.270\nAnd again, it's because there's\na logic board in there right?\n\n533\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.460\nA quick thing on the Eno boards.\n\n534\n00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.510\nIt's like a massive QR code, and what it\nhas is a little optical sensor in it,\n\n535\n00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.700\nand when you touch it to the board,\nit essentially takes a picture and\n\n536\n00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.050\nit sends it through the driver in\na wireless interface back to the PC.\n\n537\n00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.400\nAnd the PC says, that's where you are,\nand that's how it does it.\n\n538\n00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:13.890\nThe Wacom tablets use, I believe they're\nCapacitive touch versus resistive touch,\n\n539\n00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.800\nwhich uses a series of resistive layers\nthat when you make a touch on the screen,\n\n540\n00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.170\ntwo points connect and that's how it\nkind of triangulates your position.\n\n541\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.870\nAll different kinds of great\ncool little touchscreen\n\n542\n00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.700\ntechnologies that are out there.\n\n543\n00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.110\nThey have acoustic way of interface,\ntoo that uses an acoustic sound and\n\n544\n00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.890\nwhen you touch the tablet, it breaks that\nway, but if it's, that's where you are.\n\n545\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.240\nI don't think you have to worry too\nmuch about those interfaces here.\n\n546\n00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.740\nNow, Dianne I know we're coming\nup on the end of this one.\n\n547\n00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.930\nI do wanna mention one last thing\nhere as well inside of this and\n\n548\n00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.160\nI'm gonna just brief over this and\nthe reason I say that guys\n\n549\n00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.139\nis we've already covered this\nin our display devices section.\n\n550\n00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:57.240\nBut Dan and I were kind talking\nbefore the show started and\n\n551\n00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.040\nyou made a good point well hey it is in\nhere so it makes sense to keep it here\n\n552\n00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.450\nLCD screens right two primary types of LCD\nscreens you have the twisted numanic and\n\n553\n00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:11.260\nyou have the in plane switching,\nas well flourescent back lighting\n\n554\n00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:16.170\nthey're called CCFLs cathode\nCalled Cathode Flourescent Lamps,\n\n555\n00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:21.440\nas well as LED base backlighting and\nmore and more prevalent today.\n\n556\n00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.500\nYou've already mentioned it too,\n\n557\n00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.090\nwhen you mentioned the little strip\nthat's on the back of the MAC books for\n\n558\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.580\nthe functions keys is OLED.\n\n559\n00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.340\nAnd that's Organic Light Emitting Diode,\nthe backlighting system.\n\n560\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.140\nAnd rather than using\njust a straight LED or\n\n561\n00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.410\neven a little RGB LED It's\nliterally an organic substance that\n\n562\n00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.970\nthey apply electricity to and it makes\na phosphorus glow and much more than that.\n\n563\n00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.020\nIt's makes some of the highest resolution\nand one of the greatest things about OLED\n\n564\n00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:52.270\nwhen we talk about battery life,\nOLED is probably one of the least\n\n565\n00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.460\nwhen it comes to power consumption out\nof your all mobile device interface.\n\n566\n00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.100\nThat's why it's really really\ngood in things like cell phones,\n\n567\n00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.060\ntablets as well as many of\nyour different laptops.\n\n568\n00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.310\nNow, then I know I talked a lot about that\none and I told you we were gonna share.\n\n569\n00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.630\nShow you some additional stuff, but\n\n570\n00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.420\nI don't really think we have\nenough time in this episode.\n\n571\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.310\nYeah I'm looking at the clock and\n\n572\n00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.070\nI'm doing the math, yeah we have\nzero seconds left in this episode.\n\n573\n00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:21.200\nSo not enough time here but that's great\nwe'll just roll into a part three and\n\n574\n00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.560\nlook at some of the other things that we\nhave to know about as far as the A+ exam\n\n575\n00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.640\ngoes with working with\nour laptop components.\n\n576\n00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.700\nWes we do thank you for stopping by and\nwe thank our audience for watching but\n\n577\n00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.940\nsigning off for IT PRO TV.\n\n578\n00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.522\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n579\n00:31:34.522 --> 00:31:36.839\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n580\n00:31:36.839

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.999\nWelcome to IT PRO TV I'm your\nhost Don Pezet [CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:08.221\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.135\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:13.665\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.806\nWelcome back to another exciting episode\nof ITproTV I'm your host as always\n\n6\n00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:18.776\nDaniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:22.609\nin today's episode well we're moving\non with more in our A+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.050\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain is our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.225\nWes Bryan, Wes so\nglad to see you again how is it going?\n\n10\n00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:32.835\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great we actually\nget to dive into what we've been\n\n11\n00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:37.640\nkinda hinting at for the last two episodes\nbut well we haven't actually got to right?\n\n12\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.900\nWe said we're gonna look at\na little bit at the hardware.\n\n13\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.690\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat we kinda wanna do in this,\n\n14\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.940\nthe last part here of our laptops,\nhardware, and components.\n\n15\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.910\nSo, keep in mind this might\nnot be a full 30 minutes.\n\n16\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.360\nBut we don't wanna just tell you that\nwe're gonna show you some hardware, and\n\n17\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.190\nthen not actually show you some.\n\n18\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.120\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndive in, right?\n\n19\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.810\nSome of the things that they've talked,\n\n20\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.140\nthey mention, they talk about\nthings like your memory, right?\n\n21\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.110\nWe've already mentioned,\n\n22\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.160\nwe've already talked about things like\na wireless cards and optical drives.\n\n23\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.620\nI mentioned PCIE, mini PCIE and\n\n24\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.580\nthe former or the first part of\nthis series here they we're doing.\n\n25\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.330\nSo definitely go back and check that out.\n\n26\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.080\nBut there's other things too right?\n\n27\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.030\nWe have like for instance our DC Jack.\n\n28\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.410\nThat DC jack is responsible for\nbringing the power to your to your laptop.\n\n29\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.190\nTalk about a DC jack keep in mind why do\nthey call it why is it a DJ jack right?\n\n30\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.720\nWell, keep in mind computer circuitry\nruns off a direct current doesn't run off\n\n31\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.660\nyou're alternating current so coming from\nthe wall we have alternating current going\n\n32\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.130\ninto your power adapter that does\nessentially a converter if you will and\n\n33\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.540\nconverts it from AC to DC and\nwell that's why we call it a DC jack.\n\n34\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.620\nBatteries again a lot of time these\nbatteries today are integrated right into\n\n35\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.800\nthe device itself and\n\n36\n00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.430\na lot of times you can't even remove them\nanymore however We've got an old one here\n\n37\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.690\nthat we're gonna look at it in a second\nthat you can actually remove the battery.\n\n38\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.520\nTouchpad interfaces we've already\nmentioned that because as\n\n39\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.920\na way to interact with the device keep\nin mind you have your touch pads,\n\n40\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.000\nyou've seen it in we talked about in I\nbelieve it was part two here of laptops.\n\n41\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.190\nWe talked about the ability\nto turn it on and off,\n\n42\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.330\nit is the way that you\ninteract with a laptop.\n\n43\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.810\nSpeakers, right?\n\n44\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.560\nSpeakers are built-in.\n\n45\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.520\nYou have the speakers built\nright into the laptop itself.\n\n46\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.770\nIt's the way we can hear audio.\n\n47\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.730\nKeep in mind, you also have audio\njacks on the outside too that allow\n\n48\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.270\nyou to connect to things like\nheadphones as well as microphones.\n\n49\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.640\nNow the other things as well\nthat we have are webcams, right?\n\n50\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.180\nWebcams are built into\nthese devices as well so\n\n51\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.410\nthat you don't have to\nbuy an external webcam.\n\n52\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.510\nHowever, if you happen to not\nhave one of those webcams.\n\n53\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.130\nThey're just really so popular today,\nI almost don't see you finding one\n\n54\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.735\nunless it's a very old laptop not\nhaving one built into the device.\n\n55\n00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:01.145\nThat you have them typically built-in.\n\n56\n00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:05.185\nAgain, you might be able to going along\nwith the webcam, we gotta be able to hear\n\n57\n00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.475\nif you've gonna be in some kind\nof interactive video, right?\n\n58\n00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:11.290\nSome kinda conferencing system, so\nyou'll also have microphones built-in too.\n\n59\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.000\nAll right so I wanna talk just\nbriefly about some of the hard drives.\n\n60\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.200\nWe've already talked about them.\n\n61\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.290\nWe've kinda showed you some of them.\n\n62\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.750\nBut what I'd really like\nto do is kinda show you\n\n63\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.490\nthe inner workings of\nthe drives themselves.\n\n64\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.060\nSo I've got a couple of different types\nhere that you've seen in part one here.\n\n65\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.700\nAnd if we could take a look at this\nyou'll see here that what we have\n\n66\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.390\nis the mechanical drive that\nwe were talking about earlier.\n\n67\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.290\nAnd we also have the solid state drive.\n\n68\n00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.520\nNow we've gone ahead and we've taken\nthe mechanical drives apart and\n\n69\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.240\nwe've also taken the electrical\nsolid state drive apart so\n\n70\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.660\nwe can kinda show you the inside the guts.\n\n71\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.020\nIf we can zoom in real quick,\nI wanna show you right here,\n\n72\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.780\nyou'll notice something about laptops.\n\n73\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.200\nLet me go ahead and just say right away\nhere that when it comes to laptops, Dan,\n\n74\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.660\nyou can see, man,\nwe got all different types of screws.\n\n75\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.660\nAnd one of the things that\nyou want to do is document.\n\n76\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.850\nYou could take your cell phone out and\ntalking about a webcam.\n\n77\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.530\nTake the camera and take pictures of it.\n\n78\n00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.280\nI like to separate them here.\n\n79\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.510\nBecause there you'll see that\nthere's many different sizes.\n\n80\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.950\nEach one of these groups\nis a different size here.\n\n81\n00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.240\nSometimes they make it easy for us.\n\n82\n00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.070\nSo they have little blue markings on this\none that shows you that all of these\n\n83\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.730\nkinda go together.\n\n84\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.850\nThey're the same size and\n\n85\n00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.970\nit makes it kinda gives you\na visualization that these are the same.\n\n86\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.190\nHowever, keep in mind as well though,\n\n87\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.520\nyou do want to keep them separate cuz\nthese also have blue marks on them too.\n\n88\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Well it's Locktite.\n\n89\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it is the blue Locktite\nkeeping them from backing themselves out\n\n90\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.160\nthat's good to know, I wish I could say\nI actually knew that right that's right.\n\n91\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.830\nIt helps prevent things like chip creep,\nthat's one of the reasons\n\n92\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.700\nwe have zero resistant insertion for\nsockets today so yeah I absolutely\n\n93\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.715\ndid learn something I've always thought\nthat was a nice marking note thank you.\n\n94\n00:04:54.715 --> 00:04:56.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Put the same color on every screw.\n\n95\n00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So.\n\n96\n00:04:57.742 --> 00:04:59.610\n&gt;&gt; They really didn't think\nthat through did they?\n\n97\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.330\n&gt;&gt; They didn't.\n\n98\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.450\nThat's right.\n\n99\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.400\nSo notice that we've kinda\ngot them separated here.\n\n100\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.770\nNow if we go back to that shot too you'll\nsee that there are all different types of\n\n101\n00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.350\ntools here.\n\n102\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.240\nAnd this just happens to be an iFixit kit,\nand these are some of the tools that we've\n\n103\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.362\nused in order to take this laptop\napart as well as as these hard drives.\n\n104\n00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:18.560\nAll right, so speaking of hard drives,\nlet the show go on here.\n\n105\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.520\nWe're going to go ahead.\n\n106\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.540\nIf we could back that camera\nout just a little bit,\n\n107\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.670\nwe will show you the inner-workings\nof one of these hard drives.\n\n108\n00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.750\nNow again, keep in mind that this is no\ndifferent than any other mechanical drive,\n\n109\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.470\nright, this just happens to\nbe a two inch form factor,\n\n110\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.190\nyou can see your actuators there's\na read/write head here and\n\n111\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.250\nit spins,\nunderstand that this is no longer good.\n\n112\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.207\n&gt;&gt; It also works as a personal\nshaving [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:40.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and\n\n114\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.060\nit's kinda sharp too, so be very careful\nit's one of the reason I have gloves on\n\n115\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.360\nthis, remember we told you in part one\nhere, that these are glass platters,\n\n116\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.810\nthese aren't metal platters like some\npeople, it does look, like it's a metal\n\n117\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.260\nplatter, but you have to be careful cuz\nsome of these platters are glass and\n\n118\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.726\nthen when they shatter,\nlet me tell you they shatter.\n\n119\n00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:04.290\nYou can see the actuator motor here,\nit's responsible for\n\n120\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.450\ncontrolling the read/write\nhead as it goes back and\n\n121\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.320\nforth across the cylinders here.\n\n122\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.970\nAnd it'll stop on a certain sector\nwithin the drive, again, reading or\n\n123\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.490\nwriting that data.\n\n124\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.360\nAgain, there's a couple of\npoints of failure here.\n\n125\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.610\nAgain, keep in mind,\nthe motor can fail outright,\n\n126\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.620\nnot even move the read/write head.\n\n127\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.040\nAnd we also have the fact that\nwe can get a head crash, too.\n\n128\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.540\nAgain, you can have for instance,\nyou have bearings here in this thing.\n\n129\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.450\nMoves very, very fast.\n\n130\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.648\nIf the head does crush again its just\ngonna bounce off of these platters here,\n\n131\n00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:42.710\nall right?\n\n132\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.050\nThe other thing we have here too\nis the balancer I know its kinda\n\n133\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.760\nhard to see there but\nyou can kinda see that it's positioned\n\n134\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.770\nbetween the two platters you can see\nthere's actually two disks right?\n\n135\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.260\nTwo platters as they call them there, and\n\n136\n00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.085\nwe end up having essentially a double\nstacked read/write head here and\n\n137\n00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.390\nthere's actually two of these read/write\nheads here moving in and out.\n\n138\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.010\nAnd as the densities of\nthese platters get greater\n\n139\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.020\nyou end up seeing that they can put more\nand more of these heads on a single disk.\n\n140\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.780\nBut for the most part this is\na your mechanical drive, and\n\n141\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.230\nit is this one just happens to be,\nthis is a serial interface,\n\n142\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.450\nyou could see like one of the ones I'm\ngonna pull out here is an old one, this is\n\n143\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.980\nthe old IDE drive that's in this one we'll\nshow you kinda how you would remove that.\n\n144\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.920\nAll right so that's one of them, we do\nhave another one here that we wanna keep\n\n145\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:38.440\nin mind here and this is the,\nthis is the solid state drive, right?\n\n146\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.320\nAnd if I pull the top of that off,\nthis is essentially what you have.\n\n147\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.610\nThis one works.\n\n148\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.559\nIt's 128 gig, so by today's SSD standards,\nit's relatively small,\n\n149\n00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:51.972\nbut however, it does work, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:55.587\nAnd we use so many, you know,\nvirtual machines on here.\n\n151\n00:07:55.587 --> 00:07:59.756\nWe really don't wanna mess with\nthis one too much cuz again,\n\n152\n00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:04.825\nI don't have the right utilities on to\nbe touching anything that has a high\n\n153\n00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:09.600\nsensitivity to electrostatic\ndischarge again so keep that in mind.\n\n154\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.640\nLike we mentioned in earlier episodes and\n\n155\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.330\nI do wanna give a shout\nout to our chat room.\n\n156\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.320\nWe did mention this in\nan earlier episode but\n\n157\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.680\nalso reminding us remember\nwith these mechanical drives.\n\n158\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.501\nWe told you that whether\nyou pull the platters out,\n\n159\n00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:27.583\nits almost next to impossible to\nrebalance them cuz they are magnetized.\n\n160\n00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:31.519\nAnd again they are, the other thing\nto keep in mind is that they are also\n\n161\n00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:35.544\nbalanced in a way that if they're\noff just a big you're gonna corrupt.\n\n162\n00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:37.488\nNot necessarily maybe corrupt the data but\n\n163\n00:08:37.488 --> 00:08:39.920\nyou're not gonna be able\nto re-read the data again.\n\n164\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920\nEvery drive even in a batch of\ndrives that are the same model and\n\n165\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.606\nmanufacture are so\nfine tuned that they have very,\n\n166\n00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:49.910\nvery tight tolerances and\nthey don't really do well once open.\n\n167\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.270\nThat's why this drive is going to\ngo through some data irradiation.\n\n168\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.722\nAnd one of the ultimate data\nirradiation is complete destruction or\n\n169\n00:08:57.722 --> 00:08:59.761\njust let Wes open it on camera.\n\n170\n00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:03.058\n&gt;&gt; Give me a can of thermite and two\nminutes and that drive is gone forever.\n\n171\n00:09:03.058 --> 00:09:04.941\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it, and\n\n172\n00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:07.820\nyou guys might say well jeez Dan\nthat's a little bit overkill.\n\n173\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.050\nNo it's not that's actually a very valid\nform of data destruction, especially when\n\n174\n00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.290\nit contains things like HIPAA\ncompliance and PCI based information.\n\n175\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.713\nPersonal healthcare information,\nthey absolutely do that.\n\n176\n00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:23.411\nIn fact one of the things that I like to\ndo is take them out to the pistol range\n\n177\n00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:25.510\nand use them as target practice, right?\n\n178\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.430\nCuz again,\nphysical destruction is the best.\n\n179\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.090\nNow if you think that's overkill,\n\n180\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.440\na lot of times some people will tell\nyou that just couple of drills through\n\n181\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.490\nthe platters all the way through\nbasically will help eradicate any data.\n\n182\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.090\nBut that's for another episode but\nit is nonetheless something to know about.\n\n183\n00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.643\nSo again,\nthat is our solid state drives here, Dan.\n\n184\n00:09:44.643 --> 00:09:47.395\nNow, there is one that I\nfailed to mention here.\n\n185\n00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:50.158\nAnd this was something we were talking\nabout before we started the episode and\n\n186\n00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:51.910\nthat's called the hybrid.\n\n187\n00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.850\nAnd really, you know what?\n\n188\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.477\nInstead of moving on,\nlet's go back to these drives here.\n\n189\n00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:59.540\nWith these open, I can explain\nwhat the hybrid's doing okay.\n\n190\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.550\nSo a hybrid drive, right?\n\n191\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.830\nThis is a solid state drive.\n\n192\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.000\nThis is our mechanical drive.\n\n193\n00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.170\nA hybrid drive is essentially a drive\nthat kind of does something like this,\n\n194\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.460\nkeeps the same form factor.\n\n195\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.710\nNow, understand the form factor's the\nsame, but for theory purposes, what we see\n\n196\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.160\nhere is that it'll have a mechanical drive\nand then it will have a space in here.\n\n197\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.090\nOr, depending on the thickness,\ncuz stacking height is also something.\n\n198\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.107\nRemember, we said, very, very shallow.\n\n199\n00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:27.661\nA space within laptops where you might\neven have one of these solid state boards\n\n200\n00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.030\nwith just a couple of chips, right.\n\n201\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.590\nJust a couple of the NAND flash\nchips that are on the board itself.\n\n202\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:38.750\nAnd what happens is infrequently used data\nis going to be basically kept on the disk.\n\n203\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.930\nHowever, data that is optimized or used\nmore frequently is gonna be stored in kind\n\n204\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.100\nof like a buffering system if you will.\n\n205\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.501\nOn the NAN flash memory,\n\n206\n00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:50.247\nit's kinda akin Dan what we talk\nabout when we mention CPUs right.\n\n207\n00:10:50.247 --> 00:10:54.458\nThey use a caching system and frequently\nheld instructions are in that caching\n\n208\n00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:56.691\nsystem because it's basically an SRAM,\n\n209\n00:10:56.691 --> 00:11:00.800\nstatic random access memory that's\nlocated on the chip and very very fast.\n\n210\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.770\nIt helps to keep\nthe performance of the CPU up.\n\n211\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.928\nThe process here is that it's kinda like\na high speed buffer, if you will, for\n\n212\n00:11:07.928 --> 00:11:08.942\nyour hard drives.\n\n213\n00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:11.060\nAll right, so that is.\n\n214\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.520\nThere's also another form factor,\nnot quite as, I mean it's out there, and\n\n215\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.720\nI don't wanna say that it.\n\n216\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.618\nI guess I can't say it's not quite as\ncommon just because I haven't really\n\n217\n00:11:18.618 --> 00:11:19.594\nworked with it too much.\n\n218\n00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:23.702\n1.8 inch form factor, one of some of\nthe most common that I do see though\n\n219\n00:11:23.702 --> 00:11:27.490\nare the 2.5 inch form factor when\nit comes to your laptop drives.\n\n220\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.510\nNow that being said we mentioned the term\nmemory right, we talked about SO-DIMM,\n\n221\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.570\nsingle outline dual inline memory module\nkeep in mind that's the form factor.\n\n222\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.298\nThe standards however do change, right?\n\n223\n00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:40.674\nAnd that could be DDR for\nthe exam purposes, DDR2,\n\n224\n00:11:40.674 --> 00:11:43.540\nDDR3 and again current standard.\n\n225\n00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.590\nWhich, I don't believe you have\nto worry about for the exam but\n\n226\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.030\nwe'll mention it here nonetheless and\nthat's DDR4.\n\n227\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.762\nSo let's go ahead and let's look at the\nlaptop maybe on a more grand scale here if\n\n228\n00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:54.186\nwe could zoom back out.\n\n229\n00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:58.470\nAnd we'll look at the laptop because\nwhat I wanna focus on right here is this\n\n230\n00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.140\nsection here.\n\n231\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.440\nAll right so\nwith your laptops this is an older laptop.\n\n232\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.900\nSometimes you have the ability\nto get to these parts.\n\n233\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.620\nI'm gonna show you on the Macbook we'll\nactually take the back of the Macbook\n\n234\n00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.870\noff and look at it.\n\n235\n00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.260\nWe're not gonna really dive too\nmuch into that one on camera.\n\n236\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.670\nBut I do wanna show you that In the older\ndays we had a lot thicker devices, right.\n\n237\n00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.875\nThey've really,\nreally become short or very compact.\n\n238\n00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:26.320\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nsee if I can't take the battery off.\n\n239\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.900\nSo they also mentioned the battery.\n\n240\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.310\nThese batteries have kind of gone\nby the wayside today [LAUGH] for\n\n241\n00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.420\na lot of the laptops.\n\n242\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.860\nNot necessarily but you can have batteries\nthat are built right into the motherboard.\n\n243\n00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.450\nIf we could zoom in\njust a little bit here.\n\n244\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.980\nYou'll see that if I take this cover off,\nthere you go, that's perfect, thank you.\n\n245\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.596\nThat I have a sewed in memory module here.\n\n246\n00:12:45.596 --> 00:12:49.608\nAnd the sewed in memory module,\nagain, keep in mind guys, this,\n\n247\n00:12:49.608 --> 00:12:53.130\nI should not be doing this on\na production based machine.\n\n248\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.940\nAgain, this is an older laptop, and\nrather than just throw it away,\n\n249\n00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.950\nI wanna use it for training purposes.\n\n250\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.150\nNow one of the things that you might see,\nis that when I\n\n251\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.010\nundid these clips on the side it\nkinda raised that memory module up.\n\n252\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.790\nWell, that's so that you can get to it.\n\n253\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.360\nAnd this essentially is\na SO-DIMM memory module.\n\n254\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.395\nNotice that it's double stacked,\nI told you, four chips, four chips.\n\n255\n00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.530\nSo, eight total here.\n\n256\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.580\nAnd notice that it is about half the size\nof what a dual inline memory module is.\n\n257\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.590\nThese, you have to be very careful.\n\n258\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.643\nAgain, this is like holding\na rattlesnake here.\n\n259\n00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:33.641\nYou should not be doing this but\nagain, this is an old, old stick here,\n\n260\n00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:34.519\nmight be a gig.\n\n261\n00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:40.126\nAnd again, memory is definitely very\nsusceptible to electrostatic discharge.\n\n262\n00:13:40.126 --> 00:13:44.040\nAnd with the gloves that I have on,\nagain, shouldn't be handling it this way.\n\n263\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.740\nBut again, we're gonna be throwing this\none out after this episode is here.\n\n264\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.717\nBut we figured it'd be a good way to show\nyou guys some of the components here.\n\n265\n00:13:52.717 --> 00:14:00.900\nThe memory module here, it fits into\nthe slot on the motherboard as well.\n\n266\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.020\nAll right, and we do have other things\nhere too that we need to take a look at.\n\n267\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.720\nI mentioned the hard drive,\nthe hard drive is right here.\n\n268\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.930\nAnd I've already gone through and\nloosened these up guys, so\n\n269\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.910\nyou don't have to see me struggle\n[LAUGH] with some of these screws.\n\n270\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.390\nYou can see that we've got a lot of\nstuff that's already taken out here.\n\n271\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.620\nAnd if I take this cover off, you'll see.\n\n272\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.940\nThis is one of the older drives.\n\n273\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.160\nThis is actually an older IDE drive,\nso it doesn't have the SATA interface.\n\n274\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.080\nAnd depending on the model and\nthe manufacturer.\n\n275\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.300\nYou might say that they'll have a little\ntab here that you can pull the whole drive\n\n276\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.190\nout or\n\n277\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.010\nit might be just as simple as pushing the\ndrive back just like that and it clicks.\n\n278\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.849\nAnd then you bring it up and\nthere you go you remove the drive so\n\n279\n00:14:37.849 --> 00:14:40.849\nnothing too fancy here and\nyou can see the drive controller here.\n\n280\n00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:45.190\nAgain this is the old IDE\ninterface parallel interface.\n\n281\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.400\nAgain you might still see them out there\nif somebody's got an older laptop.\n\n282\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.910\nMore often than not you're seeing the\nserial ATA interfaces that we have here.\n\n283\n00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.130\nAnd a lot of times you see NAND\nflash chips that are basically\n\n284\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.950\njust like the memory module\nthat you've seen here.\n\n285\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.234\nThey're actually located\nright on the motherboard.\n\n286\n00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.387\nSo that's your hard drive,\n\n287\n00:15:03.387 --> 00:15:06.182\nand that would be one of the ways that\nyou would get the hard drive out.\n\n288\n00:15:06.182 --> 00:15:09.384\nSome of the other things that we have,\nwe have wireless adapter,\n\n289\n00:15:09.384 --> 00:15:12.471\nand I want you to be careful with\nthe wireless adapter and more so\n\n290\n00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:15.290\nthan anything the wireless\nadapters antenna.\n\n291\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.340\nBecause a lot of times the antenna\nis a single wire that actually\n\n292\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:23.320\ngoes along the outside\nof the display itself.\n\n293\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.410\nSo if you're replacing an antenna,\nor even more so\n\n294\n00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.620\nif you're replacing a display on a laptop,\nyou have to be very careful.\n\n295\n00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.720\nCuz you can't just pull the display off,\ncuz what you'll do is you run the risk of\n\n296\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.160\nliterally yanking the antenna\nright out of the wireless adapter.\n\n297\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.973\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n298\n00:15:34.973 --> 00:15:39.960\nIf we zoom back in on this portion\nright here, this is, I believe,\n\n299\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.250\nwhere our wireless adaptor is,\nyeah it's right there.\n\n300\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.839\nSo you can see a couple\nof things here right,\n\n301\n00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:52.883\nyou can see there is your wireless\nintel adapter for this one,\n\n302\n00:15:52.883 --> 00:15:57.733\nand here is your main power supply and\nyour auxiliary here,\n\n303\n00:15:57.733 --> 00:16:02.109\nis your antenna and\nthat is a very, very little wire.\n\n304\n00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:03.845\nAnd it makes surround the outside.\n\n305\n00:16:03.845 --> 00:16:07.336\nIt's antenna placement's around\nthe outside of the display,so you gotta\n\n306\n00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:07.950\nbe careful.\n\n307\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.485\nAnd if you pull this off,\nright, just a little snaps here,\n\n308\n00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:17.867\nthis has also you basically kinda\nlike the same thing with your sodem.\n\n309\n00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:22.375\nAnd you pop that out right there.\n\n310\n00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:23.470\nAnd there you go.\n\n311\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.333\nYou got your little wireless adaptor.\n\n312\n00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:29.700\nNow, they're a lot smaller than\nwhat you see right here today.\n\n313\n00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:35.450\nBut again, there is your wireless\nadapter and your power supply.\n\n314\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.687\nAnd when I say power supply,\nlet me clarify.\n\n315\n00:16:37.687 --> 00:16:41.380\nI mean power to the adaptor itself and\nthe antennas here.\n\n316\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.880\nAll right, so other things that we have.\n\n317\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.390\nOne of the things that's\nunique to all laptops.\n\n318\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:54.160\nAnd I say unique to laptops versus\na desktop, is the cooling system.\n\n319\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.240\nThe cooling system works much like a heat\nexchange system does in your HVAC systems,\n\n320\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.672\nas well as combining kinda like\na radiator-type functionality of your\n\n321\n00:17:03.672 --> 00:17:04.210\nheat sinks.\n\n322\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.918\nBut again,\nremember we don't have a lot of space.\n\n323\n00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:07.186\nSo we'll go back to this computer.\n\n324\n00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:10.440\nI'll pull the cover off, and\nyou'll kinda see this here.\n\n325\n00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.210\nLet's see if I can do this without\ncompletely ripping everything apart here.\n\n326\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.080\nThis got a little clip even though.\n\n327\n00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.405\nAnd if we kinda zoom in here,\n\n328\n00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:22.580\nyou'll see that what we have is,\nno get that back in there.\n\n329\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.160\nIt's not your turn to come out yet.\n\n330\n00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.710\nIf we can kinda zoom back out.\n\n331\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.616\nI'm sorry I've got you all over the place.\n\n332\n00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:29.600\nPerfect, thank you, perfect job.\n\n333\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.910\nYou'll see that on the side\nhere is our vents, right?\n\n334\n00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.059\nAnd that's actually exhausting air.\n\n335\n00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:39.360\nAnd underneath this,\nbelieve it not, is the CPU, right?\n\n336\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.090\nAnd then the CPU essentially as\nit heats up, it dissipates and\n\n337\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.100\nit pulls the air off through\nthis copper tubing, if you will.\n\n338\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.606\nAnd then, we've got a fan right here\nthat will actually blow that, try to.\n\n339\n00:17:54.606 --> 00:18:02.169\nAgain, the goal is to exhaust that hot\nair right out the back of the device.\n\n340\n00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:04.836\nI'm gonna pull that optical\ndrive out there for a second and\n\n341\n00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.020\nsee if we can get this off.\n\n342\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:11.670\nSome of these clips will\ngo back into place and\n\n343\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.870\nit makes it next to impossible to\ntry to get off here on camera.\n\n344\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.770\nBut we'll give it a shot.\n\n345\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:23.530\nAnd thank goodness that we are not going\nto be putting this one back into play,\n\n346\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.270\nbecause you really shouldn't\nbe manhandling this so much.\n\n347\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.200\nThere we go.\n\n348\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.150\nIf we open that up there, now you can\nsee that we have the fan right here.\n\n349\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.210\nAnd the fan, again, is a very,\nvery thin form factor fan.\n\n350\n00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.795\nI would probably guess\nto say that is maybe\n\n351\n00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:46.780\na half inch to three\nquarters of an inch high.\n\n352\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.650\nAnd again, as the CPU under here heats up,\nit basically exhausts\n\n353\n00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:56.160\nthis hot air through this copper\ntubing to this section here.\n\n354\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.880\nAnd then, as the fan spins right here,\nit basically will shunt or\n\n355\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.870\ndissipate the air out of\nthe back of the case, all right?\n\n356\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.392\nSo, a couple of things that you\ncan see here from this one.\n\n357\n00:19:07.392 --> 00:19:10.960\nI did go ahead and\npull the optical drive on this one.\n\n358\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.590\nI will say that one of the great things is\n\n359\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:19.510\nbecause you're starting to see\noptical media not used so much,\n\n360\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.810\nI mean it's still there obviously,\nthere's still an industry for it.\n\n361\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.500\nBut because you're starting to see\nless and less of the optical media,\n\n362\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.510\none of our hosts actually upgraded\nhis computer when he ordered it,\n\n363\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.130\ncuz he had no use for\nthe optical drive anymore.\n\n364\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.868\nAnd it became another storage location.\n\n365\n00:19:34.868 --> 00:19:38.970\nSo, you could expand and I think he put\nlike a terrabyte drive in its place.\n\n366\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.090\nAnd instead of being the optical drive,\nwell, he's got a terrabyte drive that slid\n\n367\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.940\nin and\nconnected to the interface right there.\n\n368\n00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.650\nAnd it's the serial ATA interface.\n\n369\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.670\nI don't know if this one has it.\n\n370\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.590\nThis is probably a proprietary\nform factor, right?\n\n371\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.280\nSo usually, your optical drive,\nespecially in your desktops,\n\n372\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.070\nwill have a Serial ATA interface.\n\n373\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.170\nAnd again, it's kinda funny.\n\n374\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.410\nAgain, I don't think I mentioned that.\n\n375\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.006\nI probably should mention that,\n\n376\n00:20:01.006 --> 00:20:04.207\nis that laptops don't necessarily\nfollow any standard, right?\n\n377\n00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:10.308\nThey're very, very specific, just like\nthe docking stations that we mentioned to,\n\n378\n00:20:10.308 --> 00:20:13.420\nas well to wh,atever the manufacturer is.\n\n379\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.670\nNow, there's another component, and\n\n380\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.610\nwe can just keep that camera right there,\nthat I wanna mention.\n\n381\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.640\nDan, you talked about that\nold laptop that you had.\n\n382\n00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.650\nWhat were you doing to\nget around the display?\n\n383\n00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.880\nYou said you'd found one in a garbage.\n\n384\n00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.113\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did, it had one of the LCDs,\nand the backlight went bad.\n\n385\n00:20:34.113 --> 00:20:38.670\nSo, I just hooked up a monitor to it,\nan external monitor.\n\n386\n00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.810\nAnd like you used to say,\n\n387\n00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:44.620\nthere was an actual function key that\nwould export out to an external monitor.\n\n388\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.630\nHooked it right up and\nstarted using it as a desktop.\n\n389\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.280\nSo, got a free laptop [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and\n\n390\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.130\nlet me show you that component that he's\ntalking about, because it's on the exam.\n\n391\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.660\nYou see this little circuit board here?\n\n392\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.520\nIt's about that big right there, right?\n\n393\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.640\nAnd it's kinda hard to see, but that's\ncalled a backlight inverter, all right?\n\n394\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.191\nNow, on your exam objectives\nthey just say inverter, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:09.206\nWell, let me tell you, your power\nsupplies are a converter, all right?\n\n396\n00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:11.625\nAnd that's AC to DC.\n\n397\n00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:14.405\nIt's gonna sound like a heavy\nmetal show here in a second.\n\n398\n00:21:14.405 --> 00:21:19.320\nAn inverter takes DC and\ninverts it back to AC.\n\n399\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.786\nSo, what's going on here?\n\n400\n00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:26.797\nNo, it is not the fact that your laptop\ndoesn't know what it wants to do,\n\n401\n00:21:26.797 --> 00:21:29.620\nthat it can't make up its mind.\n\n402\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.422\nYour computer circuitry works,\nif I could say that, off a DC current,\n\n403\n00:21:34.422 --> 00:21:36.460\ndirect current.\n\n404\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.315\nWell, when the AC current comes from\nthe wall, it hits your power adapter.\n\n405\n00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:43.700\nYour power adapter converts it\ninto direct current, right?\n\n406\n00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.290\nSo, we've gone from AC to DC.\n\n407\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:52.737\nHowever, your LCD and\nLED screens do not run off of DC.\n\n408\n00:21:52.737 --> 00:21:54.235\nThey run off of AC.\n\n409\n00:21:54.235 --> 00:21:59.320\nSo, this is kinda like your computer\nhaving power identity issues, if you will.\n\n410\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.380\nLet me show you here.\n\n411\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.140\nSo, if we go back to this,\nnotice this little inverter.\n\n412\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.190\nSo, as the DC current goes along\nthe laptop powering all the components,\n\n413\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.490\nwhen it needs to hit the monitor and\npower the monitor,\n\n414\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:18.770\nthe inverter, all right,\nconverts it back to alternating current.\n\n415\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.010\nAnd it's also responsible for\nthe backlighting, too.\n\n416\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.880\nHence the term backlight inverter.\n\n417\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.900\nBacklighting, lighting the LCD, right?\n\n418\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.830\nInverter, in the fact that it's inverting\nthe direct current on the motherboard\n\n419\n00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.082\nback into alternating current.\n\n420\n00:22:35.082 --> 00:22:37.830\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\n\n421\n00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.860\nthe next thing I'd like to\ndo is kinda flip this apart.\n\n422\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:45.700\nAnd we'll see, I'm not sure if I\ncan actually show you guys this.\n\n423\n00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.300\nWe're gonna attempt it here.\n\n424\n00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.184\nAll right, now here's the display.\n\n425\n00:22:50.184 --> 00:22:54.020\nAnd you gotta be very,\nvery careful with the displays themselves.\n\n426\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.320\nI went ahead and\nkinda popped this off beforehand.\n\n427\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.510\nJust because, again, it's one of\nthose things that trying to finagle\n\n428\n00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:09.760\nit as one of our guys out there in\nthe chat room can attest to this,\n\n429\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.110\nit becomes a nightmare trying\nto get these things off.\n\n430\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.660\nLet alone, if you talk about\ntrying to do it on camera.\n\n431\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.310\nIf we could,\n\n432\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:25.750\nI don't know if we can, I want you to\nsee these wires that are right here.\n\n433\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.890\nAnd if you can see those wires,\n\n434\n00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:33.218\nthat is actually the wireless adaptor\nantenna that we were talking about there.\n\n435\n00:23:33.218 --> 00:23:34.680\nPerfect, great.\n\n436\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.224\nNotice that it goes right\nin here to the monitor.\n\n437\n00:23:37.224 --> 00:23:44.170\nAnd what's happening is it is going and\nsnaking around the outside of the display.\n\n438\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:50.436\nAnd that's why we say, when you go to take\none of these off, did you see that, Dan?\n\n439\n00:23:50.436 --> 00:23:52.019\nDo you see that cable right there?\n\n440\n00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:58.320\nAnd there, sure enough,\nthere is essentially the wireless antenna.\n\n441\n00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.444\n&gt;&gt; I just pull real hard.\n\n442\n00:23:59.444 --> 00:24:00.225\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go,\n\n443\n00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:03.756\nthere we go We also have the keyboard\nthat we have to look at too.\n\n444\n00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:08.740\nAnd interestingly enough, this keyboard,\nI've already taken it off, be careful.\n\n445\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.450\nLadies and gentlemen, if you've ever tried\nto put a ribbon cable on and attach that\n\n446\n00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.810\nribbon cable and then make sure its\nattached and put the keyboard back on.\n\n447\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.850\nYou are in for a fun time at the office,\nlet me tell you.\n\n448\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.780\nNow, I also wanted to show\nyou one last thing here.\n\n449\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.375\nNotice the battery?\n\n450\n00:24:27.375 --> 00:24:29.630\nThat's your CMOS battery.\n\n451\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.599\nNotice what I had to do to get to it?\n\n452\n00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:36.840\nI darn near had to take everything on\nthis laptop apart to get to it, right?\n\n453\n00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.760\nNow, I will say that this, believe it or\nnot, by today's standards is a lot\n\n454\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.370\neasier than some of the other\nlaptops you have out there.\n\n455\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.220\nBecause a lot of times you won't\nhave access to this, right?\n\n456\n00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.480\nSo those are some of the components that\nI want you to be aware of on the exam.\n\n457\n00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.140\nNow, there is something else\nthat we wanna kinda show you.\n\n458\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.366\nBecause you've seen all the space\nwe have in here, all right?\n\n459\n00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:07.100\nMore alter compact type devices like\nthe Mac, we won't have that option.\n\n460\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.727\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is the MacBook, right?\n\n461\n00:25:10.727 --> 00:25:11.623\nI almost said Mac top.\n\n462\n00:25:11.623 --> 00:25:15.906\n[LAUGH] The MacBook Pro that we had,\nwe wanna kinda open up the back of it and\n\n463\n00:25:15.906 --> 00:25:19.083\nshow you the difference of\na more modern technology.\n\n464\n00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:23.768\nSo you can kinda get a view of\nwhat you would see more likely in\n\n465\n00:25:23.768 --> 00:25:26.410\ntoday's environment.\n\n466\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.970\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I'm seeing a bit of\na difference in technology\n\n467\n00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.550\nwith this newer form factor here.\n\n468\n00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.970\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you notice right away\njust how much more compact it is, right?\n\n469\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.781\nRemember, we talked about storage, right?\n\n470\n00:25:36.781 --> 00:25:40.010\nYou could see things like your storage and\nyour memory all integrated.\n\n471\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.860\nNow, there are, this is integrated,\nright into the motherboard, right?\n\n472\n00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.450\nYou do have some pieces that\ncan still be removed, right?\n\n473\n00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.782\nYou still have the typical radiator type\nsystem, but notice how compact it is.\n\n474\n00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:52.840\nAnd notice this whole thing,\nthat's your battery.\n\n475\n00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.570\nYour battery is integrated\nright into the board itself.\n\n476\n00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.688\nSo a lot of the same features you have,\nhere's your wireless adapter, or yeah,\n\n477\n00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:01.828\nyour wireless network adapter, right?\n\n478\n00:26:01.828 --> 00:26:05.887\nAnd you can see the same kind of little\nthing going on here, the cables and stuff.\n\n479\n00:26:05.887 --> 00:26:09.219\nBut just notice how everything is so\ncompact, right?\n\n480\n00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:14.015\nWe're talking about a form factor that\nyou could probably place this whole\n\n481\n00:26:14.015 --> 00:26:16.688\nthing inside of the case of the other one.\n\n482\n00:26:16.688 --> 00:26:21.500\nAnd maybe even have room to put another\none for as far as width goes here.\n\n483\n00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.940\nSo that's really what you're seeing is\nthe difference is things get smaller,\n\n484\n00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.900\nthey get faster, they get more compact.\n\n485\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.124\nAnd with the fact that they\ncontrol heat much better, again,\n\n486\n00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:34.730\nyou're seeing that there\nis a major difference.\n\n487\n00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.368\nNow, understand that devices like\nthis sometimes don't have field\n\n488\n00:26:39.368 --> 00:26:42.370\nservicable parts, which means,\nI'm gonna have to call in.\n\n489\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.320\nI'm gonna potentially, in Apple's case,\n\n490\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.480\nyou have AppleCare if you paid for\nit, let them fix it.\n\n491\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.850\nRight, I mean that's what\nyou paid the money for.\n\n492\n00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:56.070\nBut just keep in mind that certain things,\nyou might not be able to\n\n493\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.920\nhave access to them as easy as you can\nsome of the earlier devices as well.\n\n494\n00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.870\nBut that kinda shows you, and\n\n495\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.290\none little thing here too is\nwe talked about the vents.\n\n496\n00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.083\nRemember, I was showing you that\nin the earlier parts that, yeah,\n\n497\n00:27:09.083 --> 00:27:10.367\nwe still have the same system.\n\n498\n00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:12.878\nBut the bend is actually right\nthere between the screen, right?\n\n499\n00:27:12.878 --> 00:27:17.325\nAnd again, so tolerances, again,\nit does't have much tolerance.\n\n500\n00:27:17.325 --> 00:27:17.975\nYou get less and\n\n501\n00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:21.380\nless tolerance when you get things\nthat are more compact like this.\n\n502\n00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.593\nRemember that yes, I do have gloves off.\n\n503\n00:27:23.593 --> 00:27:27.718\nI don't have any electrostatic wrist\nwrap on, but you'll notice one thing.\n\n504\n00:27:27.718 --> 00:27:31.220\nI am not touching any part of this board,\nsame thing with the SSD.\n\n505\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.480\nYou'll notice that I didn't touch\nany single part of the SSD, guys and\n\n506\n00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.260\ngals out there.\n\n507\n00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.770\nThat is one of the things to keep in mind.\n\n508\n00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:47.060\nThese devices, yes, they become better and\nmore tolerable if you will of ESD.\n\n509\n00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.309\nBut when you've got a CPU that is sitting\nin a device like this that the CPU\n\n510\n00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:58.266\nby itself could cost $1,100, I don't\nthink it's a chance you wanna take.\n\n511\n00:27:58.266 --> 00:27:59.600\nThe risk is just too great.\n\n512\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.397\nSo those are a couple of the components\nthat you can see within your motherboards,\n\n513\n00:28:03.397 --> 00:28:04.450\nwithin your laptops.\n\n514\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:09.470\nKeep in mind there's never a one size\nfits all, they're very proprietary.\n\n515\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.510\nIf you have something like Apple, they're\nvery, very controlling on the hardware and\n\n516\n00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.700\nthe software.\n\n517\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.710\nAnd again,\njust pay attention to warranties,\n\n518\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.370\npay attention to the people that\nyou might have to send this to.\n\n519\n00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.779\nIf it's under warranty,\nsend it back to the manufacturer.\n\n520\n00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:27.507\nYou don't have to be the hero of the day,\nbecause hero could turn to zero really\n\n521\n00:28:27.507 --> 00:28:31.220\nquick, especially if you turn around and\nmess something up.\n\n522\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.860\nNow, we do have another episode coming\ndown the way, that's gonna talk about\n\n523\n00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.050\na little bit troubleshooting\nwhen it comes to these devices.\n\n524\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.360\nBut, I think this is a good\nplace to stop when it comes to\n\n525\n00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.100\njust knowing some of the basic components.\n\n526\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.351\n&gt;&gt; All right, great job Wes, we appreciate\nyou stopping by, and familiarizing us with\n\n527\n00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:49.024\nthe internals and maybe even some of\nthe externals of our laptop systems.\n\n528\n00:28:49.024 --> 00:28:51.459\nAnd hopefully now you guys\nare a little more up to speed on that.\n\n529\n00:28:51.459 --> 00:28:53.025\nAnd that will help you as, we say,\n\n530\n00:28:53.025 --> 00:28:56.800\nwe're gonna move into a troubleshooting\nepisode down the line a little bit.\n\n531\n00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.870\nThat being said, looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n532\n00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.313\nWe do thank you for joining us.\n\n533\n00:29:00.313 --> 00:29:03.573\n&gt;&gt; But signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel

00:00:06.459\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.734\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:12.253\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:13.485\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:16.705\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:19.824\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n9\n00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:23.651\nguess what, we're back for\nmore of our A+ series, the good old 22901.\n\n10\n00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:25.954\nDon't you just love,\nit's like an old warm sweater,\n\n11\n00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:28.130\nyou just put it on on\na cold cold winter day.\n\n12\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.990\nAnd joining us back in the studio to share\na cup of coffee and maybe teach us a thing\n\n13\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.880\nor two about this actual exam,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.220\nWes, how's it going today, man?\n\n15\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can definitely help\nyou out with the first one.\n\n16\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.210\nLet's hope I can be some of\nassistance on the latter part.\n\n17\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.010\nThat is right.\n\n18\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.900\nThis is the exam that goes on and\non again, my friend.\n\n19\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.410\nThat's right.\n\n20\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.730\nWell, we are moving into a topic that,\nreally, when it comes down to it,\n\n21\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.530\nmost of the components we've already\ntalked about, and discussed.\n\n22\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.430\nBut we are going to be talking about a\nlittle bit more about portability, right,\n\n23\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.100\nand as you've seen the title of this show,\nwe are going to be looking at,\n\n24\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.640\nwell, mobile devices.\n\n25\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.370\nAnd, when we talk about mobile devices,\nremember, we've already talked about,\n\n26\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.130\nfor instance, laptops, right.\n\n27\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.910\nWe said laptops,\nbig concern there is portability,\n\n28\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.630\nbattery life and thermal management.\n\n29\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.850\nWell, guess what, ladies and\ngentlemen, I gotta tell you,\n\n30\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.110\nit's not really any different when it\ncomes to your mobile devices, as well.\n\n31\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.695\nIn fact,\n\n32\n00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:23.328\nthey're a little bit less forgiving\nwhen it comes to thermal management.\n\n33\n00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:26.038\nAnd I guess you would\nsay your battery life.\n\n34\n00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:29.638\nThank goodness we have lithium\nion batteries today, so\n\n35\n00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:33.400\nwe still get a fairly good\nlongevity out of these devices.\n\n36\n00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.258\nSo, we are gonna work through a few of the\nobjectives here in our 22901 exam here.\n\n37\n00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:43.873\nAnd we're gonna talk about some of\nthe different things that you potentially\n\n38\n00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:45.195\ncould see.\n\n39\n00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:48.475\nSo let's go ahead and we will dive\nin to the very first component, and\n\n40\n00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.495\nwe are talking about tablets.\n\n41\n00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:55.045\nWell, I will tell you, tablets and\neven ultrabooks and notebooks today,\n\n42\n00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:58.995\nsometimes they kinda cross the line and\nthe line gets blurred and\n\n43\n00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:01.800\nwe're learning that shades of gray.\n\n44\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.020\nThere are many, many, many, many\ndifferent variants of grays, if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.590\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n46\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.210\nWell, when you talk about a tablet,\n\n47\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.720\nright, we have things like\nMicrosoft Surface Device, right.\n\n48\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.250\nAnd we,\n\n49\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.990\nin the laptop section we talked about\nwhat are known as two-in-one devices.\n\n50\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.530\nTwo in one is the fact that,\nwell, it could be a laptop and\n\n51\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.410\nyou could take the screen off, right?\n\n52\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.570\nYou can detach the screen and\nit becomes a tablet.\n\n53\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.390\nWell, guess what, you know what, Surface\ntablets allow you to do the same thing.\n\n54\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.030\nThe difference is you can, I dunno if\nyou can still disconnect them from their\n\n55\n00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.880\nkeyboards, but\nessentially you have a cover, right?\n\n56\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.400\nAnd they become two in one.\n\n57\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.888\nSo keep in mind that that line,\nit's not really clear,\n\n58\n00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:43.300\nit's not really clearly defined,\njust like my sentence there.\n\n59\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.565\nThe fact of which one is a tablet,\nwhich one is a notebook, so\n\n60\n00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:49.867\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n61\n00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:54.180\nNow, one of the things that's kinda unique\nto tablets are the screen sizes, right?\n\n62\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.662\nAnd they come in many different shapes and\nsizes, variants, if you will,\n\n63\n00:02:57.662 --> 00:03:00.980\nwill have seven-inch screens,\nnine-inch, eight-inch screens,\n\n64\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.630\nright up until eleven-inch screens right.\n\n65\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.780\nNine inch screens.\n\n66\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.190\nWe have 10.9, and\nthat's sort of a funky one there too.\n\n67\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.200\nBut if you go into places likes New Egg,\nand you're gonna buy one,\n\n68\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.400\nif you go out to some place like\nBest Buy or Office Depot, if you will.\n\n69\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.580\nGuys and girls, we are not endorsing any\none company, just understand that you got\n\n70\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.120\na lot of options out there when\nit comes to buying these devices.\n\n71\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.700\nNow, when we talk about the tablet, how\nmuch real estate, what are you going to\n\n72\n00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.340\nuse it for, will really dictate what\nkind of tablet screen size you get.\n\n73\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.888\nSo, for instance,\nlet me give you an example,\n\n74\n00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:38.242\nif you are only going to be reading things\nlike books on it, or PDFs, if you will.\n\n75\n00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:40.429\nYeah, you could probably get a PDF reader,\nbut\n\n76\n00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.128\nyou might want a little bit\nmore functionality than that.\n\n77\n00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:45.630\nSo a seven-inch screen might be just fine.\n\n78\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.300\nBut if you're gonna do a little bit more,\n\n79\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.380\nlet's say you are gonna\ntake this out on the road,\n\n80\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.410\nmaybe you're a telecommuter, maybe\nyou're also a travelling salesperson.\n\n81\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.130\nAnd you want to be able to\nwork with Excel spreadsheets,\n\n82\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.600\nyou want to work with some kind\nof Open Office-type product.\n\n83\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.380\nWell, you might want\na little more real estate so\n\n84\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.160\nmaybe you do want something\nlike an 11-inch tablet.\n\n85\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.990\nOr, if you're a gamer, a lot of these\ntablets, we'll talk about some of\n\n86\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.680\nthe CPU characteristics coming up,\na lot of these tablets are very powerful.\n\n87\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.960\nIn fact,\njust as powerful as a work station.\n\n88\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.310\nAnd they also integrate things like your\ngraphics processing units that allow you\n\n89\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.330\nto do some pretty darn good gaming when it\ncomes down to the quality of the output of\n\n90\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.890\nthe screen itself, so keep that in mind.\n\n91\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.670\nThe other characteristic of the screen\nis not only the size, if you will,\n\n92\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.680\nof that screen, but\nalso the technology that's behind it.\n\n93\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.522\nYou will see LED screens, right?\n\n94\n00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:36.310\nThey're ultra-thin, but\nmore commonly what you're seeing is\n\n95\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.160\nsome of the other screen types that\nwe've talked about in past episodes,\n\n96\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.990\nthat being your OLED screen, right?\n\n97\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.780\nYour organic light emitting diode.\n\n98\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.520\nNow, when it comes down to it,\nLCDs, LEDs, OLEDs,\n\n99\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.400\nthey're all using really\nthe same technology.\n\n100\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.330\nWhat it is is it's the lighting\nsource that changes just slightly.\n\n101\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.270\nRemember, the LCDs they use what are known\nas CCFLs, cold cathode fluorescent lamps,\n\n102\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.390\njust like we've got here in the studios.\n\n103\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.610\nThat's putting light on my face here,\nright.\n\n104\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.330\nThose are fluorescent bulbs.\n\n105\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.050\nSome of them are LEDs as well, right.\n\n106\n00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.610\nAnd that's when you move into the LEDs,\nreally,\n\n107\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.480\nit's the light emitting diode if you will.\n\n108\n00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.750\nIt's either a backlighting source, you may\nhave white emitting light, or white LEDs.\n\n109\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.070\nThey also have RGB LEDs.\n\n110\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.190\nBut like I said, more so\ntoday on these small\n\n111\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.300\nform factor devices with the fact that\nyou want less and less power consumption.\n\n112\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.535\nAnd that's what they're striving for\nand too,\n\n113\n00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:31.030\nultra-thin form factor, it's the fact that\nyou get the organic light emitting diode.\n\n114\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.350\nAnd again that's gonna\nstill use TFT screens,\n\n115\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.570\nthe thin film transistor screens that have\nseveral layers within it, but again it's\n\n116\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.430\nusing some kind of organic substance-\n&gt;&gt; Would be-\n\n117\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.140\n&gt;&gt; For the light source.\n\n118\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.830\n&gt;&gt; Would be kinda funny\nto see a CRT tablet.\n\n119\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.430\n&gt;&gt; That would be great.\n\n120\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.980\nThat would be great.\n\n121\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.715\n&gt;&gt; It only weighs 400 pounds.\n\n122\n00:05:45.715 --> 00:05:47.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You just took me back to the days of\n\n123\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.180\nMichael Jackson and the boombox,\nthat sits on your shoulder.\n\n124\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.890\nI got my tablet and I also got scoliosis.\n\n125\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.232\n&gt;&gt; Tablets from 1989.\n\n126\n00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:54.732\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n127\n00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:57.562\nAnd you can see, we joke about it, but\n\n128\n00:05:57.562 --> 00:06:00.690\nreally that's what it comes down to.\n\n129\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.448\nIn that ultra thin form factor.\n\n130\n00:06:02.448 --> 00:06:06.490\n&gt;&gt; I guess if we didn't have those\ntechnologies of having OLED, and LED and\n\n131\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.060\nTFT, we would not be able\nto have tablet technology.\n\n132\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.860\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n&gt;&gt; CRT would make that impossible,\n\n133\n00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.780\nit's just crazy.\n\n134\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.495\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:17.925\n&gt;&gt; And Dan, it's kinda interesting that\nyou're seeing more of this in, for\n\n136\n00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:20.380\ninstance your home environments too.\n\n137\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.410\nThey got those ultra high-definition TVs,\nthat are just gargantuan in size but\n\n138\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.400\nyet they're half of an inch thick or\nless, really, when it comes down to it.\n\n139\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.480\nThey're almost getting to\nwhere they're flimsy and\n\n140\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.350\nwe have seen some kind of\nprototype technologies out there.\n\n141\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.743\nI know you're a tech geek like I am,\n\n142\n00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:39.410\nDan where you come across your Flipboard\nfeeds or something your news feeds, where\n\n143\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.390\nit literally is, it's a screen that's\nalmost as flimsy as a piece of paper.\n\n144\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.770\nSo they're getting really, really thin.\n\n145\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're talking about\nputting them on as labels for\n\n146\n00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:49.902\ncans because it's getting so cheap.\n\n147\n00:06:49.902 --> 00:06:53.864\nAnd the power efficiency on\nthem is insanely good, so\n\n148\n00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:56.250\nwe can wrap it around a soda can.\n\n149\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.370\nNow you got a Pepsi can that moves and\ndoes things.\n\n150\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.830\nMaybe even advertises itself.\n\n151\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.870\nIt's really interesting where\nthey're going with this.\n\n152\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know what, Mike?\n\n153\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.370\nTo expand a little bit,\nyou made a good comment there.\n\n154\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.330\nIt's getting cheap, right?\n\n155\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n156\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.670\n&gt;&gt; The more the price comes down,\nright, remember, smaller, faster,\n\n157\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.700\nless power consumption,\nand cheaper, right.\n\n158\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.360\nThat's where you're gonna see the\nprevalence of these technologies more and\n\n159\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.320\nmore and more, right.\n\n160\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.980\nI remember, and\nI'm kinda aging myself here.\n\n161\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.330\nI remember growing up in the 90s and\nstuff,\n\n162\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.220\nwhen the grunge rock scene was everything.\n\n163\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.270\nAnd I walked into\na Circuit City at the time,\n\n164\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.030\nand I remember seeing the plasma\nTV that was up on the wall.\n\n165\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.309\nAnd it was still, I mean we're still\ntalking, this thick and it was $15,000.\n\n166\n00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:43.150\n$15,000 for something today that you can\ngo into even your average retail store,\n\n167\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.210\nand buy for less than five hundred bucks,\nthat 55-inch screen TV.\n\n168\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.060\nSo again, I'm glad you mentioned,\nyou know, just the cost, right.\n\n169\n00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.010\nThey're getting more cost-effective.\n\n170\n00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.205\nBringing the scalability down,\nwhich really lends itself to a lot of\n\n171\n00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:59.488\ncompetition that ultimately,\nyou as the consumer can benefit from.\n\n172\n00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:03.849\nNow, I mentioned just briefly, I mentioned\nabout the CPUs right, the, you know,\n\n173\n00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.455\nthe central processing unit.\n\n174\n00:08:05.455 --> 00:08:08.721\nLadies and gentlemen, we and Den,\nI believe you in this episode with me as\n\n175\n00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.950\nwell, as we kinda taking\nthis journey together.\n\n176\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.881\nWe talked about the characteristics of\nthe central processing units, right.\n\n177\n00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:17.130\nGo back and watch those shows.\n\n178\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.410\nBut I do wanna just talk briefly\nabout mobile devices, the CPUs.\n\n179\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.500\nBecause there are some characteristics,\n\n180\n00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.510\nthat they share some of\nthe characteristics of a work station or\n\n181\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.180\na server that are unique to\nthe tablets themselves, as well.\n\n182\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.810\nRight, when we talk about CPUs,\n\n183\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.920\nthere are multi core processors just\nlike you have in your work stations.\n\n184\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.080\nHowever, remember with\npower consumption and\n\n185\n00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.780\nbattery life it's really about\nhow low powered they can get.\n\n186\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.300\nStill giving you the capabilities, the\nperformance that you need, but using multi\n\n187\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.830\nvoltage positioning or SpeedStep\ntechnologies, PowerNow if it's in AMD.\n\n188\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.420\nAgain Intel versus AMD,\n\n189\n00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.950\nand it's really about being able\nto save the battery life, right?\n\n190\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.250\nBecause yeah,\nwe can make these tablets completely,\n\n191\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.640\nreally powerful and they already are and\nthey're doing a great job.\n\n192\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.560\nBut when you turn them on they dim\nthe lights two blocks over, right,\n\n193\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.130\nand they have a battery\nlife of about ten seconds.\n\n194\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.650\nSo keep in mind that that's one of the big\ncharacteristics that are a little bit\n\n195\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.080\ndifferent in mobile devices, right?\n\n196\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.182\nAnd they use what are known as SOCs,\nsystem on a chip Intel coined\n\n197\n00:09:20.182 --> 00:09:23.233\nthe phrase that we talked about\nin another episode called SIP.\n\n198\n00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:26.129\nApparently, there's a new thing\ncalled system in a package, and\n\n199\n00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:29.662\nagain it's just the fact that you have\neverything built into the chips, right?\n\n200\n00:09:29.662 --> 00:09:34.395\nIntel is really, really good at this, and\nwe're gonna talk about Intel and AMD, and\n\n201\n00:09:34.395 --> 00:09:38.561\nladies and gentlemen we're not here to\nget into a debate intel versus AMD.\n\n202\n00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:43.493\nYou have people on both sides of the\ntrack, and I will tell you that Intel does\n\n203\n00:09:43.493 --> 00:09:47.750\ncertain things, much better than\nan AMD and even on the AMD side.\n\n204\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.190\nThere are certain things that the AMD\nchips do that the Intel chips do not\n\n205\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.620\ndo as well, all right?\n\n206\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.600\nSo what am I talking about?\n\n207\n00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.950\nIntel chips, if you need graphics and\ngraphics performance,\n\n208\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.160\nyou're not going to get the same kind of\ngraphics performance out of an Intel chip,\n\n209\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.170\nthat you are gonna get out of an AMD chip.\n\n210\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.237\nNow that being said,\nwhen it comes to sheer processing power,\n\n211\n00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:11.685\nAMD's not gonna do it.\n\n212\n00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:18.230\nIf you need straight streamed calculation\nand a great multithreading processor.\n\n213\n00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.410\nIntel for a long time and\nstill today excels the market, right?\n\n214\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.120\nSo, if I have a tablet that I need to\ndo more computational heavy things,\n\n215\n00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.020\nI'm gonna get an Intel.\n\n216\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.030\nNow that means said,\n\n217\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.220\nam I saying stay away from an Intel\nbased tablet if you want gaming?\n\n218\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.070\nNot at all, not at all am I\nsaying that because you know what\n\n219\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.810\nIntel they're very clever, right?\n\n220\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.380\nThat's one of the reasons\nthey been on a market so\n\n221\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.200\nlong is because you integrated with\na nice graphics processing unit.\n\n222\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.560\nAnd now you've got the best of both,\n\n223\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.740\nyou've got just superior processing power\nand you've got good graphics too, right?\n\n224\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.779\nNow AMD have what are known as APU's,\n\n225\n00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.978\nand this is just a clever way\nof marketing a new technology.\n\n226\n00:10:57.978 --> 00:11:01.226\nOr making it seem like it's a new\ntechnology but it's been around for\n\n227\n00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:04.250\na while,\nit's called accelerated processing unit.\n\n228\n00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.970\nNow one of the reason's they're a little\nbit better at the graphics side is because\n\n229\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.920\nthey will embed GPU's,\nright into the die of the chip.\n\n230\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.490\nAnother reason Intel's are better at\nthe sheer processing power is cuz,\n\n231\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.810\nnot only can they do that, but they can\nalso endue embed their memory controllers,\n\n232\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.330\nright into the die of the chip.\n\n233\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.960\nNow, how does that benefit you and\nthe processing power?\n\n234\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.020\nRemember, if I take a memory controller\nand I take it off of the PCB and\n\n235\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.200\nI stick it in the CPU,\nit gets to that data a lot faster.\n\n236\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.119\nSo again guys and gals out there,\nwe can debate back and\n\n237\n00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:36.181\nforth which ones are better.\n\n238\n00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:40.034\nHowever, both of them, for me and my\npurposes, depends on what you need to do,\n\n239\n00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:42.347\nI think both of them have\ntheir good qualities.\n\n240\n00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:45.506\nAnd I really don't think\nthey have bad qualities,\n\n241\n00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:48.820\ndepending on given the right situation,\nall right.\n\n242\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.540\nSo what am I talking\nabout when I say Intel?\n\n243\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.360\nI wanna talk about really just three\ndifferent kinds, and you really\n\n244\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.282\ncould boil it down to the iSeries, and\nwhat's known as the Core M, all right?\n\n245\n00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:01.350\nThe iSeries we see in our work stations,\nright?\n\n246\n00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.790\nWe see the i3, i5, i7, I'm talking\nabout the same type of processors.\n\n247\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.830\nHowever, keep in mind\nthat they've got advanced\n\n248\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.850\nspeed step technology that allows\nthem to throttle themselves.\n\n249\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.522\nThrottling is the reduction of the voltage\nto reduce the processing power, but\n\n250\n00:12:16.522 --> 00:12:18.834\nextends the battery life, all right?\n\n251\n00:12:18.834 --> 00:12:22.002\nAnd the other thing too is\nwhen you throttle a processor,\n\n252\n00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:24.200\nyou bring down the heat, right?\n\n253\n00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.530\nAnd that's another thing that\nmobile devices have to have.\n\n254\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.560\nCore M is an amazing Intel processor,\nlet me tell you some of the features so\n\n255\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.040\nyou guys can understand that again we're\nnot picking on one over the other,\n\n256\n00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.850\nlike Core M.\n\n257\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.000\nThis is a dual core multi\nthreaded processor so\n\n258\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.670\nyou get superior processing capabilities,\nit's an ultra, ultra low voltage, right?\n\n259\n00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:52.590\nExtended battery life, it is\na fanless passive cooling technology.\n\n260\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.230\npassive cooling meaning I\nwill have a heat sync and\n\n261\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.250\nprobably some kind of heat exchange\npiping, but I don't have a fan, right.\n\n262\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.940\nSo ultra low voltage, fanless,\npassive cooling, very,\n\n263\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.630\nvery small slimline form factors\ncan use something like this.\n\n264\n00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.504\n64 bit processing, we're not talking\n32 bit, we're talking all 64 so again,\n\n265\n00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:18.061\nremember what we're talking\nabout a lot of processing power.\n\n266\n00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:23.160\n64 bits being piped into that processor,\nbig old bits of information if you will.\n\n267\n00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.885\nBites of information being\nchewed off at one time, right?\n\n268\n00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:29.680\nIntel VT technology, so\n\n269\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.460\nnow we have a mobile processor that also\nsupports virtualization, how cool is that?\n\n270\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.370\nAlso as well, the NX bit, right?\n\n271\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.950\nThe NX bit is no execute,\nsecurity related technology, right?\n\n272\n00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.893\nThe fact that Intel knows how to\nquarantine a piece of memory, so\n\n273\n00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:48.679\nthat code execution can't happen, right?\n\n274\n00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.579\nThat's very,\n\n275\n00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:54.429\nvery important in today's mobile markets\nbecause of social media and the trend for\n\n276\n00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:58.810\nmalware to be propagated by all of\nthe different social apps that you like.\n\n277\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.479\nSo another great thing, all right?\n\n278\n00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:03.249\nNow remember that I told you that Intel,\n\n279\n00:14:03.249 --> 00:14:06.845\nyou're not probably not\ngonna go to Intel for a GPU.\n\n280\n00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.971\nMobile M integrates the GPU and\n\n281\n00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:14.640\nthe memory controller into a single\nprocessor, into the single chip.\n\n282\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.250\nSo okay, again, a great technology.\n\n283\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.860\nNow moving into the AMD site.\n\n284\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.580\nAMD, they have their A-series, right?\n\n285\n00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.550\nA common one out there is A4 and\nA10, they call them APUs, right?\n\n286\n00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.620\nAccelerated Processing Unit,\nthey do the same thing.\n\n287\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:37.320\nThey're a great processor for GPUs,\nGraphics Processing Unit, right?\n\n288\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.810\nApple isn't out of the woodworks\non this one either.\n\n289\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.520\nApple has some great products too.\n\n290\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.470\nThey've got their A-series processors.\n\n291\n00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.539\nNow, a little bit different here,\nwe're not talking about A4 and A10, right?\n\n292\n00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:49.960\nWe're talking about, I guess we kinda are,\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n293\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.030\nAMD has AMD A4, and then we have Apple's\nA4, which is one of the older ones that\n\n294\n00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.630\nwould have been found in things like\niPods, the earliest iPhones, and stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.769\n&gt;&gt; That's not confusing, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not confusing at all, but\n\n296\n00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:05.560\nthe great thing is that after that it gets\na little bit easier cuz they're up to A9X.\n\n297\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.264\nThey don't have an A10 yet,\nwhen they got A10,\n\n298\n00:15:07.264 --> 00:15:09.172\n[CROSSTALK] we're just gonna\nbe really confused, right.\n\n299\n00:15:09.172 --> 00:15:11.840\nAnd you can usually see that there better\n\n300\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.230\npro line processors have\nan x on the end of them.\n\n301\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:20.243\nSo, let me give you an example,\nA5 normal Apple processor A5X,\n\n302\n00:15:20.243 --> 00:15:24.330\nkinda like if you could take of like\nIntel does with their extreme processors,\n\n303\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.370\nthey usually have an X after it, right?\n\n304\n00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:32.300\nAll the way up to the A9X currently 2017\nhere, that we're shooting this in July,\n\n305\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.080\nthat's in the iPad Pro, the bigger iPad\nthat's perfect for businesses and stuff,\n\n306\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.150\nso they have theirs as well, all right?\n\n307\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.986\nThen there's a little\ncompany called Qualcomm.\n\n308\n00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:45.060\nQualcomm has your snapdragons.\n\n309\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.330\nYou see your snapdragons in your\nandroid phones I think Dan's got a new\n\n310\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.680\nSamsung phone over there, I would almost\nbe willing to guess it's Qualcomm\n\n311\n00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.920\nprocessor and probably even the snapdragon\nif I had, if I had to guess, right?\n\n312\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.878\nVery good processor especially,\ntheir Snapdragon Pro.\n\n313\n00:15:59.878 --> 00:16:02.940\nThis is one that's not only good for,\n\n314\n00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.785\njust general level of processing,\nit gives you superior graphics too.\n\n315\n00:16:08.785 --> 00:16:11.415\nThat is consistent across the board,\nright?\n\n316\n00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:14.701\nIt is consistent across Intel,\nit's consistent across AMD,\n\n317\n00:16:14.701 --> 00:16:17.560\nit's consistent across\nthings like Qualcomm.\n\n318\n00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.000\nIs it?\nAll right, so Dan's got my back over here,\n\n319\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.940\nhe's over there hitting the Google, right?\n\n320\n00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.130\nHitting those keys.\n\n321\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.100\n&gt;&gt; It's a Snapdragon 835.\n\n322\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.413\n&gt;&gt; All right, 835, very good.\n\n323\n00:16:26.413 --> 00:16:29.294\nSo again, low voltage,\nvery good processor, great,\n\n324\n00:16:29.294 --> 00:16:31.269\nyou find them in a lot of your devices.\n\n325\n00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:34.850\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, those\nare just some of them out there, right?\n\n326\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.051\nJust understand that there\nare many different processors,\n\n327\n00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:39.315\nmany different kinds.\n\n328\n00:16:39.315 --> 00:16:42.160\nI just mentioned some of\nthe big ones here that we see.\n\n329\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.590\nAgain, Intel, obviously,\n\n330\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:49.370\nthe biggest processing company since,\ngosh, the late 40s really.\n\n331\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.250\nAMD's another, Advanced Micro Devices.\n\n332\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.806\nApple's proprietary A series which,\nI say proprietary,\n\n333\n00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:57.727\nI think it's actually made by\nSamsung which is kinda interesting.\n\n334\n00:16:57.727 --> 00:17:01.937\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And another one being Qualcomm.\n\n335\n00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:05.205\nAll right, so moving into some of\nthe other technologies, I said, hey,\n\n336\n00:17:05.205 --> 00:17:08.387\nlet's not get hung up on CPUs and\nI just spent about ten minutes on CPUs.\n\n337\n00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:09.653\n&gt;&gt; You got hung up on CPUs.\n\n338\n00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:10.917\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it happens.\n\n339\n00:17:10.917 --> 00:17:11.966\n&gt;&gt; You got a real problem, Wess.\n\n340\n00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:12.585\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n341\n00:17:12.585 --> 00:17:13.530\n&gt;&gt; You're going to need some help.\n\n342\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.480\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\nI hear they've got programs for that.\n\n343\n00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.400\nIt's a 13 step program though, it has to\ngo a little farther, but joking aside,\n\n344\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.585\nguys and gals out there.\n\n345\n00:17:21.585 --> 00:17:23.218\nSmartphones, right?\n\n346\n00:17:23.218 --> 00:17:26.212\nSmartphones are just as powerful\nas workstations, mobile devices,\n\n347\n00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.438\nlaptops that we have today.\n\n348\n00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:31.123\nIn fact, the one that I'm kinda\nreferencing over there that Dan has is\n\n349\n00:17:31.123 --> 00:17:32.520\na very good phone, okay?\n\n350\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.605\nI think I kind of got a phone\nenvy in the background there.\n\n351\n00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:37.849\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting there is a,\nthey have, it's called a deck or decks or\n\n352\n00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.580\nsomething like that,\nthat you can get with it.\n\n353\n00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.189\nPlug it in it,\nUSB connects to your monitor,\n\n354\n00:17:43.189 --> 00:17:45.259\nbecomes a full blown work station.\n\n355\n00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:45.987\n&gt;&gt; I can see that.\n\n356\n00:17:45.987 --> 00:17:46.771\n&gt;&gt; It's very cool.\n\n357\n00:17:46.771 --> 00:17:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely can see that because of the\npower that's in these little guys here.\n\n358\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.405\nSo some of the manufactures, and again\nthere are so many manufacturers of cell\n\n359\n00:17:54.405 --> 00:17:58.090\nphones out there, I just want to mention\na couple of the top ones, right?\n\n360\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.324\nApple and Samsung obviously, they\nare the big guys always duking it out.\n\n361\n00:18:01.324 --> 00:18:05.970\nAnd keep in mind LG is one\nof the other ones out there.\n\n362\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.660\nSo, those are just some of\nthe big ones that I can think of.\n\n363\n00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.910\nIf you were to do a Google search right\nnow, we could have a half hour episode in\n\n364\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.560\njust how many different\nmanufacturers are out there.\n\n365\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.409\nI could mention Nokia, but\nBlackberry and all, but\n\n366\n00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:21.834\nthose are really the three big ones that\nwe have out there Apple, Samsung and LG.\n\n367\n00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.109\nWearable technologies.\n\n368\n00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:26.608\nWell, wearable technologies,\nyou probably could see these,\n\n369\n00:18:26.608 --> 00:18:28.304\nyou probably have seen these.\n\n370\n00:18:28.304 --> 00:18:30.892\nThe biggest one being the smart watches,\nright?\n\n371\n00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:33.410\nSmart watches are kinda\ninteresting because guess what,\n\n372\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.740\nthey also have multi-core functionality,\nright?\n\n373\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.140\nDual core GPUs, they have on board memory,\non board storage if you will.\n\n374\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.570\nSome of the examples are the Apple Watch\none and two, different variants and\n\n375\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.515\nit depends on when you're watching this\nbecause by the time you're watching this,\n\n376\n00:18:47.515 --> 00:18:49.200\nthere might be the Apple Watch three,\nright?\n\n377\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.184\nSamsung Gear has their S2, S3.\n\n378\n00:18:52.184 --> 00:18:56.880\nAgain, numerically you can figure out\nwhich one's older and which one's newer.\n\n379\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.940\nLG, they have a couple of different\nstyles too, they got the LG watch,\n\n380\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.984\none called Style and\none called Sport, right?\n\n381\n00:19:01.984 --> 00:19:02.925\nSo LG has theirs.\n\n382\n00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:06.624\nASUS or ASUS, however we say that,\nI still don't really\n\n383\n00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:10.840\nknow how you're supposed to\npronounce that, I just say ASUS.\n\n384\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.850\nHas ZenWatch and they have the different\nrevisions and versions two and\n\n385\n00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.570\nthree as of the time of\nthis recording as well.\n\n386\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.490\nAnd again, smart watches allow you\nthe ability to interact with your phone,\n\n387\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.080\nthey almost act like phones and stuff.\n\n388\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.560\nYou can receive text messages, receive\nyour e-mail, you can monitor things like\n\n389\n00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.830\nyour heart rate, right,\nthey can be pedometers and stuff.\n\n390\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.345\nWhich leads us into fitness monitors,\nright?\n\n391\n00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:34.930\nFitBit is a common one that you\nprobably heard about there,\n\n392\n00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.380\nand FitBit has a couple of\ndifferent kinds as well, right?\n\n393\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.181\nThey've got the flex and\n\n394\n00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:40.407\nthey've got the charge,\njust to kinda give you guys some examples.\n\n395\n00:19:40.407 --> 00:19:44.363\nAnd if you're not familiar with these,\nthen I would recommend pausing this video\n\n396\n00:19:44.363 --> 00:19:48.390\nand doing a Google search just like Dan's\ndoing in the background for me right now.\n\n397\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.480\nJust hey, what is this?\n\n398\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.300\nBoom, well, let's Google it,\nlet's kinda find out, all right?\n\n399\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.357\nGarmin or Garmin, I don't know if\nthat's how you pronounce that.\n\n400\n00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:56.950\n&gt;&gt; Garmin.\n\n401\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.920\n&gt;&gt; Garmin, thank you.\n\n402\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.450\nMisfit one and two, and\nagain just different revisions of there.\n\n403\n00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.380\nThey're little fitness monitors.\n\n404\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.034\nHow about things like VR?\n\n405\n00:20:08.034 --> 00:20:12.765\nVR is very, very prevalent today and\npopular when it comes to coupling\n\n406\n00:20:12.765 --> 00:20:16.869\nthese up with a wireless\nconnection to your phones, right?\n\n407\n00:20:16.869 --> 00:20:18.375\nYour cell phones.\n\n408\n00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:22.940\nGoogle Cardboard's one of the ones\nthat you maybe recognize right away.\n\n409\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.170\nGoogle Glass out there, I happen to have\none that's called the Daydream view.\n\n410\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.073\nI got that with my Google Pixel.\n\n411\n00:20:30.073 --> 00:20:34.190\nSamsung's got their Gear VR as well,\nanother popular one there as well.\n\n412\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.750\nI think that one couples with Dan's\nphone over there, the Galaxy Samsung 8.\n\n413\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.319\nMerger view, again, there's a lot\nof the third party ones there that\n\n414\n00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:48.820\naren't necessarily like the same\nmanufacturer as the cellphone, right?\n\n415\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.850\nSo you can have those and\n\n416\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:54.580\nyou can pair those up with them but\npay attention to the manufacturers.\n\n417\n00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.082\nAll right, so a couple of the last things\nthat I want to just kind of mention here.\n\n418\n00:20:58.082 --> 00:21:00.986\nWe talk about phablets, right?\n\n419\n00:21:00.986 --> 00:21:05.355\nAnd phablet is interesting because you can\nthink of like the Galaxy Notes as being\n\n420\n00:21:05.355 --> 00:21:08.694\nkind of like a phablet,\nwhere in the fact that it's a phone and\n\n421\n00:21:08.694 --> 00:21:10.240\nit's a tablet, right?\n\n422\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.570\nAnd some people might\nsay that something like,\n\n423\n00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.400\nI've got the Google Pixel XL here, right?\n\n424\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.349\nAnd you can see that well, essentially,\nI mean it's a pretty big phone, right?\n\n425\n00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:26.003\nAnd you do have those,\nthey're all different kinds,\n\n426\n00:21:26.003 --> 00:21:29.110\nthey actually market\nunder the term phablet.\n\n427\n00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.714\nLike Indigi has one, Pumpkin's Inteva\nis one, Lenovo has theirs, and\n\n428\n00:21:33.714 --> 00:21:36.144\nthere is a ton of other ones out there.\n\n429\n00:21:36.144 --> 00:21:39.956\nAnd again, really, we're just talking\nabout taking the functionality of a tablet\n\n430\n00:21:39.956 --> 00:21:42.746\nand a cell phone, and again,\na lot of shades of grey out here,\n\n431\n00:21:42.746 --> 00:21:46.399\nwhen you blur the lines here, you're just\ntalking about one that's bigger than\n\n432\n00:21:46.399 --> 00:21:48.090\nthe smaller form factor cell phone.\n\n433\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.400\n&gt;&gt; I actually took my, I have a Note 4,\nthat was my previous phone.\n\n434\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.270\nI gave it to my daughter, who is three,\nand it works great as a tablet for her,\n\n435\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.540\nbecause it's so dang big.\n\n436\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's great, that's great, well,\n\n437\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.240\nrepurposing too, and that's another\nthing that's kinda good about these.\n\n438\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.190\nMy wife and I,\nas of the recording of this, we're\n\n439\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.080\nhoping to get into a new house, and I was\nlooking at some of the old electronics,\n\n440\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.920\nand boy I have a lot of them,\njust ask her.\n\n441\n00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.075\nActually, don't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n442\n00:22:13.075 --> 00:22:13.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n443\n00:22:13.701 --> 00:22:16.330\nthey make great MP3 players.\n\n444\n00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.753\nLike you were saying repurpose them,\n\n445\n00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.980\nso don't just throw them\naway if you got them.\n\n446\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.500\nYou can have a lot of fun with them\nin a lot of creative ways that you\n\n447\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.410\ncan kinda DIY, and use them for\nother purposes too.\n\n448\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.550\nE-readers, these are a little bit\nmore basic than your tablets.\n\n449\n00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.700\nA little less functionality, but\nthen again, cheaper in price, right?\n\n450\n00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.600\nThey have touch screens, Wi-Fi, they\ncould use cellular communication, GSM,\n\n451\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.500\nCDMA, as well.\n\n452\n00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.740\nThey also have the ability to\ndo extended memory card support.\n\n453\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.410\nSo, if you wanna keep more of your PDFs or\n\n454\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.450\nmore of, Kindle's one of them that\nthey have out there, right, a Kindle.\n\n455\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.190\nI don't know if Barnes and Noble's is,\nI think they're still selling the Kindles.\n\n456\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.354\nBut that's one that comes\nto the top of my mind.\n\n457\n00:22:56.354 --> 00:22:58.222\n&gt;&gt; Barnes and\nNoble's was the NOOK, wasn't it?\n\n458\n00:22:58.222 --> 00:23:00.415\n&gt;&gt; It was the NOOK, it's Amazon Kindle.\n\n459\n00:23:00.415 --> 00:23:01.655\nThank you very much, that's right.\n\n460\n00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:02.585\nBarnes and Noble, NOOK.\n\n461\n00:23:02.585 --> 00:23:04.325\nI actually got one of these\nwhen I first came out.\n\n462\n00:23:04.325 --> 00:23:05.472\nFirst thing I did was rooted it.\n\n463\n00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:07.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Put a different operating system on it\n\n464\n00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.032\nand-\n&gt;&gt; And it never worked again.\n\n465\n00:23:08.032 --> 00:23:11.157\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, shoo, you remember?\n\n466\n00:23:11.157 --> 00:23:12.164\n[LAUGH] So, and again,\n\n467\n00:23:12.164 --> 00:23:15.346\nbasic functionality,\nsometimes they're color interface, right?\n\n468\n00:23:15.346 --> 00:23:19.016\nAnd sometimes they have a color screen,\nsometimes they just have a basic,\n\n469\n00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:20.600\nthe old black and white screen.\n\n470\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.660\nAnd again, it's for just basic\nfunctionality being able to read PDFs,\n\n471\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.820\njust being able to read electronic\nformat based books that can be delivered\n\n472\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.270\nover a Wi-Fi network\nstraight to the device.\n\n473\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.000\nI've seen many people on flights and stuff\nwhere you have somebody that maybe is\n\n474\n00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.460\na little bit older, and I'm not picking on\nanybody that's older when you say that, so\n\n475\n00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.600\ndon't send me the hate mail, but somebody\nthat's maybe not so tech savvy and\n\n476\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.860\nwants to still be able to read a book.\n\n477\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.910\nWell, I can't even get into this darn\ntablet or begin to tell you what to do.\n\n478\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.630\nBut I know that when I press the power\nbutton, and I press one button,\n\n479\n00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.700\nI can actually read through my books,\nand I can do that while I'm on a flight.\n\n480\n00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.536\nSo they have their benefits too, right?\n\n481\n00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:57.550\nThey're great for\nthings like photo viewers,\n\n482\n00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.705\nnews feeds, maybe even just a simple\nchecking of your email too.\n\n483\n00:24:01.705 --> 00:24:04.428\nAll right, what else do we got here,\nDan, smart cameras?\n\n484\n00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:08.300\nSmart cameras, keep in mind,\nthese are really cool, right.\n\n485\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.718\nAnd I know you're into photography too, so\nthis one's probably right up your alley.\n\n486\n00:24:11.718 --> 00:24:14.630\nThey have built-in WiFi,\na touch interface,\n\n487\n00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.150\nthey synchronize with the cloud today.\n\n488\n00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.780\nSo where I'm taking my photos, right?\n\n489\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.550\nMemory, storage, right?\n\n490\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.790\nStorage can get chewed up really,\n\n491\n00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.030\nreally quick especially when you're\ntalking about anything high definition.\n\n492\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.150\nAnd I don't care if you're talking about\na PC, a tablet, a mobile phone, or\n\n493\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.400\na smart camera.\n\n494\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.520\nImaging the ability when\nyou take that shot,\n\n495\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.610\nthat snapshot of your kids, right,\nthat you just don't wanna lose, right, or\n\n496\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.250\nI don't even care,\nit could be a flower for all that matters.\n\n497\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.500\nGoes right up,\nsynchronizes right up to the Cloud, right.\n\n498\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:48.740\nSend photos, and videos straight\nto social media, again, as well as\n\n499\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.884\nusing media based, over your own network,\nsending it to your media servers too.\n\n500\n00:24:53.895 --> 00:24:55.665\nGPS, we've talked about GPS.\n\n501\n00:24:55.665 --> 00:24:58.445\nSo we get into some of the connection\ntypes that you can also see here with\n\n502\n00:24:58.445 --> 00:24:59.185\nmobile devices.\n\n503\n00:24:59.185 --> 00:25:03.705\nGPS is not so much a connection type as it\nis more of a technology that's out there,\n\n504\n00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:04.915\nthe Global Positioning System.\n\n505\n00:25:04.915 --> 00:25:09.460\nAs a recap, remember 24 satellites\nare in orbit right now and\n\n506\n00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.880\n3 of those will triangulate,\n\n507\n00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.620\nat any given point in time, to kind of\ngive you a pinpoint position, right?\n\n508\n00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.745\nHence the term global positioning system.\n\n509\n00:25:17.745 --> 00:25:20.572\nThree of those are on standby\nin case they need to service or\n\n510\n00:25:20.572 --> 00:25:23.803\nbring one offline, the other one\ncan pick up where the failed one or\n\n511\n00:25:23.803 --> 00:25:25.953\nthe one that's being serviced is left off.\n\n512\n00:25:25.953 --> 00:25:30.123\nSome of the other connection types\nthat we have near field communication,\n\n513\n00:25:30.123 --> 00:25:34.557\nremember a very, very short range\ntechnology, we're talking centimeters,\n\n514\n00:25:34.557 --> 00:25:39.056\ninches depending on which system you\nfollow where you can actually send photos,\n\n515\n00:25:39.056 --> 00:25:42.101\npictures, files just by\ntouching devices together,\n\n516\n00:25:42.101 --> 00:25:46.640\nprint jobs if you end up having\na NFC enabled printing technology.\n\n517\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.210\nThere are different proprietary\nvendor specific ports as well,\n\n518\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:55.150\na lightning connector is an example\nof one that is proprietary.\n\n519\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.840\nOne of the things that I like about,\nand again, not cutting on Apple, but\n\n520\n00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.350\none of the things that I like about a lot\nof the Android devices is the fact that\n\n521\n00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:08.410\nthey use your typical micro USB, whether\nis be the C which is a newer one or\n\n522\n00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:13.575\nwhether it be like the micro USB A or\nB connectors.\n\n523\n00:26:13.575 --> 00:26:16.540\nAnd what's great about that\nis the chargers, if you will,\n\n524\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.190\nthey're consistent across the board.\n\n525\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.420\nI can grab that charger that,\nhey, I got a new device but\n\n526\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.800\nI still have this charger and\nI can connect it.\n\n527\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.449\n&gt;&gt; Wes, if we wanted to cut up on Apple,\n\n528\n00:26:25.449 --> 00:26:28.028\nwe would talk about how they\nremoved the headphone jack.\n\n529\n00:26:28.028 --> 00:26:31.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right and\n\n530\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.930\nin their defense it's because\nthey're going to USBC.\n\n531\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.944\nAnd they're going to USBC which can do\naudio, video, and it can do power and\n\n532\n00:26:38.944 --> 00:26:39.585\nethernet.\n\n533\n00:26:39.585 --> 00:26:44.158\nSo, again, there's goods and bads but\nsome of you out there, kind of like me,\n\n534\n00:26:44.158 --> 00:26:48.325\nI like that one-eighth inch jack that\nI can just plug headphones into and\n\n535\n00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:49.513\nI know it's there.\n\n536\n00:26:49.513 --> 00:26:51.600\n&gt;&gt; That I already have and\nhave spent money on.\n\n537\n00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.567\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Dan spent some money,\nand he's very frugal with his money.\n\n538\n00:26:55.567 --> 00:26:59.190\nAnd he doesn't wanna get\nrid of those old headsets.\n\n539\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.285\nAnd you know this happens\nin the Android world too.\n\n540\n00:27:02.285 --> 00:27:05.720\nIn fact I just recently got rid\nof an old tablet that I had.\n\n541\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.037\nIt is nice this tablet and\n\n542\n00:27:07.037 --> 00:27:11.199\nit had a proprietary 15 pin connector\nlike the earlier iPad connectors too.\n\n543\n00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:15.300\nAnd you had to get just that one,\nI mean you had to go to them.\n\n544\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.300\nSo you do have the proprietary\npower connectors and\n\n545\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.730\neven sometimes communication\nconnectors to our ports too.\n\n546\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.070\nWe've mentioned micro USB,\nthe smallest of the ones.\n\n547\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.640\nGuys go back and\nlook at our ports and connections,\n\n548\n00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.600\nremember in micro and mini USB,\nI mentioned the lightning connector.\n\n549\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.309\nRemember, Bluetooth is another connector.\n\n550\n00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:39.030\nAnd we talked about these\ntechnologies a bunch in other series.\n\n551\n00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.220\nHeadsets, we kinda just mentioned that,\nright?\n\n552\n00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.695\nSpeaker connections, potentially sometimes\nyou can see speaker connections really,\n\n553\n00:27:45.695 --> 00:27:50.745\nwhen you have a micro HDMI connector\nthat actually connects from the port\n\n554\n00:27:50.745 --> 00:27:53.485\non the device out to a television.\n\n555\n00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:54.717\nGame pads.\n\n556\n00:27:54.717 --> 00:27:57.805\nDan's already mentioned the docking\nstations, that you can buy,\n\n557\n00:27:57.805 --> 00:28:00.960\nEssentially turning your phone\ninto a full blown computer, right?\n\n558\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.270\nThey also have docking stations,\n\n559\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.250\nwhich are in the things like\nthe two in ones as well.\n\n560\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.030\nExtra battery packs and battery chargers.\n\n561\n00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.970\nBattery packs, if you will,\nkeep in mind, you have power banks.\n\n562\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.650\nYou can also have extra batteries.\n\n563\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:19.440\nI actually have an Anker battery pack,\nif you will, and\n\n564\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.350\nit allows me to charge three\nphones simultaneously.\n\n565\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.540\nAnd it can do 2 full iPad recharges so\nIt's an extended life,\n\n566\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.380\nI absolutely love it.\n\n567\n00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.717\nThey also make small ones, right?\n\n568\n00:28:28.717 --> 00:28:32.200\nThey give you one charge or 75% charge,\na little stick it looks like and\n\n569\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.470\nyou could plug into it, it's great for\nwhen you're travelling.\n\n570\n00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.530\nBattery chargers.\n\n571\n00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.350\nAgain, two,\n\n572\n00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.120\nyou can have extras, keep in mind that\nif you are in a mobile environment,\n\n573\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.780\nthat's why we're talking about mobile\ndevices, it is a good idea to have them.\n\n574\n00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.460\nProtective covers.\n\n575\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.805\nYou have a very expensive device.\n\n576\n00:28:47.805 --> 00:28:50.121\nYour devices could be $900, right?\n\n577\n00:28:50.121 --> 00:28:54.990\n$1000 for some of these devices and\nup so make sure, one of the best things\n\n578\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.820\nthat you can do is give it a good\nprotection, good protective cover.\n\n579\n00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.330\nSome people, they differ a little bit.\n\n580\n00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.830\nMe personally I like\nthings like the Otterbox,\n\n581\n00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:09.540\nwhich is fully encased because I can't put\na protective screen on to save my life.\n\n582\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.090\nI always get dust or bubbles in\nbetween it, and unfortunately, well,\n\n583\n00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.495\nit just causes all kinds of havoc.\n\n584\n00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:20.650\nWaterproofing, keep in mind,\nI don't like the term waterproofing.\n\n585\n00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.390\nWater resistance is a little bit better\nbecause they do have phones like\n\n586\n00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:28.210\nthe Samsung 8, again,\nI really want me a Samsung Galaxy 8,\n\n587\n00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.350\nthat is truly waterproof.\n\n588\n00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:35.220\nHowever, keep in mind that you have to\nbe careful with the terminology here.\n\n589\n00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.400\nCause you could say highly water\nresistant versus waterproof.\n\n590\n00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.800\nWaterproof is the fact that I\ncould throw it in a fish tank, and\n\n591\n00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.920\nI could pull it back out, and it's fine.\n\n592\n00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.540\nVersus, I can get a little bit of\nwater on it, and it survives that.\n\n593\n00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.450\nSo be careful with that.\n\n594\n00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.760\nCredit card readers potentially,\nI've seen these.\n\n595\n00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.220\nIn fact, we've got a little\nlunch truck that comes here.\n\n596\n00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.130\nAnd they give us some mexican food,\nright, and they plug this into\n\n597\n00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:01.300\nthe side of one of those jacks that no\nlonger exist on certain Apple devices.\n\n598\n00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.650\nIt allows you to swipe your credit card,\nright?\n\n599\n00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.470\nJust a little thin device that usually\nplugs into some kind of external\n\n600\n00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.880\nconnection.\n\n601\n00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.410\nAnd potentially for\nthe expansion of your local storage,\n\n602\n00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.510\nyou could have memory cards or,\nif you will, the micro SD cards.\n\n603\n00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.130\nPay attention because I don't have that,\nfor instance, on my cell phone.\n\n604\n00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.480\nThe pixel does not come, doesn't come\nwith an external memory card slot.\n\n605\n00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.659\nI basically back up to the cloud.\n\n606\n00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:27.433\n&gt;&gt; Mine does.\n[LAUGH]\n\n607\n00:30:27.433 --> 00:30:28.165\n&gt;&gt; Yours does,\n\n608\n00:30:28.165 --> 00:30:31.570\nanother reason I'm gonna go to that phone,\nthat's right.\n\n609\n00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.490\nSo, after this episode is done,\nwhich is coming to the end, Dan and\n\n610\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.492\nI are gonna have a UFC fight, right?\n\n611\n00:30:37.492 --> 00:30:41.195\n[LAUGH] We'll end up seeing\nwhose phone is better.\n\n612\n00:30:41.195 --> 00:30:42.230\nHis is gonna win though.\n\n613\n00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.540\nBut Dan I know there's a lot of different\ntopics that we've talked about but\n\n614\n00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.640\nI think we got it all in this episode.\n\n615\n00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Wes, great job giving\nus a great overview of what we can\n\n616\n00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.510\nexpect inside of mobile devices as A+\ntechnicians, things that we might need to\n\n617\n00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.670\nbe able to support and understand about\nthem, and especially when it comes to\n\n618\n00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.900\nthe exam they're gonna ask up maybe a\nquestion or two about said mobile devices.\n\n619\n00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.670\nGiven you a great 30,000 foot view of the\ndifferent types that you might encounter.\n\n620\n00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.980\nThat being said, Wes,\nwe do thank you for joining us.\n\n621\n00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.840\nBut it does look like it is that time for\nus tosign off.\n\n622\n00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.811\nFor itpro.tv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n623\n00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:15.845\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n624\n00:31:15.845 --> 00:31:23.077\n[MUSIC]\n\n625\n00:31:23.077 --> 00:31:25.553\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:08.128\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:11.094\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.514\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:16.036\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.440\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nanother episode of CompTIA A+.\n\n9\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.400\nAnd in this episode, it's all about\ncommon Mobo, RAM, CPU, and power issues.\n\n10\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.600\nAnd once again, our IT expert for\nall of this is Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.750\nHey, Wes, good to see you, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.500\nThat's right and I have props to you, man.\n\n14\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.660\nThey put a doctoral dissertation\nin some of these episode titles.\n\n15\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.872\nYou did a great job, man.\n\n16\n00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:40.376\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:41.260\n&gt;&gt; That's right ,well,\n\n18\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.650\nZach's pretty much told us [LAUGH]\njust about every component that\n\n19\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.430\nwe're really gonna be talking\nabout troubleshooting.\n\n20\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.505\nAnd it's gonna be the major\nsystem components, right,\n\n21\n00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.245\nthat you see inside of the system unit,\nright.\n\n22\n00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:52.334\nWe have our motherboard, right,\n\n23\n00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:56.519\nmotherboard can cause all kinds of\nhavoc [LAUGH] when things go wrong.\n\n24\n00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.366\nWe're gonna talk about our memory, CPU,\nas well as some of the power issues that\n\n25\n00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:05.670\nwe might face when it comes to\ncommon symptoms for the A+ exam.\n\n26\n00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.080\nNow, I would recognize some of\nthe scenarios that we're gonna talk about.\n\n27\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.140\nAnd also do your research because we're\ngonna talk about common symptoms.\n\n28\n00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.340\nBut keep in mind,\nthat when it comes to the computing world,\n\n29\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.040\nyou can find there are many more than just\nsome of the ones that we talk about here.\n\n30\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.212\nSuffice it to say that these will be some\nof the major ones that CompTIA is gonna\n\n31\n00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:25.729\nwant you to know when\nyou sit that 901 exam.\n\n32\n00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.090\nSo let's go ahead and let's talk\nabout just to start our list out.\n\n33\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.108\nAll right, we'll talk some of\nthe common symptoms that they\n\n34\n00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:34.685\ntalk about are things like\nunexpected shutdowns.\n\n35\n00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:39.045\nNow, believe it or not, unexpected\nshutdowns could actually run hand in hand\n\n36\n00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:42.096\nwith some of the other common\nsystems we have, right.\n\n37\n00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:43.585\nUnexpected shutdown, what happens?\n\n38\n00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:45.653\nYou're in the middle of doing something,\n\n39\n00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:49.454\nmaybe watching your favorite YouTube\nvideo, hopefully not at work, right.\n\n40\n00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Not at work.\n\n41\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.567\n&gt;&gt; Right, maybe you're using your\nline of business software, right,\n\n42\n00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:57.705\nyou're doing something and\nall of a sudden your computer shuts down.\n\n43\n00:01:57.705 --> 00:01:59.470\nSo what could the issue be?\n\n44\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.460\nWell, the issue could be quite simply, and\nI've said this before in other episodes,\n\n45\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.150\nit could be the fact that you accidentally\nturned off the power to the power\n\n46\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.670\nstrip, right?\n\n47\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.990\nSimple, fix this first.\n\n48\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.320\nUnexpected shutdown could be the fact that\nthe power cable was just pulled out of\n\n49\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.960\nthe back of the machine or the AC\noutlet or the power strip was shutdown.\n\n50\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.650\nBut the fact that you've\nlost power in the building.\n\n51\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.600\nBut remember, when it comes to your\ntroubleshooting methods, right,\n\n52\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.830\nwe talk about narrowing\ndown the playing field.\n\n53\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.680\nNarrowing down the scope, right?\n\n54\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.090\nIf it happens to be a power\nissue inside of your building,\n\n55\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.140\nchances are you're not the only one\nthat's gonna be affected by it, right?\n\n56\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.880\nSo that one might be\na little bit more obvious.\n\n57\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.538\nHowever, if you can't isolate it down to\nthe fact that it's happening to everybody,\n\n58\n00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:39.360\nand it's just happening to you,\n\n59\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.655\nwhat might some of the issues be when\nit comes to these unexpected shutdowns?\n\n60\n00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:47.195\nRight, well there's another one in our\nlist that actually could be doing this and\n\n61\n00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:48.801\nthat's overheating, right?\n\n62\n00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Unexpected shutdowns can happen when\n\n63\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.030\nyour system heats up so much that things\nlike the thermal temperature sensors that\n\n64\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.890\nare built into, for\ninstance like our CPUs,\n\n65\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.430\nthey try to protect themselves from damage\nand they shut themselves down, right.\n\n66\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.360\nThey do that to make sure that they\ntry to protect themselves from\n\n67\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.270\nthermal damage, right.\n\n68\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.390\nSee, when a CPU gets overheated,\nthermal damage is very,\n\n69\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.230\nvery hard to tell if it's happened\njust by the average person, right.\n\n70\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.895\nI'm sure that if you sent the CPU back\nto the manufacturer if it happened to be\n\n71\n00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:21.333\nunder warranty, trust me, they're gonna be\nable to see that it's overheating, right?\n\n72\n00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.180\nBut one of the telltale scientist\nis an unexpected shutdown, right?\n\n73\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.930\nThis could be due to things like\ninadequate cooling inside of the system,\n\n74\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.980\nmay be you had adequate cooling, right?\n\n75\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.879\nBecause remember, overheating and\nunexpected shutdown it means,\n\n76\n00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.170\neverything was running good,\nand then all of the sudden,\n\n77\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.210\nit steered away from what\nthe normality was, right?\n\n78\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.700\nAnd it just automatically or suddenly\nhappened not automatically, right?\n\n79\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.720\nWell, this could be things like dust and\ndebris, right?\n\n80\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.485\nYes, it could be\ninadequate cooling system.\n\n81\n00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:53.035\nBut if it's happening suddenly, what can\nhappen is if you have an adequate cooling\n\n82\n00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:56.975\nsystem, your system fans, you've got\na heat sink, you've got a system fan.\n\n83\n00:03:56.975 --> 00:04:01.415\nPassive or active cooling on your CPU\nwhere there's a system fan in there.\n\n84\n00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.595\nThe system fan might have failed, right?\n\n85\n00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:06.815\nIf that system fan fails for\nwhatever reason,\n\n86\n00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:12.430\nthen the temperature inside of the system\ncase, the tower is gonna start to heat up.\n\n87\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.520\nThe core temperature of the CPU\nis gonna start to rise, and\n\n88\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.240\nwhat happens is over a period of time,\neverything is running right.\n\n89\n00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.570\nIt hits that whatever that spot is and\n\n90\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.860\nI'm not sure exactly what it might be but\nit hits a certain temperature level,\n\n91\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.120\nand everything shuts down,\nso it could be overheating.\n\n92\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.750\nIt could be debris or\ndust inside of your case as well,\n\n93\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.570\nso be mindful of\nthe location of your tower.\n\n94\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.086\nRight, if your tower happens to be inside\na computing desk slid up against the back\n\n95\n00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:44.508\nof the computing desk or\nthe computer desk,\n\n96\n00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:47.649\nand it's basically blocking\noff the rear exhaust vent,\n\n97\n00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:52.382\nyou're crippling your cooling system,\neven if you have adequate cooling, right.\n\n98\n00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:55.744\nIf you happen to be a tech, and\nyou put things back together, but\n\n99\n00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.340\nmaybe you forgot one of the system fans,\nright.\n\n100\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.410\nThat could cause an over-heating issue,\nand the over-heating issue could lead to\n\n101\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.570\nagain, things like those\nunexpected shutdowns.\n\n102\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.430\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou shouldn't put it near a cat box.\n\n103\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely not, definitely not.\n\n104\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.285\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:11.349\n&gt;&gt; Not with the cat hair, right?\n\n106\n00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.087\nYou'll definitely get dust bunnies,\n\n107\n00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:14.113\nfor sure.\nAll right,\n\n108\n00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:17.535\nthe other things that could happen too,\nthey talk about system lockups.\n\n109\n00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.480\nNow system lockups,\n\n110\n00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.850\nsome of these are intermittent issues.\n\n111\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.130\nAnd some of the intermittent issues\nare very, very hard to tackle, right.\n\n112\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.930\nBecause what happens one day\ndoesn't happen the next day,\n\n113\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.640\nit never has a consistent pattern.\n\n114\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.750\nSystem lockups could be software,\nright, it could be a file corruption,\n\n115\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.420\nit could be a virus,\nwe talked about malware, right.\n\n116\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.659\nCould be failing hard drive,\n\n117\n00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.291\neven though we're not really\ntalking about hard drives here.\n\n118\n00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:44.396\nWe've got an episode where we talk about\ntroubleshooting things like hard drives\n\n119\n00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:45.580\nand radar rays.\n\n120\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.860\nCould be file corruption, right?\n\n121\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.517\nFile corruption can cause things\nlike blue screens, right?\n\n122\n00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:53.870\nThe proprietary crash screens\nlike blue screens of death.\n\n123\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.020\nPinwheel, if you're talking about Macs.\n\n124\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.040\nBut, what ends up happening in a system\nlockup, could be the memory, rIght.\n\n125\n00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.840\nIt could be the fact that\nyour memory is failing.\n\n126\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.850\nAnd if the memory's failing, well that\ncan also cause unexpected shutdowns.\n\n127\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.150\nSee a lot a times [COUGH]\nthe reason unexpected shutdowns and\n\n128\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.210\nthese intermittent problems become\nvery hard to troubleshoot is\n\n129\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.510\nit could be a number of things, right?\n\n130\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.059\nSo definitely keep that in mind,\nall right?\n\n131\n00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:21.390\nOther things that you could see,\nblank screen on boot up, on start up.\n\n132\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.600\nNow if it's a blank screen on start up,\nthat could be again,\n\n133\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.740\nwell, it could be a couple of things.\n\n134\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.162\nCould be the fact that your\nmonitor isn't plugged in.\n\n135\n00:06:28.162 --> 00:06:32.010\n[LAUGH] But\nit could be another memory issue.\n\n136\n00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.651\nBlank screen on start up might be the fact\nthat you can't load the operating system\n\n137\n00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:38.304\nin the memory at the time\nthe operating system bootstraps.\n\n138\n00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:40.740\nAnd again,\nyou don't have an image on the screen.\n\n139\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.220\nRight, could the fact that\nyour video adapter has failed.\n\n140\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.364\nRight, it could be the fact that if you\nhave an integrated video card, right,\n\n141\n00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.093\nintegrated video graphics, if you will.\n\n142\n00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:49.892\nCould be a part of the motherboard, right,\n\n143\n00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:52.170\ncould be part of\nthe chipset that's failing.\n\n144\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.390\nAnd some of these could be very, very hard\nto diagnose what exactly the problem is.\n\n145\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.590\nThat's why you have to go through\nyour troubleshooting procedures and\n\n146\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.250\nyou have to make sure that you\ntry more than one theory, right.\n\n147\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.305\nDon't just stop with one theory\nbecause if it's not the solution,\n\n148\n00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:08.980\nthen you have to go back\nto the drawing board.\n\n149\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.930\nYou have to start\nthe troubleshooting process over.\n\n150\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.379\nSo, get into troubleshooting table\nwith more than one theory, right?\n\n151\n00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Some things though,\n\n152\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.460\nthey give you some kind of indication of\nnot only that something's going wrong,\n\n153\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.590\nthey also give you an indication of\nwhat the problem might be, right.\n\n154\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.080\nOr the component that\nmight be having a problem.\n\n155\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.822\nIn fact, well, let's go ahead and talk\nabout things like POST beep codes, right.\n\n156\n00:07:33.822 --> 00:07:37.025\nPOST beep codes are great because of the\nfact, remember on the power-on self-test,\n\n157\n00:07:37.025 --> 00:07:40.450\nright, part of POST is the fact\nthat we're sending signals.\n\n158\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.180\nWhen the BIOS runs that self-diagnostic\ncalled the power-on self-test,\n\n159\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.290\nit's sending out a little electrical\nsignals to the major components within\n\n160\n00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.680\nthe system unit.\n\n161\n00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.773\nAnd it's expecting to get a response back.\n\n162\n00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:55.520\nWhen it gets a response back, it says,\nokay, I recognize CPU, that you're there,\n\n163\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.410\nmemory, I recognize that you're there.\n\n164\n00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.662\nHard drive, you're there,\nvideo, all of that, RAM.\n\n165\n00:08:01.662 --> 00:08:03.710\nAgain, I recognize these\ncomponents are there.\n\n166\n00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.000\nI probably said a couple of those twice.\n\n167\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.805\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n168\n00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:07.030\n&gt;&gt; I recognize you're there.\n\n169\n00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.990\nWe're ready to go.\n\n170\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.009\nWe can now look for the boot code to\nbootstrap the operating system and\n\n171\n00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:14.026\nget the operating system online.\n\n172\n00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:18.110\nBut if something does go wrong,\nif post runs and there's an issue,\n\n173\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.265\nyou'll get an audible beep.\n\n174\n00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:25.140\nAnd why would you get an audible beep\nrather than some kinda system log?\n\n175\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.910\nYou might get that too in BIOS as well.\n\n176\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.801\nThat's because your video sub\nsystem might not load, and\n\n177\n00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:34.638\nif your video sub system doesn't load,\nthere's no way to see blank screen,\n\n178\n00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:36.661\nbasically blank no image on the screen.\n\n179\n00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:39.802\nIt's a blank screen on start up,\nI've got nothing to see.\n\n180\n00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:43.632\nSo giving me some kind of visual display\nor visual indication isn't gonna help me.\n\n181\n00:08:43.632 --> 00:08:48.520\nAnd that's why all of your motherboards\ntypically had a small built in speaker\n\n182\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.790\nmounted soldered in SMD,\nsurface mounted device.\n\n183\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.321\n&gt;&gt; It can be audible.\n\n184\n00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:55.696\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nsoldered right onto the motherboard so\n\n185\n00:08:55.696 --> 00:08:59.155\nthat in that very first early\nstages of the boot process.\n\n186\n00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:02.340\nIf there's something wrong,\nyou'll be made aware of it.\n\n187\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.470\nNot visually cuz the video subsystem\nmight be causing the problem, right?\n\n188\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But audibly you'll be able to hear it.\n\n189\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.350\nIn fact, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n190\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.030\nWe've got a computer right here.\n\n191\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.660\nAnd what I'll go ahead and\ndo, well, let's go ahead and\n\n192\n00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.090\nsee if there is any problems here.\n\n193\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.970\nI'm gonna reach over here and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and start this computer up and\n\n194\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.280\nlet's see if we have any issues.\n\n195\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.430\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n196\n00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.335\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah.\n\n197\n00:09:23.335 --> 00:09:26.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We got some issues, right?\n\n198\n00:09:26.103 --> 00:09:29.593\nAnd that's a distinct series of beeps,\nalmost like Morse code, right?\n\n199\n00:09:29.593 --> 00:09:31.020\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like Morse code.\n\n200\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.150\n&gt;&gt; You could see that it had a couple\nof beeps, it stopped and in fact,\n\n201\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.280\nwe can do it again.\n\n202\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.600\nLet's do this one more time.\n\n203\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.160\nAll right.\n\n204\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.660\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna turn the computer off and\n\n205\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.710\nyou'll see the lights of power down there,\nright?\n\n206\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.705\nWe'll do this one more time.\n\n207\n00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:48.465\n[SOUND] All right, so\n\n208\n00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:54.444\nI had one beep, I had two beeps.\n\n209\n00:09:54.444 --> 00:09:55.731\nAnd then, what was it, three beeps?\n\n210\n00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:56.685\n&gt;&gt; Three beeps.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n211\n00:09:56.685 --> 00:10:00.193\nit's giving me some indication\nthat there's something wrong.\n\n212\n00:10:00.193 --> 00:10:03.510\nNow, my guess it's probably the memory,\nZach.\n\n213\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.040\nCan you tell me maybe why you\nthink it might be the memory?\n\n214\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not yet,\nthere's another connection going on there.\n\n215\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.060\nWe're not connecting to the RAM.\n\n216\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.780\n&gt;&gt; And\none of the great things about that is,\n\n217\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.900\nI'm not actually sure that\nit's the memory, right?\n\n218\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.880\nBecause the post codes,\nthey're all different.\n\n219\n00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.035\nOne of the reasons I can\ntell you it's the memory,\n\n220\n00:10:24.035 --> 00:10:27.390\nZack, is I actually have the memory\nsitting next to the computer case itself.\n\n221\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well there's that.\n\n222\n00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:30.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that could probably be\n\n223\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.310\nthe reason, right?\n\n224\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.730\nI pulled the memory out, right?\n\n225\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.950\nAnd that means to just kinda give\nyou guys an example, right Zack?\n\n226\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.860\nAs that post is sending those signals,\ntrying to find those components, and\n\n227\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.230\nit isn't finding those components.\n\n228\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.120\nIn this case, one of the major\ncomponents being the memory, right?\n\n229\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.940\nIt's saying hey, I sent out some signals\nthere, and I didn't get a response.\n\n230\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.510\nI got crickets in the background,\nit's snoozing.\n\n231\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.910\nSo what we want to do is,\nand if we look here,\n\n232\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.870\nyou can see that as far as we know,\neverything is fine, right?\n\n233\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.320\nThe computer's turned on, but\nwe wouldn't be aware of the fact that\n\n234\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.540\nthere's a problem if they were trying\nto give us something visually,\n\n235\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.010\nand let's say it happened\nto be the graphics adapter.\n\n236\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.450\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's put the memory back in this machine.\n\n237\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.410\nAnd let's show you what you should here\n\n238\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.960\nwhen the computer goes to\nthe post process appropriately.\n\n239\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n240\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here's my random\naccess module, my RAM module, right?\n\n241\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.042\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna do self cramming.\n\n242\n00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:33.587\nI've touch the inside of the case here,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n243\n00:11:33.587 --> 00:11:35.883\nI'll just reinstall this RAM right here.\n\n244\n00:11:35.883 --> 00:11:41.236\nAnd if it happens to be, and I've seen\nthis too, where you're replacing RAM and\n\n245\n00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:46.690\nyou don't seat it properly, right, and\nwhat happens is the tech gets in a hurry.\n\n246\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.675\nNow, let me see if you\ncan hear these clicks.\n\n247\n00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.592\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You hear those two clicks?\n\n248\n00:11:50.592 --> 00:11:51.217\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I heard.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n249\n00:11:51.217 --> 00:11:54.090\nthose two clicks let me know\nthat it's seated properly.\n\n250\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.251\nI can tell you, though.\n\n251\n00:11:55.251 --> 00:11:58.839\nI've actually seen it where In the past,\nand I hate to say it,\n\n252\n00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:02.496\nI've actually done it once myself,\nwhere you get in a hurry and\n\n253\n00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:07.120\nyou're putting everything back and\nyou want to get that computer back online.\n\n254\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.850\nMaybe you're a help desk position and\nyou want to get it on.\n\n255\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.370\nIt's not so\nmuch that you wanna clear the ticket.\n\n256\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.124\nMaybe you've got somebody that really,\nreally needs the computer.\n\n257\n00:12:15.124 --> 00:12:16.634\nSo you get to moving fast and\n\n258\n00:12:16.634 --> 00:12:19.665\nthen what happens is you\ndon't properly seat the RAM.\n\n259\n00:12:19.665 --> 00:12:25.590\nYou restart the machine, and unfortunately\nyou get these post beep errors, right?\n\n260\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.190\nSo, let me go ahead, there's another one.\n\n261\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard it.\n\n262\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.061\n&gt;&gt; I got that settled.\n\n263\n00:12:29.061 --> 00:12:33.654\nAnd I wanted to let you guys and\ngals out there know, I did disconnect\n\n264\n00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:38.501\nthe power adapter and after the power,\nor PSU, the power supply unit.\n\n265\n00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:43.487\nAnd after that was disconnected, I went\nahead and pushed the main power button on\n\n266\n00:12:43.487 --> 00:12:48.179\nthe front of the computer and held it\nuntil the lights dissipated just to make\n\n267\n00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:50.612\nsure that I had-\n&gt;&gt; No electricity was flowing through it.\n\n268\n00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:52.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you remember.\n\n269\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.740\nThat's right.\n\n270\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:13:00.060\nMaking sure there's no electricity\nin this case left behind.\n\n271\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.260\n&gt;&gt; If it was, it would be shocking.\n\n272\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this would be a shocking episode.\n\n273\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.980\nThat's right, so let's go ahead.\n\n274\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.350\nWe've got the last one here.\n\n275\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.860\nNow, and again,\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna reconnect,\n\n276\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.190\nback here down at the bottom, I'm gonna\nreconnect the main power adapter.\n\n277\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.270\nI keep saying power adapter,\nI don't know why I'm saying that,\n\n278\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.970\npower supply,\nI swear I know what the component is.\n\n279\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthe power supply does have an adapter.\n\n280\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll go ahead and\nwe'll plug this back in.\n\n281\n00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.920\nAnd Phil's optiplex series,\nthey do something kinda interesting.\n\n282\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.160\nThey do this like pre-post right?\n\n283\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.290\nSo, it actually did a little self\ndiagnostic before I even hit the power\n\n284\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.050\non this too.\n\n285\n00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.450\nSo, we'll go ahead and let's reach\nback here and we'll turn this back on.\n\n286\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.793\nAnd we'll see if we still\nhear those post beeps.\n\n287\n00:13:52.463 --> 00:13:53.050\nAll right.\n\n288\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.180\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we hear.\n\n289\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.910\nWhat we end up having now is\nwe've got a happy system.\n\n290\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.100\n&gt;&gt; Purring away.\n\n291\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the system is happy.\n\n292\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:06.640\nWe don't have those post beeps, so\npost, it's successfully post, right.\n\n293\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.800\nI can't say posted.\n\n294\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.930\nIt successfully went through post,\nit completed the post process.\n\n295\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:16.370\nNow, maybe,\nyou don't know what those post-beeps are.\n\n296\n00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.820\nI certainly don't know and Zack,\n\n297\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.980\nthe only reason I said I was\npicking on you there, man.\n\n298\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.550\nThe only reason I said I knew it was\nthe memory was cuz I removed the memory.\n\n299\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.050\nI wouldn't have known what that code was.\n\n300\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.560\nHad we not had that box open, I couldn't\nhave told you what it was, Zack.\n\n301\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.160\nAnd here's what you can do.\n\n302\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.548\nGo to the manufacturers' website\nif you hear a post beep.\n\n303\n00:14:35.548 --> 00:14:39.070\nCould be a tell tale, obviously, it's\na tell tale sign that something is wrong.\n\n304\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.840\nBut, go to the manufactures website,\nlook up what the post code is, right?\n\n305\n00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.700\nThe post codes can differ from\nthings like ibmpc base miles,\n\n306\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.220\nit could differ from computer to computer.\n\n307\n00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.410\nPay attention on what\nthe manufacturer says.\n\n308\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.080\nIf you're not sure,\nthat's an easy ways to find out.\n\n309\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.670\nAll right.\n\n310\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.420\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Now\n\n311\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.940\nother things that might happen, right?\n\n312\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.130\nYou'll notice that's one of the things\nthat they call out is the BIOS time and\n\n313\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.190\nsettings reset.\n\n314\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.420\nWhat is that about?\n\n315\n00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.220\nWhy would the BIOS time and\nsettings reset?\n\n316\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.940\nWell, if we could go back\nto our computer here,\n\n317\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.290\nI can show you one of the major\nreasons that this might happen.\n\n318\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.690\nIf you'll notice,\ndown here at the bottom there is this,\n\n319\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.030\nlet me see if I can get\nit to shine a little bit.\n\n320\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.365\n&gt;&gt; And once again, don't do this\nat home with everything running.\n\n321\n00:15:23.365 --> 00:15:24.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, that's okay.\n\n322\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.865\nI'm not gonna be reaching\ninside of the case here.\n\n323\n00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:29.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice that battery right there, right?\n\n324\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.290\nAnd you kind to see it shine\nas I pick it up, right?\n\n325\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.482\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That is the CMOS battery, right?\n\n326\n00:15:35.482 --> 00:15:39.542\nAnd if that CMOS battery has failed,\nyou'll know it.\n\n327\n00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:43.833\nBecause when you go into the BIOS and\nyou set the system date and time and\n\n328\n00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:48.854\nyou reboot the computer, when you reboot\nthe computer, that system date and time\n\n329\n00:15:48.854 --> 00:15:53.907\nis gonna revert itself back to whenever\nthe manufacturer manufactured the BIOS.\n\n330\n00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:57.356\nThat's a tell-tale sign that all\nthe settings will revert themselves to\n\n331\n00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:58.757\nthe last thing it remembers.\n\n332\n00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:03.210\nAnd since CMOS is Is that low voltage\nvolatile memory source that if it doesn't\n\n333\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.990\nhave that currents.\n\n334\n00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.964\nIt's basically you're gonna look back and\nsay, hey,\n\n335\n00:16:06.964 --> 00:16:08.140\nBIOS what do you have hard coded?\n\n336\n00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.901\nWhat do you have flash into that memory,\nso\n\n337\n00:16:10.901 --> 00:16:14.908\nthat I can set the configurations\naccording to that, right?\n\n338\n00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:19.450\nSo, same all settings, they're kind\nof like, I've heard them called\n\n339\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.500\nan interesting thing and\nI love the way this one person put it.\n\n340\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.050\nThey're emerged configuration.\n\n341\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.177\nYou have configurations and BIOS that\nare hard coded and flashed into that ROM\n\n342\n00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:33.240\nmodule, if you will, that EEPROM chip\nfrom the time that the motherboard or\n\n343\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.059\nthe computer was released into the market,\nright?\n\n344\n00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:36.722\n&gt;&gt; When it was born.\n\n345\n00:16:36.722 --> 00:16:39.709\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, and that's what that\n\n346\n00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:43.550\ndate and time usually is, is when it\ncame off the assembly line, right?\n\n347\n00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n348\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.210\n&gt;&gt; Now when BIOS looks\nat those CMOS settings,\n\n349\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.560\nwhether you have extra\nhard drives turned on,\n\n350\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.190\ndo you have devices that are enabled\nthat were turned off originally.\n\n351\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.910\nIt says, okay, here's the BIOS settings,\nI'll configure those and\n\n352\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.950\nI'll take the CMOS, the user define\nsettings, and I'll merge them together.\n\n353\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.950\nHowever, it don't have any power in\nthat CMOS battery, everything's gone,\n\n354\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.590\nthere's nothing to merge, right,\nso that could happen as well.\n\n355\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.105\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, your recommendation is\nto replace that CMOS battery like\n\n356\n00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:13.998\nevery three years, is that right?\n\n357\n00:17:13.998 --> 00:17:18.921\n&gt;&gt; Every three years, see and the reason\nI say that, replace the CMOS battery,\n\n358\n00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:20.761\non your time, on your dime.\n\n359\n00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:23.088\nAnd what I mean by that is,\ndon't wait for it to fail.\n\n360\n00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I've got a computer,\n\n361\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.577\nI have to be honest,\nI've got an old Compaq, Zach, and\n\n362\n00:17:27.577 --> 00:17:30.900\nit's gosh, I hate to say it,\nI think it's eight years old now.\n\n363\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.290\nI've never replaced the CMOS\nbattery at all, right?\n\n364\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.710\nIn my home environment, it's just fine.\n\n365\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.480\nThe last time I was using it, I was\nusing it for a media server, all right?\n\n366\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.270\nThat's not good in\na production environment.\n\n367\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.960\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; In production environment,\n\n368\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.510\nyou change it every three years\nwhether you need to or not,\n\n369\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.240\nbecause then you know every three\nyears you've got fresh batteries.\n\n370\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.220\nYou might only do it twice,\nright, six years for\n\n371\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.360\na workstation, you're doing pretty good.\n\n372\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.099\nRight, I mean, six years out\nof a workstation, chances are,\n\n373\n00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:03.336\nyou're gonna have to\nupgrade eventually anyway.\n\n374\n00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:08.052\nSo maybe replace it once,\nyou get your return on investment,\n\n375\n00:18:08.052 --> 00:18:12.080\nwhatever the life cycle of\nthe computer is, right.\n\n376\n00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.650\nNow, other things that could happen.\n\n377\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.920\nIf there's no power, well, no power,\nthis is gonna be where you actually have\n\n378\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.613\nto test the power settings\non the machine itself.\n\n379\n00:18:20.613 --> 00:18:23.100\nAnd there's a couple of different\nways that you can do this, right.\n\n380\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.640\nOne of the ways that you can do this is\nyou can actually use one of these that\n\n381\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.680\nI've got sitting right here,\na little multimeter, right.\n\n382\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.250\nNow how you test and what you test\nis really gonna be contingent on\n\n383\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.980\nthe component that you're testing,\nall right.\n\n384\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.113\nAnd what I mean by that is if you happen\nto be testing like the main power\n\n385\n00:18:40.113 --> 00:18:44.702\nconnector, well, you don't really\nwanna be using a multimeter, right?\n\n386\n00:18:44.702 --> 00:18:48.331\nIn fact, what you're gonna use is one\nof these power supply testers, right?\n\n387\n00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:49.252\n&gt;&gt; Those are great.\n\n388\n00:18:49.252 --> 00:18:51.777\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll show you one of these, and\n\n389\n00:18:51.777 --> 00:18:56.245\nhow I would test the 24-pin connector for\nthe motherboard itself.\n\n390\n00:18:56.245 --> 00:18:59.830\nBut if you think maybe that you have\npower issues for other components,\n\n391\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.571\nright, maybe your power supply.\n\n392\n00:19:01.571 --> 00:19:04.637\nYou're wondering if it's giving you\nthe appropriate voltages, let's say for\n\n393\n00:19:04.637 --> 00:19:07.940\nyour hard drive, well that's where this\nlittle guy comes in handy, the multimeter.\n\n394\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.410\nIn fact, if we go back to our computer,\n\n395\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.910\nlet me show you here what I mean,\nall right?\n\n396\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.010\nSo you have to take your multimeter,\nright?\n\n397\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.630\nAnd you're gonna set it on the appropriate\nvoltages, DC in this case,\n\n398\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.470\nto the one that's closest\nto what you're testing.\n\n399\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.378\nAnd if you remember from our power\nepisode, we talked about for\n\n400\n00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:28.038\ninstance the serial ATA power connector,\nthat 15 pin power connector.\n\n401\n00:19:28.038 --> 00:19:30.772\nIf you remember, the orange wire,\nand if you don't, go back and\n\n402\n00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:33.628\ncheck it out and then you hop back\nto the trouble shooting episodes.\n\n403\n00:19:33.628 --> 00:19:36.771\nI know that the orange\nwire is the 3.3 volts,\n\n404\n00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:39.450\nI know that the red wire here is 5 volts.\n\n405\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.706\nAnd in this case,\nthe one that we used in another episode,\n\n406\n00:19:42.706 --> 00:19:44.510\nit was a yellow wire-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n407\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.810\n&gt;&gt; And that was the 12 volt wire.\n\n408\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.040\nIn this power supply, and\n\n409\n00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.890\nthat's why you have to pay attention to\nthe specifications of the power supply\n\n410\n00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:50.860\nitself.\n\n411\n00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.630\nThe yellow wire's actually\nthe 12 volt wire, right?\n\n412\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So what I do is I just\n\n413\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.790\nturn my multimeter on, right, and\nlet's make sure that I can do that.\n\n414\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:04.287\nWe turn it on, right, and then I'm\ngonna find a decent ground here, right.\n\n415\n00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:07.003\nAnd you gotta be careful because\nof the fact that first of all,\n\n416\n00:20:07.003 --> 00:20:08.580\nyou are dealing with electricity.\n\n417\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.974\nSo if you don't feel\ncomfortable doing this,\n\n418\n00:20:11.974 --> 00:20:15.465\nescalate the situation\nto somebody that does.\n\n419\n00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:20.294\nI'll find a ground point here,\nand what I am gonna just do is I\n\n420\n00:20:20.294 --> 00:20:24.747\nam gonna take this,\nI'll take this power supply here or\n\n421\n00:20:24.747 --> 00:20:30.340\nthe power connector of the serial\nATA drive that we have here.\n\n422\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.800\nAnd one of the reasons we went through\nthe pins here in another episode and\n\n423\n00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.970\nshown you what you should expect is so\nthat when you test this,\n\n424\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.140\nyou can find out what\nvoltages should you expect.\n\n425\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.450\nSo I'm gonna test the orange wire.\n\n426\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.920\nAnd what I should see over on my\nmultimeter is somewhere around 3 volts.\n\n427\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.900\nZach, am I getting just around, and\n\n428\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.500\nit's kind of hard especially\nif you had caffeine.\n\n429\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.858\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 3.36.\n&gt;&gt; Am I getting around 3.3 volts, okay.\n\n430\n00:20:55.858 --> 00:20:57.314\n&gt;&gt; 3.36.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm at the 3.3 volts, right?\n\n431\n00:20:57.314 --> 00:20:58.266\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n432\n00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:00.740\n&gt;&gt; And you can see that\nit's within the tolerances.\n\n433\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.650\nSo if I figured that I had\na power supply issue, well,\n\n434\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.530\nI can't tell it from, at least not\nfrom this vantage point, right?\n\n435\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.850\nI can't tell because this is exactly where\nit needs to be, and I'll go ahead and\n\n436\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.390\nI'll plug this back in.\n\n437\n00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.430\nNow, the next test that we're\ngonna do does require you to\n\n438\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.760\ndisconnect the power supply altogether,\nright?\n\n439\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.010\nIf you're gonna test\nthe main power supply,\n\n440\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.810\nthe best way to do it is with one\nof these power supply connectors.\n\n441\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.160\nSo that's gonna be the next\nthing that we're gonna do.\n\n442\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.470\nLet's show you what you should expect\nif you put a power supply, and\n\n443\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:44.360\nmore importantly, the 24 pin connector and\nyou need to test that.\n\n444\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.135\nLet's go ahead and check that out next.\n\n445\n00:21:46.135 --> 00:21:49.030\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, is it if the main power\nconnectors are moved to the motherboard,\n\n446\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.470\nwill the power supply\nautomatically turn on?\n\n447\n00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.850\n&gt;&gt; Interesting question,\nand the answer is no.\n\n448\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.170\nThat's part of the ATX standard,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n449\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:01.090\nAnd one of those pins is actually there\nto let the power supply know whether it's\n\n450\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.320\nplugged into the main power\nconnector on the motherboard.\n\n451\n00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.950\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you with\nthis computer here, you'll see that we\n\n452\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:14.710\nactually have a green power cable in\nhere if you will, conductor if you will.\n\n453\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.670\nWell, that is actually responsible for\nletting you know whether that power\n\n454\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.120\nsupply is connected to the 20 pin\nconnector on the motherboard.\n\n455\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.320\nSo, that's one of the reasons if you're\ntesting the main power connector,\n\n456\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.570\nthere are ways that you can do it with the\nmultimeter but it is a little bit risky.\n\n457\n00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.360\nAnd that's why I say, if you're testing\nthe main power supply connector, the other\n\n458\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.870\nconnectors is fine as long as you leave\nit connected to the 20 pin connector and\n\n459\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:45.110\nstill practice safety,\nyou can test the other connectors.\n\n460\n00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.050\nBut when it comes\nthe the main power connector,\n\n461\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.873\nwhat you're gonna wanna do is use\none of these power supply testers.\n\n462\n00:22:49.873 --> 00:22:50.562\n&gt;&gt; Those are great.\n\n463\n00:22:50.562 --> 00:22:54.519\n&gt;&gt; And what that does is it kind of\nsimulates, it kind of lies to the power\n\n464\n00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:58.548\nsupply because when you connect\nthe main power connector in here, and\n\n465\n00:22:58.548 --> 00:23:00.235\nwe'll go ahead and do this.\n\n466\n00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:05.620\nAnd go ahead and connect the P4\nconnector in there, all right.\n\n467\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.190\nIt's going to let you know,\nagain it's tricking you.\n\n468\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.430\nIt thinks, it's sending that signal.\n\n469\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.202\nIt thinks it's plugged\nin to the motherboard.\n\n470\n00:23:12.202 --> 00:23:16.730\nIt's gonna let you know, hey visually,\nwhether you've got power or not, right?\n\n471\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.320\nSo let's see if we could simulate\nwhat you would see, an error here.\n\n472\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.002\nSo I'll go ahead and\nI'll turn on this power supply.\n\n473\n00:23:23.002 --> 00:23:27.352\nAnd notice how instantly it goes red and\nit turned right off,\n\n474\n00:23:27.352 --> 00:23:29.580\nand now it won't come back on.\n\n475\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.380\nNow I kinda simulated that for\na reason here,\n\n476\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.270\nand I'll do it one more time here,\nand then we'll correct the issue.\n\n477\n00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.485\nNotice how it comes on?\n\n478\n00:23:37.485 --> 00:23:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It knows that it's connected.\n\n479\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.903\nThis know, the device knows that it's\nconnected and I go to turn it on and\n\n480\n00:23:44.903 --> 00:23:46.368\nit won't even turn on.\n\n481\n00:23:46.368 --> 00:23:50.418\nIt gave me the little red light there and\nit said, hey, there's something wrong with\n\n482\n00:23:50.418 --> 00:23:52.853\nthis, and again if I can get\nthe it to turn on there.\n\n483\n00:23:52.853 --> 00:23:54.231\nYeah, see it won't even turn on.\n\n484\n00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:57.676\nIt's letting me know there's\nsomething wrong With the power,\n\n485\n00:23:57.676 --> 00:23:59.412\nthe main power connector here.\n\n486\n00:23:59.412 --> 00:24:03.872\nSo we don't wanna see that, what we wanna\nsee is that when we turn the power,\n\n487\n00:24:03.872 --> 00:24:08.080\nyou know, the power, I say the power but\nthe power supply tester on.\n\n488\n00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.989\nWhat we wanna see is this right here.\n\n489\n00:24:09.989 --> 00:24:13.580\nAnd you can kinda see what it's going\nthrough, the problem's there's a little\n\n490\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.090\nbit of a loose connection right there,\nso let me push that back in there.\n\n491\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.656\nAnd we'll see if we could turn\nthat back on, and there we go.\n\n492\n00:24:19.656 --> 00:24:22.055\nSo we gotta blue,\nin this case we gotta blue light.\n\n493\n00:24:22.055 --> 00:24:23.950\nSo it's letting us know that we are good.\n\n494\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.960\nNow there might be a time where\nmaybe it isn't main power connector,\n\n495\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.930\nmaybe you're connecting\nan external device to a USB port.\n\n496\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.169\nMaybe you wanna test and find out\nthe USB ports have the right voltage.\n\n497\n00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:37.337\nWell you could use your\nmultimeter there as well, or\n\n498\n00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:39.720\nyou could use one of these USB testers.\n\n499\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.110\nSo let's go ahead, and\nthat will be the next thing,\n\n500\n00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.625\nlet's check to see if we are getting the\nappropriate voltages out of the USB port.\n\n501\n00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:47.232\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n502\n00:24:47.232 --> 00:24:51.826\nNow Wes, you mentioned USB, and\nin other episodes we talked about USB and\n\n503\n00:24:51.826 --> 00:24:52.970\npower needed.\n\n504\n00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.000\nWe look at a what like five volts?\n\n505\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.130\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n506\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:56.675\nThat's right.\n\n507\n00:24:56.675 --> 00:24:58.260\nSo he was paying attention, right?\n\n508\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.090\nRemember, USB if we're gonna test\nthe power output of that we're looking for\n\n509\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:03.980\naround five volts.\n\n510\n00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.560\nIf it happens to be a powered fire wire\ncable, that's gonna be 12 volts, right?\n\n511\n00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.170\nSo again,\nmore of those common voltages we see.\n\n512\n00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:14.810\nLet's go ahead and show you, because I've\ngot a USB connector, or a USB voltage,\n\n513\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.685\nif you will,\ndiagnostic little machine here.\n\n514\n00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:20.234\nThese USB testers are really cool.\n\n515\n00:25:20.234 --> 00:25:22.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This one is actually really,\n\n516\n00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.750\nreally cool.\n\n517\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.020\nAnd if I just lift up on that front here,\n\n518\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.760\nyou'll see that we've got\nour 4 USB ports there.\n\n519\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.710\nNow what I am going to do,\nis I'm just going to plug this in, and\n\n520\n00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.880\nwe're going to find out if it's in range.\n\n521\n00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.750\nAnd this one comes on instantly.\n\n522\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:40.630\nAnd if we go ahead and zoom in there just\na little bit, you might see that well,\n\n523\n00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.023\nthe top one is what we're\nlooking at there Zack.\n\n524\n00:25:43.023 --> 00:25:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Does that look\n\n525\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.010\nlike it's actually five volts?\n\n526\n00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.630\n&gt;&gt; It looks like 4.98 not quite 5.\n\n527\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.690\n&gt;&gt; That's right so\nwe're a little under powered here.\n\n528\n00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:56.030\nAnd if I go back to that screen here, if I\ncould remember, go back to that screen I\n\n529\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.810\ncan see that, yeah, it's right at\nfive volts but not quite five volts.\n\n530\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:01.890\n&gt;&gt; Not quite there.\n\n531\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Now, is that gonna cause a problem?\n\n532\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.810\nWell, I'm not sure but we do know that\nwe have some kind of voltage issue and\n\n533\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.140\nthis one is really cool because you can\nactually do a couple of things, right?\n\n534\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.170\nI can slow down the frames per second\non this and I can actually see a graph.\n\n535\n00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.180\nA detailed graph and\nif I slow that down a little bit.\n\n536\n00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.690\nYou'll see there that we've got, it tells\nme what the current voltage is, right?\n\n537\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.610\nSo it just under five volts.\n\n538\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.350\n&gt;&gt; It's under, yep.\n\n539\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:32.010\n&gt;&gt; So again, you can diagnose this\nwith a couple of different tools.\n\n540\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.200\nThat's one of the ones that you can do.\n\n541\n00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.390\nAnd again, that's a US Speed tester.\n\n542\n00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:40.390\nThis one is a little bit more expensive,\nthere's as cheap as 14, 15 bucks.\n\n543\n00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.660\nThis one actually costs a little bit more\nbecause it does a lot of different things\n\n544\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.610\nbut those are some of the things\nif you have power issues\n\n545\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.030\nthat you can use if you will\nto kind of trouble shoot it.\n\n546\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.580\nRemember your multimeter, right?\n\n547\n00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.760\nDon't worry about the USB one.\n\n548\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.330\nWe threw that one in there as an added\nbenefit here inside of this episode, but\n\n549\n00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:00.160\nalso remember your multimeter,\nyour power supply tester.\n\n550\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.180\nIf you think it happens to be a network\nadapter issue, where it may be the network\n\n551\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.270\nadapter's been physically damaged, this\ncan happen in lightning storms, right?\n\n552\n00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.070\nRemember, copper media?\n\n553\n00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.140\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n554\n00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.610\n&gt;&gt; Copper media makes an excellent\nlightning rod, right?\n\n555\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.560\nSo if it comes down, that electrical\ncurrent comes down the cable\n\n556\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.130\ncould make it's way right into\nthe network adapter, could fry it out.\n\n557\n00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.590\nOne of the things you'll do is\nput a hardware loopback plug.\n\n558\n00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.950\nAnd all that does is it basically crosses\nover the transmit and receive pins and\n\n559\n00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.640\nit loops the transmit pins out the adapter\nand back into the receive pins and\n\n560\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.400\nthen if you try to use your pin\nutility like we talked about in\n\n561\n00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.210\nother network communication or\nin some of our other networking episodes,\n\n562\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:43.260\nyou can see whether at a physical level\nif the electrical capabilities of\n\n563\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.220\na network adapter to send and\nreceive communication.\n\n564\n00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.350\nThe other thing you have\nare what are known as postcards.\n\n565\n00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.210\nNow postcards are very,\nvery cool because what they can do is,\n\n566\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.800\nremember we talked about post beep codes?\n\n567\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.490\nWell, what if you want some kind\nof visual diagnostic, right?\n\n568\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.833\nYou want to find out visually if\nyou're having a post issue, right?\n\n569\n00:28:03.833 --> 00:28:08.651\nNow, again, postcards here, don't think\nthat that's what Zach's gonna mail me if\n\n570\n00:28:08.651 --> 00:28:10.971\nhe wins the lottery from Hawaii, right?\n\n571\n00:28:10.971 --> 00:28:11.950\n&gt;&gt; Wish you were here.\n\n572\n00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.040\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\ndifferent kind of postcard there.\n\n573\n00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.520\nBut let's go ahead, and\nlet's take a second here, and\n\n574\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.377\nwe'll show you here on this computer\nwhat the postcard looks like.\n\n575\n00:28:20.377 --> 00:28:23.170\nYes Axel, and you can see it right there.\n\n576\n00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.250\nThere's the postcard.\n\n577\n00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; You can see it there with the little\n\n578\n00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.530\nnumeric readout there,\nthe digital readout there, and the lights.\n\n579\n00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.430\nAnd that's a good way, a visual way right?\n\n580\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.820\nWe've been talking about\nthe post beep codes, right?\n\n581\n00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.260\nThe post beep codes, they give you\nthe ability to hear something audible.\n\n582\n00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.290\nWell, some people like the visualization.\n\n583\n00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.750\nThey like to actually see what's going on.\n\n584\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.810\nAnd a lot of your new motherboards\nactually have those little readouts\n\n585\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.270\nbuilt right into the motherboard.\n\n586\n00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.240\nSo you don't even need the cards anymore.\n\n587\n00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.030\nThat one just fits at a PCI slot.\n\n588\n00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.800\nSo pay attention to your bus architecture\ntoo cuz you don't wanna get one per PCI\n\n589\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.470\nslot and you don't have any\nPCI slots on the motherboard.\n\n590\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.810\nSo pay attention to your bus architecture.\n\n591\n00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.314\nCouple of the other things\nthat we didn't mention here,\n\n592\n00:29:02.314 --> 00:29:05.681\nthey talk about attempts to\nboot to incorrect device.\n\n593\n00:29:05.681 --> 00:29:09.612\nThis can happen when you've left\na non-boot disc let's say maybe in\n\n594\n00:29:09.612 --> 00:29:14.450\nthe optical tray and it's trying to find a\nboot record there and it doesn't find it.\n\n595\n00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.700\nA lot of times your\nBIOS can get over that.\n\n596\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.730\nIt can say I looked there and\nI I didn't find it.\n\n597\n00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.660\nLet me move on to the next device.\n\n598\n00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.650\nHowever, I have found where\nlike we were talking about\n\n599\n00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.990\nthe CMOS battery there in one\nof my machines that I have.\n\n600\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:32.820\nWhere if you put a USB device in\na USB port in the boot sequence in\n\n601\n00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.980\nthe BIOS was set to look at USB,\nit would find the USB device and if\n\n602\n00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.770\nit wasn't meant to be a bootable device,\neven if it wasn't a bootable device,\n\n603\n00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.080\nit would hang right there and it wouldn't\nbe able to find the operating system.\n\n604\n00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.540\nAnd you'd literally have to remove the USB\ndevice, cold boot the machine, and\n\n605\n00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.150\nrestart it.\n\n606\n00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:57.705\nSo check your boot order and also\ncheck for non-bootable devices, right?\n\n607\n00:29:57.705 --> 00:29:58.905\nBeing plugged into the machine.\n\n608\n00:29:58.905 --> 00:30:00.625\nUSB is one of the big ones there too.\n\n609\n00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:05.245\nSome of the other things that they talk\nabout too, intermittent device failure.\n\n610\n00:30:05.245 --> 00:30:07.335\nIf this happens it could be a shorting.\n\n611\n00:30:07.335 --> 00:30:09.702\nSomething's grounding out\npay attention to your case.\n\n612\n00:30:09.702 --> 00:30:12.822\nPay attention to wires,\nloose wires that are inside of the cable.\n\n613\n00:30:12.822 --> 00:30:14.942\nThat could be a problem too.\n\n614\n00:30:14.942 --> 00:30:16.842\nAgain, no power to other devices.\n\n615\n00:30:16.842 --> 00:30:18.712\nWe kinda talked about\nthe power in general.\n\n616\n00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:23.432\nIf there's no power to other devices,\nit could be the power supply has failed.\n\n617\n00:30:23.432 --> 00:30:27.222\nIt could be the fact that you just didn't\nseek the power connections correctly.\n\n618\n00:30:27.222 --> 00:30:28.422\nThat can happen too.\n\n619\n00:30:28.422 --> 00:30:33.620\nI've seen that where and\nlike on a serial ATA power connector.\n\n620\n00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.370\nEven though it is difficult\nto reverse them right?\n\n621\n00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.510\nBecause it's got an L pattern on it, you\nmight see that they don't fully sit and\n\n622\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.568\nthat might be one of the reasons that you\ndon't have power to those devices too.\n\n623\n00:30:46.568 --> 00:30:49.130\nIf the fan spin and\n\n624\n00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.050\nnothing else is happening,\npay attention to your post codes, right?\n\n625\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.040\nYour post codes could be an indicator.\n\n626\n00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.186\nLike for instance, when we had the post\naudible beeps with the memory being out,\n\n627\n00:30:58.186 --> 00:30:59.900\nthe fans were spinning just fine.\n\n628\n00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.580\nNothing else was happening, right?\n\n629\n00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.640\nSo pay attention to that, too.\n\n630\n00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.620\nLet's see, a couple of other things,\nindicator lights.\n\n631\n00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.570\nYou could have proprietary\nindicator lights.\n\n632\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.400\nYou have the front panel.\n\n633\n00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.320\nIndicator lights that tell\nyou have drive activity,\n\n634\n00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.290\npay attention if there's a drive\nproblem it could show you that.\n\n635\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:21.780\nThe power light itself could be an\nindicator light that it's supposed to go\n\n636\n00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.040\nmaybe green or blue and it goes to\nan amber color and it stays that way.\n\n637\n00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.220\nThat could be a sign indicating that\nthere's a problem with the machine, you\n\n638\n00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.840\nmight have a numerical readout actually\non the front built into the machine too.\n\n639\n00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.844\nPay attention to your vendors, right?\n\n640\n00:31:35.844 --> 00:31:39.037\nGo to your vendor's website,\nthe manufacturer's website, and\n\n641\n00:31:39.037 --> 00:31:42.400\npay attention to what some of\nthe indicator lights are cuz they're not\n\n642\n00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.470\nconsistent across all manufacturers.\n\n643\n00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:49.040\nI've even seen them with in a family\nof products that are made by the same\n\n644\n00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.620\nmanufacturer where they're just slightly\ndifferent between the different models.\n\n645\n00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.950\nSo do pay attention to that.\n\n646\n00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.850\nCouple of the big ones here guys and\ngals out there to worry about smoke and\n\n647\n00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.920\na burning smell, all right.\n\n648\n00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.030\nIf we talk about smoke,\n\n649\n00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.730\nthat's an indication that something\nis burning obviously, right?\n\n650\n00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.000\nIt is not good.\n\n651\n00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.160\nMake sure that you disconnect the power\nfrom the system even if you have to shut\n\n652\n00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.280\noff the power strip or\n\n653\n00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.290\nunplug from the AC outlet if you\nhappen to have a power strip.\n\n654\n00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.390\nBe safe, fire safety on that one,\n\n655\n00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.370\nbecause again it could actually be\na fire that's inside of the machine.\n\n656\n00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.370\nIf you're smelling something burnt,\n\n657\n00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.410\nyou've already got burnt\nmetal in the device itself,\n\n658\n00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.920\nit's gonna be a process of elimination\nof which device might have failed.\n\n659\n00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.700\nIf it happens to be a motherboard,\nunfortunately,\n\n660\n00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.500\nyou're gonna to replace\nthe whole entire motherboard.\n\n661\n00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.020\nIf it happens to be an adapter card,\n\n662\n00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.090\nyou might have the ability to\npull the adapter card out, right?\n\n663\n00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.740\nIf it happens to be the CPU,\nmaybe you can replace the CPU, but\n\n664\n00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.670\nyou gotta to be careful because\nif the CPU does overheat.\n\n665\n00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.580\nBecause of the fact that there is\nplastics around that CPU where it\n\n666\n00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.890\nsits in the socket in the motherboard,\n\n667\n00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.970\nyou might have melted a portion\nof the motherboard too.\n\n668\n00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.570\nSo you do have to keep in mind that\nusually when you smell smoke or see smoke,\n\n669\n00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.330\ndefinitely you have to worry about that.\n\n670\n00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.960\nBut if you smell a burning smell,\n\n671\n00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.660\na lot of times it means the components\nare just going to have to be replaced.\n\n672\n00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.680\nBut, more than anything,\nkeep yourselves safe out there.\n\n673\n00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Remember electrical safety,\n\n674\n00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.440\nremember your troubleshooting theory, and\n\n675\n00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.240\nif you don't feel you have\nadequate training for\n\n676\n00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.440\nwhatever's being presented to you,\nthen escalate it to somebody who does.\n\n677\n00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.550\nThere's no, you know,\ndon't let egos get involved.\n\n678\n00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:26.630\nRemember there's no problem saying I\ndon't know and I need help with that.\n\n679\n00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.880\nMemorize some of these scenarios, and\nbe familiar with some of the scenarios and\n\n680\n00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.070\nsymptoms that we've talked about in this\nepisode, and you should be doing well for\n\n681\n00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.230\nyour A plus exam.\n\n682\n00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.582\n&gt;&gt; Awesome as usual, Wes.\n\n683\n00:33:35.582 --> 00:33:39.450\nCommon Mobo, RAM, CPU, and\npower issues, wonderful episode.\n\n684\n00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.330\nRewatching a few times,\nit will be good for you.\n\n685\n00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.000\nAnd also, why don't you do this?\n\n686\n00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.600\nSee every episode of the CompTIA plus\nseries and visit our course library.\n\n687\n00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.200\nThere's hundreds of videos right\nthere to help you go further and\n\n688\n00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.349\ndon't forget to tell a friend or\nfriends

00:00:08.165\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:10.720\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.662\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:19.590\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.510\nwe are continuing in A+ series and\nwe're glad your joining us again today.\n\n9\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.790\nAnd joining us as well again today\nis our good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.710\nWes, glad to have you again,\nhow's it going today, man?\n\n11\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.740\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.332\nLooking through a plethora of different\nthings we have to worry about.\n\n13\n00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.270\n&gt;&gt; A plethora.\n\n14\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's a nice word.\n\n15\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.130\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n16\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.491\n&gt;&gt; That calendar's really working out for\nyou.\n\n17\n00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:38.474\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man, I have no clue what it means, but\n\n18\n00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:39.522\nwhen you get one word a day.\n\n19\n00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:40.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:42.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, so we have to,\n\n21\n00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:43.640\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n22\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.970\nWe're continuing on when it comes to\ntroubleshooting motherboards, RAM,\n\n23\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.000\nCPU, and power issues.\n\n24\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.180\nAnd we talked in the first part,\n\n25\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.970\nwe talked about some of the different\nthings that you could see.\n\n26\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.366\nUnexpected shut down, system locks, and\nwe'll talked a little bit more about\n\n27\n00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.660\nthings like for\ninstance your post-error codes, right.\n\n28\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.325\nSo we talk about post-code beeps.\n\n29\n00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:09.502\nRemember ladies and gentlemen, there\nare so many different types out there\n\n30\n00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:13.938\nthat you really just, I think for the A+\nexam what you have to know is that, hey,\n\n31\n00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:18.575\nif I hear an audible beep, it's gonna\nbe some kind of post beep that happens.\n\n32\n00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:22.425\nIt's gonna be the power on self test run,\ndiscovered a problem with some of\n\n33\n00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:27.395\nthe hardware, so BIOS couldn't initialize\nit, and we get some kind of stop.\n\n34\n00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:32.318\nSometimes you'll get for instance, the\nwhole entire computer will just stop and\n\n35\n00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:36.455\nyou'll have a low resolution,\nvery pixelated test on the screen and\n\n36\n00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:38.117\nsome kind of information.\n\n37\n00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:41.230\nHowever, it could be\njust the audible beeps.\n\n38\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.890\nAnd the reason I say that, one of the\nthings I didn't mention in the last part\n\n39\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.930\nis, well, you have to understand that\nwhen post runs your video subsystem\n\n40\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.315\nhasn't even initialized yet, so\nthat's why we have the audible beeps.\n\n41\n00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.790\nRight,it's not even part of your\nsound card, believe it or not.\n\n42\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.770\nIt's actually an external speaker that\ntakes very little to bring online,\n\n43\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.970\nif you will, and that's just in\nthe firmware of your BIOS ROM chip.\n\n44\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.230\nSo those are some of the things we\ntalked about in the first part.\n\n45\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.635\nIf, that isn't making sense to you,\nyou're like, hm, I don't remember that.\n\n46\n00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:15.086\nMake sure you go back and watch that part,\nand then come back here and\n\n47\n00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:15.826\njoin us in part two.\n\n48\n00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.485\nNow, speaking of part two,\nwhat are we going into now?\n\n49\n00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:21.055\nWell, we're gonna continue on in\nthe list here of our objectives.\n\n50\n00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:25.241\nGiven a scenario troubleshoot common\nproblems related to motherboards, RAM,\n\n51\n00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.543\nCPU, and power issues.\n\n52\n00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:30.080\nAnd then troubleshooting those\nwith the appropriate tools.\n\n53\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.410\nAll right so,\nmoving on down the list here, we talk,\n\n54\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.970\nthey mentioned blank screen at boot up.\n\n55\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.170\nAll right, blank screen at boot up,\nwell this could be a memory issue and\n\n56\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.050\nsometimes it is.\n\n57\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810\nRemember, it might be video but\nhowever, I have to keep in mind that,\n\n58\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.030\nyou remember the video subsystem\nis gonna be checked during post.\n\n59\n00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.620\nSo, this could be some kind\nof error within the memory,\n\n60\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.340\nthe memory module is failing.\n\n61\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.600\nKeep in mind that you also\nhave sub-BIOS routines.\n\n62\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.011\nAnd we really haven't talked\nabout those too much.\n\n63\n00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:01.300\nI don't think it's something\nthat's gonna come up on the exam.\n\n64\n00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.060\nBut you also have sub-BIOS routines,\nlike for instance,\n\n65\n00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.380\nwhen your graphics card comes online.\n\n66\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.760\nIt has all the hardware and\n\n67\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.500\nfirmware built in the graphics card\nthat it runs its own diagnostic check.\n\n68\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.840\nAnd what it does is, the main bios says,\nokay, I see you there video card,\n\n69\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.990\nyou have your own BIOS, you can run\nyour own little post diagnostic,\n\n70\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.190\nI'll just hold back and you can just\nreport back to me that everything is okay.\n\n71\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.629\nNow, if there is an integrated video,\nthen that's gonna be\n\n72\n00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.777\ndiagnosed during post and it should\ncome back with some kind of error.\n\n73\n00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:38.403\nSo, don't necessarily think that\nthe screen is blank on boot up,\n\n74\n00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:42.936\ncould be your video card, could be memory\nissues, but here's the other thing that\n\n75\n00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:47.320\nyou got to always remember too, and I want\nyou to remember this for the A+ exam.\n\n76\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.507\nWe have stressed over and over through\nthe 901, that simple fix is first.\n\n77\n00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:53.965\nRight, when we talked about networking,\nwe went into our networking episodes,\n\n78\n00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:56.419\nwe talked about, well,\nif I don't have a link light, and\n\n79\n00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.950\nI don't have a network connection, what\nis the first thing I should test, right?\n\n80\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.960\nI should check my cables.\n\n81\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.836\nRight, I should make sure that the cable\nis plugged in, I should make sure that\n\n82\n00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:08.870\nthe router is turned on, right, so\nagain, very simple fixes, right?\n\n83\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.080\nMake sure that you have drivers\npresent in your network adapter.\n\n84\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.510\nWell, if there isn't any screen, if you\ndon't have anything on the screen, and\n\n85\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.100\nit's blank during boot up, you might wanna\nfind out if the monitor's even plugged in.\n\n86\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.300\nAnd as simple as that sounds in me, you\nmight say, hey, well that's so trivial,\n\n87\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.290\nhow could that be on the exam?\n\n88\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.730\nIt very well could be on the exam.\n\n89\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.150\nNow I can't tell you what\nquestions are on the exam.\n\n90\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.570\nWell, that first of all, would be\ncheating, but the questions that you get\n\n91\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.760\nmight not necessarily be\nthe questions somebody else gets.\n\n92\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.100\nSo if anybody tells you, well,\nI didn't get that question on my exam,\n\n93\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.390\nwell it's probably right.\n\n94\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.010\nRemember they do change it up a lot.\n\n95\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.810\nSo check your monitor connections, right?\n\n96\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.510\nCheck connections to\nthe video card itself.\n\n97\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.660\nThe other thing that you might keep\nin mind too is in your BIOS settings.\n\n98\n00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.620\nThat if you do have an integrated video\nadapter, and you have installed a graphics\n\n99\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.700\ncard, make sure that the configurations\nand the BIOS are correct as well.\n\n100\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.721\nSo just a couple of side things\nthat you might need to consider and\n\n101\n00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:06.328\nwhen it comes to the BIOS configuration,\n\n102\n00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:10.440\nthat's more related to your\nmotherboard versus a memory issue.\n\n103\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.777\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat they always also mention here.\n\n104\n00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:17.820\nThey talk about BIOS and setting resets.\n\n105\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.650\nBIOS time and setting resets.\n\n106\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.180\nNow this can happen for,\nwell, a couple of reasons.\n\n107\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.280\nOne of the most common reasons,\nwhich is really what we're looking for\n\n108\n00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.780\nis the commonality here.\n\n109\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.661\nOne of the most common reasons that this\ncan happen is because, well, your little,\n\n110\n00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:37.923\nI think it's a 2332, I don't know\nexactly what the BiOS battery is,\n\n111\n00:05:37.923 --> 00:05:39.398\nlet me check it out here.\n\n112\n00:05:39.398 --> 00:05:43.580\nBut that little BiOS battery,\nor CMOS battery, excuse me,\n\n113\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.526\nthe complementary metal\noxide semiconductor battery.\n\n114\n00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:52.299\nIt's a little CR2032 battery,\nand it's responsible for\n\n115\n00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:56.360\nholding the real-time clock\ninside of your system.\n\n116\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.190\nKeep in mind that we have\nacross the motherboard,\n\n117\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.840\nwe talk about bus speeds,\nwe talk about timing.\n\n118\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.200\nRight, asynchronous and\nsynchronous communications and\n\n119\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.840\nwhen we talk about synchronizing\ncommunications across the motherboard,\n\n120\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.830\nyou need some kinda heartbeat, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.950\nAnd again, kinda like, and Dan,\nI know you're into music heavily, right?\n\n122\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.630\nMetronome, right?\n\n123\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.280\nWhat does a metronome do for\nyou as a guitarist?\n\n124\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just keeps your time, right?\n\n125\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.504\nYou set it to a certain beats per minute,\nand\n\n126\n00:06:21.504 --> 00:06:23.747\nthat way you know you're\non the beat every time.\n\n127\n00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:27.820\nIt's a way for your gauge whether\nyour timing is the right timing.\n\n128\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.850\n&gt;&gt; And most definitely, and that's\nwhat a real time clock essentially is.\n\n129\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.980\nIf you want an analogy,\n\n130\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.770\nthat's analogous to what our real\ntime clock is inside of our machine.\n\n131\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.310\nNow that real time clock, once it's set,\n\n132\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.364\nthose settings are retained in the\nComplementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor\n\n133\n00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:47.810\nsettings, the CMoss settings.\n\n134\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.110\nRemember, the BIOS itself\nhas a hard coded time.\n\n135\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.510\nRight, and the hard coded time,\nit could be set a couple different ways.\n\n136\n00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.819\nIt could be when the computer is actually\nreleased from the manufacture, or\n\n137\n00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:01.360\nmore specifically, the motherboard\nthat's within the computer.\n\n138\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.010\nWhen that motherboard is released,\nit has an initial set of firmware in it.\n\n139\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.470\nIn that firmware, when it was released\nthey had a hard coded time, all right?\n\n140\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.940\nIt is one that will always be there.\n\n141\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.420\nWith one exception,\nif you flash the firmware,\n\n142\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.962\nif you update firmware, every time you\nupdate the firmware, that little hard\n\n143\n00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:24.550\ncoded time is going to be basically, reset\nto the moment that you flash the firmware.\n\n144\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.920\nHowever, that doesn't set the real\ntime clock that has to stay up\n\n145\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.460\nto date in the computer.\n\n146\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.190\nThat is a user defined setting\nthat is retained through the 2032,\n\n147\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.210\nCR2032 CMOS,\na little three hole watch battery.\n\n148\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.600\nWhen that battery fails, all right,\nyour computer fails to keep its time.\n\n149\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.237\nNow I know they call it BIOS time, I'm not\ntrying to confuse you guys here, gals,\n\n150\n00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:48.890\nby any means.\n\n151\n00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.566\nJust keep in mind that,\nthat setting can change.\n\n152\n00:07:50.566 --> 00:07:55.398\nAnd if that time changes,\nwhat happens is Remember that the settings\n\n153\n00:07:55.398 --> 00:08:00.395\nthat are stored in CMOS are volatile\nwhich means if I lose power to them,\n\n154\n00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:04.003\nI no longer have those settings retained,\nright.\n\n155\n00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:07.730\nIt just basically dissipates away and\nwe lose it.\n\n156\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.550\nThe other thing, too, is when you\nhave manufacturer defined settings,\n\n157\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.750\nthose are retained in the EEPROM chip.\n\n158\n00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.730\nAll right so for instance when I first got\nthe computer, it only had a single hard\n\n159\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.080\ndrive in it but the motherboard\nsupports eight hookups, right?\n\n160\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.720\nSo I populated every one of those drives,\ngot a massive fiber ray in there, right?\n\n161\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.511\nWell I had to configure those and\nI had to turn those interfaces on, right.\n\n162\n00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:30.298\nYou've seen in our BIOS setting\nwhere we've gone into the BIOS and\n\n163\n00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:33.300\nwe turned on and\nenabled a hard drive interface, right?\n\n164\n00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.471\nWell, the fact that that is enabled is\nretained in user defined settings that is\n\n165\n00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:39.229\nstored in CMOS battery.\n\n166\n00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:43.811\nAll right when that battery is lost,\nor the voltage if you will, changes or\n\n167\n00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:48.000\nis reduced,\nthose settings are completely discarded.\n\n168\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.137\nSo, one of the telltale signs you can\nsee that your CMOS battery needs to be\n\n169\n00:08:52.137 --> 00:08:56.573\nreplaced It's when you reboot the computer\nand the time is it isn't the same.\n\n170\n00:08:56.573 --> 00:09:00.086\nIt's usually several years earlier\ndepending on how long you've had\n\n171\n00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:02.800\nthe computer, several months earlier.\n\n172\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.060\nSo you go in there and you set the time\nright, and while the computer's on, guess\n\n173\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.960\nwhat, you have power you have voltage\ngoing into it that time stays the same.\n\n174\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.240\nThe moment you reboot the computer,\nremember volatile memory?\n\n175\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.950\nBreak the current,\nsettings are essentially lost.\n\n176\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.300\nNow, there is a piece of advice\nthat I would give you on this, and\n\n177\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.990\nthat is never wait for a CMOS battery\nto fail, before replacing it.\n\n178\n00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.760\nIf you're in a home environment,\nsometimes you never replace the bios or\n\n179\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.040\nthe cmos battery.\n\n180\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.560\nI know I've got a machine, in fact,\na couple machines that I've never replaced\n\n181\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.278\nthe cmos battery, and guess what,\nI've had them for eight, nine, ten years.\n\n182\n00:09:42.278 --> 00:09:44.660\nAll right, In a production machine,\n\n183\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.030\nthat's not something that you want to do,\nall right.\n\n184\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.220\nIn a production machine,\nI've seen other people in the know\n\n185\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.040\nthat will automatically as part of normal\nmaintenance replace these batteries every\n\n186\n00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.390\nthree years regardless whether\nthey need to be replaced or not.\n\n187\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:03.032\nI've actually done this as part of system\nmaintenance in a company that I used to\n\n188\n00:10:03.032 --> 00:10:03.667\nwork for.\n\n189\n00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:08.060\nWe had 150 computers and what I did is I\nwent from room to room to room replacing\n\n190\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.143\nevery single battery, and\nquiet literally I had a bag of\n\n191\n00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:15.490\nbatteries that probably would have\nlasted quiet a good long while.\n\n192\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.050\nBut again when it's your\nmoney that's behind it\n\n193\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.610\nit's not something you\nwanna take a chance in.\n\n194\n00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.030\nEspecially, and it goes without saying,\n\n195\n00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.980\nwhen you talk about for\ninstance, servers, and stuff.\n\n196\n00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo keep that in mind,\nif these BIOS setting time or\n\n197\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:34.184\nthe settings reset,\ngood possibility CMOS battery is failing.\n\n198\n00:10:34.184 --> 00:10:39.042\nNow, it could be and I'm not gonna say\nhighly unlikely it's not as common but\n\n199\n00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:43.622\nit really, It could be the fact that\nthe motherboard itself is failing.\n\n200\n00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:45.660\nWhat happens if you do\nreplace the battery?\n\n201\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.097\nYou replace the battery and guess what,\nyou reboot the computer and\n\n202\n00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:50.189\nthe time is changed.\n\n203\n00:10:50.189 --> 00:10:55.359\nWell unfortunately if that happens then\nchances are you have a failing CMOS and\n\n204\n00:10:55.359 --> 00:10:58.190\nit's just not gonna retain the settings.\n\n205\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.206\nIt isn't gonna retain, we'll try a little\nbetter English, it isn't gonna retain\n\n206\n00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:04.065\nthe settings regardless of what battery\nthat you have put in there, all right.\n\n207\n00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:06.380\nSo that's another thing that\nyou have to keep in mind.\n\n208\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.760\nNow we kind of talked\nabout continuous reboots,\n\n209\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.240\nall right, we already talked about that.\n\n210\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.090\nWell we talked about unexpected shutdowns.\n\n211\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.090\nContinuous reboots, this can happen for\na couple of different ways.\n\n212\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.545\nOne of the ways I've seen is over heating.\n\n213\n00:11:21.545 --> 00:11:24.010\nIf your computer reboots.\n\n214\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.941\nWe've talked about unexpected shutdowns\nand that's complete thermal shutdown.\n\n215\n00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:29.870\nThe computer just doesn't come back on.\n\n216\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.780\nBut it can also be reboots in the computer\nin the fact that it's over heating.\n\n217\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.180\nAnd when the computer comes on,\nit boots up, there's no problem.\n\n218\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.426\nIt stays on for awhile and guess what?\n\n219\n00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:44.907\nIt reboots, that could be a tell-tale\nsign that what you have is you have\n\n220\n00:11:44.907 --> 00:11:48.588\na cooling system within your\nsystem unit that's failing.\n\n221\n00:11:48.588 --> 00:11:51.830\nNow what might need to be replaced, right?\n\n222\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.720\nWell one of the things that might need to\nbe replaced is one of the system fans.\n\n223\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.650\nThe biggest system, and it's not really\na system fan, it's called CPU fan.\n\n224\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.910\nSo let me be very clear on this one\nbecause sometimes we genericize when\n\n225\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.640\nwe get so used to a term.\n\n226\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.065\nThe CPU fan, if it fails, again,\nCPU comes on, it's cool, right?\n\n227\n00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:11.883\nBut as you start to use the machine,\nit starts to ramp up the voltage,\n\n228\n00:12:11.883 --> 00:12:13.592\nneeding more processing power, right.\n\n229\n00:12:13.592 --> 00:12:16.736\nWe have stepping technologies that step\nup the voltage when you need it and\n\n230\n00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.145\nthey reduce the voltage\nwhen you don't need it.\n\n231\n00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:22.845\nBut as that voltage steps up, remember\nthe more electrical current that is passed\n\n232\n00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:25.325\nacross the motherboard,\nthe hotter it's gonna get.\n\n233\n00:12:25.325 --> 00:12:29.866\nAnd that at a certain point, the thermal\ntemperature sensor in that triggers and\n\n234\n00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:32.100\nreboots the machine.\n\n235\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.651\nNow, once the cpu is heated up enough\nit will continuously reboot the machine\n\n236\n00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:38.971\nbecause when it shuts down it boots up.\n\n237\n00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:42.877\nAnd then the thermal temperature center\nsays, I'm still hot, shuts down and\n\n238\n00:12:42.877 --> 00:12:45.120\nyou go through this horrible process.\n\n239\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.789\nNow the other place that\nI've seen this too is when\n\n240\n00:12:46.789 --> 00:12:47.951\nthe hard drives failing, right?\n\n241\n00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:52.910\nThe hard drive is failing, it goes,\nthere's some kind of driver issue.\n\n242\n00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.540\nWe'll talk more about software\nbased issues when get into the 902,\n\n243\n00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.790\nwe'll talk about operating systems.\n\n244\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.830\nSo I don't want to harp on that one too\nmuch, but it could be a driver issue.\n\n245\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.370\nAnd the reason I mention it here in\nhardware is because like we said\n\n246\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:03.880\nin the past,\n\n247\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.940\nremember hardware the only way we work\nwith it is when we have the drivers.\n\n248\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.180\nThe operating systems they have no\nclue about a piece of hardware.\n\n249\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.370\nThat's the beauty of a driver.\n\n250\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.120\nThe driver can be made by the manufacture.\n\n251\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.034\nThe manufacture obviously\nknows the hardware, and\n\n252\n00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:18.393\nour programmers can worry about\ntheir code and their software.\n\n253\n00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:21.170\nAnd they kinda meet in the middle.\n\n254\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.830\nIf the driver isn't present or\nthe driver is corrupted.\n\n255\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.371\nThis can cause reboots, very popular\nin Windows, Linux not so much.\n\n256\n00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:31.860\nLinux is a very stable system, even Mac.\n\n257\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.280\nYour Unix based systems, I don't know\nwhat it is but especially with Linux,\n\n258\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.533\nthey're relatively stable systems.\n\n259\n00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:44.389\nWindows, this does happens and Windows\nhas wide variety of device support.\n\n260\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.720\nWhich also comes with a wide\nvariety of device issues.\n\n261\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.086\nSo, do check out things\nlike device manager again.\n\n262\n00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:54.935\nWe will talk more about 902, and\nyou might be watching this where,\n\n263\n00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:57.625\nwe've already recorded some 902 episodes.\n\n264\n00:13:57.625 --> 00:14:01.115\nAnd we'll talk about\ndiagnostics in there as well.\n\n265\n00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:06.705\nAll right, so, continuous reboots is\nsomething that you have to worry about.\n\n266\n00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:08.315\nNow, the other thing I\nwant you to also know is,\n\n267\n00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:11.877\nthey talk about attempting to\nboot to an inorrect device.\n\n268\n00:14:11.877 --> 00:14:15.157\nNow a couple of things that\ncan cause this, all right.\n\n269\n00:14:15.157 --> 00:14:19.977\nOne of the biggest things that causes this\nis misconfiguration of the BIOS settings.\n\n270\n00:14:19.977 --> 00:14:22.637\nRemember in the BIOS settings you\nhave what's known as a boot sequence\n\n271\n00:14:22.637 --> 00:14:23.803\nor boot order.\n\n272\n00:14:23.803 --> 00:14:25.424\nSynonymous terms,\ndon't let that confuse you.\n\n273\n00:14:25.424 --> 00:14:28.897\nWhen we talk about boot order or\nboot sequence, we talk about where\n\n274\n00:14:28.897 --> 00:14:32.495\ndoes the bios, look for the MBR,\nthe master boot record or where does\n\n275\n00:14:32.495 --> 00:14:36.806\nthe unified extensible firmware UIFI look\nfor the GUI partition table, the GPT.\n\n276\n00:14:36.806 --> 00:14:41.486\nAll right, same thing, it's how we\nboot the UIFI systems, all right well,\n\n277\n00:14:41.486 --> 00:14:43.140\nguess what.\n\n278\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.363\nIf you have configured it to boot to the\noptical drive, which is a commonality and\n\n279\n00:14:47.363 --> 00:14:51.091\nI would say maybe becoming less common\nas optical drives become I don't\n\n280\n00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.657\nwanna say a thing of the past.\n\n281\n00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:53.247\nBut less and\n\n282\n00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:57.650\nless prevalent over things like flash\nmedia that we have like USB thumb drives.\n\n283\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.250\nWell, guess what?\n\n284\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.422\nIf you have an optical disk that is in the\noptical drive and in your boot sequence,\n\n285\n00:15:03.422 --> 00:15:07.289\nyou're pointing it over the boot,\nover the optical drive itself to boot.\n\n286\n00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:10.380\nAnd it isn't a bootable disk,\nwell it's attempting,\n\n287\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.655\nyour bios might be attempting to boot\nto that optical drive and it's saying,\n\n288\n00:15:14.655 --> 00:15:19.530\nI don't see an NBR here, all right,\nso that could be the problem as well.\n\n289\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.850\nThe other problem could be too,\n\n290\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.910\nis that maybe you're attempting\nto boot to a USB device.\n\n291\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.850\nI've done this before many times\nwhere I've left a USB external drive\n\n292\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.480\nplugged into my machine, all right.\n\n293\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.930\nAnd I've seen some BIOSes that it\ndidn't matter if that USB device was\n\n294\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.000\nbootable or not.\n\n295\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.312\nI did this one time, Dan,\n\n296\n00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:40.247\nwhere I had actually some of\nmy media on an external drive.\n\n297\n00:15:40.247 --> 00:15:43.827\nIt had nothing to do with,\nno boot media right, on it all.\n\n298\n00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:47.271\nAnd when I turn on my computer,\nit kept looking at that external drive and\n\n299\n00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:51.899\nit paused the whole boot All right, it was\nreally to determine how that little USB\n\n300\n00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:54.857\nkick out some more happenings\nsystem you knew didn't exist.\n\n301\n00:15:54.857 --> 00:15:55.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n302\n00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.780\nwe would get things like OS not found,\nright?\n\n303\n00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.100\nAnd [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; Like the, dah!\n\n304\n00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n305\n00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.040\nIt's like well be smarter.\n\n306\n00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.420\nLook for the boot record.\n\n307\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.030\nDon't be looking for\nmy Miley Cyrus videos.\n\n308\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.960\nJust kidding guys, no.\n\n309\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.680\n[LAUGH] So some of the things that\nwe gotta keep in mind as well,\n\n310\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.500\nis that it could be a USB device\nthat is put into the drive.\n\n311\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.775\nIn fact, I gotta off camera here and\nthis is one\n\n312\n00:16:18.775 --> 00:16:22.045\nthat is kind of unique in a way, this one\nthat we have here is called an ISO stick.\n\n313\n00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:25.565\nAlright, this is essentially\na bootable media and\n\n314\n00:16:25.565 --> 00:16:28.295\nthis device here is made to be just that.\n\n315\n00:16:28.295 --> 00:16:30.110\nIt's optimized for bootable medium.\n\n316\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.580\nBut, right.\n\n317\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.570\nWould the prevalence of usb flash drives\nand the lack of optical drives guess what?\n\n318\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.250\nWe have had to do this quite\na few times around here.\n\n319\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.910\nIn fact Dan and I on my computer here,\nwe don't even have an optical drive.\n\n320\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.360\nSo, how do we get the operating system?\n\n321\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.040\nWell, MAC is a little bit different,\nMAC you can just go into the app store and\n\n322\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.310\nyou can download your operating system,\nbut you can also boot to USB.\n\n323\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.780\nAll right, windows are now doing stuffs\nmany year windows are operating systems on\n\n324\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.410\ndevices that didn't have the optical drive\nin it or the optical drive was failing and\n\n325\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.200\nwe still need it to get an operating\nsystem on it regardless of the fact,\n\n326\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.200\nthe optical drive that failed.\n\n327\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.290\nGuess what, you plug this thing in and\nit's bootable and then in your boot\n\n328\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:13.720\nsequence your USB device is set prior to\nthe hard drive, it's gonna look here.\n\n329\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.730\nRight?\nIn fact, here after a bit,\n\n330\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.090\nI'm not sure if we'll get to it here in\nthis part here, but we're gonna show you.\n\n331\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.840\nWe're gonna show you exactly\nwhat can happen with that.\n\n332\n00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.410\nSo I do want you to keep in mind that\nthere are many different things,\n\n333\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.630\nwell a few different things, a handful\nof things that could cause your computer\n\n334\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.420\nto attempt to boot to the wrong device,\nthe incorrect device.\n\n335\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.750\nAll right, sometimes it can be as simple\nas it moves passed those devices.\n\n336\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.650\nRight?\n\n337\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.510\nA computer that I've got,\nthat's a little bit newer, right,\n\n338\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.200\nit'll look at the optical drive,\nif one is present,\n\n339\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.210\ndoesn't find a master boot record,\ndoesn't find the GUI partition table,\n\n340\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.590\nit says, it's not there,\nlet's just move on to the next device.\n\n341\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.280\nRight?\n\n342\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.190\nThen, it moves to the USB device.\n\n343\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.660\nHey there's a USB device plugged in right?\n\n344\n00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.650\nI found Wes's heavy metal music there, but\n\n345\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.800\nI didn't find a single bit of an operating\nsystem or any kind of boot record.\n\n346\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.790\nThat's okay,\nwe'll just move next down on the list.\n\n347\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.965\nWe're gonna look at the network adaptor.\n\n348\n00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:07.325\nAll right.\n\n349\n00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:10.375\nThe network adapter you start seeing\na little firm ware that loads up, and\n\n350\n00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:11.585\nin fact Intel does this too,\n\n351\n00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:15.325\nwhere it says Intel rom pixie\nboot pre execution environment.\n\n352\n00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:19.305\nWhen that happens, it's looking out,\nit's calling out to the network adaptor.\n\n353\n00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:23.575\nIt's loading a little bit of\na little protocol called bootp and\n\n354\n00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:25.545\nit's calling out to all\nthe other networks, saying,\n\n355\n00:18:25.545 --> 00:18:28.295\n\"hey,anybody got an operating system\nout there, I'm really looking for\n\n356\n00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:33.210\none.\" Right, and it doesn't find one\nthere, it moves finally to the hard drive.\n\n357\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.310\nNow, if it doesn't find it on the hard\ndrive, you know you've got an operating\n\n358\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.870\nsystem and nothing else is working,\nchances are you have a corrupted mbr.\n\n359\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.060\nAnd again, this could be many other\ndifferent things that we talk about in our\n\n360\n00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.000\nhardware section, right?\n\n361\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.080\nFire risk could be one them.\n\n362\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.430\nSure, it could be a failing drive.\n\n363\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.140\nIt could be a corrupted\nmaster boot record.\n\n364\n00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.730\nAll right, so, those are a few of the\ndifferent things that you have to worry\n\n365\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.360\nabout when it comes to boot, right?\n\n366\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.610\nWhere are we booting to, okay?\n\n367\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.070\nNow, here's some of the other things,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.670\nNo power.\n\n369\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.170\nI reach over and I press the power button.\n\n370\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.720\nWhat's the problem?\n\n371\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.410\nAlright, we said simple fixes first.\n\n372\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.920\nWhat's the first thing I should check?\n\n373\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.082\nDan, want to guess, if I push the power\nbutton and I have no power on the machine?\n\n374\n00:19:13.082 --> 00:19:16.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with the cable first,\nor if it's a laptop, maybe a battery.\n\n375\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n376\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.250\nRight, yeah, definitely, right.\n\n377\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.160\nAnd to expand on the laptop battery, many\nof them have the integrated batteries in\n\n378\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.320\nthem does it even have\nthe battery plugged in at all?\n\n379\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.810\nRight?\nSo, yeah, simple fixes first.\n\n380\n00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.120\nDon't overlook that.\n\n381\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.360\nDon't overlook it in the real world, and\ncertainly don't overlook it on the exam\n\n382\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.545\nbecause simplicity says they might\njust be asking you, exactly that.\n\n383\n00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.635\nAre you starting there first?\n\n384\n00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:42.165\nQuestion the obvious, I think is\none of the things in the Comp-TIA\n\n385\n00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:44.015\ntroubleshooting model that we talk about.\n\n386\n00:19:44.015 --> 00:19:46.215\nQuestion the obvious, okay?\n\n387\n00:19:46.215 --> 00:19:49.435\nNow, if you have no power, there's\nother things that cause that as well.\n\n388\n00:19:49.435 --> 00:19:51.175\nIs your power supply bad?\n\n389\n00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:52.675\nAlright.\nOne of the things that could happen if\n\n390\n00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:55.910\nyou power supply is bad,\nis that the fan spins, but\n\n391\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.180\nyou still have no power\nto the motherboard.\n\n392\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.850\nNow, that could be a motherboard that's\nfailed to, so this is where you have to\n\n393\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.960\nbreak out your multimeter, right, and you\nhave to start testing the power supply and\n\n394\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.620\nmaking sure if it's giving you\nthe voltage that you expect, right?\n\n395\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.410\nSo, that can be an issue as well.\n\n396\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.280\nAll right, so simple fixes first.\n\n397\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.480\nPower supply could be bad,\n\n398\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.090\nmotherboard could be bad,\nare the cables plugged in, all right?\n\n399\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.190\nIt is important to keep in mind.\n\n400\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.910\nNow, the other thing that they also\ncall out is a loud noise, all right?\n\n401\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.010\nAnd there's a couple things\nthat cause loud noise.\n\n402\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.760\nRemember that your fans\nhave bearings in them.\n\n403\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.540\nAlright, sometimes they're\nceramic bearings right?\n\n404\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.590\nBut either way we have moving and\nspinning parts.\n\n405\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.580\nAnd anytime you have a moving and\nspinning part, if it starts to whine and\n\n406\n00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.100\ncry at you in loud noise,\nmeans that its failing, alright?\n\n407\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.690\nIf it's a power supply,\ndo not open it, alright?\n\n408\n00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.490\nWhen it comes to power issues you do not\nmess with power supplies unless you work\n\n409\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.690\nfor the power supply company,\nmanufacturer if you will,\n\n410\n00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.310\nunless you are a trained\nelectrical engineer.\n\n411\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.370\nAlright, I know enough about power\nto let the professionals handle it.\n\n412\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.510\nElectricity is dangerous and\nthere's capacitors inside.\n\n413\n00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.620\nOf a power supply, that just simple\ncontact could stop your heart.\n\n414\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.550\nThe power supply can always be replaced,\nyou can not.\n\n415\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.150\nNow, I don't mean to be all\nphilosophical on this one, but remember\n\n416\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.650\nI don't care what the cost of the power\nsupply is, it is not worth your life.\n\n417\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.310\nSo, be very careful on that,\ndon't open it up.\n\n418\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.090\nAll right, other loud noises that\ncan happen, and could have an up,\n\n419\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.660\nyou can have something debri that\nis falling down into the computer,\n\n420\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.060\nis falling in to the CPU fan right?\n\n421\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.595\nAnd if it's starts you know sounds like\nthe old, I'm gonna really age myself here.\n\n422\n00:21:41.595 --> 00:21:44.265\nIt sounds like you are going down\non your BMX that you used to have,\n\n423\n00:21:44.265 --> 00:21:45.285\nyour Mongoose or something.\n\n424\n00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:49.545\nYou put the card in the wheels to make it\nsound like an engine, or a flapping noise.\n\n425\n00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:51.655\nThat could be a fact that\nyou've got debris in there, and\n\n426\n00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:54.715\nthat can happen at a tech bench.\n\n427\n00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:58.085\nMaybe not so common in the home\nenvironment unless you are constantly\n\n428\n00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:00.715\nopening your computer, but\nit can certainly happen on a tech bench.\n\n429\n00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:01.780\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; cockroaches.\n\n430\n00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.040\nThey love to get inside of a computer and\n\n431\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.840\nfind some little place\nthey shouldn't be in.\n\n432\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.350\n&gt;&gt; And in Florida,\nthey're big enough that,\n\n433\n00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.540\nthat could probably make\na very loud noise, right?\n\n434\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.210\nAnd so, that could happen, right.\n\n435\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.290\nThe other thing that could happen, too,\n\n436\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.340\nis you pay attention to the way you route\nyour cables within the computer itself.\n\n437\n00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.510\nAgain, cables tend to\nsometimes settle over time\n\n438\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.090\nif you've just recently replaced a part.\n\n439\n00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.890\nAnd you've got a cable\nthat's down in a fan.\n\n440\n00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.610\nThat could be a lot.\n\n441\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.420\nA lot of times it's anything\nthat's moving apart.\n\n442\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.930\nIf you've got a loud noise and\nif it isn't a hard drive.\n\n443\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.630\nRight, if it hadn't\ncrashed in the hard drive.\n\n444\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.620\nRight, the clicking.\n\n445\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.290\nNoise if you will, sure.\n\n446\n00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.250\nRight again, we've addressed that\nalready in our hard drive episodes.\n\n447\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.140\nBut, a lot of times what it's gonna\nbe is it's gonna be some kind of fan.\n\n448\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.670\nNow, it could be some kind of pump,\nif you have liquid cooling.\n\n449\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.290\nBut for most part those\nare the things that you might hear.\n\n450\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.660\nAll right, now I mentioned fan spin.\n\n451\n00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.720\nCould be a couple of things.\n\n452\n00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.680\nIf we talk about fans spinning and\nnothing else is happening.\n\n453\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.130\nWell, again, keep in mind that there could\nbe times that the power supply has failed,\n\n454\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.000\ncould be the motherboard has failed.\n\n455\n00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.830\nI can tell you something that I've\nactually seen that has happened is when\n\n456\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.040\nI've had Molex connectors\nto the system fans.\n\n457\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.510\nRemember, they're not\ncontrolled by the motherboard.\n\n458\n00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.640\nNot at all.\nIn fact they're controlled because it's\n\n459\n00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.910\na direct power line coming\nright off the power supply.\n\n460\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.200\nSo, if the motherboard fails and the\nsystem fans that are connected to the four\n\n461\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.110\npin and three pin molex KK connectors\non the motherboard don't spin,\n\n462\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.290\nyou can still see that the ones that\nare connected to the power supply spin.\n\n463\n00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.330\nSo, fan's spinning you have no power,\nright,\n\n464\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.910\nthat could be a sign that\nthe motherboard is failing.\n\n465\n00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.867\nAll right?\n\n466\n00:23:39.867 --> 00:23:42.154\nPower supplies itself,\nif the fan is spinning and\n\n467\n00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:45.490\nyou're having no power again like I\nsaid power supply might be failing.\n\n468\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.689\nNo power to other devices.\n\n469\n00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:53.369\nAll right, when you have a multi-railed\nsystem, power supply if you will,\n\n470\n00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:54.669\ndual-rail system.\n\n471\n00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:56.611\nEssentially what this means is that,\n\n472\n00:23:56.611 --> 00:24:00.252\nthat little spaghetti that's coming\noff the back of the power supply,\n\n473\n00:24:00.252 --> 00:24:03.606\nit's connected to different traces\ninside of the power supply.\n\n474\n00:24:03.606 --> 00:24:05.034\nAnd if one of those traces fails,\n\n475\n00:24:05.034 --> 00:24:07.081\nyou could have one of\nthose rails that has died.\n\n476\n00:24:07.081 --> 00:24:10.574\nAnd if that happens, then you could\nhave half of your components.\n\n477\n00:24:10.574 --> 00:24:14.404\nOr the components that are connected\nto that rail are no longer operational\n\n478\n00:24:14.404 --> 00:24:18.680\nversus maybe the main power rail to\nthe motherboard is still functional.\n\n479\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.590\nSo that could happen too.\n\n480\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.126\nNow, we're gonna take this back\nto simplicity's sake as well.\n\n481\n00:24:23.126 --> 00:24:28.226\nAnd I want you to keep in mind that\nwhen it comes down to no power\n\n482\n00:24:28.226 --> 00:24:33.200\nto other devices,\nother devices connected, all right?\n\n483\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.441\nThat could be a very common thing.\n\n484\n00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:40.374\nEspecially in a multi-disk system or maybe\nyou have a ray to ray that's configured.\n\n485\n00:24:40.374 --> 00:24:43.766\nAnd you have more than one hard drive and\nyou just get in a hurry,\n\n486\n00:24:43.766 --> 00:24:45.250\nI mean it happens, right?\n\n487\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.465\nAnd you don't plug the power into\nthe device fully, optical drive,\n\n488\n00:24:48.465 --> 00:24:49.468\nsame thing, right?\n\n489\n00:24:49.468 --> 00:24:51.150\nThat could cause problems.\n\n490\n00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:56.022\nIf you do have one of the gender bender\ntype male female daisy chains of\n\n491\n00:24:56.022 --> 00:25:00.558\nmolex connectors, you could have\none of those molex connectors\n\n492\n00:25:00.558 --> 00:25:03.360\nwithin that chain that has failed.\n\n493\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.602\nAnd it's not passing power\nto the other devices, right,\n\n494\n00:25:05.602 --> 00:25:07.730\nit stops at a certain point in the chain.\n\n495\n00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:12.630\nIf you have one of these splitters, there\nare times where maybe you're running short\n\n496\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:18.500\non your connections for\nmaybe a serial ATA drive configuration.\n\n497\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.664\nSo you put a splitter on it, right, and\nit takes one of the 15 pin connectors and\n\n498\n00:25:22.664 --> 00:25:24.885\nsplits it to two,\nwhere one of them is bad.\n\n499\n00:25:24.885 --> 00:25:29.034\nThat sometimes even happens because\nyou're trying to save money and\n\n500\n00:25:29.034 --> 00:25:31.405\nyou get a very cheap splitter, right?\n\n501\n00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:35.959\nAnd when you get a cheap splitter there\nis a tendency for, and I've seen this as\n\n502\n00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:40.927\nwell, where you're taking and unplugging\nand then you re-plug the connector in and\n\n503\n00:25:40.927 --> 00:25:45.550\nthe pins on the back side of the actual\nconnector itself, the plastic housing,\n\n504\n00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.130\nactually pull out.\n\n505\n00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.390\nAnd even though you've connected it,\n\n506\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.530\nthe pin itself that is inside of that\nconnector has literally pulled itself out,\n\n507\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.010\nand then unfortunately you get\nno power to the device too.\n\n508\n00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.760\nAll right, so there are many\nother things that can happen.\n\n509\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.901\nI'll tell you real quick Dan here, one\nthat I know we're running short on time\n\n510\n00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:08.364\nhere, proprietary screen crashes, right?\n\n511\n00:26:08.364 --> 00:26:10.900\nThese are called kernel panics.\n\n512\n00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.821\nYou will hear them called\nmany other things, right?\n\n513\n00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:16.220\nYou'll hear them called\nblue screen of death.\n\n514\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:21.110\nInside a Mac they talk about the pin\nwheel, which is a colored wheel that just\n\n515\n00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.420\nsits there and kind of spins and\ndoesn't do anything.\n\n516\n00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.386\nWhen you have the blue screen,\nBSOD as they call it, it doesn't matter,\n\n517\n00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:29.590\ncall it kernel panic.\n\n518\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.390\nThis a lot of the times will happen when\nyour CPU issues a general protection\n\n519\n00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.041\nfault, and it's a stop error.\n\n520\n00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:37.744\nAll right, inside of Windows\nit generates a blue screen.\n\n521\n00:26:37.744 --> 00:26:42.268\nRestarts the machine after it performs\na memory dump inside of your Mac systems,\n\n522\n00:26:42.268 --> 00:26:46.140\nyou can get a pin wheel and then all\nof a sudden the computer restarts.\n\n523\n00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.227\nAnd when it restarts, it gives you\na little low text that says your computer\n\n524\n00:26:49.227 --> 00:26:51.150\nhas just recovered from\nsome kind of failure.\n\n525\n00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:55.105\nAnd it does a memory dump as well,\nand that's just taking everything\n\n526\n00:26:55.105 --> 00:26:59.690\nthat was in RAM at that time, dumping it\ninto a file and then you have the option.\n\n527\n00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.439\nIn Windows it really doesn't do anything,\n\n528\n00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:04.430\nI think the Windows Error Reporting\nService will send it out in Microsoft.\n\n529\n00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.630\nAnd in Macs I believe, Macs you can click\non a button, you can send it out to Apple.\n\n530\n00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.979\nI'm not sure Dan,\nI know you worked in Linux before.\n\n531\n00:27:11.979 --> 00:27:14.994\nI think we had mentioned, I had asked\nyou this before, in the terminal,\n\n532\n00:27:14.994 --> 00:27:15.990\nit just hangs, right?\n\n533\n00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.816\nWhen it does a kernel panic, some kinda,\n\n534\n00:27:17.816 --> 00:27:19.963\nwhat we would consider\na blue screen in Windows?\n\n535\n00:27:19.963 --> 00:27:23.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'll just,\nyou might get some error messages, or\n\n536\n00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.023\nit will just freeze up on it.\n\n537\n00:27:25.023 --> 00:27:27.625\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's why they say proprietary,\n\n538\n00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:31.331\ncuz no one system is gonna do it\nthemselves, right, or I'm sorry,\n\n539\n00:27:31.331 --> 00:27:34.210\nis it gonna be consistent\nacross the board, right?\n\n540\n00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.158\nWhen it comes down to it,\nit's called a kernel panic and\n\n541\n00:27:37.158 --> 00:27:39.241\nevery operating system can have them.\n\n542\n00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:41.500\nSome have them less often than others.\n\n543\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.062\nSo like we've already mentioned,\nLinux is a very stable operating system.\n\n544\n00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:48.189\nIt's one of the reasons you commonly find\nthat on servers that are on the back bone\n\n545\n00:27:48.189 --> 00:27:49.470\nof the Internet as well.\n\n546\n00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.572\nAll right, so those are some things,\n\n547\n00:27:51.572 --> 00:27:56.050\nI think one of the last things I want to\nkind of talk about here real briefly, Dan.\n\n548\n00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.429\nI know we're coming to\nthe end of the episode.\n\n549\n00:27:57.429 --> 00:28:01.489\nThey do mention light indicators or\nindicator lights, if you will,\n\n550\n00:28:01.489 --> 00:28:03.590\nand there's all different kinds.\n\n551\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.348\nIn fact we've got a Dell Optiflex 980\nsitting up here and if we go to the sky\n\n552\n00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:11.481\ncam, what you can't see is that, well,\nI don't have any indicators right here.\n\n553\n00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:13.896\nBut if I was to press power\non this you'll see, well,\n\n554\n00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:15.975\nthere's a couple of different indicators.\n\n555\n00:28:15.975 --> 00:28:17.300\nIt's got all different kinds, right?\n\n556\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.630\nThis is kind of unique to Dell, so\n\n557\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.630\ndon't think that this is gonna be\nthe same thing across the board.\n\n558\n00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.437\nYou can see a few little\nindicators right there.\n\n559\n00:28:23.437 --> 00:28:24.880\nAnd you can see some numbers.\n\n560\n00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.360\nAnd I'm not exactly sure off the top\nof my head what those numbers really\n\n561\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.290\neven are, right?\n\n562\n00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.184\nWell, one of the great things is\nyou can always go out to Dell and\n\n563\n00:28:32.184 --> 00:28:33.010\nyou can find out.\n\n564\n00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.813\nHey, what are these little\nnumeric codes here?\n\n565\n00:28:35.813 --> 00:28:39.460\nAnd they have them out there for\nthe Optiplex series.\n\n566\n00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.792\nBut I also see a hard drive indicator over\nhere, and this could change in its colors.\n\n567\n00:28:43.792 --> 00:28:46.270\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna power cycle this one down.\n\n568\n00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.929\nAnd I don't know if it'll do it in post.\n\n569\n00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:55.270\nThe Optiplex series which is kind of\ninteresting, they have a pre-post, and\n\n570\n00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.684\nI always joke around\nthey have a post post.\n\n571\n00:28:57.684 --> 00:29:01.167\n[LAUGH] So, when you shut the computer\ndown under a graceless shutdown,\n\n572\n00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:03.605\nit'll actually run these indicators again,\nand\n\n573\n00:29:03.605 --> 00:29:06.521\nit'll check itself after\nyou've shut the computer down.\n\n574\n00:29:06.521 --> 00:29:10.825\nBut you could see this, believe it or not\nwe'll go ahead and try this one more time.\n\n575\n00:29:10.825 --> 00:29:14.792\nThat's actually, notice that it went\nreal briefly from amber to blue.\n\n576\n00:29:14.792 --> 00:29:17.403\nThere's actually a power\nindicator in there too.\n\n577\n00:29:17.403 --> 00:29:21.352\nIf it starts to, I've seen these,\nI've had to work on these in the past and\n\n578\n00:29:21.352 --> 00:29:25.681\ndo Dell warranty calls, where that power\nlight there will change amber colors and\n\n579\n00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:26.950\nit'll flash.\n\n580\n00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.910\nAnd that usually is indicative of\nsome kind of power supply issue or\n\n581\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.314\nmotherboard connection to\nthe main power source there.\n\n582\n00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:36.800\nAnd you can also see just briefly here.\n\n583\n00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.453\nAnd I'm gonna have to reinstall the\noperating system once I'm done with this\n\n584\n00:29:40.453 --> 00:29:41.359\nmachine for sure.\n\n585\n00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:42.856\nBut you could also see as well,\n\n586\n00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:46.780\nas it comes on, you can see that we have\nthe hard drive light indicator down here.\n\n587\n00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.597\nAnd as well, we have the optical drive\nkind of doing it's little thing.\n\n588\n00:29:50.597 --> 00:29:55.020\nSo you also have different\nindicator lights.\n\n589\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.800\nAgain, they can be very, very basic\nlike the hard drive that we've seen\n\n590\n00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.770\nover here that lets me know,\nhey, this thing is running.\n\n591\n00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.485\nIt could turn red, I've seen some\nsystems where if it's blinking red,\n\n592\n00:30:06.485 --> 00:30:09.200\nthat symbolizes some kind\nof hard drive failure.\n\n593\n00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.070\nIf you're talking about storage arrays in\nyour server closets and stuff like that,\n\n594\n00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.188\nyou might see that you have a series\nof hard drive light indicators.\n\n595\n00:30:16.188 --> 00:30:19.513\nAnd they could all be blue,\nor green for that matter, and\n\n596\n00:30:19.513 --> 00:30:23.671\nthen you might find one that's\nblinking red, and that could be again,\n\n597\n00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:28.312\na tell tale sign that one of the drives\nin that storage array has failed.\n\n598\n00:30:28.312 --> 00:30:33.190\nAnd again, the numeric codes that you see\nhere, again don't think of them too much.\n\n599\n00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.034\nThere we go, I got beep, beep there and\nI believe that means that this one,\n\n600\n00:30:37.034 --> 00:30:39.790\nthis Dell just successfully\nwent through post.\n\n601\n00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.082\nI have, or\nit could be a keyboard failure Dan.\n\n602\n00:30:43.082 --> 00:30:46.768\nAnd we were actually talking about this\ncuz I don't have a keyboard hooked\n\n603\n00:30:46.768 --> 00:30:47.770\nup to this.\n\n604\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.829\nSo I don't know if you guys could\nhear that in the background there but\n\n605\n00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:52.427\nthat was actually a post beep code.\n\n606\n00:30:52.427 --> 00:30:54.634\nAnd if I did a couple of short beeps,\n\n607\n00:30:54.634 --> 00:30:57.905\nif I look that up I could\nprobably tell you what it is.\n\n608\n00:30:57.905 --> 00:31:01.151\nBut we're gonna save that for maybe a part\nthree cuz we got a couple of other things\n\n609\n00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:02.693\nthat we wanna actually show you here.\n\n610\n00:31:02.693 --> 00:31:04.884\nBecause we've talked a lot about stuff,\n\n611\n00:31:04.884 --> 00:31:08.460\nwe're gonna try to generate some\nof these errors here and show you.\n\n612\n00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.760\nAnd I guess show you, listen to it and\nyou can hear what's going on.\n\n613\n00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.620\nAnd I'd also like to take you through\na little bit of how you could\n\n614\n00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:22.330\ntroubleshoot the power on a power\nsupply specifically with a multimeter.\n\n615\n00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.809\nAs well as we're gonna\nmail Dan a postcard.\n\n616\n00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:28.676\nJust kidding, we actually have one of\nthese postcards here that we wanna kinda\n\n617\n00:31:28.676 --> 00:31:31.680\nshow you guys where you can kinda\nget an idea on diagnostics.\n\n618\n00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.259\nBut unfortunately, Dan, I think I've\ntalked a lot in this episode, and\n\n619\n00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:35.559\nI don't know if we have enough time.\n\n620\n00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:39.039\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely don't have enough\ntime for this to continue this episode,\n\n621\n00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:40.790\nwe'll have to continue in a part three.\n\n622\n00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:41.925\nSo definitely join us back for that.\n\n623\n00:31:41.925 --> 00:31:44.373\nBut, Wes great information so far, and\n\n624\n00:31:44.373 --> 00:31:48.626\nwe look forward to seeing the culmination\nof this particular domain.\n\n625\n00:31:48.626 --> 00:31:52.025\nThanks for joining us everyone, signing\noff for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n626\n00:31:52.025 --> 00:31:52.750\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n627\n00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.897\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:31:53.897 --> 00:32:01.817\n[MUSIC]\n\n629\n00:32:01.817 --> 00:32:04.364\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:07.581\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:10.639\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.245\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:17.390\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.280\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode, it's all about the A+ series,\n\n8\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.440\nthat's right, always back for the good\nold 22901, don't you just love it?\n\n9\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.198\nLet's just ruminate in it.\n\n10\n00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:31.228\nAnd here to help us [LAUGH] stew in that\njuice is our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:32.732\nWes, we're glad to have you back today,\nand how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:33.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, now you're making me hungry.\n\n13\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm thinking stew, that's for sure.\n\n14\n00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.072\n&gt;&gt; I gotta have food.\n\n15\n00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:38.478\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right-\n\n16\n00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:39.746\n&gt;&gt; Cut the camera!\n\n17\n00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:40.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're gonna\n\n18\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.009\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna move into part three,\n\n19\n00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.854\nas you can see here.\n\n20\n00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:47.505\nAnd we've been talking about some\ndifferent issues that you can face with\n\n21\n00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.620\nyour motherboards, and CPUs, and RAM.\n\n22\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.692\nAnd we've shown some stuff,\nbut we really wanna kinda,\n\n23\n00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:56.572\nin this last part,\nkinda show you some of the things,\n\n24\n00:00:56.572 --> 00:01:00.020\nthe physical hands-on parts\nthat you might end up seeing.\n\n25\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.614\nWhen it comes to being\nsome kinda A+ technician,\n\n26\n00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:05.780\nor if you're working the tech bench or\nmaybe even help desk.\n\n27\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.340\nSo that's really what we're gonna\ntake care of here in this last part,\n\n28\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.230\nguys and gals, cuz we've been saying that.\n\n29\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.860\nAnd well, we've just been, the\ncliffhangers right there towards the end.\n\n30\n00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.920\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; We keep promising and not delivering.\n\n31\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.906\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Today's the day, this is the show.\n\n32\n00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:25.510\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna make like Cliff\nthe mailman and delivery has arrived.\n\n33\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.222\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n34\n00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:26.868\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n35\n00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:29.475\nyeah, some of you guys\nmight understand that.\n\n36\n00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:30.740\nSome of you, it's like, Cliff, who's he?\n\n37\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.255\nBut go check it out for sure.\n\n38\n00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:33.045\n&gt;&gt; Cliff Clavin.\n\n39\n00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:35.055\n&gt;&gt; Google will be your friend on that one,\nfor sure.\n\n40\n00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.015\n&gt;&gt; Google Cliff Clavin.\n\n41\n00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:38.365\n&gt;&gt; So when we talk about some\nof the issues that you can face,\n\n42\n00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.395\nsome of the things that you could see.\n\n43\n00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:43.745\nOne of the things that we had talked\nabout in the previous episodes\n\n44\n00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:48.740\nwas your BIOS time and settings are reset.\n\n45\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.760\nRight now,\ndon't let that term BIOS time confuse you.\n\n46\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.729\nBecause I also said CMOS settings.\n\n47\n00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.150\nSo what are we talking about?\n\n48\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.130\nJust remember that when\nthey say BIOS time,\n\n49\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.360\ngenerically you might even\nhear the term BIOS CMOS, and\n\n50\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.500\nthose are just because they use\nthem interchangeably today, right?\n\n51\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.959\nAnd that's just the fact that that\ncomplementary metal oxide semiconductor is\n\n52\n00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.564\nwhat really is helping you to\nretain the user defined settings.\n\n53\n00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:18.729\nAnd in the BIOS ROM chip, read only\nmemory, you've electrically flashed or\n\n54\n00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.980\nelectrically programmed the EEPROM chip\nto retain those firmware settings.\n\n55\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.470\nSo again,\nkinda using them interchangeably.\n\n56\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.402\nKeep in mind that it is the CMOS battery\nthat is what provides the voltage for\n\n57\n00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.823\nthose settings.\n\n58\n00:02:33.823 --> 00:02:37.701\nNow one of the things that we went ahead\nand did is we've got a computer up here.\n\n59\n00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:39.213\nAnd if we could take a look at it,\n\n60\n00:02:39.213 --> 00:02:42.810\nyou could see that we've got kind of\nlike the side already taken apart here.\n\n61\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.774\nAnd we're gonna show you some of the\ntools, because that's one of the things\n\n62\n00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:48.337\nthey talk about in the objectives\nis using the appropriate tools.\n\n63\n00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:52.250\nWell one of the tools that we have is\nwhat is known as the power on self test.\n\n64\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.289\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nkinda show you what you would see.\n\n65\n00:02:55.289 --> 00:03:00.180\nLet's say, for instance, if you were\nfirst of all maybe replacing one of these\n\n66\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.560\nbatteries for the very first time or\nthe battery had outright failed and\n\n67\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.243\nthen you had to replace it.\n\n68\n00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:07.647\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:07.647 --> 00:03:11.750\nwe're gonna start up this machine and what\nwe want you to see is the post screen.\n\n70\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.537\nNow you'll notice if we bring\nup that post screen, right,\n\n71\n00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:17.792\nwell, you know the computer screen,\nit's gonna be blank, right?\n\n72\n00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:21.357\nIt's going to be pretty much all blank,\nwe're not gonna see anything,\n\n73\n00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:24.830\nwhat we're gonna end up seeing is\nreally just a black screen, right?\n\n74\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.420\nAnd that's okay, because\nthe machine doesn't have any power.\n\n75\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.260\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the power screen.\n\n76\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.810\nAll right, Dan,\n\n77\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.252\nthis is what we should be seeing if we\ndon't have any power on the machine here.\n\n78\n00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:39.709\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is we will power this machine up and\n\n79\n00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.050\nwe should see some kind of\nBIOS screen come up, right?\n\n80\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.375\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll press power.\n\n81\n00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:49.745\nAnd sometimes it takes a little bit to\nsee the screen depending on what kind of\n\n82\n00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:52.010\nfirmware that you have in the machine.\n\n83\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.415\nSometimes you might have a dual\nfirmware and if it's in the process of\n\n84\n00:03:55.415 --> 00:03:58.644\nrebuilding one of the BIOS,\nif they ended up getting corrupted,\n\n85\n00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:00.896\nit could take a good bit\nto even see anything.\n\n86\n00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:06.385\nNow you can see that it is trying to\ngo through its basic boot, right.\n\n87\n00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:10.030\nAnd notice right away, this is something\nthat we kinda wanted you to see.\n\n88\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.290\nNotice it says performing\nautomatic IDE configuration.\n\n89\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.372\nNow, why is it performing some\nkind of automatic configuration?\n\n90\n00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:22.730\nWell, it should already have\nconfigurations stored, right?\n\n91\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.560\nAnd now it's trying to check hard drives,\nand notice we get a failure here.\n\n92\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.111\nAnd if we look at what that failure says,\ntime-of-day not set,\n\n93\n00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:32.880\nplease run the SETUP program.\n\n94\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.317\nNotice that it also says Invalid\nconfiguration information, and\n\n95\n00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.065\nagain you guys can read\nalong with me out there.\n\n96\n00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:39.310\nPlease run the SETUP program.\n\n97\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.490\nAnd then again in that next sentence it\nsays system management hardware requires\n\n98\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.640\na reset, right?\n\n99\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.490\nSystem set up configuration and date and\ntime require attention after the reset.\n\n100\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.635\nSo what's going on here, all right?\n\n101\n00:04:50.635 --> 00:04:55.409\nWell, what's going on is this little\nbattery that we have inside of\n\n102\n00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.450\nthe motherboard has failed to do its job,\nright?\n\n103\n00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.819\nAnd this is indicative of some\nkind of CMOS battery failure.\n\n104\n00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.320\nNow what battery do I mean?\n\n105\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.521\nWell, I've actually got one\nright here in my hands, right?\n\n106\n00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:07.920\nThis is it, right?\n\n107\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.270\nIt's a little CR I believe CR 2032\nthree volt watch battery, right?\n\n108\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.420\nThere's nothing really special about it.\n\n109\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.460\nExcept for in your computer,\nthere's something very special about it.\n\n110\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.120\nIt's holding all of these configurations,\nand now that we don't have power\n\n111\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.620\nto those configurations, volatile memory,\nright, even if it's low voltage.\n\n112\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.180\nIf it's volatile memory,\nno voltage means no configuration.\n\n113\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.290\nSo this is what you can see if you have\nthe BIOS settings are reset like they say,\n\n114\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.795\nthe BIOS time and settings keep resetting,\n\n115\n00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:43.050\nthat basically means this is the problem,\nthis is the little battery, right?\n\n116\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.470\nAnd one of the things that you also\nwanna keep in mind is that in the home\n\n117\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.860\nenvironment, again,\n\n118\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.320\nsometimes I've seen where where we\nhaven't ever changed these at all.\n\n119\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.380\nBut in a production environment, that's\nnot something you wanna risk, right?\n\n120\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.430\nEspecially when we're talking\nabout server closets, right?\n\n121\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.090\nAnd we're talking about server closets\nwhere you have a potential of thousands of\n\n122\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.410\nservers.\n\n123\n00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.331\nIf even one of those servers goes\noffline and you don't have some kind of\n\n124\n00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:06.544\nredundancy, not likely that you wouldn't\nhave some kind of redundancy, but\n\n125\n00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:08.602\nit could cause a very,\nvery bad day at the office.\n\n126\n00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:12.530\nNot for just you as a tech, but\nalso for the company, right?\n\n127\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.420\nAs you guys go on to additional\ntraining here at the CompTIA level,\n\n128\n00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.640\nyou'll progress through Net+ and\nSecurity+.\n\n129\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.230\nYou'll learn about business continuity,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.780\nWell, your business can't continue\nif we have issues like that.\n\n131\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.860\nSo, that's one of things that we\ncan hear in the post error code.\n\n132\n00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.660\nYou heard the little beep right there.\n\n133\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.400\nIt's giving me,\ntelling me something is wrong.\n\n134\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.245\nAnd that's some of the things\nthat you could see.\n\n135\n00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:36.540\nSo, keep in mind that you\nhave those audible beeps.\n\n136\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.210\nNow that's not the only audible\nbeep that you could hear too.\n\n137\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.438\nWhat if you end up having memory issues?\n\n138\n00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:43.145\nAll right, well if you have memory issues,\n\n139\n00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:45.140\nthose will give you certain\ntypes of beeps as well.\n\n140\n00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.270\nAnd like Dan and\nI have already stated, keep in mind,\n\n141\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.270\nthere is a consistency in inconsistency,\nif that makes sense.\n\n142\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.018\nBetween the manufacturers on what kind\nof codes, error codes you'll hear.\n\n143\n00:06:56.018 --> 00:07:02.120\nFor instance, Dell,\nthey're basically like an IBM PC BIOS.\n\n144\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.996\nThey still have the traditional PC BIOS,\nbut they have their own dedicated codes.\n\n145\n00:07:06.996 --> 00:07:09.760\nHP's one that's got a very limited,\nyou know, amount.\n\n146\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.506\nSo again, pay attention to that.\n\n147\n00:07:11.506 --> 00:07:14.674\nSo let's go ahead, and what we're gonna\ndo next is we're gonna figure out,\n\n148\n00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:16.937\nwhat happens if something\ngoes wrong with our memory?\n\n149\n00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.250\nDo we get some kind of\npost audible beep there?\n\n150\n00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.174\nIs it something we can tell when\nit runs that self diagnostic?\n\n151\n00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.530\nSo we'll go ahead and\ntake a look at that next.\n\n152\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.521\nAll right, Dan, so I think what I'm\ngonna do is simulate a failure that\n\n153\n00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:31.446\ncan kind of happen if a tech\ngets into kind of a hurry,\n\n154\n00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:34.593\nif they're replacing a motherboard,\nreplacing RAM.\n\n155\n00:07:34.593 --> 00:07:37.359\nSo you'll notice if we\nlook right down in here,\n\n156\n00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:42.281\nI've actually removed the RAM altogether,\nwe don't have a memory module in here.\n\n157\n00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.181\nAnd what we're doing here is we're\nsimulating when somebody goes to install\n\n158\n00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:48.530\nRAM and\nthey don't properly seat it, right.\n\n159\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.646\nIt doesn't make an electrical\ncontact with the motherboard.\n\n160\n00:07:50.646 --> 00:07:52.690\nIt's gonna cause some kind of issue.\n\n161\n00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.464\nPerfect.\nLook at that.\n\n162\n00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:54.489\nThank you, there, Dan.\n\n163\n00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:56.001\n&gt;&gt; Coming in with the spotlight.\n\n164\n00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:59.945\n&gt;&gt; So, the interesting thing about this\nis, With the Dell machines here, they\n\n165\n00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:04.130\nkinda have a post before you even hit the\npower button so you're gonna notice that I\n\n166\n00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.095\ndon't even have to reach out here and\nhit the power button like we did before.\n\n167\n00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:09.407\nI'm just going to plug the machine in.\n\n168\n00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:14.494\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; It gets real angry.\n\n169\n00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.776\n&gt;&gt; It does, doesn't it?\n\n170\n00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:18.192\nIt's not too happy at me, Dan, right now.\n\n171\n00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:23.136\nDid you notice that it had some\nspecific timings of that beep, right?\n\n172\n00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:26.896\nThat isn't like a metronome to\nyour favorite blues song here.\n\n173\n00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:29.957\nLet's go ahead and\nwe're gonna unplug that one more time, and\n\n174\n00:08:29.957 --> 00:08:33.887\nI'm gonna dissipate all the electrical\ncurrent out of here by pressing the power\n\n175\n00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:35.182\nbutton and holding it in.\n\n176\n00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:38.177\nAnd notice that little light there, just\nbehind where Dan's shining that light,\n\n177\n00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:39.646\nnotice how it dissipated, it went out.\n\n178\n00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:43.934\nThat lets me know there's not any residual\nelectrical power on the motherboard.\n\n179\n00:08:43.934 --> 00:08:45.326\nAnd we'll do this one more time.\n\n180\n00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:48.972\n[SOUND] Yep.\n\n181\n00:08:48.972 --> 00:08:55.406\n[SOUND] All right, so it's letting me\nknow that there's something wrong.\n\n182\n00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:59.696\nAnd that is, that would be something here\nwhere we wanna actually have to go to\n\n183\n00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:01.214\nDell's website, right?\n\n184\n00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:03.812\nI don't know what those codes are,\n[LAUGH] we kind of joked around and\n\n185\n00:09:03.812 --> 00:09:06.192\nI showed you all the different\npages that we had of codes here.\n\n186\n00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:07.167\nI did that just for\n\n187\n00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:11.472\nthe purposes of showing you guys that\nthere's a lot of them out there, right?\n\n188\n00:09:11.472 --> 00:09:15.193\nSo at this point, and I've had to do this\ntoo, I've done Dell warranty calls and\n\n189\n00:09:15.193 --> 00:09:16.960\nstuff and had to talk to technicians.\n\n190\n00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.036\nAnd they go through a process where\nthey say, well, did you check this,\n\n191\n00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:21.758\ndid you check this, did you check this?\n\n192\n00:09:21.758 --> 00:09:23.774\nAnd then at the end they say, well have\nyou heard any kind of error codes?\n\n193\n00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:24.766\nAnd you say, yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:26.094\nWell, what's the error code?\n\n195\n00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:31.134\nYou try to tell them and they've got\na great customer service base, too.\n\n196\n00:09:31.134 --> 00:09:35.232\nAnd you can even kinda hold the phone over\nand the tech can listen and say, okay.\n\n197\n00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:38.899\nI know what that is let me look through my\nmanual real quick and I'll tell you some\n\n198\n00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:42.814\nof the steps that we can go through before\nwe just, let's say ship you out new parts.\n\n199\n00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:44.480\nSo what do we have to do here?\n\n200\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.622\nWell, what we end up having to do is we\nhave to reinstall the memory correctly.\n\n201\n00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:51.052\nSo let's go ahead and let's do that.\n\n202\n00:09:51.052 --> 00:09:54.590\nLet's take a look at the machine here and\nwhat I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do the same\n\n203\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.894\nthing here, ladies and gentlemen,\nI'm gonna pull the power, all right?\n\n204\n00:09:57.894 --> 00:09:58.886\nIt's important.\n\n205\n00:09:58.886 --> 00:09:59.789\nPress the power button, and\n\n206\n00:09:59.789 --> 00:10:01.638\nthat's what I'm doing here on\nthe front side of the case.\n\n207\n00:10:01.638 --> 00:10:03.542\nSo we'll just hold this power button in.\n\n208\n00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:06.873\nAnd it's really important then the reason\nwe didn't show you the front is all I'm\n\n209\n00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.330\ndoing is holding the power button.\n\n210\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.280\nI just wanted to see that light just\nkind of gently, just fade away.\n\n211\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.338\nAnd again it let's me know that there\nisn't any residual power in here.\n\n212\n00:10:15.338 --> 00:10:19.850\nNow you might be asking yourself, Wes,\nwhere's your ESD wrist strap, right?\n\n213\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.272\nYes, memory, we realize memory is very,\nvery sensitive to electrostatic discharge.\n\n214\n00:10:24.272 --> 00:10:28.840\nBut keep in mind I am dissipating\nany electrical current in my body to\n\n215\n00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.860\nthe case right here just by\ntouching the inside of the case.\n\n216\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.497\nAnd both Dan and I are actually standing\non electrically resistive mats which\n\n217\n00:10:37.497 --> 00:10:40.790\nis a commonality when you\nhave some kind of tech bench.\n\n218\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.979\nSometimes you'll see the mats are actually\non the bench itself and they have a little\n\n219\n00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:49.080\nsnap button that will let you clip on the\nESD wrist strap right to the mat itself.\n\n220\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.648\nI kind of find those\na little bit restrictive.\n\n221\n00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:53.366\n&gt;&gt; And nowadays they make the floor-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n222\n00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:54.440\n&gt;&gt; Out of ESD.\n\n223\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.300\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, in fact our server\nclause that I believe was made out\n\n224\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.220\nof that because we've got thousands\nof dollars of equipment sitting.\n\n225\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.572\n&gt;&gt; Don't wanna mess that up.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n226\n00:11:01.572 --> 00:11:03.012\nThat would be a really\nbad day at the office.\n\n227\n00:11:03.012 --> 00:11:03.844\n&gt;&gt; That'd be a bad day.\n\n228\n00:11:03.844 --> 00:11:06.806\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna dive back into this\n\n229\n00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:09.280\nmachine here and let's go ahead and\ninstall some RAM modules.\n\n230\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.736\nNow I do want you to understand that\nI'm not touching the integral chips,\n\n231\n00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:13.862\nthe little chips here.\n\n232\n00:11:13.862 --> 00:11:14.652\nThanks, Dan.\n\n233\n00:11:14.652 --> 00:11:15.370\nI appreciate that one.\n\n234\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.103\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n235\n00:11:18.103 --> 00:11:19.918\nwe're gonna install this, right?\n\n236\n00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:23.292\nWe're gonna make sure that we\nline it up appropriately so\n\n237\n00:11:23.292 --> 00:11:26.332\nthat we don't get another\none of those beep codes.\n\n238\n00:11:26.332 --> 00:11:29.596\nAnd you should hear these snap.\n\n239\n00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:31.496\nNow, I'll try to be\na little quiet here and,\n\n240\n00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:35.008\n[SOUND] you can hear those click on both\nsides, that's what you wanna hear, right?\n\n241\n00:11:35.008 --> 00:11:37.100\nYou don't want to hear crack,\ncrack, crack, right?\n\n242\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.054\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It means it's in backwards.\n\n243\n00:11:38.054 --> 00:11:41.068\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n244\n00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:43.402\nYou don't put these in, there you go.\n\n245\n00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:45.804\nThere's a second one here, all right.\n\n246\n00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:47.582\nAnd a third one, all right?\n\n247\n00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:53.415\nAnd what we should see,\n[SOUND] again, there's the other one.\n\n248\n00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:57.765\nKeep in mind that you've got dual\nchannel memory or triple channel,\n\n249\n00:11:57.765 --> 00:12:02.491\nor quad channel memory, you wanna make\nsure that you're installing these\n\n250\n00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:06.109\nin the right order,\nthe one-off things that we did say.\n\n251\n00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:07.590\nThere we go, so\nwe got our memory installed.\n\n252\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.395\nOne of the things that we did say, inside\nthe memory module section was that if you\n\n253\n00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:16.920\nare populating every one of the RAM slots,\nthe dm slots on the motherboard,\n\n254\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.660\nthen you don't have to worry\nabout the arrangement, right?\n\n255\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.359\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n256\n00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:24.924\nNow, what I'm gonna do here\nis I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n257\n00:12:24.924 --> 00:12:26.750\nI'm gonna plug this machine back in.\n\n258\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.557\nAnd we shouldn't hear anything.\n\n259\n00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:32.694\nNow, keep in mind That we still have\nto reset the CMOS settings because\n\n260\n00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:38.110\nof the fact that we don't have,\nwe don't have our date and time, right?\n\n261\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.155\nWe're gonna, we'll go ahead and we'll\nkinda show you how that works here too.\n\n262\n00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:43.720\nSo I'm gonna ahead and\nI'm gonna plug this back in.\n\n263\n00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:49.850\nAnd I don't know if you can hear that run,\nright?\n\n264\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.600\nBut we don't seem to have any issues.\n\n265\n00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.510\nNow the other thing I wanna kinda\nshow you too, is while we're in here,\n\n266\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.000\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna unplug this one more time.\n\n267\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.110\nAll right, and again,\nnotice our light here.\n\n268\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.213\nI like these lights that they\nhave on the motherboards today.\n\n269\n00:13:04.213 --> 00:13:07.131\nI'm holding the power in;\npower button that is.\n\n270\n00:13:07.131 --> 00:13:11.436\nAnd again, it does space let me know\nagain that there's no residual electrical\n\n271\n00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:13.955\ncurrent still remaining\non the motherboard.\n\n272\n00:13:13.955 --> 00:13:16.060\nI still wouldn't open a power\nsupply to save my life.\n\n273\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.860\nYou never do that at all.\n\n274\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.160\nI don't care if it's plugged in or not.\n\n275\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.481\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\nit might save your life to not open it.\n\n276\n00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:22.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It might save.\n\n277\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.794\nThank you for getting that\nEnglish correct on that one, Dan.\n\n278\n00:13:24.794 --> 00:13:28.348\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nif we can kind of zoom out a little bit,\n\n279\n00:13:28.348 --> 00:13:30.528\nkind of see the bigger picture here.\n\n280\n00:13:30.528 --> 00:13:32.200\nPerfect, thanks out there.\n\n281\n00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.530\nI'm gonna undo and what I wanna do is\nI wanna take this graphics card out.\n\n282\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:42.390\nSo Im' gonna undo the video cable here and\nwe'll just kind of put this down.\n\n283\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.845\nRemember that I was joking around.\n\n284\n00:13:43.845 --> 00:13:47.090\nI'm gonna take this PCIE\ncard out here real quick.\n\n285\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.133\nRemember I was joking around, I said,\nhey, we're gonna mail Dan a postcard?\n\n286\n00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:52.950\nAnd I said, okay, technically, not really.\n\n287\n00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.526\nWhat we actually have a PCI postcard\ninstalled in this machine, and\n\n288\n00:13:57.526 --> 00:14:02.837\nthese are really good and again, Dell\ndoes something a little bit different.\n\n289\n00:14:02.837 --> 00:14:06.510\nDan, do you mind holding that up,\njust on a diagonal there, bud, real quick?\n\n290\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.747\nIf I plug this in,\nwatch your finger there, I'll plug you in,\n\n291\n00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:13.183\nnotice the lights here and\nwe get the little digital readout here.\n\n292\n00:14:13.183 --> 00:14:15.530\nIt's telling me a zero one there.\n\n293\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.358\nWell, if I push the power\non this machine and\n\n294\n00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:23.558\nit starts to go through its post process,\nthat postcard gives me a visualization\n\n295\n00:14:23.558 --> 00:14:27.780\nof the post process even if I don't\nhave it hooked up to a monitor.\n\n296\n00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.468\nSo if I have the video card\nthat's failing, let's say,\n\n297\n00:14:30.468 --> 00:14:34.164\nor something on the motherboard that's\nfailing, I can see the post process go\n\n298\n00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:37.220\non and I can get a digital read out and\nthen, thank you sir.\n\n299\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.576\nAnd then what we end up doing\nis whatever the card might be,\n\n300\n00:14:40.576 --> 00:14:44.081\nyou just go check out and\nsee what the read out actually says.\n\n301\n00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.168\nBut I can see the lights\nthat are going on here, and\n\n302\n00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:47.880\nthat's one of the things that you have.\n\n303\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.510\nWhen we talk about the postcard.\n\n304\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.921\nNow, you could also have this\nwhere it's hooked up to USB,\n\n305\n00:14:52.921 --> 00:14:56.170\nwhich is really handy cuz then you don't\neven have to take off the case, right?\n\n306\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.660\nYou just have to plug it into\nthe back plane of the motherboard.\n\n307\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.623\nNot the back plane but\nthe back IO devices, right?\n\n308\n00:15:01.623 --> 00:15:04.687\nAnd then what it'll do is\nit'll do the same thing,\n\n309\n00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:07.770\nit'll give you those post numeric codes,\nright?\n\n310\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.982\nOr if it's got an external speaker, right?\n\n311\n00:15:10.982 --> 00:15:14.630\nNow, keep in mind, that every one of\nthese might be a little bit different, so\n\n312\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.090\ndefinitely check with the manufacturer.\n\n313\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.430\nAnd you can hear in\nthe background that beep, beep.\n\n314\n00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.740\nAgain, it's letting me know\na couple of things, right?\n\n315\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.571\nIt's letting me know that either it didn't\nfind a boot device cuz it doesn't even\n\n316\n00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:27.470\nhave an operating system to begin with.\n\n317\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.170\nWell, we still need to set\nthe system time, all right?\n\n318\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.209\nSo what we are gonna go ahead and\ndo, we´re gonna use the magic of\n\n319\n00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:35.970\ntelevision here, and\nwe´re gonna recreate the error and\n\n320\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.660\nwe´re gonna enter into the setup utility\nso that we can show you exactly how.\n\n321\n00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.301\nIf this happened to you and\n\n322\n00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:45.253\nthe BIOS settings were reset\nbecause of a failed CMOS battery,\n\n323\n00:15:45.253 --> 00:15:50.890\nwhat it would look like to bring those\nback online and then reset that time.\n\n324\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.321\nAll right, Dan.\nIt does look like we got our memory back\n\n325\n00:15:53.321 --> 00:15:54.220\nin place here.\n\n326\n00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.565\nWe've got our CMOS battery set back in.\n\n327\n00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:58.778\nWe've got our graphics card ready to go.\n\n328\n00:15:58.778 --> 00:16:02.599\nWe're gonna go ahead and plug this in and\nCouple of things could happen,\n\n329\n00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:05.871\nsometimes the power comes right on,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n330\n00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:07.640\nWe'll we kinda see which\none this ones gonna do.\n\n331\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.562\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll press power on this machine here.\n\n332\n00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:11.700\n[CROSSTALK] And.\n&gt;&gt; We see some lights.\n\n333\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we see some lights on that and\nI'm glad that postcard.\n\n334\n00:16:14.228 --> 00:16:16.010\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's helpful\n\n335\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.815\n&gt;&gt; And depending on how your BIOS is,\n\n336\n00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:21.691\nagain, sometimes you'll see that if\nthere's a corruption in the BIOS.\n\n337\n00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:23.504\nI know some gaming boards that I have,\n\n338\n00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:26.177\none of the boards that I have\nat the house has a dual BIOS.\n\n339\n00:16:26.177 --> 00:16:30.440\nAnd what'll happen is, it might take a\nlittle bit for the BIOS screen to come on.\n\n340\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.899\nAnd what's happening is it fails\nover to basically a protected BIOS.\n\n341\n00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:38.569\nAnd then they kinda override each\nother and it'll rebuild the first one.\n\n342\n00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:41.550\nSometimes you can see here, it takes\na little bit for these to come on.\n\n343\n00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.166\nSometimes they end up booting right up.\n\n344\n00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:48.678\nMight be one of these things where hey,\nit doesn't because we have removed\n\n345\n00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:51.423\nthe CMOS battery,\nthat they might not come on right away.\n\n346\n00:16:51.423 --> 00:16:55.652\nYou can see right now, again it's going\nthrough that automatic IDE configuration,\n\n347\n00:16:55.652 --> 00:16:57.835\nand you gotta keep in\nmind what's going on.\n\n348\n00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:03.562\nIf the BIOS had retained those settings,\nit looks directly to the CMOS,\n\n349\n00:17:03.562 --> 00:17:06.397\nright, and\nit just loads up those settings.\n\n350\n00:17:06.397 --> 00:17:11.172\nSince those settings has been erased it\ntakes a little bit longer because it's\n\n351\n00:17:11.172 --> 00:17:13.429\ngonna pull the BIOS configuration.\n\n352\n00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:17.740\nAnd it's loaded with the EE prompt\nshift and basically loaded on the Bran.\n\n353\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.984\nSo it takes a little bit longer and you\ncan see that it's going through something\n\n354\n00:17:21.984 --> 00:17:24.468\nlike a diagnostic slash\nconfiguration here.\n\n355\n00:17:24.468 --> 00:17:27.038\nSo we'll give it a second here.\n\n356\n00:17:27.038 --> 00:17:30.735\nAnd it might be even one of\nthose things that you can even,\n\n357\n00:17:30.735 --> 00:17:35.451\nsometimes what you can do is you can\nactually kind of reboot the machine.\n\n358\n00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:39.735\nSo if it doesn't end up working, you can\nalways to the Ctrl+Alt+Delete, [CROSSTALK]\n\n359\n00:17:39.735 --> 00:17:40.503\n&gt;&gt; The three finger board.\n\n360\n00:17:40.503 --> 00:17:42.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right absolutely.\n\n361\n00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:45.077\nAnd I don't know if that actually,\ndid it on this one?\n\n362\n00:17:45.077 --> 00:17:46.742\nYeah, okay, there we go.\n\n363\n00:17:46.742 --> 00:17:48.320\nAnd we'll kinda show you what's going on.\n\n364\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.629\nNow I do wanna show you too,\nremember we seen an invalid configuration.\n\n365\n00:17:53.629 --> 00:17:57.812\nNotice that when the machine\nrebooted it didn't do that automatic\n\n366\n00:17:57.812 --> 00:18:00.357\nconfiguration this time, why is that?\n\n367\n00:18:00.357 --> 00:18:04.260\nAll right, well,\nwhen you reboot a machine like this.\n\n368\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.354\nOkay, so we are getting\nthe system hardware reset but\n\n369\n00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:09.569\nwe're not getting the time, right.\n\n370\n00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:11.200\nWhy is that?\n\n371\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.391\nWell, because it didn't have a time\nconfiguration on the first boot and\n\n372\n00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:17.530\nit gives you invalid time settings.\n\n373\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.690\nBut then what it does when I\njust rebooted the machine,\n\n374\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.302\nit says okay we've got a time, we've got\na time that still remains in the BIOS.\n\n375\n00:18:25.302 --> 00:18:26.570\nWe'll go ahead and we'll put that.\n\n376\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.401\nAnd we'll set that as the system time,\nand it kinda fixes itself.\n\n377\n00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.569\nNow, technically it doesn't fix itself,\nright.\n\n378\n00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.997\nWe still need to go in and\nconfigure it, but\n\n379\n00:18:33.997 --> 00:18:37.037\nat least allows you to perform\nthe full boot process.\n\n380\n00:18:37.037 --> 00:18:41.361\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's get into our setup utility here.\n\n381\n00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:45.529\nAll right, we're just gonna press F2,\njust like it says, run the setup utility.\n\n382\n00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:49.726\nAnd what we should see here in a second is\nthat it boots right into the standard BIOS\n\n383\n00:18:49.726 --> 00:18:50.847\nscreen, all right?\n\n384\n00:18:50.847 --> 00:18:53.646\nSo if we can bring that\nscreen back up here and\n\n385\n00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:56.226\nwe'll see hopefully it'll get there.\n\n386\n00:18:56.226 --> 00:18:58.501\nSometimes it takes a second here.\n\n387\n00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:02.570\nWhen it gets in there we could run,\nagain on-board diagnostics here.\n\n388\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.189\nBut we'll see what's going on here,\nand give it just a little bit more.\n\n389\n00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:08.781\nSometimes you can get\nright into the settings.\n\n390\n00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:09.760\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n391\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.827\nIt looks like my keyboard\ndoesn't like me right now.\n\n392\n00:19:12.827 --> 00:19:16.220\nSo I can go ahead, and\nI can essentially hit F12 and\n\n393\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.472\nget into the one-time boot menu.\n\n394\n00:19:18.472 --> 00:19:22.450\nOne of the things I like about these Dells\nis you'll see in the one-time boot menu.\n\n395\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.679\nIt also allows you to get into\nthe configuration utility as well.\n\n396\n00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:30.247\nI'm not really worried right now\nabout getting in to the ray to ray\n\n397\n00:19:30.247 --> 00:19:35.659\nconfiguration because well we've already\ngot a good ray to ray configured.\n\n398\n00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:37.809\nNow notice that we have the system set up.\n\n399\n00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.400\nI'm just gonna scroll down\nwith the keyboard here.\n\n400\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.008\nAnd we'll hit the system setup and\nwe're gonna let that load up.\n\n401\n00:19:43.008 --> 00:19:46.806\nNow again, this is one of those things\nwhere it isn't loading it from a hard\n\n402\n00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:49.052\ndrive, so\nit could take a bit to get in here.\n\n403\n00:19:49.052 --> 00:19:52.529\nThe first thing I want to look at is\nyou'll notice if we scroll down is\n\n404\n00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:53.507\nthe date and time.\n\n405\n00:19:53.507 --> 00:19:56.802\nNow notice this date and time, right,\nwe're recording this, what is it,\n\n406\n00:19:56.802 --> 00:19:57.993\nJuly 6th I think you said.\n\n407\n00:19:57.993 --> 00:19:58.606\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Sixth, yes.\n\n408\n00:19:58.606 --> 00:20:01.570\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, July 6th of 2017.\n\n409\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.492\nHowever you see the time we have up here,\nthe date right, it says 9, and\n\n410\n00:20:06.492 --> 00:20:08.122\nthen it says 2010.\n\n411\n00:20:08.122 --> 00:20:11.132\nWell that's because it's\nhard coded in the BIOS.\n\n412\n00:20:11.132 --> 00:20:15.421\nSo I have to come in here, and\nI have to change again that date and time.\n\n413\n00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:19.089\nNow at that date and time doesn't\nstay when I reboot the computer,\n\n414\n00:20:19.089 --> 00:20:22.680\nthen that lets me know that\nthe CMOS battery has failed, right.\n\n415\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.829\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll set that.\n\n416\n00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:27.840\nAnd we'll set that to 2017.\n\n417\n00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.765\nAnd I am going to kinda\nrubberneck Dan's phone.\n\n418\n00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:33.553\nIt looks like we got 10:46.\n\n419\n00:20:33.553 --> 00:20:39.730\nWe'll go ahead and\nset the time to 10:46 am.\n\n420\n00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.339\nThen from here I can't\nremember if it's F10.\n\n421\n00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:44.662\nMy head's kinda covering this one up here.\n\n422\n00:20:44.662 --> 00:20:50.220\nAnd what you can do is you can chose\nexit and it will save my configurations.\n\n423\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.029\nNow when it does reboot, please\nunderstand that it isn't gonna go into\n\n424\n00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:57.714\nan operating system cuz we don't\nhave an operating system, right.\n\n425\n00:20:57.714 --> 00:21:02.440\nThis is the same machine we used when we\nwere showing RAID controllers failing.\n\n426\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.977\nNotice that one of the things we don't\nreally see that is happening again is that\n\n427\n00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:12.328\nit shouldn't be giving us\nthat invalid date and time.\n\n428\n00:21:12.328 --> 00:21:16.040\nHowever we would still need to\nshow an operating system, right.\n\n429\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.900\nSo system hardware requires a reset,\nand again, that's because of the fact\n\n430\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.109\nthat we didn't do each one of\nthe configurations for what we need.\n\n431\n00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:28.640\nSo we should be good as far\nas the date and time goes.\n\n432\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.390\nBut again, we would have to do\nsome additional configurations,\n\n433\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.847\nincluding installing an operating system\nto make this system fully functional.\n\n434\n00:21:34.847 --> 00:21:37.061\nAll right, so that some of the things\nthat you can hear with those\n\n435\n00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:37.800\naudible beep codes.\n\n436\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.680\nAnd there some of the things\nwe wanted you to know, right.\n\n437\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.772\nLast thing that we want to\nkind of talk about are some of\n\n438\n00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:46.190\nthe power issues that you might run into.\n\n439\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.714\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n440\n00:21:47.714 --> 00:21:51.213\ndo is we're going to set up showing\nyou how you can potentially diagnose,\n\n441\n00:21:51.213 --> 00:21:54.960\nif you have things like issues with,\nfor instance the power supply.\n\n442\n00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.457\nSo that´s the next thing\nwe´re going to look at.\n\n443\n00:21:56.457 --> 00:21:58.804\nToday, yeah,\nwe were talking about power issues and\n\n444\n00:21:58.804 --> 00:22:01.264\nsome times things don´t\nreally manifest themselves.\n\n445\n00:22:01.264 --> 00:22:05.137\nIf you know that it´s a power issue,\nI can give you one example of where it is.\n\n446\n00:22:05.137 --> 00:22:08.766\nSo for instance, let´s say that\nyour CPU isn't receiving power,\n\n447\n00:22:08.766 --> 00:22:12.470\nwhether it happens to be a rail coming\noff of the power supply itself.\n\n448\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:18.665\nOr it could actually be the connector,\nwhether it's the 8 pin EPS connector,\n\n449\n00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:24.040\nor whether it's like the old P4 ATX\nconnector, if that's failed.\n\n450\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.038\nSo what I went ahead and\ndid is I went ahead and pulled,\n\n451\n00:22:27.038 --> 00:22:30.050\nif you will,\nthe P4 connector off of the board here.\n\n452\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.942\nAnd it would be no different than if this\nfailed off of the back of the power supply\n\n453\n00:22:33.942 --> 00:22:37.646\nor if that port itself you know the\nconnector on the motherboard had fried.\n\n454\n00:22:37.646 --> 00:22:39.163\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're just simulating that failure?\n\n455\n00:22:39.163 --> 00:22:40.642\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that absolutely, yeah yeah.\n\n456\n00:22:40.642 --> 00:22:43.763\nSo if we plug this in, this is\nan interesting one because remember one of\n\n457\n00:22:43.763 --> 00:22:46.728\nthe things that the objectives have\ncalled that we've called out is\n\n458\n00:22:46.728 --> 00:22:49.240\nthe fact that the fans spin and\nnothing happens, right.\n\n459\n00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.507\nSo let me show you here.\n\n460\n00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:53.119\nNotice that the fans are spinning.\n\n461\n00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:58.350\nBoth the system fan and the CPU fan, and\nwow, they just instantly turn right off.\n\n462\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.970\nSo what it did is it noticed that hey,\nI notice that I have power to\n\n463\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.936\nthe three pin and four pin molex KK\nconnectors on the motherboard that\n\n464\n00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:12.408\ncontrol the power to the fans but\nI've got nothing on the CPU.\n\n465\n00:23:12.408 --> 00:23:16.227\nSo to protect itself,\nthe mother board said no food for you, and\n\n466\n00:23:16.227 --> 00:23:18.150\nit shut itself down right away.\n\n467\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.427\nSo that's actually a good protection\nmechanism letting you know that if\n\n468\n00:23:22.427 --> 00:23:24.402\nthe power supply goes like this.\n\n469\n00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:26.502\nAnd it isn't giving you any power at all,\n\n470\n00:23:26.502 --> 00:23:28.970\nyou don't have to worry\nabout damage to the CPU.\n\n471\n00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.627\nNow that's not necessarily the case\nif the power itself is lost or\n\n472\n00:23:32.627 --> 00:23:36.030\nif something's wrong with that\nlittle four pin connector.\n\n473\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.537\nSo, what would we do, right.\n\n474\n00:23:38.537 --> 00:23:40.268\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n475\n00:23:40.268 --> 00:23:44.575\ndo is we're going to kind of show you how\nyou could test the power supply itself.\n\n476\n00:23:44.575 --> 00:23:46.297\nSo that'll be the next thing\nwe're going to look at.\n\n477\n00:23:46.297 --> 00:23:48.107\nSo Dan, I guess if we're\ngoing to talk about power,\n\n478\n00:23:48.107 --> 00:23:50.512\nthe first thing we have to do is\na little disclaimer warning, right.\n\n479\n00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:54.352\nSo be very, very careful when you\nare testing any kind of power supply,\n\n480\n00:23:54.352 --> 00:23:58.512\nlike we said throughout the last few\nparts here that we've been in hardware,\n\n481\n00:23:58.512 --> 00:23:59.993\nnever open a power supply.\n\n482\n00:23:59.993 --> 00:24:03.792\nKeep in mind that it does have capacitors\nin it that can retain their charge\n\n483\n00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:07.732\njust like the old CRT monitors that,\njust on contact could stop your heart.\n\n484\n00:24:07.732 --> 00:24:10.601\nIt isn't something you\nwant to take very lightly.\n\n485\n00:24:10.601 --> 00:24:15.530\nIf you feel uncomfortable dealing with\nany kind of electrical power then by all\n\n486\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.963\nmeans leave it the people,\nelectrical engineers, or\n\n487\n00:24:18.963 --> 00:24:22.190\npeople that do have\nthe qualifications to test it.\n\n488\n00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.460\nNow that being said there are some basic\ntests that you can run on your power\n\n489\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.590\nsupplies if you do feel like maybe the\nfans are spinning like we've shown you and\n\n490\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.330\nwe're not getting power to the machine\nyou can pull out your multimeter.\n\n491\n00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.500\nWe've got a power supply already set up.\n\n492\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500\nSo here's a power supply\nhere that we have.\n\n493\n00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.470\nAgain this is about 1,100 watt power\nsupply here and what we're gonna do is\n\n494\n00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.640\nwe'll go ahead and we'll turn it\non here and let it start up again.\n\n495\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.600\nYou can see if something like this\nhappened where the fan is actually\n\n496\n00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.780\nspinning and you have no power,\nthen that's pretty,\n\n497\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.270\na good tell tale sign that something\nhas failed on the power supply.\n\n498\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.890\nNow what we have here are the P4\nConnectors that I was talking about.\n\n499\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.080\nOne of the ways that you can test these,\nkeep in mind our multimeter.\n\n500\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.840\nSo if we look at our multimeter here.\n\n501\n00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.370\nNotice that what you want to do,\n\n502\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.290\nis you want to kind of keep it to the\nsetting there on the multimeter that is\n\n503\n00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.200\nclosest to one of the voltage\nof which you're testing.\n\n504\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.660\nIf we can zoom into the multimeter there,\n\n505\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.330\nwe will see here that we\ngot it set on the 20 volts.\n\n506\n00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.360\nAnd that's as close to what\nwe are going to be testing,\n\n507\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.320\nbecause what we're gonna be testing\nis the 12 volt circuit, if you will.\n\n508\n00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.260\nSo I'm going to go ahead, and\nwhat I'll do is I'll touch this negative\n\n509\n00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.670\nprobe here to the negative side, and\n\n510\n00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:38.440\nthen what we will do is we'll touch\nthis to the hot wire if you will and\n\n511\n00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.560\nyou'll notice the voltmeter is letting\nus know that it is in the 12 volt range.\n\n512\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.990\nYou can see right here that\nit's within its tolerance.\n\n513\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.400\nKeep in mind that it may not be exact.\n\n514\n00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.880\nAnd if it was just a little bit under\nyou know that might cause a problem but\n\n515\n00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.930\nif you're a little bit over remember\nthe device can only pull the amount of\n\n516\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.000\npower that it's you know\ncapable of pulling.\n\n517\n00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.950\nNow we could go a little further in than\nthis and then what I could do is I could\n\n518\n00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.210\npull over like one of these\nMolex connectors here and\n\n519\n00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.200\nwe can show you you know again\none of the other voltages and\n\n520\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.280\nthis ones kind of a little\neasier to test out.\n\n521\n00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.570\nBecause you can take your negative,\nyour black is your ground here and\n\n522\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.640\nwe could test again\nthe same thing just putting\n\n523\n00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.340\nthe black probe here into the ground and\nthen we can test for\n\n524\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.820\ninstance the yellow wire here, and\nyou´ll notice that same thing.\n\n525\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.750\nWe get our 12 volts.\n\n526\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.070\nSo you can see that from\ntwo different rails here,\n\n527\n00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.280\nwe´re getting 12 volts off of each rail.\n\n528\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.510\nI´m going to move this over a little\nbit so we don´t arch out here.\n\n529\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.040\nAnd we can test, again, the red.\n\n530\n00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.840\nThe red is the five volt,\nor should be five volts.\n\n531\n00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.180\nAnd you can see here too,\nwe're right in the way,\n\n532\n00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:51.040\nin a good tolerance so I can tell\nthat this power supply is giving off\n\n533\n00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.550\nthe appropriate voltages that it needs to\nbe and I'll go ahead and turn this off.\n\n534\n00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.250\nBut that's something that you can see,\n\n535\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.670\nagain keep in mind that when it\ncomes to testing the power supply.\n\n536\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.150\nIf Dan or I were, if we were sitting\nhere and we were working on one of these\n\n537\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.340\nmachines, we could say, you know what,\nwe know that the power supply is good.\n\n538\n00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.480\nWe put the multimeter on it.\n\n539\n00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.870\nIt seems to check out, so\nthen what would the other thing be?\n\n540\n00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.710\nWell it could be\nthe motherboard that's failing.\n\n541\n00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.410\nRight?\nIf you're not getting any\n\n542\n00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.510\ncomputation out of the CPU.\n\n543\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.140\nCould be the fact that the CPU´s failed.\n\n544\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.260\nRemember to use your tools that you have.\n\n545\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.890\nWe´ve kind of shown you in the background\nsome of the tools that we´ve had up here\n\n546\n00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.470\non the desk since we´ve started.\n\n547\n00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.820\nYou know, your chip inserters,\nyou have things like your thermal paste.\n\n548\n00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.060\nRemember, that´s the other thing\nthey did mention overheating.\n\n549\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.380\nIf you forget to put thermal paste.\n\n550\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.890\nAnd it can happen if\npeople get in a hurry.\n\n551\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.480\nThey don't put the thermal paste on,\ndon't spread it out right.\n\n552\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.110\nRemember, what that does is that leaves\na metal on metal contact with the CPU.\n\n553\n00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.400\nActually, it leaves\na really small air gap, and\n\n554\n00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.360\nthat air gap turns into an insulator,\nright.\n\n555\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.860\nAs it heats up it just stays right there,\nand\n\n556\n00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.070\nit actually can completely melt the CPU.\n\n557\n00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.280\nSo you wanna make sure for instance,\nwhen you're using a thermal compound and\n\n558\n00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.110\nyou replacing a CPU or\n\n559\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.600\nmaybe installing a heat sink to make sure\nyou have that thermal compound on there.\n\n560\n00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.180\nSo, those are a few of the things,\n\n561\n00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.290\nlike we say anytime you're dealing\nwith any product that could have\n\n562\n00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:19.150\npotential for damage due to static\ndischarge, electrostatic discharge.\n\n563\n00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.080\nRemember wear your wrist straps or\n\n564\n00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.800\ndo what we're doing stand on\nelectrically resistive maps and\n\n565\n00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.550\nground out to the case to make sure\nthat you're dissipating that energy,\n\n566\n00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.110\nthat electricity somewhere else other than\nthe components that you're working on.\n\n567\n00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.680\nJust again I cannot stress enough.\n\n568\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.390\nAnd it comes to this electrical\nequipment make sure you're dissipating\n\n569\n00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.580\nall the excess electricity or\n\n570\n00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.660\ndischarging any excess electricity\nwhen you pull the power on it.\n\n571\n00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.870\nWhen you're replacing parts,\npush the power button and\n\n572\n00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.880\nlet it, you hold it in for\na little bit, right?\n\n573\n00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.820\nAnd that will make sure that any residual\nelectrical current that is left inside\n\n574\n00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.385\nof the system is dissipated.\n\n575\n00:28:52.385 --> 00:28:55.656\nAnd be very careful if you\ndon't feel comfortable doing,\n\n576\n00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:59.410\nwhat it is that they're asking\nyou to do well, then escalate it.\n\n577\n00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.670\nThat's the reason you have\nescalating processes,\n\n578\n00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.020\nescalation processes within\nthe company that you're working for.\n\n579\n00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.030\nMaybe you're tier one,\nyou wanna deal with the software,\n\n580\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.440\nyou don't wanna deal with the hardware,\nor vice versa.\n\n581\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.190\nOnly do that work that\nyou're qualified for.\n\n582\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.980\nAnd remember some of the things that\nwe've shown you in this episode or\n\n583\n00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.280\nthis mini series we've been doing, so\n\n584\n00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.780\nthat if they ask you on the A+ exam,\nyou'll be able to pass it.\n\n585\n00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.650\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, thank you so much for\nthose cool troubleshooting demonstrations,\n\n586\n00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.740\nvery good for us to not only\nunderstand the theory behind it but\n\n587\n00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.440\nto see it in practical application.\n\n588\n00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.560\nSo hopefully that helped\nyou guys out there as well.\n\n589\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.150\nWe work really hard to bring that kind\nof content to you people but guess what?\n\n590\n00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.730\nI'm looking at the clock and\nwe've run out of time for this episode.\n\n591\n00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.260\nWe do thank you so much for\nwatching though signing off for\n\n592\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.340\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:08.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.174\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:14.133\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.710\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.710\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.060\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with more in our A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.466\nThat's right, the good old 22901.\n\n10\n00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.946\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nthings about to get a little crazy and\n\n11\n00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:29.680\nwe're gonna have a lot of fun\ntoday with Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.472\nWes, how is it going today man?\n\n13\n00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:31.819\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great man.\n\n14\n00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:35.092\nThat's right, we're gonna try not\nto electrocute Wes on this show.\n\n15\n00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:36.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you might stay tuned.\n\n16\n00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:37.306\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:40.515\nStick around,\nbecause it might happen, yes.\n\n18\n00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.120\n[LAUGH] That's right, we're gonna be\nlooking at, well some troubleshooting.\n\n19\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.460\nAs we move out our hardware, we've talked\nabout, kind of shown you guys and gals out\n\n20\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.090\nthere, some of the different types of\nhardware that we have within our systems.\n\n21\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.610\nWe talked about all kinds of things,\nright?\n\n22\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.350\nWe talked about memory.\n\n23\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.570\nWe talked about RAM.\n\n24\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.540\nWe talked about different storage devices.\n\n25\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.850\nWe talked about power in general.\n\n26\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.990\nWe talked about things\nlike networking as well.\n\n27\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.950\nDifferent kinds of networking,\ncommunications, and protocols.\n\n28\n00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.630\nWell, in this episode this is where we\nstart to move into the troubleshooting\n\n29\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.320\nside, because we have our hardware.\n\n30\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.970\nIt's important to understand what\nthe hardware is, what it does,\n\n31\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.630\nhow it functions.\n\n32\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.860\nBut it's also important to understand,\n\n33\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850\nespecially when it comes to support on\nsome of the things that could go wrong.\n\n34\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.430\nAnd then not only things\nthat could go wrong, but\n\n35\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.450\nsome of the symptoms of\na problem that might occur.\n\n36\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.370\nAnd then as well,\nwell what are some of the remedies, right?\n\n37\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.540\nWhat are some of the things that we can\ndo in order to diagnose a problem, right?\n\n38\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.490\nSo you gotta recognize, first of all,\nthere is a problem, right?\n\n39\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.510\nYou need to diagnose that problem,\nwhat is the actual cause of it?\n\n40\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.520\nAnd kind of like you might\nhave heard out there,\n\n41\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.480\nwe don't wanna just treat the symptoms,\nright?\n\n42\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.540\nWe wanna find out what the cause is.\n\n43\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.300\nThe symptoms tell us\nthat there is a problem.\n\n44\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.040\nWe can find out what the root cause is.\n\n45\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.400\nAnd then some of the things that we\ncan do to maybe repair the problem.\n\n46\n00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.120\nSometimes it's just a piece\nof software that we can run.\n\n47\n00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.890\nAnd it might proverbially\nget the bugs out.\n\n48\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.340\nAnd we're not talking malware,\nbut who knows, maybe we are.\n\n49\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.670\nAs well as sometimes, there's just things\nthat you, when it comes to hardware\n\n50\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.700\nfailure, component failure,\nthat you just can't recover from, right?\n\n51\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.948\nAnd it might be time and in that case\nto throw the old towel in the ring and\n\n52\n00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:21.350\nsay okay,\nwe're gonna have to get another component.\n\n53\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.020\nBut that's some of the things that\nwe're gonna look at in this episode.\n\n54\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.330\nAnd specifically we're gonna be looking\nat hard drives, right, mechanical drives.\n\n55\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.740\nWe're gonna be looking at RAID arrays,\nremember in another episode we kinda\n\n56\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.620\ndove in to the redundant ray\nof independent disks, right?\n\n57\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.470\nWe talk about a way to aggregate,\nif you will or combine multiple drives for\n\n58\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.400\na couple different reasons.\n\n59\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.780\nEither performance, if you will.\n\n60\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.810\nWe wanna speed up things, or\nmaybe we want some fault tolerance, right?\n\n61\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.130\nIf one drive happens to fail,\n\n62\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.670\nwe wanna be able to have access to\nour data, or at least have our data.\n\n63\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.930\nSo we might not have access to it\ndepending on what kind of configurations\n\n64\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.240\nwe have, or\nmaybe it's the best of both worlds right?\n\n65\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.320\nMaybe we implement some\nkind of performance gain\n\n66\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.120\nif you will as well as a certain\nlevel of fault tolerance.\n\n67\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.140\nSo that is some of the things that we\nare gonna look at in this episode.\n\n68\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.770\nAnd like everything in A+ so far,\nit's gonna be a laundry list of things.\n\n69\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.470\nBut like Dan said, I agree completely.\n\n70\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170\nThis is gonna be one that\nis a little bit more fun.\n\n71\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.943\nAll right, so where are we gonna\nstart out right away, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:18.972\nWell we're gonna start out with\na couple of the things that they say.\n\n73\n00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:23.250\nAnd here's the formal objectives,\nif you want to know where we are in\n\n74\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.140\nthe objective list if you're\nout there following at home.\n\n75\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.410\nGiven a scenario,\ntroubleshoot hard drives and\n\n76\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.590\nRAID arrays with the appropriate tools.\n\n77\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.492\nWell before we get into the tools,\n\n78\n00:03:32.492 --> 00:03:35.450\nwhat are some of the things\nthat can go wrong, right?\n\n79\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.682\nOne of the very first things they\ncall out, is what is known as read,\n\n80\n00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:39.490\nwrite failure.\n\n81\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.947\nNow when we talk about read,\nwrite failure,\n\n82\n00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:46.150\nunderstand that the ability to write to\na hard drive, the ability to read from\n\n83\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.850\na hard drive is largely centered\naround a couple of things, right?\n\n84\n00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.300\nFirst of all is power to the device.\n\n85\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.200\nThat's gonna be something\nthat is important.\n\n86\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.140\nThe other thing is we have a data cable,\nright?\n\n87\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.800\nData cable that connects from the\nmotherboard to the storage device itself,\n\n88\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.800\nand it allows us to actually pipe\ninformation into the storage device or\n\n89\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.000\nto read that information\nout of the device.\n\n90\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.840\nSo we're gonna start there, right?\n\n91\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.430\nBasic connections, and when we talk\nabout connections, let's go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.434\nif we can take a look.\n\n93\n00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:17.992\nWe got a couple of drives here, and if we\ncould look at these drives you’ll see that\n\n94\n00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:20.580\nwe have a couple of different things,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.890\nWe have on the back of them, right,\nwe have a 15 pin power cable, right,\n\n96\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.330\nthe power is right here you can see that\nblade connector that we talked about.\n\n97\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.860\nWe gotta make sure, first of all,\nthat we have power to the device.\n\n98\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.800\nThat is gonna be very important to be able\nto read or to write from our hard drive.\n\n99\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.805\nIf it isn't connected, well,\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n100\n00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:40.709\nRemember, we also have the data cable, and\nwe're really just looking at things like,\n\n101\n00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:44.740\nfor instance in this mechanical drive,\nit could be a solid-state drive, right?\n\n102\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.260\nAnd one of the telltale symptoms of a\nsolid state drive, because it's electrical\n\n103\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.070\nis that there's some kind of smell to it,\ncuz it burns if you will.\n\n104\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.890\nBut again, we're not even\ngetting into that depth, right?\n\n105\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.530\nIt could start out with basic connections,\nright?\n\n106\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.572\nIf I have a loose cable, doesn't matter\nif it's the power cable on here,\n\n107\n00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:04.850\nthe 15-pin power cable or\nif it's the 7 pin data cable.\n\n108\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.845\nIf it isn't connected properly to\nthe back of the drive itself and\n\n109\n00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:11.940\nto the motherboard, either one of these,\nright, we're gonna have problems, right?\n\n110\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.860\nAnd then I guess your power\nsupply is gonna more connected\n\n111\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.720\nobviously to the PSU unit or power supply\nunit as well as the back of the device.\n\n112\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.930\nSo we start right there.\n\n113\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.650\nThose are some of the very early,\n\n114\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.130\nbasic things that we gotta keep in mind,\nthe connections.\n\n115\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.330\nOne of the things that I want you to\ndo when you approach the A+ exam,\n\n116\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.910\nis don't overlook the simple fixes first.\n\n117\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.880\nDan, have you ever done that?\n\n118\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.110\nAnd I know I'm guilty of\nthis on many occasions.\n\n119\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.510\nMaking it way too complex saying,\n\n120\n00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.520\nit's gotta be the fact that\nthe platters aren't spinning.\n\n121\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.613\nAnd I looked down and I've actually,\ncause of my long legs and my\n\n122\n00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:49.469\nRonald McDonald sized feet I've actually\nturned the power strip off, right?\n\n123\n00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.400\nAnd now I have no power to anything,\nright?\n\n124\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my favorite is,\nwe are being hacked, right?\n\n125\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.170\nObviously a hack is occurring right now,\ncuz we can't access our data.\n\n126\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.120\nSomething's going wrong, you're like,\nlet's start simpler than that.\n\n127\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.270\nMaybe it's not the government or\nhacktivist group that's coming after us.\n\n128\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.401\nMaybe it's just the fact that\nsomething has powered off.\n\n129\n00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:10.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely.\n\n130\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.180\nAnother thing that happens, especially if\nyou're working in a help desk situation,\n\n131\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.390\nor you're working at the tech bench,\nright?\n\n132\n00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.260\nWhat happens, right?\n\n133\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.930\nYou say, okay.\n\n134\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.250\nYou know the customer's gonna be back,\n\n135\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.430\nlet's say theoretically\nat 2 o'clock right?\n\n136\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.712\nI still have this entire computer apart,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:28.080\nAnd like a pit crew, I've gotta put this\nthing back together because time's ticking\n\n138\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.210\naway and that customer's gonna be\nhere saying, hey where's my stuff?\n\n139\n00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.100\nI told you I'd be here, and what happens?\n\n140\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.780\nYou get in a hurry.\n\n141\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.730\nYou start plugging things in,\nand little do you know that you\n\n142\n00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.460\nthought you plug the cable if you will\ninto the motherboard when you did, right?\n\n143\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.696\nI tell you what, we've got a great\nadmonishment, if you will,\n\n144\n00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:48.510\nin our chat room out there.\n\n145\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.536\nOne of our viewers out there says,\nnever assume anything and\n\n146\n00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.090\nabsolutely correct, right?\n\n147\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.530\nBecause the military tells you,\nwhat happens to assumption?\n\n148\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.160\nAssumption sinks ships, right?\n\n149\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.260\nNever assume anything,\nalways check it out.\n\n150\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.920\nAnd start with simple fixes,\nstart with visual inspections.\n\n151\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.740\nVisual inspection, maybe open the case,\n\n152\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.550\nmaybe you look at those connections,\nright?\n\n153\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.730\nI look at the cable,\nis the cable plugged into the back of\n\n154\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.930\nthe power supply on the outside\nof the system chassis, right?\n\n155\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.510\nHow about the AC outlet?\n\n156\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.670\nAre you plugged in to the AC outlet?\n\n157\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.505\nThat could be.\n\n158\n00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:22.620\nOne of the things I like is doing\na voltage check, if you will.\n\n159\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.600\nIs there a presence of\nvoltage in the wall?\n\n160\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.280\nYou say, well wait a second, do I really\nhave to go out and get one of those volt\n\n161\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.410\nmeters, voltameters I think they call\nthem, or even just finding out there's AC.\n\n162\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.433\nYou certainly don't stick a fork\nin it to figure out, right?\n\n163\n00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:39.112\n[LAUGH] That's a great test but it's not-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, it will be effective.\n\n164\n00:07:39.112 --> 00:07:42.344\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna help you for\nyour health wise, right?\n\n165\n00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:43.490\n&gt;&gt; You can do that once.\n\n166\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.408\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n167\n00:07:44.408 --> 00:07:45.015\n&gt;&gt; That test works once.\n\n168\n00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:47.385\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is the disclaimer,\n\n169\n00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:48.683\ndon't try that at home, right?\n\n170\n00:07:48.683 --> 00:07:52.511\nSo one of the easy things that you could\ndo, and I love this, I actually learned\n\n171\n00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:55.701\nthis from our other hosts here that said,\nI don't wanna go out and\n\n172\n00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.781\nI don't wanna buy something that lets me\nknow if there's voltage in the AC outlet.\n\n173\n00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:02.212\nI plug into another AC outlet,\nand I turn a light on.\n\n174\n00:08:02.212 --> 00:08:04.750\nI turn a little desk lamp and\nI turn it on.\n\n175\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.990\nAnd I unplug it from the wall.\n\n176\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.280\nAnd then I take it over to\nthe AC outlet and I plug it in.\n\n177\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.060\nIf the light comes on, well, guess what?\n\n178\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.390\nYou've got electrical current\ngo running the outlet.\n\n179\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.310\nVery very simplistic way.\n\n180\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.250\nAnd I mention simplicity,\nagain, not only for\n\n181\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.780\nthe obvious reasons that it can happen.\n\n182\n00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.710\nBut, I also want you to approach\nthe exam that way right.\n\n183\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.420\nDon't over think a question.\n\n184\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.890\nDon't rewrite the question.\n\n185\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.490\nRead what it says.\n\n186\n00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.810\nUnderstand the key words.\n\n187\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.600\nUnderstand the context of the question.\n\n188\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.800\nAnd, always start with simple fixes first.\n\n189\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.220\nAll right, now that being said, some\nthings might not be so simplistic, right.\n\n190\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.180\nSome things might manifest themselves in\nways that we have a rewrite failure and\n\n191\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.220\nit has nothing to do with the power right.\n\n192\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.400\nIt could be the fact that you have\nsomething like maybe a head crash, right.\n\n193\n00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.290\nRemember we talked about\nthe mechanical drives,\n\n194\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.260\nwe have essentially it's an actuated\narm with the motor on it right.\n\n195\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.500\nA lot of moving parts it's why\nthey call it a mechanical drive.\n\n196\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.630\nAnd that actuator arm right,\nit moves back and forth across\n\n197\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.890\nthe platters much like the record player\ndoes with the record needle right.\n\n198\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.780\nAnd it moves so\nfast that eventually what can happen\n\n199\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.620\nis the bearings in the actuator\nmotor can give way.\n\n200\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.900\nRight and what happens then?\n\n201\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.310\nWell we get intolerance's if\nyou will within the arm itself\n\n202\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.990\nas it moves across the platter.\n\n203\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.910\nGoes up and down right?\n\n204\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.870\nAnd this could be a sign of what's\nknown as a head crash right?\n\n205\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.870\nA head crash is when you actually\nhave the actuator arm itself and\n\n206\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.000\nthe read write head is actually\nbouncing off the platters.\n\n207\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.600\nNow a couple things can happen there.\n\n208\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.050\nIt could be permanent failure.\n\n209\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.220\nIt could be an intermittent failure.\n\n210\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.570\nIf this is an intermittent failure,\nback up your data immediately.\n\n211\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.930\nDo not wait.\n\n212\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.910\nAnd don't try some of the urban legends.\n\n213\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.580\nWell I put the drive in the freezer.\n\n214\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.720\nI'm sure it works.\n\n215\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.270\nI'm sure it can work.\n\n216\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.960\nIt is not 100% that it's going to work.\n\n217\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.970\nThe moment you notice something\nis wrong with that computer,\n\n218\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.460\nif you can turn it on, you better be\nlooking for your backup software.\n\n219\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.120\n&gt;&gt; I've heard it said,\nhope is not a strategy, right?\n\n220\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.349\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nthat's right, absolutely.\n\n221\n00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:13.390\n&gt;&gt; You're hoping these things\ncome back using these techniques,\n\n222\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.372\nthen that is a bad strategy to have,\nthat's not a good strategy.\n\n223\n00:10:16.372 --> 00:10:18.230\nThat's not a strategy at all.\n\n224\n00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.890\nSo, definitely, take, like Wes said,\n\n225\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.430\nif it even hints that it might go out,\nyou better have a good backup, ASAP.\n\n226\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know, we call that\nnormal system maintenance, right?\n\n227\n00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.080\nDon't wait for this to happen.\n\n228\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.090\nYou don't want to wait until you need\nyour backups to take them, right.\n\n229\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.930\nSo do some kinda level of backup.\n\n230\n00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.850\nNow your data is important to you,\nwe talk about corporate data,\n\n231\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.710\nthat goes without saying.\n\n232\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.420\nPeople can lose millions of dollars\nan hour that they don't have access to\n\n233\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.920\nyour data.\n\n234\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.900\nAnd me personally, there's really only one\nform of data that I can't afford to lose,\n\n235\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.010\nand that's pictures of my family.\n\n236\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.980\nAnd the reason I say that,\n\n237\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.000\nthose are captured memories in\ntime that you can't recreate.\n\n238\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.160\nEvery other piece of software, I don't\ncare how expensive it is, I can replace.\n\n239\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.180\nEvery other hardware component,\neven if it hurts, I can replace it.\n\n240\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.050\nSo, your data is important to you,\nwhat data is important to you,\n\n241\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.890\nis really more of a subjective term,\nright?\n\n242\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.710\nThat's going to be whats up to you, so\nkeep in mind, back up your information.\n\n243\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.850\n&gt;&gt; Just to show you why the cloud\ntype storage is becoming very popular\n\n244\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.640\n&gt;&gt; Even with the home user,\n\n245\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.270\nbecause I can log in from anywhere,\naccess my stuff and\n\n246\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.900\nI'm not the one that\nhas to do the backups.\n\n247\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.640\nI'm not the one that has to worry about\nwhether or not my drive goes out.\n\n248\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.930\nMy cloud provider does.\n\n249\n00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.290\nSo, using things like Amazon or just\nas simple as Google Drive or Dropbox or\n\n250\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.130\nsomething can, if you're not already doing\nstuff like that, it can be very helpful.\n\n251\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.077\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and show you how really important\nit is to me, I use both of those.\n\n252\n00:11:40.077 --> 00:11:40.577\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:43.299\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I use Google\nbecause it's on my phone.\n\n254\n00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:44.435\nI use Android devices.\n\n255\n00:11:44.435 --> 00:11:48.575\nIf you're using, for instance, iOS, guys\nwe're not out of the water with Apple too.\n\n256\n00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:53.405\nThey've got great cloud, iCloud is out\nthere, and I have backups, that if I'm\n\n257\n00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:57.020\ntaking my family, I don't know if you do\nthis Dan, you take a picture of your kids,\n\n258\n00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.640\nIt instantly backs up to the cloud, right,\n&gt;&gt; Yep\n\n259\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.740\n&gt;&gt; So I don't have to worry about it.\n\n260\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.780\nSame thing with Dropbox.\n\n261\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.510\nThe reason I say this.\n\n262\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.340\nI use two is I go by this method\nthat it's three, two, one.\n\n263\n00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.090\nAgain, three separate\nbackups of the important\n\n264\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.970\nstuff in two different locations,\none that is physically on me.\n\n265\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.910\nWhen I say physically on me, I could walk\nover to my desk here at ITPro.TV, where us\n\n266\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.860\nhosts and SMEs, where we come up with our\nepisodes and I can pull a hard drive out,\n\n267\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.430\nan external drive and show you that I have\none that is physically on me at all times.\n\n268\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.900\nAnd again,\nthat might be a little excessive, but\n\n269\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.490\nI've learned through the years\nthat you never want, again,\n\n270\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.370\njust like our chat room members says,\nnever assume anything.\n\n271\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Paranoia pays in this business.\n\n272\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nJust because I think everybody's after me,\n\n273\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.888\ndoesn't mean they're not, right?\n\n274\n00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:37.389\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n275\n00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:41.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead, and\nlet's try not to electrocute Wes here,\n\n276\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.270\nif we can look back at this drive, we're\ngonna show you a couple of the symptoms\n\n277\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.362\nthat you can hear and\nwe're gonna show you also how to diagnose.\n\n278\n00:12:48.362 --> 00:12:51.105\n&gt;&gt; Diagnose.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I can say that, thank you.\n\n279\n00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:52.870\n[LAUGH] Diagnose this as we go.\n\n280\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.720\nAll right, so we've got a drive here\nthat I know doesn't work, all right?\n\n281\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.000\nSo one of the things I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna plug the power in.\n\n282\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.960\nNow before we go any farther,\nguys and gals out there.\n\n283\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.900\nKeep in mind, you have to be very careful.\n\n284\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.671\nYou really shouldn't be\ndoing external power supply,\n\n285\n00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:08.306\n[LAUGH] taking your power supply out.\n\n286\n00:13:08.306 --> 00:13:10.830\nBut this is for\nthe purposes of showing you all.\n\n287\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.212\nTaking one for the team, right?\n\n288\n00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:13.045\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wes is a dead man.\n\n289\n00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:13.843\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n290\n00:13:13.843 --> 00:13:17.680\n[LAUGH] showing you all that this,\nwhat are the symptoms?\n\n291\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.440\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna reach over and\n\n292\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.340\nI'm gonna turn this on,\n\n293\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.080\nand if we can bring that camera back\nup here, we're gonna see that, and\n\n294\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.400\nI'm gonna kinda put this to the microphone\nand we'll be quiet, just for a second.\n\n295\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.940\nIt takes a little bit to start up.\n\n296\n00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.903\nAnd you can kinda hear it go [NOISE] and\nyou can hear some scraping.\n\n297\n00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:38.830\nI don't know if you guys can\nhear that out there, right?\n\n298\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.470\nBut that scraping is\nactually a head crash,\n\n299\n00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.000\nnow there's a little bit of clicking,\ntoo, and\n\n300\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.630\nthat's gonna go along with some of the\nother things that we're gonna talk about.\n\n301\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.990\nBut, it's combination of two things,\nwe got a click of death going on there,\n\n302\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.050\nwe've got one that is\njust a click of death.\n\n303\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.380\nBut you could hear a little scraping,\nand now, nothing, right?\n\n304\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.910\nSo, what's happening is, your drive, in\nthis aspect, your drive is going ahead and\n\n305\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.740\nit's trying to index itself.\n\n306\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.240\nIn fact,\nthere's plenty of videos out there,\n\n307\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.690\nwhere they take the covers off of these,\nand\n\n308\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.470\nthey replace them with a plexiglass cover,\nso you can actually see it.\n\n309\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.380\nYou'll see that it actually stops at\nfour points, and, when it starts moving,\n\n310\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.950\nyou can, kinda see those for\npoints there, and it's indexing itself.\n\n311\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.600\nWell, the problem is, it can't do that.\n\n312\n00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.870\nIt can't find those locations, so\n\n313\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.390\nit's clicking against the central spindle,\nright?\n\n314\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.740\nThe cylinder in the middle of it.\n\n315\n00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.970\nAnd it just keeps bouncing off of it.\n\n316\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.160\nThat's the click of death, right?\n\n317\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.150\nThat's a clicking noise.\n\n318\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.800\nNow, it doesn't always just have to\ndo that, but you can hear kind of\n\n319\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.670\na screeching sound, that is actually\nthe head crash that I'm talking about.\n\n320\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.720\nThat is the actuator arm laying\ndown on the platter, all right.\n\n321\n00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:48.685\nTo understand again about the hard drives,\nunderstand that that head actually sits\n\n322\n00:14:48.685 --> 00:14:55.035\naround five, point zero five microns,\nfrom the, or five microns, I think.\n\n323\n00:14:55.035 --> 00:14:56.715\nIt's five millionths of a meter, right?\n\n324\n00:14:56.715 --> 00:15:00.925\nIt's so thin in between there,\nthat even a cigarette ash,\n\n325\n00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:04.835\nsomething as little as a wood ash,\ncould scrape the platters itself.\n\n326\n00:15:04.835 --> 00:15:07.665\nAnd what's happening now,\nis it's actually making contact.\n\n327\n00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:10.170\nRemember, that an actuator had,\n\n328\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.280\nthe RAID write head doesn't make\nphysical contact with a platter.\n\n329\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.680\nIt uses electromagnetic energy to read and\nwrite the data, and\n\n330\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.017\nwhen it makes that scrapping\nsound typically what's\n\n331\n00:15:21.017 --> 00:15:24.220\nhappened is the bearings\nin that head have worn out.\n\n332\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.120\nAgain, it's a moving part and\nit's just sitting down, it's kinda lazy.\n\n333\n00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.690\nSometimes you hear that,\nsometimes you hear the click.\n\n334\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.410\nI will tell you, I was surprised at this\none cuz I've actually turned this on.\n\n335\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:40.550\nDan and I, I was telling Dan I was turning\nit on over at my desk over in the back,\n\n336\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.630\nand it didn't move at all.\n\n337\n00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.290\nSo it's kinda come back\nto life a little bit, but\n\n338\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.960\nwhat happens is it turns around and\nit shuts itself off.\n\n339\n00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.442\nNow that is a telltale sign that\nyou're gonna get a read/write failure.\n\n340\n00:15:50.442 --> 00:15:53.901\nSometimes you'd have no movement,\nthere's zero movement in the drive at all.\n\n341\n00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:56.937\nI've also heard some of them,\nwhen there's a head crash, and\n\n342\n00:15:56.937 --> 00:15:59.459\nthose platters are still\nturning at 7200 RPMs,\n\n343\n00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:03.087\nthat as they spin up they sound like\none of the old bomb raid sirens, right.\n\n344\n00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.552\nAir horns, if you will.\n\n345\n00:16:04.552 --> 00:16:08.055\nAnd as it spins up you can hear\nthe screech just get louder and\n\n346\n00:16:08.055 --> 00:16:10.200\nlouder in a high pitch whine.\n\n347\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.930\nAgain, it's another tell tale sign\nthat we got an issue with the drive.\n\n348\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.270\nNow we've got another drive here and\n\n349\n00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.800\nlet me go ahead in this other drive that's\nnext to the one that we started with.\n\n350\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.670\nIt also has not so much a head crash, but\n\n351\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.720\nit's got the click of death\nthat's going on here.\n\n352\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.150\nAnd this one, I'll go ahead and\nwe do the same thing.\n\n353\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.320\nI'll turn the power on,\nwe'll put this up to the mike and\n\n354\n00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.720\nsee if you can hear what's\ngoing on on this one.\n\n355\n00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.962\nNow we'll go ahead and\nturn this one on, [SOUND], and\n\n356\n00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.363\nyou can hear it kind of cycle,\nplatters are spinning.\n\n357\n00:16:39.363 --> 00:16:45.425\n[SOUND] Now that one's really loud, right?\n\n358\n00:16:45.425 --> 00:16:45.994\n[SOUND] Dan and\n\n359\n00:16:45.994 --> 00:16:49.051\nI were sitting here juking to the beat\nearlier as we were testing this.\n\n360\n00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:50.439\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:16:50.439 --> 00:16:51.276\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] You hear it?\n\n362\n00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.990\nIt's trying to find those indexes and\nit's not.\n\n363\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.092\nAnd, then, listen.\n\n364\n00:16:56.092 --> 00:16:58.241\n[SOUND].\n\n365\n00:16:58.241 --> 00:17:01.712\nIt says sorry I don't know\nexactly what's going on here, but\n\n366\n00:17:01.712 --> 00:17:03.460\nI'm going to turn myself off.\n\n367\n00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.430\nAnd, again, this could be could\nbe a couple things, right?\n\n368\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.430\nNotice that we have, these are called,\nyou know when IDE first came out,\n\n369\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.950\nthe old parallel drives they called\nthem integrated drive electronics,\n\n370\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.820\nand that's because prior\nto IDE drives you'd have\n\n371\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.700\na big expansion card that would\nsit in expansion slot, and\n\n372\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.670\nthat's how you'd make a connection to the\nhard disk, that was the controller, right?\n\n373\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.230\nTime passed and they said, well,\nlet's go ahead and save some space and\n\n374\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.210\nlet's just take that circuitry, and\nas things get smaller, embed it\n\n375\n00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.290\nright into the drive itself, hence the\nname IDE, integrated drive electronics.\n\n376\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.190\nAnd you can see it's still trying to,\nlet me go ahead and shut this off, or\n\n377\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.918\nI might electrocute myself.\n\n378\n00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:40.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.440\n&gt;&gt; And that is a drive controller.\n\n380\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.380\nThe controller could fail too, right?\n\n381\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.890\nIf the controller has failed, then you\nmight hear no movement at all, right,\n\n382\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.630\nbecause you're powering the drive\ncontroller when you connect to it.\n\n383\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.120\nSo, keep in mind that that could happen.\n\n384\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.950\nNow, there's other things\nthat can happen too, right?\n\n385\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.440\nAgain, it's a magnetic drive.\n\n386\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.640\nIf you place this near\na very strong magnet,\n\n387\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.700\nthe platters are so\ndelicately aligned and balanced, right,\n\n388\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.400\nthat you could offset that balance,\nthat could give you a read write failure.\n\n389\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.550\nSo, for instance,\nlet me give you an example.\n\n390\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.330\nWhen they do drive recovery, data\nrecovery, let's say this was a company\n\n391\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.830\nlike, for instance, the insurance\ncompany that Dan used to work for.\n\n392\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.360\nThis could have very,\nvery valuable information and\n\n393\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.910\ncost the company a lot of money.\n\n394\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.880\nSo they can justify the cost to take\nthis to a data recovery agent, right?\n\n395\n00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.610\nThat would try to remove\nthe information off of it and\n\n396\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.600\ngive it back to the organization\nthat's paying for the service.\n\n397\n00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.890\nThey have to so\ndelicately align those platters back\n\n398\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.440\nthat they like to take the whole\nmechanism right out of the drive.\n\n399\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.550\nNot the individual platters, but\nliterally the whole mechanism, so\n\n400\n00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.970\nthat the balance stays correct.\n\n401\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.360\nSometimes, not all the times,\n\n402\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.260\nyou can replace the drive controller\nif you have an identical drive.\n\n403\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.800\nHowever, keep in mind that\nmight not work either.\n\n404\n00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.570\nLet me tell you why.\n\n405\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.570\nThe drive controller has obviously\na logic board that's built into it, and\n\n406\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.760\nit actually writes to\nthe platters a little identifier.\n\n407\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.910\nAnd if there's an identifier mismatch,\nit says,\n\n408\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.450\nI don't know what the heck\nyou're talking about.\n\n409\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.040\nThose aren't the platters that I remember.\n\n410\n00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.670\nSo sometimes you can replace\nthe controller, sometimes you can't.\n\n411\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.830\nI go back to what we initially said.\n\n412\n00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.330\nBack up your information before\nyou even get to this point.\n\n413\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.670\nIf you start to see that\nyou're hearing these things,\n\n414\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.340\nyou're getting intermittent\nfailures within your drives.\n\n415\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.320\nMake sure again that you\ninstantly back up the data.\n\n416\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.640\nIt is important, in fact, I'm going to\nbe fixing a computer later on today that\n\n417\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.450\nhad a Seagate, 7,200 RPM Seagate,\nthat has started to fail,\n\n418\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.840\nand the guy was really brilliant on this,\n\n419\n00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.940\nhe said, I got my data off already the\nmoment that I knew something was wrong.\n\n420\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.290\nI didn't back the machine up or anything,\nbut I knew exactly what I wanted.\n\n421\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.700\nI moved it to an external drive.\n\n422\n00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.630\nAnd later, what we're going to try to do,\nand there's no guarantee that this\n\n423\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.130\nis gonna work, is we're going to try to\ndo a complete system image of the drive,\n\n424\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.640\nwhich means a bit-by-bit replication,\nso that when we put the new\n\n425\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.600\ndrive in we can just apply that bit by bit\nimage back to the new drive and hopefully\n\n426\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.880\nall the applications are there and\neverything, but at the very least he's got\n\n427\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.800\nhis information and it's on an external\nand now we can do some data recovery.\n\n428\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.110\nAll we have to do is reinstall\nthe operating system and\n\n429\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.150\npull that information back down\nto the machine and luckily for\n\n430\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.970\nhim, he should be good and\nnot dead in the water, right?\n\n431\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now Wes, is there where we would\ncome into and the misses for awhile,\n\n432\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.220\nobviously, and I'm kind of setting you\nup for this, but, defrag is something,\n\n433\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.620\nI'm sure,\nthat our viewers out there have heard of.\n\n434\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.590\nYou've got to defrag your drive.\n\n435\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.360\nYou start having drive problems,\ndefrag the drive.\n\n436\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.300\nIs that still a viable solution nowadays?\n\n437\n00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n438\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.380\nI'll say the only place that that's really\nnot a viable solution is on solid state\n\n439\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.850\ndrives, that it's just because they\noperate a little bit different,\n\n440\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.010\nhow they write the information.\n\n441\n00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.420\nBut on these mechanical drives,\nyou better believe it.\n\n442\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.980\nOne of the things you might notice\nwithin your drive is slow performance.\n\n443\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.020\nNow slow performance can happen for\na couple of different reasons, right?\n\n444\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.770\nSlow performance quite literally could be\nthat you have an older standard, right?\n\n445\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.370\nA lot times slow performance can\nhappen fora few different reasons.\n\n446\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.330\nOne of the reason could be we like to\nblame everything on malware and viruses-\n\n447\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.771\n&gt;&gt; Everything is malware and viruses.\n\n448\n00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:16.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right everything is malware\n\n449\n00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:16.850\nand viruses.\n\n450\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.100\nIf you get something like a worm\nif you will, or a virus right,\n\n451\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.460\nthat's doing file replication.\n\n452\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.600\nIt replicates it's self all over,\nyou might see that it's consuming\n\n453\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.080\nyour resources, starts slowing\ndown the performance of the drive.\n\n454\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.730\nThe other thing too,\nis the capacity of the drive.\n\n455\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:35.158\nAs you fill up a drive, right,\nthe more information, you get closer and\n\n456\n00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:37.917\ncloser to the overall\nlimit of the capacity,\n\n457\n00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:41.269\nyou see start to see performance\ndegradation as well.\n\n458\n00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:45.927\nDan, you asked about defragmentation, what\nends up happening within your drive is\n\n459\n00:21:45.927 --> 00:21:50.058\nwhen you remove a file or you delete\na file, understand that at the physical\n\n460\n00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:54.452\nlevel, and I mean literally the magnetic\nlocations, right, that that data is\n\n461\n00:21:54.452 --> 00:21:58.942\nphysically stored on the drives,\nit doesn't remove the information, right?\n\n462\n00:21:58.942 --> 00:21:59.670\nThis is why, and\n\n463\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.894\nI know you've been in many of the forensic\nshows that we have around here,\n\n464\n00:22:02.894 --> 00:22:06.014\nthis is why they can do forensics on\ninformation, they can pull it out,\n\n465\n00:22:06.014 --> 00:22:10.050\nwhether it's a criminal investigation,\nor even data recovery, right?\n\n466\n00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.530\nSo what happens, all right?\n\n467\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.690\nWell, when you delete a file from\nyour hard drive, you're essentially\n\n468\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.870\nturning the blind eye in the operating\nsystem to where it is, right?\n\n469\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.500\nYou have a master file table.\n\n470\n00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.040\nThat's a logical thing,\nwhere it's the software itself\n\n471\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.650\nthat applies a logical blueprint over\nthe structure of the drive, right?\n\n472\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.060\nWell, what you're doing is you're taking\nan erases in the operating system, for\n\n473\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.520\nlack of a better term, and\nyou're deleting the pointer to that file.\n\n474\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.250\nAt the physical level, you did nothing\nto that data, that data is still there.\n\n475\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.210\nWell here's the problem, over the course\nof time, what you're doing when you're\n\n476\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:47.045\ndeleting files, you're moving files,\nyou're leaving these spaces that that,\n\n477\n00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:51.625\nessentially, might still have data in\nthem, might have broken files in them.\n\n478\n00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:56.775\nKeep in mind that our goal is to\ncontiguously store information.\n\n479\n00:22:56.775 --> 00:23:00.195\nAnd I quite literally mean,\nthink of a walkway.\n\n480\n00:23:00.195 --> 00:23:04.134\nIf I have a walkway, let's say going out\nthe back door, out to the tool shed,\n\n481\n00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:08.010\nright, and I've got nice even walkway\nwith blocks one after the other,\n\n482\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.800\nI could stride right on out of there,\nno problem, right?\n\n483\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.220\nBut if I start taking\na couple of blocks here and\n\n484\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.600\nthere, out of the walkway,\nnow I got to work harder, I might have to,\n\n485\n00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.980\nat certain point, hop over one of\nthe steps to get to the next one.\n\n486\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.710\nUnderstand that your drive controller\nin your operating system have to do\n\n487\n00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.660\nthe same thing.\n\n488\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.760\nWhen you start deleting files,\nand you rewrite or\n\n489\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.020\nadd to the same file,\nthat maybe you're adding to a file and\n\n490\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.780\nmaking it bigger, it doesn't line\nthe block up right in that missing space.\n\n491\n00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.690\nIt puts it at the end of the walkway,\nright.\n\n492\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.160\nAnd that's really not convenient\nif you think about the fact that\n\n493\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.480\nthat's not going to help me get\nout to the tool shed, right?\n\n494\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.670\nSo what happens, right?\n\n495\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.708\nThat's file fragmentation,\nso when we do a defrag,\n\n496\n00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:50.151\nwhat we're doing is we're really\nrealigning the bricks and\n\n497\n00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:54.217\nthe walkway to be nice and contiguous so\nit makes a better performance.\n\n498\n00:23:54.217 --> 00:23:59.682\nSo slow performance could be because,\nwe'll get that right there,\n\n499\n00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:04.502\nbecause of the fact that you\nmight have File fragmentation.\n\n500\n00:24:04.502 --> 00:24:08.431\nLet me show you a couple places in\nthe operating system that you can\n\n501\n00:24:08.431 --> 00:24:12.300\nlook when it comes to your different\nissues that you might face.\n\n502\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.820\nAnd some of the things that\nyou can do to remedy that.\n\n503\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.341\nSo here in File Explorer, you'll see\nthat we've got our local disk C.\n\n504\n00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:20.635\nA couple different ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n505\n00:24:20.635 --> 00:24:23.994\nYou can actually go ahead and\nclick on, for instance, This PC and\n\n506\n00:24:23.994 --> 00:24:26.085\nit shows you the local drive right here.\n\n507\n00:24:26.085 --> 00:24:29.612\nOr you could go into the Explorer\nbar side of this and\n\n508\n00:24:29.612 --> 00:24:32.330\nyou could do Local Disk C as well there.\n\n509\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.877\nBut I like, for instance,\n\n510\n00:24:33.877 --> 00:24:37.660\nI like this view because I can see\nwhat is the capacity of the drive.\n\n511\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.300\nNotice we're still in the blue here,\nright?\n\n512\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.240\nEarlier operating systems might\nhave it go from green to red.\n\n513\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.120\nThis is something that you also have.\n\n514\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.205\nYou have the ability to see if you've got\na graphical user interface inside of your\n\n515\n00:24:48.205 --> 00:24:52.110\nLinux-based systems and your Mac-based\nsystems, you can see these as well too.\n\n516\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.040\nJust happen to be in\na Windows-based machine, so\n\n517\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.680\nyou can see that it's right here.\n\n518\n00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.409\nAll right, typically, when you right-click\non the drive here, on Windows,\n\n519\n00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:02.205\nyou'll see that we have a series\nof right-click options.\n\n520\n00:25:02.205 --> 00:25:06.124\nAnd the one that I'm really looking for\nis this Properties option, right here.\n\n521\n00:25:06.124 --> 00:25:10.240\nAnd if I select Properties, you'll notice\nthat I can get a lot more information\n\n522\n00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.100\nabout the used space and the free space,\nand that's, really, what we need.\n\n523\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.890\nNow notice that I have this little\nbutton here that says Disk Cleanup.\n\n524\n00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.090\nNow Disk Cleanup isn't a defragmenter,\n\n525\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.600\nall right,\nwe're gonna get to that here in a second.\n\n526\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.250\nBut one of the things that I can\ndo is always do a Disk Cleanup.\n\n527\n00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.570\nAnd as it calculates\nthe information right here,\n\n528\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.860\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna say,\nhey, you got some temporary files.\n\n529\n00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.870\nWe've seen some log files here,\nmaybe some internet files.\n\n530\n00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.360\nAnd there's a way that if you run this in\nan administrative mode, it also says, hey,\n\n531\n00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.370\nwe've got some system log files and\n\n532\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.970\nsome system temporary files\nthat we can clean up, right?\n\n533\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.230\nWe can run this utility, once it gets done\nscanning we can select exactly what it\n\n534\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.450\nis that we wanna remove from the drive.\n\n535\n00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.930\nLet's see if it gave me any information.\n\n536\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.850\nThere we go, Dan.\n\n537\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.460\nLooks like it didn't take too long there.\n\n538\n00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.500\nAnd you can see these are some of\nthe files that you just really\n\n539\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.040\nmight not need, right?\n\n540\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.830\nAnd I could sit here and\nI could come through here and\n\n541\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.980\nI could select each one of these,\nif I wanted, in turn.\n\n542\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.240\nAnd I could say, you know what,\ngo ahead and clean these up.\n\n543\n00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.014\nNow to save a little bit of time here,\n\n544\n00:26:09.014 --> 00:26:11.770\nwhat I'm not going to do is\nrun the administrative one.\n\n545\n00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.450\nUnderstand that the administrative\none puts a few more entries in there.\n\n546\n00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.000\nIt puts things like your system\nlogs that maybe you wanna delete.\n\n547\n00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.500\nYou do have to be an Administrator.\n\n548\n00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.962\nA standard user can perform this\nwithout having to have Administrator\n\n549\n00:26:23.962 --> 00:26:25.910\npermissions or privileges.\n\n550\n00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.600\nAnd then I can turn around and\nI can say Okay.\n\n551\n00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.924\nAnd then it asks me one more time,\ndo I wanna delete those files,\n\n552\n00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:35.520\nand if I want to I can let it go through\nthe process of deleting those files.\n\n553\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.008\nNow, while that's running in the\nbackground, shouldn't take too long there.\n\n554\n00:26:39.008 --> 00:26:41.177\nActually it's kinda moving\nalong quick there and\n\n555\n00:26:41.177 --> 00:26:43.100\nI don't think it showed\nme any any results.\n\n556\n00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.322\nI could probably go in Event Viewer and\nsee some of the results of what happened.\n\n557\n00:26:47.322 --> 00:26:49.360\nNotice here you also have Tools here.\n\n558\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.935\nTools is important too and\nnotice this is what's known as Check Disk.\n\n559\n00:26:52.935 --> 00:26:57.280\nC-H-K-D-S-K if you are in Command Prompt.\n\n560\n00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.110\nLet me go ahead and\n\n561\n00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.830\nshow you that you also have a graphical\nuser interface version of this.\n\n562\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:08.250\nYou also have the CLI, the Command Prompt\nif you will, inside of Windows.\n\n563\n00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.343\nAnd if you ever wanna find out\nwhat are the options there,\n\n564\n00:27:11.343 --> 00:27:14.643\nyou can do a C-H-K-D-S-K\nforward slash question mark.\n\n565\n00:27:14.643 --> 00:27:17.980\nAnd you can see we have a whole lot\nof different options that we can run.\n\n566\n00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.391\nYou get a lot more flexibility here in\nthe command line and as you guys go on,\n\n567\n00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:24.170\nespecially you guys that maybe\ngo out of Windows into Linux.\n\n568\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.920\nYou'll understand there's a lot\nmore power down in the terminal or\n\n569\n00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.238\ncommand line than there typically\nis in a graphical user interface.\n\n570\n00:27:30.238 --> 00:27:33.715\nAnd that's because if they don't code in\nthe graphical user interface a little\n\n571\n00:27:33.715 --> 00:27:35.920\nclickety button,\nyou don't get the functionality.\n\n572\n00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.820\nBut it is good that you can do this right\nhere and I'll go ahead and run this, and\n\n573\n00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.450\nit's gonna prompt me with\nthe user account control.\n\n574\n00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:42.970\nRemember guys,\n\n575\n00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.360\nwe're gonna get in our operating system\na lot more inside of the 902 series.\n\n576\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.827\nKeep in mind that what we wanna do here\nis just kinda show you what's going on,\n\n577\n00:27:51.827 --> 00:27:52.530\nall right?\n\n578\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.182\nNotice it says,\n\n579\n00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:55.890\nit tells us right away this is\nactively happening in the background.\n\n580\n00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.930\nIt says we haven't found any errors,\nbut you can scan it if you wanted to.\n\n581\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.760\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this.\n\n582\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.802\nAnd then one of the the last things\nDan mentioned about defragmentation,\n\n583\n00:28:03.802 --> 00:28:06.959\nI know it's a long scenic approach to\nget back to your question there, bud.\n\n584\n00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:09.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this is the one, optimize and\n\n585\n00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:13.750\ndefragment a drive And you can see, it's\ncalled the Drive Optimizer today, guys.\n\n586\n00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.010\nFor the longest time,\nit's been Disk Defragmenter.\n\n587\n00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.707\nIt's the same thing, guys.\n\n588\n00:28:18.707 --> 00:28:24.100\nAnd because these are solid state drives,\nnever run optimization is not available.\n\n589\n00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.420\nThey don't want you to run\nthe solid state drives.\n\n590\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.700\nBut if this was a mechanical drive,\nI could do analyze and\n\n591\n00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.300\nfind out if it recommends a defragmenter.\n\n592\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.760\nThat takes almost just as long as the\ndefragmentation, so I just go ahead and\n\n593\n00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.910\nI say defragment it anyways, it's kind\nof just that preventative maintenance.\n\n594\n00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.610\nSo, you do have the ability to do that.\n\n595\n00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.180\nOne of the last things that I might\nmention is, you also have, and I'm not\n\n596\n00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:51.840\nsure if they're gonna ask you this on the\nexam, but you do have the ability to do.\n\n597\n00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.610\nIt's kind of easy inside\nof the Command Prompt.\n\n598\n00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.640\nLet's see, it's easy if Wes can spell.\n\n599\n00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.670\nDefrag and it's .exe but\nthe exe is implied.\n\n600\n00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.270\nYou don't actually have to put exe.\n\n601\n00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.110\nBut you can see that it performs,\nagain, analysis on the volumes as well.\n\n602\n00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.683\nSo a few of the different things you can\nsee when you come across the fact that\n\n603\n00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:14.730\nmaybe you have slow performance\ninside of your machines.\n\n604\n00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.019\nYou can run these utilities,\nknow some of the symptoms,\n\n605\n00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:20.400\nknow some of the things to check, know\nsome of the software that you can have.\n\n606\n00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.840\nAnd at the end of the day, Dan, you might\njust have to replace the drive, right?\n\n607\n00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.304\nIt might be dead duck in the water and\nrather than sit there and watch it float,\n\n608\n00:29:27.304 --> 00:29:29.040\njust go ahead, throw it away.\n\n609\n00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.649\nIf you can't get your\ninformation off of it,\n\n610\n00:29:31.649 --> 00:29:36.054\ngo out to one of your favorite hardware\nstores and I mean computer hardware.\n\n611\n00:29:36.054 --> 00:29:36.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n612\n00:29:36.796 --> 00:29:37.444\n&gt;&gt; Hammer might help too.\n\n613\n00:29:37.444 --> 00:29:44.220\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] So just a couple\nof the things you need to keep in mind.\n\n614\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.842\nBut certainly isn't\nthe end of the list here.\n\n615\n00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:51.380\nBut Dan's showing me that we might\nhave to put a comma in this episode.\n\n616\n00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and we're gonna have to\ntake a little siesta, and come back and\n\n617\n00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.950\ndo another episode,\nbecause we are out of time for this one.\n\n618\n00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.450\nBut, we did get to cover\nsome of the most common and\n\n619\n00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.300\nmajor malfunctions that could occur.\n\n620\n00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.800\nAnd even got into some of the tools that\ncan help us to try to check these things,\n\n621\n00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.840\nand see if something\nis actually a problem,\n\n622\n00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.980\nmaybe even fix the thing, who knows.\n\n623\n00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.790\nThat being said, it looks like we are,\nlike I said, out of time for this episode.\n\n624\n00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.357\nDefinitely come back for part two,\nas for this one goes, signing off for\n\n625\n00:30:16.357 --> 00:30:18.597\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n626\n00:30:18.597 --> 00:30:19.558\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:08.063\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:11.939\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:13.812\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:16.338\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:18.008\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.983\nin today's episode it's more in our A+\nseries, we're actually continuing our\n\n9\n00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:25.280\nconversation on common problems\nwith hard drives and RAID arrays.\n\n10\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.310\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto continue that very conversation,\n\n11\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.140\nour good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.840\nWes, how's it going today, man?\n\n13\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.090\n&gt;&gt; Man, it is going great,\ngood to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.880\nI am just so psyched that we\nsurvived the first episode.\n\n15\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.860\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; Because we were\n\n16\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.750\nplaying with electricity, right?, [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.160\nSo, great to be here.\n\n18\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.010\nThat's right, we're gonna move\nalong in our troubleshooting hard\n\n19\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.930\ndrives as well as communicating a little\nbit more on things like RAID arrays.\n\n20\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.210\nI know it's in the title, guys, I swear it\nis coming up, but as we go through this\n\n21\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.260\nlist we also have to check out some of\nthe individual hard drives as well.\n\n22\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.500\nMoving on in the list that we have here,\nwe're going to talk about failure to boot,\n\n23\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.550\nand I'm going to go ahead and do a couple\nof these in the same demonstration,\n\n24\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.490\nbecause they can manifest\nthemselves in a lot of ways.\n\n25\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.040\nFailure to boot, right?\n\n26\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.065\nFailure to boot quite literally could be\nsome of the things that we talked about,\n\n27\n00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:12.990\nread/write failures.\n\n28\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.180\nOne of the things you have to do is\nthe operating system is located on that\n\n29\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.040\nhard drive.\n\n30\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.880\nAnd it's gonna be pulled\noff of the hard drive.\n\n31\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.590\nIt's gonna be thrown into the volatile\nmemory source that is RAM.\n\n32\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.040\nAnd then,\nfrom there it bootstraps the hardware,\n\n33\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.550\nstarts to take over the control of\nthe hardware, right?, and then, we get\n\n34\n00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.000\nto hopefully the ability to log into\nthe machine and start using the computer.\n\n35\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.610\nAll right, well,\nread/write failures happen, right?\n\n36\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.460\nWell, that's gonna happen.\n\n37\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.380\nIf you hear that click of death right\nthat loud clicking noise, well,\n\n38\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.780\nthat's also gonna cause a failure\nto boot the operating system.\n\n39\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.480\nAnd in that case you might have to use\nsome kind of file recovery software\n\n40\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.890\nif you can.\n\n41\n00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.190\nSometimes you can't even do that.\n\n42\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.960\nSometimes you can use\nan external enclosure.\n\n43\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.550\nYou might hear the term, Drive Sled,\nand again, this just little box,\n\n44\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.400\nif you will, that you can pull\nthe drive out of the machine.\n\n45\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.350\nAnd basically, plug it into this external\nenclosure and then typically through USB,\n\n46\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.150\nyou just plug it right back into the\ncomputer, another computer I should say.\n\n47\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.601\nAnd then,\nhopefully you can gain access to that.\n\n48\n00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.820\nYou can actually couple the two as well.\n\n49\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.700\nYou can do file recovery software\nwith an external enclosure.\n\n50\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.500\nBecause sometimes, you know,\nyou're gonna need a little bit more power,\n\n51\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.050\nif you will, and it's just not as\nsimple as just taking the drive out,\n\n52\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.270\nand plugging it into another one.\n\n53\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.980\nAll right, so\nthat is some of the things that we do.\n\n54\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.200\nFailure to boot might be\nan all out mechanical failure.\n\n55\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.730\nIf it's a mechanical failure, you're gonna\nhave to use some of the other techniques\n\n56\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.310\nthat we've already discussed in the first\npart of this episode, or this series,\n\n57\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.660\nif you will,\n[LAUGH] that we're working on.\n\n58\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.740\nNow, there's other things that could\ncause a failure to boot, right?\n\n59\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.410\nAs we move into our\noperating system portions,\n\n60\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.980\nreally in the 902 exam,\nwe'll talk a lot more about the OS.\n\n61\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.940\nBut there are some things, very basically\nwhen it comes to storage devices,\n\n62\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.040\nthat you have to know about the software,\nthe operating system, more specifically.\n\n63\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.080\nWhen it goes to bootstrap the hardware.\n\n64\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.960\nSo, what are we talking about?\n\n65\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.870\nWell, inside of your operating system, we\nhave what's known as a master boot record.\n\n66\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.650\nIf you're talking about traditional bios\nit uses an MBR a master boot record.\n\n67\n00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.540\nIf you're talking about the unified\nextensible firmware interface right\n\n68\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.370\nthe later successor to bios,\nBoth are still used today.\n\n69\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.590\nOne's considered legacy.\n\n70\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.760\nOne's considered more modern.\n\n71\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.720\nThe UEFI uses something that's akin\nto a master boot wrecker, right?\n\n72\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.580\nIt helps to bootstrap\nthe operating system.\n\n73\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.560\nThat's called GPT, or\nthe GUI partition table.\n\n74\n00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.020\nNow, keep in mind that if we\ncan't access that information,\n\n75\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.530\nthen we can't start the computer, right?\n\n76\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.430\nAnd that could cause a failure to boot.\n\n77\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.330\nKnow that you could really find that\nout very early on in the start up\n\n78\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.210\nprocess when you reach over and you push\npower on the computer, and here's why.\n\n79\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.110\nWe talked about the basic input\noutput system pretty extensively in\n\n80\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.870\nanother episode.\n\n81\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.987\nWe talked about how it to sends\na little electrical signals out, and\n\n82\n00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.298\nit really starts your hardware,\nstabilizes it.\n\n83\n00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:03.941\nAnd then, one of the last things that\nBIOS does is looks for that boot record,\n\n84\n00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:07.250\nthat boot code that helps\nthe operating system come online.\n\n85\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.185\nWell, even before that BIOS has stored in\nit what's known as the power on self test,\n\n86\n00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.325\nright, it's called post.\n\n87\n00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:17.125\nEvery machine that has a logic board in\nit, a lot of times is gonna run post.\n\n88\n00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.535\nBelieve it, or not, your cars out there\ntoday, with all the computing systems that\n\n89\n00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:25.375\nthey have in them, run through a potential\nof hundreds of power-on self tests\n\n90\n00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:28.375\nquite literally when you turn\nthe key in the ignition, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.845\nAnd what is power-on self test?\n\n92\n00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:32.540\nAgain, post this is the BIOS saying,\n\n93\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.150\nokay, I'm gonna send\nan electrical signal to the CPU.\n\n94\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.540\nI'm gonna send an electrical signal to the\nRAM, to the Video Sub-system if you will,\n\n95\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.870\nand as well the hard drive.\n\n96\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.410\nI'm gonna see if I can start\nthe hard drive up, right?\n\n97\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.080\nAnd if it receives a signal back\nthat says, hey, we're here,\n\n98\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.010\nit's kinda like a built\nin self-diagnostic.\n\n99\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.870\nNow, one of the last portions that\nhappens in that post process, and\n\n100\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.950\nit's the BIOS as well, is that it looks\nand tries to read that boot code.\n\n101\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.670\nThat boot code is loaded in the memory,\nand it's what allows bi ops to\n\n102\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.390\ntransfer control of the hardware over\nto the operating system, and ladies and\n\n103\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.580\ngentlemen, out there I don't care if\nyou're running a windows machine.\n\n104\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.630\nI don't care if you're a Newnex machine,\na Linux machine, a Mac.\n\n105\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.300\nEveryone of those systems is going\nto go through a power on sub test.\n\n106\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.290\nNow, if it can't find that\nboot record what happens?\n\n107\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.430\nFails to bootstrap the operating system,\nthe operating system doesn't allow you to\n\n108\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.030\nlog in, and a lot of times you will have\nwhat is known as a POST error that will\n\n109\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.670\nhappen in a low resolution on the screen,\nand it might say, failure to boot.\n\n110\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.599\nThe other thing that might happen\nis it might say, OS not found.\n\n111\n00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.480\nNow, there's a couple of things\nthat the OS not found might happen.\n\n112\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.520\nLet me tell you why.\n\n113\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.880\nBecause inside of your BIOS you have\nwhat's known as a boot sequence.\n\n114\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.270\nAnd the boot sequence says, where does\nthe BIOS look for that boot code.\n\n115\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.190\nAnd there's a few different locations\nthat it can actually find that boot code.\n\n116\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.940\nOne of the locations it can\nfind it is the hard drive.\n\n117\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.040\nNow, I want you to understand in the boot\nsequence, a lot of times not all the time,\n\n118\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.650\nyou have to pay attention to your BIOS and\nhow it's configure, or UAI file.\n\n119\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.620\nUse them interchangeably, cuz essentially\ntheir firmware starting hardware.\n\n120\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.180\nWhat happens is,\nthe hard drive is set last.\n\n121\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.310\nAll right, and\nthere's a good reason for that, right?\n\n122\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.180\nIf I need to run some kind\nof recovery software,\n\n123\n00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.290\nfile recovery software, let's say, we\nwork for the United States government, or\n\n124\n00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.860\nmaybe your over there in Europe, right?,\nand you have some data standards that you\n\n125\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.910\nneed to follow, and we need to make\nsure that we securely erase information.\n\n126\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.290\nWell, if we're always booting to\nthe hard drive we don't get a chance to\n\n127\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.890\nrun that software prior to\nthe operation system coming online.\n\n128\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.960\nSo, what do we do?\n\n129\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.460\nWe look for the boot code, typically in\nplaces like the optical drive, right?\n\n130\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.300\nAllows me to install my operating system.\n\n131\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.480\nCould be a USB drive\nthat we made bootable,\n\n132\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.440\nand we've actually got some boot code in\nthere, and there's an operating system,\n\n133\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.530\nor at least an operating system installer.\n\n134\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.370\nWe plug it into the computer in\nthe USB port and we tell it, hey,\n\n135\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.730\nBIOS go on ahead and look there, so\nthose are a couple of locations.\n\n136\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.880\nThe other real cool location\nis a network adaptor.\n\n137\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.640\nBelieve it, or not your network adaptor\nhas a small bit of firmware in it that can\n\n138\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.720\nload a very slimline highly optimized\nportion of the TCIP protocol stack.\n\n139\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.050\nAnd it can call up to the network and say,\n\n140\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.360\nhey, you got an operating\nsystem out there?\n\n141\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.130\nI could really use one.\n\n142\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.120\nStandard clients do this when we're trying\nto deploy operating systems to multiple\n\n143\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.960\nmachines rather than going computer,\nto computer,\n\n144\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.680\nto computer installing optical disks,\nright, or USB drives.\n\n145\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.910\nThe other thing that happens is\nthin clients do this as well.\n\n146\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.570\nRight, we talked about in another\nepisode the custom PC types.\n\n147\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.030\nThin clients a lot of times don't\neven have their operating system\n\n148\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.540\ninstalled locally.\n\n149\n00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.573\nWhat they do is they call out\nto the network and they say,\n\n150\n00:07:31.573 --> 00:07:34.345\nhey, anybody out there got an operating\nsystem, because you know what?,\n\n151\n00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:36.064\nI'm not going to run if\nyou don't give me one.\n\n152\n00:07:36.064 --> 00:07:40.667\nAnd a lot of times there's a server out\nthere that uploads, or over the network\n\n153\n00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:45.230\ndownloads a small highly optimized\noperating system that's stored in RAM.\n\n154\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.073\nSo, those are the locations we\ncan find in the boot sequence.\n\n155\n00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:53.194\nAnd then, if the master boot record,\nor the unified GPT as it's called.\n\n156\n00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:57.571\nThe GUID Partition Table is what\nUEFI uses, if it doesn't find that,\n\n157\n00:07:57.571 --> 00:07:58.917\nit halts the system.\n\n158\n00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:02.490\nWe get an operating system not found and\nfailure to boot as well okay?\n\n159\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.770\nNow what if it's corruption?\n\n160\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.040\nWell if it's corruption that's also gonna\ncause a problem and it's gonna fail to\n\n161\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.670\nboot the operating system and again we\ndon't get to log in to the computer.\n\n162\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.430\nThat's a problem.\n\n163\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.825\nBut one of the great things is, I guess\nit's not a great thing if it's corrupted.\n\n164\n00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:19.030\n[LAUGH] But one of the things is,\n\n165\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.210\nyou're not completely out of\nthe water yet, you do have\n\n166\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.340\nthe ability to run some kind of utilities\nthat can help you re-build this right.\n\n167\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.050\nI believe there's utilities\nthat can re-build your boot\n\n168\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.320\nrecord inside of a Windows\noperating system.\n\n169\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.710\nI believed in Dan's, I know Dan\nhere loves, absolutely loves Linux.\n\n170\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.390\nI believe there's utilities\nthat can help you re-build\n\n171\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.840\nthe grub boot loader which is\nwhat Linux is using if you will.\n\n172\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.330\nI'm not sure exactly about Mac.\n\n173\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.648\nI'll defer you guys to our [LAUGH]\nMac shows on that one and Don Pezet,\n\n174\n00:08:46.648 --> 00:08:48.203\none of our Mac gurus around here.\n\n175\n00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:50.240\nBut again,\nyou do have the ability to go and\n\n176\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.470\ntour some kind of what's known as\na recovery environment, right?\n\n177\n00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.500\nNow you might be able to do this inside of\nthe operating system, but keep in mind,\n\n178\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.510\nif you're already in the operating system,\nwe don't get the failure to boot and\n\n179\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.622\nyour operating system was found.\n\n180\n00:09:01.622 --> 00:09:06.370\nAll right, so I'm going to do this from\na Windows perspective, in general.\n\n181\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.920\nAnd you know Dan, let me go ahead and,\nlet me kind of make it clear here.\n\n182\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.210\nWhen I say I´ve got a Windows machine,\n\n183\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.150\nmore specifically I´ve got what´s known\nas the Windows recovery system, right?\n\n184\n00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.940\nBecause if we can´t boot\nthe operating system,\n\n185\n00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.700\nwe need a way we can actually\ntry to fix some stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.740\nWell, Windows has what´s known as\na preinstallation environment.\n\n187\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.980\nAnd what we mean by that is the fact that\nit´s actually sitting inside of RAM.\n\n188\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.080\nAnd it really isn't from\nthe hard drive because again,\n\n189\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.540\nwe don't have access to\nmaster boot record, right?\n\n190\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.500\nYou'll see this in a things like\nLinux Live, CDs as well the ability to\n\n191\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.540\ntest the operating system and run it\nfrom RAM without actually installing it.\n\n192\n00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.590\nSo a lot of good technology out there, in\nfact I've actually used the Linux Live CD\n\n193\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.880\nrepair a Windows machine too so\nthat's kind of funny too.\n\n194\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.340\nSo if we go ahead and we continues into\nthe recovery environment you can see that\n\n195\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.200\nwe have well, the troubleshoot option,\nand that's what we want to see.\n\n196\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.710\nA couple of different things we could do,\nwe could reset the PC.\n\n197\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.600\nI don't want to do that.\n\n198\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.320\nWhat I'm really worried about or\nfocused on is the advanced options here.\n\n199\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.799\nAnd if I select advanced options,\n\n200\n00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.580\nnotice we get a couple different\nthings that we can do, right.\n\n201\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.360\nYou can see system restore here and\n\n202\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.460\nwe'll talk about all of these goodies\nhere, Icould do a startup repair.\n\n203\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.160\nAnd that would try to automate\nthe process for me and\n\n204\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.970\nsometimes it does fix the problem.\n\n205\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.110\nSo I do want you to know that if you\ncan't boot the operating system or\n\n206\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.600\nthe operating system isn't found this\ncould run through an automated process and\n\n207\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.450\nit can try to get you back\ninto the operating system.\n\n208\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.630\n&gt;&gt; I like automation.\n\n209\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.690\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah,\nit makes it a lot easier.\n\n210\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.180\nNow there's other things\nthat we can do too.\n\n211\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.220\nWe can go into some startup settings.\n\n212\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.880\nAnd again keep in mind this\none might not work either,\n\n213\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.610\nbecause we're failing to\nstart the machine anyways.\n\n214\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.310\nThis is where you can get into\nsomething known as safe mode.\n\n215\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.740\nBut what I want to see,\nis I want to see this command prompt.\n\n216\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.220\nAnd when I run this command prompt,\n\n217\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.080\nunderstand that it's going to run\nit from the administrative level.\n\n218\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.880\nAnd what's gonna go is it's going\nto kind of reboot the system and\n\n219\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.730\nit's going to prompt me,\nif you will, with an admin password.\n\n220\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.390\nIt's going to say, okay, well, when we\n\n221\n00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.570\nrestart this what going to actually happen\nand we can bring up my machine here,\n\n222\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.270\nyou can see that it's actually\npreparing the command prompt.\n\n223\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.890\nIt has to do this at\nan administrative level, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.970\nThe way I entered\nthe recovery environment,\n\n225\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.070\nI cannot run this as a standard user,\nall right?\n\n226\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.440\nSo that's a problem, right?\n\n227\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.660\nSo you have to be an administrator.\n\n228\n00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.930\nAnd that's kinda why it did\nthis little restart on me here.\n\n229\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.920\nAnd I apologize ahead of time for\nthe little matted lines.\n\n230\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.980\nWe're running in what's known as VGA mode.\n\n231\n00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.680\nNo drivers are loaded at this time so\nit's not gonna give you the nice,\n\n232\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.500\ncrisp resolution.\n\n233\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.330\n&gt;&gt; It will give you a simple\nenvironment to work with.\n\n234\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.040\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n235\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.280\nA very minimalistic, great way to put it.\n\n236\n00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.220\nSo if we, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll choose the admin.\n\n237\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.700\nI'm not too creative with my names here.\n\n238\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.120\nAnd I can remember that admin,\nchances are is an admin.\n\n239\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.950\nAnd I also do apologize ahead of time,\n\n240\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.510\nbecause usually what we like to do\nhere in our shows is make this so\n\n241\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.776\nthis is not satellite view and you guys\ncan actually see what's going on here.\n\n242\n00:11:51.776 --> 00:11:55.960\nSo again, I kinda apologize ahead of time,\nbecause it's just very minimalistic and\n\n243\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.600\nvery low resolution and\nwe'll go ahead and change this around.\n\n244\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.320\nAnd we kinda maximize it.\n\n245\n00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.381\nLet me do a cd backslash and\ngive us a little bit more real estate, and\n\n246\n00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.520\nwe kinda look at what's going on here.\n\n247\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.460\nNow inside of your machines and\nI will tell you on the exam,\n\n248\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.910\nthey call out one that is\nknown as bootrac, right?\n\n249\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.650\nThis is the boot recovery utility that we\nfail to boot, that might be something that\n\n250\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.400\nwe have to do and we might have to\nrebuild the master boot record.\n\n251\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.720\nSo if you're not sure what these commands\nare, just remember type bootrec.\n\n252\n00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.360\nAnd we got to zoom in on that.\n\n253\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.850\nType bootrec here, if you will,\nand then also remember\n\n254\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.000\nto type the forward slash question mark,\nand when you run this.\n\n255\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.140\nYou'll get a lot of output and it tells\nyou some of the things that you can do.\n\n256\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.430\nLike for instance, FixMbr, right.\n\n257\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.260\nIt tells you right there.\n\n258\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.512\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what that does?\n\n259\n00:12:40.512 --> 00:12:41.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,right.\n[LAUGH] And\n\n260\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.650\nif we don't know well that's great.\n\n261\n00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.720\nWe could scroll through and\nyou can see it,\n\n262\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.270\nit basically rewrites the master boot\nrecord to the boot, the system partition.\n\n263\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.100\nNow, what if the system partition,\nagain a container that,\n\n264\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.390\nwell contains the master\nboot record is corrupt?\n\n265\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.380\nWell the great thing is,\n\n266\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.750\nthat's where we get the other\noption right, that's /FixBoot.\n\n267\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.930\nNotice it says writes a new boot\nsector to the system partition.\n\n268\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.265\nSo if that system partition itself,\n\n269\n00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:12.185\nthe container that the MBR is held in gets\ncorrupt, well we've got an option, right.\n\n270\n00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:16.514\nNow, there's another thing that we can do\nhere that I wanna mention real quick as\n\n271\n00:13:16.514 --> 00:13:19.340\nwell, and that's called rebuild the BCD.\n\n272\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.961\nSee in the earlier XP days,\n\n273\n00:13:20.961 --> 00:13:25.410\nyou'd use a file to tell the bios how\nto boot-strap the operating system.\n\n274\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.260\nIt was called boot.ini.\n\n275\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.640\nWell, to come into compliance with\nthe unified extensible interface,\n\n276\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.420\nthey kind of, and this goes all\nthe way back to the days of Vista.\n\n277\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.370\nThey kinda had to rebuild their\narchitecture to fall in line with that\n\n278\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.270\nUEFI standard.\n\n279\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.590\nSo now what we use is something known\nas the boot configuration data store.\n\n280\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.590\nAnd it basically tells the operating\nsystem where the operating system is,\n\n281\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.770\nhow to bootstrap it,\nwhich is the main operating system,\n\n282\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.290\ncuz you could have more than\none on your hard drive.\n\n283\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.680\nIt's not as common today with things like\nvirtualization but what this does is,\n\n284\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.360\nit scans all the disks and\nit will reboot, or excuse me, I'm sorry,\n\n285\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.290\nrewrite, it says boot configuration store.\n\n286\n00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.700\nSomething know as the BCD.\n\n287\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.820\nSo you have the ability to run that.\n\n288\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.810\nThat's what's called out on the exam,\nthe boot recutility.\n\n289\n00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:14.160\nI do want to take a second and let you\nknow that, hey, not only can we rebuild\n\n290\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.860\nthe BCD, but they also have something\nknown as, what's known as BCD edits.\n\n291\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.020\nAnd you can also run this too and when you\nrun this, this is a very powerful tool.\n\n292\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.070\nIt really does a lot.\n\n293\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:33.300\nYou can just try the basic if\nyou will rebuilding the BCD.\n\n294\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.430\nIn fact, let me show you Dan here\nwe'll kind of look at this, right.\n\n295\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.060\nYou can see the boot configuration data.\n\n296\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.340\nProvided it's there,\nremember if it's not, there's corruption,\n\n297\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.170\ngo ahead and run the boot recovery\nutility or bootrec and then rebuild BCD.\n\n298\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.490\nBut I can do an enum, and\nthat's short for enumeration, and\n\n299\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.860\nI can actually see the information\nthat's it's pointing to.\n\n300\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.140\nThe boot manager, right?\n\n301\n00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.880\nAnd it tells me that it's on partition C,\nright.\n\n302\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.020\nI can see it's on C Drive, and again, this\nis the boot manager, it's called boot.exe.\n\n303\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.620\nIt's what's responsible for\nbooting the operating system.\n\n304\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:12.340\nAnd then what it looks for\nis what is known as the winload.exe.\n\n305\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.360\nNow that's the specific,\nwhat loads if you will and\n\n306\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.230\nstarts to bootstrap the operating system.\n\n307\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:23.230\nSo the boot manager can manage multiple\nwindows if you will, loaders right.\n\n308\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.210\nSo again, one that's the manager of them,\nthat says, hey I control you.\n\n309\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.350\nYou've got more than one\nWindows operating system.\n\n310\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.630\nI can control those and point to,\nin this case we only have one.\n\n311\n00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.050\nThere's your winload.exe.\n\n312\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.630\nSo this is the information.\n\n313\n00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.420\nRemember I told you UEFI uses\nthe GUID partition table?\n\n314\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.870\nWell, that's an example\nright there of a GUID.\n\n315\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.835\nThat's a globally unique identifier.\n\n316\n00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:49.983\nAnd it is using that instead of\nthe earlier master boot record.\n\n317\n00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:52.458\nAgain, guys, we'll go more into\nthis in our operating system.\n\n318\n00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:57.130\nBut it really is directly related to some\nof the concepts that we talk about when it\n\n319\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.090\ncomes to getting into your operating\nsystem if we do have a failed drive.\n\n320\n00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.880\nAll right so some of the things that you\ncan see when it comes to things like\n\n321\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.930\nfailure to boot as well as OS not found.\n\n322\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.500\nNow there are a couple other\nthings that they call out too.\n\n323\n00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.680\nThey call it something known\nas drive not recognized.\n\n324\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.520\nAnd when we talk about\ndrive not recognized,\n\n325\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.990\nthis could be a couple of things,\nall right?\n\n326\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.145\nAnd one of the things that it could be\nis the fact that we have one of those\n\n327\n00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.260\nread-write failures, right?\n\n328\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.400\nWe have one of the hard drives\nthat's had a head crash, right?\n\n329\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.110\nWe had in our chat room here earlier\nwhen we took our last break between\n\n330\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.710\nthe episodes.\n\n331\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.220\nOne of our members said he's actually\nsee where the head crash and\n\n332\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.250\nit was so devastating that it peeled off\nthe magnetic layer on the outside of\n\n333\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.690\nthe platters, revealing the aluminum\nthat was underneath itself.\n\n334\n00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.340\nAgain it could be catastrophic,\nyou might not come back from it, right.\n\n335\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.220\nThe other thing that drive\nnot recognized might be,\n\n336\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.690\nwell, it might be the fact that you\ndon't have the cables hooked up, right?\n\n337\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.680\nSome of the things that we talked\nabout in the very first part\n\n338\n00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.090\nof these episodes that\nwe're going through.\n\n339\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.620\nBut let's go ahead, and one of the things\nthat we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n340\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.360\ndemonstrate when a drive isn't recognized.\n\n341\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.050\nAnd some of the things that you can check\nin order to not only diagnose it, but\n\n342\n00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.770\nalso kind of the visual inspections\nthat you can do within the system unit\n\n343\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.030\nto try to remedy this problem.\n\n344\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.540\nNow we're gonna go ahead and what we have\nto do is kinda use the magic of TV here.\n\n345\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.210\nAnd when we come back we're gonna look\nat is not only the, the BIOS information\n\n346\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.430\na little bit, but we're also gonna do\na visual inspection on the machine.\n\n347\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.550\nAnd kinda do a little bit of show and tell\nhere rather than just all of this speaking\n\n348\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.212\nso that you guys can see what some of\nthe hands on stuff will look like.\n\n349\n00:17:30.212 --> 00:17:33.170\nAll right Dan, so\nwe've got this thing open.\n\n350\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.650\nWe've got the guts of\nthe computer where we can see it.\n\n351\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.550\nNow on the motherboard,\n\n352\n00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.300\nthe first thing you'll notice is\nright here down, in this, this area.\n\n353\n00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.910\nI know it's kind of hard to see so\nI'll shine a light down there and\n\n354\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.420\nyou can kind of see where\nthe data cables are, right.\n\n355\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.850\nThe data cables connect and that's one\nof the things when we talk about, for\n\n356\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.510\ninstance, Drive not recognized or\nOS not bound.\n\n357\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.790\nRemember, we gotta make sure that\nthose SATA cables are connected.\n\n358\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.460\nAnd you can see that as this snakes\naround, it comes back to the hard drive\n\n359\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.210\nitself and you can see that, well,\nwe've got the data cable here and\n\n360\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.290\nI know that little tab makes\nit easier to take off.\n\n361\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.210\nBut, there's your seven pin data cable.\n\n362\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.800\nAnd we also have to make sure that\nwe have our 15 pin power connector.\n\n363\n00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.550\nNow if we look at a wire shot of this you\ncan see that the power supply, basically\n\n364\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.935\nsnakes back up here and goes into\nthe back of the the power supply as well.\n\n365\n00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:26.095\nSo those are your basic connections, and\nif any one of those isn't connected,\n\n366\n00:18:26.095 --> 00:18:29.105\nyou might have a series of the problems\nthat we've been mentioning.\n\n367\n00:18:29.105 --> 00:18:32.085\nNow, what we wanna do is we wanna kinda do\nsomething a little bit cooler than this,\n\n368\n00:18:32.085 --> 00:18:35.155\nand we wanna kinda show you\nsomething that you would really see\n\n369\n00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:36.715\nif one of these drives failed.\n\n370\n00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:39.995\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna actually take this drive,\n\n371\n00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:43.740\nand we'll go ahead and we'll connect\nthe data cable itself, right?\n\n372\n00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.050\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and I'll\nconnect the 15 pin power connector here.\n\n373\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.030\nMake sure that I get\nthat in the right place.\n\n374\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.330\nI love these blade connectors.\n\n375\n00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.948\nIt makes it a lot easier.\n\n376\n00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:55.950\nAnd we're gonna set that right here.\n\n377\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.800\nAnd I also have,\nif I can get these cables out of the way,\n\n378\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.210\nI've got four more of\nthe serial ATA connectors here.\n\n379\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.060\nAnd what we'll do is we'll go ahead and\n\n380\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.620\nwe're going to connect\nthe serial ATA connector here so\n\n381\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.710\nnow that this hard drive, again this\nis the one that had the head crash.\n\n382\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.740\nIt's failed.\n\n383\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.990\nWe know that we've got it\nconnected to the motherboard.\n\n384\n00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.600\nI know that I've got power and the data\ncable and what we wanna do is we're gonna\n\n385\n00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.828\ngo ahead and start this computer up and\nthen we're gonna boot into the bios and\n\n386\n00:19:24.828 --> 00:19:30.350\nsee if it'll run some kind of diagnosis,\nright, or diagnstic on it.\n\n387\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.570\nOr if it'll see at all, so\n\n388\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:37.320\nyou can kinda get a visual of what a true\nfailure on a hard drive would look like.\n\n389\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.220\nSome of the things that you\ncan do to diagnose it and\n\n390\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.420\nreally what the bios will see.\n\n391\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.400\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nput this machine back together so\n\n392\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.460\nwe don't have one that's\ncompletely open here.\n\n393\n00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.500\nAnd when we come back we'll\nbe looking at a bios screen.\n\n394\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.405\nAll right so let's go ahead.\n\n395\n00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:51.444\nWe're gonna get into the BIOS.\n\n396\n00:19:51.444 --> 00:19:55.807\nDan, if you would do the honors, go ahead\nand press power on that computer here and\n\n397\n00:19:55.807 --> 00:19:58.100\nlet's see what it is\nthat we would look at.\n\n398\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.680\nSo here's our screen and\n\n399\n00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.210\nI'm hitting F12 on this one to\nboot into the one time menu.\n\n400\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.400\nKeep in mind that every computer is gonna\nbe a little bit different on how you get\n\n401\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.690\ninto your BIOS.\n\n402\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.190\nAnd you can see some of\nthe options here that we have.\n\n403\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.880\nAll right, again we talked about\nthings like boot sequence.\n\n404\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.300\nHere's a little bit of\nthat boot sequence here.\n\n405\n00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.850\nBut let's go ahead and what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna get into the some of\n\n406\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.890\nthe settings that we can see within BIOS.\n\n407\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.230\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n408\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.370\nWe'll go ahead and\nget into the BIOS setup and\n\n409\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.360\nthis is where we can see some\nof the different settings.\n\n410\n00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.100\nNow, depending on what\nkind of BIOS you have,\n\n411\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.960\nyou might have the ability to use a mouse.\n\n412\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.010\nSometimes you don't have\nthe ability to use a mouse.\n\n413\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.730\nDell has a pretty cool\nsetup in the fact that they\n\n414\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.770\ndo give you the ability to\nuse your mouse as well.\n\n415\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.480\nSometimes you just have\nto use your keyboards.\n\n416\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.590\nNow we hooked that drive up,\nremember the one that has failed.\n\n417\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.450\nSo we want to kind of look at that.\n\n418\n00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.050\nIf I go ahead and I get in here and I\nactually look at the system configuration.\n\n419\n00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.630\nIf I can do that,\nI'm gonna tell you what, I'm so\n\n420\n00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.610\nused to using the key board we'll just\ngo ahead and use the keyboard there.\n\n421\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.805\nNotice that we have a series of, well,\njust different locations, right?\n\n422\n00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:03.730\nYou'll see we have a system\nconfiguration here, right,\n\n423\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:09.230\nwe got the the set operation if you will,\nand more importantly, I have drives here.\n\n424\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:14.660\nNow if you look you'll see that on the\nright hand side, at the top there SATA-0,\n\n425\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.020\nnotice that it says a 500GB hard drive,\nright, HDD.\n\n426\n00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.390\nNotice that the second one says,\nwell that's our optical drive.\n\n427\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.100\nThose were the two that we've\nseen plugged in before I\n\n428\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.650\neven plugged in that third hard drive.\n\n429\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.700\nDan, notice what we don't see in two or\nthree.\n\n430\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.110\n&gt;&gt; We don't see our new\ndrive that we plugged in.\n\n431\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, it says none and\n\n432\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.920\nthat's a telltale sign that something's\nwrong with the hard drive, right?\n\n433\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.840\nWhen it says drive not,\nit isn't recognized.\n\n434\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.160\nIt says none.\n\n435\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.950\nNow it's plugged into the board.\n\n436\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.870\nYou guys have heard already\nit's one of those drives that I\n\n437\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.040\nheld up to the microphone, right, and\nyou can hear it kind of screeching or\n\n438\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.450\nthe other one that was clicking.\n\n439\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.690\nNotice how the drive isn't\nrecognized inside of BIOS, right.\n\n440\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.920\nThat is again a telltale sign that there\nis something wrong with the drive itself.\n\n441\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.550\nNow, let's go ahead and there are a couple\nof different things that we can do and\n\n442\n00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.220\nwe might have to restart this machine.\n\n443\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.280\nLet me check and see if,\nI can't remember if maintenance,\n\n444\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.060\nthis is in this system logs or cloud\ndesktop, and it doesn't look like this is.\n\n445\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.810\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n446\n00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:21.320\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to\nreboot this machine one more time, and\n\n447\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.670\nwhat we'll do is we'll look at\nthe diagnostics that it has.\n\n448\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.720\nA lot of these machines will have some\nkind of onboard built into the ROM chip.\n\n449\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.590\nSome kind of small footprint\nsoftware that allows you to do this.\n\n450\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:37.157\nNow one of the things that you can do to\nalmost about any machine is that when you\n\n451\n00:22:37.157 --> 00:22:40.052\nneed to reboot it in BIOS,\nCtrl+Alt+Delete.\n\n452\n00:22:40.052 --> 00:22:43.387\nRight, so we'll go ahead,\nwe'll do our Ctrl+Alt+Delete and\n\n453\n00:22:43.387 --> 00:22:46.852\nhopefully that will give us the ability\nhere to reboot the machine.\n\n454\n00:22:46.852 --> 00:22:49.572\nNow you can see it kind of\njust rebooted real quick, and\n\n455\n00:22:49.572 --> 00:22:54.570\nI'm hitting F12 on the keyboard here as we\nspeak to get back into that system, right?\n\n456\n00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.550\nNow notice that we have\nsome other options, right?\n\n457\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.640\nWe talked about, for instance, we have\nthe BIOS Setup that we just looked at.\n\n458\n00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.600\nBut notice that we have this\nDiagnostic option, all right?\n\n459\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.310\nNow we'll go ahead and what we're gonna do\nis, we're gonna boot into the diagnostics,\n\n460\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.227\nand what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo ahead, and if I remember right,\n\n461\n00:23:09.227 --> 00:23:10.182\nwe can do Escape here.\n\n462\n00:23:10.182 --> 00:23:11.527\nWe'll see if that actually works.\n\n463\n00:23:11.527 --> 00:23:15.828\nI'm not sure, it might work sometime, okay\nthere it did, cuz it automatically just\n\n464\n00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:19.674\nstarts going through this list and\ntrying to diagnose everything, right?\n\n465\n00:23:19.674 --> 00:23:24.619\nWell here's the thing, we've got a problem\nwith some of the hard drives, right?\n\n466\n00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:28.700\nOne of them really isn't working, in fact\nwe might not even see it in this list.\n\n467\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.880\nLet's go ahead and do a little\ndiagnostic on the hard drive itself.\n\n468\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.900\nNow notice we got drive zero\nhere is the one that is running.\n\n469\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.780\nI might not even be able\nto diagnose anything right?\n\n470\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.921\nAs this goes through it might give me some\nkind of warning that says hey I checked\n\n471\n00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:46.629\nthe cables, cables look good.\n\n472\n00:23:46.629 --> 00:23:49.487\nEverything looks fine, let's go ahead and\n\n473\n00:23:49.487 --> 00:23:54.213\nlet's run through the hard drive itself\nand see if we can access a drive.\n\n474\n00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:58.923\nNow, I will tell you,\nsometimes this might not work, right?\n\n475\n00:23:58.923 --> 00:24:03.550\nYou might find that I can't gain\naccess to that drive at all.\n\n476\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.390\nAll right?\n\n477\n00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.900\nIn this case,\nyou might not get any kind of beep,\n\n478\n00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.840\nyou might not get any kind of error.\n\n479\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.940\nSometimes you'll get a very,\nvery loud beep, when it comes and\n\n480\n00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.580\nit says okay well,\nI can see something's plugged into there,\n\n481\n00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.430\nI'm not exactly sure what's plugged\ninto there but I can't access it.\n\n482\n00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.660\nRight?\nAnd what it'll do\n\n483\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.350\nis it will throw some kind of\nerror that comes back and,\n\n484\n00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.470\nagain, gives you some audible warning and\nI don't know, did you hear that?\n\n485\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.300\n&gt;&gt; I definitely heard that.\n\n486\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthat is, believe it or not,\n\n487\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.270\nthat's actually a good warning because\nthat's drive 0 that has been detected and\n\n488\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.030\nnotice it says everything's passed.\n\n489\n00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:47.820\nHowever, there are certain times\nwhen it doesn't pass, and then it'll\n\n490\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.500\nthrow some kind of warning on the screen\nthat lets you know some kind of failure.\n\n491\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.380\nIn fact, I can't remember,\nthis one might have the system logs,\n\n492\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.580\nlet me get to the event logs and show you.\n\n493\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.490\nI can't remember if this one still has it.\n\n494\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.920\nI actually ran this on one of the drives\nearlier, there we go, there's an example.\n\n495\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.100\nOkay?\n\n496\n00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.060\nSo here's an example of the system\nlogs that of a diagnostic that I did,\n\n497\n00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.570\nnot on this drive here, this drive here,\n\n498\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.495\nis so dead in the water that\nthe motherboard doesn't even see it.\n\n499\n00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:17.565\nWhen you get a click of death,\n\n500\n00:25:17.565 --> 00:25:21.345\na lot of times the drive controller can\nstill communicate with the BIOS, but\n\n501\n00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:24.595\nwhat it fails to do is actually\nmove the internal components.\n\n502\n00:25:24.595 --> 00:25:29.615\nIt looks like the drive controller and\nthe head crashes happen on that first one,\n\n503\n00:25:29.615 --> 00:25:31.185\nwhich means that's really bad.\n\n504\n00:25:31.185 --> 00:25:31.915\nOkay?\n\n505\n00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:35.025\nBut notice these are some\nof the errors that you see.\n\n506\n00:25:35.025 --> 00:25:36.245\nRight?\nIt says it failed.\n\n507\n00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:38.900\nRight?\nIt couldn't access the drive,\n\n508\n00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.521\nit couldn't access it all,\nit couldn't move it.\n\n509\n00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:43.480\nAll right?\nSo\n\n510\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.110\nthese are some of the things you can see,\nwhen it comes down to you fixing or\n\n511\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.440\ndiagnosing systems.\n\n512\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.760\nSometimes you have these\nabilities to run on-board tests,\n\n513\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.140\nthat can happen, as well, if it happens to\nbe a non-boot drive and it's a data drive.\n\n514\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.510\nYou might be able to\nrun the format command.\n\n515\n00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.390\nYou might be able to fun\nsomething like DiskPart,\n\n516\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.460\nwhich we'll definitely show you when\nwe get to the operating section.\n\n517\n00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.665\nDisk management inside of Windows, is the\ngraphical user interface that we can run.\n\n518\n00:26:11.665 --> 00:26:16.030\nRemember, DiskPart is the command line\ninterface that allows us to manage,\n\n519\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.950\nmaintain, create, delete partitions,\n\n520\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.530\napply file systems, that might be\nsomething that we have to do as well.\n\n521\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.750\nNow, we've shown you\na few different things,\n\n522\n00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.520\nways that you can diagnose this too.\n\n523\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.700\nThe other thing that you might be able\nto do, as well, is do a SMART Operation.\n\n524\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.760\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\n\n525\n00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.690\nI'm gonna reboot the BIOS here, and\nif we can check that out, let's go ahead.\n\n526\n00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.280\nI’m gonna reboot this and I might,\n\n527\n00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.880\nI don't know if the control,\nit did work on that one.\n\n528\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.960\nUsually Ctrl+Alt+Del will work,\nlet me get back into the BIOS setup,\n\n529\n00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.530\nbecause I do want to mention the SMART\nOperation, it is in the list and it really\n\n530\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.420\ndoes come down to the fact that you\nneed to make sure that it is turned on.\n\n531\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.310\nAnd if we do, let's see here,\nI believe that's under\n\n532\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.172\njust basic system configuration,\nand there we go, SMART Reporting.\n\n533\n00:26:59.172 --> 00:26:59.930\nAll right?\n\n534\n00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:04.500\nSMART here is the self-monitoring analysis\nand reporting technology, and it's\n\n535\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.970\nbuilt into the hard drives, and it can be\npart of the BIOS and the drive controller.\n\n536\n00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.030\nI will tell you that, many people have a\nlove-hate relationship with this software\n\n537\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:18.749\nand the fact that they love to hate it,\nand that's because it can be inconsistent.\n\n538\n00:27:18.749 --> 00:27:21.760\nAnd, it's not really the SMART Operation\nthat can be inconsistent, it's the fact\n\n539\n00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.810\nthat it's giving inconsistent errors,\nsometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n540\n00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.660\nThe other thing that's really, that\ncould be a little difficult about SMART,\n\n541\n00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.670\nSMART isn't really built for\n\n542\n00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.680\nthe average end-user, or\neven sometimes the average tech.\n\n543\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.830\nA lot of times, SMART comes down\nto the fact that that's more for\n\n544\n00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.260\nthe drive manufacturers themselves,\ncuz the output that a SMART Operation or\n\n545\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.900\na SMART Error provides.\n\n546\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.080\nSometimes its so difficult to\nunderstand even what's going on,\n\n547\n00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.072\nthat you can't even\ninterpret the information.\n\n548\n00:27:49.072 --> 00:27:52.570\nSometimes you have a software,\nright, that you can see and\n\n549\n00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:56.470\nit can interpret that information.It can\nload the SMART area into the software,\n\n550\n00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.160\ngives you a nice little\ngraphical user interface,\n\n551\n00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.140\nthat you can kind of diagnose\nwhat the problem might be.\n\n552\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.845\nKeep in mind,\n\n553\n00:28:03.845 --> 00:28:08.210\nthat if your drives are under warranty,\nyou might be able to return them.\n\n554\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.970\nAll right?\n\n555\n00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:14.510\nThe main thing to keep in mind though\nis that if you have the chance,\n\n556\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.240\nall right, and\nyou really don't have an excuse,\n\n557\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.984\nif you are under normal operations\nyou should be running back ups.\n\n558\n00:28:20.984 --> 00:28:21.630\nRight?\n\n559\n00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.720\nBecause these problems\nwill manifest themselves.\n\n560\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.820\nUnderstand it's not a matter of if,\na component's gonna fail,\n\n561\n00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.575\nit's a matter of when.\n\n562\n00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.080\nRight?\n\n563\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.260\nThere's a certain lifetime,\nthey call it a,\n\n564\n00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.660\nwhat is it, a meantime between failure,\nI believe it is, MTTF.\n\n565\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.931\nAnd it just says, how many\noperations are we gonna get, right,\n\n566\n00:28:40.931 --> 00:28:43.500\nread-write operations,\nare we gonna get within this drive or\n\n567\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.960\nthis storage device\nbefore it finally fails?\n\n568\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.990\nSo again, keep in mind, it's not\na matter of if it's going to fail,\n\n569\n00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.390\nit's a matter of when it's gonna fail.\n\n570\n00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:56.260\nYour drives, believe it or not, are\nfailing on a daily basis, but they have\n\n571\n00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.650\nsoftware, they have logic built into them,\nthat allows the drive controller to kind\n\n572\n00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:05.750\nof do on the fly diagnostics and\nrepair itself or move, if you will,\n\n573\n00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.015\ninformation around failed sectors within\nthe drive and you're not even aware of it.\n\n574\n00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:10.660\nRight?\n\n575\n00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.670\nWhen we use some of these utilities\nwe have, we're forcing it to do it,\n\n576\n00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.080\nwe're telling it, do that now.\n\n577\n00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.250\nRight?\nBut believe it or not,\n\n578\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.910\nit's doing it on a daily basis,\ncuz again, it's a magnetic,\n\n579\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:25.820\nmechanical device that is constantly\nfailing overall in its overall life cycle.\n\n580\n00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.670\nThe problem is, some of the failures is so\ngreat, that we do need these third party\n\n581\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.300\nsoftware or software that's built in\nthe operating system, in order to fix or\n\n582\n00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.460\ndiagnose these problems or both.\n\n583\n00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.140\nAll right?\nBackups, run your backups,\n\n584\n00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.380\nthat is important.\n\n585\n00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.800\nNow, we do have a few more things\nthat we kind of wanna round off,\n\n586\n00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.300\nwe still wanna look at RAID.\n\n587\n00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.690\nWe've been talking this whole entire\ntime and in the title is RAID arrays and\n\n588\n00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.160\nwe haven´t talked about those yet.\n\n589\n00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.990\nBut, Dan's over here telling me that\nwe might have to save that one for\n\n590\n00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.655\na third part.\n\n591\n00:29:54.655 --> 00:29:58.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don´t think we have quite\nenough time to get into RAID diagnostics,\n\n592\n00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.700\nbut that's not a problem,\nwe'll make a part three.\n\n593\n00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.550\nSo definitely join us for\n\n594\n00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.340\nthat one, but what like Wes was alluding\nto, we are out of time for this episode.\n\n595\n00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.610\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n596\n00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.400\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n597\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.644\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n598\n00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:18.583\n[MUSIC]\n\n599\n00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.265\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:13.088\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Alright, greetings everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:16.021\nand welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.650\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.795\nIn today's episode we are working,\nstill, on our A+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:24.030\nThat's right, it's the never-ending\ncertification, right?\n\n9\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.400\nSo much information.\n\n10\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.964\nAnd joining us back in the studio to\ncontinue to shivel that information into\n\n11\n00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:30.979\nour little brains so\nwe can pass that exam.\n\n12\n00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.670\nOur good friend, Mr.Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.230\nWes, we're so glad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.690\nAnd how's it going?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.900\nYou say that so eloquently.\n\n16\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.798\nIt sounds like,\nI don't know if it's a good thing or pain.\n\n17\n00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:40.298\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:41.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n19\n00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:44.160\nDan is right.\nThere's a lot of information you need to\n\n20\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.660\nunderstand and\na lot of a lot of good information.\n\n21\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.964\nA lot of stuff really that you could\npotentially run into in your I.T.\n\n22\n00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:52.932\ncareer and specifically as you\nare leapfrogging into I.T..\n\n23\n00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:56.797\nSo, that's right we are back with just\na few things we have to kinda look at what\n\n24\n00:00:56.797 --> 00:00:59.159\nwhen it comes to\ntroubleshooting hard drives.\n\n25\n00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.714\nAnd well this concept we've been\nmentioning in the title since we first\n\n26\n00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:05.816\nstarted, way back 20 years ago,\n[LAUGH] called RAID array.\n\n27\n00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:06.752\nTrouble shooting RAID array.\n\n28\n00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:10.258\nRemember in the past episode we kind\nof talked about what raid was and\n\n29\n00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:14.570\nshowed you some of the different kinds\nthat you can expect to see on the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.120\nRemember it's a way to take,\na couple of disks or more.\n\n31\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.070\nAnd we bond them, or\naggregate them together.\n\n32\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.530\nAnd we can do this for\na couple of reasons.\n\n33\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.555\nWe can do this for performance gain.\n\n34\n00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:26.911\nWe could speed up the time that it takes,\nto get access to that information, or\n\n35\n00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.360\nto write to that hard drive.\n\n36\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.610\nOr, we can do this for the purposes of\nensuring that if one of the drives fails,\n\n37\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.480\nwe still have access to the information\nthat is so crucial to us and\n\n38\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.930\nour businesses, right?\n\n39\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.160\nWe talk about the difference\nbetween RAID 0 and RAID 1, right?\n\n40\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.020\nRAID 0 is striping that gives\nus the performance, if you will.\n\n41\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100\nRAID 0 is mirroring that gives as fault\ntolerance dual copies of your data,\n\n42\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.170\ntalk about RAID 5.\n\n43\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.260\nTries to give you the best of\nboth worlds if you will its\n\n44\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.610\nthat striped thing with\ndistributed parity.\n\n45\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.745\nSo that if one of the drives fails your\nstill operational unlike mirror if one of\n\n46\n00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:04.330\nthe drives fails well you're out of the,\nyour out of luck, right?\n\n47\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.890\nBut you still have access to your data.\n\n48\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.560\nNow, that being said,\nwe will talk about full tolerance, right?\n\n49\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.010\nOr, we will talk about failure.\n\n50\n00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.250\nHow does a failure\npotentially manifest itself?\n\n51\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.621\nWell, sometimes, it doesn't, right?\n\n52\n00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.775\nThere's a couple of things that\nthey talk about RAID not working,\n\n53\n00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:23.675\nthey also call out RAID not found,\nall right?\n\n54\n00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:28.013\nSo let's go ahead and let's kinda\njust dive into a couple of things\n\n55\n00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:32.200\nthat might cause this and\nsometimes it can be hardware, right?\n\n56\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.960\nIt can be hardware failure, but\n\n57\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.050\nsometimes it can be configuration error,\nconfiguration error could cause it.\n\n58\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.711\nIf somebody misconfigures the RAID\narray and that can cause problems.\n\n59\n00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:44.510\nIt could cause you to\nnot find the RAID array.\n\n60\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.620\nIt could cause it to not work, right?\n\n61\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.910\nThe other thing I also want you to\nkeep in mind and this is something,\n\n62\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.520\nDan believe it or not I had to deal\nwith in my motherboard that I've had.\n\n63\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.410\nIt's outdated by today's standard but\neven going out the gate,\n\n64\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.560\nwhen I put Windows 7 on it,\nI went to install the operating system.\n\n65\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.479\nI created the RAID array, right?\n\n66\n00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.791\nI went to install the operating system,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:09.353\nwhen it got to the installation\nscreen that we talk about in 902,\n\n68\n00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:13.430\nI didn't see anywhere to install the drive\nor install the operating system.\n\n69\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.750\nSo we had a problem right, and one of the\nproblems was the chipset driver, right?\n\n70\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.326\nWindows didn't have built into its driver\nstore a chipset driver that would allow\n\n71\n00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:26.582\nthe operating system, even in\nthe preinstallation environment, right?\n\n72\n00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:30.490\nThat's loaded into the RAM, to even\nknow that the RAID controller existed.\n\n73\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.570\nSo I had to have a driver.\n\n74\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.371\nI had to have a-\n&gt;&gt; Seems like a problem, [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:34.188\n&gt;&gt; It really is right because the drivers\n\n76\n00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:36.700\nare what allow our software\nto talk to our hardware.\n\n77\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.585\n&gt;&gt; You basically had a guy speaking\nRussian and one speaking Swahali and\n\n78\n00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.935\nanother one,\nI don't know what's your saying, [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:43.660\n&gt;&gt; And zero translator in the middle,\n\n80\n00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.540\nthat's right, so\nwe weren't getting much done.\n\n81\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.000\nAnd that's why I had to have a little USB\nthumb drive, and I plugged it in, and\n\n82\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.890\nhad the driver, and\n\n83\n00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.010\nduring the Windows installation process\nthat we demonstrate in other episodes.\n\n84\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.150\nI could say hey, Windows, that's okay,\n\n85\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.930\nyou don't have that driver\nbuilt into the driver store.\n\n86\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.500\nSo I could point you to it.\n\n87\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.540\nAnd then sure enough,\nit loaded it into RAM.\n\n88\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.640\nAnd then all of a sudden it says, okay,\nI see that storage container there.\n\n89\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.045\nYou can go ahead and\ninstall your operating system there.\n\n90\n00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.024\nSo that could be a reason, right,\nthat you don't see the RAID array or\n\n91\n00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.530\nRAID not found, RAID not working, right?\n\n92\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.390\nRemember, drivers are important.\n\n93\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.862\nYour operating system needs to be able\nto recognize the hardware as well as\n\n94\n00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:22.480\nspeak to it.\n\n95\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.720\nAnd if those drivers aren't there,\nthat might not happen, right?\n\n96\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.246\nIt could be a module, or a service that\nyou're running that is shut off as well.\n\n97\n00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:35.851\nSo again, a couple of things that we talk\nabout before we even mention the hardware\n\n98\n00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.330\nconfiguration, right?\n\n99\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.690\nSo let's go ahead,\n\n100\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.430\nwe've got a machine here that's got\na RAID array already set up on it.\n\n101\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.520\nAnd more specifically, it is a RAID\n1 configuration with a stripe.\n\n102\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.559\nAnd it is a 128 kilobyte block\nsize which means the chunks that\n\n103\n00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:57.278\nare written across the drive and\nthe stripe are gonna be 128 k in size.\n\n104\n00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:59.690\nNow, Dan,\nif you'll do me the honors here and\n\n105\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.680\nwe're gonna look at the BIOS screen here.\n\n106\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.030\nWe'll go ahead and\nlet's boot into BIOS if you will there.\n\n107\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.840\nAll right, and here we can see that\nit is booting in to the system.\n\n108\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.080\nI wanna go ahead, and\none of the things that I'm gonna do,\n\n109\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.160\nis I gotta boot into BIOS,\nthe one-time boot menu.\n\n110\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.098\nLike we mentioned before,\nthese are the Dell machines, so\n\n111\n00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:18.581\nwe're using the F12 here.\n\n112\n00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:21.218\nAnd you can kinda see I went ahead and\nnamed the volume there so\n\n113\n00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:22.725\nwe can see what we're looking at.\n\n114\n00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.145\nSo that's the boot volume, right?\n\n115\n00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:27.495\nAnd I can tell that RAID is recognized\njust because, well, I named\n\n116\n00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:32.040\nthat volume when I created the RAID array\nand you can see Intel A+ RAID0 there.\n\n117\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.900\nNow that isn't something you usually see.\n\n118\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.430\nWe're not actually seeing\nthe RAID configuration.\n\n119\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.910\nBut at least I know for my benefit that,\nhey, I know it can see the RAID.\n\n120\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.180\nNow, what might cause a RAID\narray to not be recognized?\n\n121\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.860\nWell, let's go ahead and\n\n122\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.450\nwe'll get back into the settings like we\ndid earlier when we were looking at BIOS.\n\n123\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.789\nAnd we'll get into the system\nsettings themselves.\n\n124\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.170\nAnd by the way in the background,\n\n125\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.530\nwhat you're seeing is a little\nvoltage change I believe.\n\n126\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.514\nAnd that's probably the CMOS battery\ntelling me cuz I been messing\n\n127\n00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:05.383\nwith this machine a lot,\n\n128\n00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:10.547\nthat it might be time to replace\nthe machine, yeah the CMOS battery.\n\n129\n00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:12.717\nSo what are some other things that might\ncaused the RAID array not to be seen\n\n130\n00:06:12.717 --> 00:06:13.800\nor RAID not found?\n\n131\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.370\nWell, I want you to go ahead and\nlook at the drives here.\n\n132\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.300\nNow when we look and\nget into the drives and\n\n133\n00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.070\nthis is specific to this Dell BIOS\nyours might be a little bit different.\n\n134\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.570\nNotice that we have, for instance, we\nhave what's known as the SATA operation.\n\n135\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.989\nNow the SATA operation understand\nthat we get RAID on, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:36.519\nAnd I'm not so worried about\nsome of the authored attack and\n\n137\n00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:43.142\nadvanced host configuration, of interface\nif you will, what is it, the AHCI or ATA.\n\n138\n00:06:43.142 --> 00:06:48.480\nWhat I'm really worried about for the exam\nhere is the RAID being on or off, right?\n\n139\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.849\nIf I turn around and\none of the things that I do is,\n\n140\n00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.801\nget into, let me tab over here and\nlets see.\n\n141\n00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:59.010\nSometimes you can use\nthe mouse on these things.\n\n142\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.120\nThe interesting thing though is\nthe mouse doesn't seem to want\n\n143\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.300\nto work too well on our\nshiny surface here.\n\n144\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.970\nSo let me get back up to the SATA.\n\n145\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.860\nIs that I could if you will turn this off,\nright?\n\n146\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.388\nI could essentially put this in a legacy\nmode, and notice it says changing these\n\n147\n00:07:14.388 --> 00:07:19.069\nsettings may prevent your operating system\nfrom booting or require a reinstall.\n\n148\n00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.460\nAll right,\nwell that could be a problem, right?\n\n149\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.985\nAnd this is one of the things that cause\nthe RAID array not to be detected.\n\n150\n00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:29.220\nRemember, I said it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a hardware failure\n\n151\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.680\ncould be a misconfiguration, right?\n\n152\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.890\nSomebody could come in here and\n\n153\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.090\nsay, I'm just gonna turn this off\ncuz I don't understand what that is.\n\n154\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.821\nThey go get in here and\nthey go Jiminy clickets on it.\n\n155\n00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:40.230\nAnd unfortunately, now we have a problem.\n\n156\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.650\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay no to this.\n\n157\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.370\nThat certainly isn't\nsomething that you wanna do.\n\n158\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.146\nMy head's kinda covering up, you can\ncan see that we have the Apply option,\n\n159\n00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:47.739\nall right.\n\n160\n00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:50.492\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nexit out of this and\n\n161\n00:07:50.492 --> 00:07:54.591\nwe're gonna try to boot into\nthe RAID configuration itself.\n\n162\n00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:58.439\nSo sometimes this is a little bit\ndifferent On the way you configure it,\n\n163\n00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:01.774\neven though we're in the BIOS itself,\nand I'm gonna say no,\n\n164\n00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:05.660\ndon't change anything here,\ncuz we certainly don't wanna break it.\n\n165\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.090\nWe're gonna let it reset.\n\n166\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.200\nAnd one of the things you're\ngonna notice is that BIOS here,\n\n167\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.353\nit goes through this\ninitial configuration.\n\n168\n00:08:14.353 --> 00:08:17.074\nYou'll see the PXE boot try to start here.\n\n169\n00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:21.603\nBut in the Dell systems here, you'll also\nsee that it'll say configuration, and\n\n170\n00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:25.887\nit says, Ctrl+I, I know that was kinda\nquick and we did that kinda fast here.\n\n171\n00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:29.559\nBut notice that here's where I could\nconfigure the RAID array, right?\n\n172\n00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:33.416\nI could point it to the different disks,\nif you will,\n\n173\n00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:35.829\nwithin the RAID array, itself.\n\n174\n00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:39.556\nNotice that at the top,\nwe've got the RAID ID 0, I named it,\n\n175\n00:08:39.556 --> 00:08:43.480\nthat's what we're seeing in\nthe runtime boot menu there.\n\n176\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.943\nIt tells me the level in the third column\nthere, it says it's a RAID 0, it's\n\n177\n00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:51.140\na stripe, tells me what the stripe block\nsize is and what the overall capacity is.\n\n178\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.365\nNotice that it also breaks down\nthe individual disks that make\n\n179\n00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:55.366\nup the RAID array.\n\n180\n00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:59.689\nAnd it tells me that, hey, what's\nthe status of well, Disk 1 there, right?\n\n181\n00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:01.974\nIn this case Disk 0,\nremember zero counts in binary.\n\n182\n00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:07.740\nSo Disk 0 is one of those members,\nit's 149 gigabytes in size.\n\n183\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.600\nI see Disk 2 is another Western Digital\nwith its ID likewise, and\n\n184\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.280\nthat's another 149 gigabytes.\n\n185\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.156\nRemember when we were\ntalking about RAID array and\n\n186\n00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:20.069\ntrying to figure out what the overall\ncapacity of the RAID array is?\n\n187\n00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:24.507\nAnd a RAID 0 we said, you just add up all\nthe capacities of the drives that make up\n\n188\n00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:26.640\nthe RAID 0 array, and total them up.\n\n189\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.005\nSo you could see, that's why it says there\nat the top that the RAID size is 298,\n\n190\n00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:32.530\nall right?\n\n191\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.477\nSo this is where we would see\nmaybe a potential to recover if we\n\n192\n00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:39.811\ndon't see that RAID array.\n\n193\n00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:41.975\nLet's also give you,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n194\n00:09:41.975 --> 00:09:45.610\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna give\nyou an idea of a RAID failure, right?\n\n195\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.517\nCuz what we see here is normal operation.\n\n196\n00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:51.075\nThat's not really gonna help you, I mean,\ncuz that's what you should see, right?\n\n197\n00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:54.282\nWell, what happens if\nthe drive isn't recognized?\n\n198\n00:09:54.282 --> 00:09:58.410\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that,\nand we'll reboot this machine.\n\n199\n00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.542\nAnd when we come back from\nrebooting the machine,\n\n200\n00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:02.432\nwe'll see if it's a little bit different.\n\n201\n00:10:02.432 --> 00:10:04.562\nSo Dan,\nI'm gonna take the opportunity here,\n\n202\n00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.810\nand I'm gonna see if I\ncan't break this machine.\n\n203\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.288\nAnd then, we're gonna see if we\ncan't bring it back, as well.\n\n204\n00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:11.740\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that,\nand we'll see you in a bit.\n\n205\n00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.427\nAll right, Dan, let's see how\nwell I broke this RAID array, and\n\n206\n00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:18.104\nif you can do the honors there,\nsir, and push power on that thing.\n\n207\n00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:21.245\nWe'll see if we can get\nback into our machine.\n\n208\n00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.240\n&gt;&gt; You've got the nice black screen,\nso far.\n\n209\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's absolutely a great sign, right?\n\n210\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.710\nWe have nothing to look at, and\nyou can see it's kinda booting up here.\n\n211\n00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.490\nSo we'll give a second,\nwe'll let it boot up.\n\n212\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.220\nAnd this time,\nwe're gonna just do a normal boot, right?\n\n213\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.060\nWe're gonna see what happens when\nthis machine starts to load up.\n\n214\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.450\nNow one of the things I can see is that,\nwell, notice right there,\n\n215\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.690\nit says status has failed.\n\n216\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.460\nNotice the stripe there.\n\n217\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.870\nAnd over there at the top column\non the right, we can see Status,\n\n218\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.230\nNo, Bootable, No, right?\n\n219\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.021\nIt says that the drive isn't found.\n\n220\n00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:56.680\nNow it gives me the ability that\nI can run an on-board diagnostic.\n\n221\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.260\nAnd like we've seen earlier\nwhen we run a diagnostic,\n\n222\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.960\nit's gonna go pretty much the same.\n\n223\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.740\nA lot of the Dell on-board diagnostics are\ngonna be the same type of interface, and\n\n224\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.290\nit's gonna do that.\n\n225\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.590\nIt's gonna try to find that drive, right?\n\n226\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:13.780\nWell, at this point, it really probably\nwon't find the drive, all right?\n\n227\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.380\nSo, what happened?\n\n228\n00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.040\nWell, there could be a couple\nthings that happened.\n\n229\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.018\nWe've already talked pretty extensively\nabout connections and power, and\n\n230\n00:11:21.018 --> 00:11:23.355\nyou definitely have to\nmake sure about that.\n\n231\n00:11:23.355 --> 00:11:27.283\nAnother thing that could happen is\nthat the drive is part of the actual,\n\n232\n00:11:27.283 --> 00:11:29.980\nthe drive itself could have failed,\nall right?\n\n233\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.326\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll do a reboot on this machine, and\n\n234\n00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:34.407\nwe'll get into the setup here,\nthe settings again.\n\n235\n00:11:34.407 --> 00:11:38.015\nAnd when we get into the settings, what\nyou're gonna see is we can look a little\n\n236\n00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:41.530\nbit more, actually, I probably,\nlet me go ahead and do that one more time.\n\n237\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.640\nSorry about that guys.\n\n238\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.268\nI don't wanna actually get\ninto the BIOS settings yet.\n\n239\n00:11:44.268 --> 00:11:47.244\nWhat I wanna do is get into\nthe RAID configuration, and\n\n240\n00:11:47.244 --> 00:11:50.295\nsee what the RAID configuration\nutility is telling us.\n\n241\n00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:55.160\nAnd in this case, to get into the RAID\nconfiguration, we're gonna do a Ctrl+I.\n\n242\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.577\nAnd the good thing is, and I don't know\nif you can hear those beeps right there,\n\n243\n00:11:58.577 --> 00:12:00.720\nbut it kinda balked at us-\n&gt;&gt; It's angry.\n\n244\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.319\n&gt;&gt; It is, that's right,\nit isn't too happy at me.\n\n245\n00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:05.640\nAnd notice the difference here, right?\n\n246\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.480\nWe've got one member disk, right?\n\n247\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.450\nAnd RAID controller has a RAID ID,\nit knows that that is a member disk.\n\n248\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.422\nAgain, just part of the RAID\narray that was there before, but\n\n249\n00:12:14.422 --> 00:12:16.204\nnotice that we have a failed status.\n\n250\n00:12:16.204 --> 00:12:21.193\nAnd the failed status is the same thing\nthat we see on the POST screen, all right?\n\n251\n00:12:21.193 --> 00:12:23.356\nNow, we could also boot into BIOS, and\n\n252\n00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:27.520\nwe could see that maybe the fact is\nthat the drive is no longer there.\n\n253\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.960\nSo that is one of the things you can\nsee when a RAID fails, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.100\nSo, what would happen if this\nwas a RAID 0, in this case?\n\n255\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.190\nWell, unfortunately,\nwe've lost all our data, and\n\n256\n00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.013\nhopefully-\n&gt;&gt; You're done like dinner.\n\n257\n00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:41.696\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH] hopefully\nwe've run a backup utility, and\n\n258\n00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:45.430\nwe have our data backed up\nto an external location.\n\n259\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.927\nThe other thing that we're probably gonna\nhave to do here is, we're gonna have to\n\n260\n00:12:49.927 --> 00:12:55.070\nreplace the failed drive, and we're gonna\nhave to rebuild the RAID array, all right?\n\n261\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.630\nSo let's go ahead, what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna replace the failed drive.\n\n262\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.310\nAnd we're gonna reboot this machine, and\n\n263\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.380\nwe're gonna show you exactly how\nyou could rebuild the RAID array.\n\n264\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.482\nSo we'll see you in a bit.\n\n265\n00:13:06.482 --> 00:13:09.410\nAll right, so what we did is we\nwent ahead and essentially, guys,\n\n266\n00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.010\nwe hooked back up the drive.\n\n267\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.750\nWe used a loose connection here as a way,\nDan, if you can help me out here.\n\n268\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.610\nLet's go ahead and\nboot this machine back up, and\n\n269\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.090\nwe'll get back into the RAID\nconfiguration utility.\n\n270\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.416\nNow, understand, if you're replacing\na drive, it's not gonna be so\n\n271\n00:13:23.416 --> 00:13:26.411\nsimple as a, we boot the machine\nback up and it says, well,\n\n272\n00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:29.143\nthere's the member disk that\nwas a part of the RAID array.\n\n273\n00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:33.210\nSo we're gonna take this from the\nperspective that that drive has failed.\n\n274\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.590\nAnd one of the things that we can actually\ndo here is, we can get into the RAID\n\n275\n00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.140\nconfiguration, now you see the member\ndisk has come back online, all right?\n\n276\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.010\nIn the real world,\nif that drive has failed,\n\n277\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.520\nyou wouldn't have that option, right?\n\n278\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.990\nSo, what would we have to do?\n\n279\n00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.500\nWell, what we would have to do is\nbasically delete the RAID array that\n\n280\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.052\nexisted.\n\n281\n00:13:49.052 --> 00:13:52.757\nAnd that would take that member disk\nthat's still kinda hanging on to the past\n\n282\n00:13:52.757 --> 00:13:55.050\nthere [LAUGH] and\nit would completely format it.\n\n283\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.984\nNow, you have to be careful, notice that\nin this one we have number 2 there allows\n\n284\n00:13:58.984 --> 00:14:02.595\nus to delete the RAID volume, and\nit should give us a warning at some point.\n\n285\n00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:05.932\nSometimes it's pop up, sometimes\nit's bold as you can see right here.\n\n286\n00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:08.642\nHey, you better be careful\nin the deletion of this,\n\n287\n00:14:08.642 --> 00:14:11.300\nbecause you are gonna lose\nall of the information.\n\n288\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.030\nNow if this is a mirror, be careful,\ncuz you still have your data.\n\n289\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:20.740\nOne of the first things I would do\nis just clone the entire drive,\n\n290\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.750\nthen delete the volume.\n\n291\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.740\nThat's the purpose of the mirror,\nall right?\n\n292\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.370\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll do the old DEL there.\n\n293\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.610\nAnd, again, it's letting us know, hey,\n[LAUGH] this is gonna be a bad thing,\n\n294\n00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.460\nright, if you do end up\ndeleting the volume.\n\n295\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.290\nNow, what it's doing is, notice that it\nchanged from member disk to Non-RAID disk.\n\n296\n00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.640\nAnd that's letting us know that hey,\nwe do have RAID turned on, but\n\n297\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.760\nnone of the hard drives that are within\nthe system now are a part of a RAID array.\n\n298\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.550\nAnd that's where we go to,\nwell, we could reset all disk.\n\n299\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.440\nWe could do that as well.\n\n300\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.802\nI like to delete the actual RAID volume,\nbecause it removes the ID, and\n\n301\n00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:56.924\nnow we can create the RAID volume.\n\n302\n00:14:56.924 --> 00:14:59.050\nNow, we can name this whatever we want.\n\n303\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.615\nI did this for\n\n304\n00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:02.713\nthe purposes of me being able to tell\nwhat the heck it is that I'm doing.\n\n305\n00:15:02.713 --> 00:15:06.397\nI'm gonna do A+ here and\nI'll call this, I'll tell you what,\n\n306\n00:15:06.397 --> 00:15:08.300\nwe'll do a mirror on this one.\n\n307\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.203\nRAIDed, I don't know what RAIDed is.\n\n308\n00:15:09.203 --> 00:15:11.970\nThat's our own standard here, right?\n\n309\n00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.110\nAnd that's part of it, right?\n\n310\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.170\nAnd then what we'll do is we'll\njust kinda enter that in.\n\n311\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.352\nIt's gonna ask us what\nRAID level do you want?\n\n312\n00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:20.544\nNotice that it says,\nwe got the option to do,\n\n313\n00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:23.976\nI'll tell you we'll just keep it\nRAID level 0 for consistency here.\n\n314\n00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:28.763\nAnd then it gives me the ability to select\nall the disks that are in the system,\n\n315\n00:15:28.763 --> 00:15:29.730\nif I wanted to.\n\n316\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.450\nIn this case, we only have two,\nnotice that I really don't have an option.\n\n317\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.804\nStripe size, there's always some debate\nof what stripe size should it be.\n\n318\n00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:44.300\nI'm just gonna ahead and\nleave the 128k block size, if you will.\n\n319\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.110\nNotice that it gives the capacity there,\nI'm not really gonna change the capacity.\n\n320\n00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.627\nThere's not really much that I can\ndo here, because it is a stripe.\n\n321\n00:15:50.627 --> 00:15:54.000\nIt's gonna total up all\nof the drive capacity.\n\n322\n00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.275\nWe'll go ahead and\njust say enter here, and\n\n323\n00:15:56.275 --> 00:15:59.055\nthen it's gonna ask me do I\nwant to create the volume.\n\n324\n00:15:59.055 --> 00:16:02.699\nNotice that in creating the volume\nit's letting you know that, hey,\n\n325\n00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:06.460\nif you had any information on this before,\nit's gonna be gone.\n\n326\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.430\nAnd there's really nothing you\nwill be able to do about that.\n\n327\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:16.810\nNow, the next thing I wanna kinda move\nonto is that if you are going to now,\n\n328\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.800\nyou just created this RAID array,\n\n329\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.780\nyou're going to have to\nreinstall your operating system.\n\n330\n00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.360\nRemember I was talking\nabout boot sequence?\n\n331\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.330\nWell, we've got a little USB drive here,\n\n332\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.020\nand I'm gonna fly off\nthe cuff on this one.\n\n333\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.260\nI'm gonna hope that it's still\nconfigured the way it was yesterday.\n\n334\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.290\nI'm really not sure.\n\n335\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.260\nBut we're gonna find out.\n\n336\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.190\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's reboot this system here, and\n\n337\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.880\nlet's take a look at the BIOS\nas this thing does reboot here.\n\n338\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.260\nAnd hopefully it's rebooting on us.\n\n339\n00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.240\nWe're gonna boot into the one\ntime boot menu this time.\n\n340\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.800\nAnd I really hope that we see the USB\ndrive here somewhere in the list.\n\n341\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.760\nIt should be initiating that USB drive,\nnotice the configuration utility is there.\n\n342\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.260\nThat's a good thing,\nnow notice we have a couple of options.\n\n343\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.309\nI can't boot to the RAID array right yet.\n\n344\n00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:03.875\nRight, there's no operating system on it,\nso your OS wouldn't be found,\n\n345\n00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:05.640\nit would be a failure to boot.\n\n346\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose the USB drive here.\n\n347\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.350\nAnd hopefully, what we're gonna see is\nthat it's gonna give me the legendary,\n\n348\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.830\npress any key to continue.\n\n349\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.710\nI found the any key, it's on the bottom\nof the keyboard, just kidding, guys.\n\n350\n00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.940\nWe're gonna just boot into\nour Windows operating system.\n\n351\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.920\nAnd what we should see here after a bit,\nis the ability, essentially, to\n\n352\n00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.130\ninstall the operating system and basically\nstart this machine over from scratch.\n\n353\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.260\nNow, understand that in this episode,\n\n354\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.900\nwe're really not going to take you\nthrough the installation process because\n\n355\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.400\nit's a long process here and\nit could take a while.\n\n356\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.550\nWe definitely tackle that on a 902 because\nthey get more under the operating system.\n\n357\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.880\nOne of the last things I just wanna\nkinda mention that are in the list here,\n\n358\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.110\nthey talk about crash screens,\nproprietary crash screens.\n\n359\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:58.030\nWindows has their blue screen of death,\nwe also see for instance, in\n\n360\n00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.470\nthe Mac world they have their little text\nthat happens when there's a blue screen,\n\n361\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.190\nor it's not a blue screen but\nthey call it a kernel panic.\n\n362\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.460\nIt's when you have a system shut down,\nwhen you have a stop error.\n\n363\n00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.310\nSomething happens within the hard drive,\nRAM, CPU, general fault protection\n\n364\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.680\nhappens and essentially it shuts\neverything down and the computer reboots.\n\n365\n00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.750\nHowever you also have\ninside of the Mac world,\n\n366\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.380\nyou have what's known as the pin wheel.\n\n367\n00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.450\nAnd the pin wheel can be when\nslow performance happens.\n\n368\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.840\nI know Dan and I have struggled on and\noff sometimes with our Macs here where\n\n369\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.550\nwe're running something and\nit takes a while, right?\n\n370\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.540\nIn Windows, you get the spinning Cheerio,\n\n371\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.330\nI call it the blue Cheerio that\nsits there and just kind of spins.\n\n372\n00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.820\nIt used to be in the old days it would\nbe a little hourglass, I believe,\n\n373\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.760\nthat would rotate.\n\n374\n00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.130\nI'm not exactly sure what\nit did because Linux has so\n\n375\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.260\nmany different types of cool\ngraphical user interfaces.\n\n376\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.120\nI'm sure it's probably slightly\ndifferent in each one, right?\n\n377\n00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.310\nSo you do have those, keep in mind\nthe proprietary crash screens,\n\n378\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.800\nas well as the BSOD, that's\nthe acronym for blue screen of death.\n\n379\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.410\nAnd again that is a stop error as\nwell as they call it a kernel panic,\n\n380\n00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.890\nthat's a more generic term every\nsingle system has to have it.\n\n381\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.110\nNow, they do call out one tool that I've\nnoticed that I haven't mentioned here,\n\n382\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.800\nand I do wanna kinda talk about it,\njust real briefly.\n\n383\n00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.430\nThey call that screwdrivers.\n\n384\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.140\nOne of the things you'll notice when\nwe were looking at these machines, not\n\n385\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.530\na single machine that we've showed you in\nthis episode needs a screwdriver, right?\n\n386\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.140\nYou might need one, but more so the day\nthat what you're seeing are drive sleds.\n\n387\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.576\nRight, you have these rails\nthat attach to the drive, and\n\n388\n00:19:23.576 --> 00:19:25.525\nyou basically they're tool-less, right?\n\n389\n00:19:25.525 --> 00:19:29.480\nYou could slide the drives in the bay and\nthey lock in place.\n\n390\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.240\nAnd if you need to take the drives\nout you just pinch them and\n\n391\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.600\npull the drive right out of its bay.\n\n392\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.040\nThat is more common today, it makes\nit tool-less it makes it very easy.\n\n393\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.960\nAbout the only thing you\nreally need a tool for\n\n394\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.860\nanymore Dan is removing the motherboards,\nright?\n\n395\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.489\nBecause they have to be bolted down cuz\nyou don't want vibration and certainly you\n\n396\n00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:50.030\ndon't want them making a contact, if you\nwill, to any electrical component because\n\n397\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.390\nof the traces on them could basically\nelectrically arc out the system.\n\n398\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:59.050\nSo, I know guys and gals, this is has\nbeen a long journey here, but hopefully\n\n399\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.300\nwe've given you some of the ideas and\nreally the hands-on on some of the things\n\n400\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.340\nyou can see inside of troubleshooting your\nhard drives as well as your RAID arrays.\n\n401\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n402\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.250\nThanks for walking us down that road,\nand holding our little hands so\n\n403\n00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.860\nthat we don't feel like lost\nlittle lambs in the woods.\n\n404\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.260\nBut, like you said,\nwe are at the end of that episode.\n\n405\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.320\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n406\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.530\nSigning off, for ITProTV.\n\n407\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.830\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n408\n00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n409\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.261\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n410\n00:20:21.261 -->

00:00:12.374\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:14.181\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.480\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.374\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on our\n\n7\n00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:24.440\nA Plus series,\nthe good old 901 or 220, 901.\n\n8\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.300\nGotta get the numbers in\nthe right spot there.\n\n9\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.040\nJoining us in the studio yet again,\nthe Linux expertise on that topic,\n\n10\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.160\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.568\nWes, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.225\nAnd Dan, I gotta give you props again and\nas always with all these different exam\n\n14\n00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:40.264\nnumbers that you jump in and\nhost, you´re doing pretty good.\n\n15\n00:00:40.264 --> 00:00:41.982\n&gt;&gt; Forget the Microsoft stuff\ncuz that´s insane [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:43.021\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] literally.\n\n17\n00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.106\nSo that´s right, well, you heard what\nDan said, we´re doing CompTIAs one, two,\n\n18\n00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.483\nthree, four, five, six.\n\n19\n00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:49.883\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or better known as 220-901.\n\n20\n00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.330\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That would be awesome.\n\n21\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.050\n&gt;&gt; And we´re going to be looking at\na little bit more troubleshooting here.\n\n22\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.780\nWe´ve gone through some different\ntroubleshooting of things like hardware,\n\n23\n00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720\nthings like networks, if you will.\n\n24\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.330\nEven talk briefly about troubleshooting\nin mobile devices, right?\n\n25\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.790\nWe're gonna be looking at some\nof the video projector and\n\n26\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.160\ndisplay issues that you could see.\n\n27\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.263\nSo this might be a little\nbit shorter of an episode.\n\n28\n00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:15.024\nAnd what I mean by that are there's\nsome things that are pretty standard and\n\n29\n00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:19.201\ncommon across all these different issues\nthat they call out right in the objectives\n\n30\n00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:19.870\nfor 901.\n\n31\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.730\nBut let's go ahead and\nwithout further ado let's dive right in.\n\n32\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.045\nSo one of the things\nthat I wanna talk about,\n\n33\n00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:30.313\nthe very first common symptoms that they\nmention is something known as VGA mode.\n\n34\n00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:34.665\nAll right now, VGA mode, we're gonna see\nit in action a little bit more in 902\n\n35\n00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:36.850\nwhen we dive into our operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.630\nAnd I wanna let you know that\nit is inside of Windows.\n\n37\n00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.900\nIt is called,\nI think they call it VGA Mode, but today\n\n38\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.240\nthey really call it low resolution mode\nbecause when you say VGA some people don't\n\n39\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.260\neven know what VGA is anymore in a high\ndefinition society that we are today so.\n\n40\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.260\nI agree with Microsoft's renaming on this.\n\n41\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.170\nSometimes Microsoft will rename a product\nand they'll release it as a new technology\n\n42\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.420\nwhen it's really the same technology\nwith a new coat of paint,\n\n43\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.200\nhowever I understand why they've\ndone that right VGA mode.\n\n44\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.430\nMany people probably don't even know\nwhat the Video Graphics Array is.\n\n45\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.550\nIn fact it's kind of interesting.\n\n46\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.580\nI was looking at feed that or\n\n47\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.900\nsomething that come across\nmy news feed earlier today.\n\n48\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.551\nThey were talking about the old\nAtari 520 ST computer, and\n\n49\n00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:25.902\nit was an advertisement for it when it\ncame out in 1990 or 1985 I think it was,\n\n50\n00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:30.476\nand it said your new monochrome display,\n640 by 480.\n\n51\n00:02:30.476 --> 00:02:32.530\nExtremely sharp resolution.\n\n52\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.220\nThat is actually the GA mode, right?\n\n53\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.440\nThat is your videographics array, right?\n\n54\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.290\nIt is the 640 by 480 resolution.\n\n55\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.360\nSo, again what you'll see is when you're\ntrouble shooting inside of the operating\n\n56\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.450\nsystem and\nwhen we get into our operating systems,\n\n57\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.140\nwe'll definitely show you\na little bit more about this.\n\n58\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.910\nYou'll see that it has been renamed\nlow resolution mode, right.\n\n59\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.770\nBecause understand right away that if\nI'm having a problem with my monitor,\n\n60\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.790\nI understand what low resolution is but\n\n61\n00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.370\nI might not really understand\nwhat the heck VGA is, okay.\n\n62\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.100\nSo VGA mode is still what they\ncall it out on the exam objective.\n\n63\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.780\nSo let's see if we can clarify\nthis a little bit, all right.\n\n64\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.590\nSo what is VGA mode?\n\n65\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.530\nWhat you need to understand, all right\nis a little bit more about how Windows,\n\n66\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.590\nthis is more of a Windows\nthing if you will.\n\n67\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.870\nHow windows when it boots in, and it\nstarts to take control over the hardware.\n\n68\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.290\nWhat its going to do, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.150\nSo when we go through post,\nwe go through BIOS right?\n\n70\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.298\nWe have our basic input-output system.\n\n71\n00:03:29.298 --> 00:03:33.470\nAnd whether you're using the BIOS or\nusing UEFI right, we look for\n\n72\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.140\nsome boot code, and the boot code is\nwhat bootstraps the operating system and\n\n73\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.760\nthen hands over the hardware\nto the operating system right?\n\n74\n00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.750\nEvery machine does this that\nisn't Windows specific.\n\n75\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.180\nHowever, here is where a little\nbit more specifics come in to it.\n\n76\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.580\nWhen Windows goes to basically\ntake over the video card and\n\n77\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.540\nI guess this could be a Linux thing\nit could be a Mac thing as well.\n\n78\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.938\nYou have a driver within the operating\nsystem that's gonna load and\n\n79\n00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:04.765\nits going to allow the operating system\nto communicate with the video card.\n\n80\n00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:09.230\nNow, I should clarify that\nthat's every operating system.\n\n81\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.506\nHowever, here's something\ninteresting that Windows does,\n\n82\n00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:15.162\nif there's a problem with the driver and\nthe driver\n\n83\n00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:19.442\ncan't allow the communication between\nthe operating system and the video card.\n\n84\n00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:23.158\nThen what Windows does is\nkind of like it's It's own\n\n85\n00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:27.296\nway to not really diagnose itself but\nto keep you booting so\n\n86\n00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:32.785\nthat you can troubleshoot the problem as\nit says let me take a generic driver,\n\n87\n00:04:32.785 --> 00:04:38.131\none that all video cards understand and\nit's not specific to any adapter.\n\n88\n00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:40.113\nAnd I'll allow you boot to that driver,\n\n89\n00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:44.230\nI'll let that driver allow you to\ncommunicate with the graphics card, right?\n\n90\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.030\nSo there's a problem,\n\n91\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.260\nunderstand that's why we call this trouble\nshooting section, there's a problem.\n\n92\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.200\nIt means that Windows cannot communicate\n\n93\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.550\nvia the install driver that's\nspecific to the manufacturer, right?\n\n94\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.860\nRemember, manufacturer drivers allow\nyou the full functionality of whatever\n\n95\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.150\nthe hardware device is, and\nthat again it's not specific to Windows,\n\n96\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.770\ndoesn't matter if you're in a Nix-based\nsystem, Unix, Linux, Mac right.\n\n97\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.040\nYou have manufactured drivers.\n\n98\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.210\nManufactured drivers allow because the\nmanufacturer is the one that's creating\n\n99\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.920\nthose drivers.\n\n100\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.360\nAllow you the full functionality.\n\n101\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.680\nHowever, if you install a driver in\nWindows and it becomes problematic.\n\n102\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.736\nWhich if you've been around\nany Windows machine.\n\n103\n00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.510\nIt's a commonality [LAUGH] right.\n\n104\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.954\nHow do I diagnosis something if I can't\ninteract with the operating system?\n\n105\n00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:29.940\n&gt;&gt; So Wes would you say this\nis a very good alternative?\n\n106\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.860\n&gt;&gt; I would say its\nan alternative in Windows, why?\n\n107\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.592\nBecause Linux if you can't interact\nwith a GUI, most people don't care.\n\n108\n00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:39.650\nIn fact I know Dan you're one of these.\n\n109\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.630\nThat says, hey if I'm in a server,\nI don't want a GUI, right?\n\n110\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.690\nI don't want all the problems\nthat those drivers can give.\n\n111\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.070\nJust give me the command line,\nthat's my territory anyways.\n\n112\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.060\nWindows, unfortunately, we don't\nhave a lot of those power users, and\n\n113\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.190\nthey need a graphical user interface.\n\n114\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.480\nI just happen to be one of them, right?\n\n115\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.631\nI'm a lot more familiar with a graphical\nuser interface than I am any kind\n\n116\n00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.797\nof terminal right?\n\n117\n00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:01.793\n&gt;&gt; Lightweight.\n\n118\n00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:02.485\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n&gt;&gt; Lightweight.\n\n119\n00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:03.709\n&gt;&gt; I know right.\n\n120\n00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:04.519\n&gt;&gt; Come on son.\n\n121\n00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:07.820\n&gt;&gt; I've got my training wheels on for\nsure, right?\n\n122\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.110\nTraining wheel administration 101.\n\n123\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.850\nSo, this at least gives you the ability.\n\n124\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.692\nIf they say, you know what,\nwe're going to give a generic driver.\n\n125\n00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:19.224\nJust common generic VGA\ndriver allows any video card,\n\n126\n00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:23.753\nprovided it's not the video card,\nlet's be a little more specific,\n\n127\n00:06:23.753 --> 00:06:29.049\nbecause if it boots into VGA mode and you\nstill don't get anything on the monitor,\n\n128\n00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:31.551\nchances are the video card's fried.\n\n129\n00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:36.876\nThere's something maybe it needs to be\nreseated, maybe the GPU's overheated,\n\n130\n00:06:36.876 --> 00:06:40.886\nthe memory's gone, but\nthe point being is now I can at least,\n\n131\n00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:46.100\nin a very low resolution environment\nuninstall the problematic driver.\n\n132\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.020\nMaybe I've got a thumb drive and\nI plug in the thumb drive and I install\n\n133\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.750\na non-corrupted or updated driver, or\nthe correct driver for that matter.\n\n134\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.520\nSo understand,\n\n135\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.320\nlow resolution mode according to\nthe objective is also called VGA mode.\n\n136\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.300\nUnderstand there's really no difference.\n\n137\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.930\nAnd the reason I say this is because as\nyou will see, one of the things I really\n\n138\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.090\nlike about CompTIA's A+ is they\ngot out of just requiring Windows.\n\n139\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.010\nAnd they want you to know\na little bit about Linux.\n\n140\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.880\nThey want you to know\na little bit about Mac.\n\n141\n00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.760\nAnd in all honesty you should,\nif you're going to be a tech,\n\n142\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.120\nbecause not every body's going to bring\nyou just a Window's device right?\n\n143\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.240\nHowever, know that all right?\n\n144\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.180\nNow the next thing that we get\ninto is no image on the screen.\n\n145\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.540\nNow let's step back.\n\n146\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.580\nOne of the things that we've talked about\nin troubleshooting for the purposes of\n\n147\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.360\nthis exam and really in real life,\nwe've always stressed simple fixes first.\n\n148\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.653\nWhen it comes to your monitor,\n\n149\n00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:45.582\nfirst thing I want you to do is pay\nattention to the light on the monitor.\n\n150\n00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:48.072\n&gt;&gt; Completely rebuild the graphics\ncard from the ground up.\n\n151\n00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:49.023\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n152\n00:07:49.023 --> 00:07:51.411\nKnow the inner workings,\nhave the schematics, have the drivers.\n\n153\n00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.861\n&gt;&gt; That would be the Ronnie Wong,\nstarting position [CROSSTALK].\n\n154\n00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:56.708\n&gt;&gt; That's right, he's like,\nI'll tell the IEEE what to do [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:58.968\nRight, electrical engineering, right?\n\n156\n00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:03.745\nJoking aside, though, pay attention\nto what the monitor light is doing.\n\n157\n00:08:03.745 --> 00:08:04.680\nRight, what do I mean by that?\n\n158\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.260\nWell, you have a few different\ncolors that are potential, right?\n\n159\n00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.100\nAnd I'll mention the most common ones.\n\n160\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.710\nGreen and blue and\nsometimes monitor manufacturers,\n\n161\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.510\ndisplay manufacturers will use a blue\nlight or they'll use a green light, right?\n\n162\n00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.261\nAnd either one of those\ntypically mean power, right?\n\n163\n00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.650\nYou've got power to the monitor.\n\n164\n00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.900\nWhat is another one that's kind\nof consistent is an amber light.\n\n165\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.216\nAnd you can say orange and amber.\n\n166\n00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:32.781\nI got in the habit of saying amber and the\nreason I say that because the first time I\n\n167\n00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:37.211\nsaw a question across the A + exam,\nI didn't know what the color amber was and\n\n168\n00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:42.010\nI'd never apparently paid attention to\nJurassic Park and the little fly in amber.\n\n169\n00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.740\nNow I know and that's why I use that term.\n\n170\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.069\nSo they could say orange, they could say\namber so just understand that when you see\n\n171\n00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:52.905\nan amber light there's a few\nthings that can happen.\n\n172\n00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:57.647\nThat's the big, big thing to keep in mind\non the exam right, pay attention to what\n\n173\n00:08:57.647 --> 00:09:01.936\nthey are giving you in context of\nthe question the light is doing, right?\n\n174\n00:09:01.936 --> 00:09:04.168\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's get a little bit more pacific,\n\n175\n00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:06.053\nas a friend of mine would say,\nspecific, right?\n\n176\n00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:07.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pacific.\n\n177\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.478\n&gt;&gt; Pay attention to the power\nindicator light, all right?\n\n178\n00:09:09.478 --> 00:09:10.334\nIf it's green or\n\n179\n00:09:10.334 --> 00:09:15.590\na blue light, then it typically means that\nthe monitor is receiving power, all right?\n\n180\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.290\nBut what if you have no\nimage on the screen and\n\n181\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.279\nyou've got a green or blue light?\n\n182\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.785\nWell, here's another thing that\nI want you to pay attention to,\n\n183\n00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:22.810\nsomething known as an OSD.\n\n184\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.581\nYes, we're never shy of acronyms\nhere at the A+ level, right?\n\n185\n00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:28.300\nThe onscreen display.\n\n186\n00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.550\nAnd what I mean by that is if you have a\nlittle display that's kinda just traveling\n\n187\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.866\nacross your monitor in electrical limbo,\nlooks like it doesn't know where it's\n\n188\n00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:39.757\ngoing, and\nthat means that the monitor's just fine.\n\n189\n00:09:39.757 --> 00:09:43.518\nThe on screen display says the monitor and\nme the monitor,\n\n190\n00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:45.753\nI'm doing what I should, right?\n\n191\n00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:50.078\n&gt;&gt; And the good thing is, typically they\nsay something like, no input detected.\n\n192\n00:09:50.078 --> 00:09:52.920\nThey try to be a little informational and\nnot just go hi,\n\n193\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.590\nthis is a bouncing ball\nrunning across your screen.\n\n194\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.520\nThey're saying, I don't detect that\nthere's anything coming toward me that I\n\n195\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.315\nshould be displaying, so\nI'm just gonna give you this.\n\n196\n00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:05.214\n&gt;&gt; And that is a great\nprogression of the technology.\n\n197\n00:10:05.214 --> 00:10:07.947\nCuz you're absolutely right Dan, and\nsometimes they get real specific.\n\n198\n00:10:07.947 --> 00:10:09.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No DVI connection in to detect it.\n\n199\n00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:10.722\n&gt;&gt; Foul, yeah.\n\n200\n00:10:10.722 --> 00:10:13.786\n&gt;&gt; It's like, wow, you even told\nme what the interface was, right?\n\n201\n00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:15.706\nAnd that is exactly right.\n\n202\n00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:20.068\nAll right, so if you get a green light and\nthen, here's another one, though,\n\n203\n00:10:20.068 --> 00:10:24.171\nin fact, a lot of our monitors that\nwe've had around the ITProTV here say,\n\n204\n00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:27.710\ngoing into low power mode,\npower saving mode, right?\n\n205\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.140\nBecause they don't want to burn\nany image into the screen, right?\n\n206\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.830\nYou might say, well,\n\n207\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.040\nwe don't really have to worry about too\nmuch more about those burned in images.\n\n208\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.540\nNot for the most part, but if you leave\none static image on any display for too\n\n209\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.540\nlong and its gonna leave trace remnants\nof that cuz it's a lit pixel, right.\n\n210\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.930\nSo pay attention to that because if\nthere's no image on the screen and\n\n211\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.550\nyou have a green or a blue light\nthat indicates the power's there,\n\n212\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.380\nconnections, connections,\nand connections right?\n\n213\n00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.600\nYou could have a loose connection from\nthe monitor to the video adapter.\n\n214\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.280\nOr it could be the back\nof the motherboard,\n\n215\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.630\nif you have an integrated video card,\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.670\nIt could be the motherboard itself\non the backside of the computer.\n\n217\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.430\nAll right, if you have a green light and\nor a blue light and\n\n218\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:17.750\nthere's still no image on the screen, well\nthat could be a video card that's failed.\n\n219\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.580\nIt could be the cable itself.\n\n220\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.750\nHere's one of the things\nthat cables kinda do.\n\n221\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.638\nCables kind of,\nif you have a damaged cable,\n\n222\n00:11:24.638 --> 00:11:28.522\nyou typically will get some kind\nof distortion in the image.\n\n223\n00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:31.597\nIt could be the fact that the colors\naren't being produced correctly.\n\n224\n00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:34.050\nRight, the colors could be\na little bit off, right?\n\n225\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.010\nThat doesn't happen quite as much anymore.\n\n226\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.324\nIt used to happen very, very common in VGA\nconnections that we're gonna see our team\n\n227\n00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:43.021\nmonitors, a little bent\npin in the VGA connection.\n\n228\n00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:46.075\nAnd I guess still today,\na VGA connection of the bent pin.\n\n229\n00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:50.332\nRight, you'll have one of the, like a\ngreen hue, or a red or a blue hue, right,\n\n230\n00:11:50.332 --> 00:11:52.292\nthat'll be across the screen here.\n\n231\n00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:54.755\nAnd so that can happen too.\n\n232\n00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:57.226\nIt could be a damaged video card as well.\n\n233\n00:11:57.226 --> 00:12:00.771\nAll right, keep in mind it's not\nreally likely that it's gonna be\n\n234\n00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:03.630\na driver issue cuz we've\nalready kind of mentioned.\n\n235\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.830\nWell, at least in Windows.\n\n236\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.239\nBecause we've mentioned VGA mode.\n\n237\n00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:08.119\nYou'd boot right into VGA mode.\n\n238\n00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:11.845\nWindows would still continue\nto load a generic VGA driver.\n\n239\n00:12:11.845 --> 00:12:15.841\nAll right so power issues with the\nmonitor, right, if you have an amber or\n\n240\n00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:18.742\norange connection, or\nexcuse me light now we've got\n\n241\n00:12:18.742 --> 00:12:22.610\na chance that there is some kind of\npower issue with the monitor itself,\n\n242\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.341\ncould be a power issue with the computer,\nright?\n\n243\n00:12:25.341 --> 00:12:28.945\nIt could be zero connection,\njust like that more advanced OC,\n\n244\n00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:33.705\nI'm going to say OCD again, OSD here, the\nadvanced on screen display message that\n\n245\n00:12:33.705 --> 00:12:37.450\nDan was mentioning that says hey,\nnot detecting a connection.\n\n246\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.730\nIt goes into a power saving mode and\nthen the light goes from a green or\n\n247\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.600\na blue over to that amber light, right?\n\n248\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.900\nAnd it does that for\nprotecting it from a burned in image.\n\n249\n00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.216\nAll right,\ncould be power issues with the AC source,\n\n250\n00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:54.583\nnever overlook the rat tail, right?\n\n251\n00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:57.110\n[LAUGH] I don't know if you've done this,\nDan,\n\n252\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.153\nI've got Ronald McDonald sized feet\nhere and I'll stretch out at my desk and\n\n253\n00:13:01.153 --> 00:13:05.195\nif I've got one of those little power\nstrips I accidentally kick the power on\n\n254\n00:13:05.195 --> 00:13:08.700\noff switch and turn off everything\nthat's connected to my desk.\n\n255\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.739\nRight, so that can be.\n\n256\n00:13:09.739 --> 00:13:13.409\nAnd again, you're probably saying, well,\nWes, Dan, this is very simplistic.\n\n257\n00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:14.131\nYes, it is.\n\n258\n00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:17.740\n&gt;&gt; That's because 90% of the time,\nthis is what's causing the problems.\n\n259\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.673\nWhy beat yourself up trying to figure out\nsome complex issue when it was just that\n\n260\n00:13:21.673 --> 00:13:24.445\nthe power strip was turned off,\nright, start simple.\n\n261\n00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:27.608\n&gt;&gt; Don't go into electrical engineering\nwhen all you have to do is plug in\n\n262\n00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:29.980\na cable, yeah,\ngreat great piece of advice there.\n\n263\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.790\nCould be cable issues like I said,\ncould be a setting on the monitor.\n\n264\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.090\nRight we have, now here's something\nthat's really cool about the monitors.\n\n265\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.470\nNot only can they get advanced\ndisplay messages like that but\n\n266\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.700\nthey can also do an auto switching.\n\n267\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.540\nI can see, I don't see anything\non the DVI connection,\n\n268\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.960\nI don't see anything on the display\nport connection but you know what?\n\n269\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.440\nI just detected something coming over\nDisplayPort so let me go ahead and\n\n270\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.060\nswitch it over to display\nport automatically for you.\n\n271\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.260\nGuess what?\n\n272\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.360\nEvery one of the monitors that\nour hosts use don't do that.\n\n273\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.660\nYou have to manually switch it over,\nright?\n\n274\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.740\nIt'll say, I'm not detecting anything on\nHDMI1 and if you lift up the monitor and\n\n275\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.860\nlook at the bottom of it,\nyou're plugged into HDMI2, right?\n\n276\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.730\nAnd it doesn't automatically\nswitch it over.\n\n277\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.980\nSo it could be just a configuration on the\nmonitor as well that could be doing this.\n\n278\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.720\nHere's the other thing.\n\n279\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.140\nHow about let's go to\nthe computer side and\n\n280\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.610\ntalk about the operating system for\na second?\n\n281\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.990\nIf you have like for instance in Windows,\n\n282\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:27.350\nif you have one of your power options,\nthat is the power saving option.\n\n283\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.200\nIf you've got a screen saver, that's been\nturned on for a little bit and then after\n\n284\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.320\nawhile you're still not using it,\ncould completely power down the system.\n\n285\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.560\nThe system could go into a standby state.\n\n286\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.020\nNow in Windows it's called sleep.\n\n287\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.685\nIt doesn't matter, right,\nindustry wide standards if you have Linux,\n\n288\n00:14:42.685 --> 00:14:44.884\nif you have MAC, it's a low powered state.\n\n289\n00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.883\nAnd we'll talk more about some of\nthose power states when we get\n\n290\n00:14:48.883 --> 00:14:51.227\ninto our operating system section.\n\n291\n00:14:51.227 --> 00:14:54.430\nVideo card, I guess I could say, like\nI said, the video card is bad as well.\n\n292\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.903\nNow, here's another one.\n\n293\n00:14:56.903 --> 00:15:00.350\nOverheat and shutdown, all right.\n\n294\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.311\nThis can happen when\nthe monitor itself is failing.\n\n295\n00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:08.046\nThe other thing that could be happening\nhere is that you have a dust vent,\n\n296\n00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:10.557\nwhich you have on the back\nof these monitors, and\n\n297\n00:15:10.557 --> 00:15:14.356\nif you're not paying attention to\nthe environment that you have them in,\n\n298\n00:15:14.356 --> 00:15:17.940\nthey get dusty enough that when\nthey come on, they could overheat.\n\n299\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.488\nNow that's not quite as common today.\n\n300\n00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.580\nDefinitely the CRTs,\nbecause the CRT is very power hungry.\n\n301\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.678\nPlasma monitors require a lot of power and\na lot of power means a lot of heat.\n\n302\n00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.868\nLED screens, very low power.\n\n303\n00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:32.769\nLCD screens, maybe.\n\n304\n00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:34.010\nThat could happen,\n\n305\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.181\nthat can happen when the cold\ncathode fluorescent lamps overheat.\n\n306\n00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:41.704\nThat could cause a problem but\nnot so much with the LEDs.\n\n307\n00:15:41.704 --> 00:15:45.490\nWell, almost non-existent in the LEDs,\nif you will.\n\n308\n00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.810\nAll right, so excessive heat, and\nagain, remember in the position, right?\n\n309\n00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.210\nSo the location of the monitor,\nif it's in direct sunlight,\n\n310\n00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.661\nyou could be cooking your monitor.\n\n311\n00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.673\nNow well,\nwhere would you say that this happens?\n\n312\n00:15:55.673 --> 00:15:58.990\nWes, I'm not sitting in my office outside,\nright, in the sun.\n\n313\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.586\nNo, you're not.\n\n314\n00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:03.628\nBut if you're sitting at a window and\nnoontime comes up, especially in Florida,\n\n315\n00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:07.611\nand that light is shining directly through\nthat window onto that monitor It could\n\n316\n00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:11.361\nraise the ambient temperature on the\noutside of the monitor and start to cook\n\n317\n00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:15.370\nthe plastics a little bit which also will\nheat up the monitor internally as well.\n\n318\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.580\nInternal cooling system.\n\n319\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.990\nIf one this is optional I just\nkind of if applicable if you\n\n320\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.630\nhave some kind of internal cooling system\nit could be the fact that it has failed.\n\n321\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.540\nA lot of these again, especially with LEDs\nyou really do not have to worry about.\n\n322\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.190\nIt could be a defective monitor.\n\n323\n00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.390\nIf it's overheating and\nshutting down like that, for any reason.\n\n324\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.460\nChances are it could be that\njust the fact that the monitor,\n\n325\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.640\nnow what I didn't mention and probably\nshould have mentioned, a projector.\n\n326\n00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.790\nProjectors have lamps in them.\n\n327\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.630\nAnd yes they can overheat and\nyes they can go into thermal shutdown.\n\n328\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.610\nOne of the companies that I had had a\nprojector that worked with an interactive\n\n329\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.770\nwhite board.\n\n330\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.180\nAnd they had filters on them.\n\n331\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.970\nAnd part of my job as a tech is to\nwalk through the classrooms and\n\n332\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.760\npull these filters out and\nclean the filters, right?\n\n333\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.360\nNow what it is it had what I call\nthe ID10T display message that said hey\n\n334\n00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.550\nit's been so many hundreds of hours,\nyou need to clean the filters.\n\n335\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.010\nThe other fact is that the bulbs,\n\n336\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.560\nthe lamps themselves some\nof them are very expensive.\n\n337\n00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.040\nI've seen some of\nthe lamps that were four or\n\n338\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.790\nfive hundred dollars just for\na single lamp.\n\n339\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.970\nThat's like spending four or five\nhundred dollars for a light bulb, right?\n\n340\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.330\nAnd because of that sometimes,\nsome companies want to extend and\n\n341\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:29.960\njust try to stretch the boundaries.\n\n342\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.880\nAnd you can't blame '.\n\n343\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.300\nWith the price of '.\n\n344\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.890\nSo it can be the lamp has failed too.\n\n345\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.879\n&gt;&gt; Cheap skates [LAUGH].\n\n346\n00:17:35.879 --> 00:17:37.970\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH] and\nit could be defective.\n\n347\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.200\n&gt;&gt; That's a real thing,\nI mean 4 or 5 hundred dollars for\n\n348\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.270\nwhat basically amounts to a glorified\nlightbulb is a tough thing to swallow.\n\n349\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.730\nAnd if you've got multiple\nof these devices,\n\n350\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.550\nyou are gonna want to try to extend\nthe life out as far as you can.\n\n351\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.870\nNow if it's a missing critical thing,\nyou're gonna wanna have spares around so\n\n352\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.100\nthat if they do go bad,\nyou can immediately replace them.\n\n353\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.310\nBut yeah, it's just part of the game.\n\n354\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Well we've talked about in other\nepisodes being proactive with your CMOS\n\n355\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.700\nbatteries.\n\n356\n00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.840\nWell if I can get 40 CMOS batteries and\nI didn't pay 10 bucks for them,\n\n357\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.170\nyeah we'll keep some on backup.\n\n358\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.830\nBut like you said, if you're trying to\nbe proactive with it do you really wanna\n\n359\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.170\nspend $500 to keep a light bulb in the\nback that you might not use for a year.\n\n360\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Again, if you're a project\n\n361\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.030\nmanager of some type.\n\n362\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.940\nIf you're a manager of any sorts and\nyou're looking at your bottom line,\n\n363\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.080\nyou might say well you know what,\n\n364\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.000\nwe'll just go ahead and\novernight that tomorrow if that happens.\n\n365\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.460\nAnd again,\nit's really contingent on the company.\n\n366\n00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.670\nAll right.\nSome of the other things that we just have\n\n367\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.540\nto kind of talk about.\n\n368\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.050\nAnd I'm gonna add something, and\nyou're like Wes please don't add any more.\n\n369\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.320\nWe've already got enough to worry about,\nbut they talk about dead pixels.\n\n370\n00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.830\nBut one of the things that they don't\nmention, I also want to talk about,\n\n371\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.800\nis a stuck pixel.\n\n372\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.530\nIt's not in the objectives,\nbut I want to talk about it,\n\n373\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.160\nsince we're here with\ntalking about pixels at all.\n\n374\n00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.180\nSo what's the difference?\n\n375\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.850\nWell, a dead pixel is\none that you cannot fix.\n\n376\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.890\nDead pixel is gone, all right?\n\n377\n00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.490\nA dead pixel basically is\nwhere the pixel itself\n\n378\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.450\nespecially in thin film transistors.\n\n379\n00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.810\nLet's understand that.\n\n380\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.580\nIn the older passive matrix, what you\nwould end up having is columns of these\n\n381\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.700\npixels that would be illuminated with the\ntransistor a little metal conductor and\n\n382\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.200\nthen what happened when adjacent columns\nwould rely on the ambient lighting.\n\n383\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.700\nThat's what I call\na passive matrix strain.\n\n384\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.040\nIn the active matrix strains that we have\ntoday using TFT thin film transistors,\n\n385\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.320\nevery individual pixel\nhas its own transistor.\n\n386\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.840\nIn the olden days, what would happen\nis if one of those conductors or\n\n387\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.950\na pixel went bad and the series that has\nthe conductor through it, guess what?\n\n388\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.280\nYou get a line right\ndown through the screen.\n\n389\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.980\nToday, a single pixel, you're not gonna be\nable to fix it because of the TFT screen,\n\n390\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.590\nthat pixel has its own transistor and\nthe transistor has failed.\n\n391\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.870\nSo there's just really nothing\nthat you can do for it.\n\n392\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.120\nNow, leads me to my next thought\nthat kind of bled over there.\n\n393\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.130\nHow can you see this?\n\n394\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:58.570\nOne of the easiest ways to see\nthis is to bring up a white image,\n\n395\n00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.420\nand I mean white from corner to corner.\n\n396\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.610\nAnd you'll notice, somewhere in that\nscreen, you'll notice a black mark.\n\n397\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.050\nIt'll just be,\nthere will be no light present.\n\n398\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.070\nAgain, there's nothing you can do.\n\n399\n00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.370\nIt could be a defective monitor.\n\n400\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.610\nThere's been times where\nI've had deployments there.\n\n401\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.870\nIn fact, we've done this here\nat the IT PRO TV studios.\n\n402\n00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.990\nWhere we've received 12, 13, 14, I don't\nknow why it would be an off number there.\n\n403\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.050\nWe'd get a whole bunch of these monitors.\n\n404\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.350\nAnd guess what sometimes shipping they\nget damaged and they're made by humans.\n\n405\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.590\nAnd sometimes they might be made on Friday\nand the humans wanna go home a little\n\n406\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.460\nearly right so\nit might be a defective monitor as well.\n\n407\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.130\nAll right so that's one of the easiest\nways to see it you know to view\n\n408\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.860\na completely white image and\nlike I said corner to corner.\n\n409\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.710\nNow what's the different between that and\na stuck pixel?\n\n410\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.233\nA stuck pixel is not necessarily\none that's failing and\n\n411\n00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:57.170\nit certainly is not one\nthat is necessarily dead.\n\n412\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.560\nA stuck pixel is one that you\nilluminates the color and\n\n413\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.890\nwhen you transition to another image.\n\n414\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.930\nIt has like a memory retention.\n\n415\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:10.800\nIt retains the color illumination of\nthe previous image that it was displaying.\n\n416\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.060\nNow there's a lot of software out\nthere that's really good for helping.\n\n417\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.420\nSo what it does is it sits there and\nit goes to every single pixel and\n\n418\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.130\nyou'll see it warning if\nyou've got epileptic seizures.\n\n419\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.667\nOr you shouldn't be looking\nat fast moving video games.\n\n420\n00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:28.635\nThis is not the kind of software\nthat you wanna be staring at.\n\n421\n00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:30.660\nIt sounds like I'm joking but I'm serious.\n\n422\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.395\nBe careful right.\n\n423\n00:21:31.395 --> 00:21:32.440\n[LAUGH] Because what it's gonna do.\n\n424\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.860\nIt's gonna write different colors,\n\n425\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.585\nRGB to every single entire pixel\nwithin the entirety of the monitor.\n\n426\n00:21:38.585 --> 00:21:40.780\nTrying to kind of wake it up if you will.\n\n427\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.920\nTrying to get it past\nthat stuck resolution.\n\n428\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.040\nHere's another thing that you can do.\n\n429\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:54.500\nWhat you can do is you can take\na little warm, I use a lint free cloth.\n\n430\n00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.842\nAnd just heat it up just ever so slightly.\n\n431\n00:21:56.842 --> 00:21:58.620\nNot hot.\n\n432\n00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.080\nAnd then press it,\nright there on the image,\n\n433\n00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.280\njust press it barely just lightly and\nsometimes that'll work.\n\n434\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.325\nOther people have actually recommended\ntaking a pencil eraser at the end of\n\n435\n00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:09.563\na pencil and\nkinda just massage the pixel a little bit.\n\n436\n00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:10.283\nAnd again,\n\n437\n00:22:10.283 --> 00:22:15.193\nwhat that does is it's gonna kinda get it\na little bit different colors for a bit.\n\n438\n00:22:15.193 --> 00:22:18.106\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; If you've had a rough day at work,\n\n439\n00:22:18.106 --> 00:22:19.570\nyou just wanna massage it.\n\n440\n00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.170\nAnd say, you know,\njust let that melt away.\n\n441\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:21.950\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you're giving.\n\n442\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.910\n&gt;&gt; And come back to working.\n\n443\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.700\n&gt;&gt; You're giving your pixel\na little bit of Fen Shui.\n\n444\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's right.\n\n445\n00:22:25.491 --> 00:22:26.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For sure.\n\n446\n00:22:26.104 --> 00:22:26.908\nFen Shui for your monitor.\n\n447\n00:22:26.908 --> 00:22:27.483\n&gt;&gt; A shiatzu massage.\n\n448\n00:22:27.483 --> 00:22:28.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n449\n00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.610\nSo keep in mind, that's one of\nthe good things is that a stuck pixel,\n\n450\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.010\nthey don't call it out, but you should\nknow about it, because it could happen.\n\n451\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.880\nAll right we've got a few more things\nthat we wanna kinda talk about here.\n\n452\n00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.480\nAnd we got artifacts.\n\n453\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.050\nArtifacts a lot of times can\nbe a video format issue.\n\n454\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.615\nCould be something kinda compression\nissue where you've changed video formats.\n\n455\n00:22:47.615 --> 00:22:51.935\nAnd you get these little strange\nartifacts across the screen.\n\n456\n00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:53.745\nThe video card could overheat.\n\n457\n00:22:53.745 --> 00:22:56.395\nWhen it starts to overheat,\na lot of times GPUs,\n\n458\n00:22:56.395 --> 00:23:00.825\njust like CPUs, will go into a thermal\nshutdown to protect themselves.\n\n459\n00:23:00.825 --> 00:23:04.795\nHowever, sometimes it'll happen where it's\nambient heat, and be careful with this,\n\n460\n00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:10.490\nwhen you have multiple expansion cards\nthat are populated across the motherboard.\n\n461\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.470\nOne card.\n\n462\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.110\nIt's heat that it's exhausted.\n\n463\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.980\nTypically exhausts off\nthe back side of the card.\n\n464\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.580\nIf you have improper air flow,\nyou could be heating the PCB\n\n465\n00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.130\nup on the card that's adjacent to it.\n\n466\n00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.150\nCheck to make sure the GPU fan on\nthe video card is actually working.\n\n467\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.530\nSometimes these get dusty and\nsometimes the bearings seize up on them.\n\n468\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.160\nIt does happen.\n\n469\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.850\nThe other thing with artifacts too is if\nyou've got a PCIE card, a lot of these\n\n470\n00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.160\nPCIE cards, PCIE by itself is so power\nhungry that they needed to put additional\n\n471\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.370\nfour pins within the ATX main power\nconnector just to power the PCIE bus.\n\n472\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.070\nAnd then on top of it, guess what?\n\n473\n00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:55.451\nYou have six and eight pin PCIE connectors\ncome off supply to connect the video card.\n\n474\n00:23:55.451 --> 00:23:57.795\nIf this is improperly seen and\n\n475\n00:23:57.795 --> 00:24:03.248\nyou might not be powering the card\ncorrectly Could be a driver issue.\n\n476\n00:24:03.248 --> 00:24:04.640\nAny time drivers get corrupted,\n\n477\n00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.150\nwe get all kind of things that go\nscrew your haywire in a machine.\n\n478\n00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.130\nCould be an application is expecting\na certain amount of functionality and\n\n479\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.400\nperformance and it doesn't happen.\n\n480\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.810\nYou gamers out there that\nare maybe watching this and\n\n481\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.520\npursuing a certification probably\nknow what it was like a few years ago\n\n482\n00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.800\nif you were to put Crisis\non the highest settings and\n\n483\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.800\nyour graphics card didn't even\nsupport the lowest settings, right?\n\n484\n00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.920\nYou can get these artifacts too.\n\n485\n00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.470\nColor patterns are incorrect, again, this\ncould be where the application itself is\n\n486\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.190\nexpecting a certain level\nof graphics memory,\n\n487\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.930\na certain level of processing\npower within the GPU.\n\n488\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.410\nAnd the poor car just doesn't\nhave those capabilities, right?\n\n489\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.640\nSo that might be something that you\nhave to upgrade the graphics card or\n\n490\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.970\nit could be damaged or defective.\n\n491\n00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.280\nDim image, all right.\n\n492\n00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.180\nDan and I actually mentioned, in fact,\nDanny it was you that mentioned this\n\n493\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.580\nin the laptop episodes that\nwe were doing that dim image.\n\n494\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.400\nBack light inverter could have\nfailed on whatever the device is,\n\n495\n00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.960\ncould be a power setting.\n\n496\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.930\nIt could be like a performance setting,\nif you will.\n\n497\n00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:08.970\nIf you've got it for power saving,\nremember your monitor can go at\n\n498\n00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:14.380\na power saving type situation where it\ndims the image to preserve battery life.\n\n499\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.140\nHowever, could be the fact\nthat the battery or\n\n500\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.250\nthe backlight inverter has failed, right?\n\n501\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.230\nThat's where the temporary workaround\nis to extend the monitor out to a TV,\n\n502\n00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.605\nlike you were mentioning Dan, or\n\n503\n00:25:25.605 --> 00:25:29.390\nout to a third or\nsecond monitor until you can get it fixed.\n\n504\n00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.240\nFlickering image, more often than not,\na flickering image is gonna be a loose\n\n505\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.540\nconnection, be a loose connection on\nyour power or on your cable itself.\n\n506\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.390\nCould be a damaged connection port or\na damaged cable as well.\n\n507\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.940\nDistorted image, again,\ndistorted image could be driver issue,\n\n508\n00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.370\ncould be resolution configuration, right?\n\n509\n00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.850\nDistorted images can happen.\n\n510\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.880\nRemember that LCDs, LEDs, and\nOLEDs have what's known as a fixed or\n\n511\n00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.050\nnative resolution,\nthat's the resolution they operate in.\n\n512\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:04.350\nIf you get a 1920x1200 monitor,\nthat's its fixed resolution.\n\n513\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.680\nWhen you change the resolution, just like\nwe have to do here to our MacBooks so\n\n514\n00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.060\nthat you guys can see it better,\n\n515\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.580\nwe do that because it brings up\nthe size of the icons, right?\n\n516\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.760\nIt can distort the image if you set\nan incorrect monitor resolution, right?\n\n517\n00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.112\nWe've done this before where we've changed\nthe resolutions, we look at it, and we're\n\n518\n00:26:23.112 --> 00:26:26.362\nlike, wow, nobody would have wanna look\nand stare at that for 30 minutes, right?\n\n519\n00:26:26.362 --> 00:26:26.874\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:26:26.874 --> 00:26:28.361\n&gt;&gt; So again, it could be a resolution\n\n521\n00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:30.526\nconfiguration that you\nhave to pay attention to.\n\n522\n00:26:30.526 --> 00:26:33.237\nDistorted images could be driver\n\n523\n00:26:33.237 --> 00:26:36.845\nissues as well.\nDistorted geometry a lot of times that's\n\n524\n00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:41.599\ngonna be an incorrect resolution setting\nas well where you'll notice, for instance,\n\n525\n00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:45.389\nafter you're done watching this or\npause the video, if you change and\n\n526\n00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:48.729\nturn your resolution,\nlike there's a knob on the computer,\n\n527\n00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:52.458\nif you change your resolution and\nthe screen resolution settings and\n\n528\n00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:57.021\nyou notice the E across your task bar and\nWindows, it's like it doesn't really look\n\n529\n00:26:57.021 --> 00:27:00.624\nsymmetrical in any way.\nIt's cuz it's resolution setting.\n\n530\n00:27:00.624 --> 00:27:02.064\nIt used to happen in the old CRTs,\n\n531\n00:27:02.064 --> 00:27:02.674\nthank Goodness,\n\n532\n00:27:02.674 --> 00:27:08.550\nthey don't call out CRTs anymore on\nthe exam because it could be magnetized.\n\n533\n00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.160\nAny magnet that's sat next to it\nwould distort the image, right?\n\n534\n00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.180\nYou'd have to do degaussing but\nI wouldn't worry about that on the exam.\n\n535\n00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.320\n&gt;&gt; Learned that lesson the hard way,\nI was like, I don't know, ten,\n\n536\n00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.790\nI took a magnet up to the TV,\nI was like, that's cool.\n\n537\n00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then it didn't go away.\n\n538\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n539\n00:27:23.972 --> 00:27:24.904\n&gt;&gt; And mom and dad come out and\n\n540\n00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:26.060\nI'm like they're real happy.\n\n541\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.134\n&gt;&gt; What did you just do to my TV,\nI'm gonna be missing Wapner?\n\n542\n00:27:29.134 --> 00:27:29.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n543\n00:27:29.888 --> 00:27:30.609\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n544\n00:27:30.609 --> 00:27:34.530\nSo, again, we don't really have to\nworry about that too much here cuz\n\n545\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.190\nas far as the CRTs and the LCDs,\n\n546\n00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:43.690\nyou don't have a magnetic image spreader\nlike you did in the earlier CRT monitors.\n\n547\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.437\nWhat else there Dan?\n\n548\n00:27:44.437 --> 00:27:48.558\nBurned in image, we kinda talked\nabout that, some people say LCDs,\n\n549\n00:27:48.558 --> 00:27:53.830\nLEDs aren't really susceptible to that,\nyes, they are, we've got machines here.\n\n550\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:59.580\nI had just a recent XPS and I know Ronny\n\n551\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.010\nhad this problem too in one of his\nepisodes where it was power hour and\n\n552\n00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:11.300\nhe did quite a few episodes and shurn off\nwhen he took down his simple diagram.\n\n553\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.720\nThe diagram software that he had,\n\n554\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.170\nyou could still see the diagram\nright across the image.\n\n555\n00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.990\nSo yes, it does happen, just keep in mind.\n\n556\n00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:21.290\nYou keep any image painted on\na screen statically for too long,\n\n557\n00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.143\nyou could have the remnants stay behind.\n\n558\n00:28:24.143 --> 00:28:28.417\nOversized images and icons, just like we\ntalked about with distorted images as\n\n559\n00:28:28.417 --> 00:28:30.724\nwell, keep in mind, lower resolutions.\n\n560\n00:28:30.724 --> 00:28:35.764\nIf you set a machine or a monitor or\neven a projector, if you will for\n\n561\n00:28:35.764 --> 00:28:40.624\nthat matter, or any display really,\nto a resolution lower than\n\n562\n00:28:40.624 --> 00:28:45.670\nwhat it's expecting,\nyou get all kinds of crazy things, right?\n\n563\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:51.540\nYou're increasing the size of the icons\nbut you're not increasing the resolution.\n\n564\n00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.830\nYou could be decreasing it and\nmaking it worse.\n\n565\n00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.530\nSo, again,\nremember with your TFT screens or\n\n566\n00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:02.870\nyour LCD and LED screens,\nremember native fixed resolution, right?\n\n567\n00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.780\nNow, I'm saying native fixed like\nthey're two completely separate things,\n\n568\n00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.400\nthey're synonymous terms, right?\n\n569\n00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.301\nA native resolution is the one\nthat that monitors supports,\n\n570\n00:29:11.301 --> 00:29:15.430\nthat's what they call it, fixed,\nbecause you can change the resolution but\n\n571\n00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.270\nit doesn't mean you're gonna improve the\npicture quality and a lot of times you're\n\n572\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.130\ngonna do the opposite, you're gonna\nmake the quality a little bit less.\n\n573\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.480\nSo quite a few different things\nthere that you gotta keep in mind.\n\n574\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.740\nDan [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this isn't on your notes or\n\n575\n00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.690\nanything, but\nas a guy who's been in the trenches, and\n\n576\n00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:36.100\nthought I had seen all display issues,\nI have come across at least one very,\n\n577\n00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.150\nvery strange one which is\ninside of Windows specifically.\n\n578\n00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.540\nThey have the ability to increase\nfont sizes or readability,\n\n579\n00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:48.250\nand it can kinda mess up\nthird party software.\n\n580\n00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.661\nIt will work great for the operating\nsystem, but you look at [INAUDIBLE], and\n\n581\n00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:56.810\nyour like, why is this over scanning or\nthings aren't going in their proper spot?\n\n582\n00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.480\nAnd I've had users say,\nthis isn't looking correct.\n\n583\n00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.080\nI'm increasing the font size,\nI'm decreasing the font size, resolution.\n\n584\n00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.600\n&gt;&gt; Scaling.\n\n585\n00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Changing things, right.\n\n586\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.000\nIt's the scaling feature inside of the\noperating system that they had changed and\n\n587\n00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.970\nit was modifying how a third\nparty software was acting.\n\n588\n00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.238\nSo don't think that wouldn't also be the\ncause of maybe some display issues that\n\n589\n00:30:18.238 --> 00:30:19.925\nyou might be running into.\n\n590\n00:30:19.925 --> 00:30:24.180\nBut Wes, other than that, you've gone\nthrough a great litany of I would say\n\n591\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.760\nthe vast majority if not all the rest of\nthe display issues I've ever encountered.\n\n592\n00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.350\nAnything else that we need to be aware of?\n\n593\n00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.520\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna tell you,\n\n594\n00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.910\none of the telltale signs at scaling set\noff is when you look at your common web\n\n595\n00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:38.040\nbrowsers and you have a normal\nzoom size and it still looks off.\n\n596\n00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.950\nThat's one of the first ways because,\nlike you said, some applications,\n\n597\n00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.090\nthey don't like it at all.\n\n598\n00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.061\n&gt;&gt; No, they dont.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the telltale signs\n\n599\n00:30:44.061 --> 00:30:47.950\nthat font size and scaling size have\nbeen kind of set incorrectly is when you\n\n600\n00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.145\nopen that web browser and you're like,\nwow, half of that webpage is missing and\n\n601\n00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:54.018\nwhen I look at the zoom it says 0%.\n\n602\n00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:54.660\nRight?\nSo\n\n603\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.940\nI was just gonna mention\nto kinda expand on that.\n\n604\n00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.916\nThat's one of the first signs that\nI've had to tell people, hey okay, so\n\n605\n00:31:00.916 --> 00:31:04.420\nwhat's your zoom set to and they say,\nwell, I haven't zoomed in at all.\n\n606\n00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.123\nAnd they're still getting\nthat kind of distorted image.\n\n607\n00:31:07.123 --> 00:31:09.221\n&gt;&gt; I spent weeks on that by the way.\n\n608\n00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:12.198\nI say weeks, it was like two days but,\nWes, thanks so much for\n\n609\n00:31:12.198 --> 00:31:14.395\nexplaining the different displays issues.\n\n610\n00:31:14.395 --> 00:31:15.134\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n611\n00:31:15.134 --> 00:31:18.254\n&gt;&gt; That we're gonna be\nencountering as A+ technicians and\n\n612\n00:31:18.254 --> 00:31:21.030\nas someone who is preparing for\nthe A+ exam.\n\n613\n00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.990\nBut it does look like we are out\nof time for this episode.\n\n614\n00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.270\nWe do thank you for joining us,\nhopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n615\n00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.100\nWe sure try hard that you do.\n\n616\n00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.840\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n617\n00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n618\n00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.954\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n619\n00:31:32.954 -->

[INAUDIBLE]\n\n3\n00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:08.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.270\n&gt;&gt; Youre watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.570\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.276\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode is more NRA plus series and\n\n7\n00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:23.290\ngood old 29 01, to be exact.\n\n8\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.590\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.910\nagain, lending his expertise on the topic,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.280\nWes, how's it going today, my man?\n\n11\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.000\nThat's right, we are moving through\nour troubleshooting sections, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.390\nIn a previous episode,\nwe showed you a little bit on how to,\n\n14\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.250\nwell, troubleshoot things like your\nhard drives and your RAID arrays.\n\n15\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.270\nWell, In 901, we've also talked about some\nof the hardware that tallow us to move\n\n16\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.830\ncommunications across the network, between\na few end points, a couple end points.\n\n17\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.200\nSo, that is what we're gonna dive\nin today is troubleshooting some\n\n18\n00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.240\nof our network communications.\n\n19\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.372\nIt is important to understand that when\nit comes to network communications,\n\n20\n00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:02.005\nwe have wired devices, and\nwe have wireless devices, if you will.\n\n21\n00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.469\nAnd, when we look at the two\ndifferent communication types,\n\n22\n00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.610\nthe communication media if you will.\n\n23\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.670\nSome of them can have very\nsimilar issues if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.460\nAnd then some of them can have some\ndistinct issues that you might have to\n\n25\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.710\nrecognize if you will diagnose,\nresolve and/or remediate.\n\n26\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.340\nSo we're gonna dive into\nboth the wired side,\n\n27\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.500\nas well as the wireless side, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500\nSo the official objectives here,\ngiven a scenario, troubleshoot wired and\n\n29\n00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.330\nwireless networks with\nthe appropriate tools.\n\n30\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.208\nNow some of these tools can be as\nsimple as a logical based tool.\n\n31\n00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:40.070\nAgain, a software based tool that you\nfind within your Operating System.\n\n32\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.180\nSometimes, we need physical tools, right?\n\n33\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.930\nWe need devices like this,\nlike a cable tester, if you will,\n\n34\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.980\nthat allows us to see that there is\nsomething physically wrong with the cable.\n\n35\n00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.330\nIf we use things like software and\nwe find out.\n\n36\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.810\nWell, the software is telling us\nthat there's something wrong, but\n\n37\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.070\nwe can't see it inside\nof the Operating System.\n\n38\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.050\nSo we will be talking\nabout the different tools,\n\n39\n00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.350\nas well as the symptoms that you can see.\n\n40\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.134\nAnd some of those things that, or\n\n41\n00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:07.522\nsome of those issues that actually\ncause some of the symptoms.\n\n42\n00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:11.018\nRemember, we do have symptoms,\nwe don't want to just treat the symptoms.\n\n43\n00:02:11.018 --> 00:02:14.818\nWe also wanna treat the cause to make\nsure that those symptoms don't manifest\n\n44\n00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:15.817\nthemselves again.\n\n45\n00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:19.350\nAll right, so, common systems,\nor symptoms, excuse me.\n\n46\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.260\nWhat are some of the symptoms\nthat they call out.\n\n47\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.616\nWell, the first one they call out is,\nwell, no connectivity.\n\n48\n00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.470\nAll right, we talk about no connectivity.\n\n49\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.780\nWe've mentioned, Dan and\nI in past episodes,\n\n50\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.370\nwe've mentioned start with\nthe simple fixes first, right.\n\n51\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.450\nOne of the most simplistic fixes\nthat you can look at for instance,\n\n52\n00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.246\nin fact we've got a computer here, you've\nprobably seen it when we started out.\n\n53\n00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:43.160\nYes it is upside down,\nbecause we need to look at the back plane.\n\n54\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.751\nWe need to be able to see\nthe back side if you will,\n\n55\n00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:48.994\nof the case where the motherboard's\nintegrated ports are.\n\n56\n00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:52.570\nBecause this is where we're gonna start\nwhen it comes to no connectivity.\n\n57\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.984\nSimple fixes first is\nlooking at the cable.\n\n58\n00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:59.515\nSo if we can check that out, we have,\nyou can see a yellow ethernet cable here.\n\n59\n00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:04.580\nAnd it is running into the RJ-45 jack that\nis on the back of the computer, right.\n\n60\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.530\nThis is the network adapter,\n\n61\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.540\nessentially that is integrated into\nthe motherboard itself, all right.\n\n62\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.160\nAnd I only have a single computer\nhooked up to, in this case,\n\n63\n00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.120\nthis is a wired connection, right.\n\n64\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.500\nIt is a wireless access point.\n\n65\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.360\nRemember the wireless access\npoints guys and girls out there,\n\n66\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.520\nthis is really technically\na SOHO-based multi-functioning device.\n\n67\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.980\nIf I was to tip this up here a little bit,\nyou could see the ports, right?\n\n68\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.050\nThe ports on the back of\nit where this is connected.\n\n69\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.330\nThat's actually a switch, right?\n\n70\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.070\nThat performs the switching functionality,\nif you will, on these devices.\n\n71\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.994\nAnd I can also-\n&gt;&gt; Two for one, right?\n\n72\n00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:40.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, all in one.\n\n73\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.420\nSo we get 802.11 wireless communication,\nas well as the wired communication.\n\n74\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.760\nSo, it kinda suits our purposes\nhere when we talk about wired and\n\n75\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.130\nwireless symptoms that can happen,\nall right.\n\n76\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.730\nSo like we talked about in the past,\n\n77\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.630\nthe first thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna check connections, right?\n\n78\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.880\nWhen we look at connections, we're\nlooking for things like activity lights.\n\n79\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.150\nSo for instance, you can see here that we\ndo have what's known as the link light.\n\n80\n00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.830\nThe link light, these lights could be\na couple of different colors here.\n\n81\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.920\nYou can see also on\nthe other side of this,\n\n82\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.790\nhere we can see the activity\nlight kind of blinking here.\n\n83\n00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.540\nNow I don't have any information going\nacross this network adapter right now, so\n\n84\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.188\nunderstand, it's kind of quiet.\n\n85\n00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:22.100\nI can say that it's communicating, if you\nwill, on the access point side too, so\n\n86\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.474\nthat is important, right.\n\n87\n00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:25.938\nA lot of times when we say check\nthe cables, some people think,\n\n88\n00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:28.090\nwell, just check the back of the computer.\n\n89\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.510\nWell, in a home environment,\n\n90\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.540\nit's also just as simple to check the\nactivity light on the axis point itself.\n\n91\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.380\nCuz we do have to keep in mind that,\nwell, this is a physical device, and\n\n92\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.760\nlike any man made device,\nit's gonna last for a certain while.\n\n93\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.200\nAnd then it could just decide that it's\ngonna take a vacation and no longer work.\n\n94\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.310\nRight, go on a permanent sabbatical,\nif you will.\n\n95\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.475\nSo, we also have to check and\nmake sure that we have a link light.\n\n96\n00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:51.089\nNow, I also want you to remember\nthat these link lights,\n\n97\n00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:52.835\nthey can have a few different colors.\n\n98\n00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:56.029\nBecause standards are important too,\nwhen we talk about that and\n\n99\n00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.540\nyou can see some of these\nwill change their colors.\n\n100\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.930\nIf you're running the older 100 megabits\nswitches, kinda rare today but, I mean,\n\n101\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.940\nyou never say never, right?\n\n102\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.590\nAnd usually, you'll see that\nthey'll be like for instance,\n\n103\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.500\nthis one is a green light when it\nis running at a gigabit speed too.\n\n104\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.240\nAll right, so that's one of\nthe first things we wanna check.\n\n105\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.380\nAnd what would be some of the symptoms,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.720\nWell, you could say the obvious symptom\nwould be that you can't connect to\n\n107\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.580\nthe network, or even maybe you can't\nconnect to the Internet, right?\n\n108\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.510\nI mean, that would be obvious.\n\n109\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.710\nBut if I pull this connector, right?\n\n110\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.600\nNotice what happens here, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.880\nNotice that the link light,\nfor one, is gone, right?\n\n112\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.120\nThat little amber light there is gone.\n\n113\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.000\nNow, don't get tripped up\non the amber versus green.\n\n114\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.361\nI've seen some of these where they're\ngreen, some where they're amber.\n\n115\n00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.160\nI've seen it actually where the shell's\nkind of got a plastic housing around it.\n\n116\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.800\nAnd the whole RJ45 jack actually turns\ngreen and kind of flickers on and\n\n117\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.440\noff, as well.\n\n118\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.120\nSo again,\ndon't get too tripped up on that.\n\n119\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.264\nBut I also noticed something here, right?\n\n120\n00:05:50.264 --> 00:05:54.540\nNotice that when I unplug\nthis from the computer side,\n\n121\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.390\nI also noticed that the activity\nlight failed, if you will,\n\n122\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.750\nor is no longer turned\non on the access point.\n\n123\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.184\nSo, this cable,\nagain when we check physical connections,\n\n124\n00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:07.830\nkeep in mind that it could be this\nside of the connection, right.\n\n125\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.920\nAnd if we give it a second here, it's\nhopefully going to call out with DHCP.\n\n126\n00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.420\nAnd that's another thing too,\n\n127\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.160\nthat we need to discuss, might actually\ngive you no connectivity, either.\n\n128\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.274\nNotice that it is restored here,\nas well on the access point.\n\n129\n00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:25.120\nNow the other thing to keep in mind, I've\ngot a little cable management going here.\n\n130\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.440\nWe kinda try to keep the rats\nnest down to a minimum here.\n\n131\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.512\nBut if I unplug this cable from the access\npoint, notice that it manifests itself.\n\n132\n00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.706\nSame thing, right,\nthe same symptoms happen.\n\n133\n00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:37.112\nI lose the activity light,\nif you will, and\n\n134\n00:06:37.112 --> 00:06:40.060\nthe link light on\nthe network adapter itself.\n\n135\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.810\nBut I also lose it here on the AP,\nthe access point too.\n\n136\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.876\nSo which one is it?\n\n137\n00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:47.857\nAnd that's why we say yes, we do want\nyou to check the back of the cable,\n\n138\n00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:49.820\ncuz you're usually\nclosest to the computer.\n\n139\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.607\nAnd a lot of the times you're\ncloser to the computer than you\n\n140\n00:06:51.607 --> 00:06:52.299\nare the access point.\n\n141\n00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:54.011\nAgain, that's not set in stone,\n\n142\n00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.590\nsome people actually have their\naccess point right on their desk.\n\n143\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.170\nThat's actually really convenient,\nso you can also check this side.\n\n144\n00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.190\nSo keep in mind, both sides have to\nbe checked when we say the cable.\n\n145\n00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.485\nAnd the other thing that can happen too\nis notice that we have a series of ports.\n\n146\n00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:11.979\nNow, I got another cable\nhooked up to this port, but\n\n147\n00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.113\nit could be the port on the access\npoint that's failing, right?\n\n148\n00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:18.998\nSo if we plug this in, and\nthis is the result that we see,\n\n149\n00:07:18.998 --> 00:07:21.160\nwe don't have any light here.\n\n150\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.090\nWe don't have a link or activity light.\n\n151\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.836\nOne of the things you can\ndo is you can just move it.\n\n152\n00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:29.981\nI say that, let's see if I can do this on\ncamera without falling on my face here.\n\n153\n00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:31.819\nYou can move it to another port, and\n\n154\n00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.220\nnotice that we start to get activity,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.820\nSo the light that's over here\nis no longer working obviously,\n\n156\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.840\ncuz it's plugged into the second port.\n\n157\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.370\nOur activity light and our link light\nstart to, start to come on again.\n\n158\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.830\nNow, what is the difference here?\n\n159\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.377\nAll right, well you could have a link\nlight, which means that when the carrier\n\n160\n00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:53.383\nsends multiple access collision detection,\nif you will, that Ethernet's based on.\n\n161\n00:07:53.383 --> 00:07:55.423\nIt can sense that the carrier's present.\n\n162\n00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:58.730\nIt knows that the media is there and\nthat's your link light.\n\n163\n00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.427\nIt has a connection.\n\n164\n00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:04.171\nBut I will tell you that sometimes,\nyou can get a link light and\n\n165\n00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.261\nyou don't get an activity light.\n\n166\n00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:07.820\nSo let me show you here,\nso let's go ahead.\n\n167\n00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.553\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nlook at the interface of the computer here\n\n168\n00:08:12.553 --> 00:08:14.300\nthat this is connected into.\n\n169\n00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.053\nSo you can kinda see what it\nwould look like when it comes to,\n\n170\n00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:19.640\non the computer itself.\n\n171\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.930\nSo, we've actually got\na Windows machine here.\n\n172\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.863\nAnd my head's kind of\ncovering this one up,\n\n173\n00:08:23.863 --> 00:08:27.416\nbecause you know, that good old task bar,\nthey definitely like to put you know,\n\n174\n00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:30.310\nthe little monitor icon down here\nin the lower right hand corner.\n\n175\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.510\nBut what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna right click on the monitor icon,\n\n176\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.990\nand we're gonna choose Open Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n177\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.740\nNow, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n178\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.520\nunderstand there's many different ways\nthat you can get to this utility.\n\n179\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.060\nThis is just one of the quick\nways that I like to get to it.\n\n180\n00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.900\nAnd, we're gonna go to,\nover here on the other side here.\n\n181\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.310\nWe're gonna go to this\nChange adapter settings.\n\n182\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.439\nRemember, this is where\nyou modify the properties,\n\n183\n00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:57.090\nTCP IP properties of\nyour network adapters.\n\n184\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.500\nWhen it comes to verifying and\nchanging things like IP address,\n\n185\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.290\nand then how the IP address\nmight be obtained or configured.\n\n186\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.970\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\n\n187\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.320\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna right\nclick on our little network adapter here.\n\n188\n00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.510\nWe're gonna come down and\nwhat we're looking for is Properties.\n\n189\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.620\nAgain, when we get into properties,\n\n190\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.400\nyou will see that we have\na series of protocols.\n\n191\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.190\nNow, as you go on to learn more in your\nlater network training if you will,\n\n192\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.490\nyou'll notice that we have\na series of protocols here.\n\n193\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.680\nThese are what are called bindings,\nprotocol bindings.\n\n194\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.790\nGuys, that's not really a highly technical\nterm, it just means that this network\n\n195\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.660\nadapter knows how to speak those rules for\ncommunication.\n\n196\n00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:40.160\nAnd what we usually do in here is we look\nat things like IPv4 and even IPv6 today.\n\n197\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.020\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n198\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.920\nLet's select Internet Protocol\nversion four,\n\n199\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.420\nand then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna choose the Properties icon.\n\n200\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.390\nAnd notice that I have an IP\naddress obtained automatically.\n\n201\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.920\nNow, I want you to notice something that\nif I decide that I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n202\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.980\nthis is another thing that might give\nyou zero connectivity, all right.\n\n203\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.720\nI know that the IP address or the network\nID of this network is 192.168.1.0.\n\n204\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.260\nWell, if I come in here and\nI say, you know,\n\n205\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.680\nI really don't like that number, Dan.\n\n206\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.720\nIn fact, it's easier for\nme to type 10.10.10.10, and I just,\n\n207\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.400\nI throw something in here, right?\n\n208\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.330\nAnd maybe,\nI throw some kinda random default gateway.\n\n209\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.310\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; You like that?\n\n210\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.780\nSo we'll just guess numbers.\n\n211\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.710\nNow it's kinda interesting,\nbecause we're setting this up, and\n\n212\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.610\nnow we have a static IP address,\nall right?\n\n213\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.327\nAnd one of things that you might notice\nis that the network adapter is kind of\n\n214\n00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:36.755\ncalling out to the network.\n\n215\n00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:40.237\nThere's a lot of services that go on\nin the background that are called zero\n\n216\n00:10:40.237 --> 00:10:44.467\nconfigurations, zero config technologies,\nthat we don't directly interact with.\n\n217\n00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:47.097\nBut the Operating System sure\nknows how to speak them, and\n\n218\n00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:50.477\nit calls out to the network and it says,\nhey, I'm trying to communicate.\n\n219\n00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:53.700\nNow, if we could go back\nto the computer real quick,\n\n220\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.627\nI wanna show you something here on the\nback of that network adapter, all right?\n\n221\n00:10:58.627 --> 00:11:00.707\nNow, I still have connection, right.\n\n222\n00:11:00.707 --> 00:11:04.271\nBut you'll notice something,\nand I got a link light, but\n\n223\n00:11:04.271 --> 00:11:06.400\nI have connection to the network.\n\n224\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.942\nSo you have to understand that no\nconnectivity, when you check those cables,\n\n225\n00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:11.610\nsometimes the cables lie, right.\n\n226\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.750\nI mean these, Dan what do you think?\n\n227\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.430\nThese cables are kind of lying to us\nright now, not maybe the cables but\n\n228\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.350\nthe indicators right?\n\n229\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.339\n&gt;&gt; Right, because, well I mean\nthey're live, they're misleading us,\n\n230\n00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:20.320\nlet's put it that way.\n\n231\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.200\nNot necessarily lying,\nthey are saying I am connected,\n\n232\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.560\nthe status of that connection is good,\nI can pass data, But\n\n233\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.050\nit doesn't mean I have actually\nconnectivity to a network.\n\n234\n00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and lets talk\na little about why that is, right.\n\n235\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.850\nA switch doesn't care about IP, so\nit doesn't matter what IP I put on it.\n\n236\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.560\nThat switch, we still have\na direct connection to the switch.\n\n237\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.460\nSo we're still getting some communication,\n\n238\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.030\nif I can communicate that,\n[LAUGH] regardless of IP.\n\n239\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.943\nSo understand that again\ngoing back to the actual,\n\n240\n00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:54.130\nthe desktop here inside of our computer.\n\n241\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.659\nI have an IP address, in fact,\nI could even say hey,\n\n242\n00:11:57.659 --> 00:12:00.000\nI think I should have connection.\n\n243\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.508\nI know I have an IP address\nI can turn around here, and\n\n244\n00:12:02.508 --> 00:12:04.050\nwe can fire up a command prompt.\n\n245\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.904\nAnd when we fire up a command prompt, I\ncan do the IP config, and with IP config,\n\n246\n00:12:08.904 --> 00:12:12.810\nI can sit here and run this,\nand say well, I should be okay.\n\n247\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.506\nSo keep in mind that no connectivity\nmight be the fact that you have a static\n\n248\n00:12:17.506 --> 00:12:19.340\nconfiguration on a device.\n\n249\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.540\nAnd it isn't statically or\nmanually set appropriately.\n\n250\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.420\nNow, the other thing that we also have\nto do is potentially, we could have DHCP\n\n251\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.150\nthat is turned off inside\nof the access point.\n\n252\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.310\nSo the next thing that we have to do,\nif we get no connectivity, right,\n\n253\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.920\nand we have, let's say we do have it.\n\n254\n00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.530\nIn fact, let's go back to\nthe desktop here real quick.\n\n255\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.470\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set\nthis computer back to a dynamic address.\n\n256\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.350\nAnd, again, remember, we're just gonna\nright click on our Network Adapter, and\n\n257\n00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.520\nwe're gonna choose Properties.\n\n258\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.900\nAnd then, from there,\nwhat we'll do is we'll choose IPv4.\n\n259\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.550\nAgain, choose OK.\n\n260\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.660\nAnd apparently,\nI should have just chose Properties.\n\n261\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.240\nLet's try that again.\n\n262\n00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.530\nSo, swing and a miss.\n\n263\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.150\nWe'll right click on the Network Adapter,\nchoose Properties.\n\n264\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.520\nWe'll select IPv4, and\nchoose Properties this time, not OK.\n\n265\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.400\nAnd we're gonna switch this back to\nobtaining an IP address automatically.\n\n266\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.560\nSame thing with our DNS servers, we'll\napply the settings, we'll say Close here.\n\n267\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.010\nAnd of the things you'll notice\nis that the big difference here.\n\n268\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.460\nNotice that I do have a network and\nit does say it knows,\n\n269\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.710\nit's talking to the access point.\n\n270\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.890\nAnd it's saying okay, I can communicate in\nsome of these services that are going on\n\n271\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.950\nin the background.\n\n272\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.890\nIt can establish that hey,\nI do have a connection to the network.\n\n273\n00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.730\nBut, what happens if we've\ngot this set to DHCP, and\n\n274\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.690\nunfortunately the access\npoint isn't set there.\n\n275\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.970\nSo what we need to do now is we'll go\nahead and we will look at the interface\n\n276\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.800\ninside of the wireless access point\nthat we've been working with.\n\n277\n00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.000\nAll right, Dan, I know you've probably\ndone this more times than you can count.\n\n278\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.270\nTo get into that access point out there,\nladies and gentleman,\n\n279\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:58.020\nyou really have to find out what the IP\naddress is to the access point yourself.\n\n280\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.015\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] bribe a council\nmember sometimes [LAUGH].\n\n281\n00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:02.403\n&gt;&gt; You might have to do that\nto get the IP, that's right.\n\n282\n00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:06.504\nSo keep in mind that the default gateway,\nthe IP address of the default\n\n283\n00:14:06.504 --> 00:14:10.327\ngateway within your home networks\nespecially or specifically,\n\n284\n00:14:10.327 --> 00:14:14.510\na lot of times is the same IP address\nthat you can type in any web browser.\n\n285\n00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.650\nIt doesn't matter if it's Chrome,\nFirefox, If you will.\n\n286\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.810\nIf it's Internet Explorer Edge, and\nyou just have to know, essentially,\n\n287\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.310\nwhat the user name and password is.\n\n288\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.680\nThis one, I've kind of got just for\nthe purposes of the show.\n\n289\n00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.980\nAnd Wes is typing because you guys\nhave seen my typing skills out there.\n\n290\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.090\nI left it with the defaults, we've done\na reset on it, so it's just admin admin.\n\n291\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.480\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nsecurity when it comes to steering away\n\n292\n00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.180\nfrom the default.\n\n293\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.500\nThat's not something you would wanna\ndo in a production environment.\n\n294\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.600\nBut what I really wanna,\nkinda look at is that,\n\n295\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.340\nnotice that we have some\nDHCP server settings, right?\n\n296\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.111\nAnd notice that DHCP is enabled, and\n\n297\n00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:52.634\nwhat that means is that there's a listing,\nright?\n\n298\n00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:55.780\nThe Start IP Address says, hey, it's\ngonna start right here, 192.168.1.100.\n\n299\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.950\nAnd then, you can see that the IP\naddress range is up to 0.149.\n\n300\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.060\nGuys, think of that as a phone book,\nright.\n\n301\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.480\nHow many listings,\nhow many IP addresses do I have available?\n\n302\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.020\nIn this case, you have 50 IP addresses.\n\n303\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.150\nAs far as where you wanna start,\nyou can always change this, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.950\nNow here's a problem.\n\n305\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.810\nIf I turn around and we disabled this,\nthis could cause some problems, right?\n\n306\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.210\nAnd this could lead to no connectivity.\n\n307\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.600\nAnd if you have DHCP set up on the box\nhere, whatever the device might be.\n\n308\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.070\nIt calls out to the network and\nsays, hey, I need an IP address, and\n\n309\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.000\nall it hears is crickets, right?\n\n310\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.680\nThe DHCP service isn't running.\n\n311\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.740\nNow and don't let that term\nserver really trip you up here.\n\n312\n00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.410\nYou've seen it's just an access point.\n\n313\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.210\nIt's not a real beefy machine here.\n\n314\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.154\nServer again think service, right?\n\n315\n00:15:49.154 --> 00:15:51.197\nA server is defined by\nthe role that it's providing.\n\n316\n00:15:51.197 --> 00:15:55.381\nIn this case, they call it a server,\nbecause it's offering up the DHCP service.\n\n317\n00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:59.384\nBut again A lot of your devices,\nmodems even, cable modems will do this,\n\n318\n00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:03.770\nDSL modems will do this, where\nthey'll actually offer a DHCP service.\n\n319\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.160\nBut, if it's disabled,\nwe could have a problem here, right?\n\n320\n00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.035\nWe could have a problem in\nthe fact that our computers or\n\n321\n00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:13.620\nour devices that are looking for\ncommunication out there,\n\n322\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.360\nthey call out and\nthey don't get any IP address, all right?\n\n323\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.700\nSo those are some of the things,\nwhen it comes to network connectivity.\n\n324\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.300\nThere are other things that we\nhave to consider too, right?\n\n325\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.860\nWe have to consider things like,\nfor instance, drivers, right?\n\n326\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.330\nDrivers might be the issue and\nthis is because,\n\n327\n00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.550\nwell, network adapter\nis a hardware device.\n\n328\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.090\nAnd if you don't have\nthe appropriate driver,\n\n329\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.450\nyour operating system isn't gonna be\nable to communicate, if you will,\n\n330\n00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.640\nwith the network adapter, which by\nassociation means it won't be able to\n\n331\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.030\ncontrol it to call out to the network and\ngrab that IP address.\n\n332\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.260\nSo the next thing we have to\ndo is kinda look at well,\n\n333\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.460\nif the drivers are available, right?\n\n334\n00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.620\nSo let's go ahead and what we're\ngonna do is we'll dive back into\n\n335\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.480\nthis machine's desktop, and\nwe'll take a look at those drivers.\n\n336\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.590\nAll right, so we're back on the desktop of\nour Windows machine, and I know Dan and\n\n337\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.990\nI said we were gonna go ahead and\nlook at drivers, but you know what?\n\n338\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.190\nLet's go ahead and see.\n\n339\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.290\nWe disabled the DHCP service\non our access point.\n\n340\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.170\nLet's see how that would manifest\nitself inside of our computer.\n\n341\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.470\nSo I'm going to go ahead, and what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to bring up,\n\n342\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.460\nfirst of all, I'll go ahead and\nbring up a command prompt.\n\n343\n00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:25.040\nAnd we can choose Windows key R, and\ntype cmd into the little run line.\n\n344\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.420\nI'll go ahead and so\na cd\\ and clear the screen,\n\n345\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.240\ngives us a little more real estate\nwithin the command prompt here.\n\n346\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.905\nAnd we're gonna run an ipconfig, and,\nor close to it, we're gonna run a\n\n347\n00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:36.670\n&gt;&gt; [overlapping]\n\n348\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.830\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna run a stuttering ipconfig,\n\n349\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.600\nwith a space forward slash all option, and\n\n350\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.770\nwe'll go ahead and look at this,\nnow it's kind of interesting.\n\n351\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.890\nNotice something, we disabled DHCP,\nbut I still have an IP address.\n\n352\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:48.960\nWhat is that about?\n\n353\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.180\nWell, remember when we were talking\nabout DHCP issuing out IP addresses?\n\n354\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.170\nDan and I kind of referenced the rental\ncar analogy that said hey, if I call\n\n355\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.630\nthe rental car company and I rent a car\nfor a week, well it's mine for a week.\n\n356\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.000\nBut at the end,\nI either have to do one of two things.\n\n357\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.550\nI have to extend the rental,\nyou know the rental agreement,\n\n358\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.610\nmaybe going into another week or\nI have to return the car.\n\n359\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.990\nWell DHCP does the exact same\nthing with its IP addresses and\n\n360\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.598\nyou can kind of see that manifested\nitself in these two lines right here.\n\n361\n00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:19.880\nSo for instance,\nnotice it says lease obtained,\n\n362\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.845\nlets me know when I started\nrenting the car, right?\n\n363\n00:18:21.845 --> 00:18:27.300\nLease expires lets me know when the rental\ncontract kind of is null and void.\n\n364\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.520\nI have to give the IP address back, right?\n\n365\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.530\nSo it's when you obtain the IP address\nversus how long can you have it.\n\n366\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.710\nNow, that's also something that I really\ndidn't mention here when we were talking\n\n367\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.750\nabout DHCP is that a lease,\n\n368\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:46.950\neven if you've disabled the DHCP service,\nit might not manifest itself right away.\n\n369\n00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.600\nIt might be at the end of that lease\nperiod when it gives that IP address back,\n\n370\n00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.660\nand it starts that door process over, and\n\n371\n00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.220\nsays, hey,\nanybody got an IP address out there?\n\n372\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.160\nAnd you don't get one.\n\n373\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.290\nSo we can actually return the rental car,\nright?\n\n374\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.230\nWe can get right of this DHCP\nobtained address, and we can run.\n\n375\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.620\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nclear the screen here.\n\n376\n00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.300\nWhat we can do is we can,\ninstead of running an IPcong all,\n\n377\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.244\nwe can run an lP config and we can do\na release here and that kind of gives up.\n\n378\n00:19:15.244 --> 00:19:16.650\nThat turns in the rental car.\n\n379\n00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.840\nThat just says, okay l no longer need that\nIP address and then it's interesting,\n\n380\n00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.760\nwe can turn around and\n\n381\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.700\nwe can run what is known as an IP\nconfig space forward slash renew.\n\n382\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.740\nAnd when we run a renew,\nwe are generating the door process.\n\n383\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.360\nWe're starting that discover\noffer request acknowledge and\n\n384\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.680\nit could take a bit and\nit might not take a bit, right?\n\n385\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.420\nAnd you can notice something\nis probably up here and now,\n\n386\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.910\none of the things I said is depending\non how big your network is.\n\n387\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.335\nIn this case,\nwe're the only device communicating.\n\n388\n00:19:43.335 --> 00:19:44.385\nThere's no other device.\n\n389\n00:19:44.385 --> 00:19:48.770\nWell, my laptop is, but it's already\ngot an IP address from it, right?\n\n390\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.630\nSo, there's a telltale sign.\n\n391\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.260\nIn fact, you can also do this to\ntest your AP, your access point,\n\n392\n00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.530\nwired versus wireless access point,\n\n393\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:01.290\nto find out if the DHCP service is\nactually providing you with an IP address.\n\n394\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.050\nNow one of the things we don't see here is\nI still haven't obtained an IP address.\n\n395\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.230\nIn fact, if we can go back to that screen\nand kinda stay there for a second so\n\n396\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.250\nwe can see, is it going to happen?\n\n397\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.230\nAnd I can almost tell you,\nthat it's probably not going to happen.\n\n398\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.500\nIn fact, I'll go ahead Dan, and\nI'll just kind of ctrl+c this, you know,\n\n399\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.150\nI'll stop the command and\nwe'll rerun the ipconfig.\n\n400\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:28.320\nAnd I want the all option after it so that\nI can see, I actually have APIPA address.\n\n401\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.666\nI have an APIPA address and\nI have a link-local address,\n\n402\n00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:34.970\nand essentially what this means,\nremember we said with APIPA,\n\n403\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.680\nthe Automatic Private IP Address,\nor addressing?\n\n404\n00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.620\nIt means if I've done the door process in\nthe service that's running within Windows,\n\n405\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.030\nor has called out to the network and\nsays, hey I need an IP address and\n\n406\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.430\nit doesn't find one, it falls back and\n\n407\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.640\nit automatically assigns it\none of the IPVA addresses.\n\n408\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.380\nNow link-local happens as well\nbecause that's an IPV6 address and\n\n409\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.888\nyour computer actually\nassigns it automatically.\n\n410\n00:20:57.888 --> 00:21:01.700\nIn an IPV6, that's the way we're gonna\ncommunicate on the local network.\n\n411\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.820\nRemember, one of the things\nthat we've said is that IPV6,\n\n412\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.150\nyou could have multiple IPV6 addresses.\n\n413\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.940\nYou could have what's known a global\nunicast address that allows you to\n\n414\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.550\ncommunicate over the Internet\nlike a public address.\n\n415\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.310\nYou can have what's known as a unique\nlocal address which is kinda like your\n\n416\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.250\nprivate IP address, if you will,\nthat's not routable.\n\n417\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.590\nAnd then last but not least, you can also\nhave [LAUGH] The link local address is how\n\n418\n00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.960\nI connect on that local network\nthat we're directly attached to.\n\n419\n00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.610\nSo, that does come up as well.\n\n420\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.980\nI did wanna mention that\nbecause they do call that out.\n\n421\n00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:35.995\nThey talk about local, or\nthey talk about APIPA address link local.\n\n422\n00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:40.238\nIf DHCP service is turned off like that or\nyou can't communicate with a DHCP server,\n\n423\n00:21:40.238 --> 00:21:42.709\nyou're gonna get this type of address,\nright?\n\n424\n00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:45.846\nA 192.168, or excuse me I'm sorry.\n\n425\n00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:51.256\n[LAUGH] 169.254 address, throw the other\none I just said out of your mind.\n\n426\n00:21:51.256 --> 00:21:55.300\n169.254.anything.anything address.\n\n427\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:01.000\nSo, these are some of the things that can\ncause your connectivity or lack there of.\n\n428\n00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.610\nNo connectivity, right?\n\n429\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.310\nNow, I did mention drivers.\n\n430\n00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.170\nDrivers could be the issue as well,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n431\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.880\nlet's look at our Windows machine and\n\n432\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.320\nlet's go ahead and finish along that path,\nthat line of thought.\n\n433\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.910\nIf you go into your device,\nyou can actually,\n\n434\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.580\nthere's couple of different\nways you can do this.\n\n435\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.680\nIf you're in Windows 7 you can\nalways use the search field.\n\n436\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.100\nIf you're in Windows 8.1 you\ncan always right click and\n\n437\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.020\nyou have a couple of different things.\n\n438\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.090\nYou can go to device manager.\n\n439\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.720\nBut to tell you, on the CompTIA exam they\nmight ask you to go the scenic approach\n\n440\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.370\nand if that's the case you\ncan go to the Control Panel.\n\n441\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.990\nYou can go to your System and Security and\n\n442\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.240\nthen you can scroll down towards\nthe bottom, find Administrative Tools and\n\n443\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.590\nwell, [LAUGH] within the Administrative\nTools, you also have Device Manager as\n\n444\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.230\nwell, and I say that and I do not\nsee Device Manager in there anymore.\n\n445\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.210\nI wonder if they have, well you know what,\nwe've got Computer Management.\n\n446\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.620\nThat's another place that\nit's also built into as well.\n\n447\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.350\nI like it that it's right\non the Start menu today,\n\n448\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.650\njust by right-clicking on it or Windows\nkey x, cuz it gets you there fairly quick.\n\n449\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.440\nAlso understand that you\nhave Device Manager right\n\n450\n00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.660\nhere inside of Computer Management,\nwhich is kinda like your one stop shop for\n\n451\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.350\na lot of common utilities\nthat you would use.\n\n452\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:19.337\nYou can also use the old run\nline command devmgr.exe.\n\n453\n00:23:19.337 --> 00:23:22.080\nBut notice that we have\na series of our devices, right?\n\n454\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.960\nAnd this is where we actually can control,\nmanage,\n\n455\n00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.140\nand modify the devices\nthat are in our machines.\n\n456\n00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.280\nAnd Dan, we can see a little bit more than\nhalfway down there we've got the network\n\n457\n00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.430\nadapter in the list.\n\n458\n00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.490\nIf we expand the network adapter out, one\nof the things that we'll notice is that\n\n459\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.360\nwell, I don't see any\nproblems with this adapter.\n\n460\n00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.150\nHowever, if there happened to be like\na little exclamation point right here,\n\n461\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.970\nit might let me know that there's\nsome kind of driver issue.\n\n462\n00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.510\nIf you have like a, and\nI'm gonna try this.\n\n463\n00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.887\nI am not a talented drawer\nas you can see right there.\n\n464\n00:23:52.887 --> 00:23:55.590\nIf you have a question mark and\nit says Ethernet controller,\n\n465\n00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.137\nthen what that means is there\nisn't a driver available.\n\n466\n00:23:58.137 --> 00:23:59.981\nIt knows that it's an Ethernet device.\n\n467\n00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:01.486\nIt knows that it's a network adapter.\n\n468\n00:24:01.486 --> 00:24:05.067\nBut it has no clue what the vendor or\nmanufacturer's specifics are, so\n\n469\n00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:09.105\nit kinda throws it in other devices and\nsays, I'm really not sure what that is.\n\n470\n00:24:09.105 --> 00:24:11.590\nSo, that could cause no\nconnectivity as well.\n\n471\n00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.730\nAnd then, what you're gonna wanna\ndo is if you have any issue,\n\n472\n00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.000\nif you think it's a driver issue,\n\n473\n00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.070\nyou can always right click on the network\nadapter here, you can choose properties.\n\n474\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.330\nInside of the properties,\nyou'll notice that we do have this\n\n475\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.620\ndriver tab right here, and\nthat driver tab is very important.\n\n476\n00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.940\nNotice, that it also tells us,\nin this case, whether it's working or not.\n\n477\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.990\nAbsolutely love that, too,\nas a way to do a quick diagnosis.\n\n478\n00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.320\nNotice that you can find out what\nthe driver is to the device,\n\n479\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.980\nyou can see the driver details,\nwe could update the driver.\n\n480\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.440\nThe device might even be disabled, right?\n\n481\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.890\nLet me show you here,\nif you just actually disable the device,\n\n482\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.870\nit's going to warn you saying, hey,\nit'll cause it to stop working.\n\n483\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.770\nAnd if I choose OK, to this,\nyou're going to notice that,\n\n484\n00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.660\nnow I do have an icon that is\npresent in device manager, right?\n\n485\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.540\nAnd it's letting me know, hey, you're not\ngonna be able to use your network adapter.\n\n486\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.530\nSo, again,\nkeep that in mind that that is there too.\n\n487\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.580\nLet's see what it looks like\nin the background here.\n\n488\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.855\nYep, so\nyou can see that it is a disabled device.\n\n489\n00:25:13.855 --> 00:25:15.425\nThat would cause no connectivity.\n\n490\n00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:18.645\nThe good thing is it's kind of obvious\nbecause it does tell you that it is\n\n491\n00:25:18.645 --> 00:25:19.765\ndisconnected.\n\n492\n00:25:19.765 --> 00:25:21.105\nAnd one of the great things is,\n\n493\n00:25:21.105 --> 00:25:23.745\nwe can actually just right-click on\nit right here, just choose enable,\n\n494\n00:25:23.745 --> 00:25:26.840\nso a few different things\nthat you got to keep in mind.\n\n495\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.680\nI know we're running short on time,\non this one here.\n\n496\n00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.010\nSome of the other things that you\nmight have to worry about, right?\n\n497\n00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.970\nIf you have no connectivity,\n\n498\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.390\nlike an internet connection,\ndid you pay the bill, right?\n\n499\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.481\nI mean, we've talked about simple fixes,\n\n500\n00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:42.790\nprobably one of the most simplistic\nfixes is if you haven't paid the bill.\n\n501\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.830\nNow, with wire connections, we do want\nto mention things like, for instance,\n\n502\n00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.700\nare your cables crimped, and, what I mean\nby that, is not installing an RJ 45 jack.\n\n503\n00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.270\nI mean, literally,\nhave they sustained some damage.\n\n504\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.210\nRemember, simple fixes first,\nlook at the link lights.\n\n505\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:04.300\nInspect the cable if you need to, the\nother thing to keep in mind is that if you\n\n506\n00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.110\nhave somebody that's wired\nup that cable themselves and\n\n507\n00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:12.160\nthey've put the TEF568A\nwiring scheme on one side and\n\n508\n00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.470\nthe 568B on another side that actually\nforms what's known as a crossover cable.\n\n509\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:20.170\nAnd in administration we use this to\ncommunicate with things like access points\n\n510\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:24.025\ndirectly, if you will, or\nconnectivity devices or to make a direct\n\n511\n00:26:24.025 --> 00:26:27.980\npoint-to-point communication without\ngoing through the connectivity device.\n\n512\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.980\nAnd the problem is if that's plugged into\none of these APs or even a wired router,\n\n513\n00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.400\nit isn't going to allow\nyou to communicate.\n\n514\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.440\nDoesn't it matter if you\nhave an IP address or not.\n\n515\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.270\nDoesn't matter if it's statically set.\n\n516\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.490\nIt could cause problems.\n\n517\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:46.000\nSo also pay attention to the standards\nlike that when we talk about 568A and\n\n518\n00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000\n568B, you just have to make sure.\n\n519\n00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.660\nPay attention to the cable, and it's\nwhatever standard it is on both sides.\n\n520\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.400\nCommonly today it's gonna be 568B.\n\n521\n00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.880\nSo configuration, drivers, adapter issues,\nall things that can manifest themselves.\n\n522\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.970\nThere are things that are specific to\nthe wireless access point as well.\n\n523\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:08.220\nIf you have no connectivity, are you\nwithin the proximity of the access point?\n\n524\n00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.830\nYou might be too far away\nfrom the access point, right,\n\n525\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.460\nthat you're not getting that connectivity.\n\n526\n00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.370\nThe devices could be turned off themselves\njust like the network adapters we showed\n\n527\n00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.700\nyou disabling them and turning them off.\n\n528\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.830\nIf you have no power on the device,\nyou're not gonna have any connectivity.\n\n529\n00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, lots of different\nthings that could be causing issues\n\n530\n00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.480\nwhen it comes to network connectivity.\n\n531\n00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.050\nWe've really just scratched\nthe surface on things we can do and\n\n532\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.230\nthings we have to look at.\n\n533\n00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.790\nBut Wes, our time clock is saying,\nno mas, right?\n\n534\n00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.980\nWe've come to the end of an episode.\n\n535\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.540\nSo, it looks like we're in for\none of our wonderful multiparters.\n\n536\n00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.032\nI know this is probably gonna\ngo at least one more, right?\n\n537\n00:27:43.032 --> 00:27:44.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So join us back for that.\n\n538\n00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.570\nSee what you can do when you start\nhaving network connectivity issues.\n\n539\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.340\nThere's just a multitude of\nthings that could be wrong.\n\n540\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.690\nAnd like I said, we've just broken\nthrough on what that could possibly be.\n\n541\n00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.540\nBut, that being said,\n\n542\n00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.460\nsigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n543\n00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.356\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n544\n00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:07.408\n[MUSIC]\n\n545\n00:28:07.408 --> 00:28:10.509\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

--> 00:00:40.233\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n22\n00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.003\nSo we're going to talk a little bit more\n\n23\n00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.127\nabout some of the network\ntroubleshooting that you can see, right?\n\n24\n00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:47.425\nThere are plenty of things that they\n\n25\n00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:51.291\ncall out on the exam.\nAll good subjects, all good topics.\n\n26\n00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.965\nIn the first one we really talked about,\n\n27\n00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:56.106\nwell, just no connectivity.\nAnd that could manifest itself in so\n\n28\n00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:57.190\nmany ways.\nIn fact, so\n\n29\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.110\nmany ways I didn't get everyone\nof them in there, right?\n\n30\n00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.598\nIn fact, I was telling Dan this.\n\n31\n00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:04.669\nWe talked a lot about things like the\nwired connections, but I didn't mention\n\n32\n00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:08.200\nsome of the additional things that\nyou could see inside a wireless.\n\n33\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.900\nAnd more specifically, I did end on if\nyour proximity from the access point,\n\n34\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.270\nif you're not close to\nthe access point at all,\n\n35\n00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.400\nit can manifest itself\nin a couple of things.\n\n36\n00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.544\nBut again,\nfocusing on the no connectivity,\n\n37\n00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:24.258\nyou just might not be close\nenough to the transmitter.\n\n38\n00:01:24.258 --> 00:01:25.437\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n39\n00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:29.922\nThe other thing that I didn't mention is,\nwell, there can be some certain mismatches\n\n40\n00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:33.425\nthat maybe your network adapter\nis supporting a certain standard,\n\n41\n00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.514\nusing a certain frequency\nversus what kind of encryption.\n\n42\n00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:40.050\nSo I've got the access points\ninterface pulled up that we used\n\n43\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.450\nin the very first episode, or\nthe very first part here, and\n\n44\n00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.310\nI wanna kind of focus in on\nthe wireless aspect of this, right?\n\n45\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.740\nIf we go to the wireless settings, that\nlooks like my session time down here, so\n\n46\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.200\nlet's go ahead and\nuse our super secret password out there,\n\n47\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.340\nget logged back in here real quick.\n\n48\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.180\nAnd I wanna focus again in on\nthe wireless portion of this too,\n\n49\n00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.790\nbecause we talked mainly about wired,\nthe wired communication.\n\n50\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.990\nBut I want you to notice that,\n\n51\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190\nkeep in mind that frequency\nmismatches could be a problem, too.\n\n52\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.650\nIt's one of the reasons that\nwe wanna look at those 802.11\n\n53\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.320\nwireless local area network standards,\nbecause again A, B, G and,\n\n54\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.440\nif you will, and AC today,\nthey all support different frequencies.\n\n55\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.016\nAnd well,\n\n56\n00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:28.185\nlike N supports a couple of frequencies\ncuz it was a dual band communication.\n\n57\n00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:31.075\nBut if you have some of\nthe older standards, all right,\n\n58\n00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:33.842\nthat might run into a little\nbit of a problem, right,\n\n59\n00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:38.041\nespecially if you're supporting AC and\nit doesn't have a dual band radio in it.\n\n60\n00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.045\nAgain, meaning that it can\nalso support 2.4 as well as 5,\n\n61\n00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:45.516\ncuz remember the AC standard\nis the 5 GHz frequency.\n\n62\n00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:49.339\nBut because manufacturers want\nthis interoperability and\n\n63\n00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.162\ncompatibility, sometimes they will put,\nfor instance,\n\n64\n00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:58.295\nan M radio in there that will support\nall the earlier legacy protocols, right?\n\n65\n00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:02.069\nSo remember the earliest protocol,\none that's kinda gone by the wayside, but\n\n66\n00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.787\nwho knows, you might still\nsee it out there is A, right?\n\n67\n00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:07.392\nA works on the 5 GHz frequency but\n\n68\n00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:11.588\nwe have a lot of devices out\nthere that are also B and G.\n\n69\n00:03:11.588 --> 00:03:13.425\nB and G, and not N.\n\n70\n00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:19.408\nI say B and G only support 2.4, right,\nso this could be a problem as well.\n\n71\n00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:23.274\nNow the other thing I want you to keep\nin mind, too, is that the networks\n\n72\n00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:27.869\nhere could be set to an only-based network\nand it's exactly what it means, right?\n\n73\n00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.187\nIf I have a, let's say,\nan N device, right, but\n\n74\n00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:35.782\nI'm saying hey, I only wanna support G,\nwell, now have a problem.\n\n75\n00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.366\nI'm not gonna be able to communicate.\n\n76\n00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.910\nAnd even though they're\nin the same frequency,\n\n77\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.003\nsome of the things that you certainly\ndon't have to worry about for this exam,\n\n78\n00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:48.471\ncertain technologies use something known\nas direct sequence spread spectrum versus\n\n79\n00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:52.464\none that uses things like orthogonal\nfrequency divisional multiplexing.\n\n80\n00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:55.136\nAnd those are, again,\nyou don't have to worry so\n\n81\n00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:57.564\nmuch about the multiplexing technologies.\n\n82\n00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:01.481\nIt's just the fact that even though\nthey're operating in the same frequency,\n\n83\n00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:04.522\nthey might not be distributing\nthat information over the same\n\n84\n00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:07.400\nkind of technology,\nlet alone if you disable it, right?\n\n85\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.370\n[LAUGH] So that would cause issues, too,\nmight cause no connectivity likewise.\n\n86\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.510\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n87\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.112\nThat's one of the things,\nwhen we just talk about frequencies,\n\n88\n00:04:17.112 --> 00:04:18.355\nthat could cause the problem.\n\n89\n00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:23.050\nThe other thing that could cause the\nproblem, too, is your security modes here.\n\n90\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.279\nSo for instance, if you, well,\nwe really shouldn't be using WEP today,\n\n91\n00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.238\nbut if WEP is set up on here, and\nagain, it's even telling you, hey,\n\n92\n00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:35.163\nyou really don't wanna use WEP, so\nI'm not even gonna turn this on.\n\n93\n00:04:35.163 --> 00:04:39.596\nBut if we're gonna use\nsomething like WPA or WPA2,\n\n94\n00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:44.248\ndo you have things like\nthe right pass phrase, right?\n\n95\n00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:48.325\nWhen we talk about personal, guys, they\nlove to make these technical terms, and\n\n96\n00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:50.645\nin fact I know this is\none of Dan's pet peeves.\n\n97\n00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:51.938\nWe've talked about it before.\n\n98\n00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:54.170\nThey call it PSK, pre-shared key.\n\n99\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.127\nThey call it a phrase.\n\n100\n00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:56.057\nDan, what do you call it?\n\n101\n00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:57.027\n&gt;&gt; I call it a password.\n\n102\n00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.334\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n103\n00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:01.488\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what 95% of\nthe people out there using wireless\n\n104\n00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:03.623\ntechnologies are calling it, a password.\n\n105\n00:05:03.623 --> 00:05:08.100\nNot technical people, not IT folks like\nyou're trying to become or are, right?\n\n106\n00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.508\nYou're gonna start saying, well,\nthat's the pre-shared key,\n\n107\n00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:12.970\nbecause that's what they're\ngonna drill into your head.\n\n108\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.370\nBut for your average everyday Joe\nout there working on a computer,\n\n109\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.900\nbanging away at it,\npassword is what they're gonna call it.\n\n110\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.550\nPassphrase is what they're gonna call it.\n\n111\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.180\nAnd what's interesting is, you might have\nactually put in the correct password, and\n\n112\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.090\nnow it's not working.\n\n113\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.350\nWhy is it not working?\n\n114\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.485\nYour IT person may have changed\nthe password and you have yet\n\n115\n00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.249\nto update what that password is.\n\n116\n00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.185\nHence the reason it's\ntelling you no connectivity.\n\n117\n00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:35.838\n&gt;&gt; And you can see that, Dan,\nand I know you've done this,\n\n118\n00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:39.785\nDan's worked in help desk many, many years\nbefore, and why is he saying password?\n\n119\n00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:40.841\nBecause people understand it.\n\n120\n00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:44.636\nRemember another thing, and we talk about\nthis in the operational procedures and\n\n121\n00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:48.596\ncommunication, you're not doing yourself\nany justice like going into somebody and\n\n122\n00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:51.960\njust saying, hey, look how smart I am\nby saying a whole bunch of jargon.\n\n123\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.915\nWell, did you change the PSK?\n\n124\n00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:54.610\nWhat is that?\n\n125\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.103\nDid you type the right password?\n\n126\n00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.406\nNow I know what it is.\n\n127\n00:05:57.406 --> 00:06:00.959\nOkay, so understand that those terms\nare synonymous with each other, right?\n\n128\n00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:03.376\nAnd yes, you have to know the jargon for\nthe exam.\n\n129\n00:06:03.376 --> 00:06:06.885\nBut keep in mind, your jargon doesn't\na lot of times communicate when it comes\n\n130\n00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:08.062\nto just basic level help.\n\n131\n00:06:08.062 --> 00:06:11.728\nSo encryption mismatch could\nbe the problem as well.\n\n132\n00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:15.718\nIf you happen to be using something like\nWPS, where it's just a PIN that you enter,\n\n133\n00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:17.485\nright, did you enter the PIN right,\n\n134\n00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:21.549\nthe Personal Identification Number that's\non the back of the router, if you will?\n\n135\n00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:23.350\nAgain that could cause a problem.\n\n136\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.524\nOne of the last things\nI wanna say as well,\n\n137\n00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:28.643\nis that you can also do things\nlike wireless MAC filtering.\n\n138\n00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:32.568\nAnd this is either what's known\nas a white list or a black list.\n\n139\n00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:36.015\nA white list, if you will, says,\nhey, anything that's on this list,\n\n140\n00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:37.553\nwe're gonna allow it, right?\n\n141\n00:06:37.553 --> 00:06:40.481\nThe black list is kind of like a, hey,\nI got you in that little black book.\n\n142\n00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:41.318\nWe're gonna take you out.\n\n143\n00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:45.447\n[LAUGH] No, the black list says no,\nyou're not permitted, right?\n\n144\n00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:48.021\nAnd people can do this for\ndifferent reasons, right, or\n\n145\n00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.693\nimplement it differently, right?\n\n146\n00:06:49.693 --> 00:06:52.392\nSo regardless of which\nside of the tracks it is,\n\n147\n00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:56.114\nif it happens to be a prevent versus\na permit, are you on the list?\n\n148\n00:06:56.114 --> 00:06:58.739\nAnd if you're on the list and\nyou're prevented, well,\n\n149\n00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:00.555\nthat means you're not gonna connect.\n\n150\n00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:03.721\nWhen you go to do the association\nstuff with the access point and\n\n151\n00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:07.664\nthat communication and negotiate it,\nit's gonna look at your MAC address and\n\n152\n00:07:07.664 --> 00:07:09.653\nit's gonna say, no, no food for you.\n\n153\n00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:11.978\nYou don't get to sit\ndown at the restaurant.\n\n154\n00:07:11.978 --> 00:07:12.571\nOkay, so\n\n155\n00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:17.706\nthat could be no connectivity that's\ndirectly related to things like wireless.\n\n156\n00:07:17.706 --> 00:07:22.128\nNow on the MAC filtering side,\nI have a disagreement.\n\n157\n00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:24.955\nA lot of times you'll see it associated\nwith a wireless communication.\n\n158\n00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:28.205\nThat isn't just a wireless\ncommunication technology.\n\n159\n00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:32.045\nAs you guys will go learn, as those of\nyou that go on into things like Cisco and\n\n160\n00:07:32.045 --> 00:07:34.335\nstuff, you'll learn that that's\nhow they do port security.\n\n161\n00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:36.195\nThey can do the same thing\nin a wired switch and say,\n\n162\n00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:40.500\nhey, I know what computer should be\nsending information into this port,\n\n163\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.550\nso technically it can be a wired thing,\ntoo.\n\n164\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.937\nSo that's some of the things that we can\nsee with no connectivity, all right?\n\n165\n00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:48.020\nAnd I know that's a lot, guys, but\n\n166\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.504\nthere are a lot of things that\ncould cause no connectivity.\n\n167\n00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.433\nThey also call out APIPA,\nthe automatic private IP address,\n\n168\n00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.347\nand we kinda touched base Based on that,\n\n169\n00:07:56.347 --> 00:08:00.143\nin the last episode, when we talked about\nthe HCP, remember the door process.\n\n170\n00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:03.371\nRemember that when my computer\nconnects to a local network, and\n\n171\n00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:06.011\nif it's set to obtain an IP\naddress automatically.\n\n172\n00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:10.480\nIt's gonna call out to the network, and\nit's gonna try to discover an IP address.\n\n173\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.180\nIf it doesn't hear an offer\ncome back from any DHCP server,\n\n174\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.880\nit falls back on\nthe 169.254.anything.anything address.\n\n175\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.840\nRemember, the last two\noctets gives it 65,535 or\n\n176\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.920\n34 possibilities, and\nit dynamically generates that.\n\n177\n00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.606\nThat could be an issue.\n\n178\n00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:33.090\nNow, I also mention link\nlocal address as well.\n\n179\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.013\nAnd said that the computer's always\ngonna link local address, but\n\n180\n00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:37.920\nthis might cause a problem\non your network.\n\n181\n00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.230\nAnd it's not so much that the link local\naddress itself is causing a problem.\n\n182\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.100\nIf you have an ISP that\ndoesn't support IPv6, and\n\n183\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.040\nyou need to make an IPv6 communication\nover a public network, well, guess what?\n\n184\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.850\nIf you don't have that IPv6 communication,\nand you see that you only have the link\n\n185\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.710\nlocal, you can only communicate\non your local network, right.\n\n186\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.000\nSo that might be another\nsituation in which that happens.\n\n187\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.780\nLet's see, other things that I wanted to\ntalk about that we've already mentioned,\n\n188\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.580\nis the fact that the access\npoint itself might be failing.\n\n189\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.130\nThat could give you an APIPA address,\nyou're set to dynamically obtain one.\n\n190\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.740\nIt sees that it's got a connection,\nbut for whatever reason,\n\n191\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.350\nit can't offer you that IP address.\n\n192\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.410\nThat also could be one, as well.\n\n193\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.830\nNow the other thing we also have\nto keep in mind too is that they\n\n194\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.040\ncall that limited connectivity.\n\n195\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.782\nAll right now, in limited connectivity,\nthis could be a few different things,\n\n196\n00:09:27.782 --> 00:09:28.399\nas well, right?\n\n197\n00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:32.459\nThis could be the fact that you don't\nhave a DHCP server offering a service.\n\n198\n00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:34.459\nAnd when you have an APIPA address,\n\n199\n00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:39.270\nyou are limited to communicating only with\nthe devices that also have APIPA address.\n\n200\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.420\nJust because you have an APIPA address,\n\n201\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.670\ndoesn't mean that the normal\nnetworking rules apply.\n\n202\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.370\nYou have to be on the same network, and\n\n203\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.740\nyou have to be uniquely\nidentified on that network.\n\n204\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.960\nIf you're the only computer that is\non the APIPA network, guess what?\n\n205\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.070\nYou're sitting in a boat alone, and you're\nrowing against the tide by yourself.\n\n206\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.090\nThere's nobody else you\ncan communicate with, and\n\n207\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.510\nthat's important to keep in mind.\n\n208\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.650\nAPIPAs can give you limited connectivity,\nas well.\n\n209\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.981\nOther limited connectivity can be\nan outage with your ISP, right.\n\n210\n00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:10.429\nIf the ISP, we live in Florida,\nwe have to deal every day,\n\n211\n00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:16.117\nand almost every single day,\nwith our rain delays, right.\n\n212\n00:10:16.117 --> 00:10:20.077\nWell, if your ISP loses Internet\nconnectivity or somebody hits,\n\n213\n00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:23.340\ngets in the crash or\nsomething goes wrong with the ISP.\n\n214\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.391\nYou can communicate within\nyour local networks, but\n\n215\n00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:29.470\nyou cannot communicate\noutbound via the Internet.\n\n216\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.270\n&gt;&gt; My favorite is when construction\nworkers cut through the fiber\n\n217\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.020\noptic backbone.\n\n218\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.940\nThat's always fun [LAUGH].\n\n219\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.030\n&gt;&gt; You know what,\nI don't care what they said.\n\n220\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.710\nIt wasn't me with the backhoe,\n[LAUGH] and that's right.\n\n221\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.440\nSo let's go ahead, and what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna look at the computer that\n\n222\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.695\nwe've been dealing with here for\na while now, since the first episode.\n\n223\n00:10:44.695 --> 00:10:48.530\nAnd notice that we do have connectivity,\nright?\n\n224\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.880\nSo with limited connectivity,\nit's one of those things that, again,\n\n225\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.550\nI can see that I have link\nlights on the adapter, right?\n\n226\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.600\nBut, I could have limited connectivity\ninside of the Operating System.\n\n227\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.120\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwhat we're gonna do is we'll look at\n\n228\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.990\nthe desktop of this computer, and\nsee if we have limited connectivity.\n\n229\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.502\nYeah Dan, so you can see here if I kind\nof zoom in, we kind of have this, and\n\n230\n00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.569\nin this case, it says no Internet access.\n\n231\n00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:13.646\nIt could say limited connectivity too,\n\n232\n00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:17.260\nbecause sometimes you can't even\nconnect outbound even to your ISP.\n\n233\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.383\nYou can reach an external DNS server, and\nin that case, it says no Internet access.\n\n234\n00:11:21.383 --> 00:11:25.165\nSometimes you can reach the ISP,\nand like we've said, somebody can,\n\n235\n00:11:25.165 --> 00:11:27.740\nyou've mentioned construction, right?\n\n236\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.560\nSomebody digs up the ISP's fiber optic\nconnector, so that means you can still\n\n237\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.910\nconnect to the ISP, but\nyou can't go any farther past that.\n\n238\n00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.987\nThat would give you a limited\nconnectivity situation.\n\n239\n00:11:37.987 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo either, or, they manifest\nthemselves pretty much in the same way.\n\n240\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.509\nAnd the fact that you get that little,\nas you can see there,\n\n241\n00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:49.990\nthe little warning symbol with the\ntriangle, right, exclamation point there.\n\n242\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.260\nSo, that's one of the ways that you\ncould get the limited connectivity.\n\n243\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.590\nNow, the next thing that they talk about,\n\n244\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.260\nthey call out as what's\nknown as local connectivity.\n\n245\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.710\nAnd what they mean by that is,\nI can communicate on my local network.\n\n246\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.910\nBut what I can't do is communicate\noff of my local network.\n\n247\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.200\nAnd there are a couple ways that you can\nkinda see that this is happening, and\n\n248\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.600\nyou can also troubleshoot it, as well.\n\n249\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.060\nSo, if we dive back into that computer\nhere, let me go ahead and what I'm gonna\n\n250\n00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.000\ndo is I'm gonna right click on our network\nadapter that we've been working with and\n\n251\n00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.400\nI'm gonna choose Status.\n\n252\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.060\nAnd then I'm gonna choose Details here.\n\n253\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.760\nAnd when I choose Details, all right,\nthere is an important component\n\n254\n00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.081\nwithin your IPv4 information that\nyou just have to have, right?\n\n255\n00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:40.240\nAnd what I'm specifically looking for\nhere is, where is it, the Default Gateway.\n\n256\n00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.190\nNotice it says IPv4 Default Gateway.\n\n257\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.810\nIf that number is blank, right,\nthat IP address isn't there.\n\n258\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.607\nIt means you have no place\nto send the information,\n\n259\n00:12:49.607 --> 00:12:52.872\nso that it can be carried off\nof your local network, right?\n\n260\n00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:55.556\nRemember, the default\ngateway is that device,\n\n261\n00:12:55.556 --> 00:12:58.314\nmore specifically the IP\naddress of that device.\n\n262\n00:12:58.314 --> 00:13:03.230\nThat can pass information off your local\nnetwork to another remote network.\n\n263\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.220\nAnd if the IP address is missing or\n\n264\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.710\nincorrect, then you're not\ngonna be able to send it.\n\n265\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.821\nNow, it could be a faulty access point,\nlike for\n\n266\n00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:14.028\ninstance, our default gateway here\njust happens to be the access point.\n\n267\n00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:18.350\nNow the other thing, too, is that this\naccess point doesn't have outbound\n\n268\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.960\nconnectivity to, well,\nthe Internet, right?\n\n269\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.050\nCould be the fact that the cable's\nnot plugged into the modem.\n\n270\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.892\nCould be the fact that you have a modem,\nand the modem's turned off,\n\n271\n00:13:26.892 --> 00:13:28.240\nthe modem lost power.\n\n272\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.900\nThis could also do that, too.\n\n273\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.680\nBut you could also test that with\na utility that I've kind of mentioned just\n\n274\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.548\nbriefly, and that's called Ping.\n\n275\n00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:40.209\nThat's the packet Internet groper, and\nit allows you to test communications\n\n276\n00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:43.120\nbetween two end points on\na TCIPIP base network.\n\n277\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.290\nSo, we large up our command prompt here,\nand we will clear the screen out there.\n\n278\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.110\nI can Ping, send a little bit\nof information to an end point.\n\n279\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.585\nNow, what's important for\nus here is to understand that,\n\n280\n00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.965\nif we're gonna use the Ping utility,\nwe have to use it the right way.\n\n281\n00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:02.945\nAnd the way that you use it is first\ntesting the Operating System's ability\n\n282\n00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:07.220\nto communicate with that suite\nof protocols we call TCPIP.\n\n283\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.850\nAnd how do we do that?\n\n284\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.430\nWe do that by running Ping,\n\n285\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.830\nand then pinging an address,\nkind of a universal address, if you will.\n\n286\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.180\nIt's called the loopback address.\n\n287\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.800\nThe loopback address is just\na software based logical address.\n\n288\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.370\nIt just resides inside of the TCPIP\nprotocol stack that we use to see\n\n289\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.720\nif the software knows\nthe language of TCPIP.\n\n290\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.620\nNow, you see that it's returning\nreplies and that let's me know, hey,\n\n291\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.500\nthe Operating System knows what TCPIP is,\nand it can speak that language.\n\n292\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.460\nNow, the next thing we have to do as\nwe're trying to figure out where this\n\n293\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.100\nlocal connectivity breakdown is,\nis we're going to the edge of our network.\n\n294\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.080\nSo the next step in the process would\nbe to ping the network adapter.\n\n295\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.576\nSee can it respond when it's called on,\nand\n\n296\n00:14:50.576 --> 00:14:55.410\nyou can always find your IP\naddress by running the ipconfig.\n\n297\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.706\nYou can run it just by itself,\nor you can always,\n\n298\n00:14:57.706 --> 00:14:59.620\nif you want more detailed information.\n\n299\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.020\nYou can add the l to it, and\nit gives you a lot more information there.\n\n300\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.560\nBut, notice that I spy my IP address right\nhere, right, I can see 192.168.1.20.\n\n301\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:15.160\nLet's find out if the adapter does\nknow how to respond to itself.\n\n302\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.395\nSo what we'll do is we'll run a ping,\n\n303\n00:15:19.395 --> 00:15:23.180\n192.168.1.128, and\nwe'll see if it'll return replies.\n\n304\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.540\nNow it's returning replies, right?\n\n305\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.610\nThat's a good thing.\n\n306\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.883\nAnd that means that\nthe adapter is communicating.\n\n307\n00:15:28.883 --> 00:15:32.271\nNow, the next thing that you would wanna\ndo is you wanna ping another device within\n\n308\n00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:32.920\nyour network.\n\n309\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.040\nTo see, hey can I communicate like,\nI know Dan is sitting in studio two here,\n\n310\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.255\ncan I talk to Dan, and\nDan talk back to me, if you will?\n\n311\n00:15:40.255 --> 00:15:43.440\nRight, so you ping something\nlocally on your network, right.\n\n312\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.970\nAgain, you're working your way\nto the edge of the network.\n\n313\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.391\nThe next thing you do is you\nping the default gateway.\n\n314\n00:15:48.391 --> 00:15:50.471\nCan I send information to begin with,\n\n315\n00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:54.311\nto the device that's gonna pass that\ninformation off to the network?\n\n316\n00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:57.826\nAnd in this case it is 192.168.1.1.\n\n317\n00:15:57.826 --> 00:16:01.240\nSo that's what we'll do,\nwe'll run a ping of 192,\n\n318\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.350\nlet me make sure I put a space in there,\n192.168.1.1.\n\n319\n00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.690\nAnd if I get replies there at this point,\n\n320\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:14.750\nI know I can communicate within my\ncomputer, my adapter can communicate,\n\n321\n00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.950\nI can communicate with\nanother device on my network.\n\n322\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.360\nAnd I can even talk to the doorway,\nor in this case,\n\n323\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.210\nthe gateway,\nthat leads me off of my network.\n\n324\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.630\nNow, don't stop there.\n\n325\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.520\nThe last thing to test, whether you have\nonly local connectivity versus, let's say,\n\n326\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.870\nInternet connectivity, is to ping\na device that is off of your network.\n\n327\n00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.270\nAnd there are many different IP\naddresses that you can find out there\n\n328\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.760\nto ping if you want.\n\n329\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.120\nSome of the ones that we use here,\n\n330\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.240\nGoogle's got a DNS server that's\npublically accessible via ping.\n\n331\n00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.968\nSo you can ping things like 8.8.8.8.\n\n332\n00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:50.725\nYou can ping 8.8.4.4,\nagain that's another one of theirs.\n\n333\n00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:51.824\nThere's a bunch of them out there.\n\n334\n00:16:51.824 --> 00:16:53.560\nThese are some of the ones that I use.\n\n335\n00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.520\nAnd if I ping this, notice it says\ndestination it's unreachable.\n\n336\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.660\nSo now I know that I could get\nto the edge of my network, but\n\n337\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.130\nthe problem is I can't\nget past my network.\n\n338\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.120\nSo now it's up to me to figure out,\nis it the access\n\n339\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.270\npoint that's causing the problem?\n\n340\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:14.260\nCuz the access point might not have\nconnected to the ISP, all right?\n\n341\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.140\nAnd if it hasn't connected to the ISP,\nunfortunately,\n\n342\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.560\nthere's really no way we're\ngonna be able to communicate.\n\n343\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.310\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe additional settings that you\n\n344\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:23.900\nneed to look at.\n\n345\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.610\nIn fact, we can always tell whether\nour access point is connected,\n\n346\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.740\nif you will, to the ISP.\n\n347\n00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.330\nSo the next thing that we're gonna look at\nis the interface to the access point to\n\n348\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.620\nfind out, is that the reason I\ncan't connect off of my network and\n\n349\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.340\nonly have local connectivity?\n\n350\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.540\nI don't know, we'll find out.\n\n351\n00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.150\nAnd ladies and gentleman, one of\nthe ways that we can tell that really\n\n352\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.140\nare a couple different locations,\nfor instance, in our Linksys here,\n\n353\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.850\nbecause you'll see that it asks\nus what is our Internet type.\n\n354\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.040\nAnd depending on what kind of,\nagain connection type,\n\n355\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.450\nor what you're trying to accomplish, you\nmight have different connection types and\n\n356\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.300\nI'll show you here in\na second what I mean.\n\n357\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.120\nMost often if you're connecting to\nyour Internet service provider,\n\n358\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.130\nyou're gonna leave this as a DHCP.\n\n359\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.180\nCuz what they're doing is when your\ncomputer connects to their network,\n\n360\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.950\nit's really their DHCP server\nthat's giving you an IP address.\n\n361\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.610\nAnd a lot of times it picks\nup the same IP address.\n\n362\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.830\nBut it is subject to change, right?\n\n363\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.990\nThere might be other things that you're\ndoing here that go well beyond the scope\n\n364\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.810\nof this exam.\n\n365\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.800\nYou might be doing VPN communications and\nstuff.\n\n366\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.730\nWe're not going to worry about that,\ntoo, so.\n\n367\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.410\nBut I would pay attention to that part,\n\n368\n00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.400\nis that the Internet connection type\nis set to an automatic configuration.\n\n369\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.760\nAnd, by default, a lot of times it is,\nespecially within your home devices.\n\n370\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.231\nThe other way is that right here, for\ninstance, in WRT interface, again,\n\n371\n00:18:41.231 --> 00:18:44.105\nslightly different,\nlike I have an ASUS router at my house, so\n\n372\n00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:45.482\nit is a little bit different.\n\n373\n00:18:45.482 --> 00:18:49.103\nBut for the most part across the top of\nthese, a lot of times they are the same.\n\n374\n00:18:49.103 --> 00:18:50.935\nSo, for instance,\nI have the Status option.\n\n375\n00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:55.175\nAnd if I look at Status, one of the things\nI can see is the router's information like\n\n376\n00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:57.065\nits Internet MAC address.\n\n377\n00:18:57.065 --> 00:19:00.225\nThis is what your ISP will see\nwhen the access point connects.\n\n378\n00:19:00.225 --> 00:19:01.995\nI can see firmware version as well.\n\n379\n00:19:01.995 --> 00:19:06.325\nBut what I really want to know\nis my Internet connection.\n\n380\n00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:08.345\nWe've set it to an automatic\nInternet connection.\n\n381\n00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:10.938\nAnd you can kinda see that\nwith the connection type here,\n\n382\n00:19:10.938 --> 00:19:13.080\nAutomatic Configuration-DHCP.\n\n383\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.410\nBut notice that I don't\nhave an IP address, right?\n\n384\n00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.420\nI don't have an Internet IP address,\n\n385\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.480\nI don't have an Internet-based subnet mask\nor default gateway, let alone DNS servers.\n\n386\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.510\nAnd again, that's your ISP doing the same\nthing that your client does when it\n\n387\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.010\nconnects to the network.\n\n388\n00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.150\nYou do that outbound on the WAN side\nof your communications when your access\n\n389\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.650\npoint goes through your modem to\nconnect to the ISP, it basically says,\n\n390\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.940\nhey, ISP I paid you some money,\nyou got an ISP address for me?\n\n391\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.255\nAnd if they're having issues or the bill\nisn't paid, you're going to see this right\n\n392\n00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:49.685\nhere and what that does is it will\nresult in limited or local connectivity.\n\n393\n00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:52.665\nYou won't be able to communicate\noutside of your network.\n\n394\n00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:56.815\nNow the other thing that can\ncause problems too is when\n\n395\n00:19:56.815 --> 00:19:58.875\nyou have IP conflicts.\n\n396\n00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:03.170\nNow IP conflicts typically\nare a configuration issue, if you will.\n\n397\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:08.100\nAnd with the configuration issue,\nsometimes here's what can happen.\n\n398\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.030\nYou set your computer up for\nDHCP, all right?\n\n399\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.540\nYou set a computer up or a printer or\nsomething like that up on your network,\n\n400\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.980\nand a lot of times they like static IPs,\nwe talked about in TCPIP that certain\n\n401\n00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.770\nservices you never want then\nto change their IP address.\n\n402\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.420\nIf we go back to the access point,\nlet me show you where you can kind of get\n\n403\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.175\nyourself into trouble with this\none pretty quickly, right?\n\n404\n00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:35.000\n[LAUGH] When you are setting up DHCP,\nwe're talking about getting\n\n405\n00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.570\nthose IP addresses pulled\ndown to your local machine.\n\n406\n00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:43.480\nWell, if you've statically mapped an IP\naddress and it sits within this range,\n\n407\n00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.670\nthere is a potential for\n\n408\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.960\none of those IP addresses to be\nissued out by the DHCP service.\n\n409\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.240\nSo let's just say theoretically, I've got\na printer within my network that I've\n\n410\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.410\nstatically mapped or manually configured\nits IP address to 192.168.1.101,\n\n411\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.470\nand my computer connects to the network.\n\n412\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.810\nAnd it says, I need an IP address,\nand DHCP says,\n\n413\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.540\nwell, here's the list of IPs I have here,\nyou can have .101.\n\n414\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.400\nNow we've got two computers\non the network that,\n\n415\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.370\nlike the house on the same street\nhas identical house numbers, mail\n\n416\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.320\ncarrier gets there and says, wait a second\nwhich mail box does this go to, right?\n\n417\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.800\nAnd we have a conflict.\n\n418\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.980\nSo that can happen and\none of the things that you can do, I said,\n\n419\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.360\nthat's where you can get into trouble.\n\n420\n00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.950\nHere's where you can kind of\nalleviate that problem, well,\n\n421\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.320\nyou've a couple of options,\nI can make sure,\n\n422\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.730\noops, that you guys take your motion\nsickness pills after I get done [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.970\nI can make sure that whatever the static\nIP address is, it can be like .99, or\n\n424\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.720\nit can be like .150,\nsee how it sits outside of that range?\n\n425\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.060\nOr we can go even further, we can set\nup what's known as a DHCP reservation.\n\n426\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.340\nAnd when you set up a DHCP reservation,\nessentially what you're saying is every\n\n427\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.690\ntime that computer turns on, or\na printer turns on, it says, I\n\n428\n00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.320\nrecognize that device and yes I know it's\nwithin this list, but I've bookmarked it.\n\n429\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.220\nThat it's only gonna\ngo to this one device.\n\n430\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.800\nThat's why they call it a reservation,\nright?\n\n431\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.455\nIt's like assigning\nreservations at a restaurant.\n\n432\n00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:16.340\nDan, you take your wife out, I take my\nwife out, if you will, to restaurant.\n\n433\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.300\nWe make a reservation,\nwhat are they doing?\n\n434\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.350\nThey're saying this table at this\ntime is gonna be reserved for you.\n\n435\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.750\nIt's the same thing with your IP address.\n\n436\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.823\nWhat you're saying is within that range,\nI'm gonna take one of these IP addresses.\n\n437\n00:22:26.823 --> 00:22:30.172\nI'm gonna bookmark it, and that's\ngonna be, let's say, for that printer.\n\n438\n00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:33.678\nAnd every time that printer turns on,\nand calls out to the network,\n\n439\n00:22:33.678 --> 00:22:37.570\nI'm gonna make sure I only give\nthat printer that IP address.\n\n440\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.960\nThe other thing is too, is if you're\nstatically mapping IP addresses,\n\n441\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.250\njust map it outside of the range.\n\n442\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.210\nSo, couple of different things, Dan,\nwe can see, especially when it comes to IP\n\n443\n00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.000\nconflicts, a lot of times IP conflicts\nare just really nothing more than\n\n444\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.380\na misconfiguration of the IP\naddresses on the network adapters.\n\n445\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Wes, I know you got\na few more little tidbits, odds and\n\n446\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.390\nends that we've got to go through when\nit comes to network connectivity issues.\n\n447\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.460\nBut our clock is screaming\nthat we are out of time.\n\n448\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.580\nSo we'll just have to\nmake a short part three.\n\n449\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.340\nSo join us for that part three,\nit'll be a lot of fun.\n\n450\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.540\nAs for this episode, though,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n451\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.030\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n452\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:09.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n453\n00:23:09.870 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:16.300\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone welcome\nback to another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.500\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and I hope\nyou're just as excited as I am because\n\n5\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.450\ntoday we're continuing on\nwith more in our A+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.690\nAnd joining us back again to b e\nas excited as we are, hopefully,\n\n7\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.550\nis our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.730\nWes, how's it going, man?\n\n9\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.720\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.709\nYeah, this is gonna be another good\nepisode in our mini-series on network\n\n11\n00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.240\ntroubleshooting, right?\n\n12\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.430\nWe've been talking about wired and\nwireless.\n\n13\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.940\nAnd some of the things\nthat you can encounter and\n\n14\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.730\nthere are just a handful of things\nthat we kinda wanna wrap up here.\n\n15\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.390\nSo this might not be a very\nthorough episode, but\n\n16\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.710\nit's definitely gonna be full of a lot\nof great content regardless, so.\n\n17\n00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.620\n&gt;&gt; It'll be full of something.\n\n18\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.750\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be full something that's for\nsure, that's right.\n\n19\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.560\nLet's hope it's something that you guys\nwanna stick around for, that's right.\n\n20\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.680\nSo one of the things that\nthey've also talked about\n\n21\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.500\nwhen it comes to some of the symptoms\nyou can get inside of wired and\n\n22\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.370\nwireless networks, really,\nis slow transfer speeds, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.410\nWhen we talk about network,\nremember, networks are here for\n\n24\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.250\ntwo reasons, communication and\nthen sharing resources.\n\n25\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.195\nAnd one of the things that we\ndo from time to time on networks\n\n26\n00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:18.920\nare share things like files, we transfer\ninformation from one computer to another.\n\n27\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.030\nAnd sometimes those file transfers,\n\n28\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.180\nif you will, or transfers in general,\nslow transfer speeds can happen.\n\n29\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.880\nNow there is a few things\nthat might cause this, right?\n\n30\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.900\nThe device, let's say, you've got a\nnetwork device out there, it's got a hard\n\n31\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.330\ndrive and that hard drive is starting to\nfill up, and we're really full, right?\n\n32\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.060\nWell, understand that the operating\nsystem, whether you're\n\n33\n00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.940\ntransferring files or not, is constantly\nusing your hard drive, right?\n\n34\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.890\nWe have what are known as page file,\nswap files, that we talked about in 902.\n\n35\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.890\nThat allow us to use portions\nof our hard drive as memory and\n\n36\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.640\nyour operating system is\nconstantly using that, right?\n\n37\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.250\nWhen you talk about things like sending\ninformation to network-based printers.\n\n38\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.340\nIf the device is a printer that's\nconnected to another machine and\n\n39\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.450\nthat drive is full, you might start to see\nsome performance issues there as well.\n\n40\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.890\nSo it could be the fact\nthat the storage media is,\n\n41\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370\nmaybe the storage media is\nusing old standards too.\n\n42\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.450\nThat could cause a problem too.\n\n43\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.120\nYou're cabling could be another thing,\nstandards, right?\n\n44\n00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.382\nWe try to shy away from CAT 3 today just\nbecause of its limited bandwidth, right?\n\n45\n00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:20.430\nYou wanna, really today, you almost\nwanna go with nothing less than CAT 5E.\n\n46\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.660\nI know a lot of people say, well,\nIf I'm gonna install new cabling,\n\n47\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.980\nI'm pretty much gonna go with CAT 6 or\nabove, and it does get expensive.\n\n48\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.640\nBut it could be a standards, the standard\ncould be causing the problem too.\n\n49\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.480\nYou could have limited bandwidth,\nyou could have a lot of devices.\n\n50\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.370\nAs well,\ngoing along with that mindset is that you\n\n51\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.480\nhave a lot of high definition video that's\ntraveling your networks, and guess what?\n\n52\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.710\nYou need some bandwidth, right?\n\n53\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.310\nThat takes a lot of that\ntheoretical pipeline, if you will,\n\n54\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.050\nto send information through it.\n\n55\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.710\nAnd if you have a lot of devices that are\non your network all doing that at the same\n\n56\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.185\ntime, then you'll have\nbandwidth contention, right?\n\n57\n00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:58.530\nCuz keep in mind,\nwhen you're talking about on the network,\n\n58\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.440\nit is shared bandwidth.\n\n59\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.570\nAnd too many devices, again,\ncan cause a little bit of contention.\n\n60\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.930\nThe other thing that you could have, too,\nand this is not quite as common, but\n\n61\n00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.650\ncould happen, is duplex mismatches, right?\n\n62\n00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.660\nWe have a few different types of\nduplexing technologies, right?\n\n63\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.280\nDuplexing is, can I send and\nreceive information at the same time?\n\n64\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.300\nWell, if I can send and\nreceive information at the same time,\n\n65\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.830\nthat's called full duplex.\n\n66\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.310\nAnd that's what most of your modern\nnetworks for a long time have been,\n\n67\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.940\nfull duplex.\n\n68\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.620\nI can send information\nto Dan's computer as\n\n69\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.620\nwell as Dan can send information to my\ncomputer, we can do that simultaneously.\n\n70\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.950\nIn the earlier days when we\nwere using things like hubs,\n\n71\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.140\nthis is another one of the reasons\nyou don't want hubs for\n\n72\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.240\nnetworking devices is that\nthey were half duplex, right?\n\n73\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.230\nThink about what we said in\ntheir characteristics of TCP/IP\n\n74\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.270\nwhen it comes to hubs, right?\n\n75\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.810\nA hub when you send communications into\nit, it basically broadcasts at all ports.\n\n76\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.700\nWhich means that if I'm\ncommunicating with the hub,\n\n77\n00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.550\nDan's computer has to wait until I'm\ndone talking in order to communicate.\n\n78\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.320\nThat's a half duplex communication,\nand it causes slow transfer speed.\n\n79\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.910\nHowever, we usually don't have\nthat problem today, again,\n\n80\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.810\nbecause the majority of the time\nwe are configured for full duplex.\n\n81\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.640\nAnd a lot of times it's auto negotiated,\nwhich means when my computer connects to\n\n82\n00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.810\nthe network, it talks to the connectivity\ndevice and says, what are you running?\n\n83\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.920\nWell, I'm running a gigabyte speed,\nI'm running it full duplex and\n\n84\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.180\nI'll go ahead and configure that adapter,\nthe operating system for you.\n\n85\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.290\nProximity of its wireless,\nit could be proximity of the access point.\n\n86\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.090\nAgain, the farther away you get\nfrom the range of the access point,\n\n87\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.680\nthe slower the performance could be.\n\n88\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.790\nIt could also be things like obstacles in\nthe way, wireless communication, while not\n\n89\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.544\nreally needing to be a completely\ndirect line of sight with Wi-Fi,\n\n90\n00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:44.800\nit doesn't do too well when we talk\nabout walls in the way, right?\n\n91\n00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.320\nThat could affect performance too.\n\n92\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.800\nIt could be things like\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n93\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.240\nRadio frequency interference\ncould cause problems, right?\n\n94\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.190\nAnd really when you talk about\nelectromagnetic interference,\n\n95\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.330\nwe're talking about effects\nwith wired cabling too, right?\n\n96\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.290\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n97\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.760\nWell, it's really easy to get a little bit\nlazy when it comes to wiring your network.\n\n98\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.292\nAnd because you already got an electrical\noutlet, well, you know that that cable,\n\n99\n00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.345\nthat conduit,\nit's running through the wall.\n\n100\n00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:12.761\nSo, let's just go ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:16.725\nlet's put our Ethernet cable right\nnext to the electrical conduit.\n\n102\n00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:19.535\nWell, that can cause electromagnetic\ninterference, right?\n\n103\n00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:23.445\nThat crosstalk, that bleed over\nthe electromagnetic energy from\n\n104\n00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:26.605\nthe AC source into your\nnetwork communications.\n\n105\n00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:29.335\nThe other thing that cause that as well\nis if you're running things, like for\n\n106\n00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:31.655\ninstance, maybe you got some\nhigh intensity discharge lamps.\n\n107\n00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:36.150\nYou've got the fluorescent bulb inside\nyour home, you've got a drop ceiling if\n\n108\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.060\nyou're in a business,\nyou've got all fluorescent lamps.\n\n109\n00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.240\nFluorescent light give off an extremely\nhigh amount of electromagnetic energy and\n\n110\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.590\nthey also can affect data transmission.\n\n111\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.540\nSo keep in mind that could\nslow things down too.\n\n112\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.460\nAnd then notice I saved this one for last\nbecause I think, Dan, you mentioned this\n\n113\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.500\nin an earlier episode, we always want\nto call this one out first, right?\n\n114\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.740\nMalware, but we can over look it, right?\n\n115\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.190\nSlow transfer speeds could be malware.\n\n116\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.360\nYou could have some kind of worm on your\nnetwork that's replicating itself across\n\n117\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.800\nall of the different devices within your\nnetwork, consuming your resources, and\n\n118\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.690\nreally slowing things down and\ncausing havoc, right?\n\n119\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's never a fun time.\n\n120\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.760\nI've had many of help desk call\nwhere someone says, my computer is\n\n121\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.340\nrunning slowly, I'm like, well,\nis it your computer that's running slowly?\n\n122\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.234\nIs it your network connectivity\nthat's running slowly?\n\n123\n00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:23.876\nAnd you come to find out that usually\nit's both if it comes to malware,\n\n124\n00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:25.729\ncuz it is just hogging resources and\n\n125\n00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.273\nslamming your network home because\nit's phoning home somewhere.\n\n126\n00:06:29.273 --> 00:06:30.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n127\n00:06:30.162 --> 00:06:31.752\nAnd that's what it seeks to do, right?\n\n128\n00:06:31.752 --> 00:06:34.243\nConsume anything it can and\neverything it can, and it will.\n\n129\n00:06:34.243 --> 00:06:34.932\n&gt;&gt; It's the devil.\n\n130\n00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:36.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It really is.\n\n131\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.010\nAnd, we've gotta watch them, right?\n\n132\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.172\nBecause as you'll learn when we talk about\nsecurity, a worm is a self-replicating,\n\n133\n00:06:42.172 --> 00:06:45.944\nself-generated type piece of code\nthat's self-sufficient, if you will.\n\n134\n00:06:45.944 --> 00:06:48.671\nIt just needs a port of entry,\nit doesn't need a host like a virus does.\n\n135\n00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.385\nBut it could be viruses as well.\n\n136\n00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:53.695\nNow, the other thing they\ncall out is low RF signal.\n\n137\n00:06:53.695 --> 00:06:57.485\nLow RF signal also can manifest itself\nin slow transfer speeds and can be\n\n138\n00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:01.835\nintermittent connectivity as well as poor\nperformance within your wireless networks.\n\n139\n00:07:01.835 --> 00:07:06.660\nNow, when we say low radio frequency\nsignal, you might have the wrong antenna.\n\n140\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.180\nYou might have a non-directional antenna,\nomnidirectional antenna,\n\n141\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.770\nthat is actually being blocked.\n\n142\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.350\nYou might have to change antenna types.\n\n143\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.380\nYou might have to change\nthe gain of the antenna itself.\n\n144\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.679\nGain is the antenna strength, if you will.\n\n145\n00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.939\nAnd that could be a problem.\n\n146\n00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.706\nCould be proximity of the access point\nas well as obstacles in between you and\n\n147\n00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:31.940\nwhatever the transmitter is on the back\nof the connectivity device, right?\n\n148\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.670\nThe other thing too,\nyou just could have limited bandwidth.\n\n149\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.850\nYou might have too many devices,\nif you will, within your network.\n\n150\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.766\nSo, be very careful when I say you have\nto increase the gain of the antenna,\n\n151\n00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:45.558\nI'm not necessarily telling you you\nhave to get into the access point and\n\n152\n00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:49.442\nstart modifying these settings,\ncuz these advanced settings, right?\n\n153\n00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:51.496\nYou really have to be a wireless expert.\n\n154\n00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:53.639\nI don't know about you,\nbut I set mine to auto and\n\n155\n00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.197\nI leave it alone because If you don't\nknow what you're doing and I'll tell you,\n\n156\n00:07:57.197 --> 00:08:00.157\nbe the first one to tell you,\nI have a very limited knowledge of it.\n\n157\n00:08:00.157 --> 00:08:04.320\nIf you increase the gain, you also\nincrease the likelihood for interference.\n\n158\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.610\nSo there's a really fine\nbalance to doing that.\n\n159\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.970\nBut one of the things you can do that's\nrelatively easy, and why they become so\n\n160\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.580\npopular, wireless range extender, right.\n\n161\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.600\nJust pop that into\nan electrical outlet and\n\n162\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.890\nit extends the range of your wireless\nnetwork, very simplistic, and\n\n163\n00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.995\nit doesn't require a lot of set up, so\nthere's some things you can do as well.\n\n164\n00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:29.085\nThe other thing they call out what\nis known as an SSID not found.\n\n165\n00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:32.365\nNow, when we talked a little bit about\nwireless, we mentioned what a service and\n\n166\n00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:34.415\nidentifier is, right?\n\n167\n00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:37.135\nHere's one of those, just like we're\ntalking about with pre-shared keys,\n\n168\n00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.905\nPS case,\nhere's another technical name, right?\n\n169\n00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:39.860\nSSID.\n\n170\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.290\nIt's a network name, right?\n\n171\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.260\nIt's what identifies the network\nthat you're trying to connect to.\n\n172\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.370\nAnd your wireless adapters within your\ndevices typically what they do is they\n\n173\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.890\nsend out what are called these STA probes,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.230\nThat's a station probe.\n\n175\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.260\nYour wireless device is the station.\n\n176\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.650\nAnd it's just sending out these signals,\nsaying, hey.\n\n177\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.980\nAny access points out there?\n\n178\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.390\nAny access points out there?\n\n179\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.560\nWell, the access points,\nlike the ones we've been using, and\n\n180\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.540\nreally all the access points.\n\n181\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.870\nThey're listening out,\nconstantly for that communication.\n\n182\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.030\nAnd they say, yeah,\nlet me send you back some information.\n\n183\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.160\nSo, it lets you know, that I'm here.\n\n184\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.690\nRight, in fact,\n\n185\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.330\nif we take a look at my computer here,\nI've got my wireless adapter on right now.\n\n186\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.460\nAnd you can see there a ton of the access\npoints that are in proximity to this\n\n187\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.920\nnetwork adapter, right?\n\n188\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.740\nAnd this is what is happening,\nmy computer, my wireless adapter,\n\n189\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.120\nsaying hey, anybody out there?\n\n190\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.020\nAnybody out there?\n\n191\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.610\nAnybody out there?\n\n192\n00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.130\nAnd all the access points that\nare within this proximity,\n\n193\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.770\nthey're going to respond back.\n\n194\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.930\nBut there is a time when, maybe, your\naccess point that you are looking for, and\n\n195\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.170\nnot all these other ones that we have out\nthere, doesn't show up in the list, right?\n\n196\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.260\nI want you to focus in on this one Skynet.\n\n197\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.660\nYeah, and for some of you geeks\nout there recognize that name.\n\n198\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.450\nThat's right.\n\n199\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.420\nSkynet here.\n\n200\n00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.750\nNotice that I can see it.\n\n201\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.630\nWell, that's directly related to the\nconfiguration of the access point, itself.\n\n202\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.240\nAnd in fact,\nI'm in the basic wireless settings here.\n\n203\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.170\nAnd more specifically,\nI'm in the five gigahertz frequency.\n\n204\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.420\nIt works on 2.4 gigahertz as well.\n\n205\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:08.080\nNotice that SSID broadcast, notice that\nit is being broadcast and it is enabled.\n\n206\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.420\nSometimes, you can see\nthat it'll be disabled.\n\n207\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.140\nAnd if it's disabled,\nwe'll go ahead and save these.\n\n208\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.760\nLooks like my session timed out here so\nlet me show you guys, if you didn't\n\n209\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.070\nknow how to log in, probably shouldn't\nbe learning from me, the way I type.\n\n210\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.770\nNotice that I can turn around and\nI can disable the SSID Broadcast, and\n\n211\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.150\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll save these settings.\n\n212\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.200\nNow, it might take a second for\nmy wireless adaptor to update cuz it\n\n213\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.460\nbookmarks stuff and then it refreshes\nitself just to make sure that different\n\n214\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.990\naccess points are still\nwithin its proximity.\n\n215\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.250\nAnd let's go back up here and\nI don't know, and it's still there.\n\n216\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.120\nLet's see, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll force it.\n\n217\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.700\nWe'll see if we turn it\noff we get no information.\n\n218\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.110\nSometimes, it bookmarks that, so\n\n219\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.130\nlet me just tell you that\nsometimes it might stick.\n\n220\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.640\nAnd we'll turn it back on, and\nit does look, I'll tell you what.\n\n221\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.990\nMaybe I can forget this\nnetwork altogether.\n\n222\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.957\nIt doesn't look like I can, sometimes you\ncan forget the networks that are in here.\n\n223\n00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:07.540\nThis one looks like it\nis going to stick here.\n\n224\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.960\nBut we could also do another thing here,\nand\n\n225\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.050\ndid that, yeah that disappeared\nthere we go, there we go.\n\n226\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.900\nSo it did disappear.\n\n227\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.180\nRight, and the other thing that you can\nsee too is you can use something like\n\n228\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.350\na wireless locator.\n\n229\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.410\nSo for instance,\nMac there's all different kinds out here.\n\n230\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.850\nI got WiFi Explorer here.\n\n231\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.623\nWiFi Analzyer's a great one because that's\nin things like your Android platforms and\n\n232\n00:11:27.623 --> 00:11:29.390\nyour iOS platforms for mobile devices.\n\n233\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.976\nBut you might notice, and I certainly\ndon't expect you guys to pause the video\n\n234\n00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:35.871\nor take the time to look in this list,\nbut if I scroll down here.\n\n235\n00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:39.220\nOne of the things that I'm not\nseeing is that Skynet, right?\n\n236\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.480\nAnd I'm not seeing it in the list\nwhether it be in a wireless locator.\n\n237\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.210\nAnd it does look like it\nkind of came back there.\n\n238\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.340\nYou know what that is?\n\n239\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.310\nI know exactly what that is.\n\n240\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.490\nThat's the 2.4GHZ network, right?\n\n241\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.660\nSo the 5GHz disappeared, right?\n\n242\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.848\nAnd you seen it disappear But,\n\n243\n00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:59.440\nthe 2.4 gigahert network is\nstill broadcasting, right?\n\n244\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.230\nSo, again, you can see that the way I've\ngot this filtered by the 5 gigahert.\n\n245\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.150\nNotice all the 5 gigahert\nranges at the top.\n\n246\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.140\nAnd if we look in this list,\nwe don't see SkyNet.\n\n247\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.120\nSo, that could be the reason, and\na lot of times that is the reason,\n\n248\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.510\nI know there's conjecture on this one,\nso I'm gonna probably throw.\n\n249\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.460\nA pond in an MMA, or a rock right\nhere in the middle of an MMA fight.\n\n250\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.020\nSome people say to disable it for\nsecurity purposes so\n\n251\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.390\nthat you don't find it in the list.\n\n252\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.120\nOther people say that only keeps\nthe legitimate people out of your network,\n\n253\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.900\ncuz if anybody knows a lot\nabout wireless networking,\n\n254\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.430\nthey can still find this information.\n\n255\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.060\nHowever, when we say keeping the\nlegitimate people out, people that need to\n\n256\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.190\nconnect to the network can't find it\nsimplistically in their network adapter,\n\n257\n00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.070\nthey can't connect to the network,\nand it causes connectivity issues.\n\n258\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.000\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n259\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.410\nAll right Dan, I know we've been talking\nabout a lot of different things.\n\n260\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.840\nI do want to just kind of mention a couple\nof the software based tools that we need\n\n261\n00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.120\nto talk about before we wrap this one up.\n\n262\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.410\nAnd this is something that essentially\nWhat we can do is we can see\n\n263\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.490\ninside of our operating systems.\n\n264\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:05.920\nNow, there are hand for technologies or\nutilities that heard about there.\n\n265\n00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.970\nSome of them we gonna talked about.\n\n266\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.640\nWe mention in earlier episodes.\n\n267\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.970\nWe kinda showed how to\nuse a ping as a utility.\n\n268\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.850\nWe've shown you how to\nuse things like IP config\n\n269\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.020\nKeep in mind that there's\nother ones out there too.\n\n270\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.820\nIPConfig is in Windows, I know they have\nan older one there in Linux IFConfig,\n\n271\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.530\nthey also have IP as\nwell that you can use.\n\n272\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.310\nAnd these show you the statistics\nof the configuration of\n\n273\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.020\nyour interfaces and in Windows they call\n\n274\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.200\nit IPConfig cuz it's really just\nshowing you the IP configuration.\n\n275\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.040\nBut we also have other utilities\ntoo that can test connectivity.\n\n276\n00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.830\nOne of them in Windows is called TRACERT,\nand in fact I'll tell you what,\n\n277\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.250\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll open a command prompt up here and\n\n278\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.675\nlet's see what exactly\nTracert is all about.\n\n279\n00:13:51.675 --> 00:13:55.377\nSo I'll go ahead, and I'm going to\nlaunch a command prompt here, hopefully.\n\n280\n00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:58.653\nAnd, when we launch command prompt,\nwe're going to go ahead, and\n\n281\n00:13:58.653 --> 00:14:00.963\napparently launch a whole\nbunch of them there.\n\n282\n00:14:00.963 --> 00:14:01.465\n&gt;&gt; You went crazy.\n\n283\n00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:03.545\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n284\n00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:05.415\nAnd we're going to run tracert.\n\n285\n00:14:05.415 --> 00:14:08.205\nNow, Tracert does something\na little bit different than ping,\n\n286\n00:14:08.205 --> 00:14:12.189\neven though underneath the hood,\nit's using the same protocol.\n\n287\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:20.370\nTrace RT allows me to trace the path\na packet takes from source to destination.\n\n288\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.250\nThat's what Microsoft calls it.\n\n289\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.770\nIf you're in Mac, if you're in Unix and\n\n290\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.530\nLinux based systems,\nit's called trace route.\n\n291\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.920\nAnd that's why even in\nthe Windows environment,\n\n292\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.040\na lot of times we just call it trace\nroute, but they spell it Tracert.\n\n293\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.410\nNow, tracert again, if I, let's say\nI'm using the ping packet right, and\n\n294\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.180\nI realize that I have connectivity out to\nthe internet, I ping that remote network.\n\n295\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.600\nBut for\nsome sites I just can't seem to connect.\n\n296\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.970\nWell, you can actually do a tracert and\nyou can find out where the break down is.\n\n297\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:57.530\nSo if I do a tracert here and I do a\n4.2.2.1 provided that your firewall isn't\n\n298\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.610\nblocking this type of communication and\nhonestly that might end up happening here.\n\n299\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.920\nIt might, it's actually making it\nat least to our default gateway,\n\n300\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.110\nokay there we go it's getting out there.\n\n301\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.580\nSometimes, for security purposes ping and\ntract RT can be blocked.\n\n302\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.550\nWell, I can actually use this information.\n\n303\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.410\nAnd if I start to see asterisks here,\nand it says request time down,\n\n304\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.000\na couple of things could be happening.\n\n305\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.960\nYou could have a Firewall.\n\n306\n00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.320\nCould have security purposed.\n\n307\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.990\nThey don't want you to\nfind this information.\n\n308\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.600\nLike we see right here, or\nit could quite literally be\n\n309\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.700\nthe fact that your communication\nis stopping right there.\n\n310\n00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.360\nIn this case, I would almost guess\nDan that they've got some kind of\n\n311\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.870\nfirewall that doesn't want to\nshow you that information.\n\n312\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.257\nNow if it was to continue this way with\nthese little asterisks here that we see,\n\n313\n00:15:39.257 --> 00:15:43.710\nthat would lead me to believe that the\nreason I can't connect is somewhere along\n\n314\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.699\nthat route between my computer and\nwherever it is I'm communicating,\n\n315\n00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:50.911\nwe have the proverbial\ncommunication break down right.\n\n316\n00:15:50.911 --> 00:15:53.550\nSomething was going wrong, and\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n317\n00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.382\nYou might ask yourself well,\nI don't know any of this information.\n\n318\n00:15:56.382 --> 00:15:58.407\nAnd you're right,\na lot of times you don't.\n\n319\n00:15:58.407 --> 00:16:01.450\nBut for us here at the ITProTV\nstudios we can tell that,\n\n320\n00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.910\nthat is our firewall that we're going out.\n\n321\n00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.190\nSo we can recognize that IP address.\n\n322\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.210\nWe also know that these are our local\nInternet Service Provider, right?\n\n323\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.990\nWe talked about in another episode.\n\n324\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.950\nHow you got that hierarchy of\nInternet Service Providers?\n\n325\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.170\nWell, we can tell that\nwhen we jump on GRUCom,\n\n326\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.400\ngru here, that's our local\nInternet Service Provider.\n\n327\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.920\nAnd the thing is, if we see that\nfailure happens there, right?\n\n328\n00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.360\nOne of our tech guy here, Nate,\nhe can get on the phone and\n\n329\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.520\nhe can call GRUCom, right?\n\n330\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.220\nDon, one of the other hosts here,\nhe can get on the phone, call GRUCom and\n\n331\n00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.920\nsay, all right, what's going on?\n\n332\n00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.310\nWe see that we're not connecting.\n\n333\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.490\nNow you will see other ones in here and\nif you look at these, right?\n\n334\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.580\nThis is Level3 out in Miami,\nthis is an Internet backbone provider and\n\n335\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.420\nthis is one of the biggest network\noperation centers in the United States and\n\n336\n00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.430\nreally probably in the world, right?\n\n337\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.733\nThis is a resolvers here,\nthis is level3, this is another\n\n338\n00:16:52.733 --> 00:16:56.843\nInternet backbone provider and\nwhat I just pinged was a root hint server.\n\n339\n00:16:56.843 --> 00:16:58.720\nRight, one of the big dogs.\n\n340\n00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.920\nIf there's a breakdown in this area\nthere's really nothing you can do\n\n341\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.560\nabout it, right?\n\n342\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.100\nThey knew about it before\nyou ever discovered it.\n\n343\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.540\nAnd they have the best\ntechnicians in the world.\n\n344\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.860\nAnd they're handling it, right?\n\n345\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.210\nBut gives you an example where you\ncan see some of that information.\n\n346\n00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they have for\nyour lost is probably their load balancer.\n\n347\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, behind and\nagain for those security purposes,\n\n348\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.080\nthey don't want you to know some\nof that infrastructure there.\n\n349\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.360\nNow, there are some other commands\nthat we wanna kinda talk about.\n\n350\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.314\nIn fact, let's go ahead and let's see,\nI'm gonna fire up Internet Explorer here,\n\n351\n00:17:31.314 --> 00:17:36.207\nand we'll go ahead and,\nlet's connect outbound to, I don't know.\n\n352\n00:17:36.207 --> 00:17:42.714\nLet's see if we can connect to,\nsomething like, Google.\n\n353\n00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:46.868\nAll right, and it is going to do\nwhat it wants to do, regardless,\n\n354\n00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:48.839\nthank you Internet Explorer.\n\n355\n00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:50.211\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\nwe'll do that.\n\n356\n00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:53.217\nWe'll type www.google.\n\n357\n00:17:53.217 --> 00:17:55.781\nI might need a search engine\nto help me out with this one,\n\n358\n00:17:55.781 --> 00:17:57.290\nand we'll connect to Google.\n\n359\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.520\nNow, if you make a connection\nto another computer,\n\n360\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.190\nyou can actually see that information\nin something known as netstat.\n\n361\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:10.140\nAnd netstat here is network statistics,\nand if I type a netstat -a,\n\n362\n00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.350\nit'll actually show me all\nof the states of TCP and\n\n363\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.550\nUDP connections that I have\ncurrently on this computer.\n\n364\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.700\nNow, I do want you to understand\nthat UDP isnt going to see you,\n\n365\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.100\nyour not going to see any information\nin UDP because UDP is stateless, right?\n\n366\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.481\nIt isnt a connection orientated service\nbut some of the things that I can see\n\n367\n00:18:29.481 --> 00:18:31.963\nare those established\nconnections that we have here.\n\n368\n00:18:31.963 --> 00:18:35.473\nAnd I can see some of them right there\ngoing back who knows this is probably some\n\n369\n00:18:35.473 --> 00:18:38.230\ntype of web crawler in the background for\nall we know.\n\n370\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.160\nBut I can see those\nestablished connections.\n\n371\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.340\nThat is one of the tools that you have\ninside of your Windows operating system.\n\n372\n00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.710\nAll right, couple more that\nwe wanna kinda talk about.\n\n373\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.300\nThere's another one that's more for\na legacy service today,\n\n374\n00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.810\nthan it is for a more modern service.\n\n375\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.580\nAnd that's something called nbtstat.\n\n376\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.510\nThat is short for, I love this one, it's\neasier to remember the shortened version.\n\n377\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.340\nThat's nbtstat.\n\n378\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.640\nAnd when we needed to find out\ninformation about NetBIOS names and\n\n379\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.940\nthe resolution of\nthe services are provided.\n\n380\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.370\nWe could use this type of command, right?\n\n381\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.560\nYou probably see there's not\na lot of information here.\n\n382\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.990\nI don't know that this is going\nto be too specific for us.\n\n383\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.220\nIn fact, let me go ahead and do a -a here.\n\n384\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.960\nAll right, And did I not do that right?\n\n385\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.780\nLooks like we've got nbtstat -a,\nand maybe,\n\n386\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.320\nI don't know, maybe I put a space\nin there when I shouldn't have.\n\n387\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.056\nnbtstat -a.\n\n388\n00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.510\nWe will get this right eventually.\n\n389\n00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.780\nDoesn't look like I have, it's giving\nme a hard time for some reason,\n\n390\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.730\nbut I don't see.\n\n391\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.674\nI know one of them.\n&gt;&gt; We gotta figure out the IP address or\n\n392\n00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:53.530\nremote-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n393\n00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.050\nwell there's another one\nI'm gonna go ahead and run.\n\n394\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.152\nI'm gonna run -r here.\n\n395\n00:19:57.152 --> 00:20:01.189\nAnd -r usually will give you\nsome kind of information.\n\n396\n00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:05.210\nIt looks like my computer is\nrunning a little bit slow here.\n\n397\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.870\nGotta love that, and I tell you what,\nI almost know, bet you I know what it is,\n\n398\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.020\nWindows is probably running\nan update in the background and\n\n399\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.430\nit loves to do that on you.\n\n400\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.610\nBut there is one other one that\nI'm gonna run, nbtstats, and\n\n401\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:21.240\nthat is the -r, and\nthat gives you a little bit more output.\n\n402\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.898\nIt could be the fact that I don't have\nany remote names in that list, so\n\n403\n00:20:24.898 --> 00:20:27.196\nit's saying there's nothing to show you.\n\n404\n00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:30.529\nI think one of the main things\nother than remembering that\n\n405\n00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.967\nthis is specific to NetBIOS space names.\n\n406\n00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:38.140\nIf you see, and you've seen it quite\na few times cuz I couldn't type, right?\n\n407\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.070\nThe fact that I'll go ahead and\nrun this and let it show me the output.\n\n408\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.900\nLike coulda just run a forward slash\nquestion mark, but it will do the same.\n\n409\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.910\nI think the big one Dan on this one\nI want you to remember is in Windows,\n\n410\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.820\nmost things aren't case sensitive.\n\n411\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.700\nIn Nick's base system Lenox you\nbetter get used to case sensitivity.\n\n412\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.390\nIt is very important.\n\n413\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.650\nIn Windows it isn't,\nexcept for this command.\n\n414\n00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.160\nNotice there's a big difference in here,\nwe've got a little a, lowercase a,\n\n415\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.030\nwe've got uppercase a.\n\n416\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.260\nWe've got a lowercase r which shows\nme the list that I just pulled up,\n\n417\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.765\nversus the uppercase r says, just go ahead\nand purge that list big difference, right?\n\n418\n00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:18.545\nSo definitely no nbtstat\nthat is one that you can do.\n\n419\n00:21:18.545 --> 00:21:21.315\nThere's other commands out there like NET,\nand I'm going to go ahead and\n\n420\n00:21:21.315 --> 00:21:24.445\nrun this by itself so\nwe can see some of the options you can do.\n\n421\n00:21:24.445 --> 00:21:30.160\nWe use NET like for instance NET in\ncombination with net use to map.\n\n422\n00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.360\nNetwork drives so\n\n423\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.620\nthat I can connect to the shared\nresources out there on our networks.\n\n424\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.999\nYou also have another one that's,\nit's still there, netdom.\n\n425\n00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:40.591\nAnd you know what?\n\n426\n00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.180\nIt looks like it's\nactually been taken out.\n\n427\n00:21:43.225 --> 00:21:46.095\nNetdom is a way, and\nwe can also do this with a NET command,\n\n428\n00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:49.715\nnetdom was a way that you could\njoin a Windows domain, right.\n\n429\n00:21:49.715 --> 00:21:53.915\nIt's in the list, again we're using\nthings like power shell and stuff today.\n\n430\n00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:56.965\nSo I do want you to be\naware that it is there.\n\n431\n00:21:56.965 --> 00:22:00.125\nKnow the other ones that\nwe've also talked about too.\n\n432\n00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:03.810\nAgain ping, ipconfig, ifconfig, tracert,\n\n433\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:09.560\nnbtstat, netstat as well as netdom.\n\n434\n00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.230\nLast one I wanna talk about when it comes\n\n435\n00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.580\nto the software based utilities\nis something known as nslookup.\n\n436\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:22.740\nNslookup allows you the ability to see\nif your computer can do name resolution,\n\n437\n00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.930\nremember what DNS is doing for us.\n\n438\n00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.900\nDNS has taken a fully qualified domain\nname and mapping it to an IP address.\n\n439\n00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.150\nSo if I need to figure out can\nmy computer do name resolution.\n\n440\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.600\nI can type nslookup.\n\n441\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.258\nAnd let's say www.google.com.\n\n442\n00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:40.880\nLet's see how fast this resolves.\n\n443\n00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.989\nAgain, I think it's probably doing some\nupdates in the back, wasn't too bad.\n\n444\n00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:50.417\nAnd I can see that the name www.google.com\nresolves to the IPv6 Addresses and\n\n445\n00:22:50.417 --> 00:22:51.720\nIPv4 Addresses.\n\n446\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.400\nIf that didn't happen then we\ncould see we'd check the TCP/IP\n\n447\n00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.290\nproperties of the network adapter and\nfind out if we've got a you know\n\n448\n00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.090\nan IP address that's misconfigured\nin manual configuration.\n\n449\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.280\nOr maybe I don't have the default\ngateway set up right and\n\n450\n00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.320\nit's not passing the DNS information\nthrough to the DNS server.\n\n451\n00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes,\nwe have a bevy of different software\n\n452\n00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.970\ntools at our ready to\n&gt;&gt; Be able to troubleshoot some of these\n\n453\n00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.270\nnetworks to connectivity issues, but\n\n454\n00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.940\nwe also have some physical tools as\nwell that we might have to employ.\n\n455\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.107\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ndefiantly they call out a few, right,\n\n456\n00:23:25.107 --> 00:23:27.509\nbecause sometimes it's a logical issue,\nright?\n\n457\n00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:30.777\nAnd sometimes you gotta go Spock on it,\nthat's a logical capital,\n\n458\n00:23:30.777 --> 00:23:32.843\nsometimes it's again a physical issue and\n\n459\n00:23:32.843 --> 00:23:36.410\nthank goodness we got a whole plethora\nof them sitting on the table here.\n\n460\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.161\nSo if we can take a look you can see some\nof the kinds that they call out, right?\n\n461\n00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:43.952\nOne of the kinds that they call\nout is what's known as a tone.\n\n462\n00:23:43.952 --> 00:23:47.580\nThey call it a tone generator and\na Tone Pro.\n\n463\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.204\nSometimes it just emits a light.\n\n464\n00:23:49.204 --> 00:23:52.010\nSometimes it does emit an audible sound.\n\n465\n00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.934\nAnd what this does is essentially\nyou can plug this into the cable.\n\n466\n00:23:56.934 --> 00:24:02.132\nAnd you can go over to basically\na spaghetti sized bundle of cables and\n\n467\n00:24:02.132 --> 00:24:05.190\nyou can touch the tone locator to it.\n\n468\n00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:10.011\nAnd what happens is when it comes in\ncontact with the electrical current that\n\n469\n00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:14.091\nthe generator is providing,\nit emits an audible tone, right?\n\n470\n00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:17.290\nAnd that might not make sense when\nyou have just one or two cables.\n\n471\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.700\nBut literally out of the wall when\nyou have 400 of these CAT cables and\n\n472\n00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.080\nit's-\n&gt;&gt; Which one's mine?\n\n473\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, which one's which?\n\n474\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.510\nAnd it's a 300 pound bundle,\n\n475\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.390\nyou certainly don't wanna take the time\nto go through every single one.\n\n476\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.699\nSo tone locators, if you will,\nthey call it a locater and a generator,\n\n477\n00:24:31.699 --> 00:24:33.476\nit's typically one in the same unit.\n\n478\n00:24:33.476 --> 00:24:37.652\nAnd one, it basically generates\nan electrical current and\n\n479\n00:24:37.652 --> 00:24:39.580\nthe other one emits a tone.\n\n480\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.040\nAnd when you touch it to the wire and\n\n481\n00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.140\nyou find the cable that's got that\nelectrical current going through it.\n\n482\n00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.000\nA couple of the other things\nthat we have here on the table,\n\n483\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.240\nwe've got what's known as a cable crimper.\n\n484\n00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.736\nAnd there are a couple different kinds,\ntoo, right?\n\n485\n00:24:50.736 --> 00:24:54.617\nThis is one that is an RJ45 and\nan RJ11 crimper,\n\n486\n00:24:54.617 --> 00:24:58.890\nright, the RJ45 being the bigger one for\nEthernet.\n\n487\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.993\nNext to it its older, smaller\ncousin here is the RJ11, that's for\n\n488\n00:25:02.993 --> 00:25:04.845\nthe traditional phone lines.\n\n489\n00:25:04.845 --> 00:25:08.937\nAnd again, what you would do is you wire\nthe cable according to, in this case,\n\n490\n00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:12.417\nlet's just take a RJ45 for\nan example, or the AP8C connector.\n\n491\n00:25:12.417 --> 00:25:17.265\nYou would take and\nyou would wire it either 568A or 568B.\n\n492\n00:25:17.265 --> 00:25:19.360\nYou'd put it in here and\nyou'd crimp it down.\n\n493\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.060\nHence the name, right?\n\n494\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.020\nThe other thing that you have as well is,\n\n495\n00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.360\nyou could have something like\na coaxial connector here.\n\n496\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.935\nAnd this is one where if you are using,\n\n497\n00:25:28.935 --> 00:25:32.860\nlike our production team here\nhas to use this quite a lot.\n\n498\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.210\nThey run some crazy cables.\n\n499\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.800\nI've seen them make cables that actually\ncome down off of a 24 foot tall building,\n\n500\n00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.500\noff of the roof into the back\nof a soundboard, right?\n\n501\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.440\nAnd that would be your coaxial cable.\n\n502\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.070\nAnd you put your BNC connector here, run\nthe coaxial cable into the background and\n\n503\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.470\nthen crimp it down and\nit essentially attaches the coaxial cable.\n\n504\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.686\nNow they call it a couple\nof different things.\n\n505\n00:25:56.686 --> 00:25:59.600\nThey call it wire strippers and\nthere's all different things.\n\n506\n00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.120\nI kinda use these right here\ncuz I like how thick they are.\n\n507\n00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.520\nBut there's also cable strippers, too.\n\n508\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.610\nAnd this is an example of a cable stripper\nthat would prepare the coaxial cable.\n\n509\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.630\nHowever, I will say,\n\n510\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.750\nguys and gals out there, this one has\na cable stripper right in there, right?\n\n511\n00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.000\nYou can almost kind of see it.\n\n512\n00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.220\nIn fact, you're gonna see here,\nif we can zoom down in,\n\n513\n00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.360\nI actually used this to\nkind of show you guys\n\n514\n00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.930\nthe cables here that we're going\nto run the cable tester on, right?\n\n515\n00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.430\nSo another cable tester that\nwe have here in the studios.\n\n516\n00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:33.840\nNow this cable is good and\nwe can tell that by plugging one end in.\n\n517\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.440\nThis would also work on\na coaxial implementation, too,\n\n518\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.430\nif you wanted to test the single\ncopper conductor that runs through it.\n\n519\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.500\nIn this case, when I turn this on,\nit's gonna send an electrical\n\n520\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.380\nsignal down the eight individual\nconductors in the four twisted pairs.\n\n521\n00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.350\nAnd it is going to be something that,\n\n522\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.030\nit lets me know in this case,\nhey, it's good, right?\n\n523\n00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.820\nReversal can happen and I've actually\ndone this on quite a few occasions.\n\n524\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.240\nI don't know if I should admit\nto that here on the show, but\n\n525\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.700\nyou can ask any one of the hosts.\n\n526\n00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.420\nSometimes I get too quick\nputting that RJ45 jack in.\n\n527\n00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.070\nMaybe I won't put the conductor\n\n528\n00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.660\nright down onto the connector when I\ncrimp it down and it'll let you know.\n\n529\n00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.040\nBut sometimes you reverse it, sometimes\nyou can have something like this.\n\n530\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.053\nNow, guys and gals out there,\n\n531\n00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:23.249\nI wouldn't ever suggest doing this if\nyou've got one of your good connectors.\n\n532\n00:27:23.249 --> 00:27:27.210\nBut let's see here, let's see if I\ncan cause a break in one of these.\n\n533\n00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.580\nI'm not sure, there we go.\n\n534\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.108\nNotice that we've got now a pair that\ndon't have any lights coming on.\n\n535\n00:27:35.108 --> 00:27:35.928\n&gt;&gt; Two pairs.\n\n536\n00:27:35.928 --> 00:27:36.456\n&gt;&gt; Two pairs, that's right.\n\n537\n00:27:36.456 --> 00:27:40.110\nWe've got two pairs, so I did a pretty\ngood job on breaking that one, right?\n\n538\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.670\nAnd it's letting me know now\nthat we don't have connectivity.\n\n539\n00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.560\nAnd this also goes, I wanna go ahead and\nnow shout out to Jim out there in\n\n540\n00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.110\nthe chat room, he says you gotta be very,\nvery careful in not nicking these wires.\n\n541\n00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:58.680\nBecause even the slightest little\ncut in the shielding itself,\n\n542\n00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.400\ncan cause an electromagnetic interference.\n\n543\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.740\nAnd especially when you're\ntalking like CAT 6 and above,\n\n544\n00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.830\nCAT 6A, and when you're going for things\nlike gigabit speeds, there's almost zero\n\n545\n00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:20.080\ntolerance for any kind of nick in\nthe sheathing, let alone as drastic\n\n546\n00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.420\nas I've done here where I've actually\ncut one of the cables in the bunch.\n\n547\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.370\nIf we could zoom in just a little bit\nfarther, you guys can kind of see this.\n\n548\n00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:33.850\nIt lets me know what I should\nbe looking for when it comes to\n\n549\n00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.760\nthe actual 568A and 568B.\n\n550\n00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.930\nIt lets me know how the wiring should go.\n\n551\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.500\nSo if you ever needed\nkind of like a guide for\n\n552\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.000\nthe standard,\nyou could always Google this, too.\n\n553\n00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.140\nBut this is kinda nice,\nbecause it tells you what pins one and\n\n554\n00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.670\npins three should be.\n\n555\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.890\nRight, versus pair four, pair five.\n\n556\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.580\nDown here you can see what the blue pair\nand the brown pair, a lot of times that's\n\n557\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:05.172\nyour ground versus your transmit and\nyour recipient or receive pin.\n\n558\n00:29:05.172 --> 00:29:07.260\nSo a couple of the different connectors,\nand\n\n559\n00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:12.830\nagain you can see here it supports things,\nlike for instance your RJ45 jack, as\n\n560\n00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.940\nwell as if you're doing some kind of B and\nC work as well in audio communications.\n\n561\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.590\nAll right, Dan, I know that we have run\nthe gamut when it comes to a lot of\n\n562\n00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.910\nthe different things that you can see.\n\n563\n00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.990\nHopefully we've shown you a good bit of\nsymptoms and some of the things that you\n\n564\n00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:32.290\ncould do to remediate, well, identify and\nremediate those symptoms, as well\n\n565\n00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.350\nas some of the logical and software-based\ntools that you need to know on the exam.\n\n566\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.440\nAs well as some of the physical tools\nthat you have out there when it\n\n567\n00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.630\ncomes to maintaining those networks and\nkeeping them running like they should.\n\n568\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well, we do appreciate\nyou running us through these tools and\n\n569\n00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.860\nsymptoms that we might encounter when\nnetwork connectivity is the issue.\n\n570\n00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.150\nThat being said, looks like we're\nout of time for this episode.\n\n571\n00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.610\nWe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n572\n00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.500\nHopefully you've enjoyed it and\nlearned a lot.\n\n573\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.210\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n574\n00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n575\n00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.016\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n576\n00:30:02.016 -->

00:00:12.136\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:16.660\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone, welcome\nto another great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.005\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and today's\nepisode, well it's all about more in our\n\n6\n00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.210\nA+ series we're trying to move along\nthat train it is definitely a long and\n\n7\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.360\nillustrious journey, that is for sure.\n\n8\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.880\nAnd of course joining us, leading us even,\nin that journey, our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.500\nWes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.853\nWes, we're glad to have you again,\nhow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:36.284\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, it is like one\nof those trains you confront out there in\n\n12\n00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:40.602\nthe Midwest where if you're at the\nrailroad tracks, passes in the morning.\n\n13\n00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.542\nBy the time you're ready to clock\nout in the afternoon it is done.\n\n14\n00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:48.523\nThat's right, so well what part of\nthe train are we looking at at this point?\n\n15\n00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:50.733\nWe are continuing along\nin troubleshooting,\n\n16\n00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.690\nwe've looked in some of the past\ntroubleshooting episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.240\nWe looked at some of the different\ncomponents like motherboard, RAM,\n\n18\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.400\nif you will, power issues, talk about CPU.\n\n19\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.930\nWe've shown you some of the parts that\nyou can see as well inside of things like\n\n20\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.550\nlaptops.\n\n21\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.110\nAnd really when it comes down to it, we're\ngonna be talking about mobile devices, and\n\n22\n00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280\nas you can see already by the title\nof this show, we'll be looking at\n\n23\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120\nsome of the common issues that you can\nface when it comes to mobile devices.\n\n24\n00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.350\nHowever, one of the things that we wanna\nkinda preface to this whole entire episode\n\n25\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.680\nwith is the fact that well, guess what, a\ncomputer is a computer, is a computer and\n\n26\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.170\nmobile devices are really no different.\n\n27\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.630\nThey have all the same components that\nyou have inside of your work stations and\n\n28\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.480\nyour laptops.\n\n29\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.890\nAnd again we're just talking about\nmaybe more of a minuscule, smaller,\n\n30\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030\nvery compact type form factor.\n\n31\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.910\nAnd just like we've mentioned in laptops,\nright,\n\n32\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.890\nwe said two of the major\nconsiderations when it comes to\n\n33\n00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.110\nlaptop technology is battery life and\nthermal management, right.\n\n34\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.540\nAnd when we say thermal management\nwe don't want things to over heat.\n\n35\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.320\nAnd we have a very, very restrictive\namount of space in which we can\n\n36\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.630\nplace things like cooling systems, right.\n\n37\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.310\nWell, that gets even smaller when\nyou talk about more mobility, right.\n\n38\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.720\nWhere a laptop yeah,\nis a mobile device, but\n\n39\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.740\nit's really classified today\nmore as a portable device.\n\n40\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.230\nBecause on a smaller scale mobile devices\nare things like your tablets, cell phones,\n\n41\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.940\nthey even quote and we talk about this\nin other episodes like the phablet,\n\n42\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.850\nwhich I think is great,\nthat's a phone tablet right, [LAUGH].\n\n43\n00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.440\nIt's essentially like a note right,\n\n44\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.090\nGalaxy Note if you guys have\nsee those out there, right.\n\n45\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.770\nThey had basically a phone that's almost\nthe size of a note book or, if you will,\n\n46\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.390\na tablet, there.\n\n47\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.910\nSo again, that is some of the things\nthat you have to keep in my mind again,\n\n48\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.370\nyou have to worry about battery life and\nover heating.\n\n49\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.450\nNow the other thing, when it comes\nto troubleshooting these issues and\n\n50\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.901\nrepairing them, there are two basics that\nwe also have to keep in mind, right.\n\n51\n00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:41.475\nWe have to keep mind things like, devices,\nor components within these devices,\n\n52\n00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:42.270\nI should say,\n\n53\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.198\nthat are field serviceable versus things\nthat aren't field serviceable, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:51.052\nNon-field serviceable items, things that\nwell, we're gonna have to get an upgrade\n\n55\n00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:53.760\nor we're gonna have to just\ncompletely replace the device.\n\n56\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.480\nAnd I wanna kinda just start out there\nbefore we move in to some of the different\n\n57\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.940\ncategories that they call out, and\nladies and gentlemen out there,\n\n58\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.950\nthey call out a bunch here.\n\n59\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.030\nSo we are gonna kinda just\nrifle through these and\n\n60\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.040\ntalk about each category\nhere individually.\n\n61\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.113\nBut starting out I wanna talk about\nrepairs verses upgrade slash replacement.\n\n62\n00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:14.826\nNow the reason I'm putting upgrades and\nreplacement,\n\n63\n00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:17.907\nif you will,\nin the same in the same category is\n\n64\n00:03:17.907 --> 00:03:22.574\nbecause let's say that you have\na component that you can't replace.\n\n65\n00:03:22.574 --> 00:03:26.055\nWell, that means you can't upgrade it\neither, right, because it's built in,\n\n66\n00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:27.681\nit's soldered into the PCB, right.\n\n67\n00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:31.379\nWe have a lot of SOC devices,\nsystem on a chip, it's interesting Dan,\n\n68\n00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.156\nI actually heard a term that I've\nalways associated with voice over IP.\n\n69\n00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:38.071\nI was looking up and researching and\nI found SIP, and I'm like, well,\n\n70\n00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:41.490\nSIP, I know that's a session initiation\nprotocol and has to do with voice over IP.\n\n71\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.650\nIt is system in a package, right.\n\n72\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.330\n&gt;&gt; System in a package.\n\n73\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.500\n&gt;&gt; So another classification\nof system on a chip.\n\n74\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.895\nBasically everything is located\non a single board, right.\n\n75\n00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:52.240\n&gt;&gt; It's a new one to me as well my man.\n\n76\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got no clue, I was like well,\nnow we have another acronym.\n\n77\n00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:59.655\nSo thank goodness that acronym isn't gonna\nbe in the acronym list at the end of\n\n78\n00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:00.415\nthe objectives.\n\n79\n00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:03.335\nBut it might be a term that you\nstart to hear more and more, right.\n\n80\n00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:07.145\nBecause it's easier to sell something\nif it sounds like a new product.\n\n81\n00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:10.073\nAnd a lot of times all it is is\na repainting of an old product and\n\n82\n00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:12.838\nit's just marketed as something brand new,\nall right.\n\n83\n00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:17.357\nSo, remember, something that is upgradable\nor isn't upgradable I guess I should say,\n\n84\n00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:20.204\nis gonna require you to\nreplace the device, all right.\n\n85\n00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:24.270\nSo let's give you an example of some\nthings that are field serviceable, right.\n\n86\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.663\nSomething that you can replace\nif it gets damaged, right.\n\n87\n00:04:26.663 --> 00:04:28.793\nWe think about things like your screens.\n\n88\n00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:32.310\nNow when we talk about screens remember,\nwe talk about cracked screens.\n\n89\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.420\n&gt;&gt; We've all seen these, right?\n\n90\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n91\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.610\n&gt;&gt; The teenage girl that's running\naround with something that looks like\n\n92\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.850\nshe hit it with a baseball bat.\n\n93\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, an elaborate screen saver.\n\n94\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes the spiderweb.\n\n95\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly that.\n\n96\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.020\nYou see somebody and they got a bunch of\nband aids on their fingers looks like\n\n97\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.080\nthey're Micheal Jackson from the 80s.\n\n98\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.940\nHolding the microphones\nwith blisters on his hands.\n\n99\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.850\nBut well, a lot of times these\nthings can be replaced, now,\n\n100\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.570\nI don't mean necessarily that you\nmight be able to replace them.\n\n101\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.060\nI wouldn't try to replace\na screen to save my life,\n\n102\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.190\nbecause I know I've cracked many\nof these mobile devices open.\n\n103\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.950\nAnd a lot of times what you have to do is\nyou have to get a kit because when you\n\n104\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.840\nopen the device, you break the clips that\nare basically holding that screen on,\n\n105\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.320\nin place.\n\n106\n00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.220\nThe other thing you also have to keep\nin mind too is that a lot of times they\n\n107\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.430\nhave capacitive and\nresistive touch screens.\n\n108\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.770\nAnd those could be damaged\nif you're replacing them.\n\n109\n00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.602\nSo you've got other sensors that\nhave to be replaced with the screen.\n\n110\n00:05:23.602 --> 00:05:26.352\nBut the point is they can be replaced,\nright.\n\n111\n00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.547\nIf you damage a screen you\ncould take it to some company,\n\n112\n00:05:28.547 --> 00:05:31.130\nmaybe you're thinking about\ngetting into that type of company.\n\n113\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.360\nMaybe you're gonna be a tech at\none of those companies, right.\n\n114\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.860\nStorage expansion, now with the exception,\nand I don't have it on me right now,\n\n115\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.960\nI wish I could show you,\nI've got a Google Pixel.\n\n116\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.359\nNot every device, not every mobile device\nallows you the ability to put like\n\n117\n00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:48.640\na micro SD card in and\nexpand the storage capabilities.\n\n118\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.660\nHowever, a lot of them do, right, a lot\nof these mobile devices, tablets, and\n\n119\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.070\nstuff like that do allow\nyou to do just that.\n\n120\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.144\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mine does that, I have the new\nGalaxy S8 and it has a micro SD card.\n\n121\n00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:03.661\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, and it's one of those things\nthat if you have cloud based technologies,\n\n122\n00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:05.282\nmaybe that's not a concern.\n\n123\n00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.724\nAnd again, this is not really a buying or\nselling point but\n\n124\n00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:12.391\nDan's phone needs to upgrade\nthe storage capacity, right.\n\n125\n00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:14.601\nit's upgradeable in the fact that\nhe doesn't have to replace it and\n\n126\n00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.600\nit's something that could be\nfilled serviceable, right.\n\n127\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.057\nHe can go to Best Buy or Newegg or\nTigerDirect and get a 128,\n\n128\n00:06:21.057 --> 00:06:23.930\none of those 128 gig micro SD cards.\n\n129\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.360\nSlap right in there and now we got a 128\ngigs that maybe we started out with 32,\n\n130\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.730\nright, or 64,\nI know they're different capacity.\n\n131\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.070\nSo it's something like that,\ndamage screen, no display, can't see that,\n\n132\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.020\nwe can't use or interact with the device,\nwe can replace that.\n\n133\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.596\nStorage expansion, right, this is\nsomething that's field serviceable.\n\n134\n00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:47.510\nNon-integrated batteries,\nthat's another thing, right.\n\n135\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.230\nIf you have a battery that's\ngot basically a cover and\n\n136\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.040\nyou can replace the battery\nthat's a field serviceable thing.\n\n137\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.080\nSo if you get a swollen battery, right,\na swollen battery typically means that,\n\n138\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.810\nthat battery is not only is about\nto explode but you pretty much,\n\n139\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.590\nyou need to replace it, right,\nand usually replace it fast.\n\n140\n00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.410\nBut it's something that we\ncan do in the field, right.\n\n141\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.040\nIf you're a tech, you can do this for\nsomebody or if you're just\n\n142\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.300\na tech savvy and user, you can go\nover to your electronics company and\n\n143\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.760\njust match it with the model and replace\nthe batter, right, it's field serviceable.\n\n144\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.750\nHere's another thing SIM cards.\n\n145\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.945\nCertain mobile devices allow\nyou to switch carriers.\n\n146\n00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:27.707\nOnes that use the SIM cards are on\nthe GSM, the global systems for\n\n147\n00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:30.992\nmobile communication,\ntelecommunication, right.\n\n148\n00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.880\nI know technically,\nit's called Global Systems for Mobiles but\n\n149\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.622\nmobile telecommunications, right.\n\n150\n00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.960\nIf I'm on a GSM base network\nfrom my provider, guess what?\n\n151\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.170\nI can buy a new phone, I can upgrade and\n\n152\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.340\nit's essentially another thing that could\nbe considered field serviceable cuz I can\n\n153\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.610\npop out the SIM card that\nhas all of my information.\n\n154\n00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.820\nAnd I could put it into a new phone or\na new device and guess what?\n\n155\n00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.413\nNow I'm not carrier locked.\n\n156\n00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:59.405\nNow, that is the polar opposites to\nsomething that maybe is on one of the CDMA\n\n157\n00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:00.579\nphones, right.\n\n158\n00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:05.059\nCode Division Multiple Access phones,\nright, CDMA carriers.\n\n159\n00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:06.392\nThey don't have sim cards.\n\n160\n00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:07.498\nYou get carried a lot.\n\n161\n00:08:07.498 --> 00:08:08.312\nYou get vendor locked.\n\n162\n00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:13.190\nSo if I need to replace the phone,\nit's not gonna be filed serviceable.\n\n163\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's gonna be something where I\nhave to literally buy a new phone.\n\n164\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.068\nI gotta upgrade, all right.\n\n165\n00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:22.760\nNow other non-field serviceable parts,\nbuilt in non-flash memory right?\n\n166\n00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.840\nThis isn't like things like laptops\nthat have sodium modules in them,\n\n167\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.260\nwhere I can replace them, right?\n\n168\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.350\nIf it's integrated into the phone, and\nfirst of all something fails in it,\n\n169\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.130\nI have to replace the entire phone.\n\n170\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.840\nAnd here's where\nthe upgrade part comes in.\n\n171\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.740\nMaybe I need more memory in my phone,\nwell sorry,\n\n172\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.270\nyou're not gonna be able to upgrade,\nyou're gonna have to replace the device.\n\n173\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.560\nCPUs and we talk in another\nepisode about the mobile CPUs,\n\n174\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.470\nbut it doesn't matter if you're\ntalking about the A series from Apple,\n\n175\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.670\nall the A4, A5's all the way up to 8,\n9, X now that they have today.\n\n176\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.230\nSnapdragon, Snapdragon Pros are out there.\n\n177\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.070\nIntel has their I series and\ntheir Intel M series.\n\n178\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.930\nAMD has their A series as well.\n\n179\n00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.120\nAll of these are great.\n\n180\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.100\nI think a lot of times it can't be\nreplaced because they're an SOC device.\n\n181\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.420\nSystem On a Chip means the whole entire\nthing is integrated on the motherboard and\n\n182\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.500\nit is a surface mounted device that is\ndirectly soldered to the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n183\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.380\nAgain it's non field serviceable.\n\n184\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.360\nSo I wanted to kinda preface this whole\nentire episode before we get in to some of\n\n185\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.570\nthe components that you could see and some\nof the situations they put us in that you\n\n186\n00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.760\ndon't always have a one\nsize fit all solution.\n\n187\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.320\nSome devices,\nyes you might be able to upgrade.\n\n188\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.050\nSome devices, you might be able\nto change things interactively.\n\n189\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.700\nLike the screens somethings unfortunately,\nyou're out of luck on that [INAUDIBLE]\n\n190\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.370\nhave Have to replace the device,\nthat's just the way it goes.\n\n191\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.370\nAll right, so what are some of the things,\n\n192\n00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.250\nsome of the symptoms that we\nhave to worry about, right?\n\n193\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.430\nWe briefly just mentioned no display,\nright, a cracked display.\n\n194\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.320\nLike Dan was saying, the teenager that\njust happened to have the phone out there\n\n195\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.720\nat the food court, drops it.\n\n196\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.080\nOr the person that puts it in the back\nof their pocket, goes to grab it,\n\n197\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.740\ndrops it, right.\n\n198\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.070\nWhatever cracks the display\nIf you have no display,\n\n199\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.030\nchances are you've obviously damaged it.\n\n200\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.550\nNow I say that it doesn't necessarily\nmean that it's a damaged display.\n\n201\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.960\nIt could be a power issue, right.\n\n202\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.560\nIf your phone isn't or if your device\nisn't getting charged, you have no power.\n\n203\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.770\nObviously you have no display.\n\n204\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.900\nSo we have to go through some\ntrouble shooting techniques.\n\n205\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.330\nAnd always question the obvious right.\n\n206\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.550\nWe find out what are the symptoms?\n\n207\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.530\nOnce we know what the symptoms are, we can\ntry to identify what the root cause is.\n\n208\n00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.450\nWe got to be careful.\n\n209\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.760\nWe don't want to treat the symptom and\nnot the cause.\n\n210\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.180\nIf you, I have no screen, no display.\n\n211\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.280\nWell, I replace the screen,\ncost me 200 bucks, but\n\n212\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.210\nit was actually the battery that had\nfailed and I had no power to the device.\n\n213\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.830\nWell, you treated the symptom, but you\ndidn't actually get to the root cause, so\n\n214\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.540\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n215\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.910\nIt could be battery issues.\n\n216\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.580\nThe other thing that can happen with\nthese devices, like we've shown you in\n\n217\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.300\nthe laptop issue, remember every device\nis gonna have some form of backlighting\n\n218\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.028\ndevice, if it's an OLED or\nyou know the, I almost said orthogonal,\n\n219\n00:10:56.028 --> 00:11:00.410\n[LAUGH] organic light-emitting diode, if\nit's an LCD screen, if it's an LED screen.\n\n220\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.240\nWell if it's an LED screen,\nit's going to be something called a TFT,\n\n221\n00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.710\na Thin Film Transistor, and yes,\nthose transistors can fail.\n\n222\n00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.560\nThe back lighting sources\ncan fail as well, and\n\n223\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.910\nif it's the back lighting source it can\nalso give you a dim display, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.570\nOne of the things that I'll tell some\npeople that have asked me before says,\n\n225\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.860\nI got a really dim screen and\nI can't figure out what is going on.\n\n226\n00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.510\nWell, here's something that you can do.\n\n227\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.940\nGo into a room, even if you have to go\ninto a closet, that has zero light in it.\n\n228\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.130\nTurn the device on.\n\n229\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.190\nif you can just faintly see a screen,\nit's your back light source that's failed.\n\n230\n00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.250\nIt's a typical indication that\nthe back light inverter has failed and\n\n231\n00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.830\nyou have to replace it.\n\n232\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.690\nSometimes you can replace it.\n\n233\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.530\nAgain, sometimes you might not be\nable to replace it, all right.\n\n234\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.750\nSo with dim display,\nit could be configuration.\n\n235\n00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.790\nDan, I don't know, does your phone do this\nto you, when you start to lose power,\n\n236\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.090\nwhere it just automatically dims\nthe screen because it's trying to conserve\n\n237\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.320\nbattery life?\n\n238\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Well the S8 has a weird\nfeature where it's\n\n239\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.475\nalways kind of doing that unless\nyou're actually using the phone.\n\n240\n00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:58.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so they're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.920\n&gt;&gt; They're really green, super green.\n\n242\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and mine honestly,\n\n243\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.100\nI was to mention that too, right?\n\n244\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.174\nSo a dim screen could be\n\n245\n00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:06.885\na power saving feature\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n246\n00:12:06.885 --> 00:12:09.935\nAnd like Darren said,\nit might be happening all the time.\n\n247\n00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:12.765\nMine definitely does it once\nit gets to the low power.\n\n248\n00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:16.535\nIt asks you do you, and I think this\nis more of a feature of Android,\n\n249\n00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.405\nit asks you do you wanna\nturn on power saving.\n\n250\n00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:23.780\nAnd when you do you lose the ability to do\nbackground applications updates as well.\n\n251\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.950\n&gt;&gt; You dim the screen out.\n\n252\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.650\nIt could be a configuration where,\n\n253\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.940\nquite literally, you've taken\nthe slider on the operating system and\n\n254\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.920\nslide the brightness all the way down and\nyou can barely see it.\n\n255\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.710\nDirect sunlight, again, sometimes when you\nget these phones out there in the direct\n\n256\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.160\nsunlight, what ends up happening is\nyou can't even see them at all and\n\n257\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.090\n&gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the screen.\n\n258\n00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.244\nAll right.\nSo do keep that in mind that it could be\n\n259\n00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:44.770\nconfiguration.\n\n260\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.760\nIt could be direct sunlight,\npower saving settings are initiated and\n\n261\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.040\nit could be constantly going on or\nsome of the other things that we have.\n\n262\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.350\nA flickering display.\n\n263\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.540\nNow, a lot of times,\n\n264\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.609\nI will tell you, a flickering display\nhas to do with a loose connection.\n\n265\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.160\nNot always but a lot of times it\nhas to do with a loose connection.\n\n266\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.120\nIt could be a damage display.\n\n267\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.050\nI've seen where these, you drop these\nphones, you drop these tablets and they\n\n268\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.530\nget a little crack in the glass and you'll\nsee a little bit of a flicker, right?\n\n269\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.410\nIt could be damaged.\n\n270\n00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.640\nA lot of times it's a loose connections\nagain whether it's field serviceable or\n\n271\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.690\nnot, you have to check\nwith the manufacturer.\n\n272\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.130\nAnd another thing too is keep in\nmind if you're paying for a warranty\n\n273\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.410\nDon't put your superhero outfit on and\ntry to open it up, send it back to them.\n\n274\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.730\nThere's a time to be a tech and\nthere's a time to be smart, all right.\n\n275\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.005\nWell you should be smart being a tech\ntoo or you get yourself in trouble.\n\n276\n00:13:36.005 --> 00:13:39.160\n[LAUGH] Always be smart,\nright, use your warranty.\n\n277\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.410\nLet them be the technicians,\nthat's what you paid for the warranty,\n\n278\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.800\nit's why you have a warranty.\n\n279\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.609\nDon't forget to use it.\n\n280\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.220\nAll right, Dan, what are some of\nthe other things in this laundry list?\n\n281\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.480\nWe have sticking keys.\n\n282\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.830\nAll right.\nWhen it comes to sticking keys,\n\n283\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:56.240\na lot of times our devices today\nhave a non-tactile touch screen.\n\n284\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.680\nIf you happen to have whether it's\na laptop, and I know this is really using\n\n285\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.850\nthe laptop section, but if happens\nto be a laptop it could be debris.\n\n286\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.100\n&gt;&gt; Well laptops are considered\nmobile devices, yeah.\n\n287\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.410\n&gt;&gt; They really are, and it's kind of\ninteresting because we say mobile devices,\n\n288\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.900\nyou're absolutely correct, but\nthey don't call laptops out here, right?\n\n289\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.100\nSo, absolutely.\n\n290\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.990\nAnd sticking keys, it's really gonna\nbe only a laptop today, right?\n\n291\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.870\nBecause I just said that, and\nI know Blackberry is out there.\n\n292\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.110\nI know they still have we call the turn\nand burn phones, the flip phones,\n\n293\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.310\nyou know, track phones are out there.\n\n294\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.870\nSo yes, you could and\na lot of times it's just debris, you know,\n\n295\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.670\ndirt, grime or dust.\n\n296\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.531\n&gt;&gt; So put it in the dishwasher.\n\n297\n00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:33.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n298\n00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.500\n&gt;&gt; Fix it right up.\n\n299\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.590\n&gt;&gt; Put it in the dishwasher.\n\n300\n00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So one of the things to\n\n301\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.520\nkeep in mind too is that\nsometimes your touchscreens.\n\n302\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.770\nYou look at the keyboard and\nyou've pushed a button on the keyboard and\n\n303\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.110\nit sticks, reboot the phone.\n\n304\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.260\nRight, it just could be a memory hang,\ncould be an application hang,\n\n305\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.230\ncould be the operating\nsystem is hanging there.\n\n306\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.420\nI've actually seen that too.\n\n307\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.450\nIts kinda interesting the lack of\na key and it's still sticking.\n\n308\n00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.680\nWhat else do we got?\n\n309\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.280\nDamage to the plastic hinges.\n\n310\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.530\nIf it happens to be one that you\ncan again tactilely depress,\n\n311\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.480\nkeep in mind you have to be very careful.\n\n312\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.170\nSome people will tell you, just pop\nthe key off, use a little cotton swab and\n\n313\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.920\na little bit of rubbing alcohol,\nvery lightly moistened, right, and\n\n314\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.710\nkind of rub it, rub the grime out.\n\n315\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.810\nYou've got to be careful because\nyou'll see that these swivel,\n\n316\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.770\nthey actually swivel in pieces like this.\n\n317\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.120\nThe little braces can be\na nightmare to get back on.\n\n318\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.200\nIn fact,\none of the laptops that my wife had when\n\n319\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.720\nmy oldest son was Just a baby he loved.\n\n320\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.330\nThe first thing he'd do,\nhe'd walk over and he'd grab a key and\n\n321\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.170\nhe'd pop it right off.\n\n322\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.290\nHe just loved doing that.\n\n323\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.410\nSo over the years of using that laptop,\nwe ended up having quite a few keys that\n\n324\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.420\nwere missing and so finally we ended\nup having to get rid of the laptop.\n\n325\n00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.230\nAnd that's because the plastic hinges.\n\n326\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.220\nThe little hinges that the cover pops\ninto broke and then at that point,\n\n327\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.160\nthere's really nothing that you can\ndo to actually put them back on.\n\n328\n00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.450\nSo sticking keys can happen.\n\n329\n00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.270\nBattery not charging.\n\n330\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.712\nMany of you guys have probably seen this.\n\n331\n00:15:58.712 --> 00:16:02.598\nAnd before I even get into some of the\nthings that I've written down, I'm gonna\n\n332\n00:16:02.598 --> 00:16:06.489\nget props over to our chat room cause our\nchat room's got a great one right here.\n\n333\n00:16:06.489 --> 00:16:10.321\nIt says you got lint in pocket,\nlike pocket lint,\n\n334\n00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:15.175\nhow about we try that reversed\nthat [LAUGH] pocket lint, right?\n\n335\n00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:20.140\nOr dirt, and it's right in the charging\nport where you plug the charging cable\n\n336\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.545\nin and it blocks the electrical\nconnection, right?\n\n337\n00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:25.317\n&gt;&gt; It's like the bellybutton\nof the device.\n\n338\n00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.109\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nthat's absolutely, yes [LAUGH].\n\n339\n00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:27.729\n&gt;&gt; It's got lint in there.\n\n340\n00:16:27.729 --> 00:16:30.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah, and we've got to\ngive props to the chatroom again for\n\n341\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.760\nthat one there, cuz that's right.\n\n342\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.206\nAny debris that's in the charging port\nitself, you don't make a good contact,\n\n343\n00:16:36.206 --> 00:16:37.535\nyou're not gonna get charge.\n\n344\n00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:43.255\nNow this could be the battery failing too,\nremember if any kind of battery.\n\n345\n00:16:43.255 --> 00:16:44.995\nIt doesn't have to be\na fast charging battery,\n\n346\n00:16:44.995 --> 00:16:47.475\nit doesn't have to a slow\ncharging battery, normal.\n\n347\n00:16:47.475 --> 00:16:49.345\nQualcomm has the rapid charge and stuff.\n\n348\n00:16:49.345 --> 00:16:52.565\nIf the battery isn't charging,\nthe battery, it's kinda like,\n\n349\n00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:55.630\nif you understand what's going\non when you're putting a charge.\n\n350\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.140\nYou're flexing the muscles of the battery.\n\n351\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.710\nEventually it's going to die, it won't\nbe able to hold that charge anymore.\n\n352\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.720\nSo it could be a failing battery,\nall right?\n\n353\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.420\nThe charger could be failing too, I've had\nmany of those wall warts we call them.\n\n354\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.670\nWe joke around and\nwe call them wall warts,\n\n355\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.640\nI've seen many of the wall\nchargers that have just failed.\n\n356\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.710\nI've had quite a few\ntablets over the years and\n\n357\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.220\nthey all pick on me around here because\nI think I've had four or five iPads.\n\n358\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.440\nI've had quite a few Android tablets,\nand the chargers failed.\n\n359\n00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.255\nThe other thing too is the cables\nthat connect to the charger,\n\n360\n00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:25.295\nthe cables fail too.\n\n361\n00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.125\nIf you have a micro USB connector or\n\n362\n00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:30.365\nif you have some proprietary\nconnector like a lighting connector.\n\n363\n00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:33.545\nOr the iPads used to have\nthat 15 pin connector for\n\n364\n00:17:33.545 --> 00:17:36.205\na while, they're all pretty\nmuch the lighting connector.\n\n365\n00:17:36.205 --> 00:17:40.615\nYou might have a proprietary charging\ncable or a proprietary port, and\n\n366\n00:17:40.615 --> 00:17:43.535\nthose cables fail too,\nthe cables themselves.\n\n367\n00:17:43.535 --> 00:17:46.700\nNow the other thing you also have to\nkeep in mind is that the chargers,\n\n368\n00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.360\nAndroid's really good about this,\nI really like this.\n\n369\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.500\nAndroid's good about this and\n\n370\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.780\nthe fact that you can almost swap any\nbasic Android charger that's a micro USB.\n\n371\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.820\nAnd it's going to support\nmost of your Android devices.\n\n372\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.090\nApple only until recently has\nstarted to license out to\n\n373\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.340\nmanufacturers the ability to make charging\ncables for the Apple-based devices.\n\n374\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.890\nAnd it's a quality control thing,\nI'm not here to pass any judgment here.\n\n375\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.570\nI'm sure on their thought process,\nand some of the articles and\n\n376\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.400\nforums that I've read.\n\n377\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.230\nIs they want to make sure that it's good,\n\n378\n00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.750\nclean, quality electricity that\nis going into their devices.\n\n379\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.870\nBecause of some of the warranties\nthat they place on them, right?\n\n380\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.830\nThey want to make sure that it\nisn't a manufacturer defect, okay?\n\n381\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.150\nSo keep in mind that just because\nyou potentially have a cable that\n\n382\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.920\nplugs in to a micro USB port doesn't\nmean that it's a charging cable.\n\n383\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.120\nI've seen these really thin\ncables that are actually,\n\n384\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.580\nthey're just data cables,\nthey put no electrical power behind them.\n\n385\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.540\nSo if the battery is failing to charge\nmake sure that you don't just have\n\n386\n00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.460\nthe basic charging cable, right?\n\n387\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:51.970\nOr I'm sorry,\n\n388\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.850\na basic data cable that doesn't\nhave the charging capabilities too.\n\n389\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.630\nWhat else?\n\n390\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.540\nAC power source, right?\n\n391\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.125\nIf you're [LAUGH] if you're plugging\nyour charger into an AC outlet, and\n\n392\n00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:05.040\nthat AC outlet's failed.\n\n393\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.820\nAgain, simple fixes,\nquestion the obvious, even on this exam.\n\n394\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.910\nCould be the DC jack itself,\nall right, the DC jack.\n\n395\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.110\nSo we'll go back to our chatroom where\nthey talked about pocket lint and\n\n396\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.400\ndirt in the charging port, you know?\n\n397\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.290\nOne of the easiest fixes for\nnon-charging, to quote it exactly, right?\n\n398\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.210\nWell if the DC jack has failed,\nthat can happen,\n\n399\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.840\nthat can also cause a lack of\ncharge as well, all right.\n\n400\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.580\nIf you're using some kind of power bank,\nI love power banks.\n\n401\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.580\nI got an extended power bank and when we\ntook a trip across seas out to Auckland\n\n402\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.222\nand Australia a couple of years a go,\nit was one of the best things I had.\n\n403\n00:19:40.222 --> 00:19:42.080\nWell is the power bank,\ndid it lose its charge?\n\n404\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.789\nCuz if it loses its charge then your\nbattery is gonna fail to charge.\n\n405\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.030\nAll right, so I'm going to ahead and\nI know I'm skipping around just one here\n\n406\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.770\nbecause they call out\nanother one called no power.\n\n407\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.630\nAnd since we're talking about power,\nlet's go ahead and talk about that one.\n\n408\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.480\nIf it's no power it could\nbe a battery issue,\n\n409\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.950\nit could be a charging issue, it could\nbe the device is turned off, right?\n\n410\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.980\nThe other thing too to keep in mind,\nif you are changing batteries out,\n\n411\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.980\nmaybe you have had to replace the battery.\n\n412\n00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.290\nMake sure that you have got good,\nclean electrical contacts.\n\n413\n00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.310\nIf the electrical contacts\nthat the battery makes\n\n414\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.130\nbasically a connection to the phone or\nthe device has failed.\n\n415\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.750\nOr it's got grime on it\nthat can cause problems.\n\n416\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.690\nNow sometimes in the tablets and\nstuff like that you don't open up,\n\n417\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.870\nthe battery's all internal and there's\nnothing you can do to replace them.\n\n418\n00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.720\nSo it's also recommended to check\nout whatever the manufacturer\n\n419\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.820\nsays you should do, all right?\n\n420\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.240\nAnd it could be a damaged device,\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n421\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.670\nyou might have no power just because,\nwell, the device is completely damaged.\n\n422\n00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.960\nAnd unfortunately you have\nto kind of check out,\n\n423\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.879\ndo you have a field-servicable part\nversus a non-field-servicable part.\n\n424\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.360\nAll right, now they call out some\ninteresting things that really have to do\n\n425\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.770\nwith, for instance, the pointers\nthat you see on these devices.\n\n426\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.950\nThis happens a lot in laptops,\nor can happen in laptops, and\n\n427\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.625\nthat's ghost cursor and pointer drift.\n\n428\n00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:08.420\nDan, I used to have one of the older\nThinkPads before they went to Lenovo and\n\n429\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.030\nit was back when they were still IBM.\n\n430\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.435\nAnd I remember you had\nthe little pencil eraser,\n\n431\n00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:15.625\nthe track point right in\nthe middle of the keyboard.\n\n432\n00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:20.650\nAnd I remember as the computer when\nturn on and the mouse pointer would be\n\n433\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.822\nrendered in the operating system,\nI think it was Windows XP.\n\n434\n00:21:22.822 --> 00:21:27.010\nThat pointer would just start to drift\nto the side, drift to the side, and\n\n435\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.870\nI learned later that you\ncould calibrate them.\n\n436\n00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.100\nAt the time, I didn't know,\nI'm like, Ben, that is annoying, but\n\n437\n00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.720\nit could also be debris.\n\n438\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.660\nIf you do have something like\nthat like a track point system,\n\n439\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.390\nit could be debris and\nyou might need to clean it out.\n\n440\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.372\nIf it's a ghost cursor,\nthe ghost cursor again,\n\n441\n00:21:44.372 --> 00:21:47.990\nthis could be essentially\nsome kind of driver issue.\n\n442\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.680\nIf you have for instance a digitizer, this\ncould be some kind of battery failure.\n\n443\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.280\nIf you're using a wireless dongle for\n\n444\n00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.260\na digitizer,\ncould be a failure on that issue.\n\n445\n00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.090\nYou might need to reinstall\nthe driver itself,\n\n446\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.544\nif you feel that the driver\ncould be causing the issue.\n\n447\n00:22:03.544 --> 00:22:06.000\nIt could be compatibility issues too.\n\n448\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.640\nStylus interaction, you might have to just\nrecalibrate the device itself, right?\n\n449\n00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.560\nOr you could, if it's a touch screen,\n\n450\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.430\nit's causing problems, you might need to\nclean the screen with a lint free cloth.\n\n451\n00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.580\nNow, I know most of us around here\npretty much have some kind of\n\n452\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.020\ncase around our phones right?\n\n453\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.625\nI go to the extreme because\nI am known to break things,\n\n454\n00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.200\n[LAUGH] everybody else\nknows that around here.\n\n455\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.748\nSo I've got a pretty heavy hand when\nit comes to pretty much everything,\n\n456\n00:22:32.748 --> 00:22:33.720\n[LAUGH] some things around here.\n\n457\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.510\nSo I go with an OtterBox case and\nthe OtterBox case that I have actually has\n\n458\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.620\nthe whole plastic sleeving\nencases the phone.\n\n459\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.500\nWell, here's the thing, when I put that\nphone in my pocket and I leave it there\n\n460\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.210\nand here in Florida we're not lax for\nsun or hot temperatures out there.\n\n461\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.410\nI start to sweat, and I get a little\nbit of water in between the screen and\n\n462\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.870\nthe touch screen, and\nthe pointer drifts all over the place.\n\n463\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.130\nWell, it's not really a pointer,\nbut it doesn't interact well,\n\n464\n00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.930\nI start getting things that\nare turning on and closing down.\n\n465\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.880\nSo might need to take the case off and you\nmight have to clean the screen as well.\n\n466\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.260\nIf you're one of these ones that,\nlike Dan and some of the other people,\n\n467\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.520\nwho have actually the protective\ncover that's placed over and\n\n468\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.500\nattaches, like it has\nan adhesive to the screen.\n\n469\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.236\nIf you get any debris or bubbles in\nbetween there that can cause problems and\n\n470\n00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:25.880\nit can cause problems with\nthe interaction of the device itself.\n\n471\n00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.513\nAll right, so the other thing that they\ntalk about too is your numerical lock,\n\n472\n00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:37.285\nnumlock they call it, numeric lock,\nnumlock indicator lights.\n\n473\n00:23:37.285 --> 00:23:40.615\nIf you happen to see that those are turned\non, a lot of times that's a keyboard\n\n474\n00:23:40.615 --> 00:23:43.599\nshortcut with a function key on\na laptop that you've maybe pressed.\n\n475\n00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:46.383\nAnd now you're getting some\nkinda alternate output,\n\n476\n00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:48.330\njust check the function key, right?\n\n477\n00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.319\nIf it's something that you always have\nto press a keyboard shortcut to happen,\n\n478\n00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:54.759\nmaybe you're pressing two\nkeys at one time, and\n\n479\n00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:57.155\nagain you're getting\nthat alternate output.\n\n480\n00:23:57.155 --> 00:24:01.055\nIf it's a light that is continuously on,\nagain, you might just have to\n\n481\n00:24:01.055 --> 00:24:05.418\npress a keyboard shortcut to turn it off\nto make sure that that doesn't happen.\n\n482\n00:24:05.418 --> 00:24:10.404\nAll right, now the next series\nof things that we have are for\n\n483\n00:24:10.404 --> 00:24:14.417\ninstance some networking issues,\nall right?\n\n484\n00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:16.880\nAnd there are tons of networking issues.\n\n485\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.010\nSo keep in mind, we talked about\nnetwork troubleshooting here.\n\n486\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.010\nSo I'm gonna kinda brief over\nsome of these and go back and\n\n487\n00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.740\nlook at our networking section if you need\na little bit more information on them.\n\n488\n00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:28.780\nComes to mobile devices.\n\n489\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.780\nThey talk about intermittent wireless,\nright?\n\n490\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.240\nWe talk about intermittent wireless,\n\n491\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.560\nthe first thing you need to check\nis proximity to your access point.\n\n492\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.920\nBecause guess what,\nif you're too far from your access point,\n\n493\n00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.250\nyou might start losing signal, right?\n\n494\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:46.249\nYou might get that intermittent signal\nas you basically go out of the reach\n\n495\n00:24:46.249 --> 00:24:48.193\nof the access point itself.\n\n496\n00:24:48.193 --> 00:24:50.605\nIt could be wireless antenna damage,\nright?\n\n497\n00:24:50.605 --> 00:24:54.032\nIf you've dropped any device, you could\nhave a wireless antenna in there that has\n\n498\n00:24:54.032 --> 00:24:56.530\nactually been damaged or\nthe card itself has been damaged.\n\n499\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.510\nA lot of times in mobile devices that we\nhave here outside of a laptop environment\n\n500\n00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.690\neven with the laptops,\nyou can't replace the wireless card.\n\n501\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.030\nYou'll see in our laptop section\nthat Dan and I did, that we did have\n\n502\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.550\na removable wireless card with\nan antenna that went around the display.\n\n503\n00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.942\nSo that could be changed out.\n\n504\n00:25:11.942 --> 00:25:16.060\nIt could be repaired or\njust completely replaced.\n\n505\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.080\nHowever within some of your mobile\ndevices, you don't have that ability.\n\n506\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.740\nIt could be obstacles.\n\n507\n00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.199\nObstacles are in the way between you and\nwhatever the access point is, the signal.\n\n508\n00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:28.800\nIt could be radio frequency interference,\nright?\n\n509\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.962\nMicrowaves, other cordless phones,\ncellphones if you will, high\n\n510\n00:25:32.962 --> 00:25:37.930\nintensity discharge lamps, if your access\npoint happens to be near one of those.\n\n511\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.900\nSo you might need to think about your AP,\nyour access point placement.\n\n512\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.280\nReposition the access point or\nthe antenna placement.\n\n513\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.326\nI don't know Dan if you've\nhad to do this before, but\n\n514\n00:25:47.326 --> 00:25:49.891\nI've got dipole antennas on the back\nof an ASUS router that I have.\n\n515\n00:25:49.891 --> 00:25:52.458\nAnd the connection points get loose, and\n\n516\n00:25:52.458 --> 00:25:56.283\nI come in and all the antennas\nare pointing down to the ground.\n\n517\n00:25:56.283 --> 00:25:58.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\ndefinitely will happen from time to time.\n\n518\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.970\nJust not getting quite the coverage\nthat you expect at that point.\n\n519\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.266\n&gt;&gt; It's like wow,\nI can't tell why I'm not getting coverage.\n\n520\n00:26:03.266 --> 00:26:05.671\nWell, that's because it's\npointing behind the dresser.\n\n521\n00:26:05.671 --> 00:26:09.385\n[LAUGH] All right, so,\nagain that something that can happen too.\n\n522\n00:26:09.385 --> 00:26:12.273\nSo some of the solution is that I\nmove closer to the access point.\n\n523\n00:26:12.273 --> 00:26:15.065\nYou say well, I am as close to\nthe access point as I can get.\n\n524\n00:26:15.065 --> 00:26:16.360\nWell here's another\nthing that you can get.\n\n525\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.308\nIt's relatively easy today to install\na wireless range extender, right?\n\n526\n00:26:19.308 --> 00:26:22.320\nThen get them where you can just\nplug them right into a wall outlet.\n\n527\n00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.000\nYou push a button on them and it looks for\nanother wireless access point and\n\n528\n00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.090\nit seamlessly connects.\n\n529\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.975\nAnd it makes it a lot easier,\nit can extend the coverage area.\n\n530\n00:26:29.975 --> 00:26:34.122\nCould start to alleviate some of\nthe intermittent wireless access.\n\n531\n00:26:34.122 --> 00:26:37.349\nYou say, well, wait a second,\nI wouldn't know where in my building, or\n\n532\n00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:38.610\nwhere in my home to put that.\n\n533\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.330\nWell, that's great.\n\n534\n00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.921\nPull out your mobile phone, and\nfind applications like Wi-Fi Analyzer,\n\n535\n00:26:42.921 --> 00:26:45.657\nthat allow you to look at what\nthe signal strength is, and\n\n536\n00:26:45.657 --> 00:26:48.230\ntake that on your device and\nwalk through your house.\n\n537\n00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.758\nAnd if the decibels start to decrease,\nwell guess what?\n\n538\n00:26:51.758 --> 00:26:53.380\nThat's the gain,\nthat's the signal strength,\n\n539\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.335\nthat's the area you're gonna have to\nplace the wireless range extender.\n\n540\n00:26:56.335 --> 00:26:58.650\nSo a lot of great things\nthat they make it easy for\n\n541\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.980\nus to overcome some of these issues today,\nwhere in\n\n542\n00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.590\npast experience it would be very expensive\nand sometimes very technical to do.\n\n543\n00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.790\nToday they've got almost.\n\n544\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.530\nAnd I wanna say plug and\nplay because we got a technology\n\n545\n00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.800\nthat is specifically plug and\nplay, but it's very close, right?\n\n546\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.820\nPlug and enjoy if you will.\n\n547\n00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.178\nWell, we'll make up our own terms here.\n\n548\n00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:21.205\nSo remove obstacles if you can.\n\n549\n00:27:21.205 --> 00:27:23.495\nIs not necessarily that\nyou can just sit there and\n\n550\n00:27:23.495 --> 00:27:27.965\ntake out a load bearing wall because\nyou're not getting wireless access.\n\n551\n00:27:27.965 --> 00:27:29.105\nBut it might be something.\n\n552\n00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:31.405\nAgain, if it's a radio\nfrequency interference,\n\n553\n00:27:31.405 --> 00:27:35.847\nthat might be something that's suspected,\njust move the access point if you can.\n\n554\n00:27:35.847 --> 00:27:38.329\nAll right, no wireless connectivity.\n\n555\n00:27:38.329 --> 00:27:43.340\nAll our basic wireless are troubleshooting\nthings that go on, right?\n\n556\n00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.580\nIt could be the wireless adapter itself is\ndisabled, it could be in airplane mode.\n\n557\n00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.680\nYou could have security settings that are\na mismatch, right, encryption mismatch.\n\n558\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.928\nIt could be the fact that maybe\nyour company or your house,\n\n559\n00:27:54.928 --> 00:27:58.791\nyou've got enabled things like MAC\nfiltering and your not allowed.\n\n560\n00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:02.434\nIt's like a blacklist, which means if\nyour on this list you can't connect.\n\n561\n00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:05.004\nOr your doing white listing\nwhich gets difficult as well,\n\n562\n00:28:05.004 --> 00:28:07.995\nbecause you're saying anything on\nthis list with this media access\n\n563\n00:28:07.995 --> 00:28:09.994\ncontrol address can\nconnect to the network.\n\n564\n00:28:09.994 --> 00:28:13.600\nAnd if your not on this list, sorry,\nno reservations at the restaurant for you.\n\n565\n00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.165\nYou might have to disable that.\n\n566\n00:28:15.165 --> 00:28:18.230\nThere might be something that somebody got\nin there and then like let's go ahead and\n\n567\n00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.890\nmake it secure.\n\n568\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.286\nRemember, as you guys go along on\nyour training here at CompTIA,\n\n569\n00:28:22.286 --> 00:28:25.435\nwhether it's A plus, net plus,\nsecurity plus and beyond,\n\n570\n00:28:25.435 --> 00:28:27.564\nwe always talk about security, right?\n\n571\n00:28:27.564 --> 00:28:29.570\nYeah, I want the securest\nnetwork possible.\n\n572\n00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.160\nWell, it's gonna be probably the most\ninconvenient network as well too.\n\n573\n00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.540\nSo there's always a fine balance there.\n\n574\n00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.920\nHidden SSID,\nremember the Service Set Identifier.\n\n575\n00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.910\nIf for security purposes you\ndisable the broadcasting of your\n\n576\n00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.430\nService Set Identifier,\na lot of times what you're doing is only\n\n577\n00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.930\nkeeping the legitimate\npeople out of your network.\n\n578\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.492\nA lot of times you're doing\nvery little to stop a hacker.\n\n579\n00:28:48.492 --> 00:28:51.609\nAll right, and that means you'll\nhave to know what the SSID is,\n\n580\n00:28:51.609 --> 00:28:55.191\nknow that the access point is turned\non and manually configure it inside of\n\n581\n00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:58.230\nthe wireless adapter in whatever\ndevice it is that connects.\n\n582\n00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.054\nIt doesn't matter if it's a laptop,\n\n583\n00:29:00.054 --> 00:29:04.500\ndoesn't matter if it's a work station that\nhas a wireless adapter installed in it.\n\n584\n00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.575\nStandard mismatches, right?\n\n585\n00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:08.299\n802.11, no wireless communications.\n\n586\n00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:11.918\nKeep in mind that when we talk\nabout wireless communications,\n\n587\n00:29:11.918 --> 00:29:17.820\nif you got an 802.11N network, right, you\ncould support all the protocols, right?\n\n588\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.410\nBut if you have an AC network,\nyou can support N and that's it, right?\n\n589\n00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.470\nUnless it's got a dual band radio,\nbut that's for another day.\n\n590\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.510\nSo, that's some of\nthe things that can do it.\n\n591\n00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.020\nI already mentioned airplane mode.\n\n592\n00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:35.666\nRemember to enable the wireless adapter,\nreconfigure security settings.\n\n593\n00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.799\nMake sure that you have\nstandard compatibility,\n\n594\n00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:41.570\nreposition the access\npoint if you need to.\n\n595\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.430\nAnd last but not least, go ahead and\nturn off airplane mode.\n\n596\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.955\nNow Dan, that is a lot of information\nwhen it comes to mobile devices.\n\n597\n00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:51.920\nBut I'm looking at my list buddy, and\nI have just scratched the surface.\n\n598\n00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.140\nSo, I don't know if we have\nenough time in this episode.\n\n599\n00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.509\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's not a problem my man.\n\n600\n00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:57.433\nWe'll just roll into our part two for\nyou and\n\n601\n00:29:57.433 --> 00:29:59.740\nour good folks out there\nthat are watching.\n\n602\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.550\nSo definitely join us back for that, but\n\n603\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.420\nit does look like we are at\nthe end of this one.\n\n604\n00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.630\nSo we're gonna sign off.\n\n605\n00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.960\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n606\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:06.240\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.154\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.380\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.955\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:16.098\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:19.447\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:22.480\nwell, we are continuing in our A+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.760\nIt is that long.\n\n11\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.490\nThere's a lot of information for\nus to cover and\n\n12\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.740\nthey do that intentionally cuz they\nwant you to have a very broad scope of\n\n13\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.170\nknowledge when it comes to\nbeing an A+ technician.\n\n14\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.820\nAnd guess what?\n\n15\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.890\nWe've got someone here that's helping lead\nthat charge, so that we can have that\n\n16\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.160\nknowledge imparted into our brains,\nit is our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n17\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.850\nWes, we are so glad to have you again.\n\n18\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.370\nHow's it going, sir?\n\n19\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.260\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n20\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.888\nI think it's an Aerosmith song I could\nthink of going on in the back of my head,\n\n21\n00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:47.112\nTrain Keep Rolling All Night Long.\n\n22\n00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does.\n[LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.984\n&gt;&gt; It is rolling for sure.\n\n24\n00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:52.347\nAnd that's right,\nwe are continuing on in mobile devices.\n\n25\n00:00:52.347 --> 00:00:55.690\nAnd there is a laundry list of the things\nthat could potentially come up\n\n26\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.658\nwhen it comes to your different mobile\ndevices, and really ladies and gentlemen,\n\n27\n00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:03.285\nit doesn't matter if we're talking\nlaptops, if we're talking tablets,\n\n28\n00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:04.499\nfablets, e-readers.\n\n29\n00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:09.320\nAll different things, cell phones,\nsmart phones if you will.\n\n30\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.790\nWe kind of just rolling them\nall into one big pile here\n\n31\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.550\nwhen we talk about mobile devices.\n\n32\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.580\nKeep in mind some of the other things that\nwe talked about in the first part, really\n\n33\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.320\nthe main thing that I'd like to recap is\nthat some devices are field serviceable or\n\n34\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700\ncomponents within this devices\nI'd say are field serviceable.\n\n35\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.060\nSome are not,\nsome things you just can't replace, and\n\n36\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.120\nkeep in mind that some things\nyou can't upgrade either.\n\n37\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.990\nFor instance, NAND flash memory is\ntypically built into the motherboards or\n\n38\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.352\nthe PCBs, the printed circuit boards,\nthat are in these devices.\n\n39\n00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:45.710\nWhen you talk about system on a chip where\neverything's built into the circuit board\n\n40\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.530\nitself, we can't replace them, right?\n\n41\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.690\nIf it's external storage and\nyou have a space, if you will, for\n\n42\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.420\nthings like your micro SD cards, well\nthen you could probably expand storage.\n\n43\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.220\nSo again, some things you can replace,\nsome things you can upgrade,\n\n44\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.810\nother things are not field serviceable,\n\n45\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.440\nwhich means if they become damaged,\nyou have to replace the device outright.\n\n46\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.990\nAll right so that being said, let's go\nahead and continue on in our list here,\n\n47\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.610\nwe left off and\n\n48\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.240\nwe were talking a little bit about\nsome of the networking communications.\n\n49\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.399\nWe talked about troubleshooting,\nreally wireless.\n\n50\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.680\nHowever, when we were\ntalking about wireless,\n\n51\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.050\nreally what we were talking about\nwas the WiFi side of things.\n\n52\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.515\nWhat we didn't talk about are some of\nthings that you can see when it comes to\n\n53\n00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:30.200\nbluetooth, and I wanna mention just\nbriefly, cellular communications as well.\n\n54\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.590\nAll right, when it comes to bluetooth,\nremember bluetooth is a very short range,\n\n55\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.780\nvery easy to configure\nwireless connection.\n\n56\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.350\nOperates in the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum\nof the industrial, scientifical and\n\n57\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.270\nmedical band ISM.\n\n58\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.430\nMost of your devices today,\n\n59\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.360\nmobile devices,\nwill support some Bluetooth capabilities.\n\n60\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.160\nHowever, as the Bluetooth has gone on,\n\n61\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.060\nit's become less power hungry\nthan it was in the earlier days.\n\n62\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.780\nIn fact, if we were teaching this\nfive years ago or even prior to that,\n\n63\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.630\nI would have been telling you, well,\nif you're not using Bluetooth,\n\n64\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.030\nyou really should be turning it off.\n\n65\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.858\nBecause of the fact that it'll drain\nyour battery considerably faster with it\n\n66\n00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:07.440\nturned on.\n\n67\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.550\nNow, there could still\nbe something to that and\n\n68\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.370\nthe fact that any unused connection\ndoes have a potential for\n\n69\n00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.270\na security vulnerability, that somebody\ncould try to piggy back off of, right?\n\n70\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.027\nBut we'll try talk about security in other\nepisodes, but I do want you to remember\n\n71\n00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:24.083\nthat If you're not using Bluetooth,\nwell go ahead, turn it off.\n\n72\n00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:27.669\nYou could save and extend your battery\nlife which is one of those major concerns\n\n73\n00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.808\nwhen it comes to affordability and\nmobility of these devices.\n\n74\n00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:34.240\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, so obviously Bluetooth\nis a major player here as something that\n\n75\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.171\nwe're gonna run into as an A+ technician.\n\n76\n00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:39.690\nWhat are some of the common\nconnectivity issues we might encounter?\n\n77\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.100\n&gt;&gt; One of the first things I think of\nis just fat finger and the keyboard and\n\n78\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.610\nsome of those quick settings that you get\nto where you actually, you turn it off.\n\n79\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.680\nAnd if the adapter's turned off,\nwell you aren't gonna have any Bluetooth.\n\n80\n00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.000\nThe other thing that you can also keep in\nmind too is that some devices require,\n\n81\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.900\nwhen you turn Bluetooth on,\nit has to go into a pairing mode.\n\n82\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.100\nNow, most of the devices\nwhen you connect for\n\n83\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.330\nthe first time you have to pair\nit up with whatever the other\n\n84\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.560\ndevice is that it's gonna communicate\nover a bluetooth connection, right?\n\n85\n00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.810\nHowever, a lot of times\nit'll remember that, right?\n\n86\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.021\nIt'll keep it in memory that, hey,\nI've already paired up with this device.\n\n87\n00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.869\nSo, there's a couple of things that you\nmight have to keep in mind that if you\n\n88\n00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:18.161\nhave no bluetooth connectivity,\n\n89\n00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.272\nhave you ever gone through\nthe pairing process before?\n\n90\n00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:23.159\nAll right when we say go\ninto the pairing process,\n\n91\n00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:28.044\nhas that device entered into that little\ntrust relationship with the other device,\n\n92\n00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.420\nand if it has do you have\nto put in a security PIN?\n\n93\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.730\nThe PIN is something that you\nhave to keep in mind as well.\n\n94\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.330\nSome devices require you to put a little\nfour-digit code and sometimes they're just\n\n95\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.320\none of these things that is just\na default of four zeros, right?\n\n96\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.180\nSo pay attention to the manufacturer,\nI have seen where you have to put in some\n\n97\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.490\nkind of pin in order to\ncomplete the pairing process.\n\n98\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.370\nAnd if there's a lack of a PIN entry or\na PIN mismatch,\n\n99\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.820\nthat'll cause the communication\nnot to happen.\n\n100\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.290\nThe other thing is airplane mode.\n\n101\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.270\nKeep in mind when you\nturn on airplane mode,\n\n102\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.630\nit turns off wireless adapters,\nand that includes Bluetooth.\n\n103\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.262\nSo if you have Bluetooth enabled,\nyou know that you've communicated with\n\n104\n00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:13.817\nthe device before, but you still\ndon't have any Bluetooth connection,\n\n105\n00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:17.051\nhave you accidentally\npressed the airplane mode and\n\n106\n00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.821\nit's disabled those different\nwireless communications?\n\n107\n00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.620\nAll right so that is some of the things\nwhen we talk about different wireless\n\n108\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.620\ncommunications as well, they don't call\nit out here on the exam objectives.\n\n109\n00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.760\nI just wanna briefly mention this too with\nthe cellular communications likewise too.\n\n110\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.350\nThat's a setting right, so cellular\ncommunications obviously you can use\n\n111\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.220\nthe phone but\nmaybe you can't use the data plan right?\n\n112\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.810\nGranted you have to have a data plan and\n\n113\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.150\nif you do most of them\nhave data plans today.\n\n114\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.215\nYou just have to make sure that you\nhave the data setting turned on.\n\n115\n00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:53.230\nSo if you can't browse to like the\nInternet, and you expect that you should,\n\n116\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.400\nyou're trying to download an application,\nyou're trying to do an update and\n\n117\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.270\nthat's not happening, check to make\nsure wireless adapter's turned on.\n\n118\n00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.790\nIf you're doing this over WiFi, if you're\ntrying to do this on the road, over\n\n119\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.110\nthe cellular communication well away from\nyour wireless network, do make sure that\n\n120\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.680\nyou have that data setting turned on so\nthat you could do cellular communication.\n\n121\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.830\nThe other thing to keep in too is\nwhen you're roaming, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.250\nYou have to make sure that you're roaming\nwithin an area that your provider has\n\n123\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.240\ngiven you those roaming capabilities,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.570\nBecause it's not necessarily\nthe fact that, because you can't\n\n125\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.710\nconnect over the cellular network that\nthere's a lack of a cellular network.\n\n126\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.180\nIt might just be that maybe\nyou don't the technologies.\n\n127\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.663\nPrimarily today we're seeing some of\nthe 3G technologies and even the 4G\n\n128\n00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:42.450\ntechnology, LTE is very, very common\nto find out there as you're traveling.\n\n129\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.432\nSo a couple of things that you do have\nto keep in mind when it comes to your\n\n130\n00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:51.309\nwireless type communications, whether it\nbe WiFi, Bluetooth, or your cellular.\n\n131\n00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.940\nAll right so\nsome of the other things they talk about.\n\n132\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.610\nCannot display to an external monitor.\n\n133\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.552\nThis could be something a lot of times\nthat if we're talking about a wired\n\n134\n00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:02.738\nconnection in some of the older laptops\nyou'd have a little toggle switch that\n\n135\n00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:03.670\nyou'd have to press.\n\n136\n00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.540\nAnd if you didn't press\nit you couldn't extend or\n\n137\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.200\nsend the signal over the external wired\nconnection to whatever that monitor is.\n\n138\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.880\nHowever, keep in mind, not so much so\n\n139\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.020\ntoday in some of the newer\ngraphics adaptors.\n\n140\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.730\nBut you might have an older\ngraphics adapter, and it's lack of,\n\n141\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.450\nthe graphics adapter doesn't\nsupport external monitors.\n\n142\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.269\nThat's a rarity today, cuz most of\neven your basic processors today do\n\n143\n00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.930\nsupport that, or graphics adapters.\n\n144\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.708\nAnd the reason I say that\nyour basic processors,\n\n145\n00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:36.619\nI want you to know cuz we\ntalk about this in the mobile\n\n146\n00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:40.400\ndevices when we talk about the CPUs,\nthey're also called APUs.\n\n147\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.790\nAMD has this cleaver, marketing thing\nwhere they call it an accelerated\n\n148\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.240\nprocessing unit vs a CPU,\nit's still a CPU, but\n\n149\n00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.540\nwhat it does is it integrates the graphics\ncapability right into the data chip.\n\n150\n00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.877\nDon't think that that's something\nis lack on the Intel side too.\n\n151\n00:07:54.877 --> 00:07:58.597\nIntel's been doing this in the A-Series\nprocessors that Apple has and\n\n152\n00:07:58.597 --> 00:08:02.875\nSnapdragon for that matter That where the\ngraphics processing unit is built right\n\n153\n00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:05.670\ninto the CPU,\nit's literally in the die of the chip.\n\n154\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.660\nSo it's not a commonality that you\nwouldn't be able to extend it to\n\n155\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.660\nan external monitor.\n\n156\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.850\nOS configuration errors, this could be\nthe problem, too, if it's a laptop, right?\n\n157\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.630\nFor instance, if you're inside of Windows,\n\n158\n00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.380\nyou might have to go to the screen\nresolution settings, and\n\n159\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.480\nI say screen resolution settings,\nbecause that's in the operating system.\n\n160\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.600\nYou'll see,\nwhen we get into our 902 series,\n\n161\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.435\nwhere we have to detect and identify the\nexternal monitor, that could be something.\n\n162\n00:08:34.435 --> 00:08:38.415\nNow, the other thing is that I've been\ntalking about wired connection, all right.\n\n163\n00:08:38.415 --> 00:08:40.075\nYou also have a wireless connection,too,\n\n164\n00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:43.685\nthat allows us to extend whatever we're\nseeing on our device to an external\n\n165\n00:08:43.685 --> 00:08:46.880\nmonitor via something known\nas wi-fi direct, all right?\n\n166\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.490\nThe other thing that you\nhave too is air sharing.\n\n167\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.450\nMac allows you to do air sharing,\nwhich is basically like their WiFi direct\n\n168\n00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.750\ntype communication where I can take\nwhat I'm seeing on my display and\n\n169\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.230\nI can extend it out to a wireless\ndevice over the wireless network.\n\n170\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.940\nThere are a couple of things that have to\nbe in play for this functionality to work.\n\n171\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.294\nFirst of all, the device that you\nare looking at the screen, that you wanna\n\n172\n00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:14.527\nextend it to, or extend it from,\nthat device if it's my mobile device.\n\n173\n00:09:14.527 --> 00:09:17.592\nAnd I wanna do Wi-Fi Direct understand\nthat my device has to support\n\n174\n00:09:17.592 --> 00:09:19.130\nWi-Fi Direct.\n\n175\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.890\nA lot of the smart TVs that you use\ntoday support Wi-Fi Direct as well.\n\n176\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.650\nSo you have to make sure\nthat is turned on and\n\n177\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.840\nthere is pairing process a lot of times,\nso this has to happen too.\n\n178\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.250\nWhere you put a code that says hey do\nyou wanna allow the communications for\n\n179\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.460\nsecurity purposes, enter this pin.\n\n180\n00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.260\nThat has to happen so both ends of\nthe communications has to happen.\n\n181\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.290\nWell, how about the middle man, middle\nperson, middle woman if you will for\n\n182\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.180\nanalogy purposes.\n\n183\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.826\nThe access point has to support it\nnow too, and if it has the Wi-Fi\n\n184\n00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:50.088\nlogo on it that means it is a Wi-Fi\nalliance endorsed access point, right?\n\n185\n00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:51.767\nThat's why you It's good to look for\n\n186\n00:09:51.767 --> 00:09:54.270\nthe Wi-Fi logo that's\nstamped somewhere on the box.\n\n187\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.680\nBecause in order to be\nWi-Fi alliance endorsed,\n\n188\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.550\nto have that Wi-Fi signal,\nit has to support Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n189\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.340\nBut it might be something\nthat you have to turn on.\n\n190\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.840\nError sharing, inside of you Macs, allows\nyou to do the same functionality too.\n\n191\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.960\nYou have to make sure that if you go into\nthe Mac, you're whether it's a Mac book,\n\n192\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.460\nwhether it's an iPhone and or an iPad that\nyou have air sharing turned on as well.\n\n193\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.020\nAnd the same thing would go\nwith an FC type connections,\n\n194\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.325\nyour new fear communications like\nair drop and your iOS devices and\n\n195\n00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:28.650\nWiFi Direct as well,\ninside of your Android based devices too.\n\n196\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.560\nAll right, if you can't display to\nexternal monitor wire connection,\n\n197\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.770\ncould be damage to a wired cable, right?\n\n198\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.481\nIt could be a cable mismatch right,\nthat could cause problems too.\n\n199\n00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:41.654\nIt could be external monitor issue\nwhatever the external display\n\n200\n00:10:41.654 --> 00:10:44.200\nis that you're sending\ninto doesn't have issues.\n\n201\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.248\nAgain, that could be the problem too.\n\n202\n00:10:46.248 --> 00:10:50.005\nAll right, screen not responsive or\nnon-responsive,\n\n203\n00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:53.452\nthey put it more technically\nhere in objectives.\n\n204\n00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:57.050\nWe've kinda mention some of things,\nif you have a protective case\n\n205\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.500\nacross the outside and\nthere's a little bit of water or\n\n206\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.710\ndebris in between, whatever the protective\ncoating is and the actual touchscreen.\n\n207\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:10.580\nThis could be restricting your\nability to be able to communicate or\n\n208\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.500\ninteract with the touchscreen.\n\n209\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.940\nIf it's a capacitive touch,\nagain a capacitive touch, right?\n\n210\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.190\nIt could be the capacitors have failed,\nright?\n\n211\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.420\nIf it's a resistive touch, the resistive\nlayer could be damaged as well and\n\n212\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.760\nyou're not getting a communication there.\n\n213\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.350\nSome of the things that you can do,\nsometimes is just rebooting the device.\n\n214\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.520\nThere's been times where I've tried\nto interact with the touch screen.\n\n215\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.420\nI'm like, this thing isn't working or\nit's being very jittery, right?\n\n216\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.779\nYou press a button and\nyou then you wait a few seconds and\n\n217\n00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.582\nthen finally you see a few things open up.\n\n218\n00:11:37.582 --> 00:11:40.600\nJust reboot the device,\nthat can help a lot of times too.\n\n219\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.960\nYou can always clean the screen\nwith a lint free cloth.\n\n220\n00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.650\nAnd some devices even like\nyour ebook readers have\n\n221\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.500\nrecalibration software in them.\n\n222\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.630\nA lot of times the devices\ndo this themselves.\n\n223\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.520\nToday, we don't have to interact and\nlike we have in some of the earlier\n\n224\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.750\ntouch screens where you would\nhave to do a recalibration.\n\n225\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.860\nEspecially in the earlier tablet PCs,\nyou would have to do this a lot of times,\n\n226\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.740\nit's gonna be a self\ncalibration that happens, and\n\n227\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.200\nyou don't have to do this for your own.\n\n228\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.650\nAll right, so here are some other\nthings that we have to worry about too.\n\n229\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.770\nHow about apps not loading?\n\n230\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.580\nWell, there's quite a few things that\nyou know would cause an app not to load.\n\n231\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.939\nVery first thing that the app\nis not even on the device,\n\n232\n00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:19.956\nit isn't on the device to begin with,\nright?\n\n233\n00:12:19.956 --> 00:12:21.701\nSo if you've uninstalled an app,\n\n234\n00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:26.047\nthere have been times were I've seen icons\nleft behind and that app was uninstalled.\n\n235\n00:12:26.047 --> 00:12:29.645\nAll right, it's again becoming less and\nless common.\n\n236\n00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:32.625\nThey're getting really,\nreally good with the operating systems.\n\n237\n00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:35.605\nWe used to have this a lot in Windows\nwhere you'd remove an application, and\n\n238\n00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:39.685\nhave some generic icon that you hover over\nand it would say the application, but\n\n239\n00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:41.897\nit was just remembered In the registry.\n\n240\n00:12:41.897 --> 00:12:46.097\nToday, the registry's and\nthe configuration files,\n\n241\n00:12:46.097 --> 00:12:48.257\nthey do a pretty good job\nof cleaning themselves up.\n\n242\n00:12:48.257 --> 00:12:50.417\nAnd that's one of the reasons,\n\n243\n00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:54.587\neven though this isn't a security\ncentric episode, I want you to remember\n\n244\n00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:58.400\nthat it is good to download from\ntrusted installation sources.\n\n245\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.790\nWhether it's Google Play, Amazon App\nStore, whether it's the App Store for\n\n246\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.740\niTunes, not iTunes but in the Apple world.\n\n247\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.578\nAnd that's because they go\nthrough some checks and\n\n248\n00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:11.341\nbalances to make sure that when you\nwant to install an application,\n\n249\n00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:15.765\nit does remove itself completely from\nthe device, unlike some other potential\n\n250\n00:13:15.765 --> 00:13:19.549\nunknown applications or\nunknown sources that might not play nice.\n\n251\n00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.801\nAnd when it happens, they don't actually\ncompletely uninstall themselves,\n\n252\n00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:25.110\nlet alone what else they might be doing.\n\n253\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.080\nYou could have files that are actually\nmissing or corrupted in an application,\n\n254\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.050\nand that could cause it not to load.\n\n255\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.230\nHere's another thing that I've seen.\n\n256\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.990\nIf you try to offload some,\nto leave the internal storage for\n\n257\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.030\nthe device and\nyou offload the application,\n\n258\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.555\ngives you ability to move it\nover to external storage, right?\n\n259\n00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:44.040\nAnd you upgrade the storage card.\n\n260\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.020\nWell, what happens?\n\n261\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.740\nOn that old card,\n\n262\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.630\nyou still have some of the files that\ncontain that the application needs to run.\n\n263\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.160\nAnd when that's not present, guess what?\n\n264\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.370\nUnfortunately, the application's\nnot gonna load.\n\n265\n00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.730\nMalware, I don't like throwing\nmalware out there at the front\n\n266\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.310\nbecause if somebody assumes that if\nan application is not working or\n\n267\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.970\nit's causing problems\nit's gotta be malware.\n\n268\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.690\nNot necessarily, right?\n\n269\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.900\nThe more likelihood is that it's\nuser error before it's malware.\n\n270\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.660\nHowever, can never say never,\nand never can overlook it.\n\n271\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.490\nSome of the things you can do,\nrestart the application.\n\n272\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.830\nForce kill it, restart it,\nsee if it'll load, right?\n\n273\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.900\nIt could be memory issue\nit could be memory hag.\n\n274\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.470\nReinstall, uninstall the application\nif it still exists and reinstall it.\n\n275\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.546\nThat might be a good simple fix.\n\n276\n00:14:28.546 --> 00:14:32.830\nRun anti-malware software and I think I've\nalready mentioned this a few times now,\n\n277\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.910\nreboot the devices.\n\n278\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.457\nRemember, all your technical skills and\n\n279\n00:14:36.457 --> 00:14:39.668\nsometimes it only takes\na reboot to fix the problem.\n\n280\n00:14:39.668 --> 00:14:43.890\nI know it's sad but yet\ntrue at the same time.\n\n281\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.164\nSlow performance, all right.\n\n282\n00:14:45.164 --> 00:14:46.710\nWhen we talk about slow performance,\n\n283\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.078\nthere are a lot of things that\ncan cause slow performance,\n\n284\n00:14:49.078 --> 00:14:52.435\ndo you have too many applications running\non a device at a single time, all right?\n\n285\n00:14:52.435 --> 00:14:57.065\nMost of these devices actually work\nin what's known as a passive active\n\n286\n00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:59.150\nmode with their applications,\n\n287\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:04.190\nnot every device that you have is a true\nmulti-application running device.\n\n288\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.740\nLet me tell you what I mean here.\n\n289\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.921\nWhen you have an application that's loaded\ninto memory, and your memory starts\n\n290\n00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:13.927\nto get full in laptops that are running\nnormal full blown operating systems.\n\n291\n00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:17.133\nAnd I haven't dug down into some of\nthe Android and the iOS devices but\n\n292\n00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.540\nI can only imagine they're\ndoing this as well.\n\n293\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.150\nThey work on what's known as a swap file.\n\n294\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.968\nIn Windows we call it a page file.\n\n295\n00:15:23.968 --> 00:15:27.930\n&gt;&gt; You're page, your basically taking\na portion of the storage device in there,\n\n296\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.840\nand you're using it like it is physical\nRAM, Random Access Memory, right?\n\n297\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.440\nWell, let's say you're in Windows, right?\n\n298\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.910\nYou have two applications open\non your desktop, guess one?\n\n299\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.890\nThe one that's in focus is actually\nrunning at that current time.\n\n300\n00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.310\nYou can background\nprocess that is running.\n\n301\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.926\nNot every application is actually running\nbut it will lockdown the memory, right?\n\n302\n00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:49.910\nBecause you don't wanna\ncorrupt the information.\n\n303\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.888\nSo, if you have multiple\napplications open,\n\n304\n00:15:51.888 --> 00:15:54.895\nkeep in mind that the one that's in\nfocus might be running at the time.\n\n305\n00:15:54.895 --> 00:15:58.811\nBut the ones that are in the background\nare still consuming portions of your\n\n306\n00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.370\nRandom Access Memory in the device.\n\n307\n00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.426\nSo what do you need to do?\n\n308\n00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:04.630\nClose some of the applications down,\nright?\n\n309\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.080\nForce kill them, right?\nThere's usually of settings on.\n\n310\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.102\nEspecially in Android,\nin IOS that you can.\n\n311\n00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:14.370\nIn IOS I believe you can hold\nin the Home button, right?\n\n312\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.040\nAnd it separates all the applications\nthat are running and\n\n313\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.300\nyou just swipe them off the screen and\nyou shut them down, right?\n\n314\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.620\nI know in my Android device I've got a\nbutton next to the Home button if you will\n\n315\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.620\nthat I can hold in and it shows me all\nthe applications that are running and\n\n316\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.220\nI can just sit there and\nswipe them to the side and clear them.\n\n317\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.510\nSometimes you can scroll all the way down,\nyou got a clear all button, right and\n\n318\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.200\nit'll shut everyone of them down.\n\n319\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.640\nThat could be a problem.\n\n320\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.620\nYou could have a low battery, right?\n\n321\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.840\nRemember, mobile devices are all\nabout saving battery life or\n\n322\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.850\npreserving the consumption of\nthat battery power, right?\n\n323\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:50.170\nSo when you start to get a low battery,\nwhat happens is your CPUs go\n\n324\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.320\nthrough what's known as\na throttling process, right?\n\n325\n00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.920\nThrottling process is a stepping\ndown of the voltage or\n\n326\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.690\nstepping up of the voltage, right?\n\n327\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.600\nIntel's had this for a very long time.\n\n328\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.130\nAMD's got their,\nIntel's called SpeedStep, right?\n\n329\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.400\nSo if Intel based device\nit's called SpeedStep.\n\n330\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.080\nIt's been around for\n\n331\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.650\na very long time going all the way\nback to very early Pentium processors.\n\n332\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.433\nAMD's got their it's called PowerNow.\n\n333\n00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:14.520\nQualcomm has got their's and Snapdragon.\n\n334\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.756\nEverybody does it, right?\n\n335\n00:17:15.756 --> 00:17:20.680\nIt's basically, Intel called it for\na while multi voltage positioning, right?\n\n336\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.570\nA fancy way of saying hey, if you don't\nneed the processing power let's save your\n\n337\n00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.130\nbattery life and\nwe'll step down the voltages.\n\n338\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:32.120\nWhen you're losing battery, you're\ndevices a lot of times are configured to\n\n339\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.290\ndo everything they can to\nconserve the battery life and\n\n340\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.070\nthat could be causing\nslow performance as well.\n\n341\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.833\nNow, if you don't have a low battery\nlife or low battery at that point,\n\n342\n00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:44.152\nwhat you might have is just power\nsavings settings turned on, right?\n\n343\n00:17:44.152 --> 00:17:47.104\nIf you have those initiated even\nif you have a full battery,\n\n344\n00:17:47.104 --> 00:17:50.008\nit's going to manually throttle it,\nyou've done that.\n\n345\n00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:52.610\nSo you have to check the settings, right?\n\n346\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.150\nStorage is full, if the storage\non the device becomes full and\n\n347\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.310\nyou're using the external SD card in order\nto install your applications, or save your\n\n348\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:06.270\napplications, or to save consumption\nof the internal storage, guess what?\n\n349\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.190\nPerformance becomes slow.\n\n350\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.034\nI'm gonna skip over this one, I'm gonna\nsave it for last here [LAUGH] but\n\n351\n00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:16.670\nshut down some applications,\ncharge your battery,\n\n352\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.650\nturn off the battery-saving\nsettings if you will.\n\n353\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.720\nLast but not least, again,\nit could be malware.\n\n354\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.780\nI don't like putting malware\nfirst in everything,\n\n355\n00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.950\nbecause we always wanna go there.\n\n356\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.158\nMake sure that there\nare other things involved.\n\n357\n00:18:30.158 --> 00:18:33.684\nI'd hate to see you sit there and\nrun a malware scan for an hour and\n\n358\n00:18:33.684 --> 00:18:35.790\nhalf on a big, a lot of devices there.\n\n359\n00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.180\nAnd only to find out that, guess what?\n\n360\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.350\nYou've got the power saving\nbutton turned on and\n\n361\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.240\nthat's why you have slow performance, so\nuse malware as the last option, right?\n\n362\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.840\nAlways run it if you can, schedule scans\nby all means, I'm not saying don't be\n\n363\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.604\nsafe, but definitely be smart about it\nbecause those malware scans could take up,\n\n364\n00:18:51.604 --> 00:18:52.925\ncould take good long while.\n\n365\n00:18:52.925 --> 00:18:56.621\nOnly to learn that which is the fact that\nshe pressed the button on the home screen\n\n366\n00:18:56.621 --> 00:18:58.290\nthat put it in a power setting mode.\n\n367\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.302\nNext one, now I don't know that maybe too\nmany home users might have this problem,\n\n368\n00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:05.646\nbut you can definitely see\nit in businesses, right?\n\n369\n00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:09.210\nThey say unable to decrypt email, right?\n\n370\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.430\nIn a home environment,\n\n371\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:15.240\nyou might not have this as much unless\nyou're doing full device encryption, and\n\n372\n00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.140\nit doesn't matter if you're in business or\nif you're at home.\n\n373\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.626\nThen, that might be the fact that well\nmaybe it isn't your device, right?\n\n374\n00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:26.520\nThat a lot of times comes\ndown to an ownership thing.\n\n375\n00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.088\nHowever, in business environments when\nyou talk about can't decrypt your email,\n\n376\n00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.349\na lot of times you talk about\ncertificate problems and\n\n377\n00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:35.936\nwe don't really want to get into a public\nkey infrastructure certificates in this.\n\n378\n00:19:35.936 --> 00:19:40.736\nBut just understand you got a little\ndigital security file if you will\n\n379\n00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:45.800\nthat allows only you to encrypt\nthe information and decrypt it, right?\n\n380\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.099\nTo scramble it, so that if I scramble it,\nDon could get a hold of that email and\n\n381\n00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:51.565\nhe could read it, right?\n\n382\n00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:55.712\nBecause I'll also have that same little\ndigital security file that would allow me\n\n383\n00:19:55.712 --> 00:19:59.200\nto decrypt it, unscramble it,\nso that I could read it.\n\n384\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.070\nNow here's the problem, if I send that\nemail to Don and Don doesn't have access\n\n385\n00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.450\nto that little security mechanism,\nhe's not gonna be able to read it, right?\n\n386\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.820\nWe do this when use things like\nSMIME out there and as you guys on,\n\n387\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.910\nyou'll learned that's secure multi\nmedia internet mail extensions, right?\n\n388\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.050\nIt's a way that I can make\nsure that if I send Don\n\n389\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.750\nan encrypted email that only I want him to\nbe able to see, well I already reached and\n\n390\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.000\ntalked to him beforehand\nthrough the application and\n\n391\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.700\nit gave me that little security file so\nthat I can encrypt it and send it to him.\n\n392\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.570\nThe problem is too if it's ownership,\n\n393\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.490\nif it's something that I only I should\nsee, he wouldn't be able to read it.\n\n394\n00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.970\nSo again, those are some problems.\n\n395\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.780\nLike I said, I don't wanna get too\nmuch into security thing here but\n\n396\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.790\nthat could be file corruption\non that little security file\n\n397\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.380\nthat we talk about known as a certificate.\n\n398\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.490\nExtremely short battery life.\n\n399\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.035\nAll right, when it comes to extremely\nshort battery life it could be performance\n\n400\n00:20:48.035 --> 00:20:50.603\nsettings and this is the other\nside of the tracks, right?\n\n401\n00:20:50.603 --> 00:20:56.069\nThe fact that you end up having\na high performance set up, right?\n\n402\n00:20:56.069 --> 00:20:58.623\nYou got all of your wireless\nconnections turned on and\n\n403\n00:20:58.623 --> 00:21:01.385\nyou're just draining your battery life,\nright?\n\n404\n00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.985\nToo many applications are open.\n\n405\n00:21:02.985 --> 00:21:03.708\nYour battery is failing, right?\n\n406\n00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:06.195\nSome of the things that we've\nalready talked about with power.\n\n407\n00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:09.885\nCharger's failed, the cable's\ndamaged itself, the charging cable.\n\n408\n00:21:11.045 --> 00:21:14.720\nThe charging cable,\nagain, it's a data cable.\n\n409\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.060\nRight, it isn't a charging cable.\n\n410\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.030\nThat could be something AC Power source.\n\n411\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:24.030\nAll these things related to the batteries\nlack of the ability to charge,\n\n412\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.750\nor just low battery in general.\n\n413\n00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.570\nReconfigure your performance settings.\n\n414\n00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.900\nClose some applications,\ncheck the battery, run a diagnostic.\n\n415\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.740\nThey have applications that can\nrun battery health checks, right?\n\n416\n00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.790\nAnd you might need to replace the battery.\n\n417\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.810\nYou might need to replace the charger or\nthe cable associated with it.\n\n418\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.910\nCheck the AC source.\n\n419\n00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.960\nA lot of times, when you talk\nabout a rapidly depleting battery,\n\n420\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.800\nit could be a battery problem in itself,\nit could be a configuration setting or\n\n421\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.540\nit could just be that you are running\ntoo many things at one time.\n\n422\n00:21:56.862 --> 00:22:00.400\nOverheating, overheating is a big thing,\nremember proper thermal management\n\n423\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.660\nright that is something that\nwe also want to keep in mind.\n\n424\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.360\nRight, dust and\n\n425\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.810\ndebris gets in the vents a lot of times\nthese vents that we have aren't that big.\n\n426\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.520\nRight, do you have your phone?\n\n427\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.552\nIf it's a phone or a tablet I know this\nhas happened to me when I'm traveling and\n\n428\n00:22:14.552 --> 00:22:18.463\nI didn't realize that I had my tablet\nsitting in the passenger seat there and\n\n429\n00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:20.196\nthe sun's coming in the window.\n\n430\n00:22:20.196 --> 00:22:24.893\nAnd I will tell you that I've seen\niPads do this where they will literally\n\n431\n00:22:24.893 --> 00:22:28.820\ngo into a thermal shut down and\nthey will put a big triangle and\n\n432\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.420\nexclamation point that says\nthermal shut down in progress.\n\n433\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.080\nI thought it was amazing cuz I\nwas travelling for four hours.\n\n434\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.169\nAnd again, I had it in the passenger seat\nand the sun was coming in the whole entire\n\n435\n00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:41.140\ntime and\nit was cooking the mobile device, right?\n\n436\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my phone actually\ndid the exact same thing.\n\n437\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.081\nWe went to Disney and I left in\nthe car and it was like 97 degrees.\n\n438\n00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:48.482\n&gt;&gt; And it's scary, right?\n\n439\n00:22:48.482 --> 00:22:50.972\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I look at the phone, it was like,\n\n440\n00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:54.240\nyou have a thermal problem and\nthis device is being shutdown.\n\n441\n00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n442\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:55.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do that.\n\n443\n00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's scared the hack out\nof me cause I used it at a time for\n\n444\n00:22:58.528 --> 00:22:59.362\na tom tom, right?\n\n445\n00:22:59.362 --> 00:23:00.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n446\n00:23:00.135 --> 00:23:02.393\nI was like I better do something or\nI'm not gonna know where I'm at.\n\n447\n00:23:02.393 --> 00:23:06.078\n[LAUGH] So yeah, so keep in mind\nit could be direct sunlight and\n\n448\n00:23:06.078 --> 00:23:09.210\nwe could say environmental\nissues right now.\n\n449\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.270\nLike I said global warming or anything\nit's just a fact that whatever environment\n\n450\n00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:17.835\nyou have it in is basically\ncausing it to overheat.\n\n451\n00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:20.939\nAgain, many applications open,\nthis happens.\n\n452\n00:23:20.939 --> 00:23:23.768\nThe other thing, too I've seen\npeople where they turn over, and\n\n453\n00:23:23.768 --> 00:23:26.392\nthey don't realize that they\nmay be sitting on their phone,\n\n454\n00:23:26.392 --> 00:23:28.660\nand your body heat is\nactually causing that thing.\n\n455\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.578\nThink to not be able to dissipate heat and\nyour body heat.\n\n456\n00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:35.150\nSo just kinda pay attention\nto that problem there.\n\n457\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.485\nSome of these devices and\n\n458\n00:23:36.485 --> 00:23:40.880\na lot of these devices use passive heating\nwhich means they don't have many fans.\n\n459\n00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.710\nAll right, so they have thought about\nit enough to where they place maybe\n\n460\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.224\na heat sinks or strategically placing\nthe components within them so\n\n461\n00:23:50.224 --> 00:23:54.736\nthat they can cool themselves but\nany kind of debris gets in there and\n\n462\n00:23:54.736 --> 00:23:57.691\nit can cripple that\ntype of cooling system.\n\n463\n00:23:57.691 --> 00:24:01.956\nIf it happens to be active cooling\nwhich is using some sort of fan and\n\n464\n00:24:01.956 --> 00:24:05.232\nvent Make sure that the fans\nare still working, and\n\n465\n00:24:05.232 --> 00:24:08.754\nmake sure the vents are free\nof any debris or blockage.\n\n466\n00:24:08.754 --> 00:24:10.004\nFrozen system.\n\n467\n00:24:10.004 --> 00:24:13.855\nAll right, when it comes to a frozen\nsystem, it could be memory issues,\n\n468\n00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:16.150\ncould be an application hang, all right?\n\n469\n00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.250\nThis one could be malware as well.\n\n470\n00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.488\nSome of the things that you can do,\n\n471\n00:24:19.488 --> 00:24:21.940\nis force kill any application that\nmight be locking your system up.\n\n472\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.740\nIf that doesn't work,\nthen what you do, is you do a reboot.\n\n473\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.009\nAnd there's two type of reboots\nthat I want you to be aware of.\n\n474\n00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:29.970\nThere's a hard reboot, and\na soft reboot, all right?\n\n475\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.570\nA soft reboot, is where you press\nthe power button, you hold it in.\n\n476\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.040\nAnd it gives you a screen that says,\n\n477\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.570\ndo you wanna reboot, restart the device,\nor do you wanna shut it down?\n\n478\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.150\nThat's a soft reboot.\n\n479\n00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.000\nSometimes the system gets so frozen,\nthat that screen doesn't come up.\n\n480\n00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.190\nAnd typically what you do is you press,\nfor instance, the Home button, or\n\n481\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.920\nthe power button, and\na volume knob, right?\n\n482\n00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.390\nAnd you hold it in, and\n\n483\n00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.250\nit will literally be no different\nthan you taking a workstation and\n\n484\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.640\npressing in the power button, and holding\nit until it does a hard reboot, right?\n\n485\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.380\nSo soft reboot verses a hard reboot.\n\n486\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.953\nYou might have to do one or the other.\n\n487\n00:25:00.953 --> 00:25:06.729\nSome of the other things they talk about,\nno sound from the speakers, all right?\n\n488\n00:25:06.729 --> 00:25:09.150\nIt's gonna sound,\nI'm not talking down to anybody.\n\n489\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.530\nYou guys are smart out there,\nyou guys can do this.\n\n490\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.960\nAre the sound settings misconfigured?\n\n491\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.900\nDo you have a mute button turned on,\nright?\n\n492\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.390\nDo you have it on vibrate mode,\nrather than your volume turned up?\n\n493\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.078\nIt can happen very easy, right?\n\n494\n00:25:22.078 --> 00:25:24.992\nI know on my phone, and some of\nthe android phones, if you press the down\n\n495\n00:25:24.992 --> 00:25:30.130\nvolume button long enough,\nit instantly mutes the phone, right?\n\n496\n00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.055\nSo it could be a setting like that.\n\n497\n00:25:32.055 --> 00:25:34.680\nIt could be the fact that\nthe speakers have failed.\n\n498\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.030\nIt also could be an application setting,\nif it happens to be an application that is\n\n499\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.190\nspecific to some kinda sound\nhappening as well, right?\n\n500\n00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.440\nYou could get some conflict, or\n\n501\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.150\nmaybe you got one application that is\nusing your sound, but it's frozen.\n\n502\n00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.240\nAnd you're launching another application,\nand it can't take back over.\n\n503\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.742\nSo you can also reboot\nthe device there as well.\n\n504\n00:25:53.742 --> 00:25:58.340\nGPS not functioning, well,\nthis could be a couple of things, right?\n\n505\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.550\nLocation settings could be turned off,\nright?\n\n506\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.389\nIf you have location settings turned off,\nthen essentially you are disabling the GPS\n\n507\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.210\nreceiver, if you will, in your system.\n\n508\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.019\nIt could be the fact that you're in\nan area that isn't triangulated very well.\n\n509\n00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:18.600\nThat's kind of unlikely.\n\n510\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.220\nDoesn't say that it won't happen, but\n\n511\n00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.850\nwe have 27 satellites total that\nare surrounding the Earth right now.\n\n512\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.260\n24 of them are in operation 24/7,\n\n513\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.950\nwith 3 of them on standby in case they\nneed to repair or service one of them.\n\n514\n00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.840\nSo the chances of that happening,\nyou never say never, but\n\n515\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.320\nare really highly unlikely.\n\n516\n00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.890\nSo check location services.\n\n517\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.530\nIf you have that turned off for\nany kind of security reason,\n\n518\n00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.830\nthat might be the reason your GPS\nisn't tracking where you are.\n\n519\n00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.180\nThe other thing too,\nis you have, what is it?\n\n520\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.730\nThe gyroscopes,\nthe accelerometers and stuff.\n\n521\n00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.070\nAnd I've seen where they\ngive inaccurate information.\n\n522\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.397\nAnd mine has to do this crazy thing,\nwhere you sit there and\n\n523\n00:26:55.397 --> 00:26:57.307\ndo figure eights until\nit can kinda figure out.\n\n524\n00:26:57.307 --> 00:27:00.318\nAnd I always think that somebody's looking\nat me sitting here doing this with\n\n525\n00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:02.160\nmy phone wondering,\nwhat the heck is going?\n\n526\n00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.582\nBut it's the way it calibrates it, so.\n\n527\n00:27:03.582 --> 00:27:05.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Long night at the club, Wes?\n\n528\n00:27:05.114 --> 00:27:06.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n529\n00:27:06.183 --> 00:27:07.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n530\n00:27:07.063 --> 00:27:08.271\nyou might have to calibrate them as well.\n\n531\n00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:13.690\nSo when it says not functioning, it could\nbe not functioning properly as well.\n\n532\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.330\nAnd even though they don't call that out.\n\n533\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.740\nWe already mentioned swollen battery here,\nguys and gals out there.\n\n534\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.420\nSwollen battery basically means it's\ntime to get rid of that battery.\n\n535\n00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.852\nThat battery is two steps from blowing up.\n\n536\n00:27:26.852 --> 00:27:30.872\nAnd I don't wanna mention anybody here,\nany companies out here, but\n\n537\n00:27:30.872 --> 00:27:34.360\nwe've definitely seen some\nproblems in the past recently.\n\n538\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.250\nWith some batteries that have\ncaused some significant problems.\n\n539\n00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.530\nIf the battery in any way is swollen.\n\n540\n00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:44.220\nIf you see the device that is bigger\nthan what it should be in form factor,\n\n541\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.160\nyou need to first of all\nkeep it off of your body.\n\n542\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.260\nKeep it in some kind of protected case.\n\n543\n00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.280\nHonestly, I would not keep it in your car,\nand\n\n544\n00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.542\nI would take it to a field\ntechnician right away.\n\n545\n00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:59.830\nAnd send it back to the manufacturer,\nwhatever you have to do.\n\n546\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.450\nIf it's a carrier, and you're on CDMA,\ntake it to the carrier.\n\n547\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.160\nThey're gonna have to replace it,\nrefix it, or some sort.\n\n548\n00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.350\nIf it happens to be a SIM,\na GSM based phone or\n\n549\n00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.720\ndevice, remember,\nyou can pop the SIM card out.\n\n550\n00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.930\nYou can always replace it.\n\n551\n00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.340\nThat's a field serviceable item.\n\n552\n00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.040\nIf it is something that you can open\nup and you can replace the battery,\n\n553\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.530\ngo to your electronics store and\nget a battery replacement.\n\n554\n00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:24.750\nThat isn't something you wanna wait on,\ncuz it could be a bad day at the office.\n\n555\n00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.410\nAnd it could be something that\ncauses some kind of bodily harm.\n\n556\n00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.428\nAnd we certainly don't\nwant that here at ITProTV.\n\n557\n00:28:29.428 --> 00:28:32.540\nWe don't want any device getting hurt,\nbut we certainly don't want you guys and\n\n558\n00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.000\ngals out there getting hurt, either.\n\n559\n00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.370\nNow, one of the last things\nwe have to talk, Dan,\n\n560\n00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.990\nI know we're running towards the end here.\n\n561\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.090\nIs disassembling process for\nproper reassembly.\n\n562\n00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.280\nMaybe some of you guys remember when we\ndisassembled the laptop that was here.\n\n563\n00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.730\nYou could see how we had strategically\nplaced all the screws in different piles,\n\n564\n00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.350\nand I had done other things\nthat you guys didn't see.\n\n565\n00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.340\nTaking my cell phone, and taking\npictures of every step of the process.\n\n566\n00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.608\nSo that you know where the screw\nlocations are, you're documenting, and\n\n567\n00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:04.430\nyou're labeling the cables.\n\n568\n00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.847\nAnd i like the pictures just for regulate.\n\n569\n00:29:06.847 --> 00:29:10.218\nI don't care if i documented it properly.\n\n570\n00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:12.180\nA pictures worth a thousand words.\n\n571\n00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good reference.\n\n572\n00:29:13.365 --> 00:29:15.501\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI always use that a minor reference point.\n\n573\n00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:19.230\nOrganize your parts like we've mentioned.\n\n574\n00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.920\nSchematics, we had one gentlemen out there\nin the chat room that's talking about\n\n575\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.660\nthe MacBooks.\n\n576\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.280\nAnd said, if you're gonna be taking\napart a MacBook, schematics, schematics,\n\n577\n00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.540\nschematics, right?\n\n578\n00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.828\nSo refer to the manufacturers resources.\n\n579\n00:29:31.828 --> 00:29:35.580\nAnd remember to use the appropriate tools,\nright?\n\n580\n00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.500\nAs much as Dan and I would say,\nhey, you know what?\n\n581\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.623\nThis is a tool [SOUND] for every job?\n\n582\n00:29:40.623 --> 00:29:43.060\nNot necessarily when you're\nworking on mobile devices.\n\n583\n00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.042\nKeep in mind, you have things like\niFixit kits, torque screw drivers, and\n\n584\n00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:46.753\nstuff like that.\n\n585\n00:29:46.753 --> 00:29:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Blow torches.\n\n586\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.433\n&gt;&gt; And blow torches, right.\n\n587\n00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:50.615\nAcetylene torches, and\nin the end a hammer.\n\n588\n00:29:50.615 --> 00:29:52.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we're just kidding guys,\n\n589\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:52.720\ngals out there.\n\n590\n00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.520\nMake sure that you're using\nthe appropriate tools.\n\n591\n00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.130\nThere's a lot of tool kits out there.\n\n592\n00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.670\nRemember electrostatic discharge as well.\n\n593\n00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.290\nWork on electrically\nresistant mats as well.\n\n594\n00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.400\nSo that you don't have to\nworry about damaging the parts\n\n595\n00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.805\nthat you're trying to replace.\n\n596\n00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:05.475\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n597\n00:30:05.475 --> 00:30:09.945\nWell, there's definitely a giant expanse\nbefore us when it comes to mobile devices.\n\n598\n00:30:09.945 --> 00:30:11.585\nThings that we need to know,\ncommon issues,\n\n599\n00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:13.685\nand what they might be being caused by.\n\n600\n00:30:13.685 --> 00:30:17.235\nAnd then how we can start\nto remedy that situation.\n\n601\n00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:19.525\nAnd, of course, proper procedure\nwhen we're taking things apart and\n\n602\n00:30:19.525 --> 00:30:20.415\nputting them back together.\n\n603\n00:30:20.415 --> 00:30:21.435\nYou wanna follow that,\n\n604\n00:30:21.435 --> 00:30:24.605\ncuz you don't wanna be [LAUGH] left\nwith a handful of screws and parts and\n\n605\n00:30:24.605 --> 00:30:28.105\ngo, here's your device, and here's\nthe extra bits I found inside of it.\n\n606\n00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:29.060\nYou're gonna love that, all right?\n\n607\n00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.220\n[LAUGH] So you're gonna get some weird\nlooks from your customers if you do that.\n\n608\n00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.730\nBut Wes, we thank you for\nwalking us through this, and\n\n609\n00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.190\nwe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n610\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.540\nBut it looks like it is that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n611\n00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.010\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n613\n00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:43.820\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n614\n00:30:43.820 -->

greetings everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.031\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:17.750\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.820\nAnd in today's episode,\nit's all about, well more A+.\n\n10\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.220\nThat's right, we're killing it.\n\n11\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.150\nTrying to get through all that content for\nyou guys so\n\n12\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.070\nthat you can go pass that exam.\n\n13\n00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830\nIf you're keeping score,\nthat's the 22901 for\n\n14\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.900\nthose of you in the know,\nyou know what I'm talking about.\n\n15\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.640\nJoining us back in the studio,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n16\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.090\nWes, we're glad to have you back.\n\n17\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.850\n&gt;&gt; How's it going today, sir?\n\n18\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n19\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.860\nWe've been troubleshooting our\nway through troubleshooting.\n\n20\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.830\nThat's for sure.\n\n21\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n22\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.370\nAnd we're gonna be talking about\nthe bane of just about all IT existence.\n\n23\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.070\nIn this episode, that's going to\nbe about troubleshooting printer.\n\n24\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Dun dun dun.\n\n25\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.180\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I can think of a movie or\n\n26\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.110\ntwo where the baseball bat is\nthe maintenance tool that you use.\n\n27\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.760\nIt's effective.\n\n28\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.395\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n29\n00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:58.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Also,\n\n30\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.230\nkeep in mind printers are important,\nlike one of our other hosts says,\n\n31\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.570\nDon Pizets says the whole entire\nnetwork can fail, but if at\n\n32\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.680\nleast one printer is working, you can\n&gt;&gt; Can print your resume\n\n33\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.090\nout the front door?\n\n34\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.680\nSo keep in mind printers are important.\n\n35\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.790\nAnd all joking aside,\n\n36\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.480\nwe're gonna walk through just a real\nslew of problems that they can give you.\n\n37\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.550\nAnd we'll talk about some of\nthe common things you can check\n\n38\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.390\nto make sure that these\nthings can get fixed.\n\n39\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.780\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n40\n00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.890\nWe're gonna dive right in.\n\n41\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.130\nOne of the first things they\ntalk about are streaks.\n\n42\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.330\nWhen we talk about streaks and\n\n43\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.740\nyour printed output could\nbe a couple of things.\n\n44\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.270\nRight?\nOne of the things is that if it's a laser\n\n45\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.610\nprinter, could be the toner hopper.\n\n46\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.920\nCould be a toner hopper issue.\n\n47\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.970\nRemember that's where\nour toner's going to be.\n\n48\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.740\nRight?\nIt could be low toner for that matter.\n\n49\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.360\nAs toner starts to fade,\nyou also get faded images as well.\n\n50\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.390\nCould be low toner or\nlow ink if it's an inkjet type printer.\n\n51\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.800\nIt could be things like, for instance,\ndamaged print head assemblies.\n\n52\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.950\nThat is something that can\nalso cause streaks as well.\n\n53\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.690\nSome of the other things\nthat we have faded prints.\n\n54\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.820\nWe talk about faded prints.\n\n55\n00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.980\nWell, faded prints can be just\nthe fact that whatever the-\n\n56\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.920\nnot the print media itself- but\n\n57\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.870\nwhatever the Compound is the component\nis that it actually hits the media.\n\n58\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.290\nIt could be low.\n\n59\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.720\nSo some of these you're going to see\nthat they could manifest themselves in\n\n60\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.520\ndifferent types of media output\nas far as the fact that hey,\n\n61\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.230\nwell, if we've got streaks,\ncould be running out of toner.\n\n62\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.460\nWe had a faded image?\n\n63\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.030\nWell, guess what?\n\n64\n00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.110\nIt could be running out of toner.\n\n65\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.580\nIt could be the fact, if you had a faded\nprint, that it's an impact printer.\n\n66\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.430\nDon't discount the fact that impact\nprinters are still used especially\n\n67\n00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.030\nbecause they are perfect for multicopy\nprinting, like carbon copies and stuff.\n\n68\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.960\nThey're heavily used.\n\n69\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.730\nYou've probably seen them in last\ntime you went to a mechanics shop and\n\n70\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.180\nthey maybe changed your oil and\nthey printed out the bill.\n\n71\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.510\nYou'll see a lot of times they tear\nit right out, and you sign, and\n\n72\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.420\nthey keep their copy and\nyou keep your copy.\n\n73\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.380\nSo it could be that fact that\nyou have something like a ribbon\n\n74\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.942\nreplacement that needs to happen.\n\n75\n00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:07.300\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ndive into another one.\n\n76\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.950\nAnother one they talk about is\nthe toner not fused to the paper.\n\n77\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.730\nI have a little diagram here that we\nused inside of our print process.\n\n78\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.280\nWhen we are talking about\nour print process and\n\n79\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.240\nprinters in general, just looking at\nthe different print technologies.\n\n80\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.770\nLet's go ahead and\nrecap that laser print process,\n\n81\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.280\nI wrote it out in a couple\nof different ways.\n\n82\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.070\nRemember processing, cleaning,\nconditioning, writing, developing,\n\n83\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.150\ntransferring, and fusing.\n\n84\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.750\nBoy, that sounds like\nMickey Mouse Club for sure.\n\n85\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.080\nBut remember the last phase\nof the fusing process.\n\n86\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.870\nAnd if you remember, if not go back and\ncheck out our printing technologies\n\n87\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.890\nepisode, but remember that in the fusing\nprocess, what happens is as the toner,\n\n88\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.780\nright, as the toner this EP Drum, alright.\n\n89\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.056\nI tell you what we'll kind\nof brief through it here so\n\n90\n00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:57.266\nwe can know what the trouble\nis that's happening.\n\n91\n00:03:57.266 --> 00:04:02.954\nRemember that the laser basically hits the\nscanning assembly if you will the scanning\n\n92\n00:04:02.954 --> 00:04:08.018\nmirror and that basically points\nthe laser down on the electrostatic drum.\n\n93\n00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:12.388\nIt's called an EP drum electrostatic\nphotographic drum I've heard Remember\n\n94\n00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:15.720\nit responds to electricity and\nlight as well.\n\n95\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.090\nNow, the laser is responsible for\n\n96\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.980\nreducing the electrical charge\nthat is put on the drum assembly.\n\n97\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.030\nWell, here's the problem.\n\n98\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.370\nHere's what can happen.\n\n99\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.480\nAs the paper and\nas the drum rotates right,\n\n100\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.590\nwe have this loose transfer of the toner.\n\n101\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.160\nThat's in the developing phase.\n\n102\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.030\nThe developing phase is when the toner is\nactually adhered to the paper because of\n\n103\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.560\nthe strong positive charge\nthat's put on the paper.\n\n104\n00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.890\nNow here's the thing, the last part of\nthe laser print process is as the paper\n\n105\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.260\ntravels through the fusing assembly,\nit uses friction and heat, right?\n\n106\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.150\nOr pressure, excuse me, and heat.\n\n107\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.310\nAnd kind of it you're rolling out dough,\nwe press the dough out and\n\n108\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.150\nit flattens it out.\n\n109\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.600\nWell, this is usually the combination\nof that pressure and heat and\n\n110\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.940\nthe heat what it does is it melts the\nplastics that are in the toner adhering it\n\n111\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.270\nto the paper right.\n\n112\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.620\nThat's the fusing process.\n\n113\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.270\nNow, when this fails to happen,\n\n114\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.360\nthere's a couple of things\nthat could be going on here.\n\n115\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.206\nAll right one is the fact\nthat the fusing assembly.\n\n116\n00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:19.218\nIt's failed.\n\n117\n00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:20.757\nAll right, it isn't heating up.\n\n118\n00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:24.060\nAnd because of that, right?\n\n119\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.660\nWhat's gonna happen is as that\npaper comes out in the output tray,\n\n120\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.410\nyou can take the toner and you can\nkind of smear it a little bit right?\n\n121\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.210\nBecause we're not having the heat at all.\n\n122\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.900\nIt's not melting it and\nadhering the plastics to the paper.\n\n123\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.140\nThe other thing that can kinda\nhappen too with this, and\n\n124\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.160\nI'll probably mess up my slide\nhere a little bit is when the,\n\n125\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.960\nbasically what happens is\nthe fusing rollers get overheated.\n\n126\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.950\nIt happens to warp them.\n\n127\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.020\nAll right.\nSo as they turn,\n\n128\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.030\nthey're not turning in a perfect\ncircle anymore, if you will.\n\n129\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.150\nThey're turning in more in\nmore like an egg shape and\n\n130\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.550\na portion as it turns doesn't\neven hit the paper at all.\n\n131\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.090\nAll right.\n\n132\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.610\nAnd that also will cause\nthe toner to not properly adhere,\n\n133\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.690\nif you will, to the paper as well.\n\n134\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.220\nThe other thing that can happen too,\nall right.\n\n135\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.195\nInside of the laser printer here,\n\n136\n00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:17.925\none of the things that it has is\nthe thermal temperature sensor.\n\n137\n00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:19.425\nIt also has a fuse.\n\n138\n00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:22.945\nNow, keep in mind that\nthese fusing assemblies,\n\n139\n00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:26.485\nin the fusing process,\nthey can heat up enough to cook a turkey.\n\n140\n00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:31.535\nI think it's right around 350 to\n375 degrees, so it's very hot.\n\n141\n00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:34.940\nIf the thermal temperature sensor finds\n\n142\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.960\nout that that high voltage power source\nisn't regulating the heat appropriately.\n\n143\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.550\nIt'll only let till the heat\nrise to a certain level\n\n144\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.180\nwhere the fuse will pop, right?\n\n145\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.480\nAnd if it's an industrial-based\ntype printing assembly,\n\n146\n00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.090\nyou're gonna hear it pop, right?\n\n147\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.610\nIt's a very loud sound if you're\nin a printing factory, right?\n\n148\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.130\nWell, when that happens, right?\n\n149\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.430\nYou're not gonna get here coming\nout of the machine neither.\n\n150\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.090\nSo do keep that in mind,\ncouple of things that might happen.\n\n151\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.568\nAll right, how about creased paper?\n\n152\n00:07:02.568 --> 00:07:05.720\nWell, creased paper can happen for\na couple of reasons, right?\n\n153\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.150\nIt could be the feed mechanism so\nfor instance,\n\n154\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.350\nlet's say here,\nwe've got a thermal printer, right?\n\n155\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.290\nJust kind of a basic diagram\nof a thermal printer.\n\n156\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.560\nWell, if the feed assembly Is misaligned.\n\n157\n00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.570\nThis could be inkjet printers right?\n\n158\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.550\nThis could be thermal printers that\nyou got receipt paper going into.\n\n159\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.740\nIf the feed assembly is off a little bit\nor damaged, it might crease the paper.\n\n160\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.620\nThis can happen too if Wes is\nloading the paper tray as well and\n\n161\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.330\nyou load the paper in to the tray wrong.\n\n162\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.140\nIt ends up pulling it through and\nit creases a little bit.\n\n163\n00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.708\nThat can happen.\n\n164\n00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.830\nI tell you, not often but\n\n165\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.530\nI have seen it too where the paper\ninside of the cut, right?\n\n166\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.550\nAs you pull, right?\n\n167\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.490\nI don't what they call,\nthey call them something.\n\n168\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.650\nI just call them blocks of paper.\n\n169\n00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.370\nBut they actually have a name.\n\n170\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.417\nBut anyways, where that comes\nfrom the manufacturer that way.\n\n171\n00:07:53.417 --> 00:07:57.260\nThat's not quite as common, right, that\nthe manufacturer would cause the problem.\n\n172\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.989\nA lot of times what\nhappens is you know it.\n\n173\n00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:03.967\nWill happen, because either the fit\nassembly might be misaligned it's not\n\n174\n00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:07.883\nproperly pull the paper through, or\nthe fact that you might have to bring in\n\n175\n00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:11.675\nthere, and what happens is that fit\nassembly is slowly using friction,\n\n176\n00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:14.870\nif you'll friction fit\nassembly is pulling that in.\n\n177\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.010\nIt kind of creases the paper, and then,\nthe other thing is that the paper isn't\n\n178\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.430\naligned in the tray appropriately-\n&gt;&gt; Wes,\n\n179\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.040\nI used to work on this one printer, and it\nthought that its job was not printing, but\n\n180\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.000\nmaking little paper fans.\n\n181\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.604\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go-\n&gt;&gt; Every time, I kid you not,\n\n182\n00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:31.410\nyou could probably, perfect paper fans,\nthey would it crank creases up so hard.\n\n183\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.792\n&gt;&gt; A printer that doubles as a printer,\nand\n\n184\n00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:34.514\nautomatically called gummy\nmachine [CROSSTALK].\n\n185\n00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know so, for sure [LAUGH].\n\n186\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.662\nIt's like stupid machine [LAUGH], and\n\n187\n00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:39.910\nthen, they don't want to\nknow what is happening.\n\n188\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.238\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You know\nwhat is interesting.\n\n189\n00:08:41.238 --> 00:08:44.941\nYou always hear a couple of stories and\nanybody that's working in IT,\n\n190\n00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.110\nthat's come across pure problems.\n\n191\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.010\nThat is one of the reasons [LAUGH] that\nnot only we're having this episode, but\n\n192\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.590\nthe fact that it is so\ncommon in the objectives.\n\n193\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.750\nAll right, so how about paper not feeding?\n\n194\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.360\nHow about this?, an empty media tray.\n\n195\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.826\n[LAUGH] If you don't\nhave paper in the tray,\n\n196\n00:09:01.826 --> 00:09:03.300\nit's not going to feed properly, right?\n\n197\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.090\nWrong type of media and\nhere's what I mean by that, right?\n\n198\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.700\nA lot of times your trays, your feed\nassemblies have multimedia types, right?\n\n199\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.000\nAnd what I mean, is by multimedia types is\nI'm not saying, you're gonna plug your MP3\n\n200\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.130\nplayer into tray, and\nyou're gonna have that print something.\n\n201\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.210\nBut what I mean, is that they support\nmultiple media type formats, right?\n\n202\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.230\nAnd if you don't have\nthe positioners aligned right,\n\n203\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.750\nthat could cause problems and\nnot allow it to feed through.\n\n204\n00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.040\nIf you happen to have\nthe wrong paper to begin with,\n\n205\n00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.910\nit may cause it not to feed properly.\n\n206\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.760\nAgain, this could be the paper feed\nassembly has failed, you know,\n\n207\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.130\nit's not uncommon that you have the whole\nassembly in general ends up failing.\n\n208\n00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.320\nKeep in mind that there\nare step remoters in there.\n\n209\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.540\nAnd a lot of times there are belts, and if\na belts break, or the stepper motor fail,\n\n210\n00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.610\nthe gears get ground down.\n\n211\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.360\nHow can that happen?\n\n212\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.930\nHow can the gears get ground down?\n\n213\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.030\nHow can you grind?\n\n214\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.450\nThey're plastic gears.\n\n215\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.470\nAnd the commonality is what\nhappens when there's a paper jam?\n\n216\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.440\nYou know, you reach on,\nand what do you do?\n\n217\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.240\nYou pull a paper right down, right?\n\n218\n00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.180\nWell, in a lot of the in a machine that\nyou see the printing machines that you'll\n\n219\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.150\nsee, they have specific like steps that\nyou take, and you unmatch these device and\n\n220\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.080\nit releases a mechanism, when you unmatch\nthis device and it releases a mechanism,\n\n221\n00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.550\nmay do that, so that you don't\nstrip gears within it, all right.\n\n222\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.930\nBasic home printers sometimes\ndon't have that ability.\n\n223\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.860\nYou really have to just reach over, and\nyou have to kind of just pull the paper\n\n224\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.400\nout, but keep in mind that that\ncould strip the gears, right?\n\n225\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.906\nThere's a lot of times they're just\nplastic little, you know teeth on them.\n\n226\n00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:43.715\nAnd if they get stripped out that could\nalso cause the paper not to feed.\n\n227\n00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.745\nEnvironmental issues, all right.\n\n228\n00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:50.025\nWhen we talk about environment issues\nwe're not talking about global warming, or\n\n229\n00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:50.725\nclimate change.\n\n230\n00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:53.475\nWhat we're talking about is,\nif you have for\n\n231\n00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:59.035\ninstance a printer that is in\na very humid location, right.\n\n232\n00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:03.900\nPaper gets moisture in it and, again,\nthat can cause problems, right?\n\n233\n00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.510\nPaper jam, this can happen just,\nagain, wrong media type.\n\n234\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.140\nCould be not loading\nthe paper up correctly.\n\n235\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.820\nDebris could again be inside of\nthe feed mechanism as well, and\n\n236\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.340\nthat could be causing a jam.\n\n237\n00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.960\nAs those rollers spin they lock up, and\n\n238\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.160\nthey don't allow the paper\nto come through.\n\n239\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.610\nAll right, a paper jam could also be the\nfact that maybe the feed assembly tried to\n\n240\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.700\ngrab more than one piece of paper, and\npull it through the machine likewise.\n\n241\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.230\nAll right.\n\n242\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.670\nNext thing we got.\n\n243\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.740\nNow, this one is something that\nhas a lot of different potential\n\n244\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.730\nissues that could cause the problem,\nright?\n\n245\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.040\nNo connectivity.\n\n246\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.950\nI can't connect to the printer, all right?\n\n247\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.850\nWell, I want you to think of just\nbasic network communications.\n\n248\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.540\nCould be a network adapter issue.\n\n249\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.980\nWe say network issue, now,\nyou have to find out,\n\n250\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.470\nif you have no connectivity\nto the printer,\n\n251\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.590\nis it gonna be on the device that you're\ntrying to send the print job from?\n\n252\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.100\nYou could just have no connection.\n\n253\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.260\nIf I turn off the wireless\nadapter in my computer,\n\n254\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.040\nI can't understand why I can't\nsend our print job to the printer.\n\n255\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.670\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like what you're saying,\nis when it comes to whether, or\n\n256\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.345\nnot you have connectivity to the device.\n\n257\n00:12:09.345 --> 00:12:13.005\nReally our connectivity troubleshooting\nmodel is really where we're going to go.\n\n258\n00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:15.685\nIt's no different than any other\ndevice we might be connecting to.\n\n259\n00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:16.725\n&gt;&gt; No, different that what you and\n\n260\n00:12:16.725 --> 00:12:19.315\nI did in the network\ntroubleshooting sections, right?\n\n261\n00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:21.537\nAbsolutely the case.\n\n262\n00:12:21.537 --> 00:12:23.117\nNetwork configuration, right?\n\n263\n00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.697\nSo, again, like Dan said,\n\n264\n00:12:24.697 --> 00:12:27.267\nthese are a recap of some of the things\nthat we've already taken care of.\n\n265\n00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:28.887\nAnd that's why I'm kinda\nbriefing over them, right?\n\n266\n00:12:28.887 --> 00:12:31.327\nWe're not gonna go into TCP/IP\nsettings and what that means.\n\n267\n00:12:31.327 --> 00:12:33.777\nGo check our networking episodes out,\nright?\n\n268\n00:12:33.777 --> 00:12:35.697\nBut you do have to keep them in mind,\nright?\n\n269\n00:12:35.697 --> 00:12:37.167\nAnd here's the other thing\nthat can happen, too.\n\n270\n00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:38.317\nWhen you have no connectivity,\n\n271\n00:12:38.317 --> 00:12:41.000\nit might be the fact that you\nhaven't shared the printer route.\n\n272\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.710\nAll right,\nthat's one thing that can happen.\n\n273\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.630\n&gt;&gt; It'd be hard to grab a hold of that\nprinter if it's not shared out [LAUGH].\n\n274\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nit causes problems, right?\n\n275\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.070\nThe other thing could\nbe a permission issue.\n\n276\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.030\nCould be a lack of\nan installed printer as well.\n\n277\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.120\nIf it's a local printer that you're\nsharing out to other people.\n\n278\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.680\nMaybe people don't have the permission\nto print to it, or maybe they're not\n\n279\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.299\nan administrator, because, remember,\nyou need to install print drivers.\n\n280\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.740\nSo, even if I do connect\nbasically to a printer.\n\n281\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.310\nIf I don't have the administrative\nprivileges in order to install all\n\n282\n00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.720\nthe drivers,\nI'm not gonna be able to connect to it.\n\n283\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.400\nCould be general power issues.\n\n284\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.810\nNever overlook the simple fixes first,\nright?\n\n285\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.950\nWe talked about an Ethernet cable isn't\nplugged in that's part of the network\n\n286\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.550\ntroubleshooting, but\nhow about the power cable?\n\n287\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.580\nIs the power cable plugged in, right?\n\n288\n00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.240\nThe power cable's plugged in, well.\n\n289\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.320\nDo you lose power to the AC source, right?\n\n290\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.510\nAgain, another common issue\nthat could be the problem.\n\n291\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.782\nAnd I mentioned some other things, and\nagain, a lot of these like Dan just fall\n\n292\n00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:37.240\nunder the troubleshooting\nwireless configuration, right?\n\n293\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.450\nCheck the wireless AP,\n\n294\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.019\nthe access point, right?,\nif it happens to be a wireless network.\n\n295\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.910\nAll right, what are some of\nthe other ones that we have?\n\n296\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.960\nGarbled characters, right?\n\n297\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.170\nNow, there's a couple of things\nthat could be the problem here.\n\n298\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.030\nCould be the fact that it's\na compatibility issue, right?\n\n299\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.400\nA lot of your operating systems,\n\n300\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.860\nthey support really going back to legacy\nprinters, but there's never a guarantee.\n\n301\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.980\nThe other thing it could\nbe is a driver issue.\n\n302\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.000\nIf your characters aren't coming out the\nway you like, and they're garbled up like\n\n303\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.450\nthat, and you're getting some kind\nof these funky type characters, and\n\n304\n00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.150\nyou're like, that's not even English,\nor whatever language you speak,\n\n305\n00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.930\nyou're getting boxes and\nspecial characters, right?\n\n306\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.000\nA lot of times,\nthat can be a driver issue.\n\n307\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.730\nThe fact that you've\ngot a corrupted driver,\n\n308\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.610\nyou don't have the right driver,\nyou've got a missing driver,\n\n309\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.180\nyou're not going to be able\nto communicate to it at all.\n\n310\n00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.270\nSo, that could be the problem too.\n\n311\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.390\nThe other thing is keep in\nmind all of your printers,\n\n312\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.480\nthey receive binary information,\nthe electrical input,\n\n313\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.520\nbinary information into something\ncalled a formatter board.\n\n314\n00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.680\nThe formatter board is just a logic\ncircuit if you will the logical circuit\n\n315\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.370\nboard the PCP that receives the\ncommunication, whether it's from a network\n\n316\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.220\nadapter sending information from\nthe network adapter into the printer, or\n\n317\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.430\nwhether it is a local printer\nthat is connected directly via\n\n318\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.500\nsome kind of physical\ncable to your computer.\n\n319\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.740\nThat formatter board, if I could say that\nright, if I can format the question,\n\n320\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.060\nright?, what it does is\nit receives instructions.\n\n321\n00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.950\nSo, let's follow the chain\nof command here.\n\n322\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.820\nOperating system communicates\nwith the driver.\n\n323\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.390\nThe driver tells the formatter board\nthis is what I want you to print.\n\n324\n00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.760\nThe formatter board instructs the printer.\n\n325\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.060\nOn how to basically print the output.\n\n326\n00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.690\nAny one of those chains breaks down we got\na break down in communication, guess what?\n\n327\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.040\nWe might have output problems.\n\n328\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.700\nCould be configuration issues too.\n\n329\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.860\nThat could be something.\n\n330\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.563\nAll right, what are some of the other\nthings that they call out here, Dan.\n\n331\n00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:30.809\nThey call out vertical\nlines on the page itself,\n\n332\n00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:33.990\nnow this could be a couple of things.\n\n333\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.160\nVertical lines,\nwe're not talking about horizontal lines.\n\n334\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.040\nHorizontal lines a lot of times can be\nthe fact that you've got low toner.\n\n335\n00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.690\nYou've got an ink cartridge that\nis running out, or it's dried up.\n\n336\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.013\nYou get vertical lines there, for\ninstance let's say, a laser printer.\n\n337\n00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:51.511\nIf there is damage to the EP drum,\nthat centralized drum that everything\n\n338\n00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:56.830\nbasically, the whole print process\nrotates around, quite literally.\n\n339\n00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.640\nIf you get damage to the EP drum.\n\n340\n00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.354\nRight?\n\n341\n00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:02.910\nI want you to think about this, if\nyou've ever seen one of those industrial\n\n342\n00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.080\nprinters, right, well, what do you find\nnext to the printers a lot of times?\n\n343\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.140\nI find a staple remover,\nand I find a stapler.\n\n344\n00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.250\nWell, guess what?\n\n345\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.525\nIf I remove a staple and\nit gets down in any way,\n\n346\n00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:17.335\ndown into that machine,\nit's not gonna just come out, right?\n\n347\n00:16:17.335 --> 00:16:20.205\nUnless you have a technician, and\nyou turn it upside down, right?\n\n348\n00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:23.405\nBut the point is, joking aside,\nis that debris could get down in there.\n\n349\n00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:25.805\nAnd if it does,\nit can cause a problem, all right?\n\n350\n00:16:25.805 --> 00:16:29.675\nSo vertical lines could be the fact that\nyou have an electrostatic photographic\n\n351\n00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:32.197\ndrum, an EP drum could be damaged.\n\n352\n00:16:32.197 --> 00:16:35.620\nAll right, so\nwhat are some of the other things?\n\n353\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.020\nI know it's a laundry list, ladies and\ngentlemen, but keep in mind,\n\n354\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.478\nwe're not kidding when we say printers\nare the bane of your existence.\n\n355\n00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:42.897\nAnd you will need to know\nsome of these for the exam,\n\n356\n00:16:42.897 --> 00:16:45.470\nespecially if they put you\nin the scenarios, right?\n\n357\n00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.471\nBacked up print queue, all right, now-\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you're taking good backups of\n\n358\n00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:49.103\nyour print queue.\n\n359\n00:16:49.103 --> 00:16:50.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n360\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.171\nWell, and I'll tell you what, that does\nbeg the question, print queue, all right,\n\n361\n00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:56.385\nwell, what is that?\n\n362\n00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:59.615\nWell, the print queue, I want you to\nunderstand, is a print job is when I have\n\n363\n00:16:59.615 --> 00:17:02.230\nto print something,\nit's called a print job, all right?\n\n364\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:08.040\nNow you have a printer, if you will,\ndriver, Microsoft is very,\n\n365\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.580\nvery confusing on what they talk\nabout when they mention a printer.\n\n366\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.410\nThe printer is actually the software\ninside of the operating system.\n\n367\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.580\nAnd the output that you see comes\nfrom what's called, technically,\n\n368\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.375\na print device.\n\n369\n00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:21.920\nWhen we talk about a print queue,\nall right,\n\n370\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.750\na print queue is where those\nprint jobs get stacked up, right?\n\n371\n00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.840\nA queue is waiting in line.\n\n372\n00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.700\nIf I have a backed up print queue,\nthis actually has happened kind of\n\n373\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.910\nrecently on one of the printers that\nwe have where the hosts print to.\n\n374\n00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.710\nIs the fact that it's not printing,\nall right?\n\n375\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.020\nWhat happens is the job is rendered,\n\n376\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.965\nand a couple of things things can happen,\nright, depending on performance,\n\n377\n00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:47.463\ndo you want backed up print queue, and\nthat´s what made me think of it, right?\n\n378\n00:17:47.463 --> 00:17:51.065\nThe print queue actually gets written\nto the hard drive first, right, or\n\n379\n00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:53.300\nthe print job gets written\nto the hard drive.\n\n380\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.540\nThat's called spooling the print job.\n\n381\n00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.595\nAnd then it gets sent to the queue,\nwhether it's a local printer or\n\n382\n00:17:58.595 --> 00:18:02.240\nacross the network, and\nthen the print queue holds it, all right?\n\n383\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.040\nAnd if you're first come, first serve,\nright, as the job gets printed out,\n\n384\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.480\nit just basically eliminates\nthe print queue, right?\n\n385\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.770\nIt eliminates it out of the print queue.\n\n386\n00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.150\nIf it keeps backing up, then it could be\nthe fact that your printer isn't printing,\n\n387\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.100\nright, or it's not connecting.\n\n388\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.011\nYou're sending print jobs and what they're\ndoing is they're being spooled to your\n\n389\n00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:21.073\nlocal hard drive, and\nthey're in your local print queue.\n\n390\n00:18:21.073 --> 00:18:24.822\nBut they're never being sent across the\nnetwork to the actual printer that's gonna\n\n391\n00:18:24.822 --> 00:18:26.580\nprint them out, right?\n\n392\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.540\nSo that could be a problem.\n\n393\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:34.230\nExam alert, if you see print jobs in the\nprint queue, I can tell you what it isn't.\n\n394\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.380\nWhat it is not is a permissions issue.\n\n395\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.060\nYou have to have a print\npermission to even be able to send\n\n396\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.155\nthe print job to the print queue.\n\n397\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.376\nThat begs the question, what happens if\nthe print jobs don't make it to the queue?\n\n398\n00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:50.670\nNow, I don't even know, I don't even\nthink they have this one on here,\n\n399\n00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.560\nDan, but I wanna go ahead and mention it.\n\n400\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.090\nWhat if your jobs don't go\nto the print queue at all?\n\n401\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:59.265\nYou don't have a printer installed,\nyou don't have the appropriate driver, or\n\n402\n00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:01.277\nyou don't have permissions, right?\n\n403\n00:19:01.277 --> 00:19:04.298\nEspecially in Windows, right, you have to\nhave print permission to even be able to\n\n404\n00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:06.210\nsend information to the print queue.\n\n405\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.990\nAnd that includes a print server out there\nthat is actually doing the printing on\n\n406\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.490\nyour behalf or\nmultiple network printers on their behalf.\n\n407\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.090\nAll right, backed up print queue,\n\n408\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.450\nhow about the printer's\njust completely turned off?\n\n409\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.940\nPower issues or\n\n410\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.640\nnot even turned on to begin with,\nthat can be a problem likewise.\n\n411\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.713\nAll right, the other thing that I\nwill say, and we've kinda seen this.\n\n412\n00:19:27.713 --> 00:19:32.404\nI'm thinking of that printer that we have\nnext to the host section here at ITProTV,\n\n413\n00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:35.218\nis that go over to your printer and\nlook at the OSD,\n\n414\n00:19:35.218 --> 00:19:39.070\nthe on screen display, right,\nand see if you see an error.\n\n415\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.160\nIf you see an error, like we've got\none that's happening periodically,\n\n416\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.280\nI think we've got maybe a print\nhead assembly that's failing,\n\n417\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.430\nthat says you need to recycle the printer,\nall right?\n\n418\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.530\nPower cycle the printer,\njust a fancy word for reboot.\n\n419\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.920\nAll right, we've got some kind of\ninternal issue that's going on,\n\n420\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.490\nit could be the fact that it's damaged,\nright?\n\n421\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.210\nSo that could happen too, all right?\n\n422\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.510\nLow memory errors, all right, what happens\nhere when we say low memory errors?\n\n423\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.170\nLow memory errors mean you got too\nmany things in the print queue, and\n\n424\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.380\nthe printer just cannot handle the volume,\nright, that could happen.\n\n425\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.290\nNow be careful with this one because\nsometimes it's field serviceable,\n\n426\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.800\nsometimes it isn't.\n\n427\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.160\nAnd what I mean by that is, you have some\nprinters that have the built in memory.\n\n428\n00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.923\nEspecially the one that\nhas a network printer and\n\n429\n00:20:20.923 --> 00:20:22.640\nalso has a print server built into it.\n\n430\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.840\nThey have to have a certain bit of memory,\nvoluble memory source that they\n\n431\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.260\ncan actually store the print jobs\nthat come over the network to it.\n\n432\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.840\nSometimes you can gain access to it,\nsometimes you can see,\n\n433\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.180\nyou can pull the side, a little cover,\nright off the printer,\n\n434\n00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.930\nkind of like a fuse box in your car.\n\n435\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.590\nJust pull the cover right off, and\nsure enough, you can see sold in memory.\n\n436\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.824\nSometimes you see the full dual\ninline memory modules, and\n\n437\n00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:44.511\nsometimes it's upgradable.\n\n438\n00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:45.970\nSometimes it isn't.\n\n439\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.580\nSometimes you don't have access to those.\n\n440\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.410\nAnd other times, you might be under a\nservicing contract, where you have a third\n\n441\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.310\nparty that actually comes in and performs\nall the maintenance to begin with.\n\n442\n00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.900\nSo that's something that we\ncan't overlook, warranties and\n\n443\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.409\nactually third party technicians\nthat actually oversee printers.\n\n444\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.730\nAll right, what else do we got?\n\n445\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.900\nAgain, I know,\n\n446\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.290\nit is a bunch of different things that\ncan go wrong with the printers, right?\n\n447\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.880\nSo the next thing they talk\nabout is access denied,\n\n448\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.470\ntwo things that I can think of.\n\n449\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.640\nFirst of all, permissions,\nlet's say, in Windows,\n\n450\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.220\nyou don't have the print permission?\n\n451\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.610\nGuess what, access is denied,\nit's an ACL, it's an access control list.\n\n452\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.489\nIt controls access to the device.\n\n453\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.250\nHere's the other thing.\n\n454\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.590\nAll right, I don't know about you, Dan,\nin some of the places that you've worked.\n\n455\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.900\nBut I know in some of the places that\nI've worked where the teachers and\n\n456\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.180\nthe instructors were working,\nI was one of the instructors.\n\n457\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.895\nWe actually had a time of day restriction\non it that said you're not gonna print\n\n458\n00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:42.620\nyour 800 page PDF for your instructor's\nmanual at a certain time, right?\n\n459\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.410\nYou had to wait till off hours, right?\n\n460\n00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:48.859\nThey don't want one of their people\nthat are actually doing consulting for\n\n461\n00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:51.188\na company to have to sit there and wait,\n\n462\n00:21:51.188 --> 00:21:54.312\nwhile your 800 page\ninstruction manual prints.\n\n463\n00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:57.785\nSo it could be a time of day restriction,\nwhere they actually have enforced that.\n\n464\n00:21:57.785 --> 00:21:59.884\nAnd they say okay,\nbetween this time and this time,\n\n465\n00:21:59.884 --> 00:22:01.561\nit's only gonna be marketing and sales.\n\n466\n00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:03.080\nIt's only gonna be account executives.\n\n467\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.111\nIt's only gonna be our\ncustomer relations management,\n\n468\n00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:10.740\nright, CRM people, right?\n\n469\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.130\nSo it could be a time of\nday restriction as well.\n\n470\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.520\nAll right, now this one's generic.\n\n471\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.370\nI like this one, Dan.\n\n472\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.415\nPrinter won't print.\n\n473\n00:22:19.415 --> 00:22:20.984\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think that's\n\n474\n00:22:20.984 --> 00:22:21.525\nwhy we're doing this episode.\n\n475\n00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:23.103\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that the whole purpose of this\nepisode, is the printer won't print?\n\n476\n00:22:23.103 --> 00:22:28.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so I've got\na laundry list on this one too, and-\n\n477\n00:22:28.224 --> 00:22:29.191\n&gt;&gt; Let's start from the beginning.\n\n478\n00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:32.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wash, rinse, repeat, right?\n\n479\n00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:35.991\nThere's probably some poor guy in the\nshower that has been rinsing his hair for\n\n480\n00:22:35.991 --> 00:22:36.842\nabout five years.\n\n481\n00:22:36.842 --> 00:22:39.353\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It says repeat, I'm bloody.\n\n482\n00:22:39.353 --> 00:22:43.925\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] If you've never\nseen it, you gotta go online and\n\n483\n00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:46.677\nlook up the shampoo prank at the beach.\n\n484\n00:22:46.677 --> 00:22:50.493\nI was rolling on the floor\nlaughing hysterically and\n\n485\n00:22:50.493 --> 00:22:53.451\nbecause [LAUGH] I won't spoil it for you.\n\n486\n00:22:53.451 --> 00:22:54.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't spoil it.\n\n487\n00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:55.148\n&gt;&gt; But definitely go check that out,\nhysterical.\n\n488\n00:22:55.148 --> 00:22:59.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\nstart the episode over.\n\n489\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.140\nJust kidding, guys.\n\n490\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.110\nSo when a printer won't print,\nlet's just kind of break through some.\n\n491\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.560\nPower issues, permission errors, or\npermission configuration issues,\n\n492\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.590\nlack of permissions,\nif you will, paper jams.\n\n493\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.810\nLook for the OCD, OCD, not OCD-\n&gt;&gt; Literally,\n\n494\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.250\nall the things we've been saying.\n\n495\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.085\n&gt;&gt; Right, pretty much everything\nthat we've said, right?\n\n496\n00:23:17.085 --> 00:23:18.809\n&gt;&gt; I wanna know who wrote this.\n\n497\n00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:21.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Out of print media, no toner,\n\n498\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.020\nno ink, missing ribbons, here's one\nthing that I haven't mentioned yet.\n\n499\n00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.640\nLet's go ahead and\nlook at a little diagram I have too.\n\n500\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.990\nBecause we haven't mentioned\nthe thermal printer, right?\n\n501\n00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.490\nThe thermal printer has a heating element,\nright, and\n\n502\n00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.690\nthey have what are called\ndirect thermal printers.\n\n503\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.230\nYou probably said I've never\nseen a direct thermal printer.\n\n504\n00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.978\nYes, you have.\n\n505\n00:23:38.978 --> 00:23:41.155\nAny time you've gotten\na receipt from something,\n\n506\n00:23:41.155 --> 00:23:42.680\nthat is a direct thermal printer.\n\n507\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.290\nPay at the pump,\nthey print a receipt out, guess what?\n\n508\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.435\nThat is a direct thermal printer.\n\n509\n00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:48.930\nCuz it has a series of a heating\nelement that makes a striking\n\n510\n00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.580\ncontact with the paper.\n\n511\n00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.140\nAnd since the paper itself is thermally\nsensitive to heat, if you will,\n\n512\n00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.326\nit changes the color of the paper.\n\n513\n00:23:57.326 --> 00:23:58.439\nNow the problem is,\n\n514\n00:23:58.439 --> 00:24:02.780\nsometimes the heating elements can\neither fail because they got overheat.\n\n515\n00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.020\nPast its lifetime, or they can get\na little bit of debris and dirty in there.\n\n516\n00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.350\nAnd what happens if they\noverheat the paper,\n\n517\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.560\nI want you to think about if\nyou're out of a campfire, right.\n\n518\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.070\nWhat happens to paper when you burn it,\nright?\n\n519\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.690\nYou get a little bit of ash in there,\nright?\n\n520\n00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.740\nWell, there could be\na little bit of residue.\n\n521\n00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.720\nAnd you might just need to clean\nthe heating elements, right?\n\n522\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.010\nThe striking element there too.\n\n523\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.223\nSo that's the other one\nthat I did wanna mention,\n\n524\n00:24:24.223 --> 00:24:27.026\ncuz we really haven't talked\ntoo much about thermal printer.\n\n525\n00:24:27.026 --> 00:24:29.580\nIf you have a missing ribbon,\nif it's an impact printer.\n\n526\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.200\nDamaged print head assemblies.\n\n527\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.320\nHere's another one too.\n\n528\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.690\nDamaged corona wires.\n\n529\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:39.150\nThe corona wires inside of the laser\nprinter itself, if these fail, right,\n\n530\n00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:44.370\nwe don't have, essentially, a pulling\ndown of the toner to the EP drum.\n\n531\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:48.542\nWe don't get the paper that's charged\nthat opposite attrack that actually pull\n\n532\n00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:53.110\nthe toner off of the EP drum down to\nthe paper itself could be the issue too.\n\n533\n00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.310\nDamaged laser assembly\ninside of the printer.\n\n534\n00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.100\nIf the laser assembly has failed,\n\n535\n00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.470\nwell guess what, you're not\ngetting any printed output, right?\n\n536\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.032\nSo that could cause problems.\n\n537\n00:25:02.032 --> 00:25:05.925\nThe other thing too, driver issues and\nmissing drivers, right?\n\n538\n00:25:05.925 --> 00:25:08.480\nWe've talked about some of them\nin our printer technologies.\n\n539\n00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.713\nIf you need a PCL driver, printer control\nlanguage, post printed description, PPD.\n\n540\n00:25:13.713 --> 00:25:18.019\nIf you need a universal print driver for\nthings like your multifunctioning devices,\n\n541\n00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:19.708\nraster bitmap, plot or vector.\n\n542\n00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:25.561\nSo you have to make sure that you have the\nappropriate print drivers too, all right.\n\n543\n00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:29.220\nSome of the other ones that we have too,\nprinter prints in wrong color.\n\n544\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.350\nCould be a configuration issue, right?\n\n545\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.485\nIf you hear something, because of\nthe fact that color prints cost [LAUGH]\n\n546\n00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:42.630\nconsiderably more than black and white,\nthey might actually disable color print.\n\n547\n00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:46.410\nSo you might be expecting color printing\nand you get black and white, right?\n\n548\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.137\nThat's just because their company's\nprobably trying to save money.\n\n549\n00:25:49.137 --> 00:25:52.775\nI've seen it where it's like, okay,\nif you're part of the marketing you better\n\n550\n00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:54.896\nreprint in color,\nwe want things to look good.\n\n551\n00:25:54.896 --> 00:25:57.870\nAnybody else, we're gonna save some money\nand you're gonna print in black and white.\n\n552\n00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.254\nSo it could be a configuration error.\n\n553\n00:26:00.254 --> 00:26:03.530\nHere's the other thing, if it happens\nto be one of those thermal dye\n\n554\n00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.280\ntransfer ribbons, you could have\nissues with the ribbon itself.\n\n555\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.180\nIf it happens to be something\nlike a dye sublimation printer,\n\n556\n00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.330\ncould be having problems\nwith the whole sublime,\n\n557\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:19.066\nnot subliminal, but sublime where it\nchanges from one state to the other.\n\n558\n00:26:19.066 --> 00:26:21.840\nThat's what's cool about\nthe dye sublimation printer.\n\n559\n00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:29.010\nThe fact that it goes from your printing\ncompound, I guess you'd call it the dye,\n\n560\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.900\ngoes from a solid, skips the liquid state,\ngoes right into a gaseous state, and\n\n561\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.410\nthey mix the colors so precision that it's\nas good as photographic quality, right.\n\n562\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.285\nWell, if that isn't happening, guess what,\nyou could have color issues too.\n\n563\n00:26:41.285 --> 00:26:45.710\nIt could be empty color ink cartridges,\nlikewise.\n\n564\n00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.773\nHere's the other thing\nthat might happen too.\n\n565\n00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:52.863\nIf you fail to remove\nthe protective covering on\n\n566\n00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:56.960\ninkjet printerheads, the color cartridges.\n\n567\n00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.850\nI've seen that, where people just popped\nthem and they're like, wait, there's\n\n568\n00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.610\na protective plastic on there, let me pull\nthem out and actually remove the plastic.\n\n569\n00:27:06.052 --> 00:27:08.970\nAll right, so some other things too,\nto round them off here, Dan.\n\n570\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.850\nI know we're coming towards\nthe end of this episode.\n\n571\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.130\nUnable to install the printer.\n\n572\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.313\nThis could be standard user issues,\nthe fact that you don't have\n\n573\n00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:21.271\nadministrator rights to be able to\ndownload and install the driver, right.\n\n574\n00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:24.310\nCould be driver issues,\ncould be compatibility issues, right?\n\n575\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.510\nSo this could be problems too.\n\n576\n00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.460\nError codes, boy,\nthere are a bunch of them.\n\n577\n00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.650\nAnd rather than bore you, guys,\nwith a bunch of different vendor types,\n\n578\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.590\nI want you to know that they're\nunique to the vendor, so check and\n\n579\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:40.730\nresearch the manufacturer's website to\nfind out what the error code might be.\n\n580\n00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.510\nJust it's no different than when we\nwere talking in other episodes about\n\n581\n00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.670\nthings like your post numeric error codes,\nyour post audible beeps, right?\n\n582\n00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.220\nThey're gonna be specific to the vendor.\n\n583\n00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.770\nYou wanna make sure that even within\nthe vendor between different models,\n\n584\n00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.680\nthere might not be a commonality or\na consistencies between them.\n\n585\n00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.230\nSo make sure that you're checking out and\nresearching the manufacturers website.\n\n586\n00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:04.310\nPrinting blank pages, I don't know if\nthat falls under the same category as,\n\n587\n00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.888\nprinter will not print.\n\n588\n00:28:05.888 --> 00:28:10.060\nAll right, but blank pages, again no\ntoner, no ink, no ribbon, could be damaged\n\n589\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.014\nthermal unit, if the fact that, you\nhave one of the direct thermal printers.\n\n590\n00:28:14.014 --> 00:28:18.351\nIf the heating element\nisn't heating the paper,\n\n591\n00:28:18.351 --> 00:28:23.315\nthen guess what,\nyou're just gonna have a blank image.\n\n592\n00:28:23.315 --> 00:28:26.658\nThe protected strip that we talked about\non the ink cartridges that keeps them from\n\n593\n00:28:26.658 --> 00:28:28.023\ndrying out that isn't removed.\n\n594\n00:28:28.023 --> 00:28:32.579\nAnd I've seen that where people get into\na hurry, and they need to print now, and\n\n595\n00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:37.141\nthey pop in all those cartridges, and\nthey forget to remove that plastic strip.\n\n596\n00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:41.461\nAnd it could be come down to\nthe fact that it is just a damaged\n\n597\n00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:44.469\nprinthead assembly outright, right?\n\n598\n00:28:44.469 --> 00:28:45.765\nSo that could be the problem too.\n\n599\n00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:48.340\nAll right, so no image on printer display.\n\n600\n00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.390\nWhat are they talking about here?\n\n601\n00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.070\nWith the little LCD screen that is\non the front of the printer when you\n\n602\n00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.290\nare going to look at local printer errors,\nright?\n\n603\n00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.020\nWe keep telling you,\ncheck the onscreen display, OCD.\n\n604\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.916\nI keep saying OCD, I'll get it right,\nmy OCD is kicking in.\n\n605\n00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:05.940\nOSD, [LAUGH] on-screen display.\n\n606\n00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.470\nIf that display isn't displaying\ninformation, it could be the backlighting\n\n607\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.400\nsource of the front side light, depending\non what kind of lighting source it is.\n\n608\n00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.090\nCould be the fact that you just\nhave to replace that screen.\n\n609\n00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.340\nSo it could be a damaged LCD screen,\nit could be power issues as well.\n\n610\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.570\nMight be the fact that you don't\nsee anything on the screen cuz,\n\n611\n00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.060\nguess what, the printer isn't turned on.\n\n612\n00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.790\nAgain, keep in mind that from\nthe point of these exams,\n\n613\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.370\nI want you to think of easy fixes first.\n\n614\n00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.820\nAnd I say exams, but both 901, 902, but\n\n615\n00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.040\n902 is gonna be focused\na lot more on software.\n\n616\n00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.166\nBut definitely the 901 exam,\nkeep in mind basic fixes first.\n\n617\n00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:40.795\nSo what are some of\nthe things that we can use?\n\n618\n00:29:40.795 --> 00:29:42.055\nA standard maintenance kit.\n\n619\n00:29:42.055 --> 00:29:45.050\nRight, standard maintenance kit\ncould be something like a telescopic\n\n620\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.090\nmagnet that allows you to pull debris out,\ncould be a toner vacuum, all right.\n\n621\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.190\nNow when we say toner vacuum,\nyou say, wait a second, Wes,\n\n622\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.520\nwhat do you mean toner vacuum, right?\n\n623\n00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.490\nI'm talking about the same kind of\ncomputer vacuum that has a filter for\n\n624\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.820\ntoner cloth, cuz you should not\nbe breathe in this stuff in, and\n\n625\n00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.580\nyou certainly should not be\ngetting this on your hands.\n\n626\n00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.593\nAll right, it is a nightmare.\n\n627\n00:30:01.593 --> 00:30:03.766\nIt's very messy, and\nthe fact of the matter is,\n\n628\n00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:07.330\nthat with such a fine particle that when\nit gets on your hands, it kinda smears.\n\n629\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.903\nAnd the first thing you wanna do is,\ngo to warm water and wash it, and\n\n630\n00:30:10.903 --> 00:30:15.106\nguess what, it is so reactive to heat that\neven in the process of using warm soapy\n\n631\n00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:18.410\nwater to wash it off your hands,\nyou will fuse it to your skin.\n\n632\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.528\nIt's not something you wanna mess around\nwith, let alone, breathe it in, right,\n\n633\n00:30:22.528 --> 00:30:24.170\ncuz it's mixed with parts.\n\n634\n00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.666\nI don't know the chemical compounds,\nthis is not a chemistry class.\n\n635\n00:30:27.666 --> 00:30:32.630\nBut I know that very basically,\nit's a mixture of metal and plastic.\n\n636\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.490\nGuess what, it gets into your lungs.\n\n637\n00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.219\nWhat does metal do\nthe moment it hits moisture?\n\n638\n00:30:37.219 --> 00:30:39.500\nAll right,\nunless it's a really good steel.\n\n639\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.970\n[LAUGH] It starts to oxidized, you do\nnot want to stuff in your lungs, right?\n\n640\n00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.750\nIt's not a good day at the office.\n\n641\n00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.930\nCompressed air is another thing,\nremember with compressed air,\n\n642\n00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.150\ndon't shake the can, right?\n\n643\n00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.094\nShort burst, right?\n\n644\n00:30:52.094 --> 00:30:55.847\nSo you keep it from basically,\nessentially condensing and\n\n645\n00:30:55.847 --> 00:30:59.534\nblowing water across whatever\nit is that you're fixing.\n\n646\n00:30:59.534 --> 00:31:01.425\nAnd then also check the prints folder,\nall right.\n\n647\n00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:02.870\nWhat are we talking about prints for?\n\n648\n00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.600\nRemember one of the things that I\nmentioned is that, inside of the software\n\n649\n00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.140\nitself, before the print job is\nactually sent to the print queue,\n\n650\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.630\nwhether it's a local printer or\nwhether it's a print server or\n\n651\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.620\na network printer, it is spooled\nto the hard drive, all right?\n\n652\n00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.060\nThat essentially is what Microsoft,\nin Microsoft land they call the printer.\n\n653\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.220\nAgain, they've got some weird terminology.\n\n654\n00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.480\nTo me, and Dan and I, if I said\nthe printer, I'm looking at the physical\n\n655\n00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.410\ndevice over there,\nthey're looking at the logic inside of it.\n\n656\n00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.260\nHowever, stop and\nrestart the print spooler, right?\n\n657\n00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:33.830\nWhen we get into the operating system,\nI'm gonna show you guys how to do that,\n\n658\n00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.420\ncuz we talked about the services and\nstuff.\n\n659\n00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.299\nAnd that's one of the classic ones that\nI like to show students on stopping and\n\n660\n00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:41.212\nrestarting.\n\n661\n00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:45.140\nThe other thing I want you to understand\nabout the print spooler too, all right?\n\n662\n00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.455\nDan made a joke about\nbacking up your print queue,\n\n663\n00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:49.910\nit's really not a joke, right?\n\n664\n00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.453\nThat happens just because that if there\nis a power failure within your computer,\n\n665\n00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:56.543\nyou can recover the print job and\ncontinue to send it up to the printer.\n\n666\n00:31:56.543 --> 00:31:58.856\nAnd if its a network printer\nit happens locally, and\n\n667\n00:31:58.856 --> 00:32:01.234\nyou have a hard drive in that printer,\npotentially.\n\n668\n00:32:01.234 --> 00:32:05.590\nIf that drive gets full, guess what,\nyou'll lose the ability to print.\n\n669\n00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.401\nSo that's another thing, we don't really\nhave that problem too much anymore which\n\n670\n00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:11.183\nis due to the large capacity of drives.\n\n671\n00:32:11.183 --> 00:32:14.622\nBut, if you're one of these ones who\nlikes to store things like a lot of high\n\n672\n00:32:14.622 --> 00:32:17.530\ndefinition video, it could be\nhappen before you even know it.\n\n673\n00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.620\nSo, again remember the Louisville Slugger\nis not technically part of your\n\n674\n00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:25.040\nmaintenance kit, but in the end\nmight make you feel a little better.\n\n675\n00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.840\n&gt;&gt; In emergency, break glass, right?\n\n676\n00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.000\n[LAUGH] Well, there you go.\n\n677\n00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.190\nThere's obviously quite a bit\nto printer maintenance, and\n\n678\n00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:36.290\nthat's why this basically the bane\nof our IT tech experience, right?\n\n679\n00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.673\nIt's not a lot of fun,\nbecause they'll break and\n\n680\n00:32:38.673 --> 00:32:40.957\nyou'll have no reason\nwhy it should be broken.\n\n681\n00:32:40.957 --> 00:32:44.212\nAnd you're gonna have to walk through\nthis laundry list of things that it could\n\n682\n00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:45.950\npossibly be until you find the right one.\n\n683\n00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.485\nHopefully, right, fingers crossed.\n\n684\n00:32:47.485 --> 00:32:50.540\n[LAUGH] And then, well, looks like\nthe Louisville is coming back out,\n\n685\n00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.830\nand we're gonna buy a new printer.\n\n686\n00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.300\nHey, sometimes that is a viable option.\n\n687\n00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.720\nJust get a whole new device because\nthis thing is broken beyond repair,\n\n688\n00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.050\nthat does happen.\n\n689\n00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:00.890\nWes, we do thank you for\n\n690\n00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.820\nwalking us through this list and\ngiving us the information\n\n691\n00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.530\nthat we'll need to pass the exam if they\nask us questions about repairing printers.\n\n692\n00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:10.576\nDefinitely go over this a couple times,\nand bury that information deep into your\n\n693\n00:33:10.576 --> 00:33:13.880\nbrain cuz you're gonna need it for\nthe exam and real life.\n\n694\n00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.040\nBut it does look like we are out\nof time for this episode.\n\n695\n00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.510\nWe do thank you for watching, though.\n\n696\n00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.050\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n697\n00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:20.748\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n698\n00:33:20.748 --> 00:33:22.838\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n699\n00:33:22.838 --> 00:33:29.025\n[MUSIC]\n\n700\n00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
