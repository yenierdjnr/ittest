--> 00:00:16,500\nin the IT industry,\nif not the most well-known.\n\n4\n00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,080\nIt's designed to certify that you\nhave the equivalent of 6 to 12 months\n\n5\n00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,490\nof field experience supporting\ncomputer hardware and software, right?\n\n6\n00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,877\nIt really kind of covers that, that gamut.\n\n7\n00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:31,699\nThe A+ Certification was created a long,\nquite a long time ago, back in the,\n\n8\n00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,891\nthe 90s, and it was designed to,\n\n9\n00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:37,680\nto help identify who was\na qualified IT support technician.\n\n10\n00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,730\nIf you have somebody come\nto work on your computer,\n\n11\n00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,000\nyou want to know that they actually\nhave the skills to work on it.\n\n12\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,300\nBut, because IT was a, a new career field,\nthere really wasn't a way to do that.\n\n13\n00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,580\nSo, CompTIA,\n\n14\n00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,330\nwhich is the Computer Technology Industry\nAssociation, created this certificate.\n\n15\n00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,810\nThe certification program that said,\n\n16\n00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,370\nif somebody's able to pass the exam, that\nmeans they have this amount of knowledge.\n\n17\n00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,380\nThey have the equivalent of knowledge,\n\n18\n00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,830\nof somebody who's worked six to 12\nmonths in the field, all right?\n\n19\n00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,469\nNow, how does that affect us?\n\n20\n00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:12,958\nWell, what it means is if you're new to\nIT, if you're just getting started and\n\n21\n00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,839\nyou wanna get into IT as a career.\n\n22\n00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:18,449\nYou might have been working with computers\nas a hobby or at home for a long time,\n\n23\n00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:20,418\nyou, you might have\na lot of experience but\n\n24\n00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:23,300\nit's not something you can\nput on a resume, right?\n\n25\n00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,410\nI built my own computer so\n\n26\n00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,830\nI could play video games,\nwell that doesn't look great on a resume.\n\n27\n00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,932\nBut if you can say I have\nthe CompTIA A+ Certification,\n\n28\n00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:35,420\nnow people recognize that you have the\nequivalent experience of somebody who's\n\n29\n00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,260\nalready got a little bit\nof IT work on their resume.\n\n30\n00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,880\nAnd it's a great way to get your\nfoot in the door to a new job.\n\n31\n00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,330\nNow, I mention the Computer\nTechnology Industry Association,\n\n32\n00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,220\nComp TIA, who are they?\n\n33\n00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,580\nWell, they're a non profit organization\nthat it basically, built and supported\n\n34\n00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,120\nby their members, and their members\nare companies like Microsoft, IBM, Apple.\n\n35\n00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760\nThere's a number of different,\nhuge, technology companies,\n\n36\n00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,780\nthat all contribute to CompTIA.\n\n37\n00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,422\nBecause, all of these companies benefit\nfrom having well trained technicians to\n\n38\n00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:11,121\neither go out in the field to do\nwarranty repairs and services, or\n\n39\n00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,900\nmaybe its the phone support personnel,\nright?\n\n40\n00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,180\nPeople that can answer the phone and\nhelp you through a problem.\n\n41\n00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,440\nThey want to make sure that people\nmeet a basic level of competency,\n\n42\n00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160\nsupporting computers.\n\n43\n00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,918\nNow the CompTIA exam itself has seen\nseveral updates over the years and\n\n44\n00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:27,520\nit's kinda changed forms a few times.\n\n45\n00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,571\nIn its current form,\nit's actually two exams.\n\n46\n00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,842\nIt's actually been two exams for\na long time, but the, but\n\n47\n00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:34,400\nthe two exams have changed a little bit.\n\n48\n00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,405\nIn the new version of the certification,\nthe first exam focuses mostly on hardware,\n\n49\n00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:42,770\nso you study hardware based topics.\n\n50\n00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,405\nWhat each piece of hardware\ninside of a computer does,\n\n51\n00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:48,360\nand how to repair or\ntroubleshoot and diagnose, those,\n\n52\n00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,430\nthose pieces in the event that\none's not working properly.\n\n53\n00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,920\nThe second exam is focused\nmore on the software.\n\n54\n00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,390\nSo, how to install an operating system,\nhow to perform basic tasks,\n\n55\n00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,860\nhow to troubleshoot, and identify issues\nwhen you're working with the software.\n\n56\n00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,580\nNow COMPTIA tries to be vendor\nneutral with everything.\n\n57\n00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,180\nThey try to support as many\nvendors as possible, and so\n\n58\n00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,260\nyou'll see mentions of Microsoft Windows,\nApple's Mac OS, and\n\n59\n00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,330\nLinux, various Linux\ndistributions throughout.\n\n60\n00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,930\nBut for the most part it's a fairly\nWindows-centric certification.\n\n61\n00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,210\nThe first exam is hardware so you\nreally don't deal with OS's at all, but\n\n62\n00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,080\nthe second exam does lean a little\nmore towards Windows because\n\n63\n00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,540\nthat's the primary operating system\nthat's found on most business desktops.\n\n64\n00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,663\nSo you need to have a, a little bit more\nWindows skill on your resume because\n\n65\n00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:37,029\nthat's whats out there the most, right?\n\n66\n00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:40,332\nAnd that may change over time,\nand CompTIA changes over time, so\n\n67\n00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,760\nthey adapt their exam to reflect that.\n\n68\n00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,980\nThe newest version of the exam actually\nhas some sections of mobile technology,\n\n69\n00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,350\nlike cell phones and tablets,\nbecause those are so prevalent and\n\n70\n00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,700\nvery few of those actually\nrun Microsoft Windows.\n\n71\n00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,904\nSo, it's, it's kind of neat to see that\ncertification evolve over the years.\n\n72\n00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,850\nNow, CompTIA A+ holds\na special place in my heart,\n\n73\n00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,320\nbecause it is the very first IT\ncertification that I ever got.\n\n74\n00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,150\nI had worked a few odds and\nends, you know, various IT,\n\n75\n00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,020\nkinda, side jobs, but\nwhen I was in college and, and\n\n76\n00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,150\ngoing through school I decided\nI wanted to get into IT.\n\n77\n00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,160\nBut I, I didn't have any documented\nexperience on my resume, and so\n\n78\n00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,830\nI was in the same situation\na lot of you are in today.\n\n79\n00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,740\nI said, well how can I get\nan IT job if people don't see\n\n80\n00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,340\nexactly what I've been doing, if they know\nthat I've actually got that experience?\n\n81\n00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,290\nHow do I at least get them to call me for\nan interview?\n\n82\n00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,830\nThey see my resume,\nhow am I gonna make them call?\n\n83\n00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,390\nAnd I went out and I did research and\nI learned about the A+, and I studied and\n\n84\n00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,940\ngot that certification,\nthat led t my first hardware support job.\n\n85\n00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,110\nI was doing, warranty repair for\nPackard-Bell, and\n\n86\n00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,980\nif any of you guys remember Packard-Bell,\nI was really busy.\n\n87\n00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,470\nSo that, that was kinda how I started and\nthen my career just went on from there.\n\n88\n00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,540\nI pursued other certifications and\nmoved up.\n\n89\n00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,240\nSo this is really the ground level for\n\n90\n00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,300\nan IT career, getting started\nin IT CompTIA A+ is for you.\n\n91\n00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,930\nIf you've already got 15\nyears of experience, or\n\n92\n00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,340\n20 years of experience working in IT,\n\n93\n00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,900\nyou've done all sorts of stuff, you\ndon't really need the A+ certification.\n\n94\n00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,720\nUnless, unless there is an employer\nthat absolutely requires it,\n\n95\n00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,460\nyou shouldn't do it, you should move\nup to a more advanced certification.\n\n96\n00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,478\nRight?\nOnce you have advanced certifications,\n\n97\n00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,390\nhigher end ones, you don't need\nthe lower end certifications anymore.\n\n98\n00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,198\nSo, you can either let them go,\nif you already certified, or\n\n99\n00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,680\nyou can just skip them and,\nand not do them.\n\n100\n00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,180\nBut if you're just getting started,\nthe entry level certifications are a must.\n\n101\n00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,190\nIt's what's gonna get that hiring\nmanager to, to call you for\n\n102\n00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,130\nan interview when they see your resume,\nright?\n\n103\n00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,920\nBecause your resume might\nbe light on experience.\n\n104\n00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,170\nThat's who this is really designed for.\n\n105\n00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,110\nAll right now the A+ certification,\nit is a bit of an undertaking,\n\n106\n00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,280\nyou've gotta really be ready for this one.\n\n107\n00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,340\nSo, if you are certain that moving into\nan IT career is what you want to do,\n\n108\n00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,780\nthis is your starting point.\n\n109\n00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,680\nIf you still haven't made up your mind,\nif you're considering a career in IT,\n\n110\n00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,730\nthe A+ certification is,\nis a little more aggressive than,\n\n111\n00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,240\nthan what you probably want to deal with.\n\n112\n00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,710\nSo if you're really just testing\nthe waters, I recommend you go and\n\n113\n00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,630\ntake a look at the COMPTIA IT Fundamentals\ncertification.\n\n114\n00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,210\nAll right?\n\n115\n00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,990\nIt's a smaller amount of data,\nit's a little more entry level, and\n\n116\n00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,340\nit's a lower cost.\n\n117\n00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,140\nIt's easier to study for\nand easier to attain, and\n\n118\n00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,100\nit'll give you that chance to see if\nthis is right for you, all right?\n\n119\n00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,070\nIf it is great, A+ is your next step,\njump in right here and, and we'll go.\n\n120\n00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,274\nBut if you do the IT fundamentals and you\nsay, you know, this just isn't right for\n\n121\n00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:22,780\nme I, I,\nI don't think IT's the right option.\n\n122\n00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,300\nYou can stop right there and\nyou haven't invested a bunch of time and\n\n123\n00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,330\nmoney into a certification\nthat isn't right for you.\n\n124\n00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,530\nSo, CompTIA IT Fundamentals is for\npeople who are on the fence, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,070\nBut if you know that IT\nis what you want and\n\n126\n00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,393\nyou just don't have don't have\nexperience on your resume,\n\n127\n00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:40,060\nthe A+, this is a great place to be,\nyou're in the right spot.\n\n128\n00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,740\nNow, it's a big undertaking.\n\n129\n00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,781\nThe A+ certification covers\nmore content than any\n\n130\n00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,759\nother certification we've\ncovered on ITProTV.\n\n131\n00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,279\nAll right?\n\n132\n00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,237\nThat means there's more episodes,\nmore content, more data,\n\n133\n00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:56,468\nmore stuff to learn than any of\nthe other certifications, more than,\n\n134\n00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:59,910\nthan several of the other\ncertifications combined.\n\n135\n00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,680\nThe exam is broken up into two exams, and\n\n136\n00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,350\neach exam has a,\na amount of data that's covered by it\n\n137\n00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,030\nthat's equal to just about any other\ncertification we have on our site.\n\n138\n00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,750\nSo, it is a lot and the exams are fairly\nexpensive, so there is a bit of a cost.\n\n139\n00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,160\nWhen you go to take these, the combined\ncost of the two exams is a little\n\n140\n00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,890\nover $300 U.S., which makes it one of the\nmore expensive certifications to attain.\n\n141\n00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,380\nBut, it's got a lot of value,\nit's got a lot of recognition, and\n\n142\n00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,220\nit's a great certification to get.\n\n143\n00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,800\nAll right?\n\n144\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,850\nI got my A+ certification in 1999, so 15,\noh almost 16 years ago, but 15 years ago.\n\n145\n00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,910\nAnd that was a, a,\na great start to my career back then,\n\n146\n00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,990\ngot me moving forward, and really did help\nwith moving into those advanced areas.\n\n147\n00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,583\nAnd, and for you guys it kind of works\nthe same, it is a great starting point.\n\n148\n00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,595\nNow, the A+ certification is\na expiring certification, and\n\n149\n00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:56,140\nwhat that means is every two years\nyour certification will expire, and\n\n150\n00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,958\nwhen that happens you've got two choices.\n\n151\n00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:03,633\nEither one, you take the exam again,\nand that keeps it up to date and\n\n152\n00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:07,917\nnow you're renewed, or two,\nyou do continuing education.\n\n153\n00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:11,417\nWith CompTIA they expect you\nto keep learning, don't stop.\n\n154\n00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,793\nOnce you get your A+ certification, you\nshould then be looking at the next thing.\n\n155\n00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:18,820\nMaybe you wanna go for the Microsoft MCSA\nor maybe you wanna do the Cisco CCENT or\n\n156\n00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,140\nmaybe you wanna do Network+, Security+,\n\n157\n00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,008\nwhatever you start looking\nat other certifications and\n\n158\n00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:28,030\nthat continues your education and\nkeeps your A+ current, all right?\n\n159\n00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,190\nBut if you ever stop.\n\n160\n00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,310\nSit back and just rest on your laurels and\nsay, you know what?\n\n161\n00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,710\nI got my job, I'm good.\n\n162\n00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,050\nI'm not gonna do any more studying.\n\n163\n00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,850\nWell, after two years,\nyour A+ certification will expire and\n\n164\n00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,250\nyou'll no longer have\na current certification.\n\n165\n00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,270\nYou can still say, yes I was A+ certified.\n\n166\n00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,230\nI passed that exam.\n\n167\n00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,770\nYou can say that.\n\n168\n00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,320\nThat's, that's perfectly fine.\n\n169\n00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,950\nBut your no longer current, and that means\nthat the exam you took back then might\n\n170\n00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,698\nhave been based on older technology.\n\n171\n00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,900\nMine, that I took and I, you know,\nI I took the exam way back in 1999.\n\n172\n00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,778\nMy exam covered Windows 95 and\nsome Windows 3.1, I had a lot of old\n\n173\n00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:03,722\ntechnology that was on that exam\nbecause that was out there at the time,\n\n174\n00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:06,180\nthere was still people\nusing it at the time.\n\n175\n00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,378\nAnd today its not like that right\nthose nobody runs Windows 95 or\n\n176\n00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:12,069\nWindows 3.1 anymore.\n\n177\n00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:15,130\nSo the knowledge gets outdated and\nthat's why you've got to keep it current.\n\n178\n00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,130\nThat's why CompTIA has\nthe expiring rotation.\n\n179\n00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,850\nWell, that, that and\nit's an ANSI certified certification.\n\n180\n00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,570\nAnd in order to be ANSI certified\nyou have to do continuing education,\n\n181\n00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,600\nthat's part of the, the rules.\n\n182\n00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,910\nAll right, so if you wanna get certified,\n\n183\n00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,460\nwell it's a good idea to learn\na little bit about the certification.\n\n184\n00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,630\nSo let's take a look at CompTIA's webpage.\n\n185\n00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,760\nCompTIA has a ton of certifications.\n\n186\n00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,100\nIf you go to certification.comptia.org you\ncan pull up their list right here under\n\n187\n00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,620\nGet Certified and they have a whole list\nof all these different certifications.\n\n188\n00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,850\nMost of them are very specialized.\n\n189\n00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,330\nAnd A+ is where you want to start, right?\n\n190\n00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,333\nThe A+ certification itself, well,\n\n191\n00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,500\nthey just kind of layout exactly\nwhat I said a few moments ago.\n\n192\n00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,720\nIt's ANSI certified, certifies\nthe 6 to 12 months of experience.\n\n193\n00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,760\nIt's available for IT support technicians,\nadministrators, specialists and\n\n194\n00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,150\nthose different job roles.\n\n195\n00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,820\nVery flexible, you know, in,\nin it's very well known.\n\n196\n00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,240\nBut what they don't mention immediately\nhere is that it is two different exams and\n\n197\n00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,380\nso we'll see that right down here.\n\n198\n00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,460\nRequired exams.\n\n199\n00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,610\nThere's the 220-801, which is the one\nthat's software I mean, hardware centric.\n\n200\n00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,500\nAnd then there's the 220-802 that's\nthe one that is software centric.\n\n201\n00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,630\nIf you're going out and buying books to\nstudy with, make sure that they're for\n\n202\n00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,180\nthe 220-801 and 802,\nthat's the most current version.\n\n203\n00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,660\nThere have been previous versions and\n\n204\n00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,500\nso if you find a book that's on sale,\na lot of times it'll be for\n\n205\n00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,110\none of the older version of the exams and\nit might not get you ready for the exam.\n\n206\n00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,530\nIt might be fine, it might not.\n\n207\n00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,524\nYou, you kinda take that risk.\n\n208\n00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:46,617\nNow each exam is performance based, so\nwhen you do the exam you'll have multiple\n\n209\n00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:49,567\nchoice questions, but\nyou'll also have simulations and\n\n210\n00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,879\nwhat they call hotspot questions\nwhere they show you a picture and\n\n211\n00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,030\nyou have to click on something\nbased on the question.\n\n212\n00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,740\nSo it's fairly interactive and\nquestions are weighted differently, and\n\n213\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,000\nthat means no two people\nhave the exact same exam and\n\n214\n00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,640\nthey may have a very differing\namount of questions.\n\n215\n00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,530\nSo they tell us that it's\na maximum of 90 questions.\n\n216\n00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,804\nI've heard of people having\nas few as 40 questions.\n\n217\n00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,452\nIt just depends on which\nquestions you draw there,\n\n218\n00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:18,593\nthere randomly pulled from this pool of,\nof questions, and\n\n219\n00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:22,940\nif you're getting a lot of high point\nquestions you'll have less of them.\n\n220\n00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,230\nBut if you have a lot of low point\nquestions, you'll get more of them.\n\n221\n00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,910\nSo up to 90 questions.\n\n222\n00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,380\nThe exam is 90 minutes, so\nnot a whole heck of a lot of time.\n\n223\n00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,907\nYou don't wanna dally around in the exam.\n\n224\n00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:36,580\nYou need to know the information,\nso you can answer the question and\n\n225\n00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,058\nmove to the next one, and\nnot have to sit there and think and, and\n\n226\n00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,325\ntry and reason out an answer, all right?\n\n227\n00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:48,920\nNow, the past scores for the exam for\nthe 801 to 675 out of 900, all right.\n\n228\n00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,320\nSo, you've gotta basically get two\nout of every three questions right to\n\n229\n00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,940\npass the exam.\n\n230\n00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,140\nThat's, that's not, not too bad.\n\n231\n00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,790\nIt's a little bit harder for\nthe second exam.\n\n232\n00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,210\nThe software one is a 700 out of 900,\nso you've got to get a few more right\n\n233\n00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,040\nthan on the other, but it's a pretty\nreasonable bar to set, right?\n\n234\n00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,400\nIt's not something that's, that's hard to\nattain if you've studied and prepared.\n\n235\n00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,220\nNow when you sign up for the exam, you can\npick which language you wanna take it in.\n\n236\n00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,430\nThe exam is written in English, and\nthen translated to the other languages.\n\n237\n00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,140\nSo if you know English, it's always better\nto take it that way cuz that's what it's\n\n238\n00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,430\nactually written in when it's designed.\n\n239\n00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,553\nBut if your, your native language is, is\nJapanese and you don't speak English, or\n\n240\n00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:31,677\nyou speak very little English, then you'd\nbe better off taking the Japanese exam,\n\n241\n00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:35,355\nand that way its at least in your language\nyour not having to deal with that.\n\n242\n00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,939\nBut sometimes when they translate a\nquestion from one language to another they\n\n243\n00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:42,139\nlose a little bit, so I always\nencourage people to take it in English,\n\n244\n00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:45,200\nif they're fluent in English,\nright but you don't have to.\n\n245\n00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,840\nAll right.\nAnd the exams are actually\n\n246\n00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,940\nproctored through a company\ncalled Pearson VUE.\n\n247\n00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,180\nSo when you're ready to take the exam\nyou locate a Pearson VUE testing\n\n248\n00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,780\ncenter near you.\n\n249\n00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,310\nThey're all over the world.\n\n250\n00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,080\nYou can normally find one very close\nby and you can go and take the exam.\n\n251\n00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,380\nThat's where you go to sign up.\n\n252\n00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,860\nYou can go to the Pearson VUE website and\nyou know, I thought they had a link on for\n\n253\n00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,240\nit but I guess they don't.\n\n254\n00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,036\nSo but if you go to Pearson VUE's\nwebsite which is just vue.com.\n\n255\n00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:14,281\nYou can go to their website and\nyou go up here to this for\n\n256\n00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:18,420\ntest takers section and you can come\nin and go to the test taker home.\n\n257\n00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,860\nIt'll let you find the testing\ncenter that's near you.\n\n258\n00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,030\nAnd then you can sign up for the exam.\n\n259\n00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,790\nSo we just tell it that we're looking for\nour CompTIA exam.\n\n260\n00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,129\nSo we'll find them here in the list.\n\n261\n00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,930\nSomewhere in the list right there.\n\n262\n00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,370\nAnd then we can pick our exams and\ngo get certified.\n\n263\n00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,033\nSo you'll see, like IT Fundamentals and\nSecurity+, and\n\n264\n00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,439\nsome of the different other\nones that are available.\n\n265\n00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,794\nYou can find a test center right here, and\n\n266\n00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:44,783\nthen you can schedule the exam to\nget to get ready to go and take it.\n\n267\n00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:45,352\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:48,639\nNow when you take the exam,\nhopefully you pass the first time.\n\n269\n00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,495\nWhen you pass that 801 exam you get,\nwell, nothing.\n\n270\n00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,880\nYou get pass report, and, and that's it.\n\n271\n00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,960\nWhen you pass the second one,\nwhen you pass the 801 and 802,\n\n272\n00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,200\nthen you're awarded your\nCompTIA A+ certification,\n\n273\n00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,290\nso you do need to do both of them\nto get the certification, right?\n\n274\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,100\nIf you don't pass the first time,\nyou can take the exam again.\n\n275\n00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,590\nIt's not a one shot thing, so\nyou can always take it again.\n\n276\n00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,668\nYou will have to pay for\nthe exam again though, so study hard.\n\n277\n00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,760\nYou don't wanna have to take the exam\ntwice if you don't you know,\n\n278\n00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,420\ndon't wanna waste the money.\n\n279\n00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,517\nAnother thing is if you read through\nall these exam objectives and\n\n280\n00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:24,401\nyou're comfortable with it all, if you\ndidn't learn anything new, then you can\n\n281\n00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:28,287\nactually take the combined exam where they\nmerge them together into one big exam,\n\n282\n00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:28,873\nall right.\n\n283\n00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:33,350\nNow it's questions pulled form\nthe same pool as the other two.\n\n284\n00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,190\nSo you just get less of each, right.\n\n285\n00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,170\nSo you still get a maximum\nof 90 questions, but\n\n286\n00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,550\nthey're drawn from the two exams.\n\n287\n00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,400\nAnd when you pass that one composite exam,\nyou get the certification immediately.\n\n288\n00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,870\nThat's a good option for\npeople with experience.\n\n289\n00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,820\nIt does not save you any money.\n\n290\n00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,950\nThe combined exam costs just as\nmuch as the two separate exams.\n\n291\n00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,520\nAnd so what I do is I normally encourage\npeople to take the separate exams.\n\n292\n00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,960\nBecause you can divide\nthe content in half.\n\n293\n00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,950\nYou can kind of focus in on\none area versus the other and\n\n294\n00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,130\nthen go and pass them.\n\n295\n00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,230\nAnd if, unfortunately, you don't pass\none of them, well it's just one.\n\n296\n00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,940\nYou may well pass the other one.\n\n297\n00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,940\nAnd so, it makes it a little bit\nless painful to have to retake.\n\n298\n00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,700\nBut, you can do the combined exam.\n\n299\n00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,822\nThey they have the exam number for\nthat somewhere around here.\n\n300\n00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:16,717\nPersonally, eh, you know, when I did it\neven back then, I, I did the two separate\n\n301\n00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:20,410\nexams just because that's generally\nwhat what I like to recommend.\n\n302\n00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,300\nAll right.\nSo the certification's pretty\n\n303\n00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,880\nstraightforward.\n\n304\n00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,260\nLet's just take a quick glance at\nsome of the things that are covered.\n\n305\n00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,588\nYou can go on their website and\ndownload the exam objectives.\n\n306\n00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:32,122\nI, I'm not gonna do it live because they,\nthey make you, you know,\n\n307\n00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:34,206\nprovide your name and\nemail address and all that stuff.\n\n308\n00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,040\nBut but here's the 220-801 exam and\n\n309\n00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,635\njust to take a quick scan along\nit you'll see how its divided,\n\n310\n00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:44,923\nthe bulk of it 40% of that exam is\nbased on PC hardware, motherboards,\n\n311\n00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:50,900\nprocessors, ram, hard drives, all of the\ndifferent components inside of a system.\n\n312\n00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,740\nAnother 27% are tied to network.\n\n313\n00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,960\nThat's been growing over the years\nbecause networking is so important now.\n\n314\n00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,810\nIt used to have a very,\nvery small piece of the exam.\n\n315\n00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,542\nNow it's 27%.\n\n316\n00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,625\nSo we'll tackle networking right there.\n\n317\n00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,517\nLaptops have special needs and\nspecial hardware, so\n\n318\n00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,583\nthey're another 11% of the exam.\n\n319\n00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,500\nPrinters are 11%.\n\n320\n00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,381\nI know a lot of us don't use printers\nanymore, but in most businesses, printers\n\n321\n00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:17,333\nare essential, and there's things we can\ndo to keep them operating and healthy.\n\n322\n00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,520\nAnd then lastly is operational procedures.\n\n323\n00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,630\nThese are more like life skills.\n\n324\n00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,300\nBasic troubleshooting steps how\nto interact with a customer,\n\n325\n00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300\ninterpersonal skills,\nproper ethics, that kind of thing\n\n326\n00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,830\nthat are general responsibilities\nof anybody in the IT field.\n\n327\n00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,330\nThat's the remaining 11%.\n\n328\n00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,070\nSo, that's what this\nexam is broken down into.\n\n329\n00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,890\nNow if you download this document they\nactually do break it all the way down into\n\n330\n00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,890\nthe individual pieces.\n\n331\n00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,220\nSo exactly what types of power\nsupplies you need to know and\n\n332\n00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,730\nvideo cards and so on.\n\n333\n00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,140\nAnd you'll see it's a lot.\n\n334\n00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,610\nThere's a lot in here.\n\n335\n00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,120\nWe've got a 22 page document, the bulk\nof which is the outline of topics.\n\n336\n00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,040\nSo, this is what you should be\nbuilding your studies around, and\n\n337\n00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,830\nthis is what we build our shows around.\n\n338\n00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,960\nWhen we film the A plus shows,\nwe go through these objectives,\n\n339\n00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,240\nmaking sure we cover every one.\n\n340\n00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,650\nNow, there is a little problem.\n\n341\n00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,110\nWhich is, it's very difficult to separate\nout the software from the hardware,\n\n342\n00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,140\nbecause they work together.\n\n343\n00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,800\nAnd so, at ITProTV,\nwhat we decided to do was to go ahead and\n\n344\n00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,770\ncombine the two sets of objectives, so\nthat we'd cover them at the same time.\n\n345\n00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,630\nSo, on our site, you won't see\na separation between 801 and 802.\n\n346\n00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,680\nWe combined them.\n\n347\n00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,160\nAnd if you study them all at the same\ntime, there's a lot of overlap, and\n\n348\n00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,330\nyou benefit from that.\n\n349\n00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,750\nSo, you're actually studying for\nboth exams at the same time.\n\n350\n00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,960\nYou can still take the exams separately,\nor\n\n351\n00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,070\nyou can take them combined too,\nit's up to you.\n\n352\n00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,880\nBut we run through and deal with all this,\njust because of the overlap.\n\n353\n00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,550\nFor example, it's hard to see\nif your network is working\n\n354\n00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,800\nwithout going into your\noperating system to test it.\n\n355\n00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,820\nSo all networking is covered\nright here in the first exam.\n\n356\n00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,370\nWe need the OS from the second\nexam to be able to test and\n\n357\n00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,410\nsee it in action, so\nthat's why we combine them.\n\n358\n00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,880\nSo what I'm looking at here is\njust the 801, that first exam.\n\n359\n00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,730\nThe second exam, the 802 focuses\non the operating system, and\n\n360\n00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,360\nyou'll see operating systems makes\nup a full third of the exam.\n\n361\n00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,530\nSecurity makes up almost\n25% of the rest of it.\n\n362\n00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,700\nThat is because security's become such\na hot topic these days, you know, so\n\n363\n00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,110\nmany companies make simple mistakes.\n\n364\n00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,180\nMistakes that cost them\na lot in the long run,\n\n365\n00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,240\nbecause they didn't take\nbasic security practices.\n\n366\n00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,980\nWe've also got mobile devices, I know I\nmentioned that earlier laptops, tablets,\n\n367\n00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,820\ncellphones.\n\n368\n00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,410\nThese things are really starting\nto become more prominent, and so\n\n369\n00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,660\nthey're on the exam.\n\n370\n00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,910\nAnd then trouble shooting skills is\nprobably the most valuable thing you'll\n\n371\n00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,700\nlearn from the certification is a\nstructured approach to troubleshooting and\n\n372\n00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,010\nresolving an issue, very valuable.\n\n373\n00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,820\nCompTIA has their own methodology\nthat they want you to follow, and\n\n374\n00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,499\nit's a good thing to learn.\n\n375\n00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,000\nAnd this one gets broken down into\nits individual components too and\n\n376\n00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,360\nyou'll see where it breaks it apart.\n\n377\n00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,050\nAnd, and notice here's all this Windows\nheavy content right at the beginning.\n\n378\n00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,860\nSo a lot of Windows stuff in there,\nbut you'll also see Linux and\n\n379\n00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,825\nMac OS kind of spattered\nthrough in different places.\n\n380\n00:18:56,825 --> 00:19:00,355\nSo like, as we look at some of these\ncommands that you have to learn,\n\n381\n00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,755\nsome of these commands\naren't Windows commands.\n\n382\n00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:07,235\nThey might be something that we use on a,\non a a Linux box or whatever.\n\n383\n00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,065\nSo, keep that in mind\nas you go through it,\n\n384\n00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,245\nthat they do try to be vendor\nneutral when possible.\n\n385\n00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,040\nAll right, so, I'm not gonna bore you\nguys with going through all of those.\n\n386\n00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,200\nYou get a chance to see that with the\nepisode but hopefully in this overview you\n\n387\n00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,330\nlearned a little bit about\nthe CompTIA certification, or\n\n388\n00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,300\nthe CompTIA A+ certification and\nyou know whether it's right for you.\n\n389\n00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,130\nRemember what I said, I'm serious about\nthis, that A+ is not right for everybody.\n\n390\n00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,780\nIf you're not sure about moving into an IT\ncareer, you're better off to start with\n\n391\n00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,850\nthe CompTIA fundamentals because\nthere's less risk, right, less time,\n\n392\n00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,750\nless money involved, it's easier to\nattain and get you started, right.\n\n393\n00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,500\nBut, if you're moving\nforward with IT as a career,\n\n394\n00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,910\nif you know this is what you want,\nA+ is where you start and\n\n395\n00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,140\nit's hard work, it's a lot of content,\nit's a lot of episodes.\n\n396\n00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,660\nYou need to study, hit those books hard\nand when you look down this outline,\n\n397\n00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,840\nthat I was scrolling through\nreally fast on the screen,\n\n398\n00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,730\nyou shouldn't be surprised by\nanything that shows up there.\n\n399\n00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,360\nYou should be able to describe every\nsingle entry that you see in that\n\n400\n00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,870\noutline, it's a lot.\n\n401\n00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,623\nIt's a lot of work, but the reward\nis a life time of an IT career and\n\n402\n00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:08,216\nthe IT industry is only growing,\nso this is,\n\n403\n00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:11,730\nis one of the more rewarding\ncertifications to get.\n\n404\n00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,540\nAnd it can change your life, you know,\n\n405\n00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,720\nmoving from working in a fast\nfood restaurant to working in IT.\n\n406\n00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,790\nIt, it's a lifestyle change.\n\n407\n00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,380\nIt really is.\n\n408\n00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,840\nIt's a, it's a big improvement, so\ndefinitely something that a lot of people\n\n409\n00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,400\nare looking to do, and\nthis is where it starts.\n\n410\n00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,180\nAll right, well, if that sounds exciting\nto you, you're in the right place.\n\n411\n00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,720\nStay tuned.\n\n412\n00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,950\nWe've got A plus episodes coming up.\n\n413\n00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,600\nIf it's not right for you, no,\nno hard feelings there, right?\n\n414\n00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,850\nWe got plenty of certifications\non ITProTV, browse around.\n\n415\n00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,910\nYou'll find one that you like sooner or\nlater.\n\n416\n00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,470\nAnd best of luck in that certification but\nfor\n\n417\n00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,710\nthe rest of you,\nI'll see you in the episodes.\n\n418\n00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,405\nAnd good luck on your exam.\n\n419\n00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:52,040\n[NOISE]\n\n",
