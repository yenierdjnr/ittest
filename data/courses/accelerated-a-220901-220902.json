00:00:08.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:12.053\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.053\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:16.748\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:20.808\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're actually starting\n\n7\n00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:24.579\noff our accelerated A+ course,\nkinda taking the best of 902 and 901,\n\n8\n00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.537\nslamming them together, and\ngiving you just what you need so\n\n9\n00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:31.180\nthat you can get into that exam booth and\npass it as soon as possible.\n\n10\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.690\nThis does assume some knowledge, of\ncourse, because, well, we're accelerated.\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.280\nWe 're hoping that you've\nsome basic foundational\n\n12\n00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.890\nknowledge already underneath your belt.\n\n13\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.160\nIf so,\nthis is definitely the course for you.\n\n14\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.637\nJoining us to help steer this ship,\nto help get you to where you need to be,\n\n15\n00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:48.170\nwhich is A+ certified,\nour good friend and mentor, Mr Wes Brian.\n\n16\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.566\nWes, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n17\n00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.150\nHow's it going today?\n\n18\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.800\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n19\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.980\nGreat to dive in to this acceleration or\naccelerated show, like Dan says.\n\n20\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.774\nAnd that's right, we're gonna be\nlooking at our operating system today.\n\n21\n00:00:57.774 --> 00:00:59.570\nAnd let's say our operating system.\n\n22\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.490\nLet's go ahead and be a little bit more\nspecific than that cuz there is a few of\n\n23\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.890\nthem out there, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.120\nMore specifically, we're gonna be looking\nat the Windows operating system and\n\n25\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.530\nsome of the things that you should know\nwhen it comes making a choice, well,\n\n26\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.900\nwhich Windows edition do I get inside\nof my computer, which one should I get,\n\n27\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.946\nas well as some of the features\nthat are available.\n\n28\n00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:22.170\nAnd then finally, what we're gonna look at\nis a little bit about the installation of\n\n29\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.180\nthe operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.830\nNow, one of the first things that we're\ngonna start out by, if you're gonna talk\n\n31\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.000\nabout Windows in general, is just,\nwell, what basically is Windows, right?\n\n32\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.210\nWell, the Windows Operating System,\nbasically,\n\n33\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.810\nlike any other operating system,\nit allows you to control your hardware.\n\n34\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.110\nThe Windows Operating System is gonna\nbe a good majority of your A+ exam.\n\n35\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.990\nAnd one of the reasons that is, is because\nhistorically, it's had pretty much\n\n36\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.380\nthe majority of the Enterprise market when\nit comes to PC in general, computers.\n\n37\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.500\nNow, you'll notice that in other episodes\nwe do talk about the Mac operating system,\n\n38\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.290\nwe talk about the Linux operating system.\n\n39\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.889\nSo understand that I'm not saying\none is better than the other.\n\n40\n00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.040\nThey all have their goods and sometimes\nthey all have their drawbacks at times.\n\n41\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.180\nBut an operating system essentially\nis an operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.450\nIt allows you access to the hardware.\n\n43\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.534\nNow, Windows, one of the things\nthat kinda made Windows really,\n\n44\n00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.848\nreally famous is they\nkinda revolutionized, and\n\n45\n00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:22.924\nthey certainly weren't the first to invent\nit, but they definitely revolutionized,\n\n46\n00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:26.028\nit was a Graphical User Interface and\nPoint and Click technology.\n\n47\n00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:28.907\nLike I said, if you do a little\nbit of historical research,\n\n48\n00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:32.363\nwhich really isn't gonna benefit you\non the exam, is the fact that they\n\n49\n00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:35.900\nweren't the first ones to do\nthe Graphical User Interface by any means.\n\n50\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.450\nBut again, it became very,\nvery common in the Enterprise market due\n\n51\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.240\nto things like the tenacity of\nBill Gates and marketing, if you will.\n\n52\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.580\nNow, that being said, if you are gonna\ninstall a Windows operating system,\n\n53\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.790\none of the first things that you need to\nknow about your operating system is what\n\n54\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.270\narchitecture are you going to use,\nall right?\n\n55\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.620\nWhen we talk about the architecture\nthat you're gonna use,\n\n56\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.810\nwell, there are two different\ntypes of architecture.\n\n57\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.620\nActually, it's really three\ntypes of architectures.\n\n58\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.440\nBut I will go ahead,\n\n59\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250\nI'll mention only two that I really\nthink that you have to worry about.\n\n60\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.970\nWe have what's known as\n32-bit architecture.\n\n61\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.510\nYou have what's known\nas 64-bit architecture.\n\n62\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.420\nNow, the third one is actually\nsomething called ARM architecture,\n\n63\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.030\nthat's the Advanced Risk Machine,\nthat's more for mobile devices.\n\n64\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.130\nAnd we do have later additions of Windows,\nas late as Windows 10.\n\n65\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.550\nDon't worry about that for the exam.\n\n66\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.660\nBut at the time of the recording,\n\n67\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.190\nI just mention it because\nit it a ARM-based solution.\n\n68\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.850\nHowever-\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, Wes, this is,\n\n69\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.980\nwhen you say architecture,\nthis is when I look at maybe a download or\n\n70\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.930\nsomething it says 32-bit or\n64-bit, or x86 or x86_64, right?\n\n71\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.630\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great question because\nthat's where it gets confusing, right?\n\n72\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.709\nAll those numbers.\n\n73\n00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.256\nWhy couldn't they just stick with one,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:49.501\n&gt;&gt; I don't know [LAUGH].\n\n75\n00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:50.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, what is x86?\n\n76\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.760\nWhat does that mean?\n\n77\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.530\nWell, when you first start out, well,\nwhen computers first started out,\n\n78\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.880\nit was basically led by Intel, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.360\nOne of the most major microprocessing,\nand today we just call the processor CPU.\n\n80\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.710\nProcessor companies in the world.\n\n81\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.736\nWell, when they started out,\nthey started out with really an 8-bit,\n\n82\n00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:14.600\n16-bit architecture that was built\non top of a CPU called an 8086,\n\n83\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.390\nor the 86 processor family, right?\n\n84\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.110\nWell, later on as we progressed,\n32-bit became very, very popular and\n\n85\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.810\nthe instruction set that would\nrun on that family of processors,\n\n86\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.430\nthe DNA if you will, that the processors\nwould run on, was something known as x86.\n\n87\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.490\nAnd x86 meant, going all the way back\nto earlier things, x is like a variable\n\n88\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.512\nif you will, for like the 80_86, and maybe\nyou remember these earlier processors.\n\n89\n00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:41.040\nI don't remember.\n\n90\n00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.700\nThere was a lot.\n\n91\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.490\nIt was in 86 series, essentially.\n\n92\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.834\nSo they said, okay, well,\nwe're gonna say anything that's 32-bit\n\n93\n00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:51.843\nessentially became what's known\nas x86 architecture, right?\n\n94\n00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:53.700\nSo that is 32-bit.\n\n95\n00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.245\nIt gets a little confusing because\nthen when you look at 64-bit, right,\n\n96\n00:04:58.245 --> 00:04:59.350\nyou hear x64.\n\n97\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.710\nWell, what's x64?\n\n98\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.690\nWell, that's actually what Microsoft\nbrands, and since we're talking about\n\n99\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.381\na Windows operating system,\nI'm glad you mentioned it.\n\n100\n00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.960\nX86 in Microsoft land, and\nreally for the rest of the world,\n\n101\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.101\nmeans 32-bit architecture.\n\n102\n00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:14.660\nX64 means 64-bit.\n\n103\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.590\nSo like Dan said,\nif you're making a decision\n\n104\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.040\non what application you\nshould be downloading, right?\n\n105\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.840\nWell, you have to pay attention to\nthe underlying processing architecture.\n\n106\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.566\nNow, the other thing to keep in mind, too,\n\n107\n00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:32.362\nis that the processing architecture\nthat you decide on, the one that you're\n\n108\n00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:37.196\ngonna purchase, is also going to be\na limiting factor on memory, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:38.982\nwell, at lest one will be.\n\n110\n00:05:38.982 --> 00:05:43.146\nX86 architecture is\na 32-bit operating system,\n\n111\n00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:47.770\nwhich means it's 32 binary\none bits side by side, right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.930\nThat is the data path that it'll support.\n\n113\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.770\nYou have to understand that 32-bit\nhas a maximum of 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n114\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.715\nSo if I have 32-bit operating system,\ndoesn't matter how much RAM you try\n\n115\n00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:04.320\nput in that operating system,\nit is only gonna support 4 Gigs.\n\n116\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.620\nUnderstand that 64-bit means you can\nget past that type of limitation.\n\n117\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.680\nThere's a theoretical limitation, I think\nit's 16 exabytes or something like that.\n\n118\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.520\nIt's an astronomical number.\n\n119\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.320\nIt's mind-boggling.\n\n120\n00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.160\nBut we don't have anything\nright now that supports that.\n\n121\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.920\nNow that being said, too,\nyou have to understand that even though,\n\n122\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.310\ntheoretically, the architecture\nmight be unlimited,\n\n123\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.160\nthe operating system is not, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.400\nIt's not unlimited, right?\n\n125\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.800\nUnderstand that in certain additions of\nWindows, you might only be able to see,\n\n126\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.851\nand this is still is mind boggling,\n128 Gigs of RAM, right?\n\n127\n00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:46.189\nAgain, so it really does lend itself to\nwhat operating system are you going to\n\n128\n00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.000\nget, right?\n\n129\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.330\nHow much memory do you need to see?\n\n130\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.879\nNow, in the earlier days, and\nI also wanna take just a second and\n\n131\n00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.680\ntalk briefly about other additions,\nother 64-bits, I guess,\n\n132\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.255\nbrands if you will, naming conventions,\nand that's AMD64, all right?\n\n133\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:07.535\nNow, we've been talking largely about\nIntel, and Intel really paved the way for\n\n134\n00:07:07.535 --> 00:07:10.895\nall micro-processors that\nwould came out later.\n\n135\n00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:13.075\nAnd that's where we get 86 term,\nthe x86 term.\n\n136\n00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:13.975\nBut really,\n\n137\n00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:18.275\nwhen it comes to 64-bit architecture,\nit isn't Intel that we follow.\n\n138\n00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:19.985\nIt's what's known as AMD 64.\n\n139\n00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:22.885\nAMD 64 is actually 64-bit architecture,\nand\n\n140\n00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:26.120\nthat's what you might see\nthings like drivers, right?\n\n141\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.847\nLittle piece of software that allows you\nto communicate with your hardware might\n\n142\n00:07:29.847 --> 00:07:30.790\nbe called AMD64.\n\n143\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.696\nYou might see x64.\n\n144\n00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:36.350\nNow, does that mean Intel\ndidn't have a 64-bit platform?\n\n145\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.140\nYeah, they had a 64-bit platform.\n\n146\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.170\nIt wasn't that great, and it wasn't\nthat popular, and that was IA 64.\n\n147\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, they named it something strange.\n\n148\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Like Intel Architecture, IA-64.\n\n149\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.613\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and people were like\nwhy didn't you just call it x64?\n\n150\n00:07:48.613 --> 00:07:52.710\nYou got x86, and they kind of like\nbehind the 8-Ball on that, right?\n\n151\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n&gt;&gt; AMD cam along and\n\n152\n00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.080\nsaid If you're not gonna,\nI sure as heck will [LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what they did is\nthey also have a work-around for\n\n154\n00:07:59.643 --> 00:08:02.706\nthe instruction set, so\nyou might see well, hey,\n\n155\n00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:07.426\nwe've got this x86 architecture,\nso they also came out with x86-64.\n\n156\n00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:09.702\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is just [CROSSTALK] yeah.\n\n157\n00:08:09.702 --> 00:08:11.030\nExactly, it just throws it off.\n\n158\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.760\nSo understand basically in the,\n\n159\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.650\nsince we're talking about Windows more\nthan anything, what you're gonna see is\n\n160\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:21.574\njust like Dan mentioned in the very first\npoint of this architecture, x86, x64.\n\n161\n00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:24.225\nNow, also remember that\nthat's a memory limitation.\n\n162\n00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:26.540\n32-bits is 4 gigs.\n\n163\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.440\nBeyond that, for 64-bit, you typically\ndon't have to worry to much about\n\n164\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.420\na limitation outside of the hardware,\nalright?\n\n165\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.350\nAll right, so, next thing we\nhave to talk a little bit about,\n\n166\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.490\nwe talked about the versions of\nthe operating system and the additions.\n\n167\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.990\nAnd you might say, well, wait a second,\nWes, didn't you say features and\n\n168\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.810\ninstallation?\n\n169\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.050\nWhat the heck would I worry\nabout versions and additions?\n\n170\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.010\nWell, really tells you what features\nare gonna be available in your\n\n171\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.740\noperating system, and\nthey could ask you on the exam.\n\n172\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.660\nAll right, what I mean by that is if you\nget, typically, if you need a little bit\n\n173\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.994\nmore in depth, understand that we\ndo have our full version of A+, but\n\n174\n00:09:00.994 --> 00:09:03.949\nwhen you get home editions of Windows,\nright?\n\n175\n00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:07.405\nYou don't get business class features,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:08.820\nLet me give you an example.\n\n177\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.970\nIf I get a home edition of Vista,\nand Vista's by the timing\n\n178\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.850\nthat you're probably watching this you're\nsaying, well, I don't have Vista anyway.\n\n179\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:22.570\nBut even in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, if\nyou have the Home-centric editions, right?\n\n180\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.290\nHome Premium and Windows 7, Home Basic.\n\n181\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.360\nYou aren't gonna be able to\nuse something like BitLocker.\n\n182\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.110\nBitLocker's not even included in it,\nright?\n\n183\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.790\nBecause BitLocker is a drive encryption\ntechnology that they say, you know what?\n\n184\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.928\nThat's probably something\na corporate users gonna use, right?\n\n185\n00:09:37.928 --> 00:09:41.470\nThat's something that an enterprise,\nlike for instance,\n\n186\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.010\nthe corporation that Dan used to work for\ndealt with sensitive information, right?\n\n187\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.800\nThey might wanna implement something like\nBitlocker to do drive encryption to make\n\n188\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.470\nsure that the mobile devices that they\nhave, more specifically like the laptops,\n\n189\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.006\nthat maybe have to go out\non site to do a claim,\n\n190\n00:09:57.006 --> 00:09:59.548\nif they get lost,\nif they get stolen, right,\n\n191\n00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:03.290\nthat that information doesn't make it\ninto the wrong unauthorized hands, right?\n\n192\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.610\nSo that's gonna be something that\nyou see in your business additions.\n\n193\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.790\nThe Ultimate additions we\nalso want you to know.\n\n194\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.710\nWhen it comes to those additions,\nthose typically have all the features.\n\n195\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.200\nEvery feature you find\nin the Home editions and\n\n196\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.580\nthe business editions all\nwrapped into one, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.558\nSo please keep that in mind.\n\n198\n00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:26.125\nThe other editions of Windows Vista,\nwell, Windows Vista and\n\n199\n00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.235\nWindows 7, they had the Ultimate editions.\n\n200\n00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:31.065\nAnd then when Windows 8 came out they\nsaid, you know what, there are so\n\n201\n00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:32.505\nmany different editions.\n\n202\n00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:33.665\nThere's Home Basic.\n\n203\n00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:35.855\nNo, actually, let's go the whole list.\n\n204\n00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:39.125\nHome Starter, Home Basic,\nHome Premium, Business, and\n\n205\n00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:42.230\nthen they changed it to\nProfessional in Windows 7.\n\n206\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.790\nEnterprise and Ultimate.\n\n207\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.680\n&gt;&gt; They realized they had too many\nirons in the fire at this point.\n\n208\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.780\n&gt;&gt; I think they did, Dan,\nyeah, good way to put that.\n\n209\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.600\nSo when Windows 8.1, and now even\ntoday with later versions of Windows,\n\n210\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.240\nthey have three editions,\nmake it a lot easier.\n\n211\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.920\nYou have a Home edition, and\nyou have a Professional edition.\n\n212\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.580\nHome edition is for home-centric.\n\n213\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.440\nProfessional edition is for\nyour business environments.\n\n214\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.210\nBut there is a third one, right,\nthat all of them have, and\n\n215\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.198\nthat's called an Enterprise level, right?\n\n216\n00:11:08.198 --> 00:11:12.660\nToday, Windows 8.1 would be Home,\nand they don't even call it home,\n\n217\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.830\nthey call it Windows 8.\n\n218\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.710\nAnd they have Windows 8.1, if you will,\nProfessional, or Pro they call it.\n\n219\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.938\nAnd then they have Windows 8,\nWindows 8.1, Enterprise.\n\n220\n00:11:21.938 --> 00:11:23.860\nThat's also in Vista and Windows 7.\n\n221\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.890\nNow, this is for companies that need\nlots of editions of Windows, right?\n\n222\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.110\nI believe the volume license agreement\nwith Microsoft is 250 editions, or\n\n223\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.680\nlicense and above, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.050\nWell, when you have that bulk of operating\nsystems that you need to purchase,\n\n225\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.170\nat a certain point they realize that\nthat's a lot of money to buy individual\n\n226\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.550\nWindows operating systems.\n\n227\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.250\nSo they allow you to enter into\nan Enterprise level contract, right?\n\n228\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.480\nSo what does Enterprise features have?\n\n229\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.690\nEverything that the Ultimate editions do.\n\n230\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.370\nThink of it today is that an Ultimate\nedition is kind of like your Enterprise.\n\n231\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.730\nIt gives you all of those\nbusiness class features.\n\n232\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.210\nThings like applocker, being able to\ncontrol applications that users can\n\n233\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.690\nexecute on their machines, right?\n\n234\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.500\nIn a home environment,\nif you need that kind of functionality,\n\n235\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.570\nyou use parental controls.\n\n236\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.580\nParental controls is not something\nyou're probably gonna set up inside of\n\n237\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.440\na corporate environment.\n\n238\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.180\nBut an admin like Dan would\nwanna be able to push out\n\n239\n00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.480\na setting across the entire\nnetwork that says, no,\n\n240\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.440\nyou're not gonna use that unlicensed,\nunauthorized piece of software.\n\n241\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.580\nI'm locking it down.\n\n242\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.000\nYou're gonna use what we paid for so\n\n243\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.250\nthat we don't have some kind\nof license violation, right?\n\n244\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.200\nAgain, to kind of give you an example.\n\n245\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.430\nSo I do want you to be aware of that.\n\n246\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.960\nNext thing you have to worry about are\nthings like, they call them upgrade paths.\n\n247\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.040\nWhat is an upgrade?\n\n248\n00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.115\nWell, we got a couple of\ndifferent types of upgrades here.\n\n249\n00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:43.880\nWe've got what's known as a,\nwell, let's go ahead and\n\n250\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.970\ntalk about what an upgrade is in general,\nall right?\n\n251\n00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.660\nAn upgrade is when I take\nan older operating system,\n\n252\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.120\nolder version of Windows, and I upgrade it\nto a newer version of Windows, all right?\n\n253\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.560\nAnd there are certain upgrade\npaths that you have to follow.\n\n254\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.570\nCertain operating systems can be\nupgraded to certain editions of Windows.\n\n255\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.236\nCertain, I should say not\noperating systems, but\n\n256\n00:13:03.236 --> 00:13:07.520\ncertain editions of Windows can only be\nupgraded to certain editions of Windows.\n\n257\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.780\nAnd let me show you what I mean here, make\nit a little bit less confusing, right?\n\n258\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.950\nSo in upgrade paths right here,\nwe've got Vista with service pack one and\n\n259\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.580\nservice pack two, right?\n\n260\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.340\nHome Basic can upgrade to\nHome Basic Premium or Ultimate.\n\n261\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.700\nNotice here, and you guys can again,\nin the accelerated edition\n\n262\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.030\nyou might have to pause this to\nkinda memorize this information.\n\n263\n00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.220\nWe want you to memorize the information.\n\n264\n00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.227\nBut notice one thing that\nisn't in this list, right?\n\n265\n00:13:32.227 --> 00:13:37.250\nNotice that I can't take Home Basic and\nupgrade it to Professional Windows 7.\n\n266\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.060\nIt's not allowed, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.310\nYou want those features,\nyou want professional features,\n\n268\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.830\nyou gotta go all the way up to Ultimate.\n\n269\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.060\nThat's just the way\nthe upgrade path works.\n\n270\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.220\nNotice when I have Business.\n\n271\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.730\nBusiness already has in Vista\na lot of extra features\n\n272\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.420\nthat the Home Premium editions didn't.\n\n273\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.089\nSo I can't do a downgrade, right?\n\n274\n00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:59.268\nI can't go from business to Home Basic,\nright?\n\n275\n00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:00.210\nYou just can't do that.\n\n276\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.250\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't make sense to.\n\n277\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.184\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't, right?\n\n278\n00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:04.040\nSo there are upgrade paths.\n\n279\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.950\nEnterprise requires\na volume license agreement.\n\n280\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.090\nEnterprise to Enterprise, right?\n\n281\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.600\nThat's part of something that\nthey call software assurance.\n\n282\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.620\nAnd this is actually a pretty\ngood thing with Microsoft, right?\n\n283\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.295\nLet's say you go to Microsoft,\n\n284\n00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:19.498\nyou say here's a $10,000 check for\nour additions of Windows that we need.\n\n285\n00:14:19.498 --> 00:14:21.920\nThey say okay,\nhere's your operating systems.\n\n286\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.460\nAnd six months later they come out\nwith a new version of Windows.\n\n287\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.330\nYou'd probably feel left out, right?\n\n288\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.390\nYou'd probably feel a little irritated by\nthe fact that you just dropped a big old\n\n289\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.750\ncheck like that, or maybe even more,\nif you've got thousands of computers,\n\n290\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.430\nand now there's a new\noperating system out.\n\n291\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.270\nWell, guess what?\n\n292\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.460\nSoftware assurance says, hey, if we\ncome out with a new product, guess what?\n\n293\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.810\nThat license rolls over to\nthe new edition of Windows.\n\n294\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.400\nAnd that's why Enterprise to Enterprise,\nthat's the way that works.\n\n295\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.730\nUltimate to Ultimate as well.\n\n296\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.210\nSo we can look here,\nif we can see Ultimate to Ultimate.\n\n297\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.131\nAnd look at all the different editions.\n\n298\n00:14:54.131 --> 00:14:56.646\nThat's why it was great\nwhen we see Windows 8.\n\n299\n00:14:56.646 --> 00:15:00.280\nNow you can also do, within Windows 7,\nyou can do it's upgrades.\n\n300\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.180\nLet's say I started out\nwith the Starter Package.\n\n301\n00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.965\nWell, that's redundant,\nstarted out with Starter.\n\n302\n00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:07.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can upgrade to the next level up,\n\n303\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.100\nHome Premium, Professional,\nand Ultimate, right?\n\n304\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.850\nYou look here, I can go from Professional.\n\n305\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.530\nNow, and you guys, again, take a second\nif you need to, and stop the video, and\n\n306\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.610\nyou can kinda write these down, right?\n\n307\n00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.390\nBut notice that I'm always stepping up.\n\n308\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.700\nYou're not stepping back, all right?.\n\n309\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.730\nHome Premium, I can go to Professional.\n\n310\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.210\nI can go a step up, right?\n\n311\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.350\nCuz I've already got Windows 7.\n\n312\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not really an upgrade if you're\nstaying either in the same level,\n\n313\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.560\nor going the other way.\n\n314\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.350\nThat's not an upgrade.\n\n315\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.119\nWe're going up to the next\nthing that's better, right?\n\n316\n00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good point.\n\n317\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.144\nAnd I would say, and\nI didn't even think about that,\n\n318\n00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:45.295\nthat's probably a good way\nto remember it for the exam.\n\n319\n00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:49.260\nSo a little exam tip you got from Dan, and\nI wasn't even thinking about that, great.\n\n320\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.499\nUpgrade always ups\nwhatever the features are.\n\n321\n00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:54.364\nNotice that I can go from professional.\n\n322\n00:15:54.364 --> 00:15:57.210\nLet's say I got a pro machine.\n\n323\n00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.620\nBut I want some of the extra features\nthat Ultimate would give me.\n\n324\n00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.960\nSo, well, now I want that.\n\n325\n00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.270\nWell, you could upgrade to Ultimate.\n\n326\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.240\nNow, when we start getting in\nWindows 7 and Windows 8, I love it.\n\n327\n00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.949\nBoy, this list just gets littler and\nlittler, right?\n\n328\n00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:12.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice that we have Windows 8 and\n\n329\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.350\nWindows 8 Pro.\n\n330\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.750\nAnything lower can go to Windows 8 and\nWindows Pro, right?\n\n331\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.840\nif we look at Professional,\nProfessional can go to Windows 8 Pro.\n\n332\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.687\nWindows 7 Ultimate can go\nto Windows 8 Pro, right?\n\n333\n00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:29.280\nCuz that's the only three things\nthat they have in Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n334\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.007\nMake it easy.\n\n335\n00:16:30.007 --> 00:16:33.383\nAnd you're gonna see, I could also\ndo the same thing for Windows 8.1.\n\n336\n00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:35.962\nAgain, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n337\n00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.145\nThey have just Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.\n\n338\n00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:42.562\nThey have Windows 8 or 8.1 Pro.\n\n339\n00:16:42.562 --> 00:16:44.798\nAnd then Windows 8 or 8.1 Enterprise.\n\n340\n00:16:44.798 --> 00:16:47.450\nNotice Enterprise isn't in the list?\n\n341\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.490\nIt's Enterprise to Enterprise.\n\n342\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.641\nThat's all, you can always\nremember that one, all right?\n\n343\n00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:54.065\nOther things.\n\n344\n00:16:54.065 --> 00:16:56.880\nI wanna go from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.\n\n345\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.230\nAgain, architecture to architecture.\n\n346\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.710\nUpgrade, I really like that.\n\n347\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.653\nI'm gonna steal that, right?\n\n348\n00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even if the camera says\n\n349\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.961\nyou said it first, I'm stealing it.\n\n350\n00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:07.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a Wes Bryant original.\n\n351\n00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:08.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n352\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.220\nSo notice,\nwe have Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.\n\n353\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.820\nWindows 8 to Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\n354\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.550\nYou can always see that it's stepping up.\n\n355\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.120\nThere was a Media Center for a little bit,\nWindows 8 Pro with Media Center,\n\n356\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.460\nbut I didn't really agree with this one.\n\n357\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.460\nI kinda liked Media Center, but\nthey stripped Media Center out of it.\n\n358\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.390\nAnd the reason they did\nthat is because they said,\n\n359\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.490\nwell, a lot of people are using\nother third-party type software.\n\n360\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:33.670\nMedia Center basically\nallows you to stream TV,\n\n361\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.740\nif you will, and videos and\nstuff to your computer as well.\n\n362\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.507\nWe've got so many different\nproducts today that do that.\n\n363\n00:17:40.507 --> 00:17:42.801\nThe were like, well, a lot of people\nare going with a third party, so\n\n364\n00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:44.316\nwe'll go ahead and\njust take it out of there.\n\n365\n00:17:44.316 --> 00:17:48.720\nAll right, Windows 8.1,\nthat's a small list.\n\n366\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.207\nYou got Windows 8.1,\nit can go to Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\n367\n00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:54.895\n&gt;&gt; I think I can remember that one, Wes.\n\n368\n00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:56.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a tough one, bud.\n\n369\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.009\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] right?\n\n371\n00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:02.370\nSome special considerations that I\nwant you to keep in mind, all right?\n\n372\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.000\nWe don't do cross architecture, all right?\n\n373\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.920\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n374\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.370\nAnd that could be, exam alert, I can see\nthat kinda being an exam alert, right?\n\n375\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.610\nThese are few little facts that if you\ncan get them under your belt it will\n\n376\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.850\naccelerate your training,\naccelerate what you your productivity and\n\n377\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.426\nyour success on the exam, right?\n\n378\n00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:23.665\nNo cross architecture upgrades, right?\n\n379\n00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:25.704\nCan't go 32 bit, 64.\n\n380\n00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.421\nCan't go 64 to 32 bit.\n\n381\n00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:29.080\nDoesn't work that way.\n\n382\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.720\nThe other thing is Cross Language, right?\n\n383\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.480\nSo you'll see that with\nyour installation media,\n\n384\n00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.960\na lot of times it will have the two\nletter country code in front of it.\n\n385\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.460\nFor instance, here in the States here, and\n\n386\n00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.110\nI'm sure you've seen the ISOs for\nWindows there, Dan.\n\n387\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.180\nOurs usually say EN_ and then whatever the\nWindows operating system is after that.\n\n388\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.850\nJust lets us know that it's English,\nright?\n\n389\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.320\nSo, for instance, they've got the Korean\nversion and its KN_ and they've got Japan,\n\n390\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.040\nI think it's JP, isn't it?\n\n391\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.610\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n392\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.750\n&gt;&gt; JP or JN, something like that.\n\n393\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.470\n&gt;&gt; I think it's JP.\n\n394\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.400\n&gt;&gt; JP, yeah, and it's underscore, right?\n\n395\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.520\nSo you can't do cross language.\n\n396\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.100\nThat's not supported.\n\n397\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.210\nThe only one, VL editions-\n&gt;&gt; Very large editions, right?\n\n398\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.450\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n399\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.032\n&gt;&gt; Very large editions, that's right.\n\n400\n00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:10.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:11.244\n&gt;&gt; It is about,\n\n402\n00:19:11.244 --> 00:19:13.060\nthe ISOs are up about three?\n\n403\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.175\nWell, they're pretty big, so\nit is a very large edition.\n\n404\n00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:17.510\nThat's your volume license editions,\nright?\n\n405\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.590\nYou can do upgrades between\nvolume license editions, and\n\n406\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.530\nthat’s one of the ones,\nit just makes it easy to remember.\n\n407\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.930\nYou have Enterprise, the only thing\nyou’re upgrading to is Enterprise, and\n\n408\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.650\nnothing in between.\n\n409\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.394\nAnd so it makes it easier so you don't\nhave to remember all these different\n\n410\n00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:33.590\neditions, which is one of the great\nthings I like about the new model.\n\n411\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.120\nThree different editions\nof that version of Windows.\n\n412\n00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stop killing us with all these\n7,000 different editions of Windows.\n\n413\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.370\nWe get it, it’s Windows.\n\n414\n00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Make one for the Home, make one for\n\n415\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.650\nthe Enterprise level, and\nmake some for Professional.\n\n416\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.710\nIt's that simple.\n\n417\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n418\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.250\nNow, some of the other things\nthat they talk with upgrades.\n\n419\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.650\nI went ahead and put in the same list as,\nthese are the upgrades and\n\n420\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.580\nthe upgrade paths.\n\n421\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.890\nLike knowing what an upgrade is, right?\n\n422\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.220\nI will tell you,\n\n423\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.960\none last thing that I wanna mention is\nthat there are upgrades that are in-place\n\n424\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.610\nupgrades, and they're what are known as\nclean installation upgrades, all right?\n\n425\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.650\nLet me tell you what I mean by that.\n\n426\n00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:14.940\nLet's say that you wanna upgrade\nto edition that doesn't support\n\n427\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.310\nan in-place upgrade, which means I\ntake the older operating system,\n\n428\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.000\nolder version of Windows,\nand I wanna do that upgrade.\n\n429\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.870\nI wanna upgrade by putting the newer\nversion of Windows on top of it.\n\n430\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.740\nIf that's supported,\nthat's called an in-place upgrade, right?\n\n431\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.590\nCuz your old operating system is still in\nplace when you upgrade the old one, right?\n\n432\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.030\nI'm gonna give you\na classic example of that.\n\n433\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.794\nYou have Windows 8.\n\n434\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.947\nYou wanted to go to Windows 8.1 Pro?\n\n435\n00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:38.860\nIn-place upgrade.\n\n436\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.710\nSlap it right over the top.\n\n437\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.470\n&gt;&gt; So you take your box, you slap\nthe disc in, you run the installer or\n\n438\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.810\nthe upgrade little wizard,\nyou walk through it, next thing you know,\n\n439\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.380\nyou reboot the box, your on 8.1 from 8.0.\n\n440\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n441\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.750\nNow, there's also what's known as\nkind of like a wipe and load..\n\n442\n00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.710\nAnd that is an upgrade that\nrequires a clean installation.\n\n443\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.470\nI go to Microsoft, because when you pay\nfor an upgrade license, they say, well,\n\n444\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.940\nyou already have Windows, technically,\nyou really didn't to upgrade.\n\n445\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.130\nSo, we'll give you a deal,\nwe'll encourage you to upgrade.\n\n446\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:09.940\nYou'll pay less for\n\n447\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.260\nthe operating system than buying it brand\nnew if you never had the operating system.\n\n448\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.750\nThat's, some people are like,\nwell, why don't I just go out and\n\n449\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.930\nbuy the operating system?\n\n450\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.140\nWhy would I upgrade at all?\n\n451\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.280\nBecause you typically get almost\n$100 dollars off per edition.\n\n452\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.640\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty good savings.\n\n453\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n454\n00:21:23.295 --> 00:21:25.360\nSo that's why I mention that,\nand that's why they have it.\n\n455\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.569\nThey make it worth your while,\nif you will,\n\n456\n00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:29.619\nto upgrade to the new operating system.\n\n457\n00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:33.168\nBut if it's not supported,\na direct in-place upgrade,\n\n458\n00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:35.422\nyou have to do a clean installation.\n\n459\n00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:38.558\nWhich you go to Microsoft,\nyou pay them for the Operating System,\n\n460\n00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:42.422\nyou pay maybe the discount, if you will,\nand you have to format your hard drive and\n\n461\n00:21:42.422 --> 00:21:45.330\nyou install the new operating\nsystem on top of it.\n\n462\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.400\nAll of these upgrades require\na previous licensed version of Windows.\n\n463\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.171\nDon't think you're gonna\nbe able to get the turn and\n\n464\n00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:56.520\nburn cracked version of Windows, and\nthat this is gonna allow you to upgrade.\n\n465\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.990\nSo please keep that in mind, too.\n\n466\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.085\n&gt;&gt; This is what I love about Linux.\n\n467\n00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:01.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about this stuff.\n\n468\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n469\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.980\nthat's a good point, right?\n\n470\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.630\nIn other operating systems,\nwe talk about closed source and\n\n471\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.660\nproprietary versus open source.\n\n472\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.920\nMicrosoft has Windows under a closed\nsource proprietary implementation.\n\n473\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.900\nAll right, so upgrades.\n\n474\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.390\nOne of the last things I want to talk\nabout when it comes to upgrades,\n\n475\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.235\nthen we'll mention just a few of\nthe features that you need to be aware of,\n\n476\n00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:24.310\nall right, are these two upgrade\nutilities that we have right here.\n\n477\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.758\nWe have what is known as Easy Transfer,\n\n478\n00:22:26.758 --> 00:22:30.200\nwe have what's known as\na User State Migration Tool.\n\n479\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.720\nSo if we could take a look at here,\nyou can see Easy Transfer,\n\n480\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.150\nWindow's Easy Transfer is inside of,\nwell, Windows.\n\n481\n00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.557\nAnd in fact, let me go ahead and\nget into my Windows 8.\n\n482\n00:22:39.557 --> 00:22:41.540\nActually, let's go to Windows 7.\n\n483\n00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.682\nAnd I'll tell you why I'm\ngoing to Windows 7 and\n\n484\n00:22:43.682 --> 00:22:45.522\nI didn't go to Windows 8 here, in a sec.\n\n485\n00:22:45.522 --> 00:22:46.960\nAnd you'll see, it's actually in the list.\n\n486\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.720\nI think I can just type easy.\n\n487\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.412\nAll right, yeah, well,\nthat makes it easy, right?\n\n488\n00:22:50.412 --> 00:22:52.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n489\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.710\nAll right, Windows Easy Transfer is\ncalled Easy Transfer for a reason.\n\n490\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.670\nIt's a really quick wizard\ndriven easy breezy way to\n\n491\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.110\ntake your data, migrate it, and\ntransfer it over to the new\n\n492\n00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.530\noperating system when you decide\nto do the upgrade, right?\n\n493\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.570\n&gt;&gt; Now hold up there, Wes.\n\n494\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.950\nIsn't there also some something\ncalled the User State Migration Tool?\n\n495\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Scary.\n\n496\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Scary.\n\n497\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.610\nYou gotta watch that one, right?\n\n498\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.470\nBecause this is GUI drive, wizard based,\nand even Wes can handle the word Next.\n\n499\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.660\nBut what I can´t do is\ntype to save my life.\n\n500\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, you gotta be careful\n\n501\n00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.350\nwith the next one.\n\n502\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.790\nAnd the next one, if we look back\nhere at my slide, is the USMT,\n\n503\n00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.560\nthe User State Migration Tool.\n\n504\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.060\nAnd with that USMT it´s\na little bit different, right?\n\n505\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.380\nSee, the Easy Transfer is you can see\nsome of the things that we talked about.\n\n506\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.550\nSmall deployments.\n\n507\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.060\nMicrosoft really recommends\nno more than five computers.\n\n508\n00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.892\nYou do have cable, too.\n\n509\n00:23:39.892 --> 00:23:42.780\nThey had an Easy Transfer cable\nthat you can plug between machines.\n\n510\n00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.660\n&gt;&gt; I remember that.\n&gt;&gt; And it would\n\n511\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.090\ndo it automatically for you.\n\n512\n00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.624\nSo again, they try to make it easy.\n\n513\n00:23:46.624 --> 00:23:49.365\nAgain, it's It's wizard driven.\n\n514\n00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:51.411\nNow one of the reasons\nI didn't go to 8.1 for\n\n515\n00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:53.679\nit is because it's deprecated\nin later versions.\n\n516\n00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:56.470\nWhen they came out with something\nknown as file history, they said hey,\n\n517\n00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.942\nif you're gonna back up your information,\nuse file history and\n\n518\n00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:00.520\nback it up to an external drive.\n\n519\n00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.460\nThen if you need to upgrade,\n\n520\n00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.860\nyou can pull that information\nfrom file history back down.\n\n521\n00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.822\nUser State Migration, like I said, this\ntool,I'm just gonna say, whoa now, whoa.\n\n522\n00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:12.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slow the horses right, it's because it\n\n523\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.525\nis command line driven and it is there for\nmajor deployments, large deployments.\n\n524\n00:24:17.525 --> 00:24:21.169\nIt can do 500,000 computers,\nit's script based and\n\n525\n00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:25.821\nit is XML based right, it's in the command\nline, so you have to know syntax.\n\n526\n00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:29.347\nAnd when I say command line, we're gonna\ntalk about command line in another\n\n527\n00:24:29.347 --> 00:24:31.883\nepisode, but\nwe're talking about the command prompt\n\n528\n00:24:31.883 --> 00:24:35.483\nentering into text based commands, and\nyou have to know what you're doing.\n\n529\n00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:36.960\nIt has two utilities.\n\n530\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.690\nIt has what's known as scanstate.exe and\nloadstate.exe.\n\n531\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.810\nOn the computer that you wanna take and\nmigrate the information on,\n\n532\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.200\nyou run scanstate.\n\n533\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.360\nThat's what grabs that information.\n\n534\n00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.330\nThen you take that information from the\nlocation that you saved it to and after\n\n535\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.996\nyou do the upgrade, or if you're upgrading\nit to a completely different machine,\n\n536\n00:24:54.996 --> 00:24:57.940\nyou'll run loadstate and\nthat loads all of those settings.\n\n537\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.490\nAgain that's what's known as a migration,\nall right so no USMT.\n\n538\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.090\nAll right, now, last few things that\nwe wanna say in this, and I know we're\n\n539\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.930\ndefinitely gonna go into a part two, we'll\ntake care of the installation coming up,\n\n540\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.580\nis that I just want to kinda move through\na couple of the features that you have\n\n541\n00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.040\ninside of your Window's operating system.\n\n542\n00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.580\nOne of the things that they call\nout is the Arrow Interface.\n\n543\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.150\nThe Arrow Interface is in Windows 7.\n\n544\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.360\nNow it's not in Windows 8.\n\n545\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.472\nIt's not in Windows 10.\n\n546\n00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:24.744\nActually it was in Windows-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Vista.\n\n547\n00:25:24.744 --> 00:25:26.291\n&gt;&gt; As well too, that's right.\n\n548\n00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.563\nIt's in Windows Vista and\nit's in Windows 7.\n\n549\n00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:33.347\nIt was a nice visually rich interface I\nremember, I think is how Microsoft used\n\n550\n00:25:33.347 --> 00:25:38.205\nthe branding was in my Microsoft training,\nis that it allows translucencies,\n\n551\n00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:41.560\nin fact let me show you some\nof the Arrow features here.\n\n552\n00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.220\nIf I opened up a window here,\nit allows you to do snap like that,\n\n553\n00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.120\nthe snap feature.\n\n554\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.480\nI can drag things to the side, right?\n\n555\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.530\nI can drag things to the other side and\nit snaps side by side, so it's got\n\n556\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.090\na lot of productivity features, but again\nit's more of a visually rich interface.\n\n557\n00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.440\nDoes require some extra resources.\n\n558\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.192\nBy today's standards, these aren't really\ntoo bad, but in the days that it came out\n\n559\n00:26:04.192 --> 00:26:07.690\nit did require certain bit of\nvideo graphics memory and stuff,\n\n560\n00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.861\nnot something that you really\nhave to worry about today.\n\n561\n00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.850\nNow you also have what\nare known as gadgets.\n\n562\n00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.270\nIf you right-click on the desktop,\nyou can see gadgets here.\n\n563\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.510\nGadgets are are great because these\nare like little mini applications.\n\n564\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.700\nNow in the days of Vista,\n\n565\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.960\nthe applications were actually docked to\nsomething known as the sidebar over here.\n\n566\n00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.240\nThat sidebar also took\nup additional resources.\n\n567\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.120\nIn Windows 7, they said you know what?\n\n568\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.100\nIf you can take, and you can move these.\n\n569\n00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.050\nOops, let me just close that down.\n\n570\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.460\nIf you can take these gadgets,\nand what you can do is,\n\n571\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.420\nyou can move them out of the side bar,\nif you didn't want them docked there, and\n\n572\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.480\nyou can move them all around.\n\n573\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.100\nSo, they said, you know what?\n\n574\n00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.070\nSince, you can already take them and\nmove them around anyways,\n\n575\n00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.120\nwhat's the point of the side bar,\nso they got rid of it.\n\n576\n00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why the side bar isn't\n\n577\n00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:55.753\nhere in Windows 7.\n\n578\n00:26:55.753 --> 00:26:59.198\nAnd I will tell you that gadgets\nhave been completely done\n\n579\n00:26:59.198 --> 00:27:02.297\naway with inside of Windows 8 and\nWindows 8.1.\n\n580\n00:27:02.297 --> 00:27:04.963\nThere were some security\nvulnerabilities but,\n\n581\n00:27:04.963 --> 00:27:08.156\nin Windows 7 you do have these\nmany apps known as gadgets.\n\n582\n00:27:08.156 --> 00:27:11.680\nNow Vista also introduced something\nknown as the User Account Control.\n\n583\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.530\nThis is something known as\nthe Standard Users Security Architecture.\n\n584\n00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.830\nIt is something that we do have today, and\n\n585\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.576\nit is something that you\nhave to be aware of.\n\n586\n00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:22.050\nWhen we talk about\nStandard User Security Architecture,\n\n587\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.600\nwe're actually talking about something\nthat only allows an administrator,\n\n588\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.700\nto make modifications to your registry,\ninstall software and\n\n589\n00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.500\nto configure key security settings, right?\n\n590\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.570\nI can show you here real quick,\nif I go to the Start button.\n\n591\n00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.900\nGo to Control Panel.\n\n592\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.630\nYou'll notice that there\nare User Accounts.\n\n593\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.890\nThen we'll go to User Accounts again, and\n\n594\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.790\nyou'll notice that we can manage our user\naccount settings, right here, all right?\n\n595\n00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.510\nIt depends on how strict you want it.\n\n596\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.718\nDepends on where you move the slider bar,\nI would say that on your exam you wanna\n\n597\n00:27:55.718 --> 00:27:58.420\npay attention to what these\ndifferent settings do.\n\n598\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.287\nNow that being said, man, I'm looking\ndown our list and it does look like\n\n599\n00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:03.890\nwe're running out of time,\nwe got a few more things to talk about.\n\n600\n00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.305\nSo, how about this?\n\n601\n00:28:05.305 --> 00:28:06.795\nWe'll go ahead, we'll go into a part two.\n\n602\n00:28:06.795 --> 00:28:09.738\nAnd what I was thinking about,\nis we can finish through the features, and\n\n603\n00:28:09.738 --> 00:28:12.019\nwe can run through some\ninstallation basics, because,\n\n604\n00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:14.345\nwell, I don't think we're\ngonna fit it in this one.\n\n605\n00:28:14.345 -->
