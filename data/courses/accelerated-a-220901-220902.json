00:00:08.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:12.053\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.053\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:16.748\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:20.808\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're actually starting\n\n7\n00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:24.579\noff our accelerated A+ course,\nkinda taking the best of 902 and 901,\n\n8\n00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.537\nslamming them together, and\ngiving you just what you need so\n\n9\n00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:31.180\nthat you can get into that exam booth and\npass it as soon as possible.\n\n10\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.690\nThis does assume some knowledge, of\ncourse, because, well, we're accelerated.\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.280\nWe 're hoping that you've\nsome basic foundational\n\n12\n00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.890\nknowledge already underneath your belt.\n\n13\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.160\nIf so,\nthis is definitely the course for you.\n\n14\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.637\nJoining us to help steer this ship,\nto help get you to where you need to be,\n\n15\n00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:48.170\nwhich is A+ certified,\nour good friend and mentor, Mr Wes Brian.\n\n16\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.566\nWes, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n17\n00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.150\nHow's it going today?\n\n18\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.800\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n19\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.980\nGreat to dive in to this acceleration or\naccelerated show, like Dan says.\n\n20\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.774\nAnd that's right, we're gonna be\nlooking at our operating system today.\n\n21\n00:00:57.774 --> 00:00:59.570\nAnd let's say our operating system.\n\n22\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.490\nLet's go ahead and be a little bit more\nspecific than that cuz there is a few of\n\n23\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.890\nthem out there, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.120\nMore specifically, we're gonna be looking\nat the Windows operating system and\n\n25\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.530\nsome of the things that you should know\nwhen it comes making a choice, well,\n\n26\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.900\nwhich Windows edition do I get inside\nof my computer, which one should I get,\n\n27\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.946\nas well as some of the features\nthat are available.\n\n28\n00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:22.170\nAnd then finally, what we're gonna look at\nis a little bit about the installation of\n\n29\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.180\nthe operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.830\nNow, one of the first things that we're\ngonna start out by, if you're gonna talk\n\n31\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.000\nabout Windows in general, is just,\nwell, what basically is Windows, right?\n\n32\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.210\nWell, the Windows Operating System,\nbasically,\n\n33\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.810\nlike any other operating system,\nit allows you to control your hardware.\n\n34\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.110\nThe Windows Operating System is gonna\nbe a good majority of your A+ exam.\n\n35\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.990\nAnd one of the reasons that is, is because\nhistorically, it's had pretty much\n\n36\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.380\nthe majority of the Enterprise market when\nit comes to PC in general, computers.\n\n37\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.500\nNow, you'll notice that in other episodes\nwe do talk about the Mac operating system,\n\n38\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.290\nwe talk about the Linux operating system.\n\n39\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.889\nSo understand that I'm not saying\none is better than the other.\n\n40\n00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.040\nThey all have their goods and sometimes\nthey all have their drawbacks at times.\n\n41\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.180\nBut an operating system essentially\nis an operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.450\nIt allows you access to the hardware.\n\n43\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.534\nNow, Windows, one of the things\nthat kinda made Windows really,\n\n44\n00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.848\nreally famous is they\nkinda revolutionized, and\n\n45\n00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:22.924\nthey certainly weren't the first to invent\nit, but they definitely revolutionized,\n\n46\n00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:26.028\nit was a Graphical User Interface and\nPoint and Click technology.\n\n47\n00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:28.907\nLike I said, if you do a little\nbit of historical research,\n\n48\n00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:32.363\nwhich really isn't gonna benefit you\non the exam, is the fact that they\n\n49\n00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:35.900\nweren't the first ones to do\nthe Graphical User Interface by any means.\n\n50\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.450\nBut again, it became very,\nvery common in the Enterprise market due\n\n51\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.240\nto things like the tenacity of\nBill Gates and marketing, if you will.\n\n52\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.580\nNow, that being said, if you are gonna\ninstall a Windows operating system,\n\n53\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.790\none of the first things that you need to\nknow about your operating system is what\n\n54\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.270\narchitecture are you going to use,\nall right?\n\n55\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.620\nWhen we talk about the architecture\nthat you're gonna use,\n\n56\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.810\nwell, there are two different\ntypes of architecture.\n\n57\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.620\nActually, it's really three\ntypes of architectures.\n\n58\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.440\nBut I will go ahead,\n\n59\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250\nI'll mention only two that I really\nthink that you have to worry about.\n\n60\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.970\nWe have what's known as\n32-bit architecture.\n\n61\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.510\nYou have what's known\nas 64-bit architecture.\n\n62\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.420\nNow, the third one is actually\nsomething called ARM architecture,\n\n63\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.030\nthat's the Advanced Risk Machine,\nthat's more for mobile devices.\n\n64\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.130\nAnd we do have later additions of Windows,\nas late as Windows 10.\n\n65\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.550\nDon't worry about that for the exam.\n\n66\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.660\nBut at the time of the recording,\n\n67\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.190\nI just mention it because\nit it a ARM-based solution.\n\n68\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.850\nHowever-\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, Wes, this is,\n\n69\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.980\nwhen you say architecture,\nthis is when I look at maybe a download or\n\n70\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.930\nsomething it says 32-bit or\n64-bit, or x86 or x86_64, right?\n\n71\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.630\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great question because\nthat's where it gets confusing, right?\n\n72\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.709\nAll those numbers.\n\n73\n00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.256\nWhy couldn't they just stick with one,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:49.501\n&gt;&gt; I don't know [LAUGH].\n\n75\n00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:50.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, what is x86?\n\n76\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.760\nWhat does that mean?\n\n77\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.530\nWell, when you first start out, well,\nwhen computers first started out,\n\n78\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.880\nit was basically led by Intel, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.360\nOne of the most major microprocessing,\nand today we just call the processor CPU.\n\n80\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.710\nProcessor companies in the world.\n\n81\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.736\nWell, when they started out,\nthey started out with really an 8-bit,\n\n82\n00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:14.600\n16-bit architecture that was built\non top of a CPU called an 8086,\n\n83\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.390\nor the 86 processor family, right?\n\n84\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.110\nWell, later on as we progressed,\n32-bit became very, very popular and\n\n85\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.810\nthe instruction set that would\nrun on that family of processors,\n\n86\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.430\nthe DNA if you will, that the processors\nwould run on, was something known as x86.\n\n87\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.490\nAnd x86 meant, going all the way back\nto earlier things, x is like a variable\n\n88\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.512\nif you will, for like the 80_86, and maybe\nyou remember these earlier processors.\n\n89\n00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:41.040\nI don't remember.\n\n90\n00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.700\nThere was a lot.\n\n91\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.490\nIt was in 86 series, essentially.\n\n92\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.834\nSo they said, okay, well,\nwe're gonna say anything that's 32-bit\n\n93\n00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:51.843\nessentially became what's known\nas x86 architecture, right?\n\n94\n00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:53.700\nSo that is 32-bit.\n\n95\n00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.245\nIt gets a little confusing because\nthen when you look at 64-bit, right,\n\n96\n00:04:58.245 --> 00:04:59.350\nyou hear x64.\n\n97\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.710\nWell, what's x64?\n\n98\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.690\nWell, that's actually what Microsoft\nbrands, and since we're talking about\n\n99\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.381\na Windows operating system,\nI'm glad you mentioned it.\n\n100\n00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.960\nX86 in Microsoft land, and\nreally for the rest of the world,\n\n101\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.101\nmeans 32-bit architecture.\n\n102\n00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:14.660\nX64 means 64-bit.\n\n103\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.590\nSo like Dan said,\nif you're making a decision\n\n104\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.040\non what application you\nshould be downloading, right?\n\n105\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.840\nWell, you have to pay attention to\nthe underlying processing architecture.\n\n106\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.566\nNow, the other thing to keep in mind, too,\n\n107\n00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:32.362\nis that the processing architecture\nthat you decide on, the one that you're\n\n108\n00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:37.196\ngonna purchase, is also going to be\na limiting factor on memory, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:38.982\nwell, at lest one will be.\n\n110\n00:05:38.982 --> 00:05:43.146\nX86 architecture is\na 32-bit operating system,\n\n111\n00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:47.770\nwhich means it's 32 binary\none bits side by side, right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.930\nThat is the data path that it'll support.\n\n113\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.770\nYou have to understand that 32-bit\nhas a maximum of 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n114\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.715\nSo if I have 32-bit operating system,\ndoesn't matter how much RAM you try\n\n115\n00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:04.320\nput in that operating system,\nit is only gonna support 4 Gigs.\n\n116\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.620\nUnderstand that 64-bit means you can\nget past that type of limitation.\n\n117\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.680\nThere's a theoretical limitation, I think\nit's 16 exabytes or something like that.\n\n118\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.520\nIt's an astronomical number.\n\n119\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.320\nIt's mind-boggling.\n\n120\n00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.160\nBut we don't have anything\nright now that supports that.\n\n121\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.920\nNow that being said, too,\nyou have to understand that even though,\n\n122\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.310\ntheoretically, the architecture\nmight be unlimited,\n\n123\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.160\nthe operating system is not, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.400\nIt's not unlimited, right?\n\n125\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.800\nUnderstand that in certain additions of\nWindows, you might only be able to see,\n\n126\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.851\nand this is still is mind boggling,\n128 Gigs of RAM, right?\n\n127\n00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:46.189\nAgain, so it really does lend itself to\nwhat operating system are you going to\n\n128\n00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.000\nget, right?\n\n129\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.330\nHow much memory do you need to see?\n\n130\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.879\nNow, in the earlier days, and\nI also wanna take just a second and\n\n131\n00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.680\ntalk briefly about other additions,\nother 64-bits, I guess,\n\n132\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.255\nbrands if you will, naming conventions,\nand that's AMD64, all right?\n\n133\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:07.535\nNow, we've been talking largely about\nIntel, and Intel really paved the way for\n\n134\n00:07:07.535 --> 00:07:10.895\nall micro-processors that\nwould came out later.\n\n135\n00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:13.075\nAnd that's where we get 86 term,\nthe x86 term.\n\n136\n00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:13.975\nBut really,\n\n137\n00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:18.275\nwhen it comes to 64-bit architecture,\nit isn't Intel that we follow.\n\n138\n00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:19.985\nIt's what's known as AMD 64.\n\n139\n00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:22.885\nAMD 64 is actually 64-bit architecture,\nand\n\n140\n00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:26.120\nthat's what you might see\nthings like drivers, right?\n\n141\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.847\nLittle piece of software that allows you\nto communicate with your hardware might\n\n142\n00:07:29.847 --> 00:07:30.790\nbe called AMD64.\n\n143\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.696\nYou might see x64.\n\n144\n00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:36.350\nNow, does that mean Intel\ndidn't have a 64-bit platform?\n\n145\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.140\nYeah, they had a 64-bit platform.\n\n146\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.170\nIt wasn't that great, and it wasn't\nthat popular, and that was IA 64.\n\n147\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, they named it something strange.\n\n148\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Like Intel Architecture, IA-64.\n\n149\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.613\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and people were like\nwhy didn't you just call it x64?\n\n150\n00:07:48.613 --> 00:07:52.710\nYou got x86, and they kind of like\nbehind the 8-Ball on that, right?\n\n151\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n&gt;&gt; AMD cam along and\n\n152\n00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.080\nsaid If you're not gonna,\nI sure as heck will [LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what they did is\nthey also have a work-around for\n\n154\n00:07:59.643 --> 00:08:02.706\nthe instruction set, so\nyou might see well, hey,\n\n155\n00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:07.426\nwe've got this x86 architecture,\nso they also came out with x86-64.\n\n156\n00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:09.702\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is just [CROSSTALK] yeah.\n\n157\n00:08:09.702 --> 00:08:11.030\nExactly, it just throws it off.\n\n158\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.760\nSo understand basically in the,\n\n159\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.650\nsince we're talking about Windows more\nthan anything, what you're gonna see is\n\n160\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:21.574\njust like Dan mentioned in the very first\npoint of this architecture, x86, x64.\n\n161\n00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:24.225\nNow, also remember that\nthat's a memory limitation.\n\n162\n00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:26.540\n32-bits is 4 gigs.\n\n163\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.440\nBeyond that, for 64-bit, you typically\ndon't have to worry to much about\n\n164\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.420\na limitation outside of the hardware,\nalright?\n\n165\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.350\nAll right, so, next thing we\nhave to talk a little bit about,\n\n166\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.490\nwe talked about the versions of\nthe operating system and the additions.\n\n167\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.990\nAnd you might say, well, wait a second,\nWes, didn't you say features and\n\n168\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.810\ninstallation?\n\n169\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.050\nWhat the heck would I worry\nabout versions and additions?\n\n170\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.010\nWell, really tells you what features\nare gonna be available in your\n\n171\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.740\noperating system, and\nthey could ask you on the exam.\n\n172\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.660\nAll right, what I mean by that is if you\nget, typically, if you need a little bit\n\n173\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.994\nmore in depth, understand that we\ndo have our full version of A+, but\n\n174\n00:09:00.994 --> 00:09:03.949\nwhen you get home editions of Windows,\nright?\n\n175\n00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:07.405\nYou don't get business class features,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:08.820\nLet me give you an example.\n\n177\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.970\nIf I get a home edition of Vista,\nand Vista's by the timing\n\n178\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.850\nthat you're probably watching this you're\nsaying, well, I don't have Vista anyway.\n\n179\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:22.570\nBut even in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, if\nyou have the Home-centric editions, right?\n\n180\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.290\nHome Premium and Windows 7, Home Basic.\n\n181\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.360\nYou aren't gonna be able to\nuse something like BitLocker.\n\n182\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.110\nBitLocker's not even included in it,\nright?\n\n183\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.790\nBecause BitLocker is a drive encryption\ntechnology that they say, you know what?\n\n184\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.928\nThat's probably something\na corporate users gonna use, right?\n\n185\n00:09:37.928 --> 00:09:41.470\nThat's something that an enterprise,\nlike for instance,\n\n186\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.010\nthe corporation that Dan used to work for\ndealt with sensitive information, right?\n\n187\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.800\nThey might wanna implement something like\nBitlocker to do drive encryption to make\n\n188\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.470\nsure that the mobile devices that they\nhave, more specifically like the laptops,\n\n189\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.006\nthat maybe have to go out\non site to do a claim,\n\n190\n00:09:57.006 --> 00:09:59.548\nif they get lost,\nif they get stolen, right,\n\n191\n00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:03.290\nthat that information doesn't make it\ninto the wrong unauthorized hands, right?\n\n192\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.610\nSo that's gonna be something that\nyou see in your business additions.\n\n193\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.790\nThe Ultimate additions we\nalso want you to know.\n\n194\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.710\nWhen it comes to those additions,\nthose typically have all the features.\n\n195\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.200\nEvery feature you find\nin the Home editions and\n\n196\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.580\nthe business editions all\nwrapped into one, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.558\nSo please keep that in mind.\n\n198\n00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:26.125\nThe other editions of Windows Vista,\nwell, Windows Vista and\n\n199\n00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.235\nWindows 7, they had the Ultimate editions.\n\n200\n00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:31.065\nAnd then when Windows 8 came out they\nsaid, you know what, there are so\n\n201\n00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:32.505\nmany different editions.\n\n202\n00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:33.665\nThere's Home Basic.\n\n203\n00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:35.855\nNo, actually, let's go the whole list.\n\n204\n00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:39.125\nHome Starter, Home Basic,\nHome Premium, Business, and\n\n205\n00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:42.230\nthen they changed it to\nProfessional in Windows 7.\n\n206\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.790\nEnterprise and Ultimate.\n\n207\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.680\n&gt;&gt; They realized they had too many\nirons in the fire at this point.\n\n208\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.780\n&gt;&gt; I think they did, Dan,\nyeah, good way to put that.\n\n209\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.600\nSo when Windows 8.1, and now even\ntoday with later versions of Windows,\n\n210\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.240\nthey have three editions,\nmake it a lot easier.\n\n211\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.920\nYou have a Home edition, and\nyou have a Professional edition.\n\n212\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.580\nHome edition is for home-centric.\n\n213\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.440\nProfessional edition is for\nyour business environments.\n\n214\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.210\nBut there is a third one, right,\nthat all of them have, and\n\n215\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.198\nthat's called an Enterprise level, right?\n\n216\n00:11:08.198 --> 00:11:12.660\nToday, Windows 8.1 would be Home,\nand they don't even call it home,\n\n217\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.830\nthey call it Windows 8.\n\n218\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.710\nAnd they have Windows 8.1, if you will,\nProfessional, or Pro they call it.\n\n219\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.938\nAnd then they have Windows 8,\nWindows 8.1, Enterprise.\n\n220\n00:11:21.938 --> 00:11:23.860\nThat's also in Vista and Windows 7.\n\n221\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.890\nNow, this is for companies that need\nlots of editions of Windows, right?\n\n222\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.110\nI believe the volume license agreement\nwith Microsoft is 250 editions, or\n\n223\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.680\nlicense and above, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.050\nWell, when you have that bulk of operating\nsystems that you need to purchase,\n\n225\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.170\nat a certain point they realize that\nthat's a lot of money to buy individual\n\n226\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.550\nWindows operating systems.\n\n227\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.250\nSo they allow you to enter into\nan Enterprise level contract, right?\n\n228\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.480\nSo what does Enterprise features have?\n\n229\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.690\nEverything that the Ultimate editions do.\n\n230\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.370\nThink of it today is that an Ultimate\nedition is kind of like your Enterprise.\n\n231\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.730\nIt gives you all of those\nbusiness class features.\n\n232\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.210\nThings like applocker, being able to\ncontrol applications that users can\n\n233\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.690\nexecute on their machines, right?\n\n234\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.500\nIn a home environment,\nif you need that kind of functionality,\n\n235\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.570\nyou use parental controls.\n\n236\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.580\nParental controls is not something\nyou're probably gonna set up inside of\n\n237\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.440\na corporate environment.\n\n238\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.180\nBut an admin like Dan would\nwanna be able to push out\n\n239\n00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.480\na setting across the entire\nnetwork that says, no,\n\n240\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.440\nyou're not gonna use that unlicensed,\nunauthorized piece of software.\n\n241\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.580\nI'm locking it down.\n\n242\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.000\nYou're gonna use what we paid for so\n\n243\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.250\nthat we don't have some kind\nof license violation, right?\n\n244\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.200\nAgain, to kind of give you an example.\n\n245\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.430\nSo I do want you to be aware of that.\n\n246\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.960\nNext thing you have to worry about are\nthings like, they call them upgrade paths.\n\n247\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.040\nWhat is an upgrade?\n\n248\n00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.115\nWell, we got a couple of\ndifferent types of upgrades here.\n\n249\n00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:43.880\nWe've got what's known as a,\nwell, let's go ahead and\n\n250\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.970\ntalk about what an upgrade is in general,\nall right?\n\n251\n00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.660\nAn upgrade is when I take\nan older operating system,\n\n252\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.120\nolder version of Windows, and I upgrade it\nto a newer version of Windows, all right?\n\n253\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.560\nAnd there are certain upgrade\npaths that you have to follow.\n\n254\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.570\nCertain operating systems can be\nupgraded to certain editions of Windows.\n\n255\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.236\nCertain, I should say not\noperating systems, but\n\n256\n00:13:03.236 --> 00:13:07.520\ncertain editions of Windows can only be\nupgraded to certain editions of Windows.\n\n257\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.780\nAnd let me show you what I mean here, make\nit a little bit less confusing, right?\n\n258\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.950\nSo in upgrade paths right here,\nwe've got Vista with service pack one and\n\n259\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.580\nservice pack two, right?\n\n260\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.340\nHome Basic can upgrade to\nHome Basic Premium or Ultimate.\n\n261\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.700\nNotice here, and you guys can again,\nin the accelerated edition\n\n262\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.030\nyou might have to pause this to\nkinda memorize this information.\n\n263\n00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.220\nWe want you to memorize the information.\n\n264\n00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.227\nBut notice one thing that\nisn't in this list, right?\n\n265\n00:13:32.227 --> 00:13:37.250\nNotice that I can't take Home Basic and\nupgrade it to Professional Windows 7.\n\n266\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.060\nIt's not allowed, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.310\nYou want those features,\nyou want professional features,\n\n268\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.830\nyou gotta go all the way up to Ultimate.\n\n269\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.060\nThat's just the way\nthe upgrade path works.\n\n270\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.220\nNotice when I have Business.\n\n271\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.730\nBusiness already has in Vista\na lot of extra features\n\n272\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.420\nthat the Home Premium editions didn't.\n\n273\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.089\nSo I can't do a downgrade, right?\n\n274\n00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:59.268\nI can't go from business to Home Basic,\nright?\n\n275\n00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:00.210\nYou just can't do that.\n\n276\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.250\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't make sense to.\n\n277\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.184\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't, right?\n\n278\n00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:04.040\nSo there are upgrade paths.\n\n279\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.950\nEnterprise requires\na volume license agreement.\n\n280\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.090\nEnterprise to Enterprise, right?\n\n281\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.600\nThat's part of something that\nthey call software assurance.\n\n282\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.620\nAnd this is actually a pretty\ngood thing with Microsoft, right?\n\n283\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.295\nLet's say you go to Microsoft,\n\n284\n00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:19.498\nyou say here's a $10,000 check for\nour additions of Windows that we need.\n\n285\n00:14:19.498 --> 00:14:21.920\nThey say okay,\nhere's your operating systems.\n\n286\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.460\nAnd six months later they come out\nwith a new version of Windows.\n\n287\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.330\nYou'd probably feel left out, right?\n\n288\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.390\nYou'd probably feel a little irritated by\nthe fact that you just dropped a big old\n\n289\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.750\ncheck like that, or maybe even more,\nif you've got thousands of computers,\n\n290\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.430\nand now there's a new\noperating system out.\n\n291\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.270\nWell, guess what?\n\n292\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.460\nSoftware assurance says, hey, if we\ncome out with a new product, guess what?\n\n293\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.810\nThat license rolls over to\nthe new edition of Windows.\n\n294\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.400\nAnd that's why Enterprise to Enterprise,\nthat's the way that works.\n\n295\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.730\nUltimate to Ultimate as well.\n\n296\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.210\nSo we can look here,\nif we can see Ultimate to Ultimate.\n\n297\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.131\nAnd look at all the different editions.\n\n298\n00:14:54.131 --> 00:14:56.646\nThat's why it was great\nwhen we see Windows 8.\n\n299\n00:14:56.646 --> 00:15:00.280\nNow you can also do, within Windows 7,\nyou can do it's upgrades.\n\n300\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.180\nLet's say I started out\nwith the Starter Package.\n\n301\n00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.965\nWell, that's redundant,\nstarted out with Starter.\n\n302\n00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:07.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can upgrade to the next level up,\n\n303\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.100\nHome Premium, Professional,\nand Ultimate, right?\n\n304\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.850\nYou look here, I can go from Professional.\n\n305\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.530\nNow, and you guys, again, take a second\nif you need to, and stop the video, and\n\n306\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.610\nyou can kinda write these down, right?\n\n307\n00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.390\nBut notice that I'm always stepping up.\n\n308\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.700\nYou're not stepping back, all right?.\n\n309\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.730\nHome Premium, I can go to Professional.\n\n310\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.210\nI can go a step up, right?\n\n311\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.350\nCuz I've already got Windows 7.\n\n312\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not really an upgrade if you're\nstaying either in the same level,\n\n313\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.560\nor going the other way.\n\n314\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.350\nThat's not an upgrade.\n\n315\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.119\nWe're going up to the next\nthing that's better, right?\n\n316\n00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good point.\n\n317\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.144\nAnd I would say, and\nI didn't even think about that,\n\n318\n00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:45.295\nthat's probably a good way\nto remember it for the exam.\n\n319\n00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:49.260\nSo a little exam tip you got from Dan, and\nI wasn't even thinking about that, great.\n\n320\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.499\nUpgrade always ups\nwhatever the features are.\n\n321\n00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:54.364\nNotice that I can go from professional.\n\n322\n00:15:54.364 --> 00:15:57.210\nLet's say I got a pro machine.\n\n323\n00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.620\nBut I want some of the extra features\nthat Ultimate would give me.\n\n324\n00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.960\nSo, well, now I want that.\n\n325\n00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.270\nWell, you could upgrade to Ultimate.\n\n326\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.240\nNow, when we start getting in\nWindows 7 and Windows 8, I love it.\n\n327\n00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.949\nBoy, this list just gets littler and\nlittler, right?\n\n328\n00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:12.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice that we have Windows 8 and\n\n329\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.350\nWindows 8 Pro.\n\n330\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.750\nAnything lower can go to Windows 8 and\nWindows Pro, right?\n\n331\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.840\nif we look at Professional,\nProfessional can go to Windows 8 Pro.\n\n332\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.687\nWindows 7 Ultimate can go\nto Windows 8 Pro, right?\n\n333\n00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:29.280\nCuz that's the only three things\nthat they have in Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n334\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.007\nMake it easy.\n\n335\n00:16:30.007 --> 00:16:33.383\nAnd you're gonna see, I could also\ndo the same thing for Windows 8.1.\n\n336\n00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:35.962\nAgain, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n337\n00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.145\nThey have just Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.\n\n338\n00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:42.562\nThey have Windows 8 or 8.1 Pro.\n\n339\n00:16:42.562 --> 00:16:44.798\nAnd then Windows 8 or 8.1 Enterprise.\n\n340\n00:16:44.798 --> 00:16:47.450\nNotice Enterprise isn't in the list?\n\n341\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.490\nIt's Enterprise to Enterprise.\n\n342\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.641\nThat's all, you can always\nremember that one, all right?\n\n343\n00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:54.065\nOther things.\n\n344\n00:16:54.065 --> 00:16:56.880\nI wanna go from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.\n\n345\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.230\nAgain, architecture to architecture.\n\n346\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.710\nUpgrade, I really like that.\n\n347\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.653\nI'm gonna steal that, right?\n\n348\n00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even if the camera says\n\n349\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.961\nyou said it first, I'm stealing it.\n\n350\n00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:07.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a Wes Bryant original.\n\n351\n00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:08.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n352\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.220\nSo notice,\nwe have Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.\n\n353\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.820\nWindows 8 to Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\n354\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.550\nYou can always see that it's stepping up.\n\n355\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.120\nThere was a Media Center for a little bit,\nWindows 8 Pro with Media Center,\n\n356\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.460\nbut I didn't really agree with this one.\n\n357\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.460\nI kinda liked Media Center, but\nthey stripped Media Center out of it.\n\n358\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.390\nAnd the reason they did\nthat is because they said,\n\n359\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.490\nwell, a lot of people are using\nother third-party type software.\n\n360\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:33.670\nMedia Center basically\nallows you to stream TV,\n\n361\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.740\nif you will, and videos and\nstuff to your computer as well.\n\n362\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.507\nWe've got so many different\nproducts today that do that.\n\n363\n00:17:40.507 --> 00:17:42.801\nThe were like, well, a lot of people\nare going with a third party, so\n\n364\n00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:44.316\nwe'll go ahead and\njust take it out of there.\n\n365\n00:17:44.316 --> 00:17:48.720\nAll right, Windows 8.1,\nthat's a small list.\n\n366\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.207\nYou got Windows 8.1,\nit can go to Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\n367\n00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:54.895\n&gt;&gt; I think I can remember that one, Wes.\n\n368\n00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:56.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a tough one, bud.\n\n369\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.009\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] right?\n\n371\n00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:02.370\nSome special considerations that I\nwant you to keep in mind, all right?\n\n372\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.000\nWe don't do cross architecture, all right?\n\n373\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.920\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n374\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.370\nAnd that could be, exam alert, I can see\nthat kinda being an exam alert, right?\n\n375\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.610\nThese are few little facts that if you\ncan get them under your belt it will\n\n376\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.850\naccelerate your training,\naccelerate what you your productivity and\n\n377\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.426\nyour success on the exam, right?\n\n378\n00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:23.665\nNo cross architecture upgrades, right?\n\n379\n00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:25.704\nCan't go 32 bit, 64.\n\n380\n00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.421\nCan't go 64 to 32 bit.\n\n381\n00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:29.080\nDoesn't work that way.\n\n382\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.720\nThe other thing is Cross Language, right?\n\n383\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.480\nSo you'll see that with\nyour installation media,\n\n384\n00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.960\na lot of times it will have the two\nletter country code in front of it.\n\n385\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.460\nFor instance, here in the States here, and\n\n386\n00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.110\nI'm sure you've seen the ISOs for\nWindows there, Dan.\n\n387\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.180\nOurs usually say EN_ and then whatever the\nWindows operating system is after that.\n\n388\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.850\nJust lets us know that it's English,\nright?\n\n389\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.320\nSo, for instance, they've got the Korean\nversion and its KN_ and they've got Japan,\n\n390\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.040\nI think it's JP, isn't it?\n\n391\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.610\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n392\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.750\n&gt;&gt; JP or JN, something like that.\n\n393\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.470\n&gt;&gt; I think it's JP.\n\n394\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.400\n&gt;&gt; JP, yeah, and it's underscore, right?\n\n395\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.520\nSo you can't do cross language.\n\n396\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.100\nThat's not supported.\n\n397\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.210\nThe only one, VL editions-\n&gt;&gt; Very large editions, right?\n\n398\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.450\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n399\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.032\n&gt;&gt; Very large editions, that's right.\n\n400\n00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:10.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:11.244\n&gt;&gt; It is about,\n\n402\n00:19:11.244 --> 00:19:13.060\nthe ISOs are up about three?\n\n403\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.175\nWell, they're pretty big, so\nit is a very large edition.\n\n404\n00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:17.510\nThat's your volume license editions,\nright?\n\n405\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.590\nYou can do upgrades between\nvolume license editions, and\n\n406\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.530\nthat’s one of the ones,\nit just makes it easy to remember.\n\n407\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.930\nYou have Enterprise, the only thing\nyou’re upgrading to is Enterprise, and\n\n408\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.650\nnothing in between.\n\n409\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.394\nAnd so it makes it easier so you don't\nhave to remember all these different\n\n410\n00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:33.590\neditions, which is one of the great\nthings I like about the new model.\n\n411\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.120\nThree different editions\nof that version of Windows.\n\n412\n00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stop killing us with all these\n7,000 different editions of Windows.\n\n413\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.370\nWe get it, it’s Windows.\n\n414\n00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Make one for the Home, make one for\n\n415\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.650\nthe Enterprise level, and\nmake some for Professional.\n\n416\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.710\nIt's that simple.\n\n417\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n418\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.250\nNow, some of the other things\nthat they talk with upgrades.\n\n419\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.650\nI went ahead and put in the same list as,\nthese are the upgrades and\n\n420\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.580\nthe upgrade paths.\n\n421\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.890\nLike knowing what an upgrade is, right?\n\n422\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.220\nI will tell you,\n\n423\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.960\none last thing that I wanna mention is\nthat there are upgrades that are in-place\n\n424\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.610\nupgrades, and they're what are known as\nclean installation upgrades, all right?\n\n425\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.650\nLet me tell you what I mean by that.\n\n426\n00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:14.940\nLet's say that you wanna upgrade\nto edition that doesn't support\n\n427\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.310\nan in-place upgrade, which means I\ntake the older operating system,\n\n428\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.000\nolder version of Windows,\nand I wanna do that upgrade.\n\n429\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.870\nI wanna upgrade by putting the newer\nversion of Windows on top of it.\n\n430\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.740\nIf that's supported,\nthat's called an in-place upgrade, right?\n\n431\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.590\nCuz your old operating system is still in\nplace when you upgrade the old one, right?\n\n432\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.030\nI'm gonna give you\na classic example of that.\n\n433\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.794\nYou have Windows 8.\n\n434\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.947\nYou wanted to go to Windows 8.1 Pro?\n\n435\n00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:38.860\nIn-place upgrade.\n\n436\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.710\nSlap it right over the top.\n\n437\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.470\n&gt;&gt; So you take your box, you slap\nthe disc in, you run the installer or\n\n438\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.810\nthe upgrade little wizard,\nyou walk through it, next thing you know,\n\n439\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.380\nyou reboot the box, your on 8.1 from 8.0.\n\n440\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n441\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.750\nNow, there's also what's known as\nkind of like a wipe and load..\n\n442\n00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.710\nAnd that is an upgrade that\nrequires a clean installation.\n\n443\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.470\nI go to Microsoft, because when you pay\nfor an upgrade license, they say, well,\n\n444\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.940\nyou already have Windows, technically,\nyou really didn't to upgrade.\n\n445\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.130\nSo, we'll give you a deal,\nwe'll encourage you to upgrade.\n\n446\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:09.940\nYou'll pay less for\n\n447\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.260\nthe operating system than buying it brand\nnew if you never had the operating system.\n\n448\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.750\nThat's, some people are like,\nwell, why don't I just go out and\n\n449\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.930\nbuy the operating system?\n\n450\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.140\nWhy would I upgrade at all?\n\n451\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.280\nBecause you typically get almost\n$100 dollars off per edition.\n\n452\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.640\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty good savings.\n\n453\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n454\n00:21:23.295 --> 00:21:25.360\nSo that's why I mention that,\nand that's why they have it.\n\n455\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.569\nThey make it worth your while,\nif you will,\n\n456\n00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:29.619\nto upgrade to the new operating system.\n\n457\n00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:33.168\nBut if it's not supported,\na direct in-place upgrade,\n\n458\n00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:35.422\nyou have to do a clean installation.\n\n459\n00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:38.558\nWhich you go to Microsoft,\nyou pay them for the Operating System,\n\n460\n00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:42.422\nyou pay maybe the discount, if you will,\nand you have to format your hard drive and\n\n461\n00:21:42.422 --> 00:21:45.330\nyou install the new operating\nsystem on top of it.\n\n462\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.400\nAll of these upgrades require\na previous licensed version of Windows.\n\n463\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.171\nDon't think you're gonna\nbe able to get the turn and\n\n464\n00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:56.520\nburn cracked version of Windows, and\nthat this is gonna allow you to upgrade.\n\n465\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.990\nSo please keep that in mind, too.\n\n466\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.085\n&gt;&gt; This is what I love about Linux.\n\n467\n00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:01.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about this stuff.\n\n468\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n469\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.980\nthat's a good point, right?\n\n470\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.630\nIn other operating systems,\nwe talk about closed source and\n\n471\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.660\nproprietary versus open source.\n\n472\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.920\nMicrosoft has Windows under a closed\nsource proprietary implementation.\n\n473\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.900\nAll right, so upgrades.\n\n474\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.390\nOne of the last things I want to talk\nabout when it comes to upgrades,\n\n475\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.235\nthen we'll mention just a few of\nthe features that you need to be aware of,\n\n476\n00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:24.310\nall right, are these two upgrade\nutilities that we have right here.\n\n477\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.758\nWe have what is known as Easy Transfer,\n\n478\n00:22:26.758 --> 00:22:30.200\nwe have what's known as\na User State Migration Tool.\n\n479\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.720\nSo if we could take a look at here,\nyou can see Easy Transfer,\n\n480\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.150\nWindow's Easy Transfer is inside of,\nwell, Windows.\n\n481\n00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.557\nAnd in fact, let me go ahead and\nget into my Windows 8.\n\n482\n00:22:39.557 --> 00:22:41.540\nActually, let's go to Windows 7.\n\n483\n00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.682\nAnd I'll tell you why I'm\ngoing to Windows 7 and\n\n484\n00:22:43.682 --> 00:22:45.522\nI didn't go to Windows 8 here, in a sec.\n\n485\n00:22:45.522 --> 00:22:46.960\nAnd you'll see, it's actually in the list.\n\n486\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.720\nI think I can just type easy.\n\n487\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.412\nAll right, yeah, well,\nthat makes it easy, right?\n\n488\n00:22:50.412 --> 00:22:52.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n489\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.710\nAll right, Windows Easy Transfer is\ncalled Easy Transfer for a reason.\n\n490\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.670\nIt's a really quick wizard\ndriven easy breezy way to\n\n491\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.110\ntake your data, migrate it, and\ntransfer it over to the new\n\n492\n00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.530\noperating system when you decide\nto do the upgrade, right?\n\n493\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.570\n&gt;&gt; Now hold up there, Wes.\n\n494\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.950\nIsn't there also some something\ncalled the User State Migration Tool?\n\n495\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Scary.\n\n496\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Scary.\n\n497\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.610\nYou gotta watch that one, right?\n\n498\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.470\nBecause this is GUI drive, wizard based,\nand even Wes can handle the word Next.\n\n499\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.660\nBut what I can´t do is\ntype to save my life.\n\n500\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, you gotta be careful\n\n501\n00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.350\nwith the next one.\n\n502\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.790\nAnd the next one, if we look back\nhere at my slide, is the USMT,\n\n503\n00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.560\nthe User State Migration Tool.\n\n504\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.060\nAnd with that USMT it´s\na little bit different, right?\n\n505\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.380\nSee, the Easy Transfer is you can see\nsome of the things that we talked about.\n\n506\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.550\nSmall deployments.\n\n507\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.060\nMicrosoft really recommends\nno more than five computers.\n\n508\n00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.892\nYou do have cable, too.\n\n509\n00:23:39.892 --> 00:23:42.780\nThey had an Easy Transfer cable\nthat you can plug between machines.\n\n510\n00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.660\n&gt;&gt; I remember that.\n&gt;&gt; And it would\n\n511\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.090\ndo it automatically for you.\n\n512\n00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.624\nSo again, they try to make it easy.\n\n513\n00:23:46.624 --> 00:23:49.365\nAgain, it's It's wizard driven.\n\n514\n00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:51.411\nNow one of the reasons\nI didn't go to 8.1 for\n\n515\n00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:53.679\nit is because it's deprecated\nin later versions.\n\n516\n00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:56.470\nWhen they came out with something\nknown as file history, they said hey,\n\n517\n00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.942\nif you're gonna back up your information,\nuse file history and\n\n518\n00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:00.520\nback it up to an external drive.\n\n519\n00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.460\nThen if you need to upgrade,\n\n520\n00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.860\nyou can pull that information\nfrom file history back down.\n\n521\n00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.822\nUser State Migration, like I said, this\ntool,I'm just gonna say, whoa now, whoa.\n\n522\n00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:12.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slow the horses right, it's because it\n\n523\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.525\nis command line driven and it is there for\nmajor deployments, large deployments.\n\n524\n00:24:17.525 --> 00:24:21.169\nIt can do 500,000 computers,\nit's script based and\n\n525\n00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:25.821\nit is XML based right, it's in the command\nline, so you have to know syntax.\n\n526\n00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:29.347\nAnd when I say command line, we're gonna\ntalk about command line in another\n\n527\n00:24:29.347 --> 00:24:31.883\nepisode, but\nwe're talking about the command prompt\n\n528\n00:24:31.883 --> 00:24:35.483\nentering into text based commands, and\nyou have to know what you're doing.\n\n529\n00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:36.960\nIt has two utilities.\n\n530\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.690\nIt has what's known as scanstate.exe and\nloadstate.exe.\n\n531\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.810\nOn the computer that you wanna take and\nmigrate the information on,\n\n532\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.200\nyou run scanstate.\n\n533\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.360\nThat's what grabs that information.\n\n534\n00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.330\nThen you take that information from the\nlocation that you saved it to and after\n\n535\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.996\nyou do the upgrade, or if you're upgrading\nit to a completely different machine,\n\n536\n00:24:54.996 --> 00:24:57.940\nyou'll run loadstate and\nthat loads all of those settings.\n\n537\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.490\nAgain that's what's known as a migration,\nall right so no USMT.\n\n538\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.090\nAll right, now, last few things that\nwe wanna say in this, and I know we're\n\n539\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.930\ndefinitely gonna go into a part two, we'll\ntake care of the installation coming up,\n\n540\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.580\nis that I just want to kinda move through\na couple of the features that you have\n\n541\n00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.040\ninside of your Window's operating system.\n\n542\n00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.580\nOne of the things that they call\nout is the Arrow Interface.\n\n543\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.150\nThe Arrow Interface is in Windows 7.\n\n544\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.360\nNow it's not in Windows 8.\n\n545\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.472\nIt's not in Windows 10.\n\n546\n00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:24.744\nActually it was in Windows-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Vista.\n\n547\n00:25:24.744 --> 00:25:26.291\n&gt;&gt; As well too, that's right.\n\n548\n00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.563\nIt's in Windows Vista and\nit's in Windows 7.\n\n549\n00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:33.347\nIt was a nice visually rich interface I\nremember, I think is how Microsoft used\n\n550\n00:25:33.347 --> 00:25:38.205\nthe branding was in my Microsoft training,\nis that it allows translucencies,\n\n551\n00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:41.560\nin fact let me show you some\nof the Arrow features here.\n\n552\n00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.220\nIf I opened up a window here,\nit allows you to do snap like that,\n\n553\n00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.120\nthe snap feature.\n\n554\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.480\nI can drag things to the side, right?\n\n555\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.530\nI can drag things to the other side and\nit snaps side by side, so it's got\n\n556\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.090\na lot of productivity features, but again\nit's more of a visually rich interface.\n\n557\n00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.440\nDoes require some extra resources.\n\n558\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.192\nBy today's standards, these aren't really\ntoo bad, but in the days that it came out\n\n559\n00:26:04.192 --> 00:26:07.690\nit did require certain bit of\nvideo graphics memory and stuff,\n\n560\n00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.861\nnot something that you really\nhave to worry about today.\n\n561\n00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.850\nNow you also have what\nare known as gadgets.\n\n562\n00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.270\nIf you right-click on the desktop,\nyou can see gadgets here.\n\n563\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.510\nGadgets are are great because these\nare like little mini applications.\n\n564\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.700\nNow in the days of Vista,\n\n565\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.960\nthe applications were actually docked to\nsomething known as the sidebar over here.\n\n566\n00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.240\nThat sidebar also took\nup additional resources.\n\n567\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.120\nIn Windows 7, they said you know what?\n\n568\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.100\nIf you can take, and you can move these.\n\n569\n00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.050\nOops, let me just close that down.\n\n570\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.460\nIf you can take these gadgets,\nand what you can do is,\n\n571\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.420\nyou can move them out of the side bar,\nif you didn't want them docked there, and\n\n572\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.480\nyou can move them all around.\n\n573\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.100\nSo, they said, you know what?\n\n574\n00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.070\nSince, you can already take them and\nmove them around anyways,\n\n575\n00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.120\nwhat's the point of the side bar,\nso they got rid of it.\n\n576\n00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why the side bar isn't\n\n577\n00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:55.753\nhere in Windows 7.\n\n578\n00:26:55.753 --> 00:26:59.198\nAnd I will tell you that gadgets\nhave been completely done\n\n579\n00:26:59.198 --> 00:27:02.297\naway with inside of Windows 8 and\nWindows 8.1.\n\n580\n00:27:02.297 --> 00:27:04.963\nThere were some security\nvulnerabilities but,\n\n581\n00:27:04.963 --> 00:27:08.156\nin Windows 7 you do have these\nmany apps known as gadgets.\n\n582\n00:27:08.156 --> 00:27:11.680\nNow Vista also introduced something\nknown as the User Account Control.\n\n583\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.530\nThis is something known as\nthe Standard Users Security Architecture.\n\n584\n00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.830\nIt is something that we do have today, and\n\n585\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.576\nit is something that you\nhave to be aware of.\n\n586\n00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:22.050\nWhen we talk about\nStandard User Security Architecture,\n\n587\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.600\nwe're actually talking about something\nthat only allows an administrator,\n\n588\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.700\nto make modifications to your registry,\ninstall software and\n\n589\n00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.500\nto configure key security settings, right?\n\n590\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.570\nI can show you here real quick,\nif I go to the Start button.\n\n591\n00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.900\nGo to Control Panel.\n\n592\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.630\nYou'll notice that there\nare User Accounts.\n\n593\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.890\nThen we'll go to User Accounts again, and\n\n594\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.790\nyou'll notice that we can manage our user\naccount settings, right here, all right?\n\n595\n00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.510\nIt depends on how strict you want it.\n\n596\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.718\nDepends on where you move the slider bar,\nI would say that on your exam you wanna\n\n597\n00:27:55.718 --> 00:27:58.420\npay attention to what these\ndifferent settings do.\n\n598\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.287\nNow that being said, man, I'm looking\ndown our list and it does look like\n\n599\n00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:03.890\nwe're running out of time,\nwe got a few more things to talk about.\n\n600\n00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.305\nSo, how about this?\n\n601\n00:28:05.305 --> 00:28:06.795\nWe'll go ahead, we'll go into a part two.\n\n602\n00:28:06.795 --> 00:28:09.738\nAnd what I was thinking about,\nis we can finish through the features, and\n\n603\n00:28:09.738 --> 00:28:12.019\nwe can run through some\ninstallation basics, because,\n\n604\n00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:14.345\nwell, I don't think we're\ngonna fit it in this one.\n\n605\n00:28:14.345 --> 00:28:15.295\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem Wes.\n\n606\n00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:17.445\nWe can definitely roll part two out for\nyou.\n\n607\n00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:21.901\nWe're always happy to extend that\nprivilege to our good SMEs here\n\n608\n00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:22.962\nat ITPro.TV.\n\n609\n00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:26.382\nThat being said, you're right looking at\nthat clock, we are well out

00:00:06.436\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:08.093\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:11.432\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:16.900\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.870\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.170\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with our accelerated A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.900\nJoining us back in the studio yet again to\nlend his expertise on that very topic for\n\n10\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.130\nus our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan,\nWes welcome back sir how's it going.\n\n11\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great good to be here,\ngood to finish up\n\n12\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.360\nthis episode in which we are talking about\nwell Windows features and installations.\n\n13\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.970\nKeep in mind in the first part\nwe talked a little bit about.\n\n14\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.840\nWell, Windows in general, architecture.\n\n15\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.120\nWe talked a little bit about upgrades.\n\n16\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.200\nAnd what you can expect,\npotentially I guess, to see on the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.650\nWe never know exactly what questions\nyou're going to get on there.\n\n18\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.140\nBut remember that you need to know\nwhat an upgrade is, upgrade paths,\n\n19\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.270\nand then some of the tools in utilities\nthat you use to do upgrades, and\n\n20\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.950\nto do basically transferring\nof your information.\n\n21\n00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.900\nWe also talked about features too,\nwe want you to keep in mind that there\n\n22\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.400\nare a series of features, and they're in\nWindows, that you have to be aware of.\n\n23\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570\nNow, that also lends itself to remember\nwe talked about some of the different\n\n24\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.770\neditions in Windows, right.\n\n25\n00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.370\nProfessional editions have professional\nlevel features that you need inside of\n\n26\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.810\na corporate environment, versus maybe\nyou have just a home environment, right?\n\n27\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.670\nIf you have a home environment then\nyou're probably not gonna need some of\n\n28\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.890\nthose business class features.\n\n29\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.000\nThat is why it is important to also\nknow the versions, likewise too.\n\n30\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.680\nNow we left off, we were talking about\nfeatures, we've talked about arrow\n\n31\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.960\nfeatures or the arrow interface, talked\na little bit about gadgets and sidebar.\n\n32\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.520\nDo you want you to keep in mind that\nwe also talked about the user account\n\n33\n00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.930\ncontrol settings.\n\n34\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.760\nKeep in mind too that when we talk about\nthe user account control settings,\n\n35\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.280\nthis is something that came out in Vista.\n\n36\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.200\nIt isn't in the earlier editions,\n\n37\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.460\nwhich are pretty much outdated\nby today's date and time as XP.\n\n38\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.930\nRemember the user account control\nsettings that are now in every\n\n39\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.060\nWindow operating system that you will get.\n\n40\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.700\nAll right, moving down through the list\nhere, we've got some other things that we\n\n41\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.430\nneed to talk about if you do have,\nthings like your business class editions.\n\n42\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.360\nIf you have Professional,\nthis feature will be available.\n\n43\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.180\nIf you have the Home editions,\nthey will not be available and\n\n44\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.370\nthat's something known as\nth BitLocker technology.\n\n45\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.940\nBitLocker is basically a drive encryption\ntechnology, and we wanna go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.830\nwe wanna take a look at it.\n\n47\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.140\nSo if we dive down into our Control Panel,\n\n48\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.640\njust by pushing Start on the left\nhand side of your screen here.\n\n49\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.370\nWe'll choose Control Panel.\n\n50\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.850\nThen we'll go to System and Security.\n\n51\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.320\nAnd inside of System and\n\n52\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.680\nSecurity, we're gonna see that we\ndo have BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n53\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.460\nAll right now with\nBitLocker Drive Encryption,\n\n54\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.310\nthis is the utility that allows you\nto basically like it says you know,\n\n55\n00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.800\nhelps you prevent unauthorized access\nto files stored on the drive basically,\n\n56\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.690\nprotects against things\nlike offline file attacks.\n\n57\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.740\nWhat I mean by offline file attacks,\nis when the computer is turned off,\n\n58\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.250\nif that hard drive is stolen and\nit's put into another machine,\n\n59\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.460\nBitLocker will require, well, actually,\nit'll go into a recovery mode.\n\n60\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.700\nBecause it works with something known\nas a TPM, a trusted platform module,\n\n61\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.910\nwhich is a little processor that\nis built into your motherboard.\n\n62\n00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.430\nThat's tied directly to\nBitLocker drive encryption.\n\n63\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.870\nUnderstand that the Bit Locker\ndrive encryption is something\n\n64\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.670\nthat helps you to protect\nyour data on your machines.\n\n65\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.770\nNow there's also something\nknown as Bit Locker o Go and\n\n66\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.870\nthat was kind of\nan extension to Bit Locker.\n\n67\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.470\nBecause with the prevalence and\nsecurity, basically security concerns of\n\n68\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.740\nremovable media, you do have the ability\nto plug in an external drive and\n\n69\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.520\nyou encrypt that external drive, right?\n\n70\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.400\nSo there's also a BitLocker to go\nthat I do wanna mention likewise.\n\n71\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.070\nNow some of the other technologies that\nyou have to be aware of inside of your\n\n72\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.540\noperating system or\nwhat are known as System restore.\n\n73\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.030\nAll right, If we look at System restore,\n\n74\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.760\nthe easy way that we can get to this, well\nwe can actually go to our start button.\n\n75\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.080\nIf I go ahead,\non our Windows desktop here,\n\n76\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.920\nI'll push start, couple different\nways that we can get to this.\n\n77\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.420\nWe can right click computer and\nwe can choose properties here.\n\n78\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.750\nThe other way that we could do this is,\nwe could press start and\n\n79\n00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.450\nwe could basically go to control panel\nin the control panel from start,\n\n80\n00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.560\ncontrol panel, system and security.\n\n81\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.610\nYou also have systems.\n\n82\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.250\nSo, a couple of different ways that you\ncan get to the exact same location.\n\n83\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.330\nNow you want to get here\nbecause in order to implement\n\n84\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.520\nsystem restore what you have to do is turn\non something know as system protection.\n\n85\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.480\nAnd we find that inside\nof our system properties.\n\n86\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.690\nAll right,\nif I go to advanced system settings.\n\n87\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.180\nAll right, you'll notice that across\nthe top of our system properties we've got\n\n88\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.070\na few options here.\n\n89\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.580\nComputer name, this allows us to do things\nlike join our computer domain after\n\n90\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.970\nafter we've installed it.\n\n91\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.430\nAlso allows us to look at device manager.\n\n92\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.770\nWe'll talk about this coming up.\n\n93\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.060\nWe've got the advance options too,\nbut what I'm looking for\n\n94\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.980\nmore than anything is system protection,\nall right.\n\n95\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.670\nIf system protection is turned on, you\ncan see that we have the system restore\n\n96\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.050\noption, however, we can figure this.\n\n97\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.020\nWe turn off system protection,\n\n98\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.760\nyou will notice that it will\nactually gray out system restore.\n\n99\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.310\nSo that's something a little exemplar\nthat you might want to know,\n\n100\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.720\nif that is grayed out, why would that be?\n\n101\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.630\nAnd that's typically cuz\nSystem Restore isn't turned on.\n\n102\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.420\nAll right, now System Restore,\nbasically what it allows you to do.\n\n103\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.280\nAnd Restore points\nhaven't been created and\n\n104\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.410\nI'll just briefly mention\nwhat that is about.\n\n105\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.610\nLet me see if I can.\n\n106\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.738\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I didn't catch you.\n\n107\n00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:20.780\nIs System Restored,\nis that turned on by default or\n\n108\n00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.596\nis that something we have to enable?\n\n109\n00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:24.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nWell, that's a good question, so\n\n110\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.590\nif you are talking about the system drive,\ngoing back to our machine here real quick.\n\n111\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.025\nNotice that we have local disc C here.\n\n112\n00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; If it is your operating\n\n113\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.430\ndrive by default it's turned on.\n\n114\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.690\nThe reason I'm glad you've asked is,\n\n115\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.580\nbecause if this is one of fixed data\ndrives that you got a second data\n\n116\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.830\ndrive in, System protection is not\nturned on on those drives, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.210\nSo it's another good potential exam\nquestion, so I'm glad you brought that up.\n\n118\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.050\nNow in order to use System Restore, you'll\nsee that it give me a little problem.\n\n119\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.410\nIt said, hey wait a second here, sorry\nguys, slow that down just a little bit.\n\n120\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.260\nOne of the things that it said is,\nhey there weren't any restore point so,\n\n121\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.210\nsystem restore works on as\na service called Shadow Copy.\n\n122\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.960\nShadow Copy has been around for\na long time and it's got different names.\n\n123\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.120\nVSS, we call Volume Shadow Copy\nwe like to call it.\n\n124\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.110\nThen also works with something known as\nprevious versions, and what it does is it\n\n125\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.330\nallows you to take snapshots of different\nfiles on your machine, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.350\nAnd what happens is essentially,\n\n127\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.120\nthese files are put in\na read-only state temporarily.\n\n128\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.150\nYou take a copy of it and that copy\nis stored on the local hard drive.\n\n129\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.960\nNow if you delete a file or\nyou make a modification to that file, and\n\n130\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.970\nyou need to restore to\nan earlier point in time,\n\n131\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.510\nyou can use something like\nPrevious Versions to do that.\n\n132\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.240\nVolume shadow copy also is\nthe underlying service, if you will,\n\n133\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.150\nthat your system restore runs on.\n\n134\n00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.700\nSo again, know what shadow copy is, know\nwhere it works, know that it works for\n\n135\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.460\nprevious versions inside of\nWindows as well as system restore.\n\n136\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.460\nSo that being said, where system restore\nwhen I say that it allows you to take\n\n137\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.070\npoint and time snapshots through volume\nshadow copy service or shadow copy.\n\n138\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.130\nWhat are you taking a snapshot of?\n\n139\n00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.450\nAll right well you're not taking\na snapshot understand a system restore of\n\n140\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.210\nyour files.\n\n141\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.120\nRight, those files that\nare crucial to you.\n\n142\n00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.530\nWhat you're taking\na snapshot of is a point and\n\n143\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.290\ntime configuration of system files and\nyour registry.\n\n144\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.050\nSo if you do things like for instance,\nmaybe update a driver in your operating\n\n145\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.270\nsystem, what else,\nan application you install it and\n\n146\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.440\nit become problematic right, causes\na problem within your operating system,\n\n147\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.160\nyou get a system instability, and\nwhat you can use, and let me show you here\n\n148\n00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.160\nis one of these restore points after\nyou configure it and we'll go ahead and\n\n149\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.850\nconfigure a restore point by\nchoosing not configure but create.\n\n150\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.140\nAll right, notice it say,\ncreate a restore point now.\n\n151\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.031\nAll right and then Dan I wanna\nshow you too something else,\n\n152\n00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:43.400\nyou mentioned hey is\nsystem restore turned on?\n\n153\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.128\nNotice it says create a restore\npoint on right now for\n\n154\n00:07:46.128 --> 00:07:48.798\nthe drives that have system\nprotection turned on.\n\n155\n00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:52.648\nThat's the caveat there If it's turned\noff, you won't be able to create these.\n\n156\n00:07:52.648 --> 00:07:56.858\nSo if I do say create,\nwe can just call this, I don't know,\n\n157\n00:07:56.858 --> 00:08:01.260\nlet's call it A+ Demo again\ncuz I am very creative.\n\n158\n00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.440\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do, we'll choose Create,\n\n159\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.340\nit will take a second.\n\n160\n00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.710\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nlook at things like your registry and\n\n161\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.890\nyour system files, where the driver\nstates are, applications that you have,\n\n162\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.750\nand their settings, and it's going to make\na snapshot of it, through shadow copy.\n\n163\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.770\nThen what happens is let's say\nyou install that application,\n\n164\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.050\nyou restart your computer, and\nsomething starts going a little haywire or\n\n165\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.810\nyou're not exactly sure\nwhat you can do to fix it.\n\n166\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.242\nWell, you could start by just uninstalling\nthe application, sometimes that fixes it,\n\n167\n00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:30.501\nit's just the application\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n168\n00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:33.732\nBut however, you're an administrator and\nthe UAC prompts you and\n\n169\n00:08:33.732 --> 00:08:37.657\nyou installed that, chances are you've\nmade a modification of the registry and\n\n170\n00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:40.960\nwhat you have to come in here and\ndo is run System Restore.\n\n171\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.150\nAnd when you run System Restore, it\nallows you to walk through the Wizard and\n\n172\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.261\nyou can point it to the restore point.\n\n173\n00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:51.188\nYou can tell, hey, Wizard,\nthis is the restore point that I want and\n\n174\n00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:55.420\nessentially you can restore it\nto an earlier point in time.\n\n175\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.515\nNow when you restore it to the earlier\npoint in time, keep in mind,\n\n176\n00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:01.780\nif I create a restore point like I did\nright now and I install drivers and\n\n177\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.464\nan application then restore\nto an earlier point in time.\n\n178\n00:09:04.464 --> 00:09:08.105\nWhat's gonna happen is it's uninstall that\napplication as well as those drivers.\n\n179\n00:09:09.285 --> 00:09:11.145\nSo one of the things\nthat I will recommend,\n\n180\n00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:13.415\nin fact, if we go back to\nmy screen here real quick.\n\n181\n00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:15.645\nLet me show you something cuz I\ndidn't mention it kinda come up but\n\n182\n00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:17.115\nI didn't really point it out.\n\n183\n00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:19.645\nNotice this Scan for affected programs?\n\n184\n00:09:19.645 --> 00:09:22.374\nI infected, effected, affected programs.\n\n185\n00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:24.990\nIt's not malware system.\n\n186\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:30.280\nNotice it's gonna scan for drivers and\nprograms, again that might be uninstalled\n\n187\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.720\nor potentially reinstalled,\nwhen it comes to drivers.\n\n188\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.790\nNotice it said these are the drivers\nthat will be deleted,\n\n189\n00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.550\nthese are the drivers\nthat might be restored.\n\n190\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.010\nSo again, you do want to run that.\n\n191\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.920\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel out of this\nand hopefully it'll shut down for me.\n\n192\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.040\nBut as it's cancelling out here, just\nkeep in mind that you do wanna run that.\n\n193\n00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.060\nAnd the reason you wanna run that is\nbecause you wanna be aware of maybe any\n\n194\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.800\ndrivers that you might have to reinstall.\n\n195\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.515\nLet's say you installed one driver,\nand that'll create a restore point.\n\n196\n00:09:57.515 --> 00:10:00.526\nAnd then you went out and\ngot a third party manufacturer driver and\n\n197\n00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:01.521\nyou installed that.\n\n198\n00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:02.815\nWell, guess what?\n\n199\n00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:04.515\nIf you restored to\nthe earlier point in time,\n\n200\n00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:06.228\nyou're gonna delete both of those drivers.\n\n201\n00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:09.235\nAnd you might have to\njust be aware of that and\n\n202\n00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:14.783\nreinstall the one driver that maybe wasn't\nproblematic and you wanted to keep.\n\n203\n00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:18.064\nSo moving on, we have also\nsomething known as ReadyBoost.\n\n204\n00:10:18.064 --> 00:10:19.979\nWhen we talked about ReadyBoost,\n\n205\n00:10:19.979 --> 00:10:24.613\nReadyBoost is something that came out in\nVista and it was kept around in Windows 7.\n\n206\n00:10:24.613 --> 00:10:28.762\nAnd what this will allow you to do\nessentially is take a USB thumb drive and\n\n207\n00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:32.095\nplugin in your machine and\ntreat that thumb drive as though\n\n208\n00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:35.518\nit was an additional system RAM or\na system memory, if you.\n\n209\n00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:38.969\n&gt;&gt; So kind of a module swap\nfile that you can use.\n\n210\n00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:40.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really what it is,\n\n211\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.570\nit's saying, hey I'm just gonna allow\nyou to use this flash media here and\n\n212\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.890\nyou can start to use that as\nadditional system memory.\n\n213\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.570\nCuz if you think about it,\none of the problems, well,\n\n214\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.642\none of the many problems with Vista\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:10:50.642 --> 00:10:51.771\n&gt;&gt; Was that it was very\n\n216\n00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:53.260\nresource-intensive.\n\n217\n00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.110\nAnd when you jumped from\nan operating system, let's say,\n\n218\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:03.445\nlike XP that required,\nif I remember right, I should know this,\n\n219\n00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:07.617\n256 megs of RAM were\nthe minimum requirements,\n\n220\n00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:10.836\nthe recommended requirements for XP.\n\n221\n00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.590\nWe have gigs in systems today.\n\n222\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:20.192\nAnd when Windows Vista came out,\nit required 1 gig to run painfully slow.\n\n223\n00:11:20.192 --> 00:11:22.808\nSo you can see it was very\nresource intensive so\n\n224\n00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:26.764\nwhat they gave you the ability to do\nis take a thumb drive, plug it in and\n\n225\n00:11:26.764 --> 00:11:31.085\nyou could configure it to use ReadyBoost\nas a portion of additional memory.\n\n226\n00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:35.738\nAgain, but any kind of memory that you\ninstall in the mother board is going to be\n\n227\n00:11:35.738 --> 00:11:39.404\na lot faster and much more efficient\nwhen it comes to using that\n\n228\n00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:43.793\nthan any kind of ReadyBoost technology,\nbut it did give you the ability.\n\n229\n00:11:43.793 --> 00:11:47.902\nNow, the other thing you also have to keep\nin mind is that when you are going to do\n\n230\n00:11:47.902 --> 00:11:51.828\nthings like upgrades, especially when\nyou’re going to go from edition,\n\n231\n00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:55.008\nnot edition but\nversions of your Windows Operating System,\n\n232\n00:11:55.008 --> 00:11:57.960\nsometimes you have to\nworry about compatibility.\n\n233\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.259\nCompatibility is always a consideration\nbecause you might have applications\n\n234\n00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:08.314\nthat when you go from one version of\nWindows to the next version of Windows,\n\n235\n00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:11.461\nyou don't know if that\nedition of Windows is.\n\n236\n00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:12.260\nI keep saying edition.\n\n237\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.157\nRemember editions are like the difference\nbetween Pro, Ultimate, and Enterprise.\n\n238\n00:12:16.157 --> 00:12:19.420\nA version is the difference between Vista,\nWindows 7 and Windows 8.\n\n239\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.435\nLet me just be clear on that.\n\n240\n00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:25.915\nBut if I go from something like Vista to\nWindows 8.1 and I have an application.\n\n241\n00:12:25.915 --> 00:12:28.725\nMaybe I still got the DVD or\nthe CD that it came on.\n\n242\n00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:31.725\nI'm like, yeah, I wanna go ahead and\nplug that in to the Windows 8 machine.\n\n243\n00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:35.135\nThere's no real guarantee that\nthat application is gonna run, or\n\n244\n00:12:35.135 --> 00:12:36.705\nthat it's even supported.\n\n245\n00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:38.420\nYou might have to upgrade the application.\n\n246\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:44.312\nBut at least you have some abilities that\nif you still need to use that application,\n\n247\n00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:49.990\nyou could do some things like maybe\nrun something like compatibility mode.\n\n248\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.420\nWell, there's a couple\nof different things,\n\n249\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.260\nhonestly, that you could potentially do.\n\n250\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.880\nOne of the things that you\ncould do is the fact that\n\n251\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.510\nyou could run in what's\nknown as compatibility mode.\n\n252\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.910\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n253\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.160\nLet me take, let's see,\nI'm not sure if solitaire.\n\n254\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.370\nI'm just gonna take one of these here and\nlet me create a shortcut on the desktop.\n\n255\n00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.540\nThat's previous versions.\n\n256\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.410\nNo, that's not going to do it.\n\n257\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.870\nI'll tell you what,\nlet me see if I can fix this real quick.\n\n258\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.030\nLooks like we don't have\nany location to share.\n\n259\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.512\nI can change this real quick here.\n\n260\n00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:28.790\nThere we go, let's see if that works.\n\n261\n00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.920\nAll right and\nthat little setting seems to fix it.\n\n262\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.310\nIf we get into Documents here and\n\n263\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.280\nwhat I basically just want to do\nis kinda show you an application.\n\n264\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.660\nI'll pull just an application\nof the desktop.\n\n265\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.560\nWell there wouldn't be really a guarantee\nthat this application was gonna\n\n266\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.590\nrun correctly.\n\n267\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.354\nSo if I right-click on it and\nI choose Properties,\n\n268\n00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:49.549\nyou'll notice that there's something\ncalled the Compatibility tab here.\n\n269\n00:13:49.549 --> 00:13:51.101\nAnd if I choose Compatibility tab,\n\n270\n00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:54.900\nit gives me the ability to run something\nknown as the Compatibility mode.\n\n271\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.850\nSo for instance,\nI can put a check in this check box and\n\n272\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.710\nI could potentially run this as far back,\nthat's kinda interesting, Windows 95.\n\n273\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.270\nSo again, you do have the ability\nto run an application\n\n274\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.060\nin the context of an earlier\noperating system should you need to.\n\n275\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.550\nThat's one of the fixes that you have.\n\n276\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.650\nThe other thing that you also have\nis when they came out with Vista,\n\n277\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.880\nthey had what's known\nas the Windows XP mode.\n\n278\n00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.840\nWindows 7 has a Windows XP mode, and\n\n279\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.740\nwhat that would do is that would create\nan entire virtualized interface.\n\n280\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.190\nBasically it would sandbox this and\nit would really come up, and\n\n281\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.500\nit would look almost like any\nother window on your desktop.\n\n282\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.490\nAnd it would really be a completely\nseparated XP environment.\n\n283\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.860\nYou could load the application\nin that XP environment and\n\n284\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.420\npotentially can fix the problem there.\n\n285\n00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.935\nBecause if the application wasn't\nexpecting the user account control,\n\n286\n00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:50.149\nthat broke a lot of applications\nwhen that came out.\n\n287\n00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:52.770\nIt would allow you the ability\nto run it in the context of XP.\n\n288\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.250\nSo also understand what XP mode is.\n\n289\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.820\nToday, we don't have XP mode.\n\n290\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.136\nThat's kind of gone by the wayside\nwith things like Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n291\n00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:04.520\nWe no longer have that as well.\n\n292\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.620\nSome of the other things we have, we have\nsome different security functionalities\n\n293\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.630\nand features that you need to be aware of.\n\n294\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:16.590\nOne of those is gonna be well,\nwe have the Windows Firewall and Defender.\n\n295\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.550\nThis is something that\nwe also have to look at.\n\n296\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.390\nSo let's go ahead and\nwill open up our Control Panel again here\n\n297\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.830\nfrom the Start menu, we'll get to\nthe Control Panel, we'll go to System and\n\n298\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.080\nSecurity, and\nyou have the Windows Firewall.\n\n299\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.518\nJust remember that the firewall,\nwhat it allows you to do is basically\n\n300\n00:15:32.518 --> 00:15:35.668\ncontrol what programs could\ncommunicate with your computer and\n\n301\n00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.541\nwhat types of communications\ncan go out of your computer.\n\n302\n00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:42.062\nIf you want the really short,\nshort version, understand that firewalls\n\n303\n00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:45.870\ntypically by default, especially\nthe Windows Firewall will block everything\n\n304\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.587\ncoming into the firewall, will allow\neverything going out of the firewall.\n\n305\n00:15:49.587 --> 00:15:52.369\n&gt;&gt; If you need to make\nan exception to that rule,\n\n306\n00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:55.296\nall you would do is go up\nhere to allow a program or\n\n307\n00:15:55.296 --> 00:16:00.152\nfeature through the firewall and this\nwould give you the abilities provided.\n\n308\n00:16:00.152 --> 00:16:05.099\nYou have the administrative credential,\nyou can run as an administrator to change\n\n309\n00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:08.644\nwhat programs you allow to\ncommunicate into the firewall.\n\n310\n00:16:08.644 --> 00:16:12.787\nNow you could get a little bit more\nadvanced with that firewall if you\n\n311\n00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:13.441\nwanted and\n\n312\n00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:18.384\nyou could do a lot more granular controls\nby choosing the advanced settings, and\n\n313\n00:16:18.384 --> 00:16:23.253\nthat would load up a separate Windows\nFirewall which would be a Windows Firewall\n\n314\n00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:28.365\nwith Advanced Security, and this allows\nyou to create your own individual rules.\n\n315\n00:16:28.365 --> 00:16:31.628\nA rule says, this is allowed or\nthis is denied.\n\n316\n00:16:31.628 --> 00:16:34.553\nIn bound to your computer means\ncoming into your computer.\n\n317\n00:16:34.553 --> 00:16:38.111\nOutbound means coming out of your\ncomputer as well as some more advanced\n\n318\n00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:41.968\nconfigurations like internet protocol\nsecurity which I don't believe that\n\n319\n00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:43.983\nyou'll have to worry for this exam, but\n\n320\n00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:47.330\nremember that Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security is there.\n\n321\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.180\nOther things that we have as well, we have\nsomething known as well Windows Defender.\n\n322\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.360\nIf I go up to the category view,\nyou say, well, category view.\n\n323\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.601\nWhat does it mean?\n\n324\n00:16:56.601 --> 00:17:00.083\nWell, in Windows Vista and prior,\nthey have what's known as classic view and\n\n325\n00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:01.953\nthey have what's know as category view.\n\n326\n00:17:01.953 --> 00:17:04.595\nWhen Windows 7 came out,\nthey kept category view and\n\n327\n00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:07.248\nthey changed that rather\nthan staying classic view.\n\n328\n00:17:07.248 --> 00:17:09.738\nThey say, large icons and small icons.\n\n329\n00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:13.990\nThe classic view which what\na lot of people got used to and\n\n330\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.697\nwould see, and kinda wanted to\nbe able to change their control\n\n331\n00:17:18.697 --> 00:17:22.694\npanel back to was basically\nseeing all of the icons.\n\n332\n00:17:22.694 --> 00:17:24.888\nThat's what was known as classic view.\n\n333\n00:17:24.888 --> 00:17:28.505\nWindows Vista would be the last\noperating system that you see that term,\n\n334\n00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:29.285\nclassic view.\n\n335\n00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:34.277\nWhen they went into Windows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows 8.1, they changed it from category\n\n336\n00:17:34.277 --> 00:17:38.837\nview which categories all the utilities\nbased on whatever their functionality is.\n\n337\n00:17:38.837 --> 00:17:43.357\nAnd they changed it to the classic view is\njust hey, we're gonna call these icons now\n\n338\n00:17:43.357 --> 00:17:46.363\nand do you want large icons or\ndo you want on small icons.\n\n339\n00:17:46.363 --> 00:17:51.435\nNow scrolling down, we'll see that not\nonly do we have the Windows Firewall here,\n\n340\n00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:53.616\nbut we also have Windows Defender.\n\n341\n00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:57.111\nWindows Defender is an anti-malware\ntype technology and\n\n342\n00:17:57.111 --> 00:18:01.115\nwhat this allows you to do,\nbasically, h, and it's turned off.\n\n343\n00:18:01.115 --> 00:18:03.285\nLet's go ahead and well, you know what?\n\n344\n00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:07.753\nThis is a great segue, cuz we also\nhave to talk about the Action Center.\n\n345\n00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.997\nThe Action Center is something that\nis also in your control panel.\n\n346\n00:18:10.997 --> 00:18:15.906\nLet's go ahead and see if we can turn\nit on from here and out of data.\n\n347\n00:18:15.906 --> 00:18:16.498\nThat's okay.\n\n348\n00:18:16.498 --> 00:18:18.880\nWe'll take care of that\nin a later episode.\n\n349\n00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.060\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, I think that where you\nclicked was behind your head.\n\n350\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n351\n00:18:23.678 --> 00:18:25.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwas it in the bottom right hand corner?\n\n352\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, that was letting me know\nthat the malware definitions are out of\n\n353\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.325\ndate and we haven't updated those.\n\n354\n00:18:29.325 --> 00:18:32.496\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna save\nthat for our trouble shooting section,\n\n355\n00:18:32.496 --> 00:18:35.139\nbecause one of the things that we\nhave to do is patch management and\n\n356\n00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:36.359\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n357\n00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:39.645\nSo we'll go ahead and show you how to\nupdate those, but what he was talking\n\n358\n00:18:39.645 --> 00:18:42.613\nabout, a little thought bubble that\ncomes up in the background and\n\n359\n00:18:42.613 --> 00:18:43.940\nI don't know if it's still.\n\n360\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.917\nNo, I don't think it's still there.\n\n361\n00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:48.487\nBut it came up in what's known as the\nnotification area there on the taskbar.\n\n362\n00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:49.960\nSo yeah, definitely.\n\n363\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.283\nAgain, Windows Defender, you can see that\nwe should be checking for new definitions.\n\n364\n00:18:54.283 --> 00:18:57.463\nWe're gonna save that for\nour troubleshooting sections and\n\n365\n00:18:57.463 --> 00:19:00.024\nstuff like that,\nbecause you need to know that.\n\n366\n00:19:00.024 --> 00:19:04.039\nBut it basically allows me the ability\nto run scans on my computer and\n\n367\n00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:08.769\nscan locations for different pieces of\nmalware, viruses and stuff like that.\n\n368\n00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:11.185\nSo, great utility to have.\n\n369\n00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:12.761\nNow, I did mention the Action Center.\n\n370\n00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:16.362\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel out of this\nand I'm gonna go back to Category view.\n\n371\n00:19:16.362 --> 00:19:20.621\nBecause in earlier days when I would\ngo in Vista more specifically,\n\n372\n00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:25.045\nyou'd notice that the category view said,\nsystem and maintenance.\n\n373\n00:19:25.045 --> 00:19:26.518\nIt didn't say, System and Security.\n\n374\n00:19:26.518 --> 00:19:30.438\nAnd when I click system and maintenance\nin Vista at the top of the screen,\n\n375\n00:19:30.438 --> 00:19:32.946\nyou have something called\nsecurity center and\n\n376\n00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:37.203\nsecurity center would allow you to\nreview common security centric settings.\n\n377\n00:19:37.203 --> 00:19:41.623\nWhen Vista came out and continued on or\nexcuse me, when Windows 7 came out and\n\n378\n00:19:41.623 --> 00:19:46.052\ncontinued on in Windows 8 and 8.1,\nthey changed it to the Action Center.\n\n379\n00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:48.104\nAnd when you go to\nAction Center now today,\n\n380\n00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:51.644\nif you'll notice this is where all\nthe security related information is.\n\n381\n00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:54.115\nNotice I have, it's telling me, hey,\n\n382\n00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:57.533\nyou might want to make sure\nthat your Windows Defender or\n\n383\n00:19:57.533 --> 00:20:03.082\nMicrosoft Security Essentials are, they're\nout of date, you might wanna update them.\n\n384\n00:20:03.082 --> 00:20:05.736\nVirus protection, we wanna make\nsure that they're up to date.\n\n385\n00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:09.806\nSo again, security information as\nwell as maintenance information too.\n\n386\n00:20:09.806 --> 00:20:14.670\nWindows Update, it's trying to connect out\nto Windows Update and pull-down patches.\n\n387\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.410\nAnd unfortunately right now,\nit can't do that.\n\n388\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:21.678\nAgain, we're gonna show you some\npost-installation configurations\n\n389\n00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:27.300\nthat you have to do once the operating\nsystem is installed in a later episode.\n\n390\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.043\nSo that's got some of the things\nthat you need to know, as well.\n\n391\n00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:34.367\nThe other thing that we need to know\nabout is something known as the Metro UI.\n\n392\n00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:37.614\nThey call it the Metro UI or\na modern UI and let me go ahead, and\n\n393\n00:20:37.614 --> 00:20:41.268\nwhat we'll do is we'll switch\nover to our Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n394\n00:20:41.268 --> 00:20:46.650\nNow, Windows 8.1 looks a lot different\nthan our traditional Windows desktop.\n\n395\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.458\nIn fact,\nwhen I log in to this operating system,\n\n396\n00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:53.430\none of the things that you'll notice\nis you have this start screen and\n\n397\n00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.985\nthe start screen is\na tile based interface.\n\n398\n00:20:55.985 --> 00:20:56.673\nOops, there we go.\n\n399\n00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:57.426\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n400\n00:20:57.426 --> 00:21:02.425\nTiled based interface and you'll see that\nyou have all these different apps that\n\n401\n00:21:02.425 --> 00:21:05.012\nwe can load up potentially, if you want.\n\n402\n00:21:05.012 --> 00:21:07.332\nWe can make modifications to them.\n\n403\n00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:09.602\nWe can unpin them from the start screen,\nif we want.\n\n404\n00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.974\nIf I unpin, they go away.\n\n405\n00:21:11.974 --> 00:21:14.398\nI can also resize them, if I want.\n\n406\n00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:17.134\nIf I say, hey,\nthat's taking up too much of the start,\n\n407\n00:21:17.134 --> 00:21:18.892\nthe modern UI is what it's called.\n\n408\n00:21:18.892 --> 00:21:20.164\nHere's where it gets a little tricky.\n\n409\n00:21:20.164 --> 00:21:22.877\nIn the exam objectives,\nthey still call it the Metro UI.\n\n410\n00:21:22.877 --> 00:21:28.286\nBut not to long after it came out the re\nchanged, they named it the modern UI.\n\n411\n00:21:28.286 --> 00:21:31.632\nSo I might go back and\nforth on that terminology today,\n\n412\n00:21:31.632 --> 00:21:33.860\nit's called the modern UI.\n\n413\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.888\nBut if I decide that hey, that's taking up\ntoo much real estate on the start screen,\n\n414\n00:21:37.888 --> 00:21:38.699\nI can change it.\n\n415\n00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:42.178\nIf it happens to be what's known as\na live tile, giving you live information.\n\n416\n00:21:42.178 --> 00:21:46.155\nYou can also right-click\non the start screen and\n\n417\n00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:48.871\nturn off the live tile, as well.\n\n418\n00:21:48.871 --> 00:21:51.455\nSo you do have that option and\nI can say, hey,\n\n419\n00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:56.297\nI don't wanna get any of these updates and\nyou'll notice it quits using resources.\n\n420\n00:21:56.297 --> 00:22:01.537\nHowever, I also have what are known as\ncharms that Windows 8.1 introduced.\n\n421\n00:22:01.537 --> 00:22:04.238\nAnd if I hover over\nthe right side of my screen,\n\n422\n00:22:04.238 --> 00:22:06.749\nmy hand's covering up some of the charms.\n\n423\n00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:10.601\nWe also have these quick launch items,\nicons if you will.\n\n424\n00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:14.631\nAnd again, they're called charms and\nthat takes me into the different PC\n\n425\n00:22:14.631 --> 00:22:18.869\nsettings that also takes me into basically\nthe modern UI type applications.\n\n426\n00:22:18.869 --> 00:22:21.407\nAgain, you can see they're\nkinda full screened here.\n\n427\n00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:23.765\nBut again,\nyou do have the ability to do that.\n\n428\n00:22:23.765 --> 00:22:27.717\nIf I'm up in the upper right hands,\nI think I might have said left-hand side.\n\n429\n00:22:27.717 --> 00:22:29.027\nCharms are on the right-hand side.\n\n430\n00:22:29.027 --> 00:22:33.551\nOn the left hand-side,\nwe have the quick launch window.\n\n431\n00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:34.544\nSo if I hover over that,\n\n432\n00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:37.187\nyou'll notice that I kinda\nshowing you another application.\n\n433\n00:22:37.187 --> 00:22:37.997\nWell, what is that?\n\n434\n00:22:37.997 --> 00:22:39.249\nWell, that's actually my desktop.\n\n435\n00:22:39.249 --> 00:22:43.371\nAnd you can see, you can do this\nkind of fast switching between\n\n436\n00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:48.224\nthe traditional desktop and your modern\nUI or Metro UI like they call it.\n\n437\n00:22:48.224 --> 00:22:51.178\nSo, those are a couple things\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n438\n00:22:51.178 --> 00:22:52.115\nLet's see here, Dan.\n\n439\n00:22:52.115 --> 00:22:55.646\nI know we're running a little\nbit short on time here.\n\n440\n00:22:55.646 --> 00:23:00.427\nWe might save the installation for part\nthree here and just kinda run through some\n\n441\n00:23:00.427 --> 00:23:05.067\nof those installations here, but a couple\nmore features that I wanna take care\n\n442\n00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:08.460\nof is something known as PowerShell and\nCommand Prompt.\n\n443\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.662\nNow, we're gonna take you back to\nthe earlier days of computing when\n\n444\n00:23:14.662 --> 00:23:19.580\nyou didn't get the nice pretty little\ngraphical user interfaces that\n\n445\n00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.765\nwe have been utilizing\nhere in this episode.\n\n446\n00:23:22.765 --> 00:23:25.170\nOne of the things that Windows\nkind of revolutionized.\n\n447\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.747\nAnd again, I keep saying revolutionized.\n\n448\n00:23:26.747 --> 00:23:29.615\nThey grabbed it and they ran with,\nand they kinda made it real pretty.\n\n449\n00:23:29.615 --> 00:23:30.952\n&gt;&gt; They popularized it.\n\n450\n00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:31.995\n&gt;&gt; There we go, great.\n\n451\n00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:34.690\nYes, absolutely.\n\n452\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.899\nIs that that graphical user interface.\n\n453\n00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:42.843\nThe earlier days of computing and\neven people like Dan who still are using\n\n454\n00:23:42.843 --> 00:23:47.547\noperating systems like Linux utilize\nanother type of interactive,\n\n455\n00:23:47.547 --> 00:23:49.184\nif you will interface.\n\n456\n00:23:49.184 --> 00:23:53.730\nBut it doesn't have all the flashy\nnature here and that's called a shell,\n\n457\n00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.534\na terminal.\n\n458\n00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:58.310\nIn Windows, we call it command prompt or\nPowerShell.\n\n459\n00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.730\nPowerShell is a newer technology.\n\n460\n00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.940\nCommand Prompt's been inside of Windows.\n\n461\n00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.690\nIn the earlier days, it was called DOS.\n\n462\n00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.650\nIn your Linux operating systems and even\nyour Mac and your Unix operating systems,\n\n463\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.560\nthey call it a terminal or a shell.\n\n464\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.340\nLet me go ahead and show you here.\n\n465\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.120\nOn the task bar,\nI actually have Command Prompt.\n\n466\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.200\nYou can also get to Command Prompt\nby pushing Start, All Programs,\n\n467\n00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.530\nif you go to Accessories,\nyou can see Command Prompt.\n\n468\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.900\nIf I am on, if I'm looking for PowerShell,\n\n469\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.250\nI could go to Control Panel, System and\nSecurity, Administrative Tools.\n\n470\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.740\nAnd you'll see I have the PowerShell\nmodules there as well.\n\n471\n00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.880\nIf you're in your Windows 8.1 machine,\nyou can go to your start screen and\n\n472\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.755\ntype in three letters, CMD,\nor type Command prompt.\n\n473\n00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:48.640\nAnd we can see that we can\nlaunch it up here, and\n\n474\n00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.080\nyou get this basically text\nbased interface, right.\n\n475\n00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.500\nAnd that's one of the things to keep\nin mind with your command prompt,\n\n476\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.410\nis text based input, text based output.\n\n477\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.380\nNow we're gonna have an episode that\nessentially is gonna show you all of these\n\n478\n00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.140\ncommands.\n\n479\n00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.270\nHowever, you do want to know that you're\nessentially working with Windows.\n\n480\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.870\nThat's important, right?\n\n481\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.560\nThis is Windows that you're working with.\n\n482\n00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.848\nThis is just Windows without the GUI.\n\n483\n00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:18.640\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's taking\nthe training wheels off, as it were,\n\n484\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.710\nallowing you to actually dive in,\ngo old school like Wes alluded to.\n\n485\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.020\nAnd myself, I enjoy that.\n\n486\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.530\nI like having that hands-on experience\nwhen it comes to my operating systems.\n\n487\n00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.040\nAnd when I want to do that\ninside of a Windows environment,\n\n488\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.250\nthis is where I'll tend to go.\n\n489\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nPowerShell is just an upgraded.\n\n490\n00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.540\nI say upgraded,\nthere's a lot of differences between it.\n\n491\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.630\nIt is also text-based.\n\n492\n00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.810\nLet me see if I can still launch\nPowerShell from the command prompt.\n\n493\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.940\nI believe I can.\n\n494\n00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.041\nOkay, yeah, well that didn't really help\nbecause it doesn't look much different.\n\n495\n00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:48.280\nSo people are like,\nwell that's all I do is change the text.\n\n496\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.370\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n497\n00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.740\nIf I go to System and Security,\nAdministrative Tools, and we go down to\n\n498\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.780\nPowerShell modules, all right, here's\nthat User Account Control, by the way.\n\n499\n00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.810\nIt's letting me know, hey,\n\n500\n00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.180\nyou can make some modifications\nto your operating system.\n\n501\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.080\nAre you an administrator and\ndid you launch this?\n\n502\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.800\nThat's one of the great things about\nthe User Account Control is that it does\n\n503\n00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.610\nprotect you.\n\n504\n00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:14.520\nAnd you have to be inside of\nyour PowerShell interface.\n\n505\n00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.140\nAll right, so\nthis is essentially is PowerShell, and\n\n506\n00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.950\nlet me back up and\nmake sure that I said that right.\n\n507\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:27.150\nUser Account Control is saying hey, if you\nenter into the PowerShell User Interface,\n\n508\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:32.110\nyou can make modifications that you\nmight not be able to come back from and\n\n509\n00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.510\npotential changes to the operating\nsystem that really require\n\n510\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.280\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n511\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.140\nSo just make sure I state that right.\n\n512\n00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.240\nAnd you can see here, guys and gals,\n\n513\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.790\nit's nothing different than a text based\ninterface, right, where we essentially\n\n514\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.930\nenter, not commands, as they're called,\nlike they're called in Command Prompt.\n\n515\n00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:55.460\nWe end up typing what are known\nas cmdlts and they're verb, noun,\n\n516\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.520\nsyntax right we have get location.\n\n517\n00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.030\nAnd if I do that, that essentially shows\nme that I'm in C: here in the file\n\n518\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:09.188\nhierarchy, versus commands that I would\nenter in the Command Prompt would\n\n519\n00:27:09.188 --> 00:27:13.730\nbe like a dir command, and that would show\nme the location that I'm currently in, and\n\n520\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.542\nin that case, notice that\nPowerShell has me in C:\\, right?\n\n521\n00:27:17.542 --> 00:27:19.780\nThat is the root of the drive,\n\n522\n00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.600\nversus Command Prompt here is\nstarting me off in my user profile,\n\n523\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.480\nand that's C:\\Users\\administrators,\nright, where all the user profiles are.\n\n524\n00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.740\nSo those are a couple of the features\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n525\n00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.640\nThe last one that I'll mention is\nsomething that has been around for\n\n526\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.870\na little bit, used to be called\nLiveDrive and was changed to OneDrive.\n\n527\n00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.740\nThat's what it is still today.\n\n528\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.830\nAnd this really was a feature that they\nintegrated to the Windows 8 operating\n\n529\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.930\nsystem and 8.1, it's a Cloud based\nsolution that allows you to store your\n\n530\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.640\ndata, well you store it locally still but\nyou can also store it on Microsoft servers\n\n531\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.040\nand they give you a certain amount of free\nspace, I can't remember what it is now,\n\n532\n00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.110\nI think it's five gigs at this point,\nbut you can also purchase more.\n\n533\n00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.350\nAnd it allows you to do Cloud based\nsynchronization like we'll talk about in\n\n534\n00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.020\nsome of our mobile operating systems.\n\n535\n00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.750\nBasically, taking your data and\nsynchronizing it up to the Cloud so\n\n536\n00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.192\nthat if you log into another Windows 8 or\n8.1 machine,\n\n537\n00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:18.480\nyou can pull that information down to the\nCloud and put it on that machine as well.\n\n538\n00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.600\nSo, it's a great way to\ndo things like backups,\n\n539\n00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.270\ndo file synchronization as well and\nif you have to move your data between\n\n540\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.390\nmultiple computers that you own,\nthey give you the ability to do that.\n\n541\n00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.420\nSo OneDrive is another\none of those features\n\n542\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.820\nthat you're gonna have to know for\nthat A+ exam.\n\n543\n00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well, I know we have a\nlittle bit of the installation stuff to go\n\n544\n00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.080\nthrough, but like you said,\nwe'll have to move that to a part three.\n\n545\n00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.590\nGreat stuff, great information\nin this episode so far, though.\n\n546\n00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:47.000\nI really enjoy your presentation and your\npassion behind the technologies as well.\n\n547\n00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.710\nThat being said, as you can, well,\nprobably guess, we are out of time for\n\n548\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.780\nthis episode.\n\n549\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.260\nWe will back for Part 3, so join us there.\n\n550\n00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.250\nAs for this one,\nlet's go ahead and call it a day.\n\n551\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n552\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.030\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n553\n00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.295\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n554\n00:29:02.295 --> 00:29:08.191\n[MUSIC]\n\n555\n00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:10.070\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.230\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.988\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:13.509\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.690\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.010\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.000\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore in our A+ Accelerated Series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.500\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nhe's driving the wheel,\n\n10\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.690\nputting the pedal into the metal,\nour good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.280\nWes, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.560\nGreat to be here as always,\nthat's right, we've been talking\n\n14\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.970\nabout Windows features and\ninstallation in the first two episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.540\nWe've talked a lot about things like well,\nthe different versions of Windows,\n\n16\n00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710\nyou know the difference between Windows,\nVista, 7 if you will, 8 and 8.1.\n\n17\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860\nWe talked about the editions, too.\n\n18\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.350\nKeep in mind, within each version of\nWindows they have different editions that\n\n19\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.550\nlend themselves to\na different set of features.\n\n20\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.850\nWe also talked pretty extensively about\nthe different features that you can see\n\n21\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.220\nwith inside of Windows as well.\n\n22\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.070\nAnd it's interesting, across every\none of those titles also talks about\n\n23\n00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540\ninstallations, and guess what we haven't\ntalked about at all, our installation.\n\n24\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.290\nSo that's what we hope to pretty much\nround out this little trilogy that we're\n\n25\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920\nin here when it comes\nto Windows in general.\n\n26\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.810\nInside of, well, basically installing\nyour Windows operating systems.\n\n27\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.900\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout installations in general.\n\n28\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.380\nAll right, one of the things that you have\nto know is boot methods they call out.\n\n29\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.240\nNow we'll talk about\ninstallation methods and\n\n30\n00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.220\nwe're gonna talk about boot\nmethods as well, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.740\nSo what is booting, right?\n\n32\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.780\nWhat does a boot method mean?\n\n33\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.040\nWell if I'm going to install the operating\nsystem, how am I gonna get the digital\n\n34\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.340\ndata that's on the installation\nmedia onto the computer so\n\n35\n00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.180\nthat it is now installed\non the local hard drive?\n\n36\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Osmosis.\n\n37\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n38\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.190\nI was thinking we can use our Chi, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.900\nSit criss cross applesauce,\nas my son likes to say.\n\n40\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.700\nBut well no, that might be a method for\nanother reality but\n\n41\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.260\nin this reality we do have to look at\nwell, we do have the traditional method.\n\n42\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.460\nThe traditional method\nbeing the optical drive.\n\n43\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.960\nSo we do,\nwe can use things like the optical drive.\n\n44\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.515\nNow I will tell you that with using the\noptical drive, one of the things that's\n\n45\n00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:12.800\nbecoming almost less and less popular and\nmaybe it's just not so popular, because\n\n46\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.705\nI'm into IT, Dan's in IT, and we see\noperating systems all the time, you know.\n\n47\n00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:22.560\nSo to us they're kind of, I mean,\nwe don't really see optical disks anymore.\n\n48\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.810\nIn fact, both of the MacBooks\nthat we have on us right now,\n\n49\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.660\nthey don't even have\nMacBook optical drives.\n\n50\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.950\nIn fact,\nthe last Windows machine that I had,\n\n51\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.260\nit didn't have an optical drive, right?\n\n52\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.650\nBut we have to mention it,\nit is a boot method, right?\n\n53\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640\nIt's taking an optical disk and\nplacing it into the optical tray.\n\n54\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.040\nPushing the drive in.\n\n55\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.340\nOr that might make another one of our\nhosts, Mike Rodrick, a little upset.\n\n56\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.140\nHe said, there's a button there for\na reason.\n\n57\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.640\nYou push the button and it basically\nallows you to boot to the optical drive\n\n58\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.780\nwhen you change the boot sequence\nwithin the BIOS of the computer,\n\n59\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.080\nor UEFI if you're talking about\nthe more modern type BIOS.\n\n60\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.545\nNow, that being said, understand that the\ncapacity of the installation data, right.\n\n61\n00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:06.195\nIt's typically in what's\nknow as an ISo format and\n\n62\n00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:09.845\nthat installation media typically\nneeds to be on a DVD today.\n\n63\n00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:14.245\nIn the earlier days, things like XP,\nyour installation source,\n\n64\n00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:18.165\nthe media itself, the data that's\nbasically going to be written to the hard\n\n65\n00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.340\ndrive was relatively small and\nit could fit on a CD.\n\n66\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.240\nThat's why XP and prior,\nyou would see on CDs.\n\n67\n00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.190\nHowever today, because of the size\nof that installation data there, and\n\n68\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.090\nagain from here on out we'll call it\ninstallation media is the fact that it\n\n69\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.190\nis typically no less than like 1.5 gigs,\nright?\n\n70\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.247\nI believe Vista started that out,\n1.5 gigs.\n\n71\n00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:46.300\nAnd I believe now, things like Windows\n8.1, you're talking up to 2 gigs or\n\n72\n00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.120\nso or maybe even 3 gigs by now.\n\n73\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.530\nSo CDs, 700 megabits,\nmegabyte capacity not megabit,\n\n74\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.690\nmegabyte capacity as you'll learn, you've\nlearned and will learn inside of our\n\n75\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.870\naccelerated when we talk about some of\nthe hardware so we need to go to DVDs.\n\n76\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.866\nThat is something that's\nimportant to understand,\n\n77\n00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:10.750\nthat CDs do not fit the capacity of\nthat installation media, I should say.\n\n78\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.290\nAll right, so\nthat's one of the boot methods.\n\n79\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.580\nOne of the other boot methods you\nhave are solid state installations.\n\n80\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.190\nAnd we say solid state installations,\n\n81\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.400\ndon't think of the internal\ndrive that we're talking about.\n\n82\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.360\nWhat we're talking about are USB drives,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.860\nUSB drives can be formatted, their\nexternal drives they can be formatted and\n\n84\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.640\nformatted in a way that they have a boot\npartition, a master boot record or\n\n85\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.380\nGPT, good partition table depending\non what BIOS platform you are.\n\n86\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.400\nAnd in your boot sequence,\nyou can point it to an external drive or\n\n87\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.310\na USB thumb drive.\n\n88\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.730\nAnd then you could load the installation\n\n89\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.320\ndata onto the local hard drive that way,\nright?\n\n90\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.300\nSo that's one of the options too.\n\n91\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.390\nThat would fall under an external drive.\n\n92\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.510\nThat would be a hot swappable drive and\nit's only hot swappable if you think about\n\n93\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.290\na USB because I can plug it,\nunplug it, right?\n\n94\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.960\nI don't have to open the case,\npower off the machine and\n\n95\n00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.230\nthen remove the drive,\nunlike an internal drive you would.\n\n96\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.740\nAll right, the other thing that you\nhave is what is known as the PXE boot.\n\n97\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.190\nNow PXE boot is interesting, this isn't\nsomething that's specific to Windows.\n\n98\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.810\nLet's just go out the gate with this and\n\n99\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.850\nunderstand that this is\na firmware specification.\n\n100\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.590\nI can't remember,\nI wanna say Intel might have started this,\n\n101\n00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.900\nbut it is a firmware specification and\nit is part of your Bios and\n\n102\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.660\nyour UEFI platforms and\nhas nothing to do with Windows, right?\n\n103\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.780\nIf Dan's spinning up a Linux server and\n\n104\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.099\nhe's going to put this Apache\nweb server on it, guess what?\n\n105\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.490\nIt's the hardware.\n\n106\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.340\nPXE boot is a hardware level thing,\n\n107\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.920\nit is regardless of whether\nyou're running Windows, Mac or\n\n108\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.270\nwhether you're running Linux or even\nUnix operating system for that matter.\n\n109\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.660\nSo what is PXE?\n\n110\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.180\nPre-execution environment.\n\n111\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.310\nWhen we talk about pre-execution\nenvironment it means that guess what,\n\n112\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.510\nwe don't have an operating system\nthat is loading into RAM and\n\n113\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.240\ncontrolling the hardware yet.\n\n114\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.450\nSo, what happens?\n\n115\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.960\nWell, let me go ahead and show you kinda\nwhat the PXE environment would look like.\n\n116\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.450\nI'm gonna go ahead and start this machine\nhere and one of the things it will do is,\n\n117\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.700\nit's gonna, oop, and you know what?\n\n118\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.280\nThat didn't work.\n\n119\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.950\nLet me go ahead and shut this down.\n\n120\n00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.490\nI actually got the installation\nmedia in the optical drive.\n\n121\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.470\nYeah, I found it, and\nthat's what it's supposed to do.\n\n122\n00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.185\nSo, it actually, darn computers\ndoing what we're telling them to.\n\n123\n00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Who would have thought?\n\n124\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.090\n&gt;&gt; I could not,\ni don't agree with you computer.\n\n125\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.710\n&gt;&gt; Can't you just.\n&gt;&gt; You're not supposed to do that.\n\n126\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Figure out what I want you do for real.\n\n127\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so let's try that again\nand like Dan said a swing and a miss.\n\n128\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.140\nSo now what we're going to do is we're\ngonna boot it up and let me go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.270\npause this before it fails.\n\n130\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.140\nSo what's going on here right now?\n\n131\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.540\nWell, I want you to see that it's\ndoing what's known as a network boot.\n\n132\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.610\nYou might hear that from time to time.\n\n133\n00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.320\nSometimes they short it.\n\n134\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.910\nThey call it a net boot\nin the exam objectives.\n\n135\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.940\nA network boot.\n\n136\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.650\nWhat is going on?\n\n137\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.880\nWell, it's the pre-execution environment\nthat's actually happening right here.\n\n138\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.910\nAnd what the network adapter is doing,\nnot the hard drive,\n\n139\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.910\nnot the operating system,\nthere is no operating system.\n\n140\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.230\nBut what happens is in a little bit\nof firmware on the network adapter,\n\n141\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.940\nor it could be built into\nyour motherboard as well,\n\n142\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.020\nif you have an integrated network adapter.\n\n143\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.070\nIt's basically allowing that\ninformation to run, that data to run.\n\n144\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.320\nAnd this machine is calling out to\nthe local network and it's saying,\n\n145\n00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.598\nI need an operating system, does anybody\nhave an operating system out there?\n\n146\n00:07:21.598 --> 00:07:23.660\nAgain, it's pre-execution environment,\n\n147\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.965\nwe don't have an operating system, that\nis actually running on this machine yet.\n\n148\n00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:31.962\nAnd if we can take a look at that screen\none more time, it's letting us know,\n\n149\n00:07:31.962 --> 00:07:35.709\nbecause it has to be a TCP/IP protocol\nstack that it's implementing,\n\n150\n00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:38.195\nit's gotta follow the rules, right?\n\n151\n00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:43.010\nIt's saying here's my Mac address and\nhere's this crazy long number.\n\n152\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.800\nDon't worry about this too much for\nthe exam.\n\n153\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.394\nBut just to kind of explain,\nthat's a GUID, globally unique identifier.\n\n154\n00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:50.001\nWe use those because\nsometimes MAC addresses,\n\n155\n00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.421\nwe used to say MAC addresses were so\nunique.\n\n156\n00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:56.087\nYou have billions and billions and\nbillions of combinations, but\n\n157\n00:07:56.087 --> 00:08:00.408\nMAC addresses do run into problems,\nespecially with virtualization today,\n\n158\n00:08:00.408 --> 00:08:02.970\nthat they're not as unique\nas they used to be.\n\n159\n00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.720\nSo this is a way that uniquely, let's say\n\n160\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.120\nthe sever that's out there that maybe\nhas an operating system for this device.\n\n161\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.578\nIt can say, I recognize you, here's your\nMAC address, that's the network adapter\n\n162\n00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.640\nand here's the unique instance\nof you calling and asking me.\n\n163\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.333\nSo I can identify, when I send that\ninformation out I know how to work with\n\n164\n00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:23.982\nwell, the ethernet standard.\n\n165\n00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:27.900\nI can send it over the local LAN\ncommunications, which is your MAC address.\n\n166\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.178\nAnd I can also identify you\nthis network adapter as well.\n\n167\n00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.077\nAll right, so\nthat's your globally unique identifier.\n\n168\n00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:38.350\nAnd you can see here that it says DHCP,\nright?\n\n169\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.237\nSo DHCP is saying, hey I'm gonna\ncall out to the network for you and\n\n170\n00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:49.190\nI'll try to get an IP address and I'll\ntry to basically get an operating system.\n\n171\n00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.540\nSo that's the PXE boot, right?\n\n172\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.670\nSo network boot, keep in mind that\nyou could have that likewise.\n\n173\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:01.846\nSo those are pretty much your main\npre-installation boot locations.\n\n174\n00:09:01.846 --> 00:09:04.707\nNow once you've already\ninstalled your operating system,\n\n175\n00:09:04.707 --> 00:09:08.130\nyour boot location is typically\nyour internal hard drive.\n\n176\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.763\nThe exception to the rule on that is,\nI gotta put this exception in there,\n\n177\n00:09:12.763 --> 00:09:17.473\nis when you have a server that has always\ngot an operating system waiting for\n\n178\n00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:20.188\nthese small slim-line devices, right?\n\n179\n00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:22.697\nSometimes they may not even\nhave any resources locally.\n\n180\n00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:26.380\nAnd what they do is every time\nthey boot up, they do a PXE boot.\n\n181\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.450\nAnd they say hey,\nI need an operating system.\n\n182\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.170\nDo you have one?\n\n183\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.680\nAnd I need a configuration file so I know\nhow to configure the operating system.\n\n184\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.990\nAnd they pull that down.\n\n185\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.560\nAnd it becomes what's known as\nbasically a remote installation.\n\n186\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.240\nAnytime an operating system's\npulled down over the network,\n\n187\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.860\nit's a remote or network installation.\n\n188\n00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.800\nAnd you can add text files\nTo make them what's known\n\n189\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.950\nas an unintended installation,\nand that's great, right?\n\n190\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.130\nIf I install my operating system,\nI won't have to go through some of\n\n191\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.060\nthe post configurations that we're\ngonna show you here, coming up.\n\n192\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.700\nNow when you do an installation\nof an operating system,\n\n193\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.250\nunderstand it's pretty basic, right?\n\n194\n00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.210\nThere's a few things that you have to be\naware of, that you have to know, hey.\n\n195\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.824\nThis is what's gonna go on.\n\n196\n00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:11.966\nBut one of the great things I have\nto say is the installation of\n\n197\n00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:15.515\nthe operating system,\nit really hasn't changed in Windows much.\n\n198\n00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.259\n&gt;&gt; It's gotten faster.\n\n199\n00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:18.649\n&gt;&gt; It has, absolutely.\n\n200\n00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:21.121\nAnd then you combine that with\nthings like solid state drives and\n\n201\n00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.460\nit makes it even faster than that.\n\n202\n00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.270\nAnd the fact that RAM is really fast\ntoday too gives you the ability to\n\n203\n00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.150\nreally do an installation\nabout five minutes at most.\n\n204\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.340\nWhat is really gets you though\nis the post-installation\n\n205\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.180\nstuff that you have to do.\n\n206\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.100\nAnd that can take a while.\n\n207\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.830\nAnd you're going to see coming up\nhere in a bit, we will show you.\n\n208\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.450\nNow, let me go ahead and\nwhat we're going kinda do is,\n\n209\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.210\nwe want to kinda show you how\nthe installation process will work.\n\n210\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.110\nSo, if we can take a look\nat my computer here.\n\n211\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.210\nLet me go ahead and what I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to start this machine.\n\n212\n00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.995\nAnd we're hoping now,\nwatch it not work this time, right?\n\n213\n00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:57.790\nWe're hoping that it will start\ndoing what you've seen before.\n\n214\n00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:03.320\nSo what I've done is I've loaded the\noptical disk right into the optical drive,\n\n215\n00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:03.898\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:03.898 --> 00:11:07.403\nAnd we're going to tell the boot\nin the BIOS, the boot sequence,\n\n217\n00:11:07.403 --> 00:11:09.332\nlook to the optical drive, right?\n\n218\n00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:11.860\nWe want you to look to the optical drive.\n\n219\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.760\nAnd we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n220\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.820\nAnd when it brings up notice that\nit says Windows is loading files.\n\n221\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.315\nYou might be asking yourself,\nwait a second.\n\n222\n00:11:18.315 --> 00:11:23.786\nHow's Windows loading files if Windows\nisn't even on this machine, right?\n\n223\n00:11:23.786 --> 00:11:25.680\nI told you,\nthere's no operating system installed.\n\n224\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.100\nWell that's another component.\n\n225\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.050\nThat's something known as WinPE.\n\n226\n00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.320\nIt's been around for a while,\nWinPE is the pre-installation environment.\n\n227\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:40.890\nEssentially, it's a highly optimized\nsmall footprint operating system.\n\n228\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.600\nAll it allows you to do is pull\nthe Windows operating system\n\n229\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.670\nfiles off of this media and start\nwriting them to the hard drive, right?\n\n230\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.592\nNow I do apologize ahead of time.\n\n231\n00:11:50.592 --> 00:11:52.780\nYou'll see there's kinda\nsome black bars around this.\n\n232\n00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.335\nI don't have any video drivers, right?\n\n233\n00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:57.455\n&gt;&gt; Well, they kinda lends to\nwhat we're talking about, right?\n\n234\n00:11:57.455 --> 00:12:01.456\nWith the whole, I need to be able to do\nthings, like you said, post-installation,\n\n235\n00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:04.695\nto make sure this computer runs in\nthe way that I hope that it will run.\n\n236\n00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:06.992\nAnyway, fingers crossed\nthere a lot of times.\n\n237\n00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:10.340\nBut I have to install things liked drivers\nand updates and things like that, right?\n\n238\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.941\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\nI'm glad you mentioned that,\n\n239\n00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:13.731\nbecause that's something that\nwe have to look at, right?\n\n240\n00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:16.133\nAfter I load the operating system on it,\n\n241\n00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:19.324\nits got to be able to\nrecognize the hardware, right?\n\n242\n00:12:19.324 --> 00:12:25.344\nAt this point, WinPE at least has what's\nknown as a generic VGA driver, right?\n\n243\n00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:28.880\nYou pay attention to our hardware shows,\nand\n\n244\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.820\nyou'll know a little bit more\nabout the video graphics array.\n\n245\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.272\nBut what it's doing is it say, hey.\n\n246\n00:12:35.272 --> 00:12:38.810\nHere's a basic driver that allows\nyou pretty much the majority of\n\n247\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.880\nall graphics cards to at least function\nwithin this environment, right?\n\n248\n00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.720\n&gt;&gt; Give you some functionality.\n\n249\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.965\nWell, obviously it's gonna be\nhelpful as you try to install,\n\n250\n00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:48.380\nbecause it didn't work.\n\n251\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.746\nWell, you're not going\nanywhere real quick, right?\n\n252\n00:12:49.746 --> 00:12:53.033\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda hard to work with your\ncomputer if you can't see anything, right?\n\n253\n00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:54.854\nSo good thing to have, and like I said,\n\n254\n00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:57.575\nthat's why you see these kind\nof matted bars around here.\n\n255\n00:12:57.575 --> 00:12:59.258\nNow, my heads kinda covering up,\n\n256\n00:12:59.258 --> 00:13:02.520\nbut this is the Windows\npre-installation environment, right?\n\n257\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.490\nAnd you can set things.\n\n258\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.150\nI guess that would be\npre-installation completely, right?\n\n259\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.330\nOur language to install,\ntime currency and format, right?\n\n260\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.410\nThere are usually a few options here, but\n\n261\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.660\nobviously we're going\nto stick with English.\n\n262\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.120\nLanguage to install,\nis really interesting.\n\n263\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.730\nIt's really gonna be based on\nwhatever the language edition\n\n264\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.160\nof your operating system is.\n\n265\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.040\nYou really don't get to pick that.\n\n266\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.770\nYou can download in later,\nafter post-installation.\n\n267\n00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:36.014\nYou can download things like your language\npacks if you wanna add language to it.\n\n268\n00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:39.782\nBut that's gonna be contingent on\nwhatever the installation media is when\n\n269\n00:13:39.782 --> 00:13:41.710\nyou do the install for the first time.\n\n270\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.404\nAll right, we also got, and\n\n271\n00:13:43.404 --> 00:13:47.228\nagain here, kinda we've got\nthe keyboard import method here.\n\n272\n00:13:47.228 --> 00:13:49.699\nAnd you can kind of see we've\ngot some different options here.\n\n273\n00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:52.546\nAnd then just behind my head we've\ngot the Next button here and\n\n274\n00:13:52.546 --> 00:13:53.656\nI'm going to go ahead.\n\n275\n00:13:53.656 --> 00:13:57.790\nWe'll press the next button, and now you\ncan see that we're ready to install.\n\n276\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.270\nNow as this being the accelerated version,\n\n277\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:05.170\nwe're not going to go into too much\ndepth about what you need to know\n\n278\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.400\nabout the hardware when it\ncomes to pre- installation.\n\n279\n00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.200\nI want you to open up your search engine,\ngo to Microsoft, and\n\n280\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.030\nsee what the full set of requirements are\nto be able to run the operating system.\n\n281\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.331\nI could tell you very basically though,\nit's 1 GHz processor.\n\n282\n00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:25.999\nIf you're talking about the RAM,\nit's one gig of RAM for a 32-bit system,\n\n283\n00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:26.930\n2 gigabytes.\n\n284\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:33.040\n1 GB for a 32-bit system and\n2 GB for a 64-bit system.\n\n285\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:39.822\nAlso remember that they do recommend in\nVista at least 40 gigs free on the drive.\n\n286\n00:14:39.822 --> 00:14:45.006\nI believe it's a 40 gig\ndrive with 20 gigs free for\n\n287\n00:14:45.006 --> 00:14:48.586\nWindows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n288\n00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:53.549\nAs well as making sure that you have\na video card driver that supports\n\n289\n00:14:53.549 --> 00:14:55.500\nsomething known as WDDM.\n\n290\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.430\nAlright, so\n\n291\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.250\nthose are some of the basic environments\nthat you have to keep in mind.\n\n292\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.574\nHowever, you're doing your installation,\ncheck our practice labs out.\n\n293\n00:15:04.574 --> 00:15:07.075\nYou members out there that have\naccess to the practice labs can do\n\n294\n00:15:07.075 --> 00:15:08.010\nthese installations.\n\n295\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.020\nAnd you can use this What To Know\nbefore you install Windows.\n\n296\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.365\nAnd there's a truckload of information.\n\n297\n00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:17.129\nThey tell you a lot of information\nabout the upgrading to Windows 7,\n\n298\n00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:19.189\nwhich we've talked about\nalready in this series.\n\n299\n00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:22.946\nKnowing things like the upgrade paths,\nand even giving you the URLs that you can\n\n300\n00:15:22.946 --> 00:15:27.170\ngo and you can research this information\na little bit more, so great to know too.\n\n301\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.740\nI also will take a second and you'll see\nwhen we get into our troubleshooting\n\n302\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.890\nepisodes, we're gonna talk about something\nknown as the Windows Recovery Environment.\n\n303\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:39.030\nThe Windows Recovery Environment is the\nplace where you can actually do a repair\n\n304\n00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.180\non a machine that's having giving\nyou a little bit of problems.\n\n305\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.953\nAnd if we can check out that\nscreen here real quick,\n\n306\n00:15:43.953 --> 00:15:46.935\nyou'll see that there's\nthis Repair Your Computer.\n\n307\n00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:49.851\nThe WinPE, or\nthe pre-installation environment,\n\n308\n00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:54.011\nessentially is what gives you access\nto WinRE, the recovery environment.\n\n309\n00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:57.056\nAlright, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose Install Now.\n\n310\n00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.343\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nthe setup is going to start.\n\n311\n00:15:59.343 --> 00:16:00.176\n&gt;&gt; And you're done.\n\n312\n00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:01.553\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, that's right.\n\n313\n00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:05.452\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\ncase dismissed, class closed.\n\n314\n00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:07.100\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n315\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.360\nSo keep in mind that the first thing\nthat comes up is the end user license\n\n316\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.020\nagreement, right?\n\n317\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.480\nAnd as we'll talk about in our operational\nsections, operational procedures,\n\n318\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.650\nwe have some things that we have to talk\nabout, ULAs and user license policies.\n\n319\n00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Lawyers always gotta get involved.\n\n320\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.658\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\nat the end of this episode,\n\n321\n00:16:22.658 --> 00:16:27.230\nyou notice if we scroll down here right,\nall right, and we'll keep scrolling.\n\n322\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.731\nAll right, Dan.\n\n323\n00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:28.447\nDan's got that in the [CROSSTALK] episode.\n\n324\n00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:30.380\n&gt;&gt; Memorized, memorized.\n\n325\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.399\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna go ahead and\n\n326\n00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:36.868\nwe're gonna give him a quiz on clause 32,\nsection A slash B.\n\n327\n00:16:36.868 --> 00:16:39.077\n&gt;&gt; No, that's on the reproduction of,\nno, I don't know now.\n\n328\n00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:39.986\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n329\n00:16:39.986 --> 00:16:41.240\n[LAUGH] I was gonna say,\nyou're awesome man.\n\n330\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.502\nThat's great.\n\n331\n00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.770\nWhat are the lottery numbers, right?\n\n332\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go.\n\n333\n00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:49.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead what we'll do is we'll\n\n334\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.326\nsign our life away to Microsoft here, and\nI mean that and when I say that Dan will,\n\n335\n00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:55.777\nand then again my head's\nkind of covering this up,\n\n336\n00:16:55.777 --> 00:16:57.780\nwe got the next option right here, okay?\n\n337\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.929\nSo we'll just choose Next.\n\n338\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.060\nAnd now be careful on\nthe exam with this one.\n\n339\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.340\nThis one trips a lot of people up.\n\n340\n00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.350\nIf you've never seen this before, right?\n\n341\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.720\nIt gets tricky, all right?\n\n342\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.110\nWhere's the install button?\n\n343\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.420\nThere isn't one, right?\n\n344\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.074\nWhere is the clean install?\n\n345\n00:17:15.074 --> 00:17:19.310\nWe talked about a clean installation\nbeing a fresh installation of Windows.\n\n346\n00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.440\nWe talked about an upgrade.\n\n347\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.650\nWell, you can see the upgrade.\n\n348\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.660\nWhat you can't see is clean install.\n\n349\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.600\n&gt;&gt; I like how they put the upgrade first.\n\n350\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.154\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n351\n00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:31.414\n&gt;&gt; That's even more confusing in my mind\nbecause typically when I'm installing\n\n352\n00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:33.450\nWindows it is a clean install.\n\n353\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.950\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and what's interesting is\nif I was to push the upgrade right now it\n\n354\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.970\nwould tell me to not do that.\n\n355\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n356\n00:17:40.204 --> 00:17:41.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just pressed it.\n\n357\n00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.970\nThe computer started using\nthe Windows installation disc.\n\n358\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.503\nRemove the installation disc and restart\nyour computer so Windows starts normally,\n\n359\n00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:53.261\nso it's probably one of the most\nuseless buttons I've ever seen.\n\n360\n00:17:53.261 --> 00:17:55.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.909\n&gt;&gt; Sorry Microsoft, I mean.\n\n362\n00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n363\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.118\n&gt;&gt; Just saying, it is what it is.\n\n364\n00:17:59.118 --> 00:18:02.120\nSo we're gonna do\na custom installation and\n\n365\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.530\nhere's where we can do things like drive\noptions if we needed to do some formating.\n\n366\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:12.100\nIf you don't see a location inside\nyour operating system here or\n\n367\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.730\ninside of the Windows pre\ninstallation environment.\n\n368\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.750\nIf I come up and this is blank, it doesn't\ntell me that there's unallocated space\n\n369\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.750\nwhich means I have an unformatted drive.\n\n370\n00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.880\nChances are you've got really one thing\nthat I can think up off the top of\n\n371\n00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.850\nmy head, potentially a second thing.\n\n372\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.374\nIf you've got a normal configuration, what\nyou have is a chipset driver that Windows\n\n373\n00:18:31.374 --> 00:18:35.080\npre-installation environment\ndoesn't have built in to it.\n\n374\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.490\nSee, even PE,\nwhen PE is being a small operating system\n\n375\n00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.090\nhas pre-bundled drivers and\nthat's why you can see the video here.\n\n376\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.750\nIt's got that pre-bundled VGA driver, but\nit might not have the chipset driver,\n\n377\n00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.260\nthey're pretty good at getting all\nof the chipset drivers in there.\n\n378\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.731\nBut if it doesn't happen, you have to\ngo to your manufacturer, obviously with\n\n379\n00:18:55.731 --> 00:19:00.067\nanother computer, go to your\nmanufacturer's website of the motherboard.\n\n380\n00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:03.663\nLook wherever their help and support is,\ndownload the chipset driver to a thumb\n\n381\n00:19:03.663 --> 00:19:05.605\ndrive and\nyou could put it in this machine.\n\n382\n00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:09.699\nIf we take a look at this computer here I\ncould load the driver up by pressing that\n\n383\n00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:11.840\nbutton and then choosing Browse.\n\n384\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.400\nAnd it would allow me to find that\nlocation here in the list, right.\n\n385\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.550\nOr as you can see, I could potentially\nfind it within the optical drive\n\n386\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.360\nif I decide that I'm gonna put it on a CD.\n\n387\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.480\nMaybe it came with the installation CD or\n\n388\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.360\nDVD that came with the computer\nthat you're currently on the build.\n\n389\n00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.320\nUnderstand that if you eject\nthe installation CD at this point,\n\n390\n00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.790\nyou're just fine to get the driver,\nso eject the CD, right?\n\n391\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.955\nPut the CD from the manufacturer's\nmotherboard in there, find the driver,\n\n392\n00:19:45.955 --> 00:19:49.669\nload it up, then eject the CD and\nput the installation media back in,\n\n393\n00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:51.997\njust a quick tip and\npiece of advice there.\n\n394\n00:19:51.997 --> 00:19:57.171\nI'm gonna go and choose cancel to\nthat because it has found our drive,\n\n395\n00:19:57.171 --> 00:20:01.029\nI don't need to do any type\nof configurations here so\n\n396\n00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:04.906\nI don't have to do any post\nformatting of the drive.\n\n397\n00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:06.980\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njust select this one.\n\n398\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.000\nIn fact let me cancel that,\nmake sure that this is highlighted and\n\n399\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.620\nwe will choose next.\n\n400\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.880\nAnd you'll see that it's gonna go through\nthe process of expanding the files and\n\n401\n00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.460\nthen installing some of those\nfeatures that we were talking about.\n\n402\n00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.960\nAnd you can see,\nit's pretty much that easy.\n\n403\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.900\nThat's the installation of Windows, right?\n\n404\n00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.720\nYou're gonna go through\na few processes and\n\n405\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.401\nthis is gonna take a while here, right?\n\n406\n00:20:27.401 --> 00:20:29.330\nAnd you're gonna see\nbasically a progress bar.\n\n407\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.930\nRemember that when you're\ninstalling Windows,\n\n408\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.160\na lot of it is going to be just that.\n\n409\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.600\nIt's gonna be waiting on a progress bar,\nnothing more than that.\n\n410\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.649\nIn fact, quite a few of your IT, I guess,\n\n411\n00:20:39.649 --> 00:20:44.196\ncareer will be just that,\nwaiting on a progress bar, right?\n\n412\n00:20:44.196 --> 00:20:46.170\n&gt;&gt; Just your time wasting away.\n\n413\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.290\nHope you got a good game of Freecell\ngoing on because at this point,\n\n414\n00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.940\nthat's what you're doing, waiting, right?\n\n415\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n416\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.040\nNow it really isn't much different\nwhen you talk about installing your\n\n417\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.990\nWindows 8.1.\n\n418\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.380\nIn fact, Win PE, it's interface really\nhasn't changed that much, right?\n\n419\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.579\nSo the installation process is\ngonna be very, very similar,\n\n420\n00:21:05.579 --> 00:21:08.338\nall with the same clicks as well, okay.\n\n421\n00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:13.734\nNow one of the things that I will tell\nyou that might differ just a little\n\n422\n00:21:13.734 --> 00:21:19.061\nbit is if you, when you talk about\nthings like Windows 8.1 right?\n\n423\n00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:22.974\nWith Windows 8.1, well, Windows 8 and\n\n424\n00:21:22.974 --> 00:21:30.550\n8.1 you will see that they introduced\nthe Microsoft account, all right?\n\n425\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.770\nWhen they introduced the Microsoft\naccount into the operating system,\n\n426\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.800\nit now integrates.\n\n427\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.180\nNow Windows Microsoft account, understand,\n\n428\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.160\nlet me make sure that I'm\nclear on this statement.\n\n429\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.319\nThe Microsoft account has been around for\nawhile.\n\n430\n00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:46.880\nIt was called the Windows Live ID, but\nit was more of an online-based thing.\n\n431\n00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.427\nAll right, when Windows 8.1 came out, they\nsaid, you know what, we're gonna go ahead\n\n432\n00:21:52.427 --> 00:21:57.490\nand we're gonna allow you the ability if\nyou want to, to integrate that live idea.\n\n433\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.150\nOr that Microsoft account\nwith your operating system so\n\n434\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.612\nthat you can take advantage of\nthe cloud-based technologies, right.\n\n435\n00:22:03.612 --> 00:22:08.654\nWe talk about that in our mobile device\nsection here at the accelerated and\n\n436\n00:22:08.654 --> 00:22:14.773\neven if you want in more detail, we've got\nthe full A+ 902 exam, check it out there.\n\n437\n00:22:14.773 --> 00:22:18.178\nBut it allows you to synchronize\nyour settings, your pictures, and\n\n438\n00:22:18.178 --> 00:22:21.891\nstuff like that across multiple devices\nincluding your Windows desktop.\n\n439\n00:22:21.891 --> 00:22:25.005\nBut the installation past\nthat isn't much different.\n\n440\n00:22:25.005 --> 00:22:27.495\nLet me show you here so you guys can see.\n\n441\n00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:29.655\nSo here I've got a Windows 8 machine.\n\n442\n00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:32.037\nAnd the installation is\nalready complete right here.\n\n443\n00:22:32.037 --> 00:22:35.717\nAnd you see that one of the first things\npost installation that we need to do,\n\n444\n00:22:35.717 --> 00:22:37.747\nlet's give this PC a name.\n\n445\n00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:40.058\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n446\n00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:44.660\nI'm going to call this, what should I\ncall this, I'll call it Client 01 and\n\n447\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.589\nagain my head's kinda covering it\nup within these sections here.\n\n448\n00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:53.237\nWe'll choose next, and here's where we\ntalk about express settings, all right.\n\n449\n00:22:53.237 --> 00:22:56.337\nNow, express settings,\nwe could use customize right here.\n\n450\n00:22:56.337 --> 00:22:57.849\nAnd if I use customize,\n\n451\n00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:03.374\nit's gonna ask me each one of these bullet\npoints if you will, individually, right.\n\n452\n00:23:03.374 --> 00:23:09.629\nDo I wanna automatically find devices and\ncontent on this network, install updates,\n\n453\n00:23:09.629 --> 00:23:15.041\nright, so, that's up to you if you\nwanna customize each individual one.\n\n454\n00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:18.789\nOr you could use express settings and what\nexpress settings will do is just kinda do\n\n455\n00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:21.190\nit according to Microsoft's best practice.\n\n456\n00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.410\nI'm gonna go ahead and use best practices\nand just use the express setting.\n\n457\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.296\nNow here's what I said, here's one of\nthe differences between the Windows\n\n458\n00:23:30.296 --> 00:23:33.818\n7 setup and the Windows 8.1 or\n8 and 8.1 setup.\n\n459\n00:23:33.818 --> 00:23:36.750\nNotice it says sign into your\nMicrosoft account, right?\n\n460\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.710\nThis is where they want you to\nintegrate that Microsoft account.\n\n461\n00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.280\nAgain, used to be called the Windows\nLive ID with your operating system.\n\n462\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.460\nNow you'll also have some options\ndown here, Don't have an account?\n\n463\n00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.899\nCreate a new account.\n\n464\n00:23:47.899 --> 00:23:49.525\nBe careful on the exam on this one.\n\n465\n00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:50.803\nLet me tell you why.\n\n466\n00:23:50.803 --> 00:23:53.248\nCreate new account, all right?\n\n467\n00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:57.412\nWhat if they ask you,\nyou don't want to use a Microsoft account?\n\n468\n00:23:57.412 --> 00:23:58.650\nDo you have the option?\n\n469\n00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.989\nYou want to use a local account, right?\n\n470\n00:23:59.989 --> 00:24:03.520\nMy company, I'm installing this for\nmy company, and\n\n471\n00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.960\nmy company uses their own\nair gap private network.\n\n472\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.190\nWe're not doing anything online,\nwhere's your option?\n\n473\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.720\nThat's why I say, exam alert.\n\n474\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.750\nNotice that creating a new account,\nwhat does it do?\n\n475\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.830\nWatch this, it wants you to\ncreate a Microsoft account.\n\n476\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.900\nWell, you don't wanna do that, right?\n\n477\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.360\nAnd we could that here, but again,\n\n478\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.340\nbig tip here, this little jump\nlink down here, tricky, tricky.\n\n479\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.240\nAll right, so pay attention on the exam.\n\n480\n00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.540\nCuz now, when I do this this is your\ntraditional, what we'll see in Windows 7.\n\n481\n00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.220\nThe way to do a local account,\nand we'll just go ahead and\n\n482\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.050\nwe'll call this admin\nbecause I'm very creative.\n\n483\n00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.550\nWe'll give it a super secret\nMicrosoft password there.\n\n484\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.945\nAnd you will never guess\nwhat that password is.\n\n485\n00:24:49.945 --> 00:24:53.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And again, right behind my head here,\n\n486\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.710\nwe will choose the Finish button and\nit's gonna finalize the settings.\n\n487\n00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.410\nNow, when it finalizes the settings,\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n488\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.270\nYou have what's known as a default\nprofile that is like a template for\n\n489\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.329\nevery Windows user that's gonna sign\ninto this machine for the first time.\n\n490\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.900\nWell, this is the first user,\nsigning in for the first time.\n\n491\n00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:16.620\nSo what it's doing is it's going through\nthe process of creating that profile.\n\n492\n00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.970\nCreating the Documents folder,\nthe Contacts folder if you will.\n\n493\n00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.520\nThe Video, Music folder if you will.\n\n494\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.910\nAll of that information,\n\n495\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:31.270\nthat specific location where every\nuser stores their own specific data.\n\n496\n00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.490\nLet's see where we are in\nour Windows setup.\n\n497\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.650\nOkay, good.\n\n498\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.920\nHere's our Windows 7 setup I should say.\n\n499\n00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.720\nSo I did finish right there in time,\nit looks like it's good timing here.\n\n500\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.940\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n501\n00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.625\nNotice it is a little bit different,\nbut it's not too much different.\n\n502\n00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:47.005\nIf you've seen this interface\nbefore you go into the exam booth,\n\n503\n00:25:47.005 --> 00:25:48.275\nwhich is why we're doing this.\n\n504\n00:25:48.275 --> 00:25:54.645\nSo if I wanna type the user name, you can\nonly think that it's going to be admin.\n\n505\n00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:57.930\nNotice I do not want it\nto be admin PC here.\n\n506\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.100\nSo I name that client01.\n\n507\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.050\nWe'll just call this client02 because who\nknows, they might be on the same network.\n\n508\n00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.330\nAnd we need some kinda uniqueness or\nthat'll cause problems.\n\n509\n00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.690\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\ntype the super secret,\n\n510\n00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.800\nI think I did, I think I did\nthat wrong on the second one.\n\n511\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.600\nI'm gonna type the super\nsecret Microsoft password, and\n\n512\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.320\nyou will never guess what it is.\n\n513\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.130\n&gt;&gt; You sounded like the little\nengine that could there.\n\n514\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.150\nI think I typed it,\nI think I typed it [LAUGH].\n\n515\n00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.760\n&gt;&gt; I think I can, I think I can,\nthat's right [LAUGH].\n\n516\n00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.090\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Next here.\n\n517\n00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.130\nNow, here is something I\nalso wanted to show you.\n\n518\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.920\nNotice that Windows 8.1 didn't prompt\nme for a product key, all right?\n\n519\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.040\nWhen should you put in a product key?\n\n520\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.440\nWell, your first guess\nmight be right away, right?\n\n521\n00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.500\nI just paid for this operating system,\nI wanna activate it.\n\n522\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.100\nIf I activate Windows,\nI get the full functionality.\n\n523\n00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.490\nAnd you'd be absolutely wrong.\n\n524\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.600\nLet me tell you why.\n\n525\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.520\nIf you install this operating system and\n\n526\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.360\nyou activate it now,\nit will create a hardware profile\n\n527\n00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.110\nthat's gonna be associated with\nthis installation of Windows.\n\n528\n00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.090\nWhat happens if Windows doesn't\nperform the way you want?\n\n529\n00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.960\nThen you have to make some\nchanges to the machine.\n\n530\n00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.670\nYou say, I gotta upgrade\nthe processor because it's not giving\n\n531\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.650\nthe performance I want.\n\n532\n00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.500\nI wanna add a few more,\na little bit of RAM.\n\n533\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.160\nI hate this hard drive.\n\n534\n00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.450\nI'm gonna put a 10,000 RPM Velociraptor.\n\n535\n00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.980\nOr maybe I don't even wanna\ngo with mechanical drives,\n\n536\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.470\nI'm gonna put in a solid state.\n\n537\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.390\nThere's gonna be a certain point where you\nstart adding new stuff to that hardware\n\n538\n00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.500\nwhere it's gonna look like a new machine\nto the operating system when it boots.\n\n539\n00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.620\nAnd when it does,\nit's gonna remove your activation.\n\n540\n00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.260\nHere's what I recommend, all right?\n\n541\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.320\nUncheck Automatically activate\nwhen I'm online and choose Skip.\n\n542\n00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.550\nYes, I said that and\nMicrosoft even recommends that.\n\n543\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.450\nI'm not telling you to do something,\nI'm not advocating privacy.\n\n544\n00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.837\n&gt;&gt; Begs the question, Wes,\n\n545\n00:27:41.837 --> 00:27:45.319\nwhy do they have this option if\nthey're telling you don't do it?\n\n546\n00:27:45.319 --> 00:27:48.663\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nif you end up buying a machine that your,\n\n547\n00:27:48.663 --> 00:27:52.579\nmaybe had Windows Vista and\nyou're doing a clean installation,\n\n548\n00:27:52.579 --> 00:27:57.660\nit's got plenty of power on it, you might\nas well just go ahead and activate it.\n\n549\n00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.900\nI will tell you,\nit's not a best practice, though.\n\n550\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.110\n&gt;&gt; So Bill Gates' nephew works for\nhim cuz his son needs a job.\n\n551\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.980\n&gt;&gt; He needed a job.\n\n552\n00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.390\n&gt;&gt; He's like,\nI'll make this cool activation feature.\n\n553\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.860\nAnd it's no one uses it.\n\n554\n00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.371\n&gt;&gt; Well, he was two steps from\ngetting the red stapler and\n\n555\n00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:13.076\nthe office in the basement, right?\n\n556\n00:28:13.076 --> 00:28:14.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a can of gas [LAUGH].\n\n557\n00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.134\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n558\n00:28:15.134 --> 00:28:17.390\nSo I say skip it.\n\n559\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.820\nUse the 30 day grace\nperiod that you have so\n\n560\n00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.570\nthat you can make sure Windows\nfunctions the way you want.\n\n561\n00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.870\nYou might find out within a couple\nof days, hey, everything is great.\n\n562\n00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.550\nI love it, activate it then.\n\n563\n00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.190\n&gt;&gt; So after activation,\nit locks that hardware profile down?\n\n564\n00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.060\n&gt;&gt; It does, it does, yeah.\n\n565\n00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:36.550\nWhat happens when you do an activation\nis essentially with every\n\n566\n00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.960\ninstallation that you buy, every operating\nsystem that you buy from Microsoft,\n\n567\n00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.260\nthey have a product ID that's in\na database that they own, right?\n\n568\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.310\nThat they keep track of, right?\n\n569\n00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:49.010\nWhat they don't have is\na blank hardware identifier,\n\n570\n00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.180\nblank field probably in a spreadsheet,\nright?\n\n571\n00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.010\nIn that database, if you will,\n\n572\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:59.130\nthat is waiting to be associated\nwith that product identifier.\n\n573\n00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.300\nWhen you do an activation, what you're\ndoing when it says activate online is\n\n574\n00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.510\nyou're taking the product ID that is\nassociated with this installation media,\n\n575\n00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:12.280\nand the hardware ID that's generated in\nthe registry, you're marrying the two and\n\n576\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.270\nyou're sending it to Microsoft.\n\n577\n00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:19.050\nMicrosoft says, I see that product\nidentifier, this is a legal, licensed copy\n\n578\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.740\nof Windows, it's ours, you paid for\nit legally, let me look at our database.\n\n579\n00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.260\nHas this ever been activated before?\n\n580\n00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.610\nI don't see a hardware identifier.\n\n581\n00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.880\nIt's a fresh installation.\n\n582\n00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.030\nLet's marry the two.\n\n583\n00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.550\nAnd it creates a third identifier\ncalled an activation ID.\n\n584\n00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.430\nThat gets sent back to your\ncomputer over the network and\n\n585\n00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.110\ngets stored in the registry.\n\n586\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.230\nAnd every time your computer boots, part\nof the boot process is looking at that\n\n587\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.800\nhardware identifier and associating\nit with the activation identifier.\n\n588\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.753\nNow, boot your computer and\na hardware blueprint is created,\n\n589\n00:29:52.753 --> 00:29:56.024\nkind of like a checksum, if you will, and\n\n590\n00:29:56.024 --> 00:30:01.830\nthose hardware identifiers don't match,\nit removes your activation.\n\n591\n00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.395\nIt doesn't even look at that\nactivation identifier anymore, and\n\n592\n00:30:04.395 --> 00:30:05.550\nit says something's wrong.\n\n593\n00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:10.760\nAnd what this does is it prevents people\nfrom activating a operating system and\n\n594\n00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.980\ntaking the hard drive out and\nputting it in different machines and\n\n595\n00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.520\nnever having to pay for\na Windows operating system again.\n\n596\n00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.930\n&gt;&gt; So riddle me this, Batman.\n\n597\n00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.929\nYou're punching away, you've activated\nyour machine, everything's going fine, and\n\n598\n00:30:21.929 --> 00:30:24.360\nyour motherboard dies and\nyou have to buy another one.\n\n599\n00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.360\nYou also have to buy\nanother copy of Windows?\n\n600\n00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.700\n&gt;&gt; No.\nThey're really, really good about that.\n\n601\n00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.990\nSometimes it doesn't happen.\n\n602\n00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.570\nI wish I could tell you where it happens,\nwhen it doesn't.\n\n603\n00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.460\nBut if I did, I could basically have all\nthe free copies of Windows I ever wanted.\n\n604\n00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.550\nWorse case scenario, what you do is\nthey give you a little identifier,\n\n605\n00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.960\nyou'll have to make a phone call.\n\n606\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.760\nI've had to do this before\nin warranty calls, and\n\n607\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.940\nyou get online with them and\nyou tell them what goes on.\n\n608\n00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.390\nAnd a lot of times what they'll do is\nthey'll give you this crazy long 48\n\n609\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.430\ndigit identifier.\n\n610\n00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.240\n&gt;&gt; I've done this.\n\n611\n00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n612\n00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.550\nIt does happen, and\nthey're usually really good.\n\n613\n00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.751\nIf you say, hey, this is what I did,\n\n614\n00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:02.666\nyou can kind of prove that It's\na Western digital drive, right?\n\n615\n00:31:02.666 --> 00:31:06.040\nAnd they've got ways that they can check\nit and they'll activate it for you.\n\n616\n00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.280\nBut they won't let you do the convenient\npush a button activation, right?\n\n617\n00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.590\nThat they do the first time.\n\n618\n00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.550\nSo those are some of the things\nthat we have to take care of.\n\n619\n00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:18.350\nThe one last thing that I want to\ntalk about real, just very quickly.\n\n620\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.530\nLet's go ahead and\nfinish this up real quick.\n\n621\n00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:22.870\nLet me dive back in.\n\n622\n00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.600\nI know we're out of time here.\n\n623\n00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.130\nI want to go ahead and\njust wrap this one up real quick.\n\n624\n00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.550\nUse recommended settings.\n\n625\n00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.680\nChange it from specific time, or\nPacific time, Bill Gates time here.\n\n626\n00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.600\nOr whatever your local time might be.\n\n627\n00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.420\nI'm gonna use Eastern time.\n\n628\n00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.800\nWe'll choose next and then what network\nyou believe you're connected to.\n\n629\n00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.130\nI'm gonna say the home network cuz I trust\nthe computers that are on this network.\n\n630\n00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:52.030\nIt's gonna apply that to the profile, it's\ngonna apply it to that network profile,\n\n631\n00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.160\nthe firewall's gonna make\nsome configurations, and\n\n632\n00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.480\nit's gonna ask if we wanna\nset up a home group.\n\n633\n00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.740\nI'm gonna say no.\n\n634\n00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.180\nAnd it's gonna finalize our settings,\nand it's doing the same thing that our\n\n635\n00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.950\nWindows 8.1 machine was doing as\nit's building that user profile.\n\n636\n00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.750\nLast thing that I wanna mention.\n\n637\n00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.910\nYou should go to do right away,\n\n638\n00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.420\nis you should right-click if you're in\nthe Windows 8 operating system, right?\n\n639\n00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.070\nGo to the desktop, right-click on your\nWindows charm, and you should, and\n\n640\n00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.630\nwhere is it?\n\n641\n00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.310\nRight here is Device Manager.\n\n642\n00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.260\nYou should go to Device Manager because\nyou might see things like this where it\n\n643\n00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.786\ndoesn't recognize something.\n\n644\n00:32:25.786 --> 00:32:26.710\nDan, you mentioned this.\n\n645\n00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.820\nRightly so.\n\n646\n00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.550\nAnd what I need to do is make sure\nthat I connect to Windows Update.\n\n647\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.800\nI update the drivers within\nthe operating system.\n\n648\n00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.650\nWe can see that inside\nof our control panel.\n\n649\n00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.700\nIf it comes up, there we go.\n\n650\n00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.700\nControl Panel, System and Security.\n\n651\n00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.310\nAnd you'll see Windows Update.\n\n652\n00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.510\nKeep in mind Control Panel,\n\n653\n00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.300\nlike we'll talk about in another episode,\nisn't much different.\n\n654\n00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.770\nOnly difference is I've got\na desktop here and no modern UI.\n\n655\n00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.910\nWe go to Start.\n\n656\n00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.570\nWe go to Control Panel,\nSystem and Security.\n\n657\n00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.780\nWe go to Windows Update.\n\n658\n00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.270\nBy default, it hasn't checked yet, and\nwhat we can do is chose check for updates.\n\n659\n00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.840\nAnd now it's gonna reach out and\n\n660\n00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.620\nit's gonna try to pull down\nany drivers it's not aware of.\n\n661\n00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.720\nYou could do this multiple times and have\nto restart your computer multiple times.\n\n662\n00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.770\nAlso make sure that if it doesn't find\ndrivers in the Windows Update doesn't mean\n\n663\n00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:19.980\nthat the drivers don't exist.\n\n664\n00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.740\nYou might just have to do your\nresearch on the hardware and\n\n665\n00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.390\ngo to whatever the manufacturer's\nwebsite is and download them manually.\n\n666\n00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.740\nAnd a lot of times what they have is\nexecutables, these applications that know\n\n667\n00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.670\nwhere the component should,\nwhere the driver should be installed.\n\n668\n00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:35.820\nYou click a couple buttons,\n\n669\n00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.230\ngo through a Wizard,\nit'll install them in the right locations.\n\n670\n00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.210\nDell is really good at that,\nHP I know is good at that too.\n\n671\n00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.440\nAnd it'll finish the installation.\n\n672\n00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.450\nNow, on another episode, we'll talk about\nsome of the other things that you need to\n\n673\n00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.300\ndo potentially post-installation,\nand that's network configuration.\n\n674\n00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.930\nBut I think we're gonna save that one for\nour network episode.\n\n675\n00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, great stuff.\n\n676\n00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.720\nWe do thank you for joining us today.\n\n677\n00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.430\nAnd looks like we had\na good time had by all.\n\n678\n00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.520\nI know I sure did.\n\n679\n00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.780\nHopefully you did as well, and\n\n680\n00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.890\nthat you learned something that you\nneed to pass that A+ exam with.\n\n681\n00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.450\nWes, we are well out of time for\nthis episode, so guess what?\n\n682\n00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.380\nWe're gonna call it a day.\n\n683\n00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.800\nThanks for watching, everybody.\n\n684\n00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.430\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n685\n00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.120\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n686\n00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.379\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n687\n00:34:16.683 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:12.013\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:16.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, welcome\nback to another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.795\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.780\nwe're back with more in\nour A+ Accelerated series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.660\nBeen a very interesting drive so far.\n\n8\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.200\nJoining us back in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.590\nagain, lending his expertise to us,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.610\nWes, good to have you here again,\nsir, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.186\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here, Dan.\n\n12\n00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:38.639\nThat's right, we are going to be looking\nat some of the utilities that might make\n\n13\n00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.472\nyour skin crawl if you have been so\n\n14\n00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:44.154\nreliant on the Windows graphical\nuser interface in this episode.\n\n15\n00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:48.276\nWe're gonna be talking about Microsoft\nCommand Prompt as well as some of the run\n\n16\n00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:52.231\nline commands that I would say a while\nago people really, really relied on.\n\n17\n00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.737\nAnd if you're first diving into this\ntype of administrative functionality,\n\n18\n00:00:56.737 --> 00:01:00.840\nhelp desk functionality,\nmaybe you haven't heard of them before.\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.760\nThat's what we're gonna be talking about\nin this episode, so let's go ahead and\n\n20\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.702\nlet's dive right in.\n\n21\n00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:10.510\nIn fact, rather than doing a lot of\ntalking here, let's just go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.510\ndo show and tell here.\n\n23\n00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.192\nSo, I'm on a Windows 8.1 machine here, and\nif we need to launch our command prompt,\n\n24\n00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:19.190\nthere's a couple of different\nways that we can do this.\n\n25\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.006\nIf you're in Windows 8.1,\nyou have the Modern/Metro UI,\n\n26\n00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.410\nyou could type three letters, cmd.\n\n27\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.515\nUnderstand that that is a run\nline command, believe it or not.\n\n28\n00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:34.160\nCmd.exe can actually launch\nthe Command Prompt, but\n\n29\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.100\nthey kinda couple that with\nthe search functionality, so\n\n30\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.800\nit's also intuitive enough to know that,\nhey, you're searching for Command Prompt.\n\n31\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.680\nNow, if I right-click on\nthe Command Prompt icon,\n\n32\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.320\nyou'll see that we got\na couple of options.\n\n33\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.250\nWe can pin this to the Taskbar,\nwhich is exactly what it sounds like,\n\n34\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250\nit'll be on the desktop.\n\n35\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.530\nWe can pin it to the Start menu,\nand if I pin it to the Start menu,\n\n36\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.410\nthat means it's gonna be out here\nsomewhere, should be if I scroll over.\n\n37\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.790\nThere it is, on our Start menu.\n\n38\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.092\nNow, again, I can also right-click\nfrom the Start menu the same way, and\n\n39\n00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.130\nnotice we have a couple of options.\n\n40\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.880\nNow I want to talk about\nthat option right there,\n\n41\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.190\nthat Run as administrator, so\nwhat does that mean for us?\n\n42\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.140\nKeep in mind that Command Prompt\nis essentially working with\n\n43\n00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.550\nWindows without the graphical\nuser interface, right?\n\n44\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.400\nIf you come from a Linux environment,\nif you come from a UNIX environment,\n\n45\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.750\nthis is already your bread and\nbutter, and this is yesterday's news.\n\n46\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.520\nBecause, for the longest time, and still\ntoday, a lot of the users that use those\n\n47\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.390\noperating systems rely on a text-based\ninput, text-based output, right?\n\n48\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.410\nBut I do want you to understand that if\nyou are coming from just a normal Windows\n\n49\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.260\nenvironment, this might be\na little intimidating to to you.\n\n50\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.470\nSo what is running as an administrator?\n\n51\n00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.280\nRunning an administrator means that not\nonly are you working with Windows without\n\n52\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.270\nthe graphical user interface, but\nyou can make functionality changes.\n\n53\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.210\nYou can make core changes, configuration\nchanges to the operating system\n\n54\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.220\nas well as things like security settings.\n\n55\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.130\nNow, if you're not familiar,\n\n56\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.570\nthis is also like running in a root user\ninside of your other operating systems,\n\n57\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.880\nyour nix based systems, again UNIX,\nMac, if you will, and Linux.\n\n58\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.662\nSo understand that.\n\n59\n00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:14.578\nThat that's the difference between running\nas an administrator as well as running as\n\n60\n00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:19.222\nwhat's known as, well, not necessarily\na standard or a non-administrator,\n\n61\n00:03:19.222 --> 00:03:22.727\nI guess you could say, but\nthey also call it a standard user.\n\n62\n00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:26.070\nRemember standard users are your\nnon-administrative users.\n\n63\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.290\nAll right, so let's go ahead and let's\ndive into the command prompt as well.\n\n64\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.960\nI'm gonna right-click on our desktop here.\n\n65\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.370\nAnd I can also get to the same\ntype of functionality by\n\n66\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.870\nlaunching either a basic command prompt.\n\n67\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.310\nAgain, doesn't say non-administrator or\nstandard user.\n\n68\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.111\nBut that's essentially what that is,\nor administrator.\n\n69\n00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.696\nSome of the things that\nI'm gonna show you and\n\n70\n00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:49.542\nsome of the commands that they call out\nrequire administrative-level access.\n\n71\n00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:52.728\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna save ourselves some trouble of\n\n72\n00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:54.732\nhaving to open two\ndifferent command prompts.\n\n73\n00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:57.455\nBecause, yes,\nyou will if you're standard user and\n\n74\n00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:01.572\nyou fire off a command that requires\nadministrative-level privileges like one\n\n75\n00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:05.770\nof them that we're gonna talk about,\nTask kill, you might get an access denied.\n\n76\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.640\nIf you get the access denied,\nunderstand that what it's letting\n\n77\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.660\nyou know is you're running this from\nthe context of a standard user.\n\n78\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.540\nAnd what you need to do is you need\nto close down that command prompt.\n\n79\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.710\nYou need to come back in here to where, if\nyou happen to have it on the start menu.\n\n80\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.310\nIf you happen to have it on the, well,\n\n81\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.640\nyou will have it on\nthe desktop by right-clicking.\n\n82\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.790\nAnd you need to launch\nit as administrator.\n\n83\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.465\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll save some time.\n\n84\n00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Man, I really wish that they had\nincorporated not only the fact that you\n\n85\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.760\nhave administrative command line\nas well as standard user, but\n\n86\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.700\nlike the pseudo command where you didn't\nneed to, well, I opened the wrong command,\n\n87\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.040\nlet me close that down and open another\none up using that Run as an administrator.\n\n88\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan, that would make it a lot\neasier, especially when you get sometimes\n\n89\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.090\nwhere you'll get some commands that you\nhave to run that are literally two or\n\n90\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.870\nthree lines in the command prompt cuz\na lot of text that you have to enter, and\n\n91\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.650\nyou click Enter.\n\n92\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.948\nAnd it says access denied,\nand you're like, okay,\n\n93\n00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.615\nI'll open [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; My way of getting around it\n\n94\n00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:06.800\nis I never open a standard\nuser command prompt.\n\n95\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800\nI just don't do it.\n\n96\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Hence why I started there, exactly.\n\n97\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.040\nBecause I've learned my lesson.\n\n98\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.210\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive in.\n\n99\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.440\nAnd I want you to remember that\nany command that you enter, for\n\n100\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.230\ninstance we're gonna do a tasklist.\n\n101\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.998\nAnd you can just add a space after that,\nremember it does need a space and\n\n102\n00:05:24.998 --> 00:05:27.156\na forward slash question mark.\n\n103\n00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:30.918\nAnd it'll give you what your,\nsome examples of all the switches and\n\n104\n00:05:30.918 --> 00:05:32.642\nthe parameters that you have.\n\n105\n00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:36.860\nHowever, keep in mind that\nit does require the space.\n\n106\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.880\nThe space is the delimiter,\nit's a delimiter between,\n\n107\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.270\nessentially it delimits the command\nfrom whatever its parameter is.\n\n108\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.110\nAnd then sometimes you have\noptions within a parameter, so\n\n109\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.840\nyou have to make sure that you're syntax,\nsyntax, syntax.\n\n110\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.710\nCuz in the Command Prompt,\nall you have is text, right?\n\n111\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.440\nSo it does matter.\n\n112\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.300\nAll right, so let's go ahead, and\nthis isn't really on the exam, but\n\n113\n00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.480\nyou should really know this one.\n\n114\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.290\nCls, that's just clear screen.\n\n115\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.700\nWe'll go ahead and we'll enter that and\n\n116\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.360\nthat kinda gives us a little bit more\nreal estate for what we're doing.\n\n117\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.130\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna pull this application up,\n\n118\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.710\nand I'm gonna run an application here.\n\n119\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.710\nThis is gonna kinda help me out here.\n\n120\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.530\nDon't worry about the application itself,\nbut\n\n121\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.150\nI wanted to show you why\nyou might use this command.\n\n122\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.190\nNot just say, hey,\nknow it for the exam and\n\n123\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.580\nreally not know maybe a scenario\nthat you might use it.\n\n124\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.500\nLet's say I've got a program.\n\n125\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.160\nI think it's running.\n\n126\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.210\nBut I'm really not sure, right?\n\n127\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.420\nIn fact, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n128\n00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.480\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nclose this down.\n\n129\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.832\nAnd if you can see,\nmy head's kind of covering this up.\n\n130\n00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:39.620\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n131\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.400\nI know that, I believe that this\nis running in the background.\n\n132\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.530\nLet me go ahead and choose Exit.\n\n133\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.560\nBut sometimes you'll have a command or\na program, well, did it run?\n\n134\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.520\nI just clicked it.\n\n135\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.300\nIt gave me this little spinning Cheerio.\n\n136\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.040\nBut what does that mean?\n\n137\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.890\nNow sometimes it could be as obvious\nas being in the notification area, and\n\n138\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.780\nI know that it's running.\n\n139\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.950\nBut what if it doesn't have a little icon?\n\n140\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.960\nWell, that's where something like\ntasklist comes in handy, right?\n\n141\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.760\nSo I can run something like tasklist,\nright?\n\n142\n00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.890\nAnd we can essentially,\nwhen we run it, we can find out what\n\n143\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.795\nare the processes that are running\nin the background, all right?\n\n144\n00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:19.305\nAnd you can see a lot of them.\n\n145\n00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:22.425\nNow I happen to know the name of this one,\nso I know that it's ZoomIt,\n\n146\n00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:24.020\nand I can see it in the list there, right?\n\n147\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.575\nZoomIt.exe, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:29.975\nWell, sometimes you have processes\nthat are running as well,\n\n149\n00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:31.435\nnot just straight up applications.\n\n150\n00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:34.840\nNotice that this is showing\nme applications, right?\n\n151\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.820\nWell, notice that there's also\nservices that are running here, too.\n\n152\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.260\nSo maybe I wanna know what\nservices are running.\n\n153\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:47.000\nWell, that's the great thing about\ntasklist, you can type tasklist /svc, and\n\n154\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.170\nwhen you run that now we're looking at\nexecutables, but notice this svchost.\n\n155\n00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.664\nWe're looking at services\nthat are running, right?\n\n156\n00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:59.074\nAnd I can also see what's known as, this\nsecond column sometimes helps me out, too,\n\n157\n00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:02.031\nthat's called a PID,\nthat's the process identifier.\n\n158\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.591\nAnd why would we even\nneed something like that?\n\n159\n00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:09.060\nWell, notice how many\nSVC hosts are running?\n\n160\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.550\nI can't really tell which one-\n&gt;&gt; Which SVC host do\n\n161\n00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.578\nyou want to work with?\n\n162\n00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:13.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Now Dan says that,\n\n164\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.600\ncuz I know he's done help desk before, and\n\n165\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.545\nyou gotta figure out\n&gt;&gt; There's like five of them running.\n\n166\n00:08:19.545 --> 00:08:20.780\n&gt;&gt; I just kill them all.\n&gt;&gt; What applications are-\n\n167\n00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.773\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What applications\n\n169\n00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:27.160\nare associated with them, and that's one\nthing about this that's really good.\n\n170\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.082\nWe can kinda see what the programs are in\nthe background that are kinda running\n\n171\n00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:32.620\nthese.\n\n172\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.769\nI can see that this SVC host\nis actually EventLog, right,\n\n173\n00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:39.400\ninside of our Event Viewer, right?\n\n174\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.920\nSo I can see kind of what Application or\n\n175\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.320\nwhat programs associated with\nthe services that are running.\n\n176\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.816\nNow, are all these running?\n\n177\n00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:52.020\nWell N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A,\nI'm not really sure.\n\n178\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.120\nWell that's where you could get\na little more granular, right?\n\n179\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.780\nIf I want to I can add a filter\nto this which is nice.\n\n180\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.270\nI could do a task, a list,\nspace forward slash fi for\n\n181\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.119\nfilter and I could give it what's known as\nan operator and I could do something like,\n\n182\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:12.230\nI don't believe it's k sensitive, but\nI can do status space eq for equals,\n\n183\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.730\nand I can give it that status of running,\nand I can run it.\n\n184\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.350\nEssentially, what this does is it allows\nme the ability to see what is running.\n\n185\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.940\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's clear the screen up.\n\n186\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.690\nAnd so task list is really,\n\n187\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.330\nreally good to identify the services that\nare essentially running in the background.\n\n188\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:36.280\nSo you see Dan, it's really, really handy,\nto be able to see what those tasks are,\n\n189\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.760\nservices and processes,\nthat are running in the background.\n\n190\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.832\nLet me go ahead and\nbring that one back up.\n\n191\n00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:43.780\nAnd I'm navigating by our arrows,\nup and down arrows,\n\n192\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.790\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n193\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.680\nIt's just like any other shell or\nterminal type interface, Command Prompt\n\n194\n00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.600\nalso does a history there, and I can\nrerun the last few commands if I want to.\n\n195\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.460\nI'm gonna rerun that one.\n\n196\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.520\nAnd I'm looking for\nthe one, and I'm looking for\n\n197\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.470\nthe one that is associated with ZoomIt,\nright?\n\n198\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.950\nRemember they're running here,\nso what I could see, and\n\n199\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.390\nit kinda clears up that list for me.\n\n200\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.453\nAnd notice that I have ZoomIt.exe.\n\n201\n00:10:05.453 --> 00:10:06.442\nWell this is great,\n\n202\n00:10:06.442 --> 00:10:10.190\nbecause this is kind of segues us\ninto what's known as task kill.\n\n203\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.380\nMaybe I find an application\nthat I don't want running.\n\n204\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.648\nNow I've had to do this before\nwith things like viruses, and\n\n205\n00:10:17.648 --> 00:10:22.500\nit was a process that I didn't know what\nit was, and I couldn't even identify it.\n\n206\n00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.480\nOr I identified it as you need to do\na little research on another computer.\n\n207\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like,\n\n208\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.420\nthat shouldn't be running, or\nit's running from the wrong location.\n\n209\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.220\nIt's a legitimate process if it's\nrunning from this location and\n\n210\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.090\nyou need to shut it down.\n\n211\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.550\nWell that's where Taskkill comes in,\nand Taskkill again,\n\n212\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.830\nif you're not sure exactly how to use it,\n\n213\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.460\nremember your space forward slash,\nspace forward slash question mark, right?\n\n214\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:52.240\nSo I know that I can use Taskkill\nwith a switch known as PID for\n\n215\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.190\nprocess identifier.\n\n216\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.140\nThat's why I said these\nPIDs kinda come in handy.\n\n217\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.380\nAnd I could find, in this case,\noops, there it goes.\n\n218\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.190\nI can find ZoomIt in the list, and\nhere's ZoomIt, I can see that hey,\n\n219\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.135\nthat's process 1664, so\nI can just go ahead and\n\n220\n00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:14.077\nsay Taskkill /pid, and\n\n221\n00:11:14.077 --> 00:11:17.830\nthen I can do 1664 and I can hit Enter.\n\n222\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:24.710\nNow, notice what it says, sent terminal\nsignal to the process with pid 1664.\n\n223\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.690\nWell, that lets me know that,\nhey, that is killed, right?\n\n224\n00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.450\nI shut that process down.\n\n225\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.230\nNow my question would be,\nis it really shut down?\n\n226\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.880\nWell, I don't know.\n\n227\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.139\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, I guess all we'd have to\ndo is rerun the task list command.\n\n228\n00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:39.130\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n229\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.521\nAnd If you're in a command prompt,\nmaybe in sometimes in a recovery,\n\n230\n00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:43.440\nyou type environment,\nmaybe that's all you've got.\n\n231\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.280\nAt least it'll allow you that\nability to go and check that out.\n\n232\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.230\nSo let's go ahead, and\nwe'll do exactly that.\n\n233\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.180\nWe'll clear the screen off here, and\n\n234\n00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.720\nwe'll go ahead and,\nlet's try that one more time, sorry.\n\n235\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.170\nI should have said that before\nI dived into the screen.\n\n236\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.230\nAnd let me tell you this, Tanesha,\n\n237\n00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.700\nI did it completely wrong either\nway let me tell you this.\n\n238\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.150\nI'll say yeah, Dan, that's great.\n\n239\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.697\nSo let's go ahead and do that,\nlet's clear the screen,\n\n240\n00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:12.555\nand then you can show the computer.\n\n241\n00:12:12.555 --> 00:12:14.242\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I should have said something before,\n\n242\n00:12:14.242 --> 00:12:15.630\nand I didn't even do it right, anyways.\n\n243\n00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.490\nI didnt even say it until we were\nalready on the computer, and Dan's gone.\n\n244\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.060\nAnd Dan's back, and he's gone.\n\n245\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.162\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, that's all we have to do.\n\n246\n00:12:24.162 --> 00:12:26.174\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We cleared the screen.\n\n247\n00:12:26.174 --> 00:12:27.046\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say wait.\n\n248\n00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:30.555\n&gt;&gt; Off the camera or not.\n\n250\n00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Threw her for a loop.\n\n251\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.830\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; Very mean.\n\n252\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.011\n&gt;&gt; The fun games that we\nplay here at ITProTV.\n\n253\n00:12:37.011 --> 00:12:37.511\n&gt;&gt; Whenever you're ready.\n\n254\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.000\n&gt;&gt; So Wes I guess all we'd have to\ndo is actually re-run the task list\n\n255\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.500\ncommand right?\n\n256\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n257\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.660\nSo let's go ahead and what we'll do\nis we'll clear the screen up and\n\n258\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.749\nwe'll re-run that.\n\n259\n00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.790\nSo, we've got a nice clean canvas here.\n\n260\n00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.310\nLet's go ahead and do a task list.\n\n261\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.220\nAnd we'll do a forward slash.\n\n262\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.550\nAnd we'll do that filter option again,\n\n263\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.468\njust to make sure that it's\na little easier to find.\n\n264\n00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:00.310\nAnd we'll do,\n\n265\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.440\nagain I don't think that it's case\nsensitive when you're in the quotes here,\n\n266\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.010\nbut just in case I'll run it just like\nthey show within the options there.\n\n267\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.970\nWe'll run it.\n\n268\n00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.020\nAnd notice that sure enough,\nour ZoomIt option,\n\n269\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.273\nthe pid, the process identifier's a little\ndifferent on the second ZoomIt.exe there.\n\n270\n00:13:18.273 --> 00:13:20.125\nBut the first one is gone.\n\n271\n00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:23.840\nSo great little command to have,\ngood command to know, and\n\n272\n00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.110\ndefinitely know it for the exam.\n\n273\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.970\nNow there is some other\ncommands in here that also show\n\n274\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.940\nyou basic navigation, right?\n\n275\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.150\nThey show you the contents of folders,\nthey show you how to move\n\n276\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.220\naround in locations, make folders,\nthey're called directories as well.\n\n277\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.050\nKeep in mind that before they were\nfolders, they were directories, right, and\n\n278\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.200\nthat we say that because a file\nhierarchy would have, well, containers,\n\n279\n00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.140\nthe containers would be\ncalled directories and\n\n280\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.800\ninside the directories we could put files.\n\n281\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.230\nWhen the graphical user\ninterfaces became more famous,\n\n282\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.970\nthey would make them these\nnice colorful little folders.\n\n283\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.710\nBut folders and\ndirectories are one and the same.\n\n284\n00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.426\nBut it allows us to move around\nwithin the file hierarchy.\n\n285\n00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:05.220\nAll right, so let's talk about\nthe first one that lets us see what's\n\n286\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.740\nIn the current location that we're at.\n\n287\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.480\nAnd I'm talking about the dir command.\n\n288\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.890\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll look in our current location.\n\n289\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.330\nSo let me go ahead and use this, right?\n\n290\n00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:19.380\nSo if I do a dir in system32 here\nit's gonna show me all the files.\n\n291\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.990\nNow this one probably really isn't a good\n\n292\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.990\none to show just because when I run this,\nboy.\n\n293\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.190\nThere is a lot of different files and\nfolders in here, right?\n\n294\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.930\nSo dir, if you will, is directory and\n\n295\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.490\nit lists the current\ndirectory that you're in.\n\n296\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.800\nLet me give you one that's\na little bit smaller here, and\n\n297\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.560\nyou can actually run a dir\non a specific location.\n\n298\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.890\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nclear the screen here.\n\n299\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.110\nI'd like to do that to make\nsure that it's easier to see.\n\n300\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.460\nI can do dir, right?\n\n301\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.650\nAnd I could point it to a certain\nfolder or directory if I want.\n\n302\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.450\nIn this case, I could say,\n\n303\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.650\nhey I wanna see all the user\nprofiles that exist on this machine.\n\n304\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.250\nI could say dir and\nthen point it to that location.\n\n305\n00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:02.170\nAnd when I run it, essentially you can see\nthat it's showing me that location, right?\n\n306\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.220\nIt's showing me the contents\nof that folder.\n\n307\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.020\nAnd that's really good to have.\n\n308\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:06.930\nSo that's what dir is.\n\n309\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.860\nIt can show you the current location\njust by running it by itself or\n\n310\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.730\nit could show you a specific location\nby pointing it to the path if you will,\n\n311\n00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.380\nto wherever is that you want to look.\n\n312\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.816\nNow the other one that we have is\nwhat's known as the CD command.\n\n313\n00:15:19.816 --> 00:15:24.370\nNow the CD command understand, is not\nreally a Windows-specific type of command.\n\n314\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.660\nThis actually goes back and\nharkens back to Unix, and Unix and\n\n315\n00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.510\nDOS if you will, and it's in most of the\noperating systems that we have today, but\n\n316\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.270\nit's still here in Windows,\nso let me show you here.\n\n317\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.129\nCD allows you to change your directories,\nright?\n\n318\n00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:41.901\nAnd if I do cCD and\nI don't run it with anything else,\n\n319\n00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:43.860\nit says well what do you want me to do?\n\n320\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.580\nI'll just keep you right where I'm at.\n\n321\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.800\nBut you can also kind of back out\nto the parent directory, you know,\n\n322\n00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.410\nthe directory that's right before,\n\n323\n00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.180\nin this case System32,\nits parent directory would be Windows.\n\n324\n00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.212\nWe could do a CD.., right?\n\n325\n00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:59.981\nAnd we can back out to just\none level in the hierarchy.\n\n326\n00:15:59.981 --> 00:16:04.930\nOr we can do a CD And we could type\na folder within the current directory and\n\n327\n00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:10.630\nwe wouldn't need the full path for this,\nwe could go back to system32 if we want.\n\n328\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.720\nIn fact, there's a lot of folders in\nthere, let me narrow it down here.\n\n329\n00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.460\nI could go back into system32 and\n\n330\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.890\nnotice that I’m moving around inside\nof the directory structure here.\n\n331\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.690\nAll right, I’m gonna clear my\nscreen out so I can do a CD.\n\n332\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.970\nIf I wanna go all the way back to the\nstarting point, what we call the root of\n\n333\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.960\nthis drive, in this case the parent\nof everything would be C:,\n\n334\n00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.150\nI could just do a CD/ and\nthat takes me, oops.\n\n335\n00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.350\nSorry about that,\ntyped that a little bit wrong.\n\n336\n00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.010\nBut that allows me to go all\nthe way back to the root so\n\n337\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.620\nthat's a great thing to have.\n\n338\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.820\nNow you could type\nthe full path out right.\n\n339\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:50.930\nI could say okay CD space and we can do\nsomething like C colon users backslash.\n\n340\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.020\nI'm logged in as administrator and I\ncould go all the way to my desktop right.\n\n341\n00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.020\nAnd I could navigate right there.\n\n342\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.150\nSo you can do the full path as well.\n\n343\n00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.070\nSome of the other commands that we have\nhere in the list that we also need to be\n\n344\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.590\naware of are for\ninstance we have what's known as MD.\n\n345\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.030\nThat's make a directory right.\n\n346\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:10.970\nSo when you do that,\n\n347\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.520\nunderstand that there are some earlier\nUnix commands that still apply to this.\n\n348\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.790\nSo let me show you here what I mean.\n\n349\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.820\nSo I have the MD option, and\nagain keep in mind this'll\n\n350\n00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.020\nshow you that we're working with Windows\nhere without the graphical user interface.\n\n351\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.500\nIf I do md and I do test,\nnotice what'll appear here on my desktop.\n\n352\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.690\nNotice a little folder.\n\n353\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.880\nAnd if I do a dir that\nshows me the directory.\n\n354\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.890\nI could see that command\nprompt calls it a directory.\n\n355\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.740\nThat's why I say folders and directories\nare one and the same inside of Windows.\n\n356\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.550\nDon't let that confuse you on the exam.\n\n357\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.170\nNow what if I wanted\nto remove a directory?\n\n358\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.430\nNow that's where the RD\ndirective comes in right?\n\n359\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.480\nI can choose RD and\nI could point it to specific location.\n\n360\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.620\n&gt;&gt; Like C.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, yeah.\n\n361\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.360\nDon't delete C Drive,\nI don't care what Dan says.\n\n362\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.930\nWell actually get a bunch of access\ndenied and override and stuff like that,\n\n363\n00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.030\nbut you could.\n\n364\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.720\nYou could point it to a location, so\nI want you to give, here's the full path,\n\n365\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.810\ndelete this directory or if you're already\nin that directory like we are now on\n\n366\n00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:14.495\nthe desk top all I'd have to do is CD and\nI could just type, the word test.\n\n367\n00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:17.965\nIn this case, the name of the directory\nand you can see, it is gone.\n\n368\n00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:22.535\nNow let me show you real quick that mkdir,\nI don't know if they're gonna ask you on\n\n369\n00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:25.975\nthat, on the exam if\nthey're gonna ask you that.\n\n370\n00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:30.715\nBut you could do that as well and\nyou do have to put the space in there.\n\n371\n00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:33.835\nNotice that that also works,\nthere's that test directory too.\n\n372\n00:18:33.835 --> 00:18:36.575\nAnd again, that's Harkins back\nto the earlier days of Unix.\n\n373\n00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:44.330\nYou can also do Remove, and that would\nnot rd, that would be rm, I believe, dir.\n\n374\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.850\n&gt;&gt; Just rm.\n\n375\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:46.490\n&gt;&gt; Is it rm?\n\n376\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it'll work,\n\n377\n00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.280\nI don't know if rm works.\n\n378\n00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.160\nYeah but.\n\n379\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I did like that.\n\n380\n00:18:52.915 --> 00:18:55.390\n&gt;&gt; rmdir_test and it works.\n\n381\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.190\nYeah.\n\n382\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Rm dir must be windows specific.\n\n383\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.380\n&gt;&gt; It could be dos.\n\n384\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It could go back to MS-DOS,\n\n385\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.710\nit's one of those ones, it's been around\nfor a while so that lets me tell,\n\n386\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.850\ncuz I know you know the Unix command,\nso that lets me know that what that was\n\n387\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.830\nis an MS-DOS that it's still\nleft behind more than anything.\n\n388\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.420\nSo let me go ahead we'll\nclear this screen up.\n\n389\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.160\nSo that's kinda some of\nthe navigations that you can do.\n\n390\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.420\nYou can also do things like copy files and\nyou can delete files.\n\n391\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.710\nLet me show you what I mean, you've\ngot what's known as the copy command.\n\n392\n00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.290\nAnd if I use the copy command,\nin fact let's use our CD and\n\n393\n00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.760\nwe'll go dot dot here,\nwe're gonna back up.\n\n394\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.970\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nchange my directory to documents.\n\n395\n00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.070\nSo all we're doing is kinda\nmoving around here and\n\n396\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.610\nif I do a DIR,\nnotice that I got a text file here.\n\n397\n00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.020\nWell, maybe I wanna see that\ntext file on the desktop.\n\n398\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.760\nWell, I can do a copy and\nI could name the file.\n\n399\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.130\nIn this case, I'm doing copy\nmytextfile.txt, gotta spell the extension.\n\n400\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:59.200\nAnd my head's gonna kinda cover this\nup and I don't know if it did copy.\n\n401\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.680\nThat's not the way you do that.\n\n402\n00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.490\nLet's try that again.\n\n403\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.330\nSo I could copy it,\nin fact let me clear the screen here.\n\n404\n00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.390\nWe could do a copy and\nwe could do mytextfile.\n\n405\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.610\nAnd then I could name whatever\nthe location is, I could tell it the path.\n\n406\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.740\nIn this case I'm gonna copy\nit to my desktop here.\n\n407\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.540\nAnd I know we're kinda getting\nready to word wrap here.\n\n408\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.850\nBut I'll copy it to the desktop.\n\n409\n00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.560\nAnd you might notice that they're\nunder the recycle bin and\n\n410\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.130\nthere sure enough appears the text file.\n\n411\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:33.000\nAnd I can enter something\nlike type mytextfile and\n\n412\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.970\nI can see that this information, right.\n\n413\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.140\nI can see the information that's\ninside of the text file, right.\n\n414\n00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.840\nThis is a text file for\nthe copy and delete command.\n\n415\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.840\nSo Dan based on that text, what do you\nthink the text to command might be?\n\n416\n00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.610\nThat's copy.\n\n417\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.800\n&gt;&gt; Probably move.\n\n418\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Move [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n420\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.100\none of the things that we can do\nis we can also move as well too.\n\n421\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.270\nMaybe I don't want to make a copy right,\n\n422\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.450\ncuz now I've got it in\ntwo different locations.\n\n423\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.110\nMaybe I want to move it\nto a location right.\n\n424\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.290\nWell we can also do that to.\n\n425\n00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.050\nWe can do a move right.\n\n426\n00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.730\nHere's one of the things to keep in mind.\n\n427\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.960\nIf I'm not in that location I\nhave to give the full path.\n\n428\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.020\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to kind of cheat here.\n\n429\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.670\nI'm going to do cd ..\n\n430\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.180\ngo back to the parent and\ndo cd again desktop,\n\n431\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.030\nkind of move where I want to\nmove in the current location.\n\n432\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.500\nIt makes it easier for typing for me.\n\n433\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.490\nSo I can say move.\n\n434\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.150\nRight, and I could say mytextfile, and\n\n435\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.370\nwe could say something like C:\\Users,\n\n436\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:32.080\nmaybe I wanna put this in the documents\nfolder of another user, right?\n\n437\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.630\nAnd moved, it's there.\n\n438\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.970\nAnd if we wanted to verify\nthat we could always do a dir.\n\n439\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.220\n&gt;&gt; And we did see it disappear\nfrom the desktop, so\n\n440\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.850\nit's definitely not there anymore.\n\n441\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.240\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nthat's a great thing to also mention.\n\n442\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.950\nThere's no copies here, it's gone, right?\n\n443\n00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.700\nWe put it where we want it.\n\n444\n00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it moved it.\n\n445\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.749\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's great too if you're\nin a command prompt situation where you\n\n446\n00:21:49.749 --> 00:21:51.678\nneed to move a driver around and\nyou need to move a driver around,\n\n447\n00:21:51.678 --> 00:21:52.520\nyou can move it, drive it.\n\n448\n00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you don't drive it anywhere.\n\n449\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.570\nMove it to the appropriate location.\n\n450\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:02.810\nSo let's go ahead and do our dir, admin,\nwe'll go ahead and look at documents.\n\n451\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.780\nAnd let's find out what's in there.\n\n452\n00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.554\nAnd sure enough that text file you.\n\n453\n00:22:07.554 --> 00:22:09.336\nOops you can't see [LAUGH].\n\n454\n00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:09.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n455\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.179\n&gt;&gt; Launches the modern UI is right there.\n\n456\n00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:15.360\nGetting a little click happy\nwith the keyboard here,\n\n457\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.170\nbut those are some of the commands\nthat you can use as well.\n\n458\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.770\nYou can also use things like\nthe delete command if you will.\n\n459\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.710\nDoes exactly what it says,\nwill delete the file too.\n\n460\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.630\nOther things that you can use\nmaybe you need a little bit more\n\n461\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.630\npower behind your copy command, right?\n\n462\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.340\nCopy is very basic,\ndoesn't do things like permissions and\n\n463\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.460\naccess control list and\nit certainly isn't good for\n\n464\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.160\nscripting because it doesn't do\nwell with things like errors.\n\n465\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.540\nWell that's where another copy\ncommand comes in, things like xcopy.\n\n466\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.420\nAnd if you ever need to get into\nyou know find out how to use it,\n\n467\n00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.700\nremember you can always do your\nforward slash question mark but again,\n\n468\n00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.950\nit allows you to exclude files and\nstuff like that and\n\n469\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.890\noverwrite read only files, copy and things\nlike hidden files and system files too.\n\n470\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.330\nSo it's got a lot more power.\n\n471\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.790\nAnd if you need even more power than that,\nthat's where you get Robocopy.\n\n472\n00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.316\nPeter Weller's copy [INAUDIBLE].\n\n473\n00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:06.330\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] all copy machines.\n\n474\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.690\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n475\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.380\nSo keep in mind,\nyou can also use Robocopy and\n\n476\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.890\nthen what that does is that's It's really\ngood for scripting because it also not\n\n477\n00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:17.540\nonly does well with errors, but\nit will continue to move on in the script.\n\n478\n00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.090\nYou don't have to worry about scripting\nby any means for the A+ level.\n\n479\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.720\nJust know that is a command\nin the list as well.\n\n480\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.080\nOther commands that we have,\nwe have things like DiskPart.\n\n481\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.200\nDiskPart is it's own disk utility,\ndisk maintenance utility.\n\n482\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.070\nOr disk partitioning utility, if you will.\n\n483\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.190\nAnd if we run that, let me show you here.\n\n484\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.470\nDisk part is actually an executable.\n\n485\n00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.570\nAnd when it runs,\n\n486\n00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.710\nit allows you to basically maintain\nthe disks that you have in the machine.\n\n487\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.420\nSo I could do something like list disk,\nand I could see the hard drives.\n\n488\n00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.920\nIf I've got volumes created,\nwe could do things like creating volumes.\n\n489\n00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.389\nSo I could do, for instance,\na list volume if I wanted.\n\n490\n00:23:56.389 --> 00:23:57.702\nNotice that I have different volumes.\n\n491\n00:23:57.702 --> 00:24:02.823\nAnd again, it allows you to make, modify,\nand format things like your drives.\n\n492\n00:24:02.823 --> 00:24:08.309\nWhich also brings me, and I'll go ahead\nand exit out of this and clear the screen.\n\n493\n00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:10.576\nAnd let's give us a little\nmore real estate there.\n\n494\n00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:12.130\nYou could also run things like format.\n\n495\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:17.306\nThere is a format, excuse me,\nformat.exe, that is in here.\n\n496\n00:24:17.306 --> 00:24:20.859\nAnd if you need to know how to run that,\nyou can run this as well.\n\n497\n00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.180\nThis allows you to format drives\nto a specific file system.\n\n498\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.876\nAgain, you can see,\nyou can define things like tracks,\n\n499\n00:24:29.876 --> 00:24:32.189\ncounters, sectors, if you will.\n\n500\n00:24:32.189 --> 00:24:34.229\nSo be aware of that on the exam.\n\n501\n00:24:34.229 --> 00:24:36.540\nCouple of the other ones that we have,\nas well.\n\n502\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.232\nWe have things like gpupdate and gpresult,\n\n503\n00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:40.849\nthese are gonna be things that\nare gonna be in a domain environment.\n\n504\n00:24:40.849 --> 00:24:45.301\nWe look at a domain environment,\nwhat that's gonna mean is you've got\n\n505\n00:24:45.301 --> 00:24:50.124\na Windows Professional or Enterprise or\nBusiness type edition, and it is now\n\n506\n00:24:50.124 --> 00:24:55.550\ninside of a corporate-based network and\nit is controlled by Active Directory.\n\n507\n00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.387\nLet me show you here.\n\n508\n00:24:56.387 --> 00:25:01.387\nThere in Active Directory, again, it gives\nyou the ability to push settings and\n\n509\n00:25:01.387 --> 00:25:03.152\npolicies out to computers so\n\n510\n00:25:03.152 --> 00:25:07.212\nthat the administrator can control\nthe computing environment.\n\n511\n00:25:07.212 --> 00:25:09.654\nAnd if you needed for any reason to see or\n\n512\n00:25:09.654 --> 00:25:14.465\nto maybe communicate with that computer\nout there and apply those settings,\n\n513\n00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:18.335\nyou could do a gpupdate,\nsomething like, space, /force.\n\n514\n00:25:18.335 --> 00:25:22.897\nAnd what it would do is it would update\nthe policy, it'd talk to that computer and\n\n515\n00:25:22.897 --> 00:25:24.925\nsay, hey, are there any changes?\n\n516\n00:25:24.925 --> 00:25:32.096\nNow, I don't have a network adapter in\nthis where it's connected currently.\n\n517\n00:25:32.096 --> 00:25:34.441\nWe're gonna talk about\nnetwork connectivity,\n\n518\n00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:38.339\nwe're gonna talk about joining domains\nhere in our client networking episode.\n\n519\n00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:40.320\nBut understand that it would be there.\n\n520\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.947\nThe other one that you have\nis what's known as gpresult.\n\n521\n00:25:42.947 --> 00:25:48.248\nIf you need to find out what are the\nsettings that are currently applying,\n\n522\n00:25:48.248 --> 00:25:50.510\nyou can always find gpresult.\n\n523\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.944\nYou could use something like the gpresult,\nspace, /r, and\n\n524\n00:25:53.944 --> 00:25:56.462\nthat would show you\nwhat's known as an RSoP.\n\n525\n00:25:56.462 --> 00:25:59.540\nThat's something called a result and\nsetup policy.\n\n526\n00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.287\nIt just lets me know, hey, what are the\nsettings that are currently applied?\n\n527\n00:26:03.287 --> 00:26:05.590\nWhat groups am I a part of?\n\n528\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.795\nWhat policies are applying?\n\n529\n00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:10.408\nSo, another great one to have.\n\n530\n00:26:10.408 --> 00:26:12.510\nOne that I'm not gonna\nrun right here [LAUGH],\n\n531\n00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.343\nbecause it would pretty much\nend our episode, is shutdown.\n\n532\n00:26:15.343 --> 00:26:17.652\n[LAUGH] You could shut down\nyour computer as well.\n\n533\n00:26:17.652 --> 00:26:18.620\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what that does?\n\n534\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.105\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n535\n00:26:20.105 --> 00:26:21.717\nYou could shut down your\ncomputer from inside of\n\n536\n00:26:21.717 --> 00:26:22.899\nthe command prompt if you need to.\n\n537\n00:26:22.899 --> 00:26:25.205\nI will show you one.\n\n538\n00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:27.051\nLet me show you this one,\nthis one's in the list.\n\n539\n00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:29.663\nAnd that's called exit.\n\n540\n00:26:29.663 --> 00:26:32.728\nI do have people ask me,\nfrom time to time,\n\n541\n00:26:32.728 --> 00:26:36.231\nshould I use that to shut\ndown my command prompt?\n\n542\n00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:40.721\nAnd they give you the red x button for\na reason, you don't actually have to.\n\n543\n00:26:40.721 --> 00:26:43.130\nLast few things that I wanna\ntalk about real quick,\n\n544\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.102\nthey talk about these run line commands.\n\n545\n00:26:45.102 --> 00:26:49.402\nRun line commands are ones that would be\nentered into the traditional run line.\n\n546\n00:26:49.402 --> 00:26:54.240\nNow, you don't see that right here anymore\ninside of things like Windows 8.1, but\n\n547\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.364\nyou will see it in the Start menu and\nit does still exist.\n\n548\n00:26:57.364 --> 00:27:01.917\nThe way you use it in Windows 8 and\n8.1 is really from your modern UI, and\n\n549\n00:27:01.917 --> 00:27:03.232\nlet me show you here.\n\n550\n00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:05.726\nFrom your modern UI,\nthis is kinda like your run line,\n\n551\n00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:07.800\nthey kinda integrated\nit into the modern UI.\n\n552\n00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.114\nBut there are a certain set of\nrun line commands that I want you\n\n553\n00:27:12.114 --> 00:27:13.392\nto be able to run.\n\n554\n00:27:13.392 --> 00:27:16.460\nYou will notice that if you try\nto run these in command prompt,\n\n555\n00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.460\nthey'll work as well.\n\n556\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.430\nThe traditional run line,\nyou can get to by doing a Windows key+R.\n\n557\n00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.910\nAnd here is what I mean by run line.\n\n558\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.898\nOne of them that's already in there is\nperfmon, that's a performance monitor.\n\n559\n00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:32.376\nWe've got some that we can run,\nlike, for instance, regedit,\n\n560\n00:27:32.376 --> 00:27:35.580\nand you can see that it's\nalready in the list there.\n\n561\n00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.377\nI can run regedit.exe, and\nthat runs my registry editor.\n\n562\n00:27:40.377 --> 00:27:44.620\nThere is a slight variance on\nthat one that we can also run.\n\n563\n00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.762\nThis was from earlier days of Windows.\n\n564\n00:27:47.762 --> 00:27:52.150\nThis is regedt32.exe.\n\n565\n00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.395\nAnd if I run that today,\nit just runs the same exact program.\n\n566\n00:27:55.395 --> 00:27:56.851\nThey kept it around because so\n\n567\n00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:59.541\nmany people from the older\ndays were used to seeing it.\n\n568\n00:27:59.541 --> 00:28:03.554\nWe have other things too, like, for\ninstance, if I am running a run line,\n\n569\n00:28:03.554 --> 00:28:07.146\nI can run things like our services\nconsole, I could do a services.\n\n570\n00:28:07.146 --> 00:28:09.659\nNot everything is in .exe,\nplease keep that in mind.\n\n571\n00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:13.819\nSome things are what are known as\nMicrosoft consoles, Microsoft service or\n\n572\n00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.123\nmanagement consoles.\n\n573\n00:28:15.123 --> 00:28:19.838\nYou can see they are files that\nare saved with an .msc extension.\n\n574\n00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:22.003\nSo services happens to be one of those.\n\n575\n00:28:22.003 --> 00:28:26.173\nAnd when I run that, well, wouldn't you\nknow, it runs a program that we're gonna\n\n576\n00:28:26.173 --> 00:28:29.110\ntalk about in our administrative\ntools called services.\n\n577\n00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:34.248\nSome of the other ones that they have,\ntoo, if you need to run things\n\n578\n00:28:34.248 --> 00:28:39.570\nlike Remote Desktop,\nyou have what's known as mstsc.exe, again,\n\n579\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:45.550\nis one that you can run and it will run\nyour Windows Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n580\n00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.162\nA few of the other ones that are in here,\nnotepad, that runs Notepad,\n\n581\n00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:50.706\n[LAUGH] imagine that, right?\n\n582\n00:28:50.706 --> 00:28:53.689\nOther ones, you have explorer,\nthat will run your Windows Explorer.\n\n583\n00:28:53.689 --> 00:28:56.780\nIf you're in Windows 8 and\n8.1, that's File Explorer.\n\n584\n00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.396\nYou also have msinfo32,\n\n585\n00:28:58.396 --> 00:29:03.396\nnow, we're gonna talk about this in our\nadministrative tools and utilities show.\n\n586\n00:29:03.396 --> 00:29:06.420\nThat runs the system\nconfiguration utility.\n\n587\n00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.799\nYou also have what's known as DxDiag.\n\n588\n00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:11.830\nDxDiag is the DirectX diagnostic utility.\n\n589\n00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.620\nThose of you out there that have XBox,\nwell, guess what?\n\n590\n00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.711\nXBox gets its name from the DirectX\ngraphics technology that forms\n\n591\n00:29:18.711 --> 00:29:22.350\nthe foundation for\nWindows graphic solutions.\n\n592\n00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.712\nAnd when they decided to come out with\na console, they got with the DirectX team,\n\n593\n00:29:25.712 --> 00:29:28.975\nand the DirectX team got with their\narchitects and engineers, and they said,\n\n594\n00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.668\nokay, we're gonna make this console.\n\n595\n00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:36.832\nAnd rather than call it the DirectXbox,\nthey just took the word Direct out of it.\n\n596\n00:29:36.832 --> 00:29:39.827\nSo that's where, believe it or\nnot, Xbox gets its name.\n\n597\n00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:43.570\nDxDiag will allow you\nto test that subsystem.\n\n598\n00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:47.069\nYou also have the ability to launch\nyour disk defragmenter, too.\n\n599\n00:29:47.069 --> 00:29:49.470\nKeep in mind you also have defrag.exe.\n\n600\n00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:54.507\nNow, I'll also say that, be careful,\nbecause defrag.exe, it also runs\n\n601\n00:29:54.507 --> 00:29:59.641\ninside of the command prompt and\nhas a command-based utility, if you will.\n\n602\n00:29:59.641 --> 00:30:01.096\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So you can do this through\n\n603\n00:30:01.096 --> 00:30:04.591\nthe graphical user interface, you can\ndo this through command line as well.\n\n604\n00:30:04.591 --> 00:30:07.329\nSo, run line commands,\nreally, really good to have.\n\n605\n00:30:07.329 --> 00:30:11.240\nI'll tell you one last one that I\nuse probably, when I'm in Windows,\n\n606\n00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.645\nalmost on a daily basis.\n\n607\n00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:14.695\nLet me go ahead and show you this one.\n\n608\n00:30:14.695 --> 00:30:17.266\n&gt;&gt; That is your good old\nComputer Management.\n\n609\n00:30:17.266 --> 00:30:20.621\nAgain, we're gonna talk more about\nthese actual utilities coming up in\n\n610\n00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:21.501\nanother episode.\n\n611\n00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:26.747\nBut compmgmt.msc will launch\nthe one-stop shop convenience store for\n\n612\n00:30:26.747 --> 00:30:31.133\njust about any utility that you\ncan commonly think of to use,\n\n613\n00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:35.956\nalmost on a daily basis,\ninside of the Windows operating system.\n\n614\n00:30:35.956 --> 00:30:39.129\nJust making sure that you remember\nwhat those run line commands are.\n\n615\n00:30:39.129 --> 00:30:42.992\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well,\nwe cannot call ourselves masters or\n\n616\n00:30:42.992 --> 00:30:47.992\ncomputer technicians if are weak in one\narea on which we can actually work, and\n\n617\n00:30:47.992 --> 00:30:51.579\nthat can be in the command line or\nin the run line option.\n\n618\n00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:55.278\nSo you've gotta be familiar with those,\nbecause you never know when those things\n\n619\n00:30:55.278 --> 00:30:57.434\nare actually the right tool for\nthe job at hand.\n\n620\n00:30:57.434 --> 00:31:01.566\nSo be on the lookout for\nthose types of commands.\n\n621\n00:31:01.566 --> 00:31:02.239\nWes, thanks for\n\n622\n00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:04.986\nteaching us all the commands that\nmight actually pop up on our exam.\n\n623\n00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:05.493\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n624\n00:31:05.493 --> 00:31:07.221\nit looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n625\n00:31:07.221 --> 00:31:09.548\nDon't worry, though,\nwe've got plenty more to come,\n\n626\n00:31:09.548 --> 00:31:11.006\ndefinitely stick with us for that.\n\n627\n00:31:11.006 --> 00:31:13.878\nWe do appreciate you joining us today,\nbut it is time to sign off.\n\n628\n00:31:13.878 --> 00:31:16.262\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n629\n00:31:16.262 --> 00:31:16.979\nAnd I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n630\n00:31:16.979 --> 00:31:18.292\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n631\n00:31:22.534 --> 00:31:25.506\n[MUSIC]\n\n632\n00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:28.348\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:13.822\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:17.010\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.780\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.250\nwell, brace yourself cuz we're back\nwith more of our A+ Accelerated, right,\n\n7\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.940\nthat's been a lot of fun so far.\n\n8\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.782\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto help hammer the gas back down,\n\n9\n00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:30.360\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.270\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.510\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\n\n12\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.600\nit's been real fun being here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.720\nAnd thanks for having me here too.\n\n14\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.280\nThat's right, we are at 1,000 horsepower\non this one, so let's go ahead and\n\n15\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.910\ndive in.\n\n16\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.950\nAnd we'll get right to the point.\n\n17\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.150\nWe're gonna be talking about,\nwell, Windows tools.\n\n18\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.844\nWe're gonna also be talking\nabout the control panel.\n\n19\n00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.800\nWhat is a Control Panel?\n\n20\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.290\nWell, a Control Panel really, for average\nusers, might be something they've never\n\n21\n00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.080\nseen and if it's the first time\nyou're really working in Windows and\n\n22\n00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.550\nmaybe supporting it,\nyou might not have seen it either.\n\n23\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.430\nIt is pretty much one of the primary\ninterfaces that you have for\n\n24\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.160\nnavigating around all the different\nutilities that you will use to manage\n\n25\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.450\nyour Windows environment.\n\n26\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.680\nNow, understand that the utilities that\nwe're gonna look at do require you to\n\n27\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.490\nhave administrative level access.\n\n28\n00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.621\nNot necessarily for\nsome just to see them, but\n\n29\n00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.933\nto use some of them you will have to be\nan administrator versus a standard user.\n\n30\n00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.189\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe are gonna dive right in, and\n\n31\n00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.575\none of the first things I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna talk about Control Panel,\n\n32\n00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:27.303\nwe're gonna come back towards the end and\ntalk about the actual utilities and tools.\n\n33\n00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:31.866\nBut I do wanna mention some things about\nControl Panel because for the most part,\n\n34\n00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.820\nas you go through the different\noperating systems,\n\n35\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.592\nControl Panel really\nhasn't changed too much.\n\n36\n00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:41.170\nReally, going back to the days of XP\nit hasn't changed too much, either.\n\n37\n00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.600\nOnce you know exactly,\nit's just some of the minor differences,\n\n38\n00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.130\nnow these minor differences\nare important on the exam.\n\n39\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.513\nYou might say, well Wes, boy, you're\ngetting really picky with some of these.\n\n40\n00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:56.525\nYes, I am, because, remember on the exam\nthey might give you a text-based answer?\n\n41\n00:01:56.525 --> 00:02:00.500\nAnd that text-based answer might be all\nyou have to get the answer right and\n\n42\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.320\nyou might not have any kind of exhibit or\nscreen shot or\n\n43\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.550\nany interactive performance-based\nsimulation so, text does matter, right?\n\n44\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.241\nThese are gonna be some things that\nI just wanna kind of point out here.\n\n45\n00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:16.302\nNow in some of the episodes we've\nbeen working with Windows 8, 8.1,\n\n46\n00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.400\nwe've been working with\nour Windows 7 machines.\n\n47\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.440\nBut I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n48\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.260\nI'm gonna kind of jump around between\ntwo different interfaces here.\n\n49\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.410\nBetween Windows 7 and Windows,\nif you will, windows 8.1.\n\n50\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.533\nAnd just kinda show you that for the most\npart, things have stayed the same.\n\n51\n00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:36.980\nAnd I'm gonna mention something\nthat has changed that's in Vista.\n\n52\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.830\nAnd you can just basically, when you're\nstudying, make sure that you check it out.\n\n53\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.111\nLet's go ahead, we'll dive into\nour Windows 7 machine here.\n\n54\n00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:49.538\nAnd if I need to get to control panel,\nit's as simple as pushing the start\n\n55\n00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:53.691\nbutton, and right there on the Start Menu,\nwe have Control Panel.\n\n56\n00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:57.260\nNow, notice that we\nhave our Control Panel.\n\n57\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.648\nThat's one of the first things you\nwanna know how we get here, right?\n\n58\n00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:06.861\nBut if I\"m in a Windows 8.1 machine,\nI don't have a Start Menu, right?\n\n59\n00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:09.140\nWell, there's a couple of\nthings that you can do.\n\n60\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.140\nFrom the modern UI you would\njust type control, right?\n\n61\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.050\nAnd thank goodness it even\nunderstands my typos too,\n\n62\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.150\nwe can launch Control Panel from here.\n\n63\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.425\nNow the other way that you can get\nto it is if you go to the desktop,\n\n64\n00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:27.494\nyou can right-click the Windows tile and\nin this administrative quick links,\n\n65\n00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:29.518\nyou have the Control Panel here, too.\n\n66\n00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:33.930\nNow when I open this, understand that they\ndon't really look too much different.\n\n67\n00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.010\nAnd that's the great thing.\n\n68\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.200\nAnd that's one of the things\nbetween these two interfaces.\n\n69\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.450\nNotice that for the most part,\nthey're almost identical, right?\n\n70\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.450\nI mean, maybe just a little bit,\n\n71\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.540\nwith File Explorer around the edges\nthey've changed a little bit.\n\n72\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.770\nI'm gonna go ahead and give you\na little exam alert about Vista, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.300\nWith Vista, this very first\ncategory doesn't say System and\n\n74\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.060\nSecurity, it says System and Maintenance.\n\n75\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.168\nAgain, you're saying Wes,\n\n76\n00:03:59.168 --> 00:04:01.530\nwait a second here,\nyou're really getting specific on that.\n\n77\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.411\nWell, if they ask you a question and\n\n78\n00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:10.382\nthe scenario says you're supporting\na Windows Vista Business Edition?\n\n79\n00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:13.943\nSystem and Security in Control Panel's\nnot gonna be the right answer.\n\n80\n00:04:13.943 --> 00:04:16.570\nThat's for Windows 7,\nWindows 8, Windows 8.1.\n\n81\n00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.960\nDoes that make sense out there?\n\n82\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.580\nJust follow along with me, and\nI want you to know, pay attention.\n\n83\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.650\n&gt;&gt; Follow the bouncing ball.\n\n84\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right, follow the bouncing ball.\n\n85\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.285\nFollow the bouncing virtual machine,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:31.210\nThey're not really too much different,\nokay?\n\n87\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.620\nSo that being said, I’m gonna go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.890\nI’m gonna jump back over\nto our Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n89\n00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.450\nJust wanted to show you\nthe minor differences in how\n\n90\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.010\nyou would get to Control Panel.\n\n91\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.590\nNow one of the things that Windows Vista\nand Windows 7 share is that it's Start,\n\n92\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.510\nand then Control Panel from\nthe Start Menu, right?\n\n93\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.130\nWell, it's slightly different here.\n\n94\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.269\nInside of Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n95\n00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:54.726\nAll right, now that being said,\nthey call that Administrative Tools, and\n\n96\n00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:57.380\nwe have to talk about some of\nthese Administrative Tools.\n\n97\n00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.318\nNow these Administrative Tools are found\ninside of Control Panel, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:05.580\nSo how do we find these?\n\n99\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.030\nAll right, well let me show you the screen\nhere, if we are in Control Panel already,\n\n100\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.400\nlike we've just shown you.\n\n101\n00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.810\nAnd we go to System and Security.\n\n102\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.740\nYou're gonna notice that down here at\nthe bottom we have Administrative Tools.\n\n103\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.796\nNow that is the same thing regardless of\nVista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1.\n\n104\n00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:25.090\nJust remember that system and\nmaintenance is different.\n\n105\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.725\nThat's really the one that's just\ndifferent and will catch you up.\n\n106\n00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:30.890\nBut once you click System and\nMaintenance or System and Security and\n\n107\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.520\nall the other ones, just scroll to\nthe bottom, you got Administrative Tools.\n\n108\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.820\nThere are a series of\nadministrative tools that you\n\n109\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.890\npotentially could need to\nknow about on the exam.\n\n110\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.840\nSo let's talk about some of those.\n\n111\n00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.014\nNow the very first one we have\nthat we have to talk about, and\n\n112\n00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:50.110\nI'm gonna do them in order of objective,\nguys.\n\n113\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.030\nRather than this list that they have here,\n\n114\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.200\ncuz we don't need all of\nthose that are in this list.\n\n115\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.050\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.780\nThey talk about computer management.\n\n117\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.810\nAll right,\ncomputer management is a great utility.\n\n118\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.150\nAnd yes you can launch it\ninside of administrative tools.\n\n119\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.470\nThe other way that you can launch it,\n\n120\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.420\nwe talked about in another\nepisode is command line, right.\n\n121\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.101\nYou can type in a runline command, right.\n\n122\n00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:19.390\nYou can type in COMPMGMT.MSC.\n\n123\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.030\nCould also do a Windows key R that\nwould bring up your Windows key and\n\n124\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.690\nI could type that here and\nthat would launch computer management.\n\n125\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.224\nThe other thing you could do is from\nfile explore if you're in Windows 8 and\n\n126\n00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.214\n8.1 it's called Windows Explorer\nin Vista and Windows 7.\n\n127\n00:06:34.214 --> 00:06:37.971\nYou could look over here in the file\nhierarchy and you could right click and\n\n128\n00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.290\nyou could choose Manage, all right?\n\n129\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.300\nAnd that would also launch\ncomputer management.\n\n130\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.380\nNow one thing that is a little bit\ndifferent that I'm gonna kinda switch\n\n131\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.490\nover back to our Windows\n7 machine real quick.\n\n132\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.400\nIs that you also have\nan other option that we don't\n\n133\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.040\nhave in Windows 8.1 because they\ntook away the start menu, right?\n\n134\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.050\nSo in this then, Windows 7, on the Start\nMenu, you could also right click and\n\n135\n00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.230\nchoose Manage.\n\n136\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.650\nAnd guess what?\n\n137\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.350\nThat's also going to bring\nup your computer management.\n\n138\n00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.560\nSo, a couple of different\nways to get to it.\n\n139\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.590\nI know we're talking about\nadministrative tools here.\n\n140\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.000\nThis an administrative tool and\n\n141\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.620\nI want you to know multiple\nways to get there because.\n\n142\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.410\n&gt;&gt; This is really like THE administrative\ntool, to be honest with you.\n\n143\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.060\nYou use it so much as a technician.\n\n144\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.920\nOn a help desk or any level,\nto be honest with you.\n\n145\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.270\nIf you're in a Windows environment,\nit is just such a handy item for\n\n146\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.480\nyou to be familiar with.\n\n147\n00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.600\nYou can't get around it.\n\n148\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.450\n&gt;&gt; I could not agree more on that one,\nbecause it just, as you're gonna see,\n\n149\n00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.955\nin fact, let's take a look and let's\nkinda follow that line of thought here.\n\n150\n00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.455\nI'll go ahead and I'll launch up,\nwell apparently storage spaces.\n\n151\n00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:41.895\nI'll launch up computer management and\n\n152\n00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:44.205\nlet's talk about some of those\nthings that Dan mentioned.\n\n153\n00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:46.357\nWe've got things like task scheduler.\n\n154\n00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:51.119\nTask scheduler, if I can say it is a great\nway to automate some of the things that go\n\n155\n00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:52.179\non your machine.\n\n156\n00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:55.669\nRather than have to get hands on,\nthey call this the least amount.\n\n157\n00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:57.841\nReducing the amount of\nadministrative effort, right.\n\n158\n00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:02.553\nThey say Which of these utilities allows\nyou to accomplish the least amount\n\n159\n00:08:02.553 --> 00:08:04.850\nof administrative effort?\n\n160\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.380\nWell that'd be Task Scheduler, right?\n\n161\n00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.800\nCuz I can create a task in here, and\n\n162\n00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.720\nI can automate it to essentially\nrun at a certain time.\n\n163\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.620\nDisk defragmentation, that's been in Task\nScheduler since Vista came out, right?\n\n164\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.434\nThey said, you know what?\n\n165\n00:08:17.434 --> 00:08:22.640\nPeople never remember to run their defrag.\n\n166\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.920\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll just schedule a task, and it'll run.\n\n167\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.290\nI don't know exactly what the task is.\n\n168\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:33.020\nIn fact, now that I mention it,\nlet's go ahead and let's find out.\n\n169\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.430\nI can't remember exactly how often it is.\n\n170\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:40.960\nThere's defrag, and if we look,\nwhat does that say here?\n\n171\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.060\nLet's see, what are the triggers?\n\n172\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.120\nIs it triggers, actions, conditions?\n\n173\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.040\nAnd I think I can double click it here.\n\n174\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.340\nYeah, there we go.\n\n175\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.147\nAnd I can see the properties of this,\nright?\n\n176\n00:08:52.147 --> 00:08:57.520\nAnd you can see, hey, that this is\ngoing to run settings here, right?\n\n177\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.215\nNotice you can make some\nmodifications here, but\n\n178\n00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:02.149\nI thought it was in here somewhere.\n\n179\n00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:05.970\nIt would tell you exactly how\noften that this would run here.\n\n180\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.939\nStart the task.\n\n181\n00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:09.030\nOkay, so here's some conditions.\n\n182\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.532\nOnly if it's on AC power,\nright, and the settings, so\n\n183\n00:09:12.532 --> 00:09:16.940\nessentially what you have is,\nthis has been here for a while, right?\n\n184\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.784\nAnd it's a task that's automated for\nyou in the background.\n\n185\n00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:24.792\nAnd it's letting me know,\nrun it when the user is logged in.\n\n186\n00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:29.205\nAgain I can't quite see how often it runs,\nbut if I remember right,\n\n187\n00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:30.689\nit runs at idle times.\n\n188\n00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:33.150\nSo it's happening in the background,\nand I don't have to worry about it.\n\n189\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.640\nGreat thing about Task Scheduler\nis the fact that,\n\n190\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.365\nhey, we can automate those tasks, we can\nkeep them running even if we forget.\n\n191\n00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:41.075\nAnd that's great,\n\n192\n00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:44.065\nbecause Wes would forget his head\nif it wasn't attached to the neck.\n\n193\n00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:47.533\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat we have inside of Task Scheduler,\n\n194\n00:09:47.533 --> 00:09:48.591\nwe have Event Viewer.\n\n195\n00:09:48.591 --> 00:09:51.995\nEvent Viewer's a great place to find\nout different things that are happening\n\n196\n00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:53.505\non your computers.\n\n197\n00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:57.445\nAnother one, if you're doing some kind of\nauditing and you need to find out, hey,\n\n198\n00:09:57.445 --> 00:10:00.766\nI had a driver that crashed,\nsome kinda problem here, I could go in and\n\n199\n00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.592\nopen up things like our Windows Logs.\n\n200\n00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:06.130\nAnd I could check out the different\nlogs that are within the system, right?\n\n201\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.395\n&gt;&gt; The great thing about this is,\ninvariably,\n\n202\n00:10:08.395 --> 00:10:12.330\nwhen you become a technician and you get\nthat phone, and it finally rings, and\n\n203\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.225\nsomeone's on the other end, they go,\nyeah, I have an error on my computer.\n\n204\n00:10:16.225 --> 00:10:18.020\nI was calling cuz I don't\nknow what it's about.\n\n205\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.800\nYou go okay, well,\nwhat does the error say?\n\n206\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.200\nI don't know.\n\n207\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.060\nWell, why not?\n\n208\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.880\nJust read it.\n\n209\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.380\nWell, I clicked OK and now it's gone.\n\n210\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.940\nWell you wanna know what the error is?\n\n211\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.020\nYou can come here, into the Event Viewer,\nand find out what the error was.\n\n212\n00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's great too, cuz then\nif they can't figure out how to go\n\n213\n00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:33.386\nto Event Viewer-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:34.787\n&gt;&gt; You can also set up things\n\n215\n00:10:34.787 --> 00:10:36.328\nlike subscriptions here.\n\n216\n00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:38.607\nThey talk about, and\nI think I just collapsed it here.\n\n217\n00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:40.249\nThey talk about subscriptions, right?\n\n218\n00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:45.603\nSubscriptions allow me to send those\nevents over to Dan's computer, right?\n\n219\n00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.910\nAnd then Dan can look at them himself,\nif he would like to.\n\n220\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.530\nOther things like Shared Folders\nshows me the shares.\n\n221\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.240\nWe'll talk about that coming\nup in another episode.\n\n222\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.840\nThe shares that are on the network,\nthe resources that we have available.\n\n223\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.370\nLocal Users and\nGroups is a great place that,\n\n224\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.960\nunlike you'll see in the control panel,\n\n225\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:09.940\nwe have kind of a basic functionality\nof what we can do to user accounts.\n\n226\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.560\nHowever, you can also modify groups here,\nwhich you can't do in\n\n227\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.640\nthe native control panel,\nuser accounts and family safety location.\n\n228\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.540\nSo great thing to have.\n\n229\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.024\nWe also have Performance monitor.\n\n230\n00:11:21.024 --> 00:11:24.664\nPerformance monitor is a great thing\nthat we'll probably see in some of our\n\n231\n00:11:24.664 --> 00:11:26.591\ntroubleshooting episodes coming up.\n\n232\n00:11:26.591 --> 00:11:28.272\n&gt;&gt; How junky is my computer [LAUGH]?\n\n233\n00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:31.786\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH] exactly,\nhow much does it weigh?\n\n234\n00:11:31.786 --> 00:11:33.354\nSo Performance monitor is great,\n\n235\n00:11:33.354 --> 00:11:35.902\nbecause you can set up things\nlike data collector sets.\n\n236\n00:11:35.902 --> 00:11:39.098\nAnd you can collect information about the\nperformance of the overall machines and\n\n237\n00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:40.123\nindividual components.\n\n238\n00:11:40.123 --> 00:11:41.930\nSo, great thing to have.\n\n239\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.270\nWe kinda mentioned this\nin another episode.\n\n240\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.040\nDan, I think it was you\nthat mentioned this.\n\n241\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.729\nWhen we did post installation, we said,\nhey, one of the things that we're\n\n242\n00:11:48.729 --> 00:11:50.884\ngonna have to do is,\nwe're gonna have to check our drivers.\n\n243\n00:11:50.884 --> 00:11:53.125\nAnd we're gonna have to find out,\n\n244\n00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:58.625\nwas Windows aware of the hardware that was\nin the system at the time of installation?\n\n245\n00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:01.655\nWell this can also give you ongoing\nmanagement of your drivers,\n\n246\n00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:05.435\nas well as the condition of the hardware\nthat's within your systems, like, for\n\n247\n00:12:05.435 --> 00:12:06.675\ninstance, my network adapters.\n\n248\n00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:09.015\nI could see Bluetooth devices, right?\n\n249\n00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:12.260\nAnd if I wanna check the properties,\nI could find out, hey, look at there,\n\n250\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.550\ndevice is working properly.\n\n251\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.323\n&gt;&gt; Lies.\n\n252\n00:12:14.323 --> 00:12:14.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right.\n\n253\n00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:16.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's wrong, wrong.\n\n254\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.711\nThen we can go to drivers right, and\nwe could see driver information.\n\n255\n00:12:19.711 --> 00:12:22.480\nI could find out where the drivers\nare located, hint, hint.\n\n256\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.947\nHint, hint, exam alert,\nexam alert, exam alert.\n\n257\n00:12:24.947 --> 00:12:31.190\nKnow that your drivers are located in\nSQL and \\Windows\\system32\\DRIVERS.\n\n258\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.724\nYes, know that for the exam.\n\n259\n00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:35.161\nBut it's also good that\nyou can see things like,\n\n260\n00:12:35.161 --> 00:12:37.570\nwhat is the version of the driver, too.\n\n261\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.018\nBecause, like anybody in gaming can\ntell you, if you have a video adapter,\n\n262\n00:12:42.018 --> 00:12:43.698\ndrivers update regularly.\n\n263\n00:12:43.698 --> 00:12:46.537\nThey update like athletes change socks.\n\n264\n00:12:46.537 --> 00:12:48.845\nSo, doesn't necessarily mean\nif you do a Windows update,\n\n265\n00:12:48.845 --> 00:12:50.610\nyou're gonna have the latest and greatest.\n\n266\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.030\nThis is a great way to kinda check that\nout and keep your system running, and\n\n267\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.650\ngiving you, really, the full utilization\nof the hardware that's within the system.\n\n268\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.830\nSo that's one of them that is in there\nthat you should always keep in mind.\n\n269\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.340\nSome of the other ones,\ndisk management, great utility.\n\n270\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.552\nThis graphical user interface that allows\nyou to manage and maintain your systems.\n\n271\n00:13:08.552 --> 00:13:12.349\nAnd we have in our accelerated track,\nwe have a Disk Management section,\n\n272\n00:13:12.349 --> 00:13:16.350\nwhere we're gonna show you\nexactly what this utility does.\n\n273\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.690\nUnder Disk Management, we have Services.\n\n274\n00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.110\nNow service is a great thing.\n\n275\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.460\nServices are processes that run in the\nbackground whether you start them or not.\n\n276\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.520\nAnd they help our\noperating system function.\n\n277\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.550\nSometimes services get a little haywire.\n\n278\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.620\nSometimes you have to make\nsure that they are turned on.\n\n279\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.997\nSometimes, you manually turn them\non as well, so this is a great way.\n\n280\n00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:36.130\nYou can get in here.\n\n281\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.340\nYou can right-click on any service.\n\n282\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.130\nYou can start it.\n\n283\n00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.920\nYou can look at the properties\nof the service.\n\n284\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.160\nYou can see,\nwhat is its current running state?\n\n285\n00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.070\nYou can say, hey, what's its startup type?\n\n286\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.210\nIs it starting automatically\nwhen I start the machine?\n\n287\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.740\nIs it doing a delayed start,\nwhich means start the machine, but\n\n288\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.060\nhold on until the boot\nprocess is finished?\n\n289\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.750\nManual says hey, I'm come in here and\nI'll start it, or\n\n290\n00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.160\nit says that not until\nanother application needs it.\n\n291\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.300\nOr disabled, like in this case,\nthis one, this one is manual, right?\n\n292\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.250\nDisabled means,\nI don't care if you need to start it,\n\n293\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.446\nI'm gonna stay asleep regardless, right?\n\n294\n00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:10.161\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n295\n00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:10.738\nthat's sometimes why you\nneed to come in here.\n\n296\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.035\nComputer management, great utility,\ngreat thing to know how to get to.\n\n297\n00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:18.858\nIt is one of your most heavily used.\n\n298\n00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.465\nAgain, Dan couldn't have said it better.\n\n299\n00:14:20.465 --> 00:14:23.925\nIt is one of your most heavily\nused administrative tools.\n\n300\n00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:24.765\nSo, let's go ahead, and\n\n301\n00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:27.070\nlet's talk about some of the other\nadministrative tools that we have.\n\n302\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.266\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nright-click on our Windows tile.\n\n303\n00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:30.685\nWe'll get into System and Security.\n\n304\n00:14:30.685 --> 00:14:31.875\nAnd, again, scrolling down.\n\n305\n00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:33.020\nRemember.\n\n306\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.980\nPractice makes perfect, right?\n\n307\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.380\nDon't practice it until you get it right,\npractice it until you can't get it wrong.\n\n308\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.540\nThen you'll know it's always right.\n\n309\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.377\nAll right, so\nsome of the other things that we have to.\n\n310\n00:14:42.377 --> 00:14:46.210\nWe have to know things like\nthe local security policy.\n\n311\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.900\nLocal security policy are security\ncentric settings, right?\n\n312\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.740\nIn the run line episode that we did,\nwe talked about things like GP update.\n\n313\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.440\nWe talked about group policy, right?\n\n314\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.670\nWell, group policy are our\nconfiguration settings, right?\n\n315\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.590\nWell, these are some of those individual\nsettings that are all focused on security,\n\n316\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.030\nput in a single location, right?\n\n317\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.213\nSo I don't care about a printer, right?\n\n318\n00:15:10.213 --> 00:15:12.330\nIn this case,\nall I'm looking for is security.\n\n319\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.898\nWell, guess what, we could come in here.\n\n320\n00:15:13.898 --> 00:15:18.730\nAnd we can do things like account password\npolicies, right, lockout thresholds and\n\n321\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.360\nstuff, all kinds of things, Windows\nFirewall with advanced settings, right?\n\n322\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.590\nWe can see what the current inbound\nrules are, outbound rules, right?\n\n323\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.810\nWe could also look at\nthe Network List Manager.\n\n324\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.790\nThis is great if you have a network\n\n325\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.400\nconnection on your adapter that's\nbeing identified as a public network.\n\n326\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.150\nIt really restricts the window's profile,\nand you're like, wait a second.\n\n327\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.865\nThere's a problem with that.\n\n328\n00:15:42.865 --> 00:15:45.416\nI know the network, and\nI don't need those restrictive settings.\n\n329\n00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:46.616\nWell, I could come in here, and\n\n330\n00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:48.715\nI could change that through\nthe local security policy.\n\n331\n00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:53.443\nAnd I could configure it manually if\nI needed to, great thing to have too.\n\n332\n00:15:53.443 --> 00:15:55.314\nSome of the other ones that they mention,\n\n333\n00:15:55.314 --> 00:15:57.460\nthis one you're not really\ngonna use too much.\n\n334\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.151\nAgain, I say that unless you're working\nin an environment where you're working\n\n335\n00:16:00.151 --> 00:16:00.776\nwith developers.\n\n336\n00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:02.584\nAnd this is Just component services.\n\n337\n00:16:02.584 --> 00:16:04.155\nWhile a lot of times,\nwe don't use this much.\n\n338\n00:16:04.155 --> 00:16:07.666\nBut you can see that it does have\nthings like event viewer in it,\n\n339\n00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.798\ndoes have services which we will use.\n\n340\n00:16:09.798 --> 00:16:14.475\nBut component services in\nof itself is right here.\n\n341\n00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:19.905\nAnd a lot of times, we don't mess\nwith things like COM+ Applications.\n\n342\n00:16:19.905 --> 00:16:23.547\nThat's dealing with things like\nCOM+ registration objects.\n\n343\n00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:26.895\nWe start talking about an objective or\nan object-oriented language.\n\n344\n00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:30.887\nNow you're getting into the dev\nenvironment, but they call it out.\n\n345\n00:16:30.887 --> 00:16:34.212\nSo, we wanna be thorough here\nwith our exam objectives.\n\n346\n00:16:34.212 --> 00:16:37.720\nIt is there, so just be aware of it.\n\n347\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.755\nOther things too.\n\n348\n00:16:38.755 --> 00:16:43.117\nOne that you might not really deal\nwith too much is data sources.\n\n349\n00:16:43.117 --> 00:16:45.517\nThey call it out on the exam.\n\n350\n00:16:45.517 --> 00:16:46.999\nJust be careful with this one,\n\n351\n00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:49.913\ncuz we certainly don't want you\nto be tripped up on the exam.\n\n352\n00:16:49.913 --> 00:16:52.646\nThey call it out as data\nsources in your objectives.\n\n353\n00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:56.560\nTechnically, it isn't called data sources.\n\n354\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.425\nIt's called ODBC Data Source and\nthat's just an acronym for\n\n355\n00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:02.177\nOpen Database Community.\n\n356\n00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:04.487\nAnd essentially,\nthis is how I would take this machine.\n\n357\n00:17:04.487 --> 00:17:09.328\nIf I need this machine, Dan's a systems\nadmin and he spun up a database and\n\n358\n00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:12.777\nhe needs this computer to\nconnect to that database.\n\n359\n00:17:12.777 --> 00:17:14.583\nThat's a program that we're\ngonna use to to do that.\n\n360\n00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:18.285\nSo again, as you go into more advanced\ntraining, don't get me wrong.\n\n361\n00:17:18.285 --> 00:17:20.505\nYou probably absolutely use this one.\n\n362\n00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.809\nHowever, at the A+ help desk level,\n\n363\n00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:26.051\nI don't know if you're really\ngonna see it too much.\n\n364\n00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:30.110\nBut it is there and\nit does give you that ability to do that.\n\n365\n00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:35.169\nOne that you might use and that you\nmight use commonly is Print Management.\n\n366\n00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:38.552\nUnderstand that built-in to the Windows\noperating system is the ability for\n\n367\n00:17:38.552 --> 00:17:40.745\nWindows to become what is\nknown as a print server.\n\n368\n00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:45.374\nA print server is basically nothing\nmore than an operative system that has\n\n369\n00:17:45.374 --> 00:17:48.062\na service in it that\ncontrols print jobs and\n\n370\n00:17:48.062 --> 00:17:52.556\nit controls those print jobs in\nthe print queues of multiple printers.\n\n371\n00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:54.709\nThat can be little boxes,\ndoesn't have to be anything crazy.\n\n372\n00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:57.848\nWindows gives you that\nfunctionality build right in and\n\n373\n00:17:57.848 --> 00:17:59.793\nthat's what we can do right here.\n\n374\n00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:01.084\nPrinter drivers.\n\n375\n00:18:01.084 --> 00:18:03.012\nWe can manage printers\nthat are on the network.\n\n376\n00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:04.221\nYou can see this is local.\n\n377\n00:18:04.221 --> 00:18:08.517\nBut if I wanted to, if I had a print\nserver like maybe a standalone box on my\n\n378\n00:18:08.517 --> 00:18:12.759\nnetwork that again, looks like nothing\nmore than a roku or an apple TV.\n\n379\n00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.253\nBut it's a print server and it's network.\n\n380\n00:18:14.253 --> 00:18:14.846\nWell, guess what?\n\n381\n00:18:14.846 --> 00:18:18.451\nI can add that to this list and\nnow I don't have sneaker net over to that\n\n382\n00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:20.765\ndevice, and\nfigure out how to work with it.\n\n383\n00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:23.879\nI could work with it in\nits centralized location.\n\n384\n00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:26.111\nIn a small environment,\nin a home environment,\n\n385\n00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:27.587\nthat might not make much sense.\n\n386\n00:18:27.587 --> 00:18:30.675\nBut when you're in an environment\nlike Dan, I know you've been in,\n\n387\n00:18:30.675 --> 00:18:33.517\nwould you wanna sneaker net to\na thousand different printers?\n\n388\n00:18:33.517 --> 00:18:34.554\n&gt;&gt; No, that'd be a whole lot of not fun.\n\n389\n00:18:34.554 --> 00:18:36.009\nAnd not only that, but\n\n390\n00:18:36.009 --> 00:18:40.615\nthis actually even in a home environment\ncould be very, very helpful.\n\n391\n00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:44.049\nI've started defaulting to this for\nall my printer maintenance.\n\n392\n00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:48.917\nBecause the Devices and Printers area\neven though it allows you to do almost\n\n393\n00:18:48.917 --> 00:18:52.635\neverything that you see here,\nit doesn't do it as well.\n\n394\n00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:53.723\nI have tried to delete printers.\n\n395\n00:18:53.723 --> 00:18:55.884\nSometimes people say,\nI've gotten rid of that printer.\n\n396\n00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:57.681\nI tried to delete it and\nit keeps coming back.\n\n397\n00:18:57.681 --> 00:18:59.675\nI come here delete, it's gone.\n\n398\n00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:01.711\nYou do it from Device and\nPrinters, you hit Delete,\n\n399\n00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:03.387\nit looks like it's gone and it comes back.\n\n400\n00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:05.240\nI've seen that kinda thing happen.\n\n401\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.150\nThis has more horsepower under the hood.\n\n402\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.300\n&gt;&gt; That's great information.\n\n403\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.830\nIt's good to know too and\nI love the consolidation part of\n\n404\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.790\nit just everything like you said,\njust right there within one location.\n\n405\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.340\nSo that's another one, Print Management\ndefinitely would know it and\n\n406\n00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.660\nI would kinda get used to that one.\n\n407\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.080\nThat's a cool one to have.\n\n408\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.070\nI think I just close,\n\n409\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.490\nI thought just closed down my\nadministrative utilities tools there.\n\n410\n00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.470\nSo, other ones that we have.\n\n411\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.750\nWe have the Windows Memory Diagnostic\nutility.\n\n412\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.890\nThis is down here at the bottom.\n\n413\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.340\nIt does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n414\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.460\nIf you were to run this, it allows you\nto restart the machine and check RAM.\n\n415\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.220\nRight now,\nwe have an operating system in RAM.\n\n416\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.590\nSo, it's kind of hard to check\nthe hardware that the operating system\n\n417\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.210\nis using it.\n\n418\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.245\nSo we could restart it now or we could do\ncheck from problems next time I restart\n\n419\n00:19:48.245 --> 00:19:52.065\nmy computer and this will schedule a task,\nand the next time the boot loader runs.\n\n420\n00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:56.905\nThe window@boot.bootmgr.exe,\nit'll see that little flag that's saying,\n\n421\n00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.205\nhey, you need to run\nthe Windows Memory Diagnostic.\n\n422\n00:19:59.205 --> 00:20:02.680\nYou don't need to load the kernel and\nit'll run this utility inside a RAM.\n\n423\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.490\nSo great thing to have too, as well.\n\n424\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.390\nWindows Firewall,\n\n425\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.940\nthere's a couple different additions\nto the Windows Firewall that you have.\n\n426\n00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.760\nWe've talked about in past episodes,\nwe've talked about the Windows Firewall.\n\n427\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.278\nYou can get to that via\nyour Control Panel.\n\n428\n00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:22.440\nI'm just gonna take a second here and\nkinda deviate from the beaten path here,\n\n429\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.350\nDan and just show you have what's\nknown as the basic firewall and\n\n430\n00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:30.350\nthe basic firewall allows me\njust basically select different\n\n431\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:35.020\nindividual applications a nd I can allow\nthem communication through the firewall.\n\n432\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.380\nUnderstand for your exam.\n\n433\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.900\nIf you're not aware,\n\n434\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.090\nbasic firewall functionality before you\nconfigure it a lot of times is to block\n\n435\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.640\nevery communication over the network\ncoming into your computer.\n\n436\n00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.900\nBut allow everything\noutbound of your computer.\n\n437\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.600\nNow if you have just the basic\nnecessity to maybe open\n\n438\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.560\nup aprogram that's inside of Windows and\nyou wanna allow it to communicate\n\n439\n00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.210\nover the network back to you like some\nof the ones that you see in this list or\n\n440\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.000\nmore specifically maybe something\nlike Remote Desktop, well,\n\n441\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.010\nyou have to allow it through the firewall.\n\n442\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.350\nSo you just come in here put a check\nmark there and you could choose OK,\n\n443\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.810\nand that makes an exception to that\nrule of everything being blocked\n\n444\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.570\ncoming into your computer.\n\n445\n00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.550\nNow if you need more functionality,\n\n446\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.020\nyou can also launch the windows firewall\nwith advanced settings right here.\n\n447\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.550\nLittle task jump link, but\n\n448\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.520\nyou can also see it inside of the\nadministrative tools here in this list.\n\n449\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.690\nAnd in this list, now we kind of\nlike you've opened Pandora's box.\n\n450\n00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:37.870\nThis allows you a lot more flexibility,\na lot more fine tuned granular control.\n\n451\n00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.031\nBecause now not only can we\ncontrol inbound communications,\n\n452\n00:21:41.031 --> 00:21:43.473\nwe can also control\noutbound communications.\n\n453\n00:21:43.473 --> 00:21:48.024\nAnd even more specifically,\nI can tailor make these rules here to\n\n454\n00:21:48.024 --> 00:21:52.342\na lot of different criteria not\njust by programming any more.\n\n455\n00:21:52.342 --> 00:21:57.083\nNow we are talking about TCP/IP base port,\npredefined services which would be a kin\n\n456\n00:21:57.083 --> 00:22:01.250\nin what we've seen in the basic firewall\nor I can even go customize right.\n\n457\n00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:06.040\nWe can really live dangerously here and\nI can do like custom services.\n\n458\n00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.580\nReally, really good specific here.\n\n459\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.985\nSo allows you a lot of flexibility going,\neven farther than that.\n\n460\n00:22:10.985 --> 00:22:15.205\nYou can do something like modify, things\nlike Connection Security Rules which you\n\n461\n00:22:15.205 --> 00:22:18.905\ndon't have to worry for\nthis exam is really just IP sec centric.\n\n462\n00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:25.270\nA global suite of security implementations\nto protect you information.\n\n463\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.840\nYou also have the monitoring ability that\nallows you to monitor everything that's\n\n464\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.080\ncurrently active on your\nmachine including those rules.\n\n465\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.370\nAnd again, things like security\nassociations which is related to IP sec\n\n466\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.530\nwhich I think is far beyond what you're\ngonna need to know for the A+ exam.\n\n467\n00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.350\nBut it is good to just generally\nkind of have that information.\n\n468\n00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.870\nAll right, Dan, what else do we got?\n\n469\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.370\nLooks like we've taken care of\nsome of the other ones here,\n\n470\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.270\nbecause they're kind of\nall wrapped together.\n\n471\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.280\nSome of them were actually\nin computer management.\n\n472\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.510\nNotice that while we did see computer\nmanagement, remember what Dan said,\n\n473\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.990\nhey, that computer management,\nit's got what you need in one location.\n\n474\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.360\nLet me show you a little bit more\nabout what he's talking about.\n\n475\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.160\nRemember we were looking at services.\n\n476\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.720\nServices has its own console.\n\n477\n00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.700\nPerformance monitor has its own console.\n\n478\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.310\nI don't need computer management for\nthat task scheduler has its own console,\n\n479\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.890\nbut wouldn't it be nice to just fire up\nassembly utility and I don't have to go\n\n480\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.880\njiminy clickets and click this and\nclick that to get to the same location.\n\n481\n00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.510\nWe can do it all in that under one hood.\n\n482\n00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.250\nUnder one umbrella, if you will.\n\n483\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.634\nSo, a great thing to have.\n\n484\n00:23:27.634 --> 00:23:32.054\nNow speaking of system management, there's\nanother one in this list that we need\n\n485\n00:23:32.054 --> 00:23:35.640\nto be aware of and\nthat's called System Configuration.\n\n486\n00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.155\nIf I launch up System Configuration,\nwell, guess what?\n\n487\n00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:43.125\nI have the ability to modify\nhow the computer starts up.\n\n488\n00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:47.331\nWe can do diagnostic startups like in safe\nmode which only loads the basic device\n\n489\n00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:49.293\ndrivers, if you will and services.\n\n490\n00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:53.286\nIt says, if it's not essential to\nstarting the operating system,\n\n491\n00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:55.466\nkeep it out of the boot-up process.\n\n492\n00:23:55.466 --> 00:24:00.012\nThis is good for troubleshooting\nproblematic third-party drivers.\n\n493\n00:24:00.012 --> 00:24:02.859\nAnd we could find out if\nwe have a multiboot system.\n\n494\n00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:04.929\nWe have more than one\nWindows Operating System.\n\n495\n00:24:04.929 --> 00:24:07.390\nWe could select which one is the default.\n\n496\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.720\nAnd when you're presented with like\na multi-operating system selection screen,\n\n497\n00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.460\nhow long does it time out\nbefore it makes the choice?\n\n498\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.300\nAnd this would tell you what\nthe default choice would be,\n\n499\n00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.630\nas well as things like your boot options.\n\n500\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.077\nI can do safe boot.\n\n501\n00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:24.190\nBoot you into a Safe Mode.\n\n502\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.570\nAlternate shell would give you\nthe Safe Mode with Command Prompt.\n\n503\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.108\nActive Directory repair or booting into\nSafe Mode, if you will with the network.\n\n504\n00:24:32.108 --> 00:24:34.934\nUnderstand that there's a little\nbit of play on verbiage there, but\n\n505\n00:24:34.934 --> 00:24:37.990\nit's essentially Safe Mode,\neither just Safe Mode by itself.\n\n506\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.383\nNo network connections.\n\n507\n00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:43.772\nSafe Mode with just your Command Prompt,\n\n508\n00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:47.051\nwhich is all you'll get just\nthe text based interface and\n\n509\n00:24:47.051 --> 00:24:51.030\nif you want safe mode with actually\ninitiating the network adaptor.\n\n510\n00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.448\nSo, couple of different ways.\n\n511\n00:24:52.448 --> 00:24:55.253\nBasically, you could modify\nhow Windows starts up,\n\n512\n00:24:55.253 --> 00:24:59.068\nincluding seeing things like services and\nwhat their current state is.\n\n513\n00:24:59.068 --> 00:25:02.623\nRemember, the columns are clickable and\nyou could sort them by running or\n\n514\n00:25:02.623 --> 00:25:05.580\nin this case,\nI can sort them by what stopped.\n\n515\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.263\nStartup has changed.\n\n516\n00:25:07.263 --> 00:25:10.986\nExam alert, exam alert, exam alert.\n\n517\n00:25:10.986 --> 00:25:15.659\nStartup tab is still there and so\nmany people are used to seeing it,\n\n518\n00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:17.751\nbecause it's in Windows 7.\n\n519\n00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:21.630\nAnd prior to that, what you could do\nis you could come in here and you\n\n520\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:26.483\ncould modify if applications put their,\nthe application starts up at boot time and\n\n521\n00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:29.842\nit's causing a high impact on\nhow long it takes to start.\n\n522\n00:25:29.842 --> 00:25:31.580\nYou can come in here and disable them.\n\n523\n00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.419\nToday, what you have to do in Windows 8,\nexam alert,\n\n524\n00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:38.093\nexam alert is inside of Task Manager.\n\n525\n00:25:38.093 --> 00:25:39.801\nSo, I just right-click on the taskbar.\n\n526\n00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:41.700\nI choose Task Manager.\n\n527\n00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.420\nIt doesn't really show you much here,\nso you choose more details.\n\n528\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.766\nYou go to the startup tab and\nthere you go.\n\n529\n00:25:47.766 --> 00:25:48.837\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n530\n00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:53.350\nWhat we would have originally have\nseen inside of System Configuration.\n\n531\n00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.147\nNow, let me go ahead.\n\n532\n00:25:54.147 --> 00:25:58.272\nWhat I'll do is I'm gonna bump over to\nmy Windows 7 machine here real quick,\n\n533\n00:25:58.272 --> 00:26:02.079\nbecause what I'd like to do is show\nyou another way that you could launch\n\n534\n00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:06.414\nSystem Configuration Utility and I can\nalso show you the old startup tab as well.\n\n535\n00:26:06.414 --> 00:26:11.454\nSo if I choose the start button and\nI go to start and I just go ahead and\n\n536\n00:26:11.454 --> 00:26:15.470\ntype msconfig,\nnotice that I get this little icon.\n\n537\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:20.012\nIt's another run line command,\nmsconfig and notice what it launches up.\n\n538\n00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:22.442\nIt also launches up\nSystem Configuration Utility.\n\n539\n00:26:22.442 --> 00:26:23.970\nSo, don't let that confuse you.\n\n540\n00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:28.416\nSystem Configuration and msconfig,\nthey're one in the same.\n\n541\n00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:33.670\nAnd notice the Startup tab here,\nit's identical.\n\n542\n00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.650\nIt's no different.\n\n543\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.286\nIt's the exact same thing.\n\n544\n00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:38.969\nSo, that's a little bit about.\n\n545\n00:26:38.969 --> 00:26:40.908\nI told you a little bit\nabout Task Manager and\n\n546\n00:26:40.908 --> 00:26:42.698\nthey kinda look a little bit different.\n\n547\n00:26:42.698 --> 00:26:46.500\nRemember, Task Manager,\nyou can always right-click on the taskbar.\n\n548\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.673\nChoose Task Manager.\n\n549\n00:26:47.673 --> 00:26:50.077\nAnd again, it is a little bit different.\n\n550\n00:26:50.077 --> 00:26:55.666\nYeah, performance and networking are two\ndifferent tabs inside of Windows 7 and\n\n551\n00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:57.290\nWindows 8 and 8.1.\n\n552\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.615\nPerformance shows you CPU utilization,\n\n553\n00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:05.390\nmemory utilization, networking and\neven your disk I/O.\n\n554\n00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:10.510\nSo, they've given it a really good upgrade\nas they move into newer operating systems.\n\n555\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.209\nWe could see the applications\nthat are running.\n\n556\n00:27:12.209 --> 00:27:15.199\nAnd if I want, if I have\na problematic app that is hanging,\n\n557\n00:27:15.199 --> 00:27:16.550\nI can always end the task.\n\n558\n00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.133\nKinda like task kill like we've shown\nyou in another episode that you could\n\n559\n00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:20.490\ndo through the Command Prompt.\n\n560\n00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.812\nHere's your graphical\nuser interface button,\n\n561\n00:27:22.812 --> 00:27:25.710\nif you maybe are a little\nintimidated by the Command Prompt.\n\n562\n00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.960\nSo we can see services, as well here.\n\n563\n00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.791\nWe can also see some of the networking.\n\n564\n00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:31.507\nHow much bandwidth we're utilizing,\n\n565\n00:27:31.507 --> 00:27:34.980\nas well as the users that\nare currently logged into the machine.\n\n566\n00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.469\nI cannot reiterate enough that if you're\ntalking about Task Manager inside Windows\n\n567\n00:27:39.469 --> 00:27:41.815\n8, oops, we're not going to Skype here.\n\n568\n00:27:41.815 --> 00:27:46.832\nSorry, my Mac is getting in the way and\nwe choose Task Manager.\n\n569\n00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:51.510\nRemember, startup utility is where we do\nthat, no longer System Configuration.\n\n570\n00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.005\nNotice that you also have the performance\ntab and look at everything.\n\n571\n00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:56.774\nIt's all in here in one location,\nCPU, Memory.\n\n572\n00:27:56.774 --> 00:28:00.632\nI call them the four horsemen, cuz these\ncan be the four problematic things for\n\n573\n00:28:00.632 --> 00:28:02.105\nyour computing experience.\n\n574\n00:28:02.105 --> 00:28:06.279\nCPU, memory, your disk I/O or\ndisk in general and your networking,\n\n575\n00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:08.370\nall in a single location.\n\n576\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.454\nOne thing it also added, app history.\n\n577\n00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:12.728\nThese are for your modern UI apps.\n\n578\n00:28:12.728 --> 00:28:15.783\nThat isn't in the earlier Task Manager.\n\n579\n00:28:15.783 --> 00:28:20.067\nIf I wanna see things like your\nconsumption of your modern UI apps,\n\n580\n00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:23.969\nthose tile apps that you see\nbasically on your start screen,\n\n581\n00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:27.770\nI can see all of that right\nthere in that location.\n\n582\n00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.660\nSo, a couple good things to have.\n\n583\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.290\nOne of the last things I just wanna kinda\nmention is some of the things that we see\n\n584\n00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.398\nin Control Panel here.\n\n585\n00:28:34.398 --> 00:28:36.120\nThere are a slew of these.\n\n586\n00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.465\nI encourage you guys to look\nthrough each one of these and\n\n587\n00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:44.179\nkinda figure out what they do, if you\nwant a more full explanation of each one.\n\n588\n00:28:44.179 --> 00:28:49.355\nRemember, we do have our\ncomplete 900 series.\n\n589\n00:28:49.355 --> 00:28:51.763\nBut we have things like\ninternet options and\n\n590\n00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:54.051\ninternet options is a good thing to have.\n\n591\n00:28:54.051 --> 00:28:57.247\nAnd remember that inside a Control Panel,\n\n592\n00:28:57.247 --> 00:29:02.318\nyou can do things like switch from\nthe category view to large icons.\n\n593\n00:29:02.318 --> 00:29:03.840\nThey use to call this classic view.\n\n594\n00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.054\nBut now since Windows 7 and beyond,\nthey don't call it a classic view anymore.\n\n595\n00:29:08.054 --> 00:29:09.540\nThey call it large or small icons.\n\n596\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:14.372\nIf you're in Vista, you would see a little\ntask link on the left-hand side of your\n\n597\n00:29:14.372 --> 00:29:17.453\nControl Panel that have\na little jump link like these\n\n598\n00:29:17.453 --> 00:29:21.325\nhyperlinks that we're clicking\nthat would say, classic view.\n\n599\n00:29:21.325 --> 00:29:23.535\nAfter Vista, they no longer have that.\n\n600\n00:29:23.535 --> 00:29:28.344\nBut if I go into, for instance,\nI can go into internet options and\n\n601\n00:29:28.344 --> 00:29:32.112\nI can modify the properties\nof Internet Explorer.\n\n602\n00:29:32.112 --> 00:29:35.591\nThis is a great thing, if you get\nInternet Explorer's kinda hosed up and\n\n603\n00:29:35.591 --> 00:29:37.997\nwon't launch or\nit's taking forever to launch.\n\n604\n00:29:37.997 --> 00:29:38.703\nYou can close it down.\n\n605\n00:29:38.703 --> 00:29:42.650\nYou can always come in here and\nyou can go through the different tabs.\n\n606\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.721\nWorst case scenario,\nyou can go to advanced.\n\n607\n00:29:44.721 --> 00:29:47.990\nYou can actually reset the entire browser.\n\n608\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.531\nSo, you got a few different tabs in here.\n\n609\n00:29:49.531 --> 00:29:50.480\nI would be aware of it.\n\n610\n00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.790\nSecurity zones, these are how you classify\nand how Internet Explorer will interact\n\n611\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:59.038\nwith different URLs that you visit whether\nthey're gonna be allowed to run certain\n\n612\n00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:01.906\nextensions or\nwhether they're gonna be restrictive.\n\n613\n00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:03.990\nSo, know these security zones.\n\n614\n00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.278\nPrivacy is how we handle things\nlike third-party cookies.\n\n615\n00:30:07.278 --> 00:30:09.535\nContent is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n616\n00:30:09.535 --> 00:30:12.623\nThis is things like feeds,\nweb certificates, if you will.\n\n617\n00:30:12.623 --> 00:30:17.190\nConnections are where you can setup things\nlike VPN communications, as well and\n\n618\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.005\nadd proxies.\n\n619\n00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:22.230\nPrograms are how programs are gonna\ninteract with Internet Explorer.\n\n620\n00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.916\nSo, great thing to have there.\n\n621\n00:30:24.916 --> 00:30:25.805\nOther things that we have.\n\n622\n00:30:25.805 --> 00:30:29.469\nWe also, for instance,\nwe have user accounts.\n\n623\n00:30:29.469 --> 00:30:33.896\nKeep in mind that inside of user\naccounts down here at the bottom,\n\n624\n00:30:33.896 --> 00:30:38.305\nthis is where you can just manage and\nmodify your user accounts.\n\n625\n00:30:38.305 --> 00:30:43.108\nOne limitation is you cannot make groups,\nthat's where we go to Command Prompt or\n\n626\n00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:46.461\nadministrative tools and\nwe go to local users in groups.\n\n627\n00:30:46.461 --> 00:30:48.578\nOther things that we have photo options.\n\n628\n00:30:48.578 --> 00:30:51.135\nPhoto options is great and\nI would know how to get to it.\n\n629\n00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:52.280\nWe go to photo options.\n\n630\n00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.150\nKeep in mind this is how\nWindows Explorer and\n\n631\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.030\nFile Explorer will show different things.\n\n632\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.234\nHow are you gonna view those things\ninside of the major file and\n\n633\n00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:04.137\nfolder management graphical\nuser interface utility?\n\n634\n00:31:04.137 --> 00:31:05.530\nFor instance, I go to the view tab.\n\n635\n00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.392\nYou can see things like hidden files and\nfolders.\n\n636\n00:31:07.392 --> 00:31:09.410\nWe don't share those.\n\n637\n00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.183\nWindows doesn't want you\nreally to see those.\n\n638\n00:31:11.183 --> 00:31:14.365\nThe average end user doesn't\nreally deal with them\n\n639\n00:31:14.365 --> 00:31:18.363\nincluding things like hiding\nextensions for known file types.\n\n640\n00:31:18.363 --> 00:31:20.130\nSo great things to have, again,\n\n641\n00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.674\nall different kinds of things that\nI would be aware of for the exam.\n\n642\n00:31:23.674 --> 00:31:28.340\nSome of the other ones that we have\ninside of here that you really don't see.\n\n643\n00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.593\nYou have to go to the category view.\n\n644\n00:31:30.593 --> 00:31:34.080\nThey talk about programs and\nyou have programs and features.\n\n645\n00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.574\nPrograms and features allows you to see\nthe programs that are installed inside of\n\n646\n00:31:38.574 --> 00:31:39.896\nthe operating system,\n\n647\n00:31:39.896 --> 00:31:44.472\nas well as seeing things like the updates\nthat have been installed in the machine.\n\n648\n00:31:44.472 --> 00:31:45.575\nGreat little thing to have.\n\n649\n00:31:45.575 --> 00:31:47.913\nDan mentioned this other one earlier.\n\n650\n00:31:47.913 --> 00:31:51.797\nHe mentioned device and\nprinters unlike printer management,\n\n651\n00:31:51.797 --> 00:31:54.369\nso in Control Panel under category view.\n\n652\n00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:59.160\nIf I decide that I want to see Devices and\nPrinters I go to hardware and sound.\n\n653\n00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.102\nAnd yes, up there at the top is Device and\nPrinters and these are all the devices\n\n654\n00:32:03.102 --> 00:32:06.507\nthat are connected to the machine as\nwell as the printers and we can do\n\n655\n00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:11.039\nmanagement here like, for instance, adding\ndevices and adding printers right there.\n\n656\n00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:13.360\nSo, a great way to manage your printers.\n\n657\n00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.236\nWe also have power options and\nthat's under Hardware and Sound,\n\n658\n00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:18.717\nkinda go from the beginning there.\n\n659\n00:32:18.717 --> 00:32:21.860\nRemember Control Panel,\nHardware and Sound, power options.\n\n660\n00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.928\nThis is where I can control and\n\n661\n00:32:23.928 --> 00:32:27.835\ndefine the power plans that\nare available for systems.\n\n662\n00:32:27.835 --> 00:32:31.688\nBalanced means, hey,\nbalance performance with power saving.\n\n663\n00:32:31.688 --> 00:32:34.700\nThe power saver says,\nI don't care if you need the performance.\n\n664\n00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.233\nYou're not gonna get it and\n\n665\n00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:40.098\nit's gonna just favor on the side of\nsaving all the power you can, and\n\n666\n00:32:40.098 --> 00:32:44.116\nwe also have high performance too,\nand that says just run it wide open.\n\n667\n00:32:44.116 --> 00:32:45.200\nLast two there, Dan.\n\n668\n00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.464\nI know we're kinda running to\nthe end of this one is sound.\n\n669\n00:32:48.464 --> 00:32:52.624\nThis is where modify things like your\nsound settings and I would get in here and\n\n670\n00:32:52.624 --> 00:32:56.784\nknow some of the things that you can do\nsetting the default audio device as well\n\n671\n00:32:56.784 --> 00:33:00.752\nas one that we're gonna talk pretty\nextensively about is in Network, and\n\n672\n00:33:00.752 --> 00:33:03.716\nInternet and that's the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n673\n00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:07.579\nAnd that's where you view, manage,\nmodify different network connections and\n\n674\n00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:10.950\nwe will be looking at that when we\nget into Windows client networking.\n\n675\n00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.330\nBut remember, we just wanted you to\nbe aware of the Control Panel and\n\n676\n00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.533\nhow you get to some of the various\nutilities that you will face and\n\n677\n00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:20.047\nencounter inside of your\nWindows environments.\n\n678\n00:33:20.047 --> 00:33:22.691\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, it would seem that\nthe Control Panel is aptly named.\n\n679\n00:33:22.691 --> 00:33:26.130\nGives us a lot of control to do\nmaintenance and upgrades, you name it.\n\n680\n00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.354\nIt's all right there inside\nof the Control Panel.\n\n681\n00:33:28.354 --> 00:33:31.280\nIt spend a lot of your time as\na tech inside of that thing.\n\n682\n00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.775\nSo, get familiar with whatever version or\nall versions that you can.\n\n683\n00:33:35.775 --> 00:33:37.665\nWes, thanks so much for\nwalking us through that.\n\n684\n00:33:37.665 --> 00:33:39.260\nWe appreciate your time on that.\n\n685\n00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.626\nWe do appreciate our good\naudience out there for watching.\n\n686\n00:33:41.626 --> 00:33:45.110\nBut as Wes has eluded to,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n687\n00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.750\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n688\n00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.130\nI've been your hots, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n689\n00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.142\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n690\n00:33:49.142 --> 00:33:50.386\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n691\n00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:57.406\n[MUSIC]\n\n692\n00:33:57.406 --> 00:34:00.532\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.317\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:12.241\n&gt;&gt; You're watching, ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.071\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.644\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.067\nwe are back with more in our\nA plus accelerated track.\n\n9\n00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:25.680\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.088\nWes, glad to have you, how is it going?\n\n11\n00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:29.283\n&gt;&gt; Man, its going great,\nI'm just excited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:32.888\nAnd we hope that everybody out there\nin computer land, or TV land, or\n\n13\n00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:35.970\nwhatever avenue it is,\nthat you are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n14\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.494\nWe hope your having a great time too.\n\n15\n00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:40.459\nKeep in mind,\nas we move through the accelerated course,\n\n16\n00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:43.130\nDan has already mentioned\nit in past episodes here.\n\n17\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.180\nThat it is gonna be a little\nbit of assumed knowledge,\n\n18\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.560\nas we move through some of these concepts.\n\n19\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.613\nNow keep in mind, that in the ITPRO.TV\nlibrary, we have an entire\n\n20\n00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:58.860\nseparated set of 901 objectives,\nas well as 902 objectives.\n\n21\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.670\nSo, if you need a little bit more\nin depth, keep those in mind here.\n\n22\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.580\nSo we're gonna dive into\nWindows client networking, and\n\n23\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.470\nsome of the things that you\nmight face on the exam,\n\n24\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.750\nwhen it comes to just general\nnetworking inside of Windows.\n\n25\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.410\nNow, keep in mind that when we talk\nabout networking inside of Windows,\n\n26\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.910\nthere are some commonalities.\n\n27\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.740\nAnd it doesn't matter if you're\ntalking about Windows, Linux.\n\n28\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.750\nIf you're talking about Unix Operating\nSystems, Mac Operating Systems, right.\n\n29\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.922\nWe are talking about things like having to\nestablish a network connection with LAN\n\n30\n00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:29.080\nbased technologies.\n\n31\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.846\nWe're talking about having to\nset things like IP addresses,\n\n32\n00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:36.422\nand the 901 type of jack divs.\n\n33\n00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:40.923\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nthat in basically, in other episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:40.923 --> 00:01:44.349\nHowever here, when we talk about it,\neven though we're mentioning\n\n35\n00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:48.000\nthings that are some technologies\nthat are specific to WIndows.\n\n36\n00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.456\nKeep in mind that it doesn't matter\nwhat Operating System you have,\n\n37\n00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:54.196\nif you need to connect and\ncommunicate with a network,\n\n38\n00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.536\nyou have to have things\nlike Ethernet cables.\n\n39\n00:01:56.536 --> 00:02:00.109\nYou have to have network adapters,\nnetwork adapters have Mac addresses,\n\n40\n00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.594\nyou have to have IP addresses.\n\n41\n00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:03.840\nAnd that isn't anything unique to Windows.\n\n42\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.100\nSo we are gonna talk about some of the\nthings that is more of a specific setup,\n\n43\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.560\nand how you get to communicate\nwith a network, and\n\n44\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.630\nother computers inside of\nthe Windows environment.\n\n45\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.210\nSo let's go ahead,\n\n46\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.510\nand we're gonna start off with three\ntopics, three different topics, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.570\nThey have what is known as a work group,\nand we have what's known as a domain.\n\n48\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.560\nAnd they also call out something\nknown as a home group, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.830\nNow, when we talk about a work group,\nwhat is a work group?\n\n50\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.280\nWell, a work group is Microsoft's\nimplementation of what's known as\n\n51\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.490\na peer-to-peer network, right?\n\n52\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.790\nThe peer-to-peer network's more\nof an industry wide term, right?\n\n53\n00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.024\nThat is the vendor neutral term, and\nit means that you have client operating\n\n54\n00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:44.808\nsystems that could be requesting\nresources from other computers.\n\n55\n00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:48.280\nBut at the same time, they might be\nproviding some of those resources, right?\n\n56\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.110\nFor instance, if I've got a Windows\nclient operating system, and\n\n57\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.100\nit's out there on the network, and\nit doesn't have a computer attached to it.\n\n58\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.140\nIt might call out over the network,\nand it might say, hey,\n\n59\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.270\nis there any computer out\nthere that's running?\n\n60\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.340\nThat administrative utility\ncalled print management, right?\n\n61\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.826\nAnd that other Windows client that's out\nthere, maybe has a printer attached to it.\n\n62\n00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:09.950\nAnd it's running the print management, and\nit's actually acting like a print server.\n\n63\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.230\nSo now, we got a client operating system\nthat is also providing resources for\n\n64\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.570\nother computers.\n\n65\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.359\nSo even though it's a client, some clients\nact like clients requesting resources, and\n\n66\n00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.550\nsome clients act like servers, right, and\nthat's why they call them peers, right?\n\n67\n00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.710\nThere's more of this equality, if you\nwill, because sometimes we're requesting\n\n68\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.660\nresources like client's do, but\nsometimes, we're providing resources.\n\n69\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.621\nNow that's essentially\nwhat the work group is.\n\n70\n00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:33.423\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, when it comes to a work group,\n\n71\n00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:37.304\nyou're really starting to hint around what\nthe, I don't wanna say fatal flaw, but\n\n72\n00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:40.438\nthe limitations, shall I say,\nof using a work group environment.\n\n73\n00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.498\nAnd that is, well,\nit doesn't scale very well, and\n\n74\n00:03:43.498 --> 00:03:46.880\nit sounds like management\ncould be a bit of an issue.\n\n75\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.230\n&gt;&gt; Exam alert.\n\n76\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.410\nExam alert.\n\n77\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.310\nAnd, if I didn't say it, exam alert.\n\n78\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\nthis is all gonna be on the exam?\n\n79\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.330\n&gt;&gt; Hey, this might be on the exam.\n\n80\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.745\nAnd what I mean by that,\nis the limitation is ten.\n\n81\n00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:59.639\nTen is the maximum amount, not users.\n\n82\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.370\nDon't let that throw you off, right?\n\n83\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.810\nI can put as many users as I\nwant on a single computer, and\n\n84\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.100\nI can have up to ten computers.\n\n85\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.190\nSo, theoretically,\nI could put ten users per computer, and\n\n86\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.550\nI could have a hundred different\nusers on one of these networks.\n\n87\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.030\nBut, when it comes to\nthe computers within a work group,\n\n88\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.580\nthe maximum limitation is ten.\n\n89\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.930\nNow, why would Microsoft wanna\nset some crazy limitation?\n\n90\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.719\nIs that because they don't wanna\nsell you more Operating Systems?\n\n91\n00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.320\n&gt;&gt; That's probably not gonna be the case,\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.130\n[LAUGH] They wanna sell you as many\nOperating Systems as possible, right?\n\n94\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n&gt;&gt; Bill Gates said at one time,\n\n95\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.030\nthe vision for the future was\na PC in every living room, right?\n\n96\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.630\nSo why did they set this limitation?\n\n97\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.870\nWell, that comes to the next comment\nthat Dan made about management.\n\n98\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.607\nIt is a completely decentralized\nnetworking environment, right?\n\n99\n00:04:47.607 --> 00:04:52.167\nA work group is typically one where\nevery computer you have to manage\n\n100\n00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.800\nthe users individually.\n\n101\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.620\nNow what this means is that,\nif I have a single computer, and\n\n102\n00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.550\nlet's call that, a single a computer,\nand I have an account on it.\n\n103\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.046\nLet's say it's admin or\nstudent 01, all right.\n\n104\n00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:08.679\nBut what I wanna do is I wanna\nhave ten computers within that\n\n105\n00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:09.930\npeer-to-peer network.\n\n106\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.790\nAnd what I wanna do is I\nwanna have student 01 have\n\n107\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.030\nan account on every single\none of those ten computers.\n\n108\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.540\nWell, guess what?\n\n109\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.500\nI don't get to do that from one computer,\nconfigure that account.\n\n110\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.280\nAnd then, that student 01 account\ncan log into every other computer.\n\n111\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.160\nI gotta do Sneakernet.\n\n112\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.680\nI gotta go to the computer 1,\nright, let's say client 01.\n\n113\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.200\nI gotta go to the first computer, and\nI gotta configure student 01's account.\n\n114\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.035\nBut then,\nI gotta go to the second computer.\n\n115\n00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:38.390\nAnd I have to configure the account,\nand the third, and the fourth, and\n\n116\n00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.817\nthe fifth, and\nyou get it all the way up to the tenth.\n\n117\n00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:45.604\nSo that's ten different computers\nI physically have to sit at,\n\n118\n00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:48.363\nin order to manage that one account.\n\n119\n00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:51.067\nNow, we talk about two accounts,\nwe talk about three accounts,\n\n120\n00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:53.933\nnow we're talking about 30\ndifferent accounts you've created.\n\n121\n00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:59.130\nImagine ten, ten accounts you have created\nessentially what ten times ten, a hundred?\n\n122\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what you got by your\n\n123\n00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.205\n[INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; That's my calculation.\n\n124\n00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:03.248\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH].\n\n125\n00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:04.390\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n126\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.200\nThat's a hundred different accounts you\nhad to do for configuration, right.\n\n127\n00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.000\nSo it starts to become\nan administrative nightmare.\n\n128\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.490\nAnd that’s where we move into\nMicrosoft's domain environment, right.\n\n129\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.630\nWhen we talk about a Windows domain,\ntypically,\n\n130\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.370\nwhat we're talking about is a single\ncomputer that’s controlling\n\n131\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.280\nthe whole name, or\nthe whole network, excuse me.\n\n132\n00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.800\nAnd it’s interesting,\nif you think about it, a Windows domain.\n\n133\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.350\nAnd, if it is controlling the entire\nnetwork, that one computer is a server,\n\n134\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.540\nand it is typically running\nsomething known as Active Directory.\n\n135\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.550\nAnd more importantly,\nthat is called a domain controller.\n\n136\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.290\nNow, let's imagine the same ten accounts.\n\n137\n00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.270\nWith those same ten accounts,\nwhat I'm gonna actually do is,\n\n138\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.850\nI'm gonna go to just that one computer,\nthat server, and\n\n139\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.820\nI'm gonna configure that\nuser account one time.\n\n140\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.060\nStudent 01, and I'm gonna configure\nthe username, not just the username, but\n\n141\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.650\nI'm gonna configure the password as well,\nand guess what?\n\n142\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.742\nI can go to student 01 and I could say,\nhere you go, here's your password.\n\n143\n00:06:58.742 --> 00:07:01.180\nAnd then, I can take those ten computers,\n\n144\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.249\nand do something known as\njoining them to the domain.\n\n145\n00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:09.023\nWhich it now happens to be that that\ndomain controller is gonna take control\n\n146\n00:07:09.023 --> 00:07:12.000\nessentially, of the configurations.\n\n147\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.540\nEvery one of those ten computers are gonna\nform what's known as a trust relationship.\n\n148\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.540\nAnd when I give student 01 their log\nin credentials, they can log in to\n\n149\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.170\nany one of those machines, and I only had\nto go to just one computer, all right?\n\n150\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.460\nThis is what we call a client\nserver model, right?\n\n151\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.248\nUnlike the peer to peer model,\nwhich is a decentralized model.\n\n152\n00:07:30.248 --> 00:07:33.833\nThe opposite of that, if you will,\nis going to be a client server model.\n\n153\n00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:37.889\nAnd a client server model is what\nwe call centralized administration.\n\n154\n00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:39.940\nAnd when you have\ncentralized administration,\n\n155\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.591\nyou reduce the administrative complexities\nto manage and maintain that network, and\n\n156\n00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:44.840\nwe can go farther than that.\n\n157\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.390\nBecause what we can do on that same\ndomain control of that single server,\n\n158\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.210\nbecause we can configure policies.\n\n159\n00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.287\nWe configure policies that are called\nbrute policies, and imagine this,\n\n160\n00:07:55.287 --> 00:07:57.692\nthey abide to a group of users or\ncomputers.\n\n161\n00:07:57.692 --> 00:08:00.572\nAnd I can configure a policy,\nand I can push it out, and\n\n162\n00:08:00.572 --> 00:08:04.457\neveryone of those ten computers that\nwe just joined to the domain But now,\n\n163\n00:08:04.457 --> 00:08:08.657\nhave that trust relationship say sure,\nlet me talk to you domain controller and\n\n164\n00:08:08.657 --> 00:08:11.727\nI pulled down the settings and\nif you tell me this is the way I\n\n165\n00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:15.390\ngotta configure myself\nthat's the way I'll do it.\n\n166\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.970\nOne computer, one configuration effects\na multitude of computers and users,\n\n167\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.660\nwhile a single user really.\n\n168\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.651\n&gt;&gt; It's a true dictatorship.\n\n169\n00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:25.683\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is,\nthis is a monarchy for sure.\n\n170\n00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:27.661\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n171\n00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:31.225\nunderstand that that's\nthe other type of network.\n\n172\n00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:35.381\nNow, the other network that was\nintroduced in Windows 7 was, well,\n\n173\n00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.570\nmaybe you don't have a lot of money.\n\n174\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.207\nMaybe you can't afford a server,\n\n175\n00:08:39.207 --> 00:08:41.746\nmaybe you're not a corporation\nthat needs to scale up\n\n176\n00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:45.484\nto quite literally a billion different\nobjects within your network, right.\n\n177\n00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:48.365\nActive Directory has got a lot of power,\n\n178\n00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:52.372\nit scales up to large enterprise networks,\nall right.\n\n179\n00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:55.870\nSo, what if I just have\na couple of computers, and\n\n180\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.230\nI need a really easy way to share\nthings among those few computers?\n\n181\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.766\nWell, that's where the third\ntype of network comes in and\n\n182\n00:09:02.766 --> 00:09:06.406\nthat's something known as a homegroup,\nand a homegroup is a real simplistic way.\n\n183\n00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:10.527\nYou can create it and\nthe computers that join your home network,\n\n184\n00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:15.450\nprovided they have a password,\nthey'll see that Homeroom.\n\n185\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.050\nThey'll challenge you for\nthe password if you want to join it.\n\n186\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.600\nYou enter the password and now,\nwe can share things like pictures, movies,\n\n187\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.010\nvideos if you will,\ndocuments if you choose to.\n\n188\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.890\nDocuments, I thinks by\ndefault is disabled.\n\n189\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.533\nBut things like your videos,\nyour pictures,\n\n190\n00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:33.477\nyour music, you can actually share\nwithin that small Home network.\n\n191\n00:09:33.477 --> 00:09:35.820\nAll right, so those are the three\ndifferent networking types.\n\n192\n00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.520\nNow, a lot of talk here,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n193\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.823\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you a little bit about how you would\n\n194\n00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:44.533\nsetup communications on the network,\nright.\n\n195\n00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:48.790\nWe gotta talk about what an IP address,\nwe talked about that in other episodes.\n\n196\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:53.758\nIf you haven't checked those episodes out\nYou got the accelerated episodes on things\n\n197\n00:09:53.758 --> 00:09:58.312\nlike TCPIP and IP address and so,\ndefinitely check them out, cuz we're gonna\n\n198\n00:09:58.312 --> 00:10:03.160\njust show you where you set that up here,\nnot really talk the individual settings.\n\n199\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.772\nAll right,\nwe're gonna look at the desktop here,\n\n200\n00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.380\nit looks like it's timed me out here so\nwe'll log back in, all right.\n\n201\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.221\nA couple different ways you can get\nto what is known as network and\n\n202\n00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.018\nsharing center.\n\n203\n00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:15.096\nThis is your common one stop shop for\n\n204\n00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:18.577\na lot of the network configurations\nthat you're gonna do.\n\n205\n00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:20.020\nNow, my heads kinda covering this one up.\n\n206\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.950\nRemember, we always show you\nmultiple ways to get to things.\n\n207\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.904\nNotice that down there on the bottom,\nthere's this little monitor icon and\n\n208\n00:10:26.904 --> 00:10:28.028\nit's interesting.\n\n209\n00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.220\nI used to call that\na little trident pitchfork.\n\n210\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's actually an ethernet cable.\n\n211\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.562\n&gt;&gt; It's a network cable.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a network cable.\n\n212\n00:10:33.562 --> 00:10:35.058\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, imagine why,\n\n213\n00:10:35.058 --> 00:10:37.200\nCaptain Obvious here at your service here.\n\n214\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.590\nSo if I right click on that,\n\n215\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.430\nyou'll see that I've got\na couple of things that I can do.\n\n216\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.540\nI can open up what's known\nas network trouble shooter,\n\n217\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.730\nif I feel that there's problems.\n\n218\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.760\nI can also go into network and\nsharing center.\n\n219\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.964\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndo that and when I do that,\n\n220\n00:10:50.964 --> 00:10:53.140\nthat takes me to this component.\n\n221\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.490\nAll right, this interface.\n\n222\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.724\nNow, there's another way that you can get\nthere too and we like to show you more\n\n223\n00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:01.007\nthan one way to get to pretty much the\nsame location, because like we've said in\n\n224\n00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:03.820\nthe past, they might ask you different\nways to get to these things.\n\n225\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.284\nSo if you get into your control panel,\nand this works for Vista, it works for\n\n226\n00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:09.409\nWindows 7, works for Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n227\n00:11:09.409 --> 00:11:13.477\nAll you gotta do is right click,\nif you're in 8.1, or if you're in 8,\n\n228\n00:11:13.477 --> 00:11:17.739\nright click on your Windows tile, push\nthe start button if you're in Vista and\n\n229\n00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:19.633\nWindows 7, go to control panel.\n\n230\n00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:21.390\nNetwork and internet.\n\n231\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.380\nAnd then, you'll see we have network and\nsharing center, right?\n\n232\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.780\nWe get into network and\nsharing center, and guess what?\n\n233\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.100\nSame utility, all right?\n\n234\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.735\nSo a couple different ways to get there.\n\n235\n00:11:30.735 --> 00:11:36.110\nNow, if I'm going to set up a new\nconnection, I can do that right here.\n\n236\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.820\nNow, we already got a connection, but\nlet me at least show you this, right?\n\n237\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.080\nSetting up a new connection or\nnetwork I could do that right here, and\n\n238\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.750\nthere's a few different\noptions that we have here.\n\n239\n00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.100\nOne of the things that we can do is we\ncan setup things like a wired network.\n\n240\n00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.860\nAll right, connection to the internet\nnow just broadband or dial-up and\n\n241\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.340\nit could be dial-up,\nyes you still have dial-up, right.\n\n242\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.240\nDial up is out there and even if some of\nyou might be saying, dial up, why would\n\n243\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.459\nanybody have that, trust me it still has\nit's utilization in today's networks.\n\n244\n00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:06.750\nBroadband, right, your wireless network.\n\n245\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.770\nSet up a network or new router or\naccess point and also do that, but\n\n246\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.960\nyou can also set up thinks like\na dial up or a VPN connection.\n\n247\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.600\nIf you need to set up\nyour VPN communications,\n\n248\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.480\nlike we've talked about in other episodes.\n\n249\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.330\nRemember the VPN,\n\n250\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.510\nwe're talking about that virtualized point\nto point connection over a public network.\n\n251\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.262\nWell, I could set that up right here.\n\n252\n00:12:26.262 --> 00:12:28.481\nNow, we've already got\na network connection, but\n\n253\n00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.014\nI did want to show you that you\nhave that option, all right.\n\n254\n00:12:31.014 --> 00:12:33.692\nNow, the other thing that\nwe can do is we can see\n\n255\n00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:36.726\nthe properties of an existing connection,\nright?\n\n256\n00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:38.670\nI can see that I'm part\nof a private network.\n\n257\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.520\nRemember when you get challenged\nthe first time you're setting up your\n\n258\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.360\nnetwork connections and post installation,\n\n259\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.840\nit says what kind of network\ndo you want to connect to.\n\n260\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.880\nThat's gonna set this choice right here.\n\n261\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.832\nI could also see that the homegroup has\nalready been created and it's joined, and\n\n262\n00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:55.439\nwe'll show you a little bit about that\nif you need to know a little bit more on\n\n263\n00:12:55.439 --> 00:12:58.782\nhow to create and set up the home group,\ncheck out our full episodes.\n\n264\n00:12:58.782 --> 00:13:01.068\nAgain, remember the accelerated episodes,\n\n265\n00:13:01.068 --> 00:13:05.310\nwe're gonna assume that you already\nknow what a homegroup is, all right?\n\n266\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.994\nAnd I can also see\nthe connections if I want to.\n\n267\n00:13:07.994 --> 00:13:11.910\nNow, a lot of times what we do, and I know\nDan this is something you've done probably\n\n268\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.683\nmore than you want to admit to, is we go\nto this change adaptor settings, right.\n\n269\n00:13:15.683 --> 00:13:17.990\nAnd that takes us into\nconnections as well.\n\n270\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.520\nNotice that network connections, that\nlittle hyperlink that we showed you on\n\n271\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.890\nthe last page,\nit would do the same thing, and\n\n272\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.800\nthese are the different\nnetwork connections you have.\n\n273\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.030\nThe network adaptors, right.\n\n274\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.700\nIn this case, this is your bluetooth.\n\n275\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.340\nObviously, you can see it isn't connected\nso we get some information on that.\n\n276\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.805\nAnd I also-\n&gt;&gt; That's what that red X means.\n\n277\n00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.607\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what that red X means.\n\n278\n00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:36.330\n&gt;&gt; I've been wondering.\n\n279\n00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.552\n&gt;&gt; I can almost tell you XMLer.\n\n280\n00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:41.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; XMLer, know what the red X means.\n\n281\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.690\nIt means that it's not connected.\n\n282\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.600\nNow, I'll also go ahead and\nwhy not show you what disable means too?\n\n283\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.721\nIf I right click, we're gonna some of\nthe right click options here in a second.\n\n284\n00:13:50.721 --> 00:13:54.106\nBut if your network adaptor is disabled,\nall right?\n\n285\n00:13:54.106 --> 00:13:58.714\nSometimes they might do something, and\nI'm gonna purposely zoom in here so\n\n286\n00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:02.320\nto show something that\nmight happen on the exam.\n\n287\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.720\nNotice that you still see\ndisabled until I zoom in.\n\n288\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.300\nIf I can get there, just a bit.\n\n289\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.773\nNotice how it is grayed out,\nnotice that you don't see anything right.\n\n290\n00:14:11.773 --> 00:14:13.010\nWell that could happen.\n\n291\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.525\nThat could be what they\ntell you on the exam,\n\n292\n00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:16.898\nwhat's wrong with this network adapter.\n\n293\n00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.480\nAnd they wanna prove that you have been\nhere long enough to know that it is\n\n294\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.530\ndisabled, right, that you're familiar\nenough with that to know why\n\n295\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.450\nyou would come in, see that network\nadapter, see that icon and why it wouldn't\n\n296\n00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.952\nhave more of the color in it that you can\nsee when it is enabled, so do know that.\n\n297\n00:14:32.952 --> 00:14:35.480\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n298\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.380\nwe'll right click on our ethernet adapter\nand there's a couple different options.\n\n299\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.640\nThe first option that we can do\nis we can look at status, and\n\n300\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.150\nwhen you look at status it gives you basic\ninformation about the network adapter,\n\n301\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.890\nmore specifically things like are you\nconnected, are you connected to IPv4,\n\n302\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.560\nyou can see yes, we are connected\nto the Internet, all right.\n\n303\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.212\nAm I connected IPv6?\n\n304\n00:14:54.212 --> 00:14:58.457\nIPv6 access is still fairly limited,\neven though that's becoming more and\n\n305\n00:14:58.457 --> 00:15:01.406\nmore prevalent,\nit's still kinda fairly limited.\n\n306\n00:15:01.406 --> 00:15:02.740\nInternet's kinda interesting,\n\n307\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.048\nhow does my computer know it's\nconnected to the internet?\n\n308\n00:15:05.048 --> 00:15:09.150\nWell that all relies on things like DNS,\nand it says, hey, let me go ahead, and\n\n309\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.050\nI'm gonna go out and do a time check,\nright, time synchronization.\n\n310\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.030\nSo it reaches out to time.windows.com and\n\n311\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.490\nif it can resolve that name via public DNS\nserver, and it could connect to there,\n\n312\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.510\nit says well,\nI've got to have Internet access.\n\n313\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.150\nIf it can't do that, that's when you'll\nget this little thought bubble down,\n\n314\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.470\nmy head's kind of covered it up.\n\n315\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.220\nIf that ever happens,\nwhere you'll get this little\n\n316\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.580\nthought bubble that'll come up and\nit'll say limited connectivity.\n\n317\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.970\nNotice how it says Internet access?\n\n318\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.299\nIt'll say limited connectivity right there\nor it might just say no Internet access.\n\n319\n00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:41.102\nSo again, couple little things.\n\n320\n00:15:41.102 --> 00:15:43.271\n&gt;&gt; The icon a lot of times\nwill have a little triangle,\n\n321\n00:15:43.271 --> 00:15:45.702\nyellow triangle with an exclamation\npoint on it as well?\n\n322\n00:15:45.702 --> 00:15:48.615\n&gt;&gt; Exam alert, exam alert, exam alert.\n\n323\n00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.925\nMan, you are full of great information and\nyou really got to know those things.\n\n324\n00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:54.037\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you start working at\na Help Desk, these are the things.\n\n325\n00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.833\nPeople call up and they say,\nI can't access our web site,\n\n326\n00:15:56.833 --> 00:16:00.029\nI don't know what the problem is\nI can't access any web site Okay,\n\n327\n00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:02.163\nlet me log in and\ntake a look at your desktop.\n\n328\n00:16:02.163 --> 00:16:06.625\nBoom, right hand corner, there's\nthe little exclamation point telling you\n\n329\n00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.070\nlimited or no Internet connection.\n\n330\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.080\nOr maybe the cable's become unplugged,\nit doesn't sense that.\n\n331\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.330\nThere's a litany of things.\n\n332\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.805\nAlways look out for\nthose visuals that Microsoft gives you.\n\n333\n00:16:14.805 --> 00:16:17.425\n&gt;&gt; And let me go ahead and\npiggyback off that thought process.\n\n334\n00:16:17.425 --> 00:16:19.205\nYou might be saying,\nwell wait a second here.\n\n335\n00:16:19.205 --> 00:16:21.595\nAren't they getting a little too picky,\nDan, on the exam?\n\n336\n00:16:21.595 --> 00:16:22.225\nNo they aren't.\n\n337\n00:16:22.225 --> 00:16:23.085\nRight?\nThe reason\n\n338\n00:16:23.085 --> 00:16:26.455\nDan knows that is because he's been in a\nhelp desk situation many more time than he\n\n339\n00:16:26.455 --> 00:16:30.385\nprobably would ever want to be in his\nlife and he knows it from memory.\n\n340\n00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:33.215\nBecause the person that you're supporting\nis in front of their computer and\n\n341\n00:16:33.215 --> 00:16:35.760\nyou have to kind of visualize\nwhat they're seeing\n\n342\n00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.670\nwhen they don't even know\nwhat a start button is, okay?\n\n343\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.640\nAnd I am not talking down to any end user\nbut you have to be able to support it.\n\n344\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.330\nSo that is why they want you to prove if\nyou are going to be an A+ technician that\n\n345\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.280\nyou know what you are doing.\n\n346\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.240\nSo great information there and\nI would heed the warning.\n\n347\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.184\nNow, some of the other things\nwe can get real quick,\n\n348\n00:16:52.184 --> 00:16:55.360\nwe can get things like additional\ninformation, right, details here.\n\n349\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.500\nI can see some of this information that\nI would see inside of the properties\n\n350\n00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.170\nof the network adaptor, the description,\nthings like a MAC address.\n\n351\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.590\nKeep in mind that remember that Windows,\nor\n\n352\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.550\nMicrosoft, they call\nit a physical address.\n\n353\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.820\nMost of the world out there calls\nit a media access control address.\n\n354\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.230\nAnd I'm not picking on Microsoft,\nthey also call it a MAC address as well.\n\n355\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.660\nBut they call it a physical address,\nversus a software-based logical address,\n\n356\n00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.150\nis their mindset behind it, which is\nyour IP address, subnet mask, right.\n\n357\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.460\nIf I'm using DHCP I can\nsee that it is enabled.\n\n358\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.100\nAnd I can see how long the Dynamic\nHost Configuration Protocol lease is,\n\n359\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.300\nas well as things like my default gateway,\nwhich is the router that you send\n\n360\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.640\ninformation to, to get it out there\nto the Internet, or very basically,\n\n361\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.980\nto another network,\nincluding what the DNS server is as well.\n\n362\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.320\nSo we can get some information and\n\n363\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.975\nit's good to have that quick\neasy breezy information.\n\n364\n00:17:49.975 --> 00:17:52.435\nNow if we go a little farther,\nwe can choose properties.\n\n365\n00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:55.605\nNow again, there is another\nway you can get to this too.\n\n366\n00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:58.435\nAgain, just by right clicking, and\nI think it's the background there.\n\n367\n00:17:58.435 --> 00:17:59.345\nI think I might have left that up.\n\n368\n00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:00.855\nYeah, there it is.\n\n369\n00:18:00.855 --> 00:18:04.195\nLet me go ahead, and I'll try again.\n\n370\n00:18:04.195 --> 00:18:05.795\nI'm clicking all over the place.\n\n371\n00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:08.975\nLet me go ahead and close that down real\nquick and then show you that you can right\n\n372\n00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:12.720\nclick and you can also choose properties\nhere, please know that as well.\n\n373\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.950\nNow what we're seeing here are protocols.\n\n374\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.740\nProtocol bindings is what they're called.\n\n375\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.410\nA protocol binding means your\ncomputer knows how to speak\n\n376\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.710\nthe rules of that communication, right,\nthat protocol, that's all it means.\n\n377\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.270\nIt means you have basically turned\non that protocol on the adapter, and\n\n378\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.830\nthere are some by default.\n\n379\n00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.710\nThere are some for installation,\nbut they're getting less and less.\n\n380\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.370\nYou can see like for instance protocols,\nI could add a protocol if I want.\n\n381\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.550\nAgain not a lot that we really\nneed to do to much today, so\n\n382\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.810\nI wouldn't worry about that,\nbut you do have that services.\n\n383\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.170\nLet me go ahead and cancel out of this.\n\n384\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.442\nLooks like it's giving me a problem here,\nI probably clicked on something and\n\n385\n00:18:52.442 --> 00:18:56.047\nit's going to give me a not responding\nhere, we'll just wait and talk about it.\n\n386\n00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:58.322\nLooks like I crashed\nthe whole entire computer.\n\n387\n00:18:58.322 --> 00:18:58.927\n&gt;&gt; Good job Wesley!\n\n388\n00:18:58.927 --> 00:19:00.636\n&gt;&gt; That is great, all right,\nthere, welcome back Windows.\n\n389\n00:19:00.636 --> 00:19:01.164\nAll right!\n\n390\n00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:02.623\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n391\n00:19:02.623 --> 00:19:08.461\nnothing like a good little\nuser mode blue screen.\n\n392\n00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:09.720\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What do we say?\n\n393\n00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.259\nJust because we're the professionals\nhere doesn't mean it's all candies and\n\n394\n00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:14.170\nrainbows, right?\n\n395\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:14.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No that's right.\n\n396\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.390\n&gt;&gt; This stuff breaks on us just\nlike it does everybody else and\n\n397\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.900\nwe have to work through it.\n\n398\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.985\n&gt;&gt; There's a reason we're\nprofessional mechanics.\n\n399\n00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we've done that before.\n\n400\n00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:23.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n401\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.125\nSo getting back into a swing and\na miss [LAUGH].\n\n402\n00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:27.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n403\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.970\ngetting back into our software here,\n\n404\n00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.240\nwe'll get back to the network adapter,\nwe'll right click,\n\n405\n00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.350\nwe'll choose properties, and we'll go\nahead and look at some of the protocols.\n\n406\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.720\nThese are the protocols that\nwe were looking at before.\n\n407\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.750\nMore specifically the one that we\ndeal with at least at this day and\n\n408\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.580\nage is IPv4, subject to change.\n\n409\n00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.250\nYou'll probably see more and\nmore of IPv6 support here likewise.\n\n410\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.540\nNow here's where you set DHCP,\nnotice it did say DHCP was enabled,\n\n411\n00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.760\nthat was obtaining an IP\naddress automatically.\n\n412\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.150\nI do not like the wording,\nI have never liked the wording,\n\n413\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.260\nespecially for people who are just\ngetting into the business,\n\n414\n00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.230\nbecause there is a truly\nautomatic IP address, right,\n\n415\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.730\nand that's actually set from the alternate\nconfiguration tab by default.\n\n416\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.150\nNotice, item automatic private IP address.\n\n417\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:18.270\nThis is a default configuration and\nit doesn't necessarily happen\n\n418\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.410\nautomatically and as a systems\nadministrator all I have to do is say,\n\n419\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.970\nhey Dan, was that DHCP server that\nyou configured set up automatically?\n\n420\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Not configured automatically.\n\n421\n00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so there's nothing\ntruly automatic about it, right?\n\n422\n00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.650\nIn the background when an administrator\nbrings a server online that's gonna be\n\n423\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.850\nusing DHCP there are some\nconfigurations that have to happen,\n\n424\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.880\nhowever If we can look at my\ncomputer here real quick,\n\n425\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.730\nthe alternate configuration\nis a zero config technology.\n\n426\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.030\nWhat it means is that when my computer\nconnects to the network, if it\n\n427\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.080\ncalls out for a DHCP address and says\nhey anybody out there got an IP address,\n\n428\n00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.670\nI need one, and all it hears is crickets,\nwell guess what,\n\n429\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.490\nit's gonna end up falling back to\nthe alternate configuration address.\n\n430\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.020\nSo those are great things to have.\n\n431\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.760\nThose are some of the things\nthat you can look at.\n\n432\n00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.150\nRemember that if you need to set a static\nIP address you can always set it\n\n433\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.200\nright here.\n\n434\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.550\nAnd this is where we can set our\nIP address, our subnet mask,\n\n435\n00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.110\nour default gateway, and\nuse our DNS servers for name resolution.\n\n436\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.100\nNow I don't really need to set\na default address, I'll go ahead and\n\n437\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.460\ncancel that out, cancel all of this.\n\n438\n00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.780\nBut just understand that this is where\nyou can set things like IP address, for\n\n439\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.520\nyour addressing, subnet mask,\nDNS, your gateway, fancy term for\n\n440\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.710\na router, if you will,\nand alternate addressing.\n\n441\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.610\nAll right, so those are some of the things\nthat I would definitely worry about,\n\n442\n00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.970\nremember some of the other\nthings that you might have for\n\n443\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:48.035\nyour establishing network connections are\nwireless wide area network connections,\n\n444\n00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:51.600\nWWANs, keep in mind that's\ncellular communications.\n\n445\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.790\nThat's essentially what that is, and\n\n446\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.770\ntypically what's gonna happen is you're\ngonna have some kind of cellular card.\n\n447\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.030\nA lot of times what you do is you usually\nhave some kind of software that'll do\n\n448\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.750\nthe configuration for you.\n\n449\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.900\nBut you pay attention again because\nwhen you are setting up cellular\n\n450\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.430\ncommunications, you usually have what\nare known as these mobile hotspots, and\n\n451\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.900\nthey essentially just act like a router.\n\n452\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.200\nThey're sitting close to your computer,\nand they act like DHCP, and\n\n453\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.550\nthey give you an IP address.\n\n454\n00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.700\nSo if you're sitting in a hotel or\nsomething like that, and\n\n455\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.370\nit allows you to connect\noutbound over the network.\n\n456\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.180\nSome of the other things that you might\nneed to know is you might need to set\n\n457\n00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.310\nproxy settings, right?\n\n458\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.290\nSo if I have things like for\ninstance I need to connect to a website,\n\n459\n00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:34.110\nand as a help desk I need to connect\nto a proxy server that's gonna\n\n460\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.300\nintercept my traffic and\nmake a web request on my behalf,\n\n461\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.530\nwell on that one you're gonna have to\ngo to the Internet options, all right?\n\n462\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.800\nSo let me show you here if you're\ninside of your Control Panel, so\n\n463\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.920\njust right clicking on your start button,\nchoosing Control Panel.\n\n464\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.400\nIf you change from Category View to\nLarge Icons, you will find in this list,\n\n465\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.360\nyou will find Internet options as well\nas the HomeGroup setup tool, know that.\n\n466\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.810\nSo here inside of the Internet Options,\nif I go to the connections tab,\n\n467\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.200\nnotice that I can set up things\nlike your connections here.\n\n468\n00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.890\nI could set that up right here,\nif I wanted to, as well.\n\n469\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.530\nBut I can also, more importantly,\nif I need proxy settings, I can go to\n\n470\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.630\nLocal Area Network, because my proxy is\ngoing to be on my Local Area Network, and\n\n471\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.840\nmake a web request on my behalf.\n\n472\n00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.730\nAnd if I needed to, notice that I\ncould do automatic configuration,\n\n473\n00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.360\nor we could use a proxy server here.\n\n474\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.460\nSo that's where you could set up your\nproxy configurations if you need to.\n\n475\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:36.280\nNow there might be times in which\nyou need to do things like, for\n\n476\n00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.250\ninstance, maybe setting\nup your home group.\n\n477\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.470\nLet me just show you what the home\ngroup settings would look like.\n\n478\n00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.452\nAgain, I'm already\nconnected to a home group.\n\n479\n00:23:46.452 --> 00:23:51.123\nAnd one of the things that I could do,\nis I could potentially, let's see, some of\n\n480\n00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:55.406\nthe advanced settings would be here in\nNetwork and Sharing Center as well.\n\n481\n00:23:55.406 --> 00:23:59.859\nAnd I could maybe potentially want\nto use my usernames and passwords,\n\n482\n00:23:59.859 --> 00:24:02.580\nto connect to your home group.\n\n483\n00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.870\nMaybe I wanna allow Windows to manage it.\n\n484\n00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.600\nAll of these settings, I really honestly,\nI would say just go ahead and\n\n485\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.260\nlet Windows manage them for you,\ncuz it's a lot easier that way.\n\n486\n00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:15.080\nOther things that you might have to do,\nyou might have\n\n487\n00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.560\nto make a connection to another computer\nin order to remotely manage it.\n\n488\n00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.493\nIf that happens, then you're gonna have to\nuse something known as the remote desktop\n\n489\n00:24:23.493 --> 00:24:25.105\nconnection software.\n\n490\n00:24:25.105 --> 00:24:27.932\nThis is a very cool piece of\nsoftware that you can utilize,\n\n491\n00:24:27.932 --> 00:24:30.657\nif you're gonna utilize that\nyou can right-click on.\n\n492\n00:24:30.657 --> 00:24:32.816\nWell, actually, there's a couple\nof different ways you can do this.\n\n493\n00:24:32.816 --> 00:24:39.216\nYou can go to the Start screen, and you\ncan actually type Remote if you want or\n\n494\n00:24:39.216 --> 00:24:45.830\nyou can type mstsc, and I don't even\nhave really type it all out anymore.\n\n495\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.910\nAnd we could do that likewise.\n\n496\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.740\nSo if I opened up Remote Desktop\nConnection, it would allow me to type\n\n497\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.190\nthe name of the computer that I\nwanna connect to or its IP address.\n\n498\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.670\nI could connect over the network to\nanother computer, and that other computer,\n\n499\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.910\nI could remotely take care of.\n\n500\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:08.270\nThat's taking control of that remote\ndesktop, its desktop to manage it.\n\n501\n00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.200\nIf I needed to adjust\nsome of the settings,\n\n502\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.670\nI could do that by clicking Show options.\n\n503\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.340\nI would know some of the different\nthings that you can do in here,\n\n504\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.240\nlike modifying things like Display.\n\n505\n00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.740\nThe Experience.\n\n506\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.685\nas well as Advanced, you can set\nup things like Gateways and stuff,\n\n507\n00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:25.226\nif you will,\nincluding things like the local resources.\n\n508\n00:25:25.226 --> 00:25:28.364\nIf I wanna give the remote computer\naccess to like a thumb drive,\n\n509\n00:25:28.364 --> 00:25:31.385\nmaybe I've got a driver that I\nwanna send over to the network,\n\n510\n00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:33.612\ncuz I'm remotely configuring that device.\n\n511\n00:25:33.612 --> 00:25:34.974\nI could choose more here, and\n\n512\n00:25:34.974 --> 00:25:38.090\nI could choose the different drives\nthat I wanna give an access too.\n\n513\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.498\nSo great little piece of software.\n\n514\n00:25:39.498 --> 00:25:42.440\nMaybe I wanna show somebody,\nremotely, how to maybe run like\n\n515\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.733\na virus scan on their computer,\nbecause I'm doing remote support.\n\n516\n00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:48.597\nWell, that's where something like\nremote assistance would come in.\n\n517\n00:25:48.597 --> 00:25:52.346\nA great little utility there too,\nif you need to get to remote assistance,\n\n518\n00:25:52.346 --> 00:25:56.630\nyou can just go to your Start button, your\nStart screen, I keep saying Start button,\n\n519\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.890\nStart screen.\n\n520\n00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:03.827\nAnd any run line command, or any run line\nbox, dialog box, you could type msra.\n\n521\n00:26:03.827 --> 00:26:08.732\nAnd that would bring up your\nMicrosoft Remote Assistance Executable,\n\n522\n00:26:08.732 --> 00:26:12.817\nand you could either invite\nsomebody you trust to help you,\n\n523\n00:26:12.817 --> 00:26:16.097\nby sending something\nlike an invitation file.\n\n524\n00:26:16.097 --> 00:26:17.900\nYou send an invitation file.\n\n525\n00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.860\nAll they have to do is grab that file.\n\n526\n00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.670\nThey click on it.\n\n527\n00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.000\nIt opens up a password.\n\n528\n00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.760\nThey type the password, and now both of\nyou guys can see and share the desktop,\n\n529\n00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.150\nversus remote desktop which actually lets\nyou just control that person's desktop,\n\n530\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.170\nbut it doesn't allow them\nto see what's going on.\n\n531\n00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.660\nSo those are a couple of things\nthat you have too, to keep in mind.\n\n532\n00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.840\nLast thing that I wanna just briefly\nmention, you also have things like shares.\n\n533\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.240\nRemember, shares are a remote resource\nthat is available over the network.\n\n534\n00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.310\nYou can setup network shares,\nlet me show you.\n\n535\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.868\nThere's also administrative shares too,\n\n536\n00:26:54.868 --> 00:26:58.265\nI just happen to be logged\ninto an administrator account.\n\n537\n00:26:58.265 --> 00:27:01.450\nAnd if I want to see a remote folder or\nmaybe even,\n\n538\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:06.135\nin this case, connect to a remote printer,\nthey're also shares too.\n\n539\n00:27:06.135 --> 00:27:09.626\nI would enter a UNC path, and\n\n540\n00:27:09.626 --> 00:27:14.740\nthat's \\\\compute name\\sharename.\n\n541\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.308\nNow this is not exactly how you'll do it.\n\n542\n00:27:16.308 --> 00:27:17.866\nI'll show you, but\n\n543\n00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:23.649\nI just wanted to kinda zoom into what\nthe universal naming convention was.\n\n544\n00:27:23.649 --> 00:27:24.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was about to say, and\n\n545\n00:27:24.838 --> 00:27:27.420\nreminding us that UNC is universal\nnaming convention correct?\n\n546\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:27.930\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n547\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.060\nAnd that's, I'm glad you mentioned it.\n\n548\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.610\nBecause of the fact that it might\nbe something that they call\n\n549\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.481\nyou out on the exam.\n\n550\n00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:36.255\nUnderstand it's not\n\\computername\\\\sharename,\n\n551\n00:27:36.255 --> 00:27:39.311\nit's exactly what we're showing you here.\n\n552\n00:27:39.311 --> 00:27:41.345\n[INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Plus they like to and\n\n553\n00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:43.434\nwhen they're formatting\nquestions they'll say,\n\n554\n00:27:43.434 --> 00:27:45.816\nwhich one of these things is\nused in mapping shared drives?\n\n555\n00:27:45.816 --> 00:27:51.714\nAnd it'll be, DHCP, IP, MAC or UNC?\n\n556\n00:27:51.714 --> 00:27:55.036\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; if you know what UNC means,\n\n557\n00:27:55.036 --> 00:27:57.176\nthat kind of thing can happen,\nso you gotta be prepared.\n\n558\n00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:59.464\n&gt;&gt; That's right because it\nmight just be a protocol,\n\n559\n00:27:59.464 --> 00:28:01.040\nDNS is not the right answer [LAUGH].\n\n560\n00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.270\nAnd again, it sounds like were nit\npicking but were doing that for a reason,\n\n561\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.740\nwe want you to be prepared.\n\n562\n00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.660\nSo I do have one, I'm Pretty sure\nI could still communicate with.\n\n563\n00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.940\nWe're gonna go off the beaten path.\n\n564\n00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.310\nActually you can see some of\nthe network shares that are available.\n\n565\n00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.576\nThese are actually computers\nwithin our network there.\n\n566\n00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:19.714\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could potentially connect to these and\n\n567\n00:28:19.714 --> 00:28:21.709\nthen connect to their shares there.\n\n568\n00:28:21.709 --> 00:28:23.920\nSo those are network shares.\n\n569\n00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.120\nKeep in mind that they're\nalso administrative shares.\n\n570\n00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.055\nAnd administrative shares are typically\n\n571\n00:28:28.055 --> 00:28:36.770\n\\\\computername\\sharename$.\n\n572\n00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.350\nSo notice dollar sign here.\n\n573\n00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.240\nAgain, oops sorry about that,\nlet me try that again.\n\n574\n00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.490\nIt's running through my\nrecents lists there.\n\n575\n00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.241\nYou don't wanna see that.\n\n576\n00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:53.647\nSo \\\\sharename\\,\nnow I'm really messing myself up.\n\n577\n00:28:53.647 --> 00:28:54.286\n&gt;&gt; You can do this.\n\n578\n00:28:54.286 --> 00:28:54.902\n&gt;&gt; I can do it, I can do it.\n\n579\n00:28:54.902 --> 00:28:56.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have faith in myself.\n\n580\n00:28:56.643 --> 00:29:01.428\n\\\\computername\\sharename$.\n\n581\n00:29:01.428 --> 00:29:04.979\nAgain, these hidden shares, or\nthese administrative shares,\n\n582\n00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:07.440\na couple of things are going on here.\n\n583\n00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.690\nAn administrative sharer,\nyou have to be an administrator to see.\n\n584\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:14.569\nA hidden share with the dollar sign just\nmeans that it's not going to show up\n\n585\n00:29:14.569 --> 00:29:16.302\nin this list, like all these do.\n\n586\n00:29:16.302 --> 00:29:18.739\nThese aren't hidden.\n\n587\n00:29:18.739 --> 00:29:22.769\nI can hide any one of these shares if I\nwanted to, just by typing out the full\n\n588\n00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:27.124\ncomputer name and then when the share name\nis, what I could do is do whatever that\n\n589\n00:29:27.124 --> 00:29:30.711\nshare name is, put a dollar sign\non the end of it, and it hides it.\n\n590\n00:29:30.711 --> 00:29:32.500\nAnd that might be something you want.\n\n591\n00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Wes, do they show up when\nyou're doing network browsing?\n\n592\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.450\n&gt;&gt; The hidden shares?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the hidden shares.\n\n593\n00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.290\n&gt;&gt; No, they do not, no they do not.\n\n594\n00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:42.339\nAnd that might be exactly why you wanna\ndo something like that right there.\n\n595\n00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.340\nYou also have some built\nin shares already.\n\n596\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.220\nSo if I right click on my Start menu and\nI go to computer management here,\n\n597\n00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.580\nyou can management your share\nfrom your Share Folders mode.\n\n598\n00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.960\nSo I could set up administrative,\nI could set up Shares here.\n\n599\n00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.056\nThese are some of the administrative\nshares that you have.\n\n600\n00:29:59.056 --> 00:30:01.041\nAnd it's C$ sign.\n\n601\n00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:06.471\nSo for instance, if I wanted to get\nto this computer's local hard drive,\n\n602\n00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:10.851\nand I'm an administrator,and\nI'm on another computer,\n\n603\n00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:16.104\nwhat I would do is I would type in\nthis computer's computer name \\C$,\n\n604\n00:30:16.104 --> 00:30:18.669\nand that will allow me to connect.\n\n605\n00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:23.041\nI know we're just about running on time,\nlast thing I kinda wanna mention is\n\n606\n00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:27.641\nthat you can also do things like mapping\nprinters inside of your computers too.\n\n607\n00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:32.326\nAnd if you're gonna map printers,\nthe place that you can do that,\n\n608\n00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:36.520\nif we go into category view and\nwe're in the control panel.\n\n609\n00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.490\nWe go to hardware and sound.\n\n610\n00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:43.760\nYou can go to device and printers,\nand you can choose here Add printer.\n\n611\n00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.519\nAnd let's see,\nlocal printer spooler service.\n\n612\n00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:53.172\nOkay, this is, hey I didn't\nprepare this to happen on camera.\n\n613\n00:30:53.172 --> 00:30:55.099\nBut this is great,\nprinter troubleshooting.\n\n614\n00:30:55.099 --> 00:30:59.275\nIt doesn't matter if you're talking about\na local printer that's connected to your\n\n615\n00:30:59.275 --> 00:31:03.289\nmachine, or a printer that you're gonna\nsend this print job over the network to.\n\n616\n00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:05.130\nYou have what's known as a print spooler.\n\n617\n00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.750\nThe print spooler essentially\nruns the entire printing process.\n\n618\n00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.330\nEven if you're gonna hand it\noff to a network printer.\n\n619\n00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.690\nSo when I went to add a printer, notice it\nsaid, I can't do that cuz the printer or\n\n620\n00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.680\nservice isn't even available.\n\n621\n00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.010\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you real quick where we can fix that.\n\n622\n00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.240\nWe're gonna go to something else that\nwe've shown you in other episodes.\n\n623\n00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.670\nWe're gonna go to our command line.\n\n624\n00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:31.300\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\nwe'll open up computer management.\n\n625\n00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.672\nAnd we're gonna go to services and\napplications.\n\n626\n00:31:34.672 --> 00:31:36.547\nThe services and application node,\n\n627\n00:31:36.547 --> 00:31:40.124\neasy way to do this click the Name\ncolumn one time and type the letter p.\n\n628\n00:31:40.124 --> 00:31:41.910\nAnd guess what, right there in the list.\n\n629\n00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.840\nFourth down from the top,\nyou will see Print Spooler.\n\n630\n00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.070\nAnd if I had to guess, I could see\nthat it is not running right now or\n\n631\n00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.660\nit isn't running.\n\n632\n00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.270\nWe'll try a little bit\nbetter English there.\n\n633\n00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.070\nChoose Automatic.\n\n634\n00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.890\nNotice that I can't start it yet\nbecause I haven't applied the settings.\n\n635\n00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.508\nNow once I've applied the settings there,\nI can then right-click on it and\n\n636\n00:32:01.508 --> 00:32:02.382\nchose Start.\n\n637\n00:32:02.382 --> 00:32:06.598\nWe'll give it a second to start,\nwe close down our services console,\n\n638\n00:32:06.598 --> 00:32:11.140\nand now we should be able to find\nPrinters, these are network printers.\n\n639\n00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.000\nThese network printers, if you will,\nare printers that have been shared out.\n\n640\n00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.890\nIf I have a printer that's connected\nlocally to my computer, I can\n\n641\n00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.340\nshare it like these computers have already\ndone to these printers in the list.\n\n642\n00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.520\nIf you're mapping to a network printer,\n\n643\n00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.870\nyou're essentially going to\nconnect to one of these printers.\n\n644\n00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.230\nLet's see if it'll let me do it, and\n\n645\n00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.050\nit's going to go through the process\nof installing that printer.\n\n646\n00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.680\nOnce that print driver\nhas been installed and\n\n647\n00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.000\nyou are communicating with the printer,\nyou will be able to name it if you will,\n\n648\n00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.390\nand we'll call that,\nwe'll just call it NetPrinter.\n\n649\n00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.470\nSo it's easier for me to remember.\n\n650\n00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.750\nThen I'll choose Next and I'll call it,\nI can actually turn around and\n\n651\n00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.420\nshare this myself if I wanted to.\n\n652\n00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.890\nIt might give me a hard time on that one.\n\n653\n00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.620\nSometimes it does cuz it's already,\nno it didn't, and\n\n654\n00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.220\nthen I choose Finish, and\nthen I should find this in the list here.\n\n655\n00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.980\nLet me scroll down.\n\n656\n00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.710\nI bet you it's just off of camera there.\n\n657\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.210\nI have a net printer and\nwe are ready to go.\n\n658\n00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.660\nSo a couple of things\nthat you need to know for\n\n659\n00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.320\nyour Window's compliant networking.\n\n660\n00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.881\nKeep in mind, if this was a little bit\nover your head when it comes to IP\n\n661\n00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:16.640\naddresses, subnet and gateways and DNS.\n\n662\n00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.290\nWe've got plenty of other episodes\ninside of the accelerated course,\n\n663\n00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.670\nthat we'll show you what\nthose concepts are.\n\n664\n00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:23.350\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWes,\n\n665\n00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.040\ngreat stuff when it comes\nto Windows networking.\n\n666\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.243\nYou've got to be familiar\nwith those things.\n\n667\n00:33:26.243 --> 00:33:29.539\nBecause well, odds are you're going\nto be working with a Windows system,\n\n668\n00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:32.102\nand odds are they're going to\nhave networking issues, so\n\n669\n00:33:32.102 --> 00:33:34.271\nyou got to be able to\ntroubleshoot that for them.\n\n670\n00:33:34.271 --> 00:33:36.420\nAnd it's just good to know\nas general knowledge.\n\n671\n00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.190\nWes, thanks so much for\napplying your knowledge to us.\n\n672\n00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.850\nHopefully now we'll impart that into\nourselves, and be better at our work.\n\n673\n00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.340\nWes, it looks like we've run out of\ntime for this episode though, so\n\n674\n00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.030\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n675\n00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.520\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n676\n00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.414\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n677\n00:33:50.414 --> 00:33:52.840\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n678\n00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.885\n[MUSIC]\n\n679\n00:33:58.885 --> 00:34:03.400\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

--> 00:00:13.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.375\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.030\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.510\nI hope that you like A+ accelerated\ncontent because guess what?\n\n7\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.670\nThat's what we're doing today,\nA+ accelerated.\n\n8\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.310\nJoining us back in the studio to hammer\nthe gas back down, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.100\nWes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.020\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.153\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, as always.\n\n12\n00:00:33.153 --> 00:00:36.049\nAnd really just excited to be in\nthe accelerated track, especially for\n\n13\n00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:39.060\nsome of you that maybe have some\nof this under your belt already.\n\n14\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.200\nMaybe you've already watched\nthe full track that we have,\n\n15\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.550\nthe other courses that we have,\n901 and 902.\n\n16\n00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.870\nAnd maybe you're ready to\nsit the hot seat, right?\n\n17\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.620\nYou're ready to just get in\nthere in the exam booth, and\n\n18\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.160\nyou just want a quick recap.\n\n19\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.270\nOr maybe some of you guys that\nhave been in the field, and\n\n20\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.800\nyou just need a direction into, yeah,\nI already know the technologies.\n\n21\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.860\nI just kinda gotta understand what is\nit that they can potentially ask me\n\n22\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.424\non the exam.\n\n23\n00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:02.862\nIt's great to have you guys and gals out\nhere in TV LAN, or again, computer LAN,\n\n24\n00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.427\nthere's all different avenues for ITProTV.\n\n25\n00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:07.090\nEither way, glad to be here.\n\n26\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.840\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n27\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.345\nwe're gonna dive into something\nknown as Windows disk management.\n\n28\n00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.514\n&gt;&gt; Dun, dun, dun.\n\n29\n00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:13.836\n&gt;&gt; That's right, drumroll, please, right?\n\n30\n00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:14.971\nI'm not gonna even try that.\n\n31\n00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:17.359\nOur poor director out there would be like,\nmy ears hurt.\n\n32\n00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n33\n00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:24.096\nwhen we talk about disk management,\nright, in other episodes,\n\n34\n00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:28.023\nwe've talked about how we get the\noperating system on the disks themselves.\n\n35\n00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:32.815\nAnd in some of the more 901 type centric\nstuff, we've talked about the hard drives,\n\n36\n00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:36.992\nbut we really gotta talk about how we\nactually manage those drives, right?\n\n37\n00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:40.030\nHow do we prepare them,\nif we will, for data?\n\n38\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.460\nWe also have to know a little bit\nabout the filing systems, right,\n\n39\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.320\nin the installation shows, right?\n\n40\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.111\nWe had a Windows features and\ninstallation show.\n\n41\n00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:49.383\nWe showed you how to install\nthe operating system, but\n\n42\n00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:52.670\nwe really didn't talk about\nthe file system, right?\n\n43\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.296\nAnd what's kinda interesting is,\nit didn't really give you a choice, right?\n\n44\n00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:59.239\nYou installed the operating system, and\n\n45\n00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.623\nthen you just gotta accept the file\nsystem that they give you.\n\n46\n00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.020\nWhat file system is that gonna be?\n\n47\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.310\nAnd that's some of the things that\nwe're gonna dive into in this episode.\n\n48\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.890\nAll right, now when it comes to disk\nmanagement, we have a couple different\n\n49\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.830\noptions that we can utilize when\nwe're gonna manage the disk.\n\n50\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.940\nKeep in mind we always have\na graphical user interface.\n\n51\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.041\nThat's one of the things that, one of\nthe reasons people kind of gravitate\n\n52\n00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.313\ntowards Windows is because it\ndoes have a Windows desktop.\n\n53\n00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:28.168\nIt has a kind of user friendly interface,\nunlike some of the other\n\n54\n00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:32.590\noperating systems, which all you\nmight see is a terminal or shell.\n\n55\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.580\nWell, keep in mind that even inside of\nWindows too, you can manage your disks\n\n56\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.780\nthrough the command prompt, right, through\na non-GUI based environment, right?\n\n57\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.906\nWhere we have text based input,\nand we get text based output.\n\n58\n00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:49.258\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just kind of\nshow you some of the different things that\n\n59\n00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:51.000\nyou can do with both of these interfaces.\n\n60\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.950\nAgain, if you want a little\nbit more of a full definition,\n\n61\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.320\ndefinitely check out the complete course.\n\n62\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.947\nIt's one of the things\nthat we have it there for.\n\n63\n00:02:57.947 --> 00:02:58.999\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n64\n00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.688\nwe're gonna dive into our Windows\n8.1 machine that we've been using.\n\n65\n00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:07.110\nKeep in mind that most of this\ndoesn't change for Windows 7.\n\n66\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.240\nWith Windows 7 and even really with Vista,\n\n67\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.226\ndisk management is one of the utilities\nthat we've used for a good long while now.\n\n68\n00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.660\nAnd there's a couple of different\nplaces that you can find it.\n\n69\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.570\nI'm gonna kind of show you a couple\ndifferent ways that you can get to\n\n70\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.280\nit here in Windows 8.1.\n\n71\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.088\nOne of the things that I absolutely love\nis because you might have to deal with\n\n72\n00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:27.612\ndisks day in and day out, they put\nit right there in those quick links.\n\n73\n00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:29.650\nAnd that's really, really good to have.\n\n74\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.630\nBut I also want you to know it's\nin computer management, and\n\n75\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.330\nin other episodes, guys,\nwe've kind of beat that horse to\n\n76\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.320\ndeath when it comes to the different\nways you get to computer management.\n\n77\n00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.773\nBut I do want you to understand\nthat it is here too.\n\n78\n00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:45.584\nAnd that applies to all the different\noperating systems, again, Vista,\n\n79\n00:03:45.584 --> 00:03:49.500\nWindows 7, 8, 8.1,\nyou can get to it likewise here.\n\n80\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.840\nNow that is the other\nplace that you can go.\n\n81\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.707\nKeep in mind that when you use disk\nmanagement in and of itself, by itself,\n\n82\n00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:59.588\nyou might get a little\nbit more real estate.\n\n83\n00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:02.033\nAnd you'll see here,\nit's kind of minimized by default.\n\n84\n00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:06.345\nAnd there's not really anything I\ncan do until I interact with this\n\n85\n00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.020\nmain pop up dialog box.\n\n86\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.568\nAnd that's kind of the next\nthing that I wanna talk about,\n\n87\n00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:11.929\ninitializing a disk, right?\n\n88\n00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:16.383\nWhen we first install the hard drives and\nunderstand, I'm talking not what you're\n\n89\n00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:21.220\nseeing here, I'm talking quite literally,\nwe've powered the device off, right?\n\n90\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.660\nWe've taken our 15-pin SATA cable,\nwe plugged it into the power.\n\n91\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.490\nWe've taken our 7-pin data cable, right,\nwe plugged it in the back of a hard drive.\n\n92\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.720\nWe put it back into the drive bay.\n\n93\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.460\nWe've closed the case up, and\nwe've turned it on for the first time.\n\n94\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.680\nThis is what you see, all right?\n\n95\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.811\nUnless you're talking about\nan installation drive,\n\n96\n00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.727\nif you're talking about a drive and\nthat's the only drive you have in it and\n\n97\n00:04:42.727 --> 00:04:45.014\nit's clean,\nthen you're not going to see these things.\n\n98\n00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:46.974\nWhat you're gonna end up seeing is well,\n\n99\n00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:50.566\nyou're gonna end up seeing that you\nhave to install your operating system.\n\n100\n00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:55.265\nSo what you're seeing here are additional\ndata drives, drives that have been\n\n101\n00:04:55.265 --> 00:05:00.200\nadded after the operating system that's\nalready running, has been installed.\n\n102\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.910\nBut the thing is, they're asking\nus to make some choices, right?\n\n103\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.765\nThese disks are offline,\nif you will, there's nothing.\n\n104\n00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:08.573\n&gt;&gt; They're just kind of sitting there,\nhanging out, waiting for\n\n105\n00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:10.869\nsomeone to come along and\nclean them up as their own.\n\n106\n00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:13.420\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so what's happening\nwhen we initialize a disk?\n\n107\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.290\nWell, there's a couple of things\nthat are happening, right?\n\n108\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.440\nOne of the things is the first\ntime Windows talks to it,\n\n109\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.700\nit assigns some information to it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.160\nOne of the things it\nassigns is a drive ID, so\n\n111\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.950\nthat it can identify that disk uniquely\nwithin maybe a series of disks, right?\n\n112\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.410\nWe have to be able to identify and\ndifferentiate disk 1 from disk 2.\n\n113\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.960\nNow, we see it as disk 1, disk 2, right?\n\n114\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.655\nIn the operating systems, it's usually a\nlong GUID number that you typically don't\n\n115\n00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:40.155\nsee, unless you dig really deep.\n\n116\n00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:44.510\nAnd they're certainly not gonna\nask you to do that on the A+ exam.\n\n117\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.694\nNow the other thing that it's gonna do is\nit's gonna apply an architecture to this,\n\n118\n00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:51.240\na structure like I said.\n\n119\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.660\nWhat are we talking about when\nwe say architecture, right?\n\n120\n00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.302\nWell, how you wanna utilize\nthe totality of this drive,\n\n121\n00:05:59.302 --> 00:06:04.149\nthe capacity of this drive,\nis really going to be up to you.\n\n122\n00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:06.099\nBut you have to know\nwhat choices you have and\n\n123\n00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.210\nwhy you might choose one over the other,\nall right?\n\n124\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.920\nYou can see here that there are two\ndifferent options, master boot record, and\n\n125\n00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.190\nthere's what's known as GPT or\nthe GUID partition table, right?\n\n126\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.060\nWe've talked about in other episodes\nwhat a GUID is when we talked about our\n\n127\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.810\ninstaller, right?\n\n128\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.619\nWe talked about a globally\nunique identifier.\n\n129\n00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.830\nWhat are we talking about here?\n\n130\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.277\nAll right, well what we're talking\nabout is how the bootloader master boot\n\n131\n00:06:29.277 --> 00:06:35.080\nrecord is going to be configured, right,\nthe architecture of the boot loader.\n\n132\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.542\nAll right, now when we talk about an MBR,\nmaster boot record,\n\n133\n00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:39.550\nmaster boot record's been around for\na long time.\n\n134\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.260\nThis goes back to\nthe early days of buy offs.\n\n135\n00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.529\nRemember, when your computer boots up,\nright,\n\n136\n00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.310\nbuy offs is initiating the hardware.\n\n137\n00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.450\nIt's stabilizing it,\nmaking sure that all the power's even,\n\n138\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.590\nmaking sure that the devices are present.\n\n139\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.976\nAnd then once that's done,\nthe operating system doesn't have to worry\n\n140\n00:06:56.976 --> 00:06:59.262\nabout all that initialization\nof the hardware.\n\n141\n00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:02.673\nThe BIOS says let me find the boot code,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:05.450\nI gotta bootstrap the operating system.\n\n143\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.900\nWell, you have two different\ntypes of boot codes.\n\n144\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.100\nYou have what's known as a master\nboot record, and you have GPT.\n\n145\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.040\nThe master boot record\nkinda looks like this.\n\n146\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.480\nNow I don't know if they're\ngonna ask you this complexity.\n\n147\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.960\nI certainly wouldn't worry\nabout end of sector, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.535\nThat's just kinda, again,\nit's mapping out the drive.\n\n149\n00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:25.690\nIt's letting the operating system know and\nthe BIOS,\n\n150\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.780\nif you will,\nwhat is inside of this drive, right?\n\n151\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.830\nWhat is the boot code,\nas well as the operating system?\n\n152\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.756\nNow the master boot record, right,\nit works with traditional BIOS.\n\n153\n00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:41.300\nIt's called Basic Input Output System,\nit does have a limitation.\n\n154\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.529\nIt has a limitation of four\nprimary partitions, all right?\n\n155\n00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.679\nAnd technically four partitions,\nbut they're primary partitions.\n\n156\n00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:52.912\nAnd the fact that a primary partition\nis really just a partition that's got\n\n157\n00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:54.534\na file system applied to it.\n\n158\n00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:57.793\nWe'll talk about the choices and\nfile systems coming up there, Dan.\n\n159\n00:07:57.793 --> 00:08:03.221\nBut for now, understand that a primary\npartition has a file system applied to it.\n\n160\n00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:07.937\nNow, one of the things that they kind of\ndid to try to about security way kinda low\n\n161\n00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:13.140\nhack around the four primary partition\nlimitations as they say, do you know what?\n\n162\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.670\nYou can make one of these partitions\nwhat is known as an extended partition.\n\n163\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.290\nIf you configure that as an extended\npartition than inside of this container,\n\n164\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.110\nthis logical division of this drive,\nright?\n\n165\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.060\nYou got one whole hard drive, right?\n\n166\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.371\nAnd in the software logically,\nyou're gonna put four walls in it.\n\n167\n00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:36.664\nBut if you make this last one here\nan extended partition, will let you\n\n168\n00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:41.920\nfurther divide that up into what's\nknown as logical volumes, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.025\nAnd that's what you get today,\nif you use a master boot record, right?\n\n170\n00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.150\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n171\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.950\nNow, Intel, quite a few years ago, they\nsaid, you know what?, this is outdated.\n\n172\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.950\nAll right.\nThis is outdated,\n\n173\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.330\nit's got some limitations,\n\n174\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.300\nthe other thing about the master boot\nrecord is there is no redundancy.\n\n175\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.020\nIf this master boot code here that\nboot straps the operating system,\n\n176\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.150\nif it gets corrupted, guess what?\n\n177\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:10.420\nBIOS says, I've done my job, my job was to\nfind the master boot record, I found it.\n\n178\n00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.480\nWell, it doesn't work.\n\n179\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.742\nI don't care,\nmy job was just to find it, right?\n\n180\n00:09:13.742 --> 00:09:16.355\nAnd this is one of the reasons that\nyou can have a failure to boot\n\n181\n00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.075\nThe Master Boot Record gets corrupted.\n\n182\n00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:19.275\nIt could be a boot loader virus.\n\n183\n00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:21.305\nIt could be a corruption\nof the hard drive.\n\n184\n00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:22.755\nSo, Intel's smart and\n\n185\n00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:25.485\nwise like Intel's done on a lot\nof things leading the industry.\n\n186\n00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:27.305\nSay, hey,\nwe need to come up with a new platform.\n\n187\n00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:29.985\nAnd they came out with a new firmware, or\n\n188\n00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:35.405\nBIOS type platform called\nextensible thermo interface, EFI.\n\n189\n00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:39.590\nWell, Intel and\na lot of other manufacturers have done\n\n190\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.150\nthis where they want something\nto become not vendor specific.\n\n191\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.430\nBut they say, hey,\nwe want everybody to use this.\n\n192\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.510\nSo, they said,\nlet's give EFI over to the world.\n\n193\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.410\nAnd what happened was a consortium\nof manufacturers said, okay,\n\n194\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.390\nwe're gonna oversee this,\n\n195\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.000\nnot manufacturers, really an independent\nbody said, we're gonna oversee this.\n\n196\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.980\nAnd we're gonna call it UEFI,\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n197\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.130\nAnd all that does is kind of separates\nthe earliest implementations, the Intel\n\n198\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.915\nimplementations, from now what becomes\nbasically a universal standard, right?\n\n199\n00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:11.275\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface,\n\n200\n00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:15.936\nnow Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\nstill has to find a boot record, right?\n\n201\n00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:19.420\nIt still has to find boot code,\nnothing changes, right?\n\n202\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.370\nI need to find the boot code\nthat can load into RAM,\n\n203\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.540\nit can start the operating system, so\nthat the operating system can take control\n\n204\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.720\nof the hardware, and it's not just\na glorified paperweight, right?\n\n205\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.980\nAnd expensive at that.\n\n206\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.647\nSo, UEFI systems don't look for\na master boot record, now, they\n\n207\n00:10:35.647 --> 00:10:40.560\ncan use a master boot record, because it's\nprotected for backwards compatibility, so\n\n208\n00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.489\nthat if you've got a UEFI system,\nand you've got some kind of legacy,\n\n209\n00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:47.930\nand you need to still boot up\na master boot record, you can.\n\n210\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.420\nBut what you UEFI systems look for\nis what's known as a GPT.\n\n211\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.790\nThat's a GUI partition table, now the GUI\npartition table looks something like this.\n\n212\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.710\nNow, I don't know if they gonna\ngo into this depth on the exam.\n\n213\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.944\nSo, here is the main point,\nif you wanna stop, or\n\n214\n00:11:02.944 --> 00:11:06.037\nyou wanna do more research\non this by all means.\n\n215\n00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:08.550\nThere is a view that\nare going on windows string.\n\n216\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.970\nThose of you that are going\ninto things like Linux,\n\n217\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.440\nyou might have to know stuff like this.\n\n218\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.460\nRight?, you might have to get down and\nreally make some manipulations, or\n\n219\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.290\nmodifications to some of this information,\nbut understand, here's the basic thing.\n\n220\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:26.780\nGPT blows the socks off of master\nboot record when it comes to\n\n221\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.240\nthat four partition limitation.\n\n222\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.070\nIt has up to 128 partitions, and\nthey're not even really called partitions.\n\n223\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.580\nThey're really, it looks for\nwhat are known as Goits.\n\n224\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.540\nThese software entries.\n\n225\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.780\n&gt;&gt; That is specific to Windows,\nthe 128 partitions,\n\n226\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.764\nthat is a GPT specific,\nbecause I thought GPT had like limitless.\n\n227\n00:11:46.764 --> 00:11:51.330\n&gt;&gt; No, you know, honestly,\nI'm going to have to say, hey,\n\n228\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.350\nI'll defer to I don't know on that one,\nbecause I'm pretty\n\n229\n00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:02.100\nsure 64 bit memory wise is limitless,\nbut I believe that is a feature\n\n230\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.960\nof GUI partition table,\nbecause and let me tell you why.\n\n231\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.690\nMicrosoft had to redo their boot loader.\n\n232\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.220\nIn the days of XP,\nwe had what was known as the NTLDR and\n\n233\n00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.090\nit followed a specific format.\n\n234\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.640\nSo, when Vista came out, they wanted to\ncome into compliance with the UAFI, so\n\n235\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.060\nthey had to redo their entire boot\narchitecture to be UAFI compliant.\n\n236\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.380\nSo, I'm gonna defer to the fact,\nand I want you to take this,\n\n237\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.840\nthis is your homework.\n\n238\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.548\nAll right, get in our forums too,\nif you wanna follow us up.\n\n239\n00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:34.916\nThen I'm pretty sure this is a UEFI\nbased on situation, 128 partitions.\n\n240\n00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:37.060\n&gt;&gt; Good to know [LAUGH].\n\n241\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Now, here is something that I will tell\nyou that is specific certain operating\n\n242\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.400\nsystems will only let you access to\ncertain locations within the UEFI.\n\n243\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.720\nJust, cuz you have 128 doesn't necessarily\ngive you access to all of them.\n\n244\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.600\nJust like we said in our episode where\nwe talked about some of our features,\n\n245\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.160\nthat 64 bit theoretically gives\nyou access to 65 exobytes.\n\n246\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.650\nYeah.\nBeyond terabyte, beyond petabyte,\n\n247\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.340\nwe're talking exobytes.\n\n248\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.916\nTheoretically, Windows on a client\noperating system I think it's like\n\n249\n00:13:08.916 --> 00:13:12.690\n128 [CROSSTALK] and\nthe definitely limit you on the ram.\n\n250\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.127\nYou know and you want more RAM,\n\n251\n00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.627\nyou buy a higher priced\noperating system [CROSSTALK].\n\n252\n00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:18.400\n&gt;&gt; It always comes down to the Do-Re-Mi.\n\n253\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely, it really does.\n\n254\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.968\nYou know there's-\n&gt;&gt; Gets you every time.\n\n255\n00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:24.585\n&gt;&gt; That's right, there's a reason\nthese guys are in business.\n\n256\n00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:25.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n257\n00:13:25.726 --> 00:13:26.294\n&gt;&gt; Be in business.\n\n258\n00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:27.130\n&gt;&gt; To be in business.\n\n259\n00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.250\nHey, I like the way you put that.\n\n260\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.125\nI see what you did there [LAUGH].\n\n261\n00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n262\n00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.280\none of the things that I also want you\nto know, that's one of the big things,\n\n263\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.840\nis that just understand that, you know,\nthat you don't have that limitation,\n\n264\n00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.740\nthat forward primary partition limitation.\n\n265\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.120\nThe other thing is, notice,\nthat we have a primary GTP header.\n\n266\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.830\nAnd we a secondary GPT header.\n\n267\n00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:53.538\nAll right, this is where GPT is amazing.\n\n268\n00:13:53.538 --> 00:13:58.030\nIf your primary GPT header, well,\nI'm gonna look to bootstrap, the operating\n\n269\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:04.020\nsystem is corrupt like master boot record\nwould fail and fail to boot the system.\n\n270\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.312\nGuess what a Unified Extensible\nFirmware Interface system can do?\n\n271\n00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:08.700\nWell, that's okay.\n\n272\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.110\nThe first one is corrupt.\n\n273\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.560\nI see a secondary GPT header here and\nthat is protected,\n\n274\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.830\nthat one can't get manipulated.\n\n275\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.890\nI’ll go ahead and I’ll continue to boot\nthe operating system on the one that's\n\n276\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.850\nprotected that is fully functional.\n\n277\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.140\nAnd here's where it goes even farther.\n\n278\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.290\nThe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\nplatform will rebuild\n\n279\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.950\nthe failed corrupted primary GPT Header,\nbringing it back to its original state, so\n\n280\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.470\nit's fault tolerant.\n\n281\n00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.050\nNow, why do I make mention of all of this?\n\n282\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.550\nAll right.\n\n283\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.650\nYes, for the exam, but\ndo you see these two choices here?\n\n284\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.030\nThere's more than just a radio\nbutton that you're clicking.\n\n285\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.810\nPlease understand that,\nit's not just a click of the button.\n\n286\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.410\nIt is to you, but there is a choice\nthat you make there, all right?\n\n287\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.520\nSo, do understand that.\n\n288\n00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.910\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll just do GPT, and now,\n\n289\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.685\nI'm gonna initialize these disks.\n\n290\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:06.190\nNow, when that happens, all right,\neven though we have a GPT based device,\n\n291\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:12.570\nall right, I want you to see some things\nabout the icons within device manager.\n\n292\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.540\nNotice, that we have disk one,\nwe have disk two.\n\n293\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.230\nThere is something known as a basic disk.\n\n294\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.720\nAnd there's something known\nas a dynamic disk, all right?\n\n295\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.980\nNow, here's something interesting.\n\n296\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.380\nIf you want to use more than\nfour of those partitions,\n\n297\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:34.290\nyou cannot use a basic disk, all right?\n\n298\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.770\nBasic disks, essentially fall\nunder that earlier limitation.\n\n299\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.100\nIf you want to get around that,\nyou have to right-click and\n\n300\n00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.920\nyou have to convert, it is a GPR, okay,\nyou gotta convert it to a dynamic disk.\n\n301\n00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.805\nAll right, so please keep that in mind.\n\n302\n00:15:51.805 --> 00:15:54.145\nThere we go,\ncuz I've confused me there for a second.\n\n303\n00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:55.895\nAll right, and there we go.\n\n304\n00:15:55.895 --> 00:15:58.947\nAll right.\nSo, you have to use a dynamic disk.\n\n305\n00:15:58.947 --> 00:16:04.893\nAll right, and the dynamic disk gives\nyou the ability to configure this.\n\n306\n00:16:04.893 --> 00:16:08.259\nSpanned volumes, these striped volumes-\n&gt;&gt; That's a very nice feature.\n\n307\n00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:08.991\n&gt;&gt; These mirrored volumes.\n\n308\n00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:12.890\nRight, it allows you essentially to turn\nyour computer into a software level RAID.\n\n309\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.100\nKeep in mind, software level\nRAIDs do not perform the same\n\n310\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.510\nway as a hardware controller and\na motherboard that performs RAID.\n\n311\n00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.250\nBut at least it gives you the ability and\nthe functionality to do that.\n\n312\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:28.780\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nyour basic partitioning, if you will.\n\n313\n00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.943\nAll right, now the other thing that we\ncan do is formatting, all right, well,\n\n314\n00:16:31.943 --> 00:16:32.805\nhow would we do that?\n\n315\n00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:33.958\nLet me show you here.\n\n316\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.770\nIf I right-click on any one of these\nvolumes, I create a new simple volume,\n\n317\n00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.290\nwhich mean says, we're gonna\ntake a portion of this drive or\n\n318\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.390\nthe whole drive depending\non how we wanna do it.\n\n319\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.750\nAnd were just gonna create a single\ncontiguous container, all right.\n\n320\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.564\nAnd I'm gonna new of volume.\n\n321\n00:16:49.564 --> 00:16:52.807\nNow, once I choose new volume,\nyou'll see there's this new volume wizard,\n\n322\n00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:54.083\nprovided I can get it.\n\n323\n00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:57.810\nI can get it in the screen there for\nyou, guys.\n\n324\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.976\nAll right, we've got this new\nvolume wizard, all right, and\n\n325\n00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:02.600\nwe're gonna choose Next.\n\n326\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.160\n&gt;&gt; I do love these wizards that\nMicrosoft gives you inside of\n\n327\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.960\nthe Windows Operating System, especially\nwhen it comes to this kind of stuff.\n\n328\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.633\nBecause coming from a Linux background,\nI have had to make some partitions in this\n\n329\n00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:16.982\nkind of thing before and wanted the\ncommand line can be a little bit tedious.\n\n330\n00:17:16.982 --> 00:17:20.290\nThis is a whole lot easier just to be\nable to click your way through it.\n\n331\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.828\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and\nif you're not worried about scripting,\n\n332\n00:17:22.828 --> 00:17:24.520\nthis is where your bread and butter is.\n\n333\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n334\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.000\n&gt;&gt; But, if you're in the scripting, right,\nyou need to automate some of this process,\n\n335\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.370\nthat's where the command prompt is gonna\nsave, basically save your bacon, right,\n\n336\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.455\nand it's all about food here today.\n\n337\n00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:36.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so.\n\n338\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.889\n&gt;&gt; This is a walking chicken wing.\n\n339\n00:17:37.889 --> 00:17:38.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n340\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.475\nI am a walking chicken wing,\nI resemble that remark, Dan.\n\n341\n00:17:41.475 --> 00:17:45.610\nAll right so, If we wanna make\nsome changes to this partition,\n\n342\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.840\nwhat we're gonna do in creating\nthis volume, if you will.\n\n343\n00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.910\nEssentially, what we have to do is,\nwe have to say,\n\n344\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.380\nokay, how much of this space in this\ndisk do you wanna create, right?\n\n345\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.719\nNow we could chop it in half, right?\n\n346\n00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:57.840\nHow big do we want it?\n\n347\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.230\nImagine if you popped the top off of your\nhome and you're looking down at it, and\n\n348\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.380\nyou have no walls in the house, right?\n\n349\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.300\nAs an architect, they could come in and\nthey could lay out where\n\n350\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.090\nthe walls are gonna be and\nthey could make one room smaller.\n\n351\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.300\nYou want a big room for\na master room, hey, you know what,\n\n352\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.450\nyou want a small kids room but\nyou want a big office, right?\n\n353\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.720\nHow are you gonna lay the walls\nout really divides that space up?\n\n354\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.540\nThis is what you're doing here.\n\n355\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:28.030\nHow much of this entire drive's\ncapacity do you wanna make one room?\n\n356\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.350\nOne volume, right?\n\n357\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.750\nI'm gonna go ahead and just we'll\nleave it at the defaults, Dan, here.\n\n358\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.170\nWe'll say, take the whole thing, right?\n\n359\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.026\nWe'll just do one simple volume\nacross the whole entire drive.\n\n360\n00:18:37.026 --> 00:18:39.375\nNow, here's what we also get to do.\n\n361\n00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:42.455\nAssign the following drive letter,\nall right.\n\n362\n00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:46.875\nNotice that we have a lot of options here,\nright?\n\n363\n00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:50.275\nYou're not really limited anymore and\nin fact, you could even use A and B today,\n\n364\n00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:52.482\nand you couldn't do that\nin the earlier days of DOS.\n\n365\n00:18:52.482 --> 00:18:54.840\nAnd the reason-\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot of hard drives are or\n\n366\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.830\nfloppy drives running around anymore,\nright?\n\n367\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.790\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n368\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.830\nMan, I can't fool him.\n\n369\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.670\nTrying to throw you curveballs, man,\nI gotta be a better pitcher here.\n\n370\n00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.370\nAll right, so Dan's exactly right.\n\n371\n00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.431\nIn the earlier days,\nA and B were reserved for\n\n372\n00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:10.501\nfloppy disk one and\nfloppy disk two, right?\n\n373\n00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:12.530\nWhat you said, well, wait a second.\n\n374\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.210\nWhere's C?\n\n375\n00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.700\nWell Windows would default to the C volume\nand the optical drive would be D, right?\n\n376\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.160\nSo, that's not really a case anymore.\n\n377\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.000\nSo we don't have to worry about\nthat limitation, all right.\n\n378\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.190\nWe're gonna go to, I don't know.\n\n379\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.502\nI'm thinking of X-Men, so\nwe're gonna do X for the drive here and\n\n380\n00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.720\nwe're gonna choose Next.\n\n381\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.020\nAll right now, bio systems,\nI got two choices here.\n\n382\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.905\nWe choose the down arrow,\nwe have two choices.\n\n383\n00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:44.490\n[LAUGH] All right,\nI said we got choices, two.\n\n384\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.638\nWe have FAT32, we have NTFS.\n\n385\n00:19:46.638 --> 00:19:50.372\nI'm gonna comeback and I'm gonna talk\nabout some other file systems that\n\n386\n00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:54.780\nyou wanted to know about but, all right,\nreal quick, FAT32 has some limitations.\n\n387\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.370\nFirst of all, it has no security, we\ndon't get ACLs, we don't get permission.\n\n388\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.212\n&gt;&gt; It just doesn't believe in itself,\nthat's it's problem, it's limitations.\n\n389\n00:20:04.212 --> 00:20:06.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's certainly the case.\n\n390\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.890\nFAT32 also has a file size limitation.\n\n391\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.180\nI think it's a 4 gig file,\nis the biggest file size that you can get.\n\n392\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.760\nSo, you typically don't\nwanna convert FAT32, or\n\n393\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.800\nformat to FAT32 because of this fact.\n\n394\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.580\nBecause of the fact, and\nlet me kind of go ahead and re-state that.\n\n395\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.697\nYou might use FAT32.\n\n396\n00:20:25.697 --> 00:20:28.645\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nif you have to go through,\n\n397\n00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:32.062\nbetween other operating systems\nthat don't support NTFS,\n\n398\n00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:36.330\nthat is really what I meant to say,\nyou might have to use FAT32.\n\n399\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.120\nHowever, if you're in Windows,\nand you're using Windows systems,\n\n400\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.950\nyou benefit from using NTFS, because you\nget around the 4 gigabyte limitation.\n\n401\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.888\nYou also have the ability\nto put permissions,\n\n402\n00:20:47.888 --> 00:20:52.043\nwhich we'll talk about NTFS\npermissions in security coming up.\n\n403\n00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:55.320\nBut you also get the ability to\ndo encryption and compression.\n\n404\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.660\nEncryption through EFS,\nEncrypting File System.\n\n405\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.048\nCompression being able to\nsave the space on the drive.\n\n406\n00:21:00.048 --> 00:21:03.280\nNow notice that we have a format option.\n\n407\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.632\nAll right, in our format option,\nthere are two types of,\n\n408\n00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:09.020\nwell really in hard drives there's\ntwo types of formats that you can do.\n\n409\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.040\nYou can do what's known\nas a low level format.\n\n410\n00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.610\nYou can do what's known as a high level or\nstandard format.\n\n411\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.740\nWhat we're doing here is a high\nlevel standard format and\n\n412\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.170\nthat means the operating system,\n\n413\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.420\nthe software, if you will,\nis configuring the file system, right?\n\n414\n00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.270\nIt's gonna erase the drive and\napply that logical structure to the drive,\n\n415\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:31.110\nthe file system, so that you can start\nusing it in saving files and folders.\n\n416\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.610\nLow level formatting is something that\nis done by the hardware manufacturer,\n\n417\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.930\nthat's not something that we see.\n\n418\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.400\nThey do that at the factory at the time\nthat they're creating the drives, right.\n\n419\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.940\nIf you use NTFS, you get file and\nfolder compression.\n\n420\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.373\nNotice when I changed to do a FAT32,\ndid you see that gray out there now?\n\n421\n00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:49.047\n&gt;&gt; It went away.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it went away so\n\n422\n00:21:49.047 --> 00:21:50.050\nwe can do that too.\n\n423\n00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:55.676\nNow, I'm not a real big fan of volume\nlabels because it's already got a letter,\n\n424\n00:21:55.676 --> 00:22:01.080\nso I kinda take that out there, but you\ncan put a volume label on it if you want.\n\n425\n00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.620\nThat's up to you, that's kind of\nmy little thing there that I do.\n\n426\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.800\nBut we'll go ahead, and we'll format it.\n\n427\n00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.280\nRemember your review screen?\n\n428\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.440\nThis is the time, if you wanna make\nchanges, that you could back up and\n\n429\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.200\nyou can change them.\n\n430\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.725\nIf not, go ahead and choose Finish.\n\n431\n00:22:14.725 --> 00:22:21.880\nAnd we've now applied that\nstructure to the hard drive itself.\n\n432\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.685\nNow Dan, you had mentioned something.\n\n433\n00:22:22.685 --> 00:22:26.300\nYou said something earlier, and I think\nyou're giving me that look over there.\n\n434\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.305\nI think you got some information for me.\n\n435\n00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was like a splinter in my\nmind, right, and I couldn't let it go.\n\n436\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.538\nIt was about the GPT, and\n\n437\n00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:38.852\nI was sure that there was nearly\nunlimited partitioning available to it.\n\n438\n00:22:38.852 --> 00:22:41.920\nAnd it was only limited\nby the operating system.\n\n439\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.704\nI did look it up, that is correct.\n\n440\n00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:45.524\nYou are limited only by\nyour operating system,\n\n441\n00:22:45.524 --> 00:22:48.495\nwhich Windows does define\nas 128 partitions.\n\n442\n00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:51.315\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there you go.\n\n443\n00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:53.309\nA great information, cuz we wanna\nmake sure that we get it right.-\n\n444\n00:22:53.309 --> 00:22:55.485\n&gt;&gt; You can thank the Interwebs.\n\n445\n00:22:55.485 --> 00:22:56.398\n&gt;&gt; The Interwebs.\n\n446\n00:22:56.398 --> 00:22:57.515\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:22:57.515 --> 00:22:58.997\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so there you go.\n\n448\n00:22:58.997 --> 00:23:00.725\nGPT is only limited by, well,\n\n449\n00:23:00.725 --> 00:23:04.185\nwhatever the operating system\nis that you're putting on it.\n\n450\n00:23:04.185 --> 00:23:08.818\nAnd I'm sure that means its you want more,\nyou pay more, right?\n\n451\n00:23:08.818 --> 00:23:09.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:23:09.318 --> 00:23:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whatever, yeah.\n\n453\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Last little thing that\nwe just wanna talk about.\n\n454\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.130\nWe mentioned the fact that\nyou can also manage and\n\n455\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.680\nmaintain your partitions with\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n456\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.604\nSo let me go ahead and,\n\n457\n00:23:18.604 --> 00:23:21.098\nwe've already shown you that\none with the command prompts.\n\n458\n00:23:21.098 --> 00:23:22.163\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n459\n00:23:22.163 --> 00:23:26.440\njust show you real quick by dropping down\nto our administrative command prompt.\n\n460\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.212\nAnd we'll say Yes to the UAC and\nyou know guys,\n\n461\n00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:32.140\nI should have had this\nconfigured ahead of time.\n\n462\n00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:37.440\nI do apologize out there for all of you,\ngirls and guys out there watching.\n\n463\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.530\nLet me go ahead and\njust kinda manipulate this a little bit,\n\n464\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.620\nmake it a little easier.\n\n465\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.415\nThere we go for you, guys.\n&gt;&gt; Again,\n\n466\n00:23:41.415 --> 00:23:45.180\nanother thing that I wish that Windows\nwould follow of the Linux operating\n\n467\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.260\nsystem, where you can just do control.\n\n468\n00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.954\n&gt;&gt; Control plus?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, control plus.\n\n469\n00:23:48.954 --> 00:23:50.840\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n&gt;&gt; Data increases.\n\n470\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.574\n&gt;&gt; That must be so nice.\n\n471\n00:23:51.574 --> 00:23:52.431\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n472\n00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:55.274\nAll right, so if I enter into DiskPart,\n\n473\n00:23:55.274 --> 00:24:00.223\nthis gives me the ability to see\nthings like the disks we just created.\n\n474\n00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:03.880\nNotice that I can see the disk,\nI can see what size it is.\n\n475\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:10.312\nIf it's a dynamic disk versus\na basic disk, if it's got a GPT.\n\n476\n00:24:10.312 --> 00:24:16.446\nNotice that the first disk does not have\nthe GPT or the asterisk symbol in the GPT.\n\n477\n00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:18.057\nThat lets me know it's not GPT.\n\n478\n00:24:18.057 --> 00:24:21.880\nThe only other option is master\nboot record, so know that.\n\n479\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.060\nSome of the other things, and\nI'll go ahead and exit out of this,\n\n480\n00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.040\njust keep that in mind.\n\n481\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.670\nSome of the other things you have for\ndisk maintenance.\n\n482\n00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.860\nYou have things like the check\ndisk command, that checks\n\n483\n00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.487\nthe logical integrity of the file\nsystem and could potentially fix files.\n\n484\n00:24:36.487 --> 00:24:38.965\nThat is, there are two options in here.\n\n485\n00:24:38.965 --> 00:24:40.695\nI'll just use our /?.\n\n486\n00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:48.195\nI want you know /F and /R and\nif you do run your /?, you'll see that\n\n487\n00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:52.440\n/F fixes the errors on the disk and /R\ndoes something that's kinda interesting.\n\n488\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.330\nIt locates the bad sectors and\nif it finds data that it can recover\n\n489\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.500\nfrom those bad sectors, it'll move it\nto another location on the disk and\n\n490\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.010\nit will mark those sectors as bad.\n\n491\n00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.660\nSo if you run /R you're\nalso running /F as well.\n\n492\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.650\nGreat little thing to have.\n\n493\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.190\nThe other thing, and I'm gonna kinda,\n\n494\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:13.233\nlet me see if I can open up a new\ncommand prompt here, and there we go.\n\n495\n00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:16.270\nCuz I wanna run this one in the background\nhere because this one will take a second.\n\n496\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.200\nYou also have sfc,\ncuz you have system files and folders.\n\n497\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.480\nThese are the crucial folders and\nfiles that the operating system needs to\n\n498\n00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.240\nfunction, and if they get corrupted,\nthey cause problems.\n\n499\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.640\nSo sfc is the System File Checker.\n\n500\n00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.801\nAnd what you could do is run sfc/scannow.\n\n501\n00:25:34.801 --> 00:25:38.830\nAnd what that'll do is it\nwill scan those system files.\n\n502\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:44.430\nBe careful on the exam,\ncuz chkdsk checks all the files.\n\n503\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.250\nIt checks for bad sectors on the drive,\ntries to recover that information.\n\n504\n00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.910\nSystem File Checker is only\nchecking your system files.\n\n505\n00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.183\nAnd that's why I went ahead and\nopened another command prompt here,\n\n506\n00:25:55.183 --> 00:25:57.338\ncuz you can see that\nit'll take a little bit.\n\n507\n00:25:57.338 --> 00:26:00.197\nCouple of the other\nthings that we have too,\n\n508\n00:26:00.197 --> 00:26:03.840\nyou also have the ability to\ndo defragging, all right?\n\n509\n00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.751\nIf I can type defrag, I remember de-\n&gt;&gt; Decrag.\n\n510\n00:26:07.751 --> 00:26:08.565\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\nDe-kraken.\n\n511\n00:26:08.565 --> 00:26:09.419\nRelease the kraken.\n\n512\n00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:11.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, release the kraken.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:26:11.162 --> 00:26:13.275\n&gt;&gt; Defrag.exe and this one also,\n\n514\n00:26:13.275 --> 00:26:16.020\nyou know you've got some options there.\n\n515\n00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.450\nYou can do analyzations.\n\n516\n00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:22.571\nYou can /U, if you will, shows you\nthe progress of the operation, too.\n\n517\n00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:24.260\nI can't remember what analyze is.\n\n518\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.220\nIs it as simple as A?\n\n519\n00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.080\nYeah, okay, so let me see if I can\nshow you this as well real quick.\n\n520\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.740\nAnd we'll let it\n\n521\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.020\nrun in the background here as we\ntalk about some of the other ones.\n\n522\n00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:39.565\nSo I can do a defrag /u to show me\nthe output, /a for analyzation.\n\n523\n00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:41.917\nI believe if I do C: it's gonna start,\n\n524\n00:26:41.917 --> 00:26:45.136\nand it will start running\nits progress as well, too.\n\n525\n00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:48.751\nNow it might bog down a little bit,\ncuz I've got a couple of these programs\n\n526\n00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:52.564\nrunning right now and System File Checker\ncan kinda get a little bit verbose.\n\n527\n00:26:52.564 --> 00:26:57.670\nBut again, allowing you the ability to do\ndisk defragmentation, and there it goes.\n\n528\n00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.880\nIt's kind of analyzing in the background.\n\n529\n00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.230\nGreat utilities to have,\ngood stuff to have for disk maintenance.\n\n530\n00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.210\nI'll go ahead and\nclose these down here cuz I do know,\n\n531\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.860\nI see we're coming up on time.\n\n532\n00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.285\nJust a last couple of things there, Dan.\n\n533\n00:27:11.285 --> 00:27:13.440\nWe've kind of mentioned disk defragmenter.\n\n534\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.270\nI do wanna mention that if you\nright-click on your Start button,\n\n535\n00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.330\nyou go to Control Panel.\n\n536\n00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.880\nActually, there's a couple of\nways that you can do this.\n\n537\n00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.210\nLet me show you one of the easiest ways.\n\n538\n00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.290\nOpen up File Explorer.\n\n539\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.870\nYou could also do this\nwith Windows Explorer,\n\n540\n00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.670\nif you're in earlier operating systems.\n\n541\n00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.990\nAnd if you select and right-click the hard\ndrive that you wanna do maintenance on,\n\n542\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.140\nyou could choose Properties.\n\n543\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.860\nAnd from the Tools option,\nyou've got two additional things.\n\n544\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.270\nThere's your check disk through\na graphical user interface.\n\n545\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.000\nYou have the disk\ndefragmenter as well there.\n\n546\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.360\nThey call it the drive optimizer,\noptimize your drives today.\n\n547\n00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.270\nBut from the General tab, too,\nyou also have Disk Cleanup.\n\n548\n00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.390\nAnd Disk Cleanup would allow you to check\nthings like some of the temporary files\n\n549\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.780\nthat can accumulate on our drives, things\nlike temporary Internet files as well.\n\n550\n00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.270\nDoes look like it's\nrunning in the background,\n\n551\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.330\nand you could potentially remove those,\ntoo.\n\n552\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.290\nSo a lot of good things to keep in mind.\n\n553\n00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:10.120\nThere's just a couple other file systems\nI wanna talk about that you could see.\n\n554\n00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.890\nAnd I don't know if you will\nsee them on the exam or not.\n\n555\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.270\nThey have exFAT.\n\n556\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.890\nexFAT was invented by Microsoft.\n\n557\n00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.680\nAnd it does, and you can see,\ncheck Disk Cleanup just says hey,\n\n558\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.790\nwhich one of these do you wanna remove?\n\n559\n00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:26.620\nexFAT allows you to move files in between\nMac operating systems and Windows.\n\n560\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.411\nSo if you format a drive or\n\n561\n00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:32.560\nan external drive with that, that's\nwhat it allows you the ability to do.\n\n562\n00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.860\nThere are a couple of other ones too,\nCDFS and UDF.\n\n563\n00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.430\nCDFS is an older one,\nwe really don't use it much anymore.\n\n564\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.260\nThat's compact disc file system, it was\nfor audio and data in the earlier days.\n\n565\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.360\nToday what we use pretty much for\nDVDs and Blu-Ray is something called UDF.\n\n566\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.420\nThat's the universal disk format, and\n\n567\n00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.655\nit is the more common one that you might\nsee on your optical media drives today.\n\n568\n00:28:53.655 --> 00:28:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, great look,\na quick and dirty look\n\n569\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.020\nat the disk management inside of Windows\noperating system, very cool stuff.\n\n570\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.610\nDefinitely something that you should be\nfamiliar with as you enter that A plus\n\n571\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.660\nexam booth.\n\n572\n00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.760\nWes, thanks for joining us today.\n\n573\n00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.880\nWe appreciate you dropping by and\ndropping knowledge bombs on us.\n\n574\n00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.320\nYou never know, maybe some of those\nactually stuck in the old noggin, right?\n\n575\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.240\nI hope some did in mine.\n\n576\n00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.382\nBut I'm looking at our clock, and\nlike you've said, we're out of time.\n\n577\n00:29:17.382 --> 00:29:18.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n578\n00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.310\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n579\n00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.940\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n580\n00:29:21.940 -->

live,\n\n3\n00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:06.448\nfrom San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:07.863\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.863 --> 00:00:11.972\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:13.926\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:16.710\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.470\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and in todays\nepisode we'll strap in because guess what,\n\n9\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.680\nwe're back With our A+ accelerated course.\n\n10\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.450\nAnd it is that very much that we\nare trying to push the pedal down,\n\n11\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.910\nand give you just the information that\nyou need so that you can pass that exam.\n\n12\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.020\nAnd, Wes is joining us\ntoday back in the studio.\n\n13\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.615\nWes, how are you doing today and\nglad to have you.\n\n14\n00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:36.345\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I appreciate having me here,\n\n15\n00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:37.610\nhat's great to be here again.\n\n16\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.155\nAnd it's been a really fun episode.\n\n17\n00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:40.359\n&gt;&gt; It has been.\n&gt;&gt; It's been a [INAUDIBLE] series.\n\n18\n00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:41.783\nWe'll see if it's a fun episode.\n\n19\n00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:42.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll let\n\n20\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.360\nyou be the judge by the end of that but,\nbeen a real fun series here.\n\n21\n00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.350\nAnd keep in mind as we move\nthrough our accelerated A+ course,\n\n22\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.110\nthat some of the information\nthat we are throwing at you,\n\n23\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.590\nis going to have a certain\nlevel of assumed knowledge.\n\n24\n00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.850\nDan said it back in the beginning when\nwe first started this journey, and\n\n25\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.170\nit does stay true as we move through.\n\n26\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.980\nHowever, keep in mind that we want you\nto know that if you want a little bit\n\n27\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.550\nmore in-depth of some of the explanations,\nby all means check out our 901,\n\n28\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.850\n902 series that are separated\ninto two different exams.\n\n29\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.886\nJust like you'll see here when you go out\nand you try for your A+ certification.\n\n30\n00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:20.655\nSo we're gonna be looking at two\nvery popular concepts and really,\n\n31\n00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:25.522\nyou can have each one of these\nconcepts without having the other one.\n\n32\n00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:30.194\nBut you will see today more often then not\nthat both of these concepts that we're\n\n33\n00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:33.542\ngonna talk about,\nthey really compliment each other and\n\n34\n00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:37.380\nthey are used a lot pretty much\nall in the same ball park.\n\n35\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.160\nWe're talking about things\nlike virtualization,\n\n36\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.610\nwe're talking about Cloud\nbased concepts too.\n\n37\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.380\nNow please understand that they don't\nnecessarily have to go together, right?\n\n38\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.610\nThey do a lot today.\n\n39\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.810\nAnd what I mean by that is,\n\n40\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.950\nthere are certain Cloud offerings that you\nprobably been using for a very long time.\n\n41\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.570\nThat doesn't necessarily means that within\nyour network you were using virtualization\n\n42\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.000\nor vice versa,\nmay be in the use of virtualization for\n\n43\n00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.990\na while but your company hasn't\nbeen using Cloud based concepts.\n\n44\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.350\nSo they are two separate concepts but\ntoday, with such major\n\n45\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.390\nplayers out there like Microsoft,\nAmazon, AWUS if you will.\n\n46\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.950\nYou're really seeing that each one of\nthis really do complement one another.\n\n47\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're totally right Wes and\nit seems like,\n\n48\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.070\nbecause of the buzzworthiness\nof things like Cloud, right?\n\n49\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.740\nThat they're trying to make them\nmore connected than they once were.\n\n50\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.050\nAs far as this exam goes, there's\nprobably still has that disconnect, but\n\n51\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.880\nthey're starting to call\nvirtualization at your house or\n\n52\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.660\nat your business On-Prem Private Cloud.\n\n53\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.330\nBecause it's On Premises and\nit's a Private Cloud,\n\n54\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.855\nmeans nobody else has access to it,\nright, it's just you.\n\n55\n00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:51.255\nBecause they like that, that Cloud term\nis just making IT managers all a tizzied,\n\n56\n00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:52.204\nthey love it so much.\n\n57\n00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.141\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\n\n58\n00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.295\nthey know that somebody's ready.\n\n59\n00:02:54.295 --> 00:02:55.225\nI got my wallet out.\n\n60\n00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:56.285\nYou said Cloud.\n\n61\n00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:57.497\nWhich products do you have?\n\n62\n00:02:57.497 --> 00:02:58.999\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n63\n00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.545\nBut there are some things that\nyou wanna know under the hood.\n\n64\n00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:04.925\nNow you'll hear that Dan\nmentioned Private Cloud.\n\n65\n00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:05.975\nWe're gonna come back to those,\n\n66\n00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:09.330\ncuz there's a few different models\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n67\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.430\nWe need to know what On-Prem even means,\n\n68\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.510\nwhat is it short for,\nwhere would we find it, right?\n\n69\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.450\nWhat the pros and\ncons of implementing something like that.\n\n70\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.765\nAnd just like any other\npiece of technology,\n\n71\n00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:25.000\nthere's good stuff that goes along with\nit, there is certain considerations that\n\n72\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.130\ncan also lead to some of the bad things\nthat might, what you might face.\n\n73\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.250\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into virtualization first.\n\n74\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.380\nAnd then we'll get into\nCloud concepts next.\n\n75\n00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.485\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, really quickly,\nwhat is virtualization?\n\n76\n00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:37.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Virtualization, that's great.\n\n77\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.940\nSo I want you to think about,\n\n78\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.299\nlet's go ahead and\nthrow virtualization out of your mind.\n\n79\n00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.680\nNo, okay, you can better understand\nwhat virtualization is just getting but\n\n80\n00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.010\nI want you to think about, maybe you're\nrunning a work station at home, right now.\n\n81\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.810\nLet's say that you've taken that work\nstation and you've been Beefed it up, and\n\n82\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.530\nwhat I mean by that jargon aside is that\nyou put a lot of processing power in it.\n\n83\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.020\nYou got a lot of hard drive space.\n\n84\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.000\nYou got a lot of memory in there.\n\n85\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.030\nMaybe we got up to 32 I've even seen 64,\n96 gigs of RAM in some systems today.\n\n86\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.520\nBut you've got a lot more resources than\nyou had, maybe just even 10 years ago.\n\n87\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.050\nYou put an operating system on it,\nand now what do you have?\n\n88\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.120\nYou have one operating system on it,\n\n89\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.330\nnow is controlling all of that CPU power,\nall of that RAM and\n\n90\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.040\none operating system that is basically\ncontrolling the entirety of your storage.\n\n91\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.230\nMaybe a little differently and you say\nall right, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.090\nwe're gonna do a multi-boot.\n\n93\n00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.650\nI'm gonna install, I'm gonna partition\nthe storage space right down the middle,\n\n94\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.120\nI'm gonna give half of it to Windows,\n\n95\n00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.700\nI'll give half of it to,\nI'll let your favorite Linux distribution.\n\n96\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.640\nSo great,\nnow you got two operating systems.\n\n97\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.770\nBut I want you to think about how\nthe operating systems are gonna run.\n\n98\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.540\nWhen I start the computer up right,\none of those operating system's\n\n99\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.630\ngonna take control of the hard drive,\nwhich means we're still\n\n100\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.240\nback to the same predicament that we were,\neven with just a single operating system.\n\n101\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.900\nOne operating system is\ncontrolling all the CPU power,\n\n102\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.240\nis controlling all of the RAM.\n\n103\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.001\nThe exception might be on the Linux box,\nis the fact that it's true multi-user and\n\n104\n00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:10.726\nthe fact that you could have more than one\nperson connected to it simultaneously.\n\n105\n00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:12.715\nThat's one of the benefits\nof UNIX based systems.\n\n106\n00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:16.210\nBut however, you still want to\nhave a single operating system.\n\n107\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.850\nWouldn't it be nice to be able\nto take all of that power, and\n\n108\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.780\ndivide it up between\nmultiple operating systems.\n\n109\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.130\nAnd each one of these multiple operating\nsystems, are now their own self-contained\n\n110\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.550\nunit that's running simultaneously,\non the same physical hardware.\n\n111\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.820\nAnd I don't have to shut one down,\nwait till it does a graceful shutdown\n\n112\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.110\nto turn around and turn the other one back\non, in a multi [INAUDIBLE] situation.\n\n113\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.670\nSo one of the things that virtualization\nfirst and foremost does, is it allows you\n\n114\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.130\nto run multiple operating systems on\na single piece of hardware simultaneously.\n\n115\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.002\nNow again Linux has been close to that.\n\n116\n00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:59.330\nUNIX systems are close to it\nwithout the virtualization,\n\n117\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.700\nbecause they're true multi user platforms,\narchitecture.\n\n118\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.590\nAnd what I mean by that, if you guys are\ncoming from the Windows world, you say,\n\n119\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.720\nwell I got more than one user\non my computer at home and\n\n120\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.710\nI'm not running UNIX or Linux.\n\n121\n00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.960\nCareful with that because you\nstill have to log out one user and\n\n122\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.770\nlog another user in, so\ntechnically only one user is\n\n123\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.282\nlogged in to the machine at the same time,\ncontrolling the desktop.\n\n124\n00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:24.960\n&gt;&gt; So by multi user, you don't mean\nthat there are more than one user that's\n\n125\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.710\naccessing the system,\nit's more than one user at one time.\n\n126\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.460\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n127\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.671\nAnd that's exactly what that is.\n\n128\n00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:33.520\nIt's a true active multi-user.\n\n129\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.750\nAnd that's what NIX system is.\n\n130\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.710\nBut this is more than that.\n\n131\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.650\nThis means I have Windows running.\n\n132\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.500\nI have, let's say for whatever reason,\nI've got Windows 7 running,\n\n133\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.180\nWindows 8,\nWindows 8.1 all on the same machine.\n\n134\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.890\nNow you're preparing for your A+ exam.\n\n135\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.170\nYou decide, you know what?\n\n136\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.019\nI see on the A+ exam there's gonna be\na little bit of Linux thrown in there, so\n\n137\n00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:54.098\nI gotta study Linux.\n\n138\n00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:57.200\nWell you don't have to re-install Linux\nand then wipe out all your machines,\n\n139\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.738\ncuz you just go ahead and\ndivide some of the other resources up and\n\n140\n00:06:59.738 --> 00:07:01.254\nyou install Linux just draw on there.\n\n141\n00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.519\nAnd now, you are running four\noperating systems on a single station\n\n142\n00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.440\nsimultaneously.\n\n143\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.980\nBut we can go even further than that.\n\n144\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.200\nWe can go even further than that, because\nthat's just more of your home environment.\n\n145\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.840\nImagine a server, a server where it could\nhave a 64 gigs of RAM, could have multiple\n\n146\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.417\nprocessors, and multiple storage could\nbe attached to a send-based like system,\n\n147\n00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:24.074\nif you will,\nwhere it's storage area network.\n\n148\n00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:28.124\nAnd now and traditionally without it,\nif you will, without virtualization,\n\n149\n00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:32.235\nwith one operating system and rarely\nwithin operating system with the exception\n\n150\n00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:35.453\nof some kind of services like databases,\nand stuff like that.\n\n151\n00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:39.933\nWould you really be utilizing\nthe entire power of that machine?\n\n152\n00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:43.871\nBut if we can do the virtualization,\nwhat we can do is that an extra layer\n\n153\n00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:47.812\nabstractly in between there that\nallows more than one operating system\n\n154\n00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:52.606\nto run simultaneously, and basically serve\nout multiple roles within your network,\n\n155\n00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:54.530\nall on the same physical machine.\n\n156\n00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.036\nThat's one of the great\nthings about virtualization,\n\n157\n00:07:57.036 --> 00:07:59.070\nrunning more than one\nOS on a single machine.\n\n158\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.468\nRight?\nBetter resource allocation.\n\n159\n00:08:01.468 --> 00:08:03.940\nThings like, application coexistence.\n\n160\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.882\nThis is something that's great.\n\n161\n00:08:04.882 --> 00:08:09.715\nCan you imagine Dan, trying to run the\nsame application in different versions,\n\n162\n00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:10.660\nright?\n\n163\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.930\nThat's one of the things I think of, so\nimagine that you work for a company and\n\n164\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.970\nlet's say whatever the application\nmight be, you're in version four.\n\n165\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.650\nYou've been using it for\na while, it's stable but\n\n166\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.130\nyour licence is coming to the end, and\n\n167\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.430\nyou need to consider maybe moving to\nanother line of business software.\n\n168\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.430\nBut you gotta do a little bit of testing,\nall right?\n\n169\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.560\nBut you wanna see side by\nside how they function.\n\n170\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.310\nThink about what an application\ndoes when you update it.\n\n171\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.670\nWhen I install the new\napplication over the old one,\n\n172\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.320\na lot of times what happens is\nthe older one gets erased, right?\n\n173\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.510\nWe upgrade to the new one.\n\n174\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.390\nWell that doesn't help me with my\nside by side or I could get two\n\n175\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.810\nphysical machines and waste resources,\nand kinda do a side-by-side comparison.\n\n176\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.810\nOr I could waste my time,\ntest the first one out,\n\n177\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.180\nuninstall it, install the new one,\nand then test that out.\n\n178\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.080\nWouldn't it be nice to have two\noperating systems running on the same\n\n179\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.590\nphysical device and\nrun them side by side and\n\n180\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.820\nyou can benchmark them right\nthere on the same machine?\n\n181\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.460\n&gt;&gt; Seems a whole lot more efficient.\n\n182\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n183\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.000\nAnd speaking efficient,\nthat's another thing.\n\n184\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.855\nBetter utilization of\nthe resources you have.\n\n185\n00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:13.620\nAnd think about it, I don't have to\nhave ten monitors up on my desk.\n\n186\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.410\nTen work stations up on my desk.\n\n187\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.630\nTen power adapters all\npulling power out of\n\n188\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.690\nten different electrical outlets, right?\n\n189\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:25.480\nOne machine plugged in allows me the same\nthing all isolated into a single system.\n\n190\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.930\nIt's one of the beauties\nof virtualization, right?\n\n191\n00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.310\nTesting application coexistence.\n\n192\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.195\nDan, you do a,\nI'm gonna rat Dan out here, right?\n\n193\n00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:35.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dan puts the white hat on, but\n\n194\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.600\nsometimes he puts the black hat on, too.\n\n195\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.240\nHere's another great thing\nabout virtualization, right?\n\n196\n00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.980\nIn order to catch the thief, sometimes you\nhave to use the tools that hackers use,\n\n197\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.540\nright, to attack a system and\nsee what it does.\n\n198\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.180\nWell we don't wanna unleash something on\nour network and then bring it down, right?\n\n199\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.727\nWell we might.\n\n200\n00:09:51.727 --> 00:09:52.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But we're not gonna let it do\n\n201\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.660\nthat, right?\n\n202\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.530\nBut he can sit there and\nhe can spin up a virtual machine\n\n203\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.110\ncompletely isolated from\nthe rest of the network.\n\n204\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.390\nHis own host machine, load up one\nof these nasty little viruses and\n\n205\n00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.510\nsee what it does to the operating system,\nand it doesn't affect his machine or\n\n206\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.880\nanybody else's machine out there.\n\n207\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.870\nSo it's great for testing because\nyou get that thorough isolation.\n\n208\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even if you're not\nspeaking about the things like,\n\n209\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.080\nnasty things out there like viruses,\nmalware, things of those sorts.\n\n210\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.060\nWhat if you just wanna see,\nis my environment secure?\n\n211\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.730\nI don't want to start hammering down the\nfront door of my production environment.\n\n212\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.380\nWhat if I just spin up a clone\nof that environment and\n\n213\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.560\nset up a virtual environment?\n\n214\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.200\nThat way I can do whatever I want,\nhammer away and\n\n215\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.950\ndon't worry about it because people\naren't actually contacting it.\n\n216\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.800\nBut it's a perfect representation of\nmy actual production environment.\n\n217\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.882\nSo now I can test,\nI can see am I gonna have a problem.\n\n218\n00:10:43.882 --> 00:10:48.120\nI can hammer down no problem\nNMAP scans full throttle, right?\n\n219\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.050\nDoing all sorts of crazy hacker techniques\nthat could bring a network to its knees.\n\n220\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.500\nIt doesn't matter because I'm isolated,\nI've kept that away from production.\n\n221\n00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.845\nSo it's a very nice thing for that.\n\n222\n00:10:57.845 --> 00:11:00.994\n&gt;&gt; And I'd like to go ahead and piggy back\noff of you, so spin up a virtual machine,\n\n223\n00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.680\nthere's another thing.\n\n224\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.703\nHow long would it take you to install\nan operating system, pull all the updates,\n\n225\n00:11:06.703 --> 00:11:10.254\nfind the applications that you need,\ninstall them, update that, and\n\n226\n00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:12.500\nbuild the environment?\n\n227\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.460\nWell, for some of you,\nmaybe you've done it for a while and\n\n228\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.460\nyou can do it within a couple of hours,\nright?\n\n229\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.910\nUpdates usually take the longest really,\nout of anything,\n\n230\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.960\noperating systems install quickly.\n\n231\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.020\nBut what if you already got\na Virtual Machine, all of that done and\n\n232\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.620\nyou take it and you copy the file.\n\n233\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.900\nI just made another computer.\n\n234\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.250\nIt's a software representation\nof a physical device.\n\n235\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.500\nBut all I had to do is\nmove the folder down and\n\n236\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.410\nnow I've got another operating system.\n\n237\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.150\nAnd I make a clone of it and\nI got another one.\n\n238\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.040\nThen even more so is what I can do is I\ncan create what's known as a snapshot.\n\n239\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.100\nSo if you're like Wes and\n\n240\n00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.215\nbreak everything IT-\n\n241\n00:11:45.215 --> 00:11:46.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah hush Dan.\n\n242\n00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:48.190\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] strikes again.\n\n243\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.000\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n\n244\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.580\n&gt;&gt; You could turn around and let's say you\ndo bring down the test network, right?\n\n245\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.710\nLike you were saying, I don't wanna\nbring down the production network.\n\n246\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.290\nBut I mess up the test environment.\n\n247\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.120\nWell that's okay because I can roll it\nback to an earlier point in time and\n\n248\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.280\nit's like nothing happened, so\nit's a great thing to have.\n\n249\n00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.010\nLet me show you kinda abstractly here,\ndiagram that I have, right?\n\n250\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.450\nSo here's a non-virtualization\nenvironment, right?\n\n251\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.330\nWe've got our hardware down there\nat the bottom layer, right?\n\n252\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.760\nThen what happens, right, we put\nan operating system on top of that, right?\n\n253\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.730\nAnd then what we do is\nwe put applications and\n\n254\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.814\nthey communicate with\nthe operating system.\n\n255\n00:12:19.814 --> 00:12:23.805\nThe operating system kind of like\na multi-tasker, allows you through\n\n256\n00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:28.250\nit access to the resources or\nthe hardware you have below it, right?\n\n257\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.730\nWell, with virtualization what you do\nis you actually add an extra layer and\n\n258\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.830\nthat layer is called a hypervisor,\nall right?\n\n259\n00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.200\nAnd I'm gonna talk about, there's a couple\nof different types of hypervisors, right?\n\n260\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.510\nThe first one that I was talking about\nis one where we do this on our computer.\n\n261\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.850\nI'm gonna go right to that one here.\n\n262\n00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.490\nAll right, this is what's known\nas a type two hypervisor and\n\n263\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.690\nI'll tell you why here in a second.\n\n264\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.858\nBut now I've got pretty\nmuch the same thing, right?\n\n265\n00:12:48.858 --> 00:12:51.110\nWell, I've got my hardware here.\n\n266\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.525\nI've got a host operating system.\n\n267\n00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:55.380\nWe'll tell you why we call\nit a host operating system.\n\n268\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.542\nBut then I put an hypervisor here and\nnow within and\n\n269\n00:12:58.542 --> 00:13:03.282\non top of the hypervisor, which is\nbasically the middleman, if you will,\n\n270\n00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:08.262\nthe proxy between these virtualized\noperating systems or virtual machines.\n\n271\n00:13:08.262 --> 00:13:12.358\nAnd it allows me to talk with the main\noperating system which allows me to talk\n\n272\n00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.100\nto the hardware.\n\n273\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.710\nNow this is a type two hypervisor.\n\n274\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.670\nWe have to be careful with this one\nbecause a type two hypervisor kinda\n\n275\n00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.180\nruns like all your other applications,\nright?\n\n276\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.360\nSo if I have Chrome open,\nall right, and in fact,\n\n277\n00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.940\nlet me go ahead and\nI'll minimize this, all right?\n\n278\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.120\nWell actually, I won't,\nI'll leave my diagram up here.\n\n279\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.360\nAnd now I'm gonna bring up the hypervisor,\nthe virtualization software.\n\n280\n00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.216\nNotice that it's just another piece\nof software on my computer, right?\n\n281\n00:13:39.216 --> 00:13:44.106\nType two hypervisors they take\na little bit of a performance hit.\n\n282\n00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:48.064\nAnd what I mean by that is they're running\nlike an application on your operating\n\n283\n00:13:48.064 --> 00:13:50.310\nsystem, this happens to be Mac.\n\n284\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.420\nAnd because of that, they're in\ncompetition with other applications.\n\n285\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.800\nSo what you would run inside\nof a server environment,\n\n286\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.550\ninside of an enterprise environment,\none that we call a type one hypervisor.\n\n287\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.240\nAnd this is actually what you would\nsee more in a corporate environment.\n\n288\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.440\nConcept is close to the same thing.\n\n289\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.120\nI mean it's a hypervisor.\n\n290\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.389\nOn top of that hypervisor you have\noperating systems that are now run.\n\n291\n00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:16.570\nAnd just like your operating system that\nyou're probably watching us with here if\n\n292\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.230\nyou happen to be, let's say, on your\nworkstation, you can run applications.\n\n293\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.670\nBut you could do more than one\noperating system side by side.\n\n294\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.300\nWhere the type one and the type two\nhypervisor really differ the most\n\n295\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.860\nis notice that the hypervisor sits,\nfiguratively speaking,\n\n296\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.800\non bare metal, all right?\n\n297\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.570\nYour hypervisor is below\nthe operating system, right?\n\n298\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.930\nAnd because of that you get\nbetter performance, why?\n\n299\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.030\nOperating system talks to the hypervisor\ntalks to the hardware, all right?\n\n300\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:52.150\nWhen you have this model you have a guest\noperating system, or the virtual machine\n\n301\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.620\nthat talks to the hypervisor that\ntalks to another operating system,\n\n302\n00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.260\nthat has to talk to this app,\nthis app, and this app.\n\n303\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.990\nAnd then get access to the hardware,\nright?\n\n304\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.370\nSo understand what you\nwill find inside of your\n\n305\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.610\nenterprise environments are the type one.\n\n306\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.840\nNow, one of the things that I mentioned,\nand I'll go ahead and minimize this,\n\n307\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.850\nget it out of the way for a second.\n\n308\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.211\nCuz I wanna bring you back to even a type\ntwo hypervisor because in look, right,\n\n309\n00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:18.374\nthey're not much different, right?\n\n310\n00:15:18.374 --> 00:15:21.442\nIf I have a type one hypervisor like\nHyper-V opened that's running on\n\n311\n00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:24.360\na Windows Server box,\nyou're gonna have an interface like this.\n\n312\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.520\nIt's gonna allow you to control it.\n\n313\n00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.130\nSo a lot of the basics are the same.\n\n314\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.476\nIt's really just underneath.\n\n315\n00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:31.813\nAll right, notice that I have three\ndifferent virtual machines over here And\n\n316\n00:15:31.813 --> 00:15:35.063\nthese are the ones that we've been\nusing throughout this series, right?\n\n317\n00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:38.867\nI've have been using Windows 7, I've been\nusing, really been using Windows 8.1, and\n\n318\n00:15:38.867 --> 00:15:41.860\nI'm also running a server 12 box,\nbut in the background, all right?\n\n319\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.130\nThat's my domain controller.\n\n320\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.356\nI can create, just like you said Dan,\n\n321\n00:15:46.356 --> 00:15:50.191\nthe whole live test environment\nthat you're seeing right here.\n\n322\n00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:53.491\nAnd guess what, you'll probably\nnotice that if I right click and\n\n323\n00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:57.181\nI choose snapshots, if I make a mistake\nguess what I just turn around.\n\n324\n00:15:57.181 --> 00:16:00.221\nI'm sorry I made a mistake\nI restore the snapshot and\n\n325\n00:16:00.221 --> 00:16:04.436\nnow I've restored the configuration\nof this machine to the point that it\n\n326\n00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:06.250\nwas at this time when I took it.\n\n327\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.640\n&gt;&gt; My favorite thing about virtualization\nis this right here, the snapshots.\n\n328\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.730\nAs I worked in corporate environment,\nif we didn't have this,\n\n329\n00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.440\nmy job would become very stressful and\nit would become very lengthy.\n\n330\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.510\nWith snapshots, I can take\na snapshot of the virtual machine.\n\n331\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.850\nI can go apply brand new updates and\nI don't worry about it, just say hey,\n\n332\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.960\nlet me know if anything breaks, if it does\nor if I'm trying to install an update or\n\n333\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.060\nmake a drastic change and\njust go sideways on me,\n\n334\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.960\nrestore the snapshot and\nI'm back in action, right?\n\n335\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.100\nTo my end users,\n\n336\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.100\ntheir experience is not diminished I just\nhave to come out another plan of attack.\n\n337\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.800\nI know the straight on approach\nisn't gonna work this time, and\n\n338\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.610\nit's my fall back.\n\n339\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.260\nIt works really great, it's a fantastic\nattribute using virtualization.\n\n340\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:50.810\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n341\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.710\nI consider it the get\nout of jail free card.\n\n342\n00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm, love it.\n\n343\n00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.390\n&gt;&gt; Because if not, you could definitely\nbe in some trouble if you didn't have\n\n344\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.780\nthis feature and\nyou make some kind of mistake.\n\n345\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.790\nNow, if we can take a look at\nthese other things that you do.\n\n346\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.200\nRemember I told you that\nyou can allocate resources.\n\n347\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.240\nIf I right click on one of these\nVirtual Machines, and I look,\n\n348\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.540\nthere is all kinds of things.\n\n349\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.440\nNow, these are specific to VMwares\nproducts, your VMware Fusion,\n\n350\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.120\nunderstand there is Virtual Box out there,\n\n351\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.650\nOpen source License, check it out,\ngreat utility to have access to.\n\n352\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Free ninety nine.\n\n353\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, free ninety nine, my best,\n\n354\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.510\nit's the best four letter\nword in the dictionary.\n\n355\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.090\n&gt;&gt; It's free, right?\n\n356\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:24.560\nNow, I will tell you.\n\n357\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.330\nYou have things like built-in\nto Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n358\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:33.300\nYou have what's known as Client-Side\nHyper-V which you can also run as well.\n\n359\n00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.335\nNotice that I've got access to things\nlike processor and memory, right.\n\n360\n00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:41.155\nAnd if I click this, now I'm not gonna\nmake any modifications cuz this is\n\n361\n00:17:41.155 --> 00:17:45.615\na paused virtual machine, but I can\nchange the processor cores if I wanted.\n\n362\n00:17:45.615 --> 00:17:47.635\nMaybe I need a little bit more power,\nright.\n\n363\n00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:48.565\nWell think about this.\n\n364\n00:17:48.565 --> 00:17:52.805\nIf you have a physical machine, I have to\nshut it off, I have to purchase more RAM,\n\n365\n00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:57.940\nor find RAM if I happen to have a few\nsticks that are just the same type.\n\n366\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.010\nAnd then I upgrade the memory, right?\n\n367\n00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.470\nWell, then virtualization is just\nthe click of a button, right?\n\n368\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.610\nI don't have enough machines.\n\n369\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.800\nI need another operator.\n\n370\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.920\nI need another machine.\n\n371\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.960\nWhat do I do?\n\n372\n00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.290\nWell, I go out to Tiger Direct.\n\n373\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.140\nI go out to Newegg.\n\n374\n00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.330\nI go out to whatever, wherever place\nthat you would buy a computer and\n\n375\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.660\nI purchase one.\n\n376\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.560\nNo, it's just as easy and this is another\nthing that I love that you can create\n\n377\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.170\na brand new VM here just like this,\nyou're right.\n\n378\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.620\nI walked through a little wizard\ndriven interface, choose continue,\n\n379\n00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.680\nI picked the platform and\nthis case that I want,\n\n380\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.800\nlet's say I want a Windows 8 64-bit and\nyou could see, we're not picking out and\n\n381\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.230\njust say, hey it's just Windows, look\nat all of these other ones that I have.\n\n382\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.470\nAnd I choose continue,\nall right and it asked me,\n\n383\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.690\nwell you want to create\na new virtual disk?\n\n384\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.220\nWhat's a virtual disk?\n\n385\n00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.070\nA virtual disk, virtual hard drive,\n\n386\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.520\nyou might hear them call it\na little few different things.\n\n387\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.630\nIt's just a folder but\nthe folder itself to this\n\n388\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.440\noperating system looks just\nlike a hardware hard disk.\n\n389\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.880\nRight?\nHard drive, if you will.\n\n390\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.040\nAnd it encompasses all of the file\noperations that a normal hard drive will.\n\n391\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.620\nAnd all I have to do is make sure that I\nhave enough space on the host operating\n\n392\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.560\nsystem, in this case the MAC that this is\nrunning on, to be able to allocate that.\n\n393\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.080\nRight?\n\n394\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.350\nAnd that's another thing I should mention.\n\n395\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.680\nIf you're going to make a virtual machine\nthe host, in this case my Mac OS,\n\n396\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.760\nit has to have enough memories,\nCPU if you will,\n\n397\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.840\nstorage to support it self and\nlend a little bit out, right?\n\n398\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.030\nIt's like your piece of the pie.\n\n399\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.250\nIf you don't have any pie to divvy up,\nwell,\n\n400\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.510\nyou just can't get something from nothing.\n\n401\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.320\nAll right?\n\n402\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.390\nI could even go as far as customizing\nthe settings if I wanted.\n\n403\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.390\nName this, if you will and\n\n404\n00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.720\nyou can see here some of the virtual\nhard drive are in the background.\n\n405\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.230\nI'll go ahead and,\nwhat will we call this, we'll just\n\n406\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:54.225\ncall this A+ VM Demo\nbecause I am very creative.\n\n407\n00:19:54.225 --> 00:19:55.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n408\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.240\nNow it's gonna try to,\nit didn't start up which is good.\n\n409\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.610\nNow I decide I wanna adjust some settings.\n\n410\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.970\nSo I go in here to the settings.\n\n411\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.340\nRight?\nThat we've just seen.\n\n412\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.760\nAnd I say you know what?\n\n413\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.590\nI think this one is gonna\nbe a little bit more beefy.\n\n414\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.100\nRight?\nMaybe Dan is gonna do some kind of\n\n415\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.870\ndatabase, some database\nfunctionality on it.\n\n416\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:13.890\nRight?\nWell I can't just go with\n\n417\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.820\nthe processor core.\n\n418\n00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.910\nOne processor core, maybe I need two.\n\n419\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.040\nSo now, because I've got this multicore\nprocessor that probably, a lot of times is\n\n420\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.240\nsitting there idly, Im not even utilizing\nsome of those cores, because I'm\n\n421\n00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.640\nnot really running very CPU intensive\nstuff, we can say, okay virtual machine,\n\n422\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.400\nwhen you need it there will be two cores\nright there that you can use, right?\n\n423\n00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.440\nYou need some more memory?\n\n424\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.620\nWell, let me go ahead and just allocate\nfour gigs of RAM to this machine.\n\n425\n00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.170\nRight?\nAnd\n\n426\n00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.500\nthen you can get into more advanced things\nthat you don't have to worry about, too.\n\n427\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.270\nThis actually allows for\nhypervisor within hypervisor.\n\n428\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.955\nBoy, that's tricky.\n\n429\n00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:48.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But notice-\n\n430\n00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.220\n&gt;&gt; Like the little Russian dolls.\n\n431\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.835\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Open it up, there's another one.\n\n432\n00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:52.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n433\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.120\nyeah, and notice that I can do things\nlike basically, network adapters,\n\n434\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.720\nI can make this multi home, I could put\nmore than one network adapter in it,\n\n435\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.040\nand sees all kinds of stuff, right?\n\n436\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.840\nNow, the other thing that\nI want you also know,\n\n437\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.970\nI mentioned a little bit about networking,\nokay, that I could add a network adapter.\n\n438\n00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.760\nAll right, I want you to be aware of the\ndifferent types of networks that we have\n\n439\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.660\nout here, and\n\n440\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.600\nthe different types of communications\nthat, that allows, all right?\n\n441\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.860\nSo I'm gonna go up here to the Preferences\nof this Type 2 Hypervisor.\n\n442\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.410\nAnd in this case I'm\ngonna choose Network and\n\n443\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.410\nI just wanna look at these couple of\ndifferent settings that we have, right?\n\n444\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.940\nYou've got a few different\nthings that you can do.\n\n445\n00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.310\nOne, you'll notice Internet Sharing.\n\n446\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:35.200\nThis is where I'm allowed\nto communicate with my Mac.\n\n447\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.180\nAnd my Mac is gonna provide\nnetwork address translation and\n\n448\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.770\nlet this communicate with the rest\nof the network, all right?\n\n449\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.310\nUnderstand that the network\ncommunications now,\n\n450\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.680\nwe're not isolating things anymore, right?\n\n451\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.490\nYou're gonna be able to communicate in\nthis virtual machine just like it was\n\n452\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.290\nattached to the physical network and\n\n453\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.510\nthe Mac is acting like a almost like\na home router doing net, all right?\n\n454\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.990\nBridged networking makes\nthis virtual machine look\n\n455\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.190\nlike it's own independent system\non the network, all right?\n\n456\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.250\nWhich means, guess what,\nif you get a virus on this thing, you're\n\n457\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.900\ngonna connect like any other machine, it\nbehaves like any other machine, all right?\n\n458\n00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.590\nThe next one here is private to my Mac,\ncustom, and\n\n459\n00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.200\nwhat that means is I want to allow\nmaybe file sharing, all right,\n\n460\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.220\nfolder sharing between my Mac and\nmy guest operator, a host and\n\n461\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.860\na guest operating system, I could\npass those between each other, right?\n\n462\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.010\nSo you pay attention to what the platform\nis that you have cuz in networking you,\n\n463\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:37.280\njust trying to be bender neutral on this\none, you have three types, all right.\n\n464\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.670\nAnd I'm just kinda generically\nmention them here.\n\n465\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.590\nGuest to guest, which means\n\n466\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.860\ncommunications happen only between\nthe virtual machines themselves, right.\n\n467\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.700\nThese are guest operating systems\nont he Mac which is the host.\n\n468\n00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.790\nYou have guest to host.\n\n469\n00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:59.400\nThat means that these virtual machines\ncan physically talk to my MAC, right?\n\n470\n00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.120\nThat means that if I\nopen that communication,\n\n471\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.960\nanything that happens to the guest\ncould potentially harm the host.\n\n472\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.480\nYou're breaking down the barriers.\n\n473\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.830\nThe last one I would say is\nwhat's known as guest to LAN And\n\n474\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.980\nthat's when you allow whatever form it is\n\n475\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.930\nthe guest operating system to now\ncommunicate across the network.\n\n476\n00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.580\nAnd you can see by this software\nthere's actually a couple of different\n\n477\n00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.490\nways you could do that.\n\n478\n00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.760\nYou could do it through network\naddress translation,or you could\n\n479\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.890\nallow it to just be it's\nown entity on the network.\n\n480\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes when you start\ntalking networking,\n\n481\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.690\nyou start talking about computers\ntalking to other computers.\n\n482\n00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.379\nEspecially when you get outward\nthat isolation becomes less and\n\n483\n00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:47.174\nless and less as you get tot the Internet\nyou'll have to bring up security, right.\n\n484\n00:23:47.174 --> 00:23:51.268\nAnd virtualization has\nstandard security practises,\n\n485\n00:23:51.268 --> 00:23:56.762\ntraditional security but it also it\nhas it's own setup security avenues.\n\n486\n00:23:56.762 --> 00:23:57.522\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n487\n00:23:57.522 --> 00:23:58.401\nYes it does.\n\n488\n00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.998\nAnd There's a few different\nways that you can do this.\n\n489\n00:24:00.998 --> 00:24:02.133\nAlways secure the host.\n\n490\n00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:03.224\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Gotta, I mean,\n\n491\n00:24:03.224 --> 00:24:06.561\nthat's just basic security of\nevery operating system, all right?\n\n492\n00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:08.030\nKeep that in mind.\n\n493\n00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.016\nSo secure the host,\n\n494\n00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:12.670\nbut secure the guest just like you\nwould any other operating system, too.\n\n495\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.687\nSo for instance, we're running Windows 7,\nwe're Windows 8.1.\n\n496\n00:24:16.687 --> 00:24:20.324\nI need to make sure that I've got\nscheduled Windows Defender scans going on\n\n497\n00:24:20.324 --> 00:24:21.950\nin the virtual machine, right?\n\n498\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:26.110\nIf I'm running Windows 7, I wanna\ninstall Security Essentials, right?\n\n499\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.210\nCould be something like this.\n\n500\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.810\nIn fact, let me show you here.\n\n501\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.859\nAnd again,\nnotice that VMware also in this space,\n\n502\n00:24:32.859 --> 00:24:38.050\nVMware Fusion also allows you to\ninstall McAfee AntiVirus Plus.\n\n503\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.285\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it can do full monitoring,\n\n504\n00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:41.200\nthe hypervisor.\n\n505\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.260\nAnd this happens, the hypervisor can\nactually do the monitoring of the VM.\n\n506\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.465\nSo again, make sure that you\nare doing normal security practices,\n\n507\n00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:54.481\nthe same security practices that you'd\ndo if you take virtualization out of it,\n\n508\n00:24:54.481 --> 00:24:57.380\nalways have to apply to\nthese guest machines.\n\n509\n00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.820\nThat brings us to our next concept,\nand that's the cloud, all right?\n\n510\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.330\nWhen I talk about the cloud,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n511\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.677\nWell, you have a few\ndifferent types of services,\n\n512\n00:25:06.677 --> 00:25:10.461\nand then I'll kinda come back to why these\nare kind of, not really one in the same-\n\n513\n00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:11.033\n&gt;&gt; They hold hands [CROSSTALK].\n\n514\n00:25:11.033 --> 00:25:12.653\n&gt;&gt; But they hold hands, that's right.\n\n515\n00:25:12.653 --> 00:25:14.760\nYou have what's known as\nsoftware as a service.\n\n516\n00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.632\nSoftware as a service is a typically\na cloud provider, gives you a software\n\n517\n00:25:19.632 --> 00:25:25.222\nplatform that they maintain the updates,\nyou connect to via a user account, right?\n\n518\n00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:30.460\nSo username and password, and\nthen you use their software, all right?\n\n519\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.700\nYou probably have been using these for\na very long time and\n\n520\n00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.670\ndidn't even realize it, right?\n\n521\n00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:36.870\nThings like Gmail, right?\n\n522\n00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.990\nThat is a classic example\nof software as a service.\n\n523\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.372\nYou're using their email servers,\ntheir email service,\n\n524\n00:25:43.372 --> 00:25:45.860\nbut you don't maintain a single bit of it.\n\n525\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.959\nNot a single Gmail server is\nsitting in your closet right now.\n\n526\n00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:50.339\nIf it is, you're probably in trouble.\n\n527\n00:25:50.339 --> 00:25:51.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n528\n00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:52.216\n&gt;&gt; Is that the cops, Wes?\n\n529\n00:25:52.216 --> 00:25:55.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH], run.\n\n530\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.860\n&gt;&gt; Here they come,\nas long as they can get away.\n\n531\n00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.880\nThings like Google Docs, right?\n\n532\n00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.000\nWell, and that's not only.\n\n533\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.790\nYou have things like Office 365, right?\n\n534\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.250\nIf you think about it,\nyou can have everything in the cloud,\n\n535\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.910\nall the applications,\nthe OfficeSuite is in the cloud.\n\n536\n00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.842\n&gt;&gt; Technically,\nFacebook is software as a service.\n\n537\n00:26:11.842 --> 00:26:12.666\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n538\n00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:15.770\nSocial media, that's a classic\nexample of software as a service.\n\n539\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.294\nTwitter accounts, right, LinkedIn, all of\nthese is an application that somebody else\n\n540\n00:26:20.294 --> 00:26:23.190\nis running, maintaining,\nand allowing you to use it.\n\n541\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.440\nThat's software as a service.\n\n542\n00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.500\nIt gives you things like redundancy and\nrecovery because guess what?\n\n543\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.429\nOne of their networks goes down,\nin the background they got people\n\n544\n00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:34.035\nthat are working 24/7 to make sure that\nthey update it, they maintain it, and\n\n545\n00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:35.990\nthat they can also do\nthings like failover.\n\n546\n00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.840\nThey support the infrastructure.\n\n547\n00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.249\nNow speaking of infrastructure,\n\n548\n00:26:40.249 --> 00:26:42.830\nyou also have something known\nas infrastructure as a service.\n\n549\n00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.370\nAnd infrastructure as a service is where\nwe get to the virtual machines, right?\n\n550\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.070\nThis is where you have your\ncomputing resources, right?\n\n551\n00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:56.150\nI need a virtual machine, but\nI don't want to buy 400 Macs.\n\n552\n00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.146\nI don't wanna buy 50 Macs, and\n\n553\n00:26:58.146 --> 00:27:02.363\nthen install the virtual machines\non every one of them, or whatever.\n\n554\n00:27:02.363 --> 00:27:06.525\nSo I can go to a service provider,\nactually,\n\n555\n00:27:06.525 --> 00:27:11.124\nthey could do it, or\nyour IT staff, can create all\n\n556\n00:27:11.124 --> 00:27:16.710\nthe virtual machines out there\nin the cloud, all right?\n\n557\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.148\nAnd all your employees need\nare web browsers, essentially, and\n\n558\n00:27:20.148 --> 00:27:23.600\nthey can connect to it, and\nthey can use their virtual machines.\n\n559\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.534\nBut it also gives you things\nlike computational power and\n\n560\n00:27:26.534 --> 00:27:29.418\nthe fact that you can have\nservers up there, all right?\n\n561\n00:27:29.418 --> 00:27:32.355\nNow you mentioned a term when we\nfirst started, on-prem, right?\n\n562\n00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:33.022\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n563\n00:27:33.022 --> 00:27:34.647\n&gt;&gt; And private cloud, right?\n\n564\n00:27:34.647 --> 00:27:38.031\nAnd this is where I wanna kinda\ndistinguish the cloud side of this so\n\n565\n00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:41.120\nwe can understand the different models,\nright?\n\n566\n00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.355\nSo you have on-premises, right?\n\n567\n00:27:43.355 --> 00:27:45.463\nOn-premises infrastructure, if you will,\n\n568\n00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:48.440\nis going to be the servers that\nare sitting in your server closet.\n\n569\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.653\nYour IT staff that is going to\nwalk into that server closet and\n\n570\n00:27:51.653 --> 00:27:54.240\nis going to maintain those servers,\nall right?\n\n571\n00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.330\nYour web server, your email servers, now\nthat is on-premises, it's a private cloud.\n\n572\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.680\nSo what does private cloud mean?\n\n573\n00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.320\nPrivate cloud means you own it.\n\n574\n00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.020\nNobody else has access to it,\nunlike something like this,\n\n575\n00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.320\nwhere you have infrastructure as\na service that is out in the cloud.\n\n576\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.399\nYou have what's known as\nmulti-tenant services.\n\n577\n00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:17.434\nWhich means, let's say theoretically,\nI'll tell you what,\n\n578\n00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:22.289\nlet's say Office Pro is its complete\nown separate entity, OfficePro.tv,\n\n579\n00:28:22.289 --> 00:28:26.490\neven though it's all under\nthe ITProTV infrastructure, right?\n\n580\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.340\nYou own OfficePro.tv.\n\n581\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.025\nI don't have access to your resources,\nall right?\n\n582\n00:28:31.025 --> 00:28:33.975\nAnd let's say that I'm running\nITProTV which I don't.\n\n583\n00:28:33.975 --> 00:28:36.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dan wouldn't have access to anything,\n\n584\n00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:40.221\neven though it's on the same platform,\nto any of my services, right?\n\n585\n00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:40.894\nYou get that isolation.\n\n586\n00:28:40.894 --> 00:28:41.879\n&gt;&gt; Like separated companies.\n\n587\n00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:43.074\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n588\n00:28:43.074 --> 00:28:45.261\nThe hybrid model, all right,\n\n589\n00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:49.725\nthe hybrid model is one where\nyou blend that, all right?\n\n590\n00:28:49.725 --> 00:28:52.680\nAnd when we talk about blending,\nlet me go ahead and show you.\n\n591\n00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.545\nIt's a kind of a big diagram here, but\nyou have your on-prem private right?\n\n592\n00:28:57.545 --> 00:29:01.105\nYou have your in the cloud,\nwhich we're gonna pay as a service.\n\n593\n00:29:01.105 --> 00:29:05.235\nAnd this could be for, maybe, in some\nsites you have some local resources.\n\n594\n00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:09.670\nBut maybe in some sites you don't\neven have an IT staff, right?\n\n595\n00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.672\nMaybe you got a help desk person,\nand they just carry monitors and\n\n596\n00:29:12.672 --> 00:29:14.756\ndo a little bit of cabling from now and\nagain.\n\n597\n00:29:14.756 --> 00:29:16.320\nWell, guess what?\n\n598\n00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.950\nThey're gonna be using the public cloud.\n\n599\n00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.277\nAnd again, that's probably what\nI should let you guys know,\n\n600\n00:29:21.277 --> 00:29:22.676\nprivate cloud versus public cloud.\n\n601\n00:29:22.676 --> 00:29:26.235\nPublic cloud, we could both, Dan and\nI have our businesses, let's say,\n\n602\n00:29:26.235 --> 00:29:27.710\nwith Amazon or Azure.\n\n603\n00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.610\nPrivate cloud, go ahead, I was gonna say,\nprivate cloud means that,\n\n604\n00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.806\nI'm gonna maintain it and\nDan doesn't have access to it.\n\n605\n00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all I was gonna say is if the\nterm cloud is confusing to you, you think,\n\n606\n00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.225\nwell, this cloud, we really, just think,\nwe used to call it the Web, right?\n\n607\n00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:42.805\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n608\n00:29:42.805 --> 00:29:47.232\n&gt;&gt; That is the only difference is we have\nchanged names for it, cuz we kept drawing\n\n609\n00:29:47.232 --> 00:29:51.480\na little cloud in diagrams, and\npeople just started calling it the cloud.\n\n610\n00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.020\nIt's just basically internet services.\n\n611\n00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.205\nIt's out on the web, which I don't\ncontrol, you don't control, and Wes,\n\n612\n00:29:56.205 --> 00:29:58.176\nI'm pretty sure you\ndon't control it either.\n\n613\n00:29:58.176 --> 00:29:58.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n614\n00:29:58.933 --> 00:29:59.990\nif I do I'm not gonna let you know.\n\n615\n00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.299\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n616\n00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.852\n&gt;&gt; So a couple things, and\nI know we're coming up on time.\n\n617\n00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:05.600\nA couple other things that\nI kinda wanna mention.\n\n618\n00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.050\nI wanna mention platform as a service.\n\n619\n00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.363\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at,\nthis is the other one here, and\n\n620\n00:30:10.363 --> 00:30:12.530\nthere all some that are blooming everyday.\n\n621\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.281\nWe have storage as a service, security as\na service, Windows as a service today, but\n\n622\n00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.700\nthese are the three major ones.\n\n623\n00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.250\nPlatform as a service.\n\n624\n00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.710\nWhat if I'm a developer?\n\n625\n00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.980\nI need an execution environment for\nmy software.\n\n626\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.260\nI need to write and test software.\n\n627\n00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.420\nWell, that's were platform\nas a service comes in.\n\n628\n00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.396\nPlatform as a service is that execution,\n\n629\n00:30:29.396 --> 00:30:33.300\nthat runtime environment that software\ndevelopers, teams, can get together.\n\n630\n00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.840\nThey can spin these\nenvironments up really quick.\n\n631\n00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.879\nAnd even themselves, without needing to\npull Dan as a systems administrator, or\n\n632\n00:30:39.879 --> 00:30:43.230\nmyself over, and say, hey,\nI need you to get these servers ready.\n\n633\n00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.150\nCan you get the operating installed,\nright?\n\n634\n00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.141\nNo, the dev team can do that, right?\n\n635\n00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:51.340\nThat's essentially allowing your\napplication development and\n\n636\n00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.710\ntesting inside in the cloud, okay?\n\n637\n00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.676\nNow last thing that I do wanna mention,\n\n638\n00:30:55.676 --> 00:30:58.880\nthere are a couple things\nthat you should be aware of.\n\n639\n00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.350\nOne is known as elasticity, all right?\n\n640\n00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.510\nNow when you look at the exam objectives,\nthey say rapid elasticity.\n\n641\n00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.419\nAnd you might be looking out there, well,\n\n642\n00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:09.870\nI don't see anything that's\ncall rapid elasticity.\n\n643\n00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.920\nElasticity, in general, is rapid.\n\n644\n00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.330\nIt's one of the benefits of being\nable to say, hey, you know what?\n\n645\n00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.820\nI know Black Friday's coming up.\n\n646\n00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.530\nI've got one server right now.\n\n647\n00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.634\nBut I know, that day,\n\n648\n00:31:19.634 --> 00:31:22.960\nI'm gonna need ten because people\nare gonna be hitting my website.\n\n649\n00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.300\nSo I can stretch out those resources,\nright?\n\n650\n00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.880\nThey call that on demand, right?\n\n651\n00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.350\nThey are all kinda work\ntogether hand in hand here.\n\n652\n00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.090\nRapid elasticity just means I call Dan up,\nand say, hey man,\n\n653\n00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.475\nwe got Black Friday coming up.\n\n654\n00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:38.275\nHe goes, all right, I've you ten\ninstances of LAMP going on, Linux,\n\n655\n00:31:38.275 --> 00:31:41.320\nApache, MySQL, and PHP, or Perl, right?\n\n656\n00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.170\nSpins up the environment, we're ready to\ngo, and that was a week ahead of time.\n\n657\n00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.954\nOr even you can schedule some of this\nstuff, and plan for it, and say, hey where\n\n658\n00:31:48.954 --> 00:31:52.763\ngonna, again, the elasticity part,\nwe're gonna stretch out the services.\n\n659\n00:31:52.763 --> 00:31:55.751\nAnd when we need them, right,\nit's a measured service, by the way,\n\n660\n00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.029\nyou pay for what you utilize.\n\n661\n00:31:57.029 --> 00:32:00.695\nSo wouldn't it be nice the next day,\nwhen we don't need those resources?\n\n662\n00:32:00.695 --> 00:32:03.192\nAgain like a rubber band,\ncomes back down to what we originally had.\n\n663\n00:32:03.192 --> 00:32:05.234\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; What's so cool that stuff like,\n\n664\n00:32:05.234 --> 00:32:07.270\nyou don't even have to, other than.\n\n665\n00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.810\nYou go into it, and\nyou just say, you know what,\n\n666\n00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:13.480\nI'm willing to spend X amount of dollars\nand when I need it, ramp up to this.\n\n667\n00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.690\nDon't go beyond that,\nbecause I can't afford it.\n\n668\n00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.240\nRight.\n\n669\n00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.920\nBut ramp up to this and\nwhen you don't need it, ramp it back down.\n\n670\n00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.213\nIt's a set it and\nforget it Ron Popeil kinda thing.\n\n671\n00:32:21.213 --> 00:32:23.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You just make that adjustment and\n\n672\n00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.260\nthen when the system sees that you\ndo more resources, it just does it.\n\n673\n00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.250\nAnd when it sees that you don't,\nit just brings it back down.\n\n674\n00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.360\nIt is so nice, it is one of the best\naspects of the Cloud services.\n\n675\n00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the other thing two is\nbeing able to bundle all those resources\n\n676\n00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.630\ntogether.\n\n677\n00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.910\nWe call it resource pooling.\n\n678\n00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.227\nThe fact that I've got a lot\nof these resources and\n\n679\n00:32:41.227 --> 00:32:43.700\nI can put them all together\nwhen I need them and then I can\n\n680\n00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.560\ndeviate them when I don't need them, and\nI can allocate them more efficiently.\n\n681\n00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.160\nI didn't mention one last model, and\nthat's called the community model.\n\n682\n00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.580\nA community model is where one or\nmore businesses, usually only two,\n\n683\n00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.750\nabout one or more businesses\nshare a Cloud System together And\n\n684\n00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.720\na lot of times what you all see\nis that they have a common goal\n\n685\n00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.250\nwhatever their common, a common lead\nin their business model or the business\n\n686\n00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.880\nI guess direction only been giving example\nan insurance company or doctor's office.\n\n687\n00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.570\nThey might need access to protect\ntheir healthcare information\n\n688\n00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.140\nbecause doctors have to be able\nto keep medical records and\n\n689\n00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.500\nsometimes insurance company might need\nto access those type of records, right?\n\n690\n00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.270\nWell it would benefit them so that they\ndon't have to spend all the resources.\n\n691\n00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:33.850\nEach company has that common goal, if you\nwill, that they end up sharing a cloud.\n\n692\n00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.030\nAnd again,\nthat's more of a community-based model.\n\n693\n00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.250\nSo do keep those in mind.\n\n694\n00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:43.160\nRemember that virtualization being\nable to utilize other resources,\n\n695\n00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.520\nthat's the last thing I wanna mention.\n\n696\n00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.650\nAnd we will get done and I will quit\nlast this, last that on you, Dan.\n\n697\n00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.210\nRemember, virtualization is one of\nthe reasons that we can take advantage of\n\n698\n00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:56.310\nthese different cloud-based services,\nbecause these companies out there spend\n\n699\n00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.790\nmillions and millions of dollars if\nnot billions of dollars to have these\n\n700\n00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.940\nmassive infrastructures where\nthey're doing virtualization and\n\n701\n00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.880\nthey're giving you access to the network.\n\n702\n00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.700\nAnd the only thing that you have to do is\ncome with your basically your wallet and\n\n703\n00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.770\nwhatever you can afford to spend,\nwhatever service that you can pay for\n\n704\n00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.270\nyou pay for, and\nwhat you don't need you don't pay for.\n\n705\n00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.380\nSo it's a great thing to have,\nthey are separate concepts but\n\n706\n00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.870\nkeep in mind today that they\nreally are helping each other out.\n\n707\n00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:24.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n708\n00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:30.050\nCloud and virtualization, obviously two\nsides of a very intensely important coin.\n\n709\n00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.570\nSo get familiar with it, start using it.\n\n710\n00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.740\nIf you've never played with virtualization\nbefore Wes has already pointed there\n\n711\n00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.230\nare free entities out there\nallowing you to do that.\n\n712\n00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.820\nVirtual box is a great one,\nwe love that one.\n\n713\n00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.490\nSo go out there, there's no reason for\n\n714\n00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:45.580\nyou to not get your feet wet there and\nstart playing around with it.\n\n715\n00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.680\nAlso if you've never played around with\nCloud technologies, which you have,\n\n716\n00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.602\nyou just haven't probably\nrealized it at this point.\n\n717\n00:34:50.602 --> 00:34:54.400\nBut AWS free,\nhas a free tier you can sign up for\n\n718\n00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.670\na year free and just play around with it.\n\n719\n00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:58.690\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n720\n00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.600\nGets you more familiarized\nwith those things.\n\n721\n00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.270\nSo use those resources to\nyour advantage to figure out\n\n722\n00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.957\nall that stuff we've been talking\nabout this here 30 minutes.\n\n723\n00:35:05.957 --> 00:35:06.990\nWes, thanks for dropping by.\n\n724\n00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Appreciate your time and\n\n725\n00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.160\neffort on this show.\n\n726\n00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.520\nWe do thank you our audience out there for\nwatching.\n\n727\n00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.180\nBut

00:00:07.984\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:11.421\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:13.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.850\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.989\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.560\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore on our A+ accelerated series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.316\nJoining us yet again in the studio right\nhere, right now for your viewing benefit,\n\n10\n00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:27.776\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:29.240\nWelcome back, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.750\nThat's right,\nas we journey on in our accelerated track,\n\n14\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.010\nwell we're gonna keep\nthe acceleration going.\n\n15\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.554\nWe're gonna dive into, really we've\nbeen moving through our domain, too.\n\n16\n00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:45.112\nWhen we talk about things like other\noperating systems and technologies,\n\n17\n00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:49.976\nit is important to understand that not\neverything is gonna be Windows-based.\n\n18\n00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:54.110\nAnd even if you are in Windows-based\nenvironments that sometimes our computers\n\n19\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.628\nare gonna have to reach out and\n\n20\n00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:58.990\nthey're gonna have to rely on\nresources from other computers.\n\n21\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.905\nSo what we're gonna be looking\nat is network host and\n\n22\n00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:02.132\nthe services that are provided.\n\n23\n00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:05.630\nNow, when I say that,\nI wanna get in our Delorean here,\n\n24\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.472\nwe're gonna drive 88.5 miles per hour.\n\n25\n00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:12.570\n&gt;&gt; It's 88.\n&gt;&gt; 88 miles an hour, thank you there.\n\n26\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.367\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go back in time and\n\n27\n00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.821\nwe're gonna talk about that term hosts,\nor host if you will, right?\n\n28\n00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:24.590\nIn earlier networking models, and\nthis networking model is still used today.\n\n29\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.680\nBut it was the primary type of\nnetworking model in the early days of\n\n30\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.850\nbusiness computing.\n\n31\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.350\nWe called it a host based network,\na host network.\n\n32\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.720\nIt was a centralized network.\n\n33\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.570\nAnd there was one massive machine and\nit hosted all this CPU,\n\n34\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.810\nthe processing if you will.\n\n35\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.030\nIt had all the computational power\nnot only for the processing.\n\n36\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.062\nIt also hosted all the memory resources,\nthe network communications,\n\n37\n00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:53.190\ncontrolled all of that,\nstorage everything, right.\n\n38\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.536\nThose were the days in the mainframe,\nyou had a centralized host,\n\n39\n00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:59.306\nthey called it the host,\nbasically the host machine.\n\n40\n00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.321\nIt hosted all the resources, all right.\n\n41\n00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.200\nWell, don't think that\nmodel doesn't exist today,\n\n42\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.780\nmajor corporations use\nmainframe still today.\n\n43\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.105\nHowever, it didn't become\nthe most dominating type\n\n44\n00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:14.960\nof enterprise type based network,\nall right?\n\n45\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.840\nWe moved into what was known\nas a Client Server Model.\n\n46\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.170\nAnd a client, okay, so\na listifying client.\n\n47\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.473\nClient is essentially an operating\nsystem that is relying and\n\n48\n00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:30.037\nrequesting resources from other\noperating systems, all right.\n\n49\n00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:33.287\nAnd if we're in a peer-to-peer network,\nthey're called peers.\n\n50\n00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:37.757\nBecause sometimes they're requesting\nresources, acting like a client, but\n\n51\n00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:41.428\nthen sometimes, they're providing\nresources and services and\n\n52\n00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:43.980\nthat means acting like a server,\nall right.\n\n53\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.030\nAnd we call them peers in a peer to\npeer network because they're doing both.\n\n54\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.170\nBut in a client/server network you\nhave a group of computers whose\n\n55\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.160\nbasic functionality is to request\nthose resources from other computers.\n\n56\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.440\nAnd then there's a series of computers\nthat are hosting those resources.\n\n57\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.760\nIn the earlier days, again, there was\na single host hosting everything.\n\n58\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.337\nThe problem was\na disconnection from that host\n\n59\n00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:10.480\nmeans that all productivity would be lost.\n\n60\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.530\nAnd that's why when we moved\ninto the Client Server Model,\n\n61\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.900\nthe client is an operating system that can\ncontrol its own network communications.\n\n62\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.240\nYou can provide most of your\nday to day functionality and\n\n63\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.970\nnever even need resources\nfrom other computers.\n\n64\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.380\nNow, that's not always the case, but for\n\n65\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.640\nthe most part,\ngenerically speaking that can happen.\n\n66\n00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.630\nBut there are times when\nthe computer has to reach out and\n\n67\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.490\nit has to say hey I need something\nfrom another operating system.\n\n68\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.960\nAnd that other operating\nsystem's out there listening and\n\n69\n00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.390\nsaying yeah I'm hosting that service.\n\n70\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.415\nYou can come over here and\nyou can find that service,\n\n71\n00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:41.713\nI'll provide you that service.\n\n72\n00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:46.078\nSo understand that, we gotta be careful\nwith the term, network hosts, right?\n\n73\n00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:51.135\nWhen we say network hosts,\nin this context, what we're talking about,\n\n74\n00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:55.948\nis that operating system, that\ncomputer is hosting a resource that it\n\n75\n00:03:55.948 --> 00:04:00.130\nis going to provide extended or\nadditional functionality.\n\n76\n00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.820\nPretty much your productivity, all right,\nwithin your corporate environments.\n\n77\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.183\nNot everyone of these has to be\nin a corporate environment but\n\n78\n00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:11.189\nyou do find the majority of them there,\nall right.\n\n79\n00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.270\nLet's talk about something known\nas an authentication server.\n\n80\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.740\nWe talk about an authentication server,\ngot a little diagram here, right.\n\n81\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.444\nVery basic,\n\n82\n00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:24.125\nauthentication server, this is when you're\nin some kind of Windows domain, right.\n\n83\n00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:28.326\nI have a computer that is a client its\njoined to the domain it has a trust\n\n84\n00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:32.200\nrelationship with another\ncomputer out there.\n\n85\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.049\nThat is gonna verify that when you log in,\nI'm gonna check the database cuz I've\n\n86\n00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:40.257\ngot your user account, and\nI've got your password,\n\n87\n00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:44.270\nthe computer if you will,\nhosting that service stored here on me.\n\n88\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.443\nNow when you log in, essentially,\nI could check that list and\n\n89\n00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:50.165\nI can make sure that\nyour password is right.\n\n90\n00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.895\nI can apply all the privileges and\n\n91\n00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:55.675\npermissions that you have\nwithin this corporate network\n\n92\n00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:58.035\nright to your user account and\nthen you can be on your way, right.\n\n93\n00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:02.705\nNow authentication server,\nI said Windows domain,\n\n94\n00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:06.330\nplease understand it doesn't have\nto be just the Windows domain.\n\n95\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.410\nAny kind of centralized\nmanagement software\n\n96\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.700\nrunning on a server can provide\nyou that authentication.\n\n97\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.220\nOne of the most common ones is Kerberos.\n\n98\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.650\nOr Kerberos or Kerberos,\nhelp me out there Dan.\n\n99\n00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.109\n&gt;&gt; That would be Kerberos.\n\n100\n00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:22.064\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n101\n00:05:22.064 --> 00:05:25.007\nI leave it to Dan when it comes when\nit comes to the English language,\n\n102\n00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:26.309\ncuz I speak three languages.\n\n103\n00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.434\n&gt;&gt; Swiss, English and that's Greek.\n\n104\n00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:29.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n\n105\n00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:31.582\nI'm multilingual, I speak three languages.\n\n106\n00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:32.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.276\n&gt;&gt; I speak good English.\n\n108\n00:05:33.276 --> 00:05:34.505\n&gt;&gt; Gooder English.\n\n109\n00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:36.629\n&gt;&gt; I speak bad English and\nI speak worser English.\n\n110\n00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:37.314\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n111\n00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:40.384\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Please understand that\n\n112\n00:05:40.384 --> 00:05:43.493\nthe authentication server\nprovides that resource for us,\n\n113\n00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:47.545\nthat essentially allows me to log on\nto a group of corporate devices, right.\n\n114\n00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:50.024\nNow, the next one that we have, well,\n\n115\n00:05:50.024 --> 00:05:53.870\nwe've got some other services\nthat are provided out there.\n\n116\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.640\nWe've got name resolution.\n\n117\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.488\nIn other episodes,\nwe've talked about Domain Name System.\n\n118\n00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:03.588\nDomain Name System essentially is\na service that allows us to type a name,\n\n119\n00:06:03.588 --> 00:06:05.890\nhave it mapped to an IP address and\n\n120\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.860\nthen we can connect typically\nthe things like websites.\n\n121\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.800\nIt's not just websites, a lot of\ndevices out there that use DNS and\n\n122\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.470\nuse name resolution.\n\n123\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.506\nBecause for me,\nit's easier to remember something like\n\n124\n00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:23.570\nwww.google.com than try to type\nthat four octet IP address, right.\n\n125\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.059\nEssentially on a TCP/IP based network\nwe communicate with IP addresses.\n\n126\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.615\nBut nobody’s got time to remember all\nthose IP addresses to every computer\n\n127\n00:06:31.615 --> 00:06:34.371\nthat you're gonna visit out\nthere on the Internet, right?\n\n128\n00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.844\nBe like trying to tell you we've\ngot contacts in our phone,\n\n129\n00:06:37.844 --> 00:06:42.443\nhow many of the phone numbers can you\nremember off the top of your head, right?\n\n130\n00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:45.512\nI can't remember pretty much\nif I lose [LAUGH] my phone,\n\n131\n00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:49.240\nI lose access to being able to\ncall anybody from another phone.\n\n132\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.526\nBecause I'm just using the contact and\nit takes their name and\n\n133\n00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.749\nit maps it to their phone number, right.\n\n134\n00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:58.067\nWell, DNS takes a fully\nqualified domain name and\n\n135\n00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:02.970\nmaps it to an IP address and our computer\ncan now find where that device is.\n\n136\n00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.194\nThat network if you will,\nthat other network operating system.\n\n137\n00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:11.850\nNow, and you know what?\n\n138\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.650\nI got one more here.\n\n139\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.840\nI've gotta scroll down a little bit,\nall right.\n\n140\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.870\nAnd I don't have the DHCP server here.\n\n141\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.210\nSo let me go ahead without a diagram and\nmention DHCP server.\n\n142\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.990\nI thought I might have the DHCP server\nin here, but I do not, all right.\n\n143\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.933\nAnother service that is out there,\nall right, that a host could be providing\n\n144\n00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:31.755\na service is the dynamic\nhost configuration protocol.\n\n145\n00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:32.510\n&gt;&gt; Also an important one.\n\n146\n00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.052\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very, very important.\n\n147\n00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:36.651\nAnd we talk about this in another episode,\nright,\n\n148\n00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:39.135\ndynamic host configuration protocol,\nright.\n\n149\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.556\nBut basically,\n\n150\n00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:46.640\nit allows me to get an IP address from\nanother device if I don't have one.\n\n151\n00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.569\nI don't have to manually assign\nIP addresses to many of these\n\n152\n00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:53.120\ndifferent devices within my network.\n\n153\n00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.560\nFive computers, it's okay.\n\n154\n00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.587\nAssign an IP address,\nsubnet mask, default gateway,\n\n155\n00:07:57.587 --> 00:07:59.065\nlike we talked about in other episodes.\n\n156\n00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:03.364\nBut if I've got 500 computers,\n5,000 computers-\n\n157\n00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:03.938\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden,\n\n158\n00:08:03.938 --> 00:08:05.337\nyou're rethinking your life choices.\n\n159\n00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:07.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Manually.\n\n160\n00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:09.277\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say if you're paid hourly,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n161\n00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:09.788\nThen.\n\n162\n00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:10.499\nThere you go.\n\n163\n00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:10.999\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's okay.\n\n164\n00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:12.007\nI'll start this week and\n\n165\n00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:14.460\nby the end of the next week it\nwill be time to start over again.\n\n166\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.058\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n167\n00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:16.173\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even if I've got enough of them done.\n\n168\n00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:16.877\nRight?\n\n169\n00:08:16.877 --> 00:08:19.950\nNot to mention you guys have seen me type.\n\n170\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.830\nThe typos.\n\n171\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.510\nThe configuration errors.\n\n172\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that brings up a valid point.\n\n173\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.150\nIf you had to do this manually how often\nare you going to type it in incorrectly?\n\n174\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.833\nOr you did type it correctly but\n\n175\n00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:33.604\nyou also typed the exact same correct\ninformation on this computer.\n\n176\n00:08:33.604 --> 00:08:38.302\nThis is something that we as people\ntend to do, not that we intend to, but\n\n177\n00:08:38.302 --> 00:08:42.940\nit does happen using the service\nallows us to mitigate those problems.\n\n178\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.710\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and\n\n179\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.710\nthen the host configuration part is its\nhost configuration I can do all kinds\n\n180\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.240\nof other things that you don't even really\nneed to know about at the A+ level.\n\n181\n00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.500\nDynamic host configuration protocol that\nservice being provided by another network\n\n182\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.422\nhost is really,\nthese are the two main protocols.\n\n183\n00:09:00.422 --> 00:09:03.870\nTCP/IP is made up of a lot\nof different protocols, but\n\n184\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.520\nthese are really, really two important\n\n185\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.580\nprotocols when it comes to just basic\ncommunications inside of your network.\n\n186\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.360\nNow that being said, we also have email\nservers that we have to be aware of too.\n\n187\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.150\nNow, with the diagram that I have here, I\nwant you to understand that when it comes\n\n188\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:27.000\nto these network hosts, pay attention\nto the direction of the communication.\n\n189\n00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.880\nWe have SMTP,\nsimple mail transfer protocol, and\n\n190\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.920\nthat goes over port 25, but\nnotice the direction of the arrow.\n\n191\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.000\nIt's going to the network host,\nto the server if you will.\n\n192\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.120\nNow you might say, wait a second,\n\n193\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.550\ndidn't you just tell us as we start\nthat this is requesting resources?\n\n194\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.100\nWhat are you requesting if you're\nsending something to the server?\n\n195\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.630\nI want you to think about your mailbox.\n\n196\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.060\nYou send something to your\nmailbox out front right?\n\n197\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.880\nYou are actually requesting a resource\n\n198\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.380\neven if you're sending\nit to the mailbox right?\n\n199\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.170\nWhat are you waiting on?\n\n200\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.880\nYou are waiting on the postal carrier,\nthe service they provide you,\n\n201\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.410\nto take that email or that mail and\nsend it across their network.\n\n202\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.300\nWell, that's essentially\nwhat SMTP is doing.\n\n203\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.850\nYou're forwarding,\nyou're sending email outbound,\n\n204\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.620\nyou're sending it to the server and\nthen it's the sever's job\n\n205\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.610\nto move it through the networks and\nget it to the end point..\n\n206\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.180\nDo remember the port two,\nthat's important.\n\n207\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.740\nI want you guys to know that,\nremember ports are how computers identify\n\n208\n00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.530\nthe type of service that is running and\nestablish where that end point is.\n\n209\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.262\nIt's part of the whole package.\n\n210\n00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:41.808\nAnd no problem intended talking about\nemail in the postal care as part of\n\n211\n00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:42.525\nthe package.\n\n212\n00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:43.893\n[LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.527\n&gt;&gt; It goes out on the port 25.\n\n214\n00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:51.239\nAnd we also have POP3 post\noffice protocol version three.\n\n215\n00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:54.435\nI don't know what happened to post\noffice version one or two but\n\n216\n00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:57.130\napparently the trilogy is where it's at.\n\n217\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:02.000\nPost office protocol version three\nnotice the arrow direction that's coming\n\n218\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.860\ninto your computer, that means I'm saying\nhey anybody out there got my email?\n\n219\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.920\nIn my inbox, I need it.\n\n220\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.440\nSo I'm gonna pull that\nemail down to my computer.\n\n221\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.280\n&gt;&gt; And not only that,\nit's not a copy, it's a move.\n\n222\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.240\n&gt;&gt; Your moving the mail that's on the POP3\nserver, to your client machine, correct?\n\n223\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.810\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\nI'm glad you mentioned that point, because\n\n224\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.060\nthat could be an exam alert, so you just\ngave them a good exam alert and a tip.\n\n225\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.750\nRemember that.\n\n226\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.920\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that,\nand we'll show the third one\n\n227\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.858\nhere in just a second, we are so used\nto being able to log in to Yahoo Mail,\n\n228\n00:11:37.858 --> 00:11:42.590\noutlook.com, Gmail,\nthat sometimes we don't think about it.\n\n229\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.920\nAnd if you're just getting\ninto the business,\n\n230\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.600\nmaybe you've never even seen this.\n\n231\n00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.030\nMaybe, you've never been in\nan enterprise environment at all.\n\n232\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.745\nBut can you imagine, let say,\nDan's my boss, sent me an email and\n\n233\n00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:59.880\nI'm at my work desk and I pull my email\ndown and like he said it moves it\n\n234\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.100\nto my local hard drive and\nit erases it off the server.\n\n235\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.060\nAnd then I go home and\nI try to check that email, it's gone.\n\n236\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.310\nThat is a scenario that they\ncould potentially give you.\n\n237\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.648\nSo what would you use?\n\n238\n00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:18.696\nAnd let me mention too email goes\nover that POP3 goes over port 110.\n\n239\n00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:24.308\nSo any configuration of that that they\nmight throw you, definitely know that.\n\n240\n00:12:24.308 --> 00:12:30.090\nSo what can we use to kinda avoid that\neventuality I guess if you are using POP3?\n\n241\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.740\nWell, that's where the last one comes in,\n\n242\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.060\nthis email type though its gonna be\na little bit something different.\n\n243\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.510\nThis is something known as IMAP, so\n\n244\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.430\nif we take a look at it,\nIMAP is the internet mail or messenger or\n\n245\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:47.400\nboth, Internet mail access protocol or\ninternet messenger protocol.\n\n246\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.440\nBut its better to say mail because we have\ndifferent types of messaging that we have\n\n247\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.750\nout there across Internet today.\n\n248\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.420\nNow, this is different in the fact that\nthis is probably one that if you have any\n\n249\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.130\nonline email system,\nyou're probably using right now, and\n\n250\n00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.140\nI would almost bet that you are.\n\n251\n00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.360\nBecause this allows you to connect\nto the server, through a web page.\n\n252\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.680\nAnd you basically manage\nyour email right there.\n\n253\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.920\nYou can create folders.\n\n254\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.770\nYou can drop.\n\n255\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.900\nYou can move, you can tag emails.\n\n256\n00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.482\nI can log out of my computer and\nI can go to another computer and\n\n257\n00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:20.270\nI could connect back to the IMAP server\nand guess what, everything is there.\n\n258\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.500\nAll my work's been saved, all the\nprogress, the folders, the arrangements,\n\n259\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.210\nthe tags that I've done.\n\n260\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.870\nAnd it allows me to log in\nfrom multiple locations.\n\n261\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.670\nSo one of the most common and prevalent\ntype of email systems that we use today.\n\n262\n00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.720\nThat is over port 143 and in\nthe accelerated track, let's go ahead and\n\n263\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.150\nmake mention of this just so\nit doesn't throw you off.\n\n264\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.706\nI remember as [INAUDIBLE] studying for\nan A+ exam and\n\n265\n00:13:45.706 --> 00:13:49.263\nNet+ as well,\nthere are some protocols that are so\n\n266\n00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:54.760\nclose together in the ports that they\nuse that you can get them confused.\n\n267\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:01.610\nThis is port 143 for\nIMAP do not confuse it with SSL port.\n\n268\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:07.920\nAnd the SSL port over HTTPS more\nspecifically, that's port 443.\n\n269\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.017\nSo they're close.\n\n270\n00:14:09.017 --> 00:14:09.628\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, get them right.\n\n271\n00:14:09.628 --> 00:14:13.989\n&gt;&gt; That's right because they\ncould just give you when you get\n\n272\n00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:18.530\na multiple choice answer,\nexcuse me, that you see 443.\n\n273\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.120\nYou see 143 and you see a crazy one.\n\n274\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.880\n&gt;&gt; Maybe 243 and 343, you don't know.\n\n275\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n276\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.670\nit's not that there is necessarily,\nthat they're trying to trick you up.\n\n277\n00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.070\nIt's just first of all are you paying\nattention, and do you know your ports.\n\n278\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.430\nSo the host other host email servers that\nyou could see out there even if you just\n\n279\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.590\ngenerically say mail servers.\n\n280\n00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.540\nWe also have things like print servers,\nand\n\n281\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.890\nkeep in mind when we talk about print\nservers I want you to think about\n\n282\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.160\na service being provided\nfrom another network host.\n\n283\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.150\nPrint servers come in all different\nshape and sizes all different flavors.\n\n284\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.470\nAnd can scale up to, from scaling down if\nyou will from the smallest just handling\n\n285\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.000\na couple of print jobs on the home network\nthrough things like air sharing or\n\n286\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.790\nair printing through Wi-Fi directive if\nyou will through near field communication.\n\n287\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.460\nAll the way to scaling up to large\n\n288\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.260\nprint servers that manage\nthousands of network printers.\n\n289\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.630\nAnd are handling all of the print jobs,\nagain basically, hey I need to print this.\n\n290\n00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.802\nThat's print jobs send over the network,\nand handling, and\n\n291\n00:15:22.802 --> 00:15:25.797\ncoordinating all of that, and\ncuing the way they need to.\n\n292\n00:15:25.797 --> 00:15:27.774\nStoring massive amounts\nof print drivers so\n\n293\n00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:32.000\nthat you can push them out to different\ndevices when they connect to them.\n\n294\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.830\nThe print server,\nunderstand its basic functionality.\n\n295\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.480\nIt manages the print queue.\n\n296\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.700\nIt manages the print drivers.\n\n297\n00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.850\nYou can do scheduling.\n\n298\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.240\nYou can do time of day restrictions on it.\n\n299\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.390\nIt is providing your print\nservices across your network.\n\n300\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.230\nAnd again they could be the smallest\ndevices that are really just as small as\n\n301\n00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.340\na Roku or an Apple TV.\n\n302\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.122\nRight up into a rack mount\nserver that's gonna be, like for\n\n303\n00:15:54.122 --> 00:15:56.361\ninstance we have our\nserver closet over there.\n\n304\n00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:57.553\nIt's gonna be in your server closet.\n\n305\n00:15:57.553 --> 00:16:00.770\nIt just depends on the scale,\nthe size that you need.\n\n306\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.796\nAll right.\nNow other things that we have too,\n\n307\n00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.167\nwe have things like basic file servers.\n\n308\n00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:09.637\nNow this is one that you could\nsee in a home network or a SOHO.\n\n309\n00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:14.482\nYou could see it In an enterprise level\nnetwork, we can talk about enterprise,\n\n310\n00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:19.475\nthe technologies behind it with things\nlike distributed file system replication\n\n311\n00:16:19.475 --> 00:16:24.320\nthat you have in Windows, it can get\nreally technical, and they usually use and\n\n312\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.803\non top of it you have Cloud based where\nthey get synchronized to the Cloud,\n\n313\n00:16:28.803 --> 00:16:30.370\npull information down.\n\n314\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.080\nBut really when we look at it,\nlet me go ahead and show you here,\n\n315\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.890\nthe file server is nothing more\nthan a place of storage unit.\n\n316\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.510\nIt's a storage unit to\nstore your information.\n\n317\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.040\nTechnically I guess you could say\na network-attached storage device could be\n\n318\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.660\nperforming the service of a file server.\n\n319\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.410\nRemember that we're essentially sharing\nresources like we've talked about on other\n\n320\n00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.290\nepisodes about the share,\nwhat a share is, what a shared resources.\n\n321\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.970\nWell, essentially, this allows\nyou to centralize your storage.\n\n322\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.790\nThis is a good centralized\nmanagement solution.\n\n323\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.036\nBecause if Dan stores his\nimportant files on his laptop,\n\n324\n00:17:08.036 --> 00:17:12.640\nI store my important files on my laptop,\nand let's multiply that times 100.\n\n325\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.070\nLet's multiply that times a 1,000,\nand guess what?\n\n326\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.180\nAny handful of those\ncomputers goes down and\n\n327\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.920\nwe don't have centralized management,\nI've got to find those computers.\n\n328\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.820\nAnd hope that I could\nrecover their information or\n\n329\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.610\nan administrator could set up\na shared location like this for\n\n330\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.530\nthe management team, the marketing team,\nthe dev team and say, you know what,\n\n331\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.520\nif you're gonna store your information,\nstored in the that location,\n\n332\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.580\nwe can map drives where it just basically\nlooks like a folder on the user's desktop,\n\n333\n00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.840\nthey don't even have to worry about\nthings like entering our UNC path.\n\n334\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.970\nThe universal naming convention backslash,\n\n335\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.150\nbackslash computer name\nbacklash share name.\n\n336\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:58.180\nSo it makes it a very, very good way\nto do centralized storage of your data.\n\n337\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.580\nAnd the other great thing that you\nget about this is that we can back up\n\n338\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.860\ninformation in a single location.\n\n339\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.400\nI don't have to worry about Dan,\ndid you back up your computer?\n\n340\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.370\nWes, you're a dummy, you haven't backed up\nyour computer in 29 days and guess what,\n\n341\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.400\nyou lost a file yesterday,\nand it's important.\n\n342\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.430\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n343\n00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.300\nThe administrator doesn't\nhave to worry about.\n\n344\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.170\nGuess what?\nWe're running scheduled backups on\n\n345\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.600\nthe File Server every single day.\n\n346\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.400\nSometimes maybe an hour early depending on\nthe criticality of that File Server and\n\n347\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.790\nif we lose information,\nI can get back to it again.\n\n348\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.440\nAnd even more so you can take\nit back it up to the clouds and\n\n349\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.650\nnow you've got even more protection,\nso great service to have.\n\n350\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.196\nSomething that you're gonna find common\nacross all the different networks.\n\n351\n00:18:39.196 --> 00:18:40.940\nSome of the other things that we have,\nproxies.\n\n352\n00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.440\nAnd let me take the forward proxy\nout of here because, again,\n\n353\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.910\nwe'll learn more about that when we\nget into Network+ and Security+.\n\n354\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.000\nJust understand that a proxy,\nthink about just the term proxy,\n\n355\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.620\nit's a middle man if you will and again\nwe're not forgetting our ladies out there,\n\n356\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.340\nit's in between some requests and\nthe delivery of that request.\n\n357\n00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.517\n&gt;&gt; I think technically a lawyer\nis considered a proxy.\n\n358\n00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:04.295\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n359\n00:19:04.295 --> 00:19:08.780\n&gt;&gt; So they speak for you on your behalf to\nthe judge, they understand the questions.\n\n360\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.630\nI speak with you and\n\n361\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.300\nthey are the ones, like you said, that\nmiddleman between you and the endpoint.\n\n362\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.000\n&gt;&gt; And I love that analogy of a lawyer.\n\n363\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.782\nSo now it just kinda dawned on me.\n\n364\n00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.342\nI don't know if you've seen it get\na little brighter back here, [LAUGH]-\n\n365\n00:19:20.342 --> 00:19:21.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.167\n&gt;&gt; Between the cut there.\n\n367\n00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:24.960\nLoan officer.\n\n368\n00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.510\nMy wife and I,\nwe're gonna be buying house.\n\n369\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.300\nI'm not talking to the people,\nthe big wigs, the CEOs of the bank.\n\n370\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.870\nI'm talking to a loan officer and\n\n371\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:38.210\nshe is basically negotiating on\nour behalf of what we need to get.\n\n372\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.160\nGreat way to put that.\n\n373\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.040\nI love the lawyer analogy.\n\n374\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.690\nSo how is a proxy applying to\nour networks, our network host?\n\n375\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.740\nWell, I want you to think about this.\n\n376\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.980\nWhen I visit a website,\nwhat is going on here?\n\n377\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.990\nWell, we'll talk about a web\nserver here in a second,\n\n378\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.490\nI'll show you a little bit more about it\nbut I'm making a request for a resource.\n\n379\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.360\nWhat's the resource?\n\n380\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.050\nThe webpage.\n\n381\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.880\nDan's got the webpage let's say\nit's his company I'm visiting.\n\n382\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.896\nOn that server that he's supporting,\nthere is a webpage and\n\n383\n00:20:04.896 --> 00:20:08.754\nI'm asking through my web browser,\nby connecting to it,\n\n384\n00:20:08.754 --> 00:20:12.946\nI need the HTML, and then,\nit delivers it back to my computer.\n\n385\n00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:16.090\nWhat if you wanted to secure access and\nyou wanted to say, you know what?\n\n386\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:21.510\nI still want you to be able to view\nthe Internet, but I wanna control it.\n\n387\n00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:27.120\nAnd even more so, I wanna kinda mask,\nI wanna obscure the fact that client 01,\n\n388\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.960\nlet's say that computer is the one\nthat's making the request.\n\n389\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.020\nSo instead of sending it directly to\nDan's web server there and waiting for\n\n390\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.080\nthe response,\nwe send it to that middleman, that proxy.\n\n391\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.760\nThe web proxy if you will.\n\n392\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.348\nAnd what happens is the request\ngoes to the web proxy and\n\n393\n00:20:45.348 --> 00:20:50.138\nthen the web proxy generates\na completely new request and\n\n394\n00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:54.846\nsends it out to the website\nthat you're trying to view.\n\n395\n00:20:54.846 --> 00:20:57.700\nAnd I'm just like you could see\ngiving some basic examples.\n\n396\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.970\nAnd then, that web page is then\ndelivered back to the proxy,\n\n397\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.830\nand the proxy does something kinda cool.\n\n398\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.900\nThe proxy actually caches this\ninformation, puts it down in that cache,\n\n399\n00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.640\nthat temporary storage, and delivers the\nweb request back to the original client.\n\n400\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.918\nNow, for\nsecurity purposes to the outside world,\n\n401\n00:21:16.918 --> 00:21:19.672\nlet's say we went to www.anysite.org.\n\n402\n00:21:19.672 --> 00:21:23.940\nIf you got a site out there called that,\nI apologize ahead of time.\n\n403\n00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.720\nI'm just making it up.\n\n404\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.712\n&gt;&gt; We're not trying to [CROSSTALK].\n\n405\n00:21:27.712 --> 00:21:29.141\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n\n406\n00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:30.570\nBut what's gonna happen?\n\n407\n00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.130\nSee to the rest of the world,\nnone of these computers exist,\n\n408\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.260\nnone of these internal\nclients actually exist.\n\n409\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:40.200\nIt's only the proxy that exist and the\nproxy is the one that's making the request\n\n410\n00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.710\nso from an attack perspective,\nfrom an obscure perspective,\n\n411\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.820\nyou don't even know the internal\nnetwork and the internal computers and\n\n412\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.540\nfrom an attack perspective,\nthey attacked the proxy not the client.\n\n413\n00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.140\nSo I can run anti-malware\nsoftware on the proxy and\n\n414\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.470\nI can get an extra layer protection and\n\n415\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.925\nthe fact that it was happening here is\nthey're actually being spam guarded.\n\n416\n00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:06.350\nThey're being checked for\nattachment malicious files and\n\n417\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.320\nstuffs before it ever goes\nback to my actual client.\n\n418\n00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.880\nThe other thing is we can control who\ngains the access, maybe these three people\n\n419\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.780\nare part of our development team and\nI want them to have access.\n\n420\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.440\nBut I've got a series of clients\nthat I support in another network or\n\n421\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.180\nmaybe the same network that we've\nkinda logically separated but\n\n422\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:27.100\nI don't want them to have access to the\nInternet, so I send them to the proxy and\n\n423\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.480\nI can control it in a single location,\n\n424\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.570\nthat's another great thing it's a single\nlocation that you can control that.\n\n425\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.974\nThe other thing too is this cache,\nthe cache is really cool too because you'd\n\n426\n00:22:35.974 --> 00:22:38.767\nalmost sometimes even\nspeed up functionality.\n\n427\n00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:41.969\nIf I've gone www.anysite.org\non Client 01 and\n\n428\n00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:46.288\nthen Client 02 turns around and\nwants to go to www.anysite.org,\n\n429\n00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:50.690\nthe proxy can check the cache and\nsay, I've got that in the list.\n\n430\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.080\nHere, you can just have it.\n\n431\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.454\nAnd now we don;t even need to\nmake outbound call at all and\n\n432\n00:22:54.454 --> 00:22:57.790\nthat might be good if you have\nsomething like bandwidth issues.\n\n433\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.390\nLimited bandwidth.\n\n434\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.047\nMaybe you're in a remote site\nthat is operating on a very,\n\n435\n00:23:03.047 --> 00:23:05.968\nvery slow connection\nthings like satellite.\n\n436\n00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.950\nI bet you wouldn't wanna have\nbusiness satellite connection.\n\n437\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But maybe you do.\n\n438\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.170\nWell, would it be nice if that page\nwas delivered from your local network\n\n439\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.170\nrather than having to go back out\nof the Internet and get it again?\n\n440\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:23.120\nSo proxies are a very, very good\nhost service that is provided to.\n\n441\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.170\nAnd that leaves me to one that I kinda\ntalked about already, the Web Server.\n\n442\n00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.450\nWhat's the Web Server doing?\n\n443\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.870\nWell, you guys probably know that\nthe Web Server essentially is,\n\n444\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.668\nit hosts your web pages.\n\n445\n00:23:36.668 --> 00:23:40.960\nAnd that's on the hard drive and\nyour client, if you will, in this case,\n\n446\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.688\nit's the software like your web browser\nis the client and it request a resource.\n\n447\n00:23:45.688 --> 00:23:49.851\nYou type out https://itpro.tv/block,\n\n448\n00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:55.186\nyou're making your request,\nthe URL, your more resource\n\n449\n00:23:55.186 --> 00:24:00.690\nlocators cuz I wanna see\nITPROTV's live feed right now.\n\n450\n00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.000\nAnd what is the Web Server doing?\n\n451\n00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.630\nYou connect to it.\n\n452\n00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.727\nIt says, well, let me look at\nwhat resource you're asking for.\n\n453\n00:24:04.727 --> 00:24:05.745\nOkay, I see that here.\n\n454\n00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:08.579\nLet me deliver it back\nto the web browser and\n\n455\n00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:13.937\nthen the web browser over HTTP Hypertext\nTransfer Protocol delivers that HTML,\n\n456\n00:24:13.937 --> 00:24:17.498\nthe Hypertext Markup Language,\nto the web browser.\n\n457\n00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:21.470\nAnd the web browser renders it,\nand you get the user experience.\n\n458\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.100\nI did want you to remember that HTTP and\nWeb browsers,\n\n459\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.700\nthey communicate primarily\nover two different protocols.\n\n460\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.030\nSo if it's unencrypted,\nHTTP traffic can support AD.\n\n461\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.479\nIf it is encrypted traffic,\nall right, HTTPS or\n\n462\n00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:38.621\nHTTP over secure socket layer,\nit's gonna be port 443, all right?\n\n463\n00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:41.223\nSo those are some of the printers\nthat we have, or excuse me,\n\n464\n00:24:41.223 --> 00:24:43.891\nsome of the network hosts that we have,\nand we have to look at.\n\n465\n00:24:43.891 --> 00:24:47.021\nBut there are also some other devices out\nthere that I just wanna kinda mention and\n\n466\n00:24:47.021 --> 00:24:47.860\nthrow in here, too.\n\n467\n00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.250\nBecause they can get a little\nconfusing sometimes, and\n\n468\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:58.256\nthat's something known as an IPS and\nsomething known as an IDS, all right?\n\n469\n00:24:58.256 --> 00:24:59.310\nSo what's the difference?\n\n470\n00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.560\nI just threw you a whole\n\n471\n00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.590\nbunch of alphabet soup\n&gt;&gt; One letter.\n\n472\n00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.188\n&gt;&gt; One letter.\n\n473\n00:25:03.188 --> 00:25:05.122\nSee, that's why we got Dan here, right?\n\n474\n00:25:05.122 --> 00:25:06.610\nI can't get anything past him.\n\n475\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.430\nNow joking aside, though, well what's\nthe main difference, all right?\n\n476\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, an IPS is an intrusion\nprevention system, and\n\n477\n00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.010\nan IDS is an intrusion detection system,\nall right?\n\n478\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.461\nWell, Wes, thanks you [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You really cleared up\n\n479\n00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:19.972\nthe water there, I appreciate it.\n\n480\n00:25:19.972 --> 00:25:21.970\n&gt;&gt; That cleared that up, right?\n\n481\n00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.255\nThat one letter, I got you,\nI got your back.\n\n482\n00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:25.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What happens is one is\n\n483\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.340\na passive device that's on your network,\na passive service.\n\n484\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.050\nThe other one is more proactive or\nactive host.\n\n485\n00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.240\nAnd what I mean that is your IDS,\n\n486\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.270\nit detects, it monitors, and\nit alerts you for signs of intrusion.\n\n487\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:44.230\nIt is also another device that's on\nyour network with other hosts, right?\n\n488\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.600\nNotice what's going on here.\n\n489\n00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.379\nThe IPS, a lot of times,\nthat functionality,\n\n490\n00:25:49.379 --> 00:25:54.880\nthe intrusion prevention system monitors,\ndetects, and alerts.\n\n491\n00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.250\nHere's where it separates itself,\nhere's where that one letter gets you.\n\n492\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.580\nPrevention part, is counter measures.\n\n493\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.060\nNot only do we detect something, but we\ncan implement a counter measure that stops\n\n494\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.570\nwhatever the intrusion is in its tracks.\n\n495\n00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.410\nHopefully that's the goal, all right?\n\n496\n00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.460\nIPS systems, a lot of times they're\nintegrated into your firewalls today.\n\n497\n00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.304\nSo they're doing more than one thing,\nright?\n\n498\n00:26:15.304 --> 00:26:17.760\nWe call it Unified Threat Management,\nright?\n\n499\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.010\nYou might even,\nthe exam objectives call out UTM.\n\n500\n00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:25.170\nThere's another term here that they don't\ncall out that if you're researching it,\n\n501\n00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.300\nand in Accelerated we expect\nyou to have some knowledge and\n\n502\n00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.050\ndo some research yourself,\nthen you might see the term USM.\n\n503\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.160\n&gt;&gt; It's Unified Security Management\nversus Unified Threat Management.\n\n504\n00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.800\nThey're one and the same,\nthey're in the same boat.\n\n505\n00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.313\nThey're shaking hands, okay?\n\n506\n00:26:37.313 --> 00:26:40.739\nAnd that just means that I have all\nof that functionality in a single\n\n507\n00:26:40.739 --> 00:26:41.786\nlocation, right?\n\n508\n00:26:41.786 --> 00:26:43.150\nAnd that goes a little bit farther.\n\n509\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.110\nNot just an IPS or IDS system.\n\n510\n00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.600\nAll of that functionality's built in.\n\n511\n00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.870\nBut then, we also have things like\nantivirus gateway, spam protection,\n\n512\n00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.710\nwe've got denial of service filters,\nright?\n\n513\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.970\nSo just everything all in a single box,\nright?\n\n514\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.335\nOne of the ones I think of, Dan, and\nI know that you've dealt with these a lot,\n\n515\n00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:04.565\nit's like the Cisco ASA devices,\nthe Advanced Security Appliances.\n\n516\n00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:09.835\nIts a firewall that has VPN concentration,\nit does intrusion prevention system.\n\n517\n00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:11.425\nIf you've got the money and\n\n518\n00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:14.745\nyou add some of the functionality\nyou can do even things like\n\n519\n00:27:14.745 --> 00:27:18.955\nnetwork based anti-malware scanning and\nstuff like that, staple packet inspection.\n\n520\n00:27:18.955 --> 00:27:21.740\nSo, all kinds of things wrapped\nup into a single device.\n\n521\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.120\nNow, last thing, and I know we're running\na little bit low on time on here, but\n\n522\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.800\nthe last thing I'd like to mention, Dan,\nare some legacy and embedded systems.\n\n523\n00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.960\nThat's really all they talk about,\nit's all they call out.\n\n524\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.250\nLet's define what we mean.\n\n525\n00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.040\nIn another episode, Dan and\nI went into pretty much\n\n526\n00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.260\nin a good bit of doubt about things\nlike threats and vulnerabilities.\n\n527\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.027\nAnd one of the things that we had\nmentioned there is that the fact that, for\n\n528\n00:27:45.027 --> 00:27:48.150\ninstance, there are worms\nout there on the Internet,\n\n529\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.680\nthat they'll be there forever, right?\n\n530\n00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.280\nWhy aren't they affecting us?\n\n531\n00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.770\nBecause we got systems that are up\nto date and are patched, all right?\n\n532\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.363\nThey only affect those old systems, right?\n\n533\n00:27:58.363 --> 00:28:03.130\nSystems that aren't patched, and\nthere isn't gonna be any more support.\n\n534\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.618\nThat's a legacy system,\na system that's out of date, all right?\n\n535\n00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:09.398\nNow, be careful there,\nespecially you guys out there and\n\n536\n00:28:09.398 --> 00:28:11.681\nmaybe gals that are into like old cars,\nright?\n\n537\n00:28:11.681 --> 00:28:12.820\nThat has nothing to do with it.\n\n538\n00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.706\nWhen I say, out of date,\n\n539\n00:28:13.706 --> 00:28:15.831\nI mean the fact that there is\nno more support for it, right?\n\n540\n00:28:15.831 --> 00:28:19.009\nThat's really what truly\ndefines a legacy system.\n\n541\n00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:22.263\nCuz you can have computers that are seven\nyears old, still run just fine if I can\n\n542\n00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:25.827\nput a new operating system on, it's not\nunderlying hardware even though it's old.\n\n543\n00:28:25.827 --> 00:28:29.133\nIt's the fact that their vendors\nare no longer supporting them, and\n\n544\n00:28:29.133 --> 00:28:31.586\nthat means that if attacks are found,\nguess what?\n\n545\n00:28:31.586 --> 00:28:33.258\nYou are on your own.\n\n546\n00:28:33.258 --> 00:28:34.854\nYou're walking the high wire and\n\n547\n00:28:34.854 --> 00:28:38.849\nthere's no net, and if you fall it's up to\nyou to figure out how to catch yourself.\n\n548\n00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:40.538\nGood luck.\n\n549\n00:28:40.538 --> 00:28:42.520\nEmbedded systems.\n\n550\n00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.520\nWe've got a lot of embedded systems today.\n\n551\n00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.560\nThere's more Android operating\nsystems running that you're probably\n\n552\n00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.960\nnot even aware of that it was an Android\noperating system running on that.\n\n553\n00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.650\nAnd you might not even\nown an Android phone.\n\n554\n00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.501\nYou might be married to iOS, right?\n\n555\n00:28:55.501 --> 00:29:00.349\nA lot of your GPS systems, not just GPS\nsystems, I mean your On Star systems,\n\n556\n00:29:00.349 --> 00:29:04.469\nyour navigation systems might be\nrunning things under the hood.\n\n557\n00:29:04.469 --> 00:29:09.086\nYour smart TVs,\nsmart refrigerators, I don't know.\n\n558\n00:29:09.086 --> 00:29:11.254\nIoT based devices,\nInternet of Things, right?\n\n559\n00:29:11.254 --> 00:29:12.302\nThese are embedded systems.\n\n560\n00:29:12.302 --> 00:29:13.694\nSCADA, right?\n\n561\n00:29:13.694 --> 00:29:17.765\nSupervisory Control Acquisition and\ndata Acquisition, I believe,\n\n562\n00:29:17.765 --> 00:29:19.843\nis the big long SCADA term, right?\n\n563\n00:29:19.843 --> 00:29:23.288\nThese are all little sensors and\nstuff, all connected to networks.\n\n564\n00:29:23.288 --> 00:29:25.650\nIP cameras, that's a big one, right?\n\n565\n00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:29.093\nIP cameras, they're running\nsoftware on them, and again,\n\n566\n00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:33.349\nthese can be systems that are always\nproviding a service, too, all right?\n\n567\n00:29:33.349 --> 00:29:36.012\nSo legacy systems, just understand\nthat they provide services but\n\n568\n00:29:36.012 --> 00:29:37.328\nthey provide vulnerabilities.\n\n569\n00:29:37.328 --> 00:29:40.472\nEmbedded systems,\nthere's tons of them out there, right?\n\n570\n00:29:40.472 --> 00:29:45.000\nWay, I mean, we could have a whole\nentire series on just, and\n\n571\n00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.710\nthey do, on just embedded systems.\n\n572\n00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.500\nBut keep in mind that a lot of\ntimes they're gonna be very unique.\n\n573\n00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.480\nWhere a lot of these have multi-vendor\nsupport and stuff like that and\n\n574\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.500\nall are like industry wide standards.\n\n575\n00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.348\nEmbedded systems aren't\nindustry wide standards, right?\n\n576\n00:30:00.348 --> 00:30:03.070\nEverybody's doing something unique.\n\n577\n00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.520\nSo just pay attention to\nwhat services provided.\n\n578\n00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.021\nThank goodness, I don't think\nthey're gonna ask you about any\n\n579\n00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:11.510\none specific vendor when it comes to\nembedded systems because of the fat\n\n580\n00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.520\nthat they try to remain\nin the vendor neutrality.\n\n581\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.190\nBut these are some of the hosts and\nthe services that you have running on your\n\n582\n00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.110\nnetwork, some of them are more popular\nones that we are talking about.\n\n583\n00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.760\nAnd be aware of them, right?\n\n584\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.785\nAs an A plus technician, if you're not\naware of even some of the basic networking\n\n585\n00:30:24.785 --> 00:30:28.754\nfunctionality, understand that you're\nprobably gonna deliver the computer\n\n586\n00:30:28.754 --> 00:30:31.138\nin a box and\nyou'll never take it out of the box.\n\n587\n00:30:31.138 --> 00:30:33.560\nYou're gonna be the delivery person for\nyour IT company.\n\n588\n00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.885\nYou gotta know networks,\nyou gotta know these services,\n\n589\n00:30:35.885 --> 00:30:37.270\nbecause you're gonna find them.\n\n590\n00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.308\nAnd regardless of SOHO,\nwhether it's a home user's network or\n\n591\n00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:45.870\nwhether it's a corporate enterprise\nnetwork, you gotta be aware, and\n\n592\n00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.037\nyou certainly gotta be aware for\nthat A Plus exam.\n\n593\n00:30:49.037 --> 00:30:49.567\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n594\n00:30:49.567 --> 00:30:52.975\nGreat overview, we appreciate you\ntaking the time to join us today and\n\n595\n00:30:52.975 --> 00:30:56.266\nshow us what we need to expect when\nit comes to those network hosts and\n\n596\n00:30:56.266 --> 00:30:58.380\nservices that are gonna be on our A+ exam.\n\n597\n00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.030\nReally good stuff, we appreciate it.\n\n598\n00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.890\nWe also appreciate our audience\nout there watching us everyday,\n\n599\n00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.580\ndiligently trying to prepare for\ntheir exam.\n\n600\n00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.960\nHopefully you've got a little more\nknowledge to equip you to do that.\n\n601\n00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.420\nBut looking at our clock,\nwe've run out of time for today.\n\n602\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.700\nWe do appreciate you for joining us,\nbut signing off, ITProTV,\n\n603\n00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.210\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n604\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n605\n00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.586\n&gt;&gt;

great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.930\nI'm host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.880\nit is all about our accelerated A+ series,\nIt has been a lot of fun so far.\n\n8\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.480\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, lending his expertise.\n\n9\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.490\nAs always, our good friend Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n10\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.588\nWes welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:33.056\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great and as you've seen\nyou know over the past couple of episodes\n\n12\n00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.524\nwe've been talking about other operating\nsystems and additional technology so\n\n13\n00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:39.894\nwe're going to get into some of the\nsdditional technologies in this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:43.449\nIn past episodes,\nyou'll see that we've been, well,\n\n15\n00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.908\nreally very Windows centric, right.\n\n16\n00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:48.156\nAnd we're Windows centric because well,\n\n17\n00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:52.095\nWindows still has a large portion\nof the market share right now.\n\n18\n00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:56.937\nThat is not as true as\nit was in earlier years.\n\n19\n00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:01.430\nWell actually, I would say it was more\ntrue in earlier years than it is today.\n\n20\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.000\nAnd that's why you can see CompTIA is\nincluding additional technologies.\n\n21\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.090\nI remember when I first\nstarted taking the A+ exam.\n\n22\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.220\nI think my series was 500 series, right.\n\n23\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.720\nAnd they didn't require you to know\nanything about your Mac operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200\nAnd they didn't require anything\nwithin Linux, let alone,\n\n25\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.710\nreally most of your mobile devices.\n\n26\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.560\nIn fact, what they were talking about\nis some of the other concepts, so\n\n27\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560\nwe've already addressed\nthings like laptops, right?\n\n28\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.470\nBut, as we've seen,\nthe years change up to the 900 series.\n\n29\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.330\nWe have a lot of different technologies.\n\n30\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.010\nWe have the buzzwords out there like BYOD,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.050\nBring your own device.\n\n32\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.810\nNow don't let that confuse you out there,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n33\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.952\nThat just means that we\nhave these devices, right?\n\n34\n00:01:42.952 --> 00:01:45.610\nAnd these devices are our own, right?\n\n35\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.100\nBYOD, bring your own device just means\nhey, I've already got a mobile device.\n\n36\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.347\nI'm familiar with it.\n\n37\n00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:53.200\nLet me use it inside\nthe corporate environment, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.180\nBut you also have\ncorporately-owned devices, too.\n\n39\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.902\nKeep in mind that might happen.\n\n40\n00:01:56.902 --> 00:02:00.663\nIn fact, my wife has a corporately-owned\ndevice, it's an iOS,\n\n41\n00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:02.150\nit's an iPhone, right?\n\n42\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.460\nAnd it's owned by ITProTV.\n\n43\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.570\nAnd she uses that as her primary\ncommunication technology, right.\n\n44\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.260\nSo you do have, you're seeing a lot of\nthese mobile devices inside of your\n\n45\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.360\nenvironment just like we talked about in\npast episode, you started seeing more and\n\n46\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.330\nmore prevalence of Mac and Linux.\n\n47\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.350\nSo it's good to see these\ntechnologies being covered and\n\n48\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.080\nrequired as an eight plus\ntechnician on the exam.\n\n49\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.390\nWe're gonna be looking more at\nthe mobile devices within this episode.\n\n50\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.610\nSo let's go ahead and let's kinda dive\nin here to what we've got to talk about.\n\n51\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.540\nWe've gotta talk about mobile\noperating systems, right?\n\n52\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.600\nNow, we've talked about mobile,\nthe actual components, before,\n\n53\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.190\nin basically 901-based objectives.\n\n54\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.140\nBut, remember with a Mobile OS,\n\n55\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.460\nwhat are things that that\nwe have to consider there?\n\n56\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.748\nWell we have to consider that a Mobile OS\nis a really streamlined operating system\n\n57\n00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:57.958\nand it is highly optimized for very small\nphone factor devices and there are a few\n\n58\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:03.273\ndifferent choices that we essentially\nhave available out there for us, right?\n\n59\n00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:07.395\nNow I'll tell you, two of the most common\nones and the ones that we're pretty much\n\n60\n00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:10.886\ngonna look at in this episode are going\nto be the iOS devices, right.\n\n61\n00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:14.835\nAs well as Android devices, but\nkeep in mind you have Apple's iOS,\n\n62\n00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:17.460\nbased operating system if you will.\n\n63\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.370\nYou also have the Android operating\nsystem originally started, I think\n\n64\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.240\nit was the Open Handset Alliance which\nwas the original manufacturers of it.\n\n65\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.050\nIt's based off the Linux kernel, right?\n\n66\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.430\nSo it has the Linux kernel in it's DNA,\nand then Google liked them so\n\n67\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.990\nmuch that they did like\na lot of big companies do.\n\n68\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.280\nThey went in and they bought it out and\n\n69\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.400\nit becomes essentially their, Google\nis the one that overseas Android today.\n\n70\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.614\nBut Microsoft,\na little bit later in the game.\n\n71\n00:03:41.614 --> 00:03:43.950\nIt's maybe not as common.\n\n72\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.010\nIt's out there for sure, but maybe not\nquite as common as iOS based devices and\n\n73\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.350\nAndroid devices.\n\n74\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.160\nWell, they have their,\ntheir Windows mobile operating system.\n\n75\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.400\nLike for instance Windows 7 mobile,\nWindows 8.1, mobile likewise too.\n\n76\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.347\nNow what we're gonna be basically focused\non today and through our mobile series,\n\n77\n00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:07.153\nare the two most popular ones, and again\nthat's iOS for things like your iPods,\n\n78\n00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:12.030\nyour iPhones, as well as android devices\nthat's come on a just various iPhones or\n\n79\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.532\nphones if you will as well as tablets too.\n\n80\n00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:18.684\nNow, there are some things to keep in mind\nwhen you are considering these operating\n\n81\n00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:22.599\nsystems and that being the fact that you\nhave what's known as an open source and\n\n82\n00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.820\nclosed source.\n\n83\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.024\nAll right, in other episodes, and\n\n84\n00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:26.552\nespecially when we\nare talking about Linux,\n\n85\n00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:29.122\nwe talk about one of the big things that\ndiffers Linux as far as license goes,\n\n86\n00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:31.813\nis that Linux, different from Mac,\nLinux is an open source piece of software,\n\n87\n00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.057\nwhich means that falls under\nsomething knows as the GPL, right?\n\n88\n00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:39.042\nThe GNU public licensing,\nlet's say, essentially the ability\n\n89\n00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:43.663\nto see the source code,\nto see the source code of the kernel,\n\n90\n00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:47.828\nbeing able to look at that code,\nmake revisions to it,\n\n91\n00:04:47.828 --> 00:04:52.268\nrepackage it,\nredistribute it without having any kind of\n\n92\n00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:57.540\nintellectual property violation,\ncopyright violation, right.\n\n93\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.040\nHowever, closed source, right, you can\nalso consider, a closed proprietory right.\n\n94\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.030\nThey say open source, closed source, but\nkeep in mind, closed source is gonna be\n\n95\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.210\nproprietory, and what that means is,\nit falls into what is called copyright.\n\n96\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740\nAnd copyright means that it isn't,\nthe code isn't open for\n\n97\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.690\nyou to basically reverse engineer and\nmake modifications to,yet and\n\n98\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.290\nrepackage it and then basically\nredistribute it at your leisure or\n\n99\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.185\nworse than that, make money off of it..\n\n100\n00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.510\nSo,you do understand that, right?\n\n101\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.270\nWe also have what's known\nas vendor's specific.\n\n102\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.860\nAnd when we talk about vendor's\nspecific we have Versions.\n\n103\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.270\nI like, for instance, Android, right?\n\n104\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.130\nYou have versions of Android that for the\nmost part, they follow the same kernel but\n\n105\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.920\nthey do have different bells and whistles\nthat are specific to the vendor himself.\n\n106\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.600\nSo for instance, you might see Samsung.\n\n107\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.219\nThis is a little bit different than for\ninstance like Google's, right.\n\n108\n00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.250\nFor instance Google has a group of pixels,\nand\n\n109\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.690\nI know that some of the functionality and\nfeatures within my Google pixel is not\n\n110\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.820\nthe same thing that I'm gonna find\ninside of a Samsung Galaxy, right.\n\n111\n00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.160\nWhen it comes to things like emergency\nnotifications, I have the way you\n\n112\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.800\nfind them in those operating systems\nare different, so I keep that in mind.\n\n113\n00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.510\nNow when you are working with\nyour Mobile Operating Systems,\n\n114\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.530\ntypically what you have is what\nis known as a launcher or a GUI.\n\n115\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.900\nAnd in fact, let's go ahead and\nshow you, right?\n\n116\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.606\nSo I've got a couple of different\nMobile Operating Systems.\n\n117\n00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:26.200\nYou'll see here on the left,\nwe've got our iOS device, right?\n\n118\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.630\nAnd this is essentially your\ngraphical user interface.\n\n119\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.730\nYou've got your touch screen, right,\nwhich is your touch interface.\n\n120\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.990\nNow, inside of things like your\nAndroid devices, you have the ability\n\n121\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.030\nto change things like, for instance,\nyour icons, if you will, your themes.\n\n122\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.400\nLike sometimes in Windows we\ncall things like themes, right?\n\n123\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.290\nWell, those launchers, essentially,\n\n124\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.100\nis a way to wrap it around\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n125\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.690\nAnd you can kinda, for instance, one that\nI like, and I don't have installed here.\n\n126\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.800\nYou can go into the, we'll talk\nabout the storage here in a second.\n\n127\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.730\nYou can make it look like it's\nthe Star Trek experience.\n\n128\n00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.983\nSo everything looks like it's\ngot a futuristic look to it.\n\n129\n00:07:03.983 --> 00:07:07.701\nThe icons kinda rotate around\nthemselves kinda like spinning gears.\n\n130\n00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:09.356\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So kinda like the light panels they had\n\n131\n00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:09.970\non the-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n132\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.650\n&gt;&gt; Enterprise or whatever.\n\n133\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.690\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n134\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.510\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like the deck of the starship-\n\n135\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.060\n&gt;&gt; I'll be right\n\n136\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.574\nback-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n137\n00:07:14.574 --> 00:07:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, they've got all different\n\n139\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.611\nkinds of ones if you want one that\nkinda makes it look like a mid-evil\n\n140\n00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:21.300\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah that's cool\n\n141\n00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.321\n&gt;&gt; Type interface, you can do that where\n\n142\n00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:26.740\nyour icons, scrolling,\nit kinda looks like scrolls, right?\n\n143\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.550\nYou know, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n144\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.895\n&gt;&gt; Again it depends,but mostly it's no\ndifferent than any other user experience.\n\n145\n00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:35.455\nPoint and\nclick technology SA point click literally.\n\n146\n00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.304\nBecause it is,\nI don't know if the clicking is there, but\n\n147\n00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:41.621\nit is a touch screen interface and\nyou're essentially operating or\n\n148\n00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.425\ninteracting with the operating system\nthrough a graphical user interface.\n\n149\n00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:48.925\n&gt;&gt; Wes, when you're, just to make sure\nthat I'm right on the same page with you,\n\n150\n00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:51.650\nwhen you say launcher slash GUI you mean.\n\n151\n00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.761\nThe environment which we\ncan launch an application.\n\n152\n00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Dan, that's absolutely correct.\n\n153\n00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.869\nI mean, when it comes down to it,\nthe GUI, launchers if you will,\n\n154\n00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:59.996\nit's how we're gonna interact\nwith the operating system.\n\n155\n00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:01.785\nIt's how we're gonna launch application.\n\n156\n00:08:01.785 --> 00:08:03.002\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nlet me show you here.\n\n157\n00:08:03.002 --> 00:08:06.332\nSo for instance, say if I'm gonna\nlaunch an application here,\n\n158\n00:08:06.332 --> 00:08:07.450\nI can do it in the GUI.\n\n159\n00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.561\nAnd just basically, touch interface here.\n\n160\n00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:12.710\nTouching the iPad launches an application.\n\n161\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.069\nNow, also notice here that I've kind of\nput one of those launcher applications\n\n162\n00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:21.428\nhere in the background while you were\ndiscussing that with our operating system\n\n163\n00:08:21.428 --> 00:08:22.620\nhere in the Android.\n\n164\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.355\nSo you can see that basically it's kind\nof changed, it just shut it down there.\n\n165\n00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.652\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of turns the theme in here, and\n\n166\n00:08:28.652 --> 00:08:32.192\nthis one in this case, it kind of\nputs the like this wolf background,\n\n167\n00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:35.639\nchanges all the icons, so\nthat essentially is what a launcher is.\n\n168\n00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:39.540\nLauncher versus GUI, it's really how we're\ngoing to interact with applications,\n\n169\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.030\nhow we're going to interact\nwith the Operating System.\n\n170\n00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.860\nNow, the next thing that we have to\ntalk about it what are known as,\n\n171\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.560\nwell, I've kind of mentioned\nthe applications themselves.\n\n172\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.510\nWhen it comes to applications,\nwe have some different app sources.\n\n173\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.330\nA lot of times we use the buzzword inside\nof your mobile operating system that\n\n174\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.760\nsays apps.\n\n175\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.360\nUnderstand apps, application, same thing.\n\n176\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.960\nHowever, they also mention SDK and APK.\n\n177\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.560\nAPK, what we're talking about,\n\n178\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.476\nthis is really essentially the,\nkind of like an executable.\n\n179\n00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:11.270\nWhen I'm going to install an application\ninside of a Windows device,\n\n180\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.590\nI use an .exe, the .exe file extension.\n\n181\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.520\nWell, inside of the Android\noperating system,\n\n182\n00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.660\nif you're going to download a file\nthat you're going to install, or\n\n183\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.340\nan application that you're going to\ninstall, it comes in the form of an APK.\n\n184\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.230\nSDK, that actually means Software\nDevelopment Kit, and you can see for\n\n185\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:33.090\ninstance if you want to allow\nyour Android phone to let's say,\n\n186\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.305\nconnect to your Windows desktop.\n\n187\n00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:40.130\nYou want to be able to send commands to\nit and between and get what's known as,\n\n188\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:47.300\nI think it's the Android Software\nDevelopment Kit, Android SDK.\n\n189\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.920\nRight, and that allows you to\ninstall tools like what's known as\n\n190\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.630\nthe Android Debugging Bridge and again,\nit allows you to communicate in between\n\n191\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.472\nthe device so, STK a lot of times used for\npretty much developers.\n\n192\n00:09:59.472 --> 00:10:04.260\nADK's are essentially the installer\nextension that we use to install\n\n193\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.850\napplications inside of\nan Android operating system.\n\n194\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.270\nNow, I talked about applications and apps.\n\n195\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.410\nWhere do we find those applications?\n\n196\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:11.996\n&gt;&gt; In the store.\n\n197\n00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:12.497\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:12.497 --> 00:10:13.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:14.210\n&gt;&gt; You know it's kind of interesting\n\n200\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.110\nthough-\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.661\nWindows actually calls theirs Store.\n\n202\n00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Store.\n&gt;&gt; Not The Store.\n\n203\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Not The Store.\n\n204\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.720\n&gt;&gt; Not Microsoft Store, but Store.\n\n205\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.120\nSo you are absolutely correct on that.\n\n206\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Each one of them have\ntheir own store type right?\n\n207\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.942\n&gt;&gt; They do,\nthey have what's known as Google Play,\n\n208\n00:10:27.942 --> 00:10:30.960\nGoogle Play is one of those\nones that you can use.\n\n209\n00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.510\nMy launcher's kind of got\nit looking a bit different.\n\n210\n00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.690\nSo, let me go ahead and change and\njust turn that launcher.\n\n211\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.730\nNow it's a wallpaper in the background,\nwhich is fine.\n\n212\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.190\nNotice that we have the Play Store here,\n\n213\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.980\nthis is a basically a place\nthat you could see.\n\n214\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.870\nThere's my theme there,\nif you will, or my launcher.\n\n215\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.720\nI was looking for launcher applications.\n\n216\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.660\nBut this is essentially the way that we\ncan log into with our Google account or\n\n217\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.260\nGoogle ID, if you will, same thing\nyou log in with Gmail and stuff, and\n\n218\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.270\nyou can gain access to Google Play.\n\n219\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:05.160\nIf you're in the iOS space devices,\nyou have what is known as the App Store.\n\n220\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.110\nAnd if you have your Apple ID signed in,\nthen essentially what you can\n\n221\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:16.020\ndo is you can go to the App Store here and\nyou can download all of your applications.\n\n222\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.700\nYour application updates come from here.\n\n223\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.080\nYou can kind of see this\ndown in the bottom here.\n\n224\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.860\nNotice categories, charts or\ntop of the charts, purchased, and updates.\n\n225\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:30.150\nSo it's a good cloud based solution when\nit comes to downloading your applications.\n\n226\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.920\nNow we also have what are known as,\nvirtual assistants.\n\n227\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.280\nThings that allow our experience,\n\n228\n00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.520\nif you will, we can interact with\nour device a little bit easier.\n\n229\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.270\nNow whether you like these,\nsome people absolutely swear by them.\n\n230\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.730\nOther people, and\nyou can't see it right now-\n\n231\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.775\n&gt;&gt; I actually swear at them.\n\n232\n00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:47.597\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\n\n233\n00:11:47.597 --> 00:11:49.570\nDan's over here shaking his\nhead in the background.\n\n234\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.800\n&gt;&gt; I hate these things.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and these virtual assistants,\n\n235\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.350\nas they call them, we have them\nin each of the operating systems.\n\n236\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.430\nWe have for instance by default,\n\n237\n00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.270\nwell actually the one that you have\ninside of you iOS devices is Siri, right?\n\n238\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.220\n&gt;&gt; Are there other virtual assists for\nApple products?\n\n239\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.840\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n240\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.990\nThat would probably cause\na conflict of interest.\n\n241\n00:12:09.013 --> 00:12:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Apple, in and\n\n242\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.850\nof themselves, they're so\nclosed source with everything,\n\n243\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.030\nthey like to control just about\nevery aspect of the experience.\n\n244\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.160\nSo I'm not sure if there\nis off the top of my head.\n\n245\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.400\nNow Android on the other hand,\nthey've got quite a few.\n\n246\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they do.\n&gt;&gt; And I just labelled some of them.\n\n247\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.490\nOk Google is the one that's on my Pixel,\nGoogle Allo [LAUGH] is one of them.\n\n248\n00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.410\nGoogle Now, there's also Hound.\n\n249\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.840\nYou mentioned one as well, right?\n\n250\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the new one for\nSamsung devices is Bixby.\n\n251\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.060\n&gt;&gt; Bixby, okay.\n\n252\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, there we go, you got an example.\n\n253\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.880\nThere are a whole bunch of them.\n\n254\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.720\nInside of the Windows Mobile\noperating systems, you have Cortana.\n\n255\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.955\nYou out there that are Halo players\nprobably recognize Cortana from Halo.\n\n256\n00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:54.230\nWell, she or it, if you will,\nis the virtual assistant\n\n257\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.460\ninside of those operating systems,\nthe Windows Mobile operating systems.\n\n258\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.080\nSome of the features that we have\ninside of your operating systems,\n\n259\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.462\nyou have what is known as\nscreen orientation, and\n\n260\n00:13:04.462 --> 00:13:07.835\nyou have essentially what's\nknown as screen calibration.\n\n261\n00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:11.140\nNow, kind of interesting today, there's\nnot a lot of calibration that you can\n\n262\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.030\nreally do so\nmuch to these devices any more.\n\n263\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.466\nI can't tell you the last time I'm\nactually had to calibrate a screen.\n\n264\n00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:21.320\nHowever screen orientation is something\nthat you might need, in fact,\n\n265\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.540\nI can kind of show you.\n\n266\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.710\nRemember screen orientation is just,\nwhat rotation,\n\n267\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.530\nlike what location,\nhow are you viewing the phone?\n\n268\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.400\nAre you doing it in like a landscape\nview versus like a portrait view?\n\n269\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.434\nAnd you can see right here that this would\nsimulate, if you will, me just basically\n\n270\n00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:42.370\ntaking the phone and turning it on\nits side there, for that direction.\n\n271\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.880\nSo, again, screen orientation,\ncalibration, again, like I said,\n\n272\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.990\nyou don't really do too\nmuch calibration anymore.\n\n273\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.730\nThere are some tools that are built\ninto your mobile operating systems\n\n274\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.960\nthat could potentially allow you to\ncheck and diagnose the screen, but\n\n275\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.140\nas far as calibration goes that's\ntypically built into the operating system.\n\n276\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.156\n&gt;&gt; Now, what's for the exam?\n\n277\n00:14:01.156 --> 00:14:03.950\nAre they going to ask us\nhow we calibrate a screen,\n\n278\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.870\nor what kind of questions might we\nencounter when it comes to that?\n\n279\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.300\n&gt;&gt; You know, when it comes to\nthe screen they might ask you what\n\n280\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.120\nare the technologies\nbehind the screen itself?\n\n281\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.770\nAnd that would be something\nknown as the accelerometer and\n\n282\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.440\nsomething known as the gyroscope.\n\n283\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.740\nBut again, accelerometer,\nyou've seen the screen orientation,\n\n284\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.820\nhow it went from portrait\nview to landscape view there.\n\n285\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.089\nWell, that's something that\nthe accelerometer helps.\n\n286\n00:14:25.089 --> 00:14:28.080\nIt lets you know basically\nthe screen rotation, but\n\n287\n00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.700\nit doesn't really do really\ngood inside of a 3D space.\n\n288\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.430\nSo do I, am I tipping the phone?\n\n289\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.390\nI can change the orientation, but\n\n290\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.210\nam I tipping the phone,\nam I rocking it front to back?\n\n291\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.690\nAnd that's where the gyroscope comes in.\n\n292\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.600\nYou do have some other kinds of\nsensors that are in there as well.\n\n293\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.850\nYou have things like a barometer\nthat can actually- What is that,\n\n294\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.210\naltitude I believe is the barometer,\nright, shows you the altitude?\n\n295\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.350\n&gt;&gt; That's the altimeter.\n\n296\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.860\nAltimeter.\n\n297\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Excuse me,\n\n298\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.130\nthat was the altimeters, thank you.\n\n299\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.196\nHence the name right, altimeter.\n\n300\n00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:57.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's other things\n\n301\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.180\nthat they have too, being able to,\nthermal temperature sensors,\n\n302\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.140\nhumidity sensors,\nproximity sensors, light sensors.\n\n303\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.150\nSo believe it or not,\nyour smartphone is really, really smart.\n\n304\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.935\nThere’s a lot of sensors built into it.\n\n305\n00:15:09.935 --> 00:15:11.845\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; How do you say magnometer?\n\n306\n00:15:11.845 --> 00:15:12.896\n&gt;&gt; A magnetometer?\n\n307\n00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:17.552\n&gt;&gt; A magnetometer, or, it basically-\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one.\n\n308\n00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:18.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you.\n\n309\n00:15:18.915 --> 00:15:19.757\n&gt;&gt; Magneto ometer.\n\n310\n00:15:19.757 --> 00:15:22.228\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we're going X-Men, that's right.\n\n311\n00:15:22.228 --> 00:15:24.730\nIn fact, I'll tell you what,\nlet me go ahead and show you,\n\n312\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.095\nthere's a way that you can see\nsome of these sensors here,\n\n313\n00:15:27.095 --> 00:15:32.060\nbecause for the life of me I can't\npronounce that one to save my life.\n\n314\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.000\nAnd this is a little code\nthat you can launch and\n\n315\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.130\nbasically launches the field\nservice screen here too.\n\n316\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.900\nAnd you can see that's\n\n317\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.360\nsome of the different sensors\nthat you have inside of it.\n\n318\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.530\nThere's your accelerometer, and\nyou can do a test of the accelerometer.\n\n319\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.740\nProximity sensor, barometer is there,\npressure test, altitude.\n\n320\n00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.220\nWell see, and that's what I thought,\nit's weird that the barometer actually is\n\n321\n00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.625\ntesting altitude here-\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm guessing the barometric\n\n322\n00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:00.900\npressure changes as you rise or fall-\n&gt;&gt; From sea level.\n\n323\n00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.495\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n324\n00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:06.015\nThat's why that one kind of throws me off,\nis that I know in a phone that's what it's\n\n325\n00:16:06.015 --> 00:16:09.260\ndoing but that's certainly not what\nyou're going to use on a plane, right?\n\n326\n00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.725\nBut light sensor, as you can see down\nhere if we show the different sensors\n\n327\n00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:17.483\nright here you can see gyroscope,\nmagnetic sensor, right?\n\n328\n00:16:17.483 --> 00:16:19.230\nAgain, I don't know exactly.\n\n329\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.333\nThere's a-\n&gt;&gt; Neither do they,\n\n330\n00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:22.200\nthat's why they wrote magnetic sensor,\nright?\n\n331\n00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n332\n00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:27.665\nthis is in combination with like\nyou GPS systems, knowing magnetic,\n\n333\n00:16:27.665 --> 00:16:32.560\nthe polarity of the earth if you will,\nthe net magnetic pull of the earth.\n\n334\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.362\n&gt;&gt; The magnetometer is very important.\n\n335\n00:16:34.362 --> 00:16:36.528\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n336\n00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:40.966\n[LAUGH] And if you think about it,\nwhat happens if I hold my phone,\n\n337\n00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.707\nlike in landscape mode.\n\n338\n00:16:42.707 --> 00:16:45.498\nAnd I tilt it one way,\nwell now the accelerometer and\n\n339\n00:16:45.498 --> 00:16:49.830\nthe gyroscope are working, but in spatial\nmovement, I'm not going anywhere.\n\n340\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.230\nWell, can you tell me what position I am,\ncuz the GPS could kinda get a little\n\n341\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.590\nbit off there, but if we know what\nthe magnetic pole of the device is,\n\n342\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.740\nthen we can tell, is it facing north,\nis it facing south, right?\n\n343\n00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.940\nSo, again all of these things\nkind of work together to\n\n344\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.250\nreally give you a pretty\nsmart device there.\n\n345\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.080\nSpeaking of that, I mentioned GPS.\n\n346\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.770\nGPS is something that we have to\nknow a little bit about, right?\n\n347\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.570\nThat's in combination with\nthings like geo tracking.\n\n348\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.090\nIf you've ever done on social media and\n\n349\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.320\nyou posted, maybe out there in Facebook,\nyou post something and it says,\n\n350\n00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.510\nhey, this was posted from West Side Park\nor whatever the heck that might be.\n\n351\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.420\nMine always says that.\n\n352\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.560\nApparently West Side Park is the name\nof the park across my street.\n\n353\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.550\nI've lived there for five years.\n\n354\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.120\nI never knew it.\n\n355\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.760\nThanks, Facebook.\n\n356\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.302\nI appreciate you help me out there.\n\n357\n00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:36.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But geotracking right?\n\n358\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.890\nIt's just taking GPS, right?\n\n359\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.990\nIt's where you're at.\n\n360\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.640\n&gt;&gt; And that's how you do things like,\nI'm checking in at ITPro.TV studio's.\n\n361\n00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.290\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n362\n00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.090\n&gt;&gt; You wanted to come here and\nthat would show up there.\n\n363\n00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, geolocation.\n\n364\n00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n365\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.085\n&gt;&gt; So you have a lot of different,\ngeotracking.\n\n366\n00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:53.050\nYou're tracking the geolocation, [LAUGH].\n\n367\n00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, it's got really all\n\n368\n00:17:54.011 --> 00:17:55.180\nworking together here.\n\n369\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.560\nAnd in fact some of you maybe go on\nto more advanced technologies, right?\n\n370\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.190\nMaybe go into our security plus series\nwhere we talk about geofencing, right?\n\n371\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.130\nThe ability of a mobile device\nplatform to be able to say okay\n\n372\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.640\nyou're within proximity of this\nnetwork which means, In the building,\n\n373\n00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.990\nmaybe it's a large building, right?\n\n374\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.955\nMaybe you're out there at Redmond which,\n\n375\n00:18:13.955 --> 00:18:17.240\nthey have an entire city that's\nessentially a single campus, right.\n\n376\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.656\nAnd because you're in this portion,\nright, we can say, okay,\n\n377\n00:18:20.656 --> 00:18:23.155\nyou have access to these\ndifferent resources.\n\n378\n00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:25.655\nBut the moment you walk out of\nthat proximity, guess what,\n\n379\n00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:29.005\nanother policy applies, and it doesn't\nallow you access to those resources,\n\n380\n00:18:29.005 --> 00:18:30.420\nbasically geofencing, right?\n\n381\n00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n382\n00:18:31.134 --> 00:18:33.970\n&gt;&gt; It's a cool security implementation.\n\n383\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.810\nOther things that you might have,\nthe ability to do is things like Wi-Fi\n\n384\n00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.330\ncalling or remember that you\nhave cellular communications.\n\n385\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.910\nAnd we'll talk a little bit\nmore about wireless and\n\n386\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.810\nstuff in another episode coming up.\n\n387\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.775\nBut do keep in mind that you\nhave things like Wi-Fi calling.\n\n388\n00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:50.244\nAnd Wi-Fi calling is kind\ninteresting in the fact that,\n\n389\n00:18:50.244 --> 00:18:52.430\nif I don't want my cellular.\n\n390\n00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Hold on there Wes,\nyou're me that I can make a phone call\n\n391\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.490\neven if I'm not in data\nI can just use Wi-Fi.\n\n392\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.620\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and like I was gonna\nsay is that the fact that it can\n\n393\n00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.780\nhelp save some of your data,\nyour cellular plan, right?\n\n394\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.150\nEspecially when it comes to data, you\nmight have a certain amount of talk time.\n\n395\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.260\nA lot of times we have unlimited data so\nit's not as maybe not as common.\n\n396\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.790\nMight help you on a TracFone if it's\none of those turn and burn phones,\n\n397\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.080\nbut that's right, you can.\n\n398\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.470\nAnd let me show you where\nyou could see that.\n\n399\n00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.220\nSo if I get down in here\ninto my Android device, and\n\n400\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.730\nI got to Settings and\nit's typically in Wi-Fi.\n\n401\n00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.189\nYou'll see down here at the bottom\nwe have, that isn't it.\n\n402\n00:19:31.189 --> 00:19:32.520\nI'm sorry, I lied to you.\n\n403\n00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.490\nHow about More Networks, there?\n\n404\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.292\nWe'll try to get to the right spot there.\n\n405\n00:19:36.292 --> 00:19:38.550\nAnd you can see at the bottom,\nnotice Wi-Fi Calling.\n\n406\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.260\nNow keep in mind that if\nyou have Wi-Fi Calling,\n\n407\n00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.720\nthis doesn't mean that you get\nto bypass the carrier, right?\n\n408\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.520\nI can't just turn this on and say well,\nI don't need a carrier anymore,\n\n409\n00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.710\nI don't need a cellular network.\n\n410\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.573\nIn fact If I turn this on, you might see,\nit should error out on me.\n\n411\n00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:54.907\nI'm gonna see, it might.\n\n412\n00:19:54.907 --> 00:19:57.350\nThere we go, so notice it says,\nthere's an error there.\n\n413\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.480\nLet me save you, you don't have\nto worry about that for the exam.\n\n414\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.520\nBut the error just basically\nmeans no cellular connection,\n\n415\n00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.020\nyou don't get to use Wi-Fi calling.\n\n416\n00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.770\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n417\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.920\nNow [LAUGH] I'm kinda\nlooking at our list and\n\n418\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.350\nthere are quite a few more things that we\nwanna talk about in our mobile devices.\n\n419\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.313\nI wanna kinda wrap up some more\nfeatures that we have, and\n\n420\n00:20:15.313 --> 00:20:19.354\nwe've got some additional security\nfeatures that we want you to be aware of.\n\n421\n00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:21.990\nBut it does look like we're gonna\nhave to save that for a part two.\n\n422\n00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, not a problem,\n\n423\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.870\nwe can definitely roll that into\na part two without an issue.\n\n424\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.970\nHopefully, we'll see you guys there.\n\n425\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.460\nWes, thanks for dropping by.\n\n426\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.690\nWe thank our audience for watching.\n\n427\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.333\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n428\n00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:32.550\nI've been you host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n429\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.350\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n430\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.639\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n431\n00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:41.755\n[MUSIC]\n\n432\n00:20:41.755 -->

Coming to you live from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:07.373\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.189\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n8\n00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.850\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.000\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.940\nAnd in today's episode, we are back\nwith more in our A+ Accelerated Series.\n\n11\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.450\nJoining us back in the studio,\nyou know him, you love him.\n\n12\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.800\nHe's our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.410\nWes, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.320\n&gt;&gt; Man, going great.\n\n15\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.176\nGreat to be here, and that's right,\n\n16\n00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.909\nwe are continuing on part two\nabout our mobile devices.\n\n17\n00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.704\nThe first part we started to introduce you\nto some of the operating systems that you\n\n18\n00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.080\ncan expect to see on the exam.\n\n19\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.110\nAs well as, well,\na couple of the different features.\n\n20\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.880\nReally when we talk about\nthings like launchers,\n\n21\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.710\nand GUIs, and virtual assistants,\nand the app source.\n\n22\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.429\nApp sources, if you will,\ndefinitely check those out.\n\n23\n00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.231\nAnd if you are not aware of them,\ncheck part one out and come back here and\n\n24\n00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.060\njoin us in part two.\n\n25\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.500\nBut we're gonna continue\non in the features.\n\n26\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.570\nAnd let's go ahead, well, we'll just\npick up right where we left off.\n\n27\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.610\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about,\nwell, cellular wireless and Bluetooth.\n\n28\n00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.810\nWe're gonna talk about our\ncommunication types that we have.\n\n29\n00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.060\nKeep in mind that if you're connected\nto a cellular network today,\n\n30\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.730\nyou have a few choices.\n\n31\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.520\nYou have what's known as GSM,\nGlobal System Mobiles.\n\n32\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.380\nYou also have LTE, the Long Term\nEvolution, which is your 4G technology.\n\n33\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.290\nKinda won over in the whole 4G race,\nif you will.\n\n34\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.315\nThere's also wireless interoperability for\nmicrowave access Wimac,\n\n35\n00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:31.187\nit is out there but LG, excuse me not LG,\nbut LT is definitely one out.\n\n36\n00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:35.920\nI want you to keep in mind also that\nyou also have CDMA, UTMS, if you will.\n\n37\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.240\nThese are the technologies that you have\nwith inside of the operating systems.\n\n38\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.880\nNow, really when it comes down to it,\n\n39\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.680\nthat's gonna be whoever the carrier is\nthat you get your phone from, right?\n\n40\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.870\nThis isn't something that really you\nget to pick and choose too much.\n\n41\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.810\nIt is really dependent on whatever\nthe cell carrier provides you with, right?\n\n42\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.170\nSo for instance,\nI'm on an LTE-based network with Verizon.\n\n43\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.798\nDan, you got AT&amp;T, right?\n\n44\n00:01:57.798 --> 00:02:00.249\nSo I can only imagine\nthey're an LTE-based network.\n\n45\n00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:01.930\n&gt;&gt; I do believe they are, yes.\n\n46\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I believe, for instance,\nCDMA is one of the older technologies,\n\n47\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.070\nand I believe Verizon still\nsupports that as well.\n\n48\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.220\nSo a couple of the different\ntechnologies that you have.\n\n49\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220\nAnd that kinda lends itself to some of\nthe other things that we wanna kinda\n\n50\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.630\nkeep in mind, when it comes to cellular\ncommunications and these mobile devices.\n\n51\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.733\nI wanna go ahead and\ntalk about something known as an IMEI.\n\n52\n00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:28.291\nAnd I'm gonna get these acronyms wrong,\nI tell you, just because, well,\n\n53\n00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:29.657\nthey're a mouthful.\n\n54\n00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:34.030\nIMEI, that is the International\nMobile Equipment Identifier.\n\n55\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.135\nIt's a 64-bit identifier\nexpressed in 15 characters.\n\n56\n00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:38.264\nIt depends on the standard.\n\n57\n00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:41.950\nThe earlier standard was 15 characters,\na lot of times you still see it\n\n58\n00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.656\nrepresented in 15 characters,\nbut it could be 15, 16, or 17.\n\n59\n00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:50.341\nAnd that's because, well, like any other\nstandard, the standards evolved over time.\n\n60\n00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:55.872\nAnd again, the 15 characters standard,\nit really does a couple of things.\n\n61\n00:02:55.872 --> 00:03:00.785\nIt uniquely identifies\nthe manufacturer of your device, and\n\n62\n00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:05.990\nit also uniquely defines the device,\nthe unique device itself.\n\n63\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.540\nSo if we compare it to something\nlike MAC addresses, right?\n\n64\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.165\nA MAC address is a 48-bit address\nexpressed in 6 bytes, typically,\n\n65\n00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:13.770\nright; in the first 3 bytes.\n\n66\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.096\nIt's called the Organizationally\nUnique Identifier, right?\n\n67\n00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:19.214\nThat's the OUI that says hey,\nthis is an Intel adapter or\n\n68\n00:03:19.214 --> 00:03:20.592\nthis is a Broadcom adapter, right?\n\n69\n00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:24.770\nVersus any the other\nadapters that are out there.\n\n70\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.520\nGigabyte has their own.\n\n71\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.440\nVMware has their own.\n\n72\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.782\nSo it identifies the adapters uniquely,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:29.782 --> 00:03:32.390\nAnd the last 3 bytes of a MAC address,\nwhat do they do?\n\n74\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.170\nThey identify, well, that adapter\nitself within the manufacture.\n\n75\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.150\nWell, that's what the IMEI also does, but\nit uniquely identifies the device itself,\n\n76\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.590\nif you will, inside of the mobile device.\n\n77\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.376\nAnd in fact, let me go ahead and\ntake a second here, and I'll show you,\n\n78\n00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:49.170\nwhere you can see something like that\ninside of your operating system.\n\n79\n00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.430\nSo for instance, now,\nI'm not gonna show you on the iPad,\n\n80\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.680\ncuz the iPad isn't currently\nconnected up to any cellular network.\n\n81\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.350\nBut I will show you that, for instance,\nif I get into the app locker here.\n\n82\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.740\nOr actually, let's just go to settings.\n\n83\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.860\nAnd then what we're gonna do is,\n\n84\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.630\nby default,\nyou usually see that it'll be connections.\n\n85\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.600\nThis'll be where you start out.\n\n86\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.810\nIt was already focused on More.\n\n87\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.420\nBut you'll go to the More option here.\n\n88\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.355\nAnd when you go to More, if you scroll\nall the way down to the bottom,\n\n89\n00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:19.790\nyou'll see that there's About device.\n\n90\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.780\nYou might see something like About phone,\nit depends again, how they label it.\n\n91\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.820\nBut About device, if you look in here and\n\n92\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.830\nyou scroll down,\nit tells you what the baseband version is.\n\n93\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.965\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about that,\n\n94\n00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:33.780\ncuz that's definitely something\nthat you need to keep in mind too.\n\n95\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.060\nAnother concept called PRI and\nPRL Updates.\n\n96\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.650\nBut we'll get into those in just a second.\n\n97\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.191\nWhat I'm really worried about\nis the status bar here.\n\n98\n00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:48.071\nAnd when I say statusbar, understand I'm\nnot talking about how many bars you have\n\n99\n00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.265\nas far as downloads, or\nwhat the signal strength is.\n\n100\n00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:55.784\nBut if I choose Status right here, you'll\nnotice that there is what's known as\n\n101\n00:04:55.784 --> 00:04:59.641\nan IMEI, that's an International\nMobile Equipment Identifier.\n\n102\n00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:02.080\nAnd you can see there\nare 15 characters here.\n\n103\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.910\nNow the reason I say that, sometimes it\nmight be expressed in 17 characters is\n\n104\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.190\nbecause they added a later\nextension to this.\n\n105\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.830\nAnd if we can show that screen one more\ntime, you'll see that there is, and\n\n106\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.510\nthis is the extension to\nkinda like the standard.\n\n107\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.780\nI believe it's\nan organization called 3GPP.\n\n108\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.450\nSo 3rd Generation Partnership Project,\nif you will.\n\n109\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.560\nThey're the one ones that oversee LTE\nstandards, 3G standards, 4G standards.\n\n110\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.360\nAnd what they said is, we'll add a 16th or\n\n111\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.500\na 17th character, and that'll show\nyou what the software version is.\n\n112\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.830\nAnd that's all that stands for.\n\n113\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.480\nIt's IMEI, or International Mobile\nEquipment Identity Software Version.\n\n114\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.910\nSo now, not only can we tell you what\nmanufacturers it is, uniquely identifying\n\n115\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.500\nit within the manufacturer, but you can\nalso tell what software version it is.\n\n116\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.710\nAnd why does this come into play?\n\n117\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.530\nWhy would they actually put\nsomething like this on the exam?\n\n118\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.630\nCuz you say, well,\nthat's really technical,\n\n119\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.820\nwhy would they do something like that?\n\n120\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.427\nWell, you should know that that's\nthe way carriers will identify your\n\n121\n00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:02.279\ndevice when it connects to their networks.\n\n122\n00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:06.611\nNow, there's something else, and that's\ncalled the other thing that's in the list\n\n123\n00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:10.250\ntoo, that's the IMSI,\nInternational Mobile Subscriber ID, right?\n\n124\n00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.860\nSo within the mobile network, right.\n\n125\n00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.330\nOnce you join it, right,\nthey can recognize your device uniquely.\n\n126\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.660\nThey can tell it's a Samsung,\nit's a google Pixel.\n\n127\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.450\nThey can tell uniquely the device,\nbecause there is thousands,\n\n128\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.070\nhundreds of thousands of\nGoogle Pixels out there.\n\n129\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.038\nThere’s hundreds of\nthousands of Galaxy S8s,\n\n130\n00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:28.104\nhow do I uniquely tell that this is Dan's,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:30.056\nWell, part of that, IMEI.\n\n132\n00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:36.590\nBut when Dan connects to his network, or\nlet's say we both have Galaxy S8s, right?\n\n133\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.380\nAnd we both connect tot he same network,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.890\nWell, how does the carrier\nidentify uniquely that that's Dan,\n\n135\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.090\nand here is Dan's information, and\nthis is Wes, and Wes' information?\n\n136\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.523\nWell, that's where the other\nidentifier comes in.\n\n137\n00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:54.889\nThe IMSI, the International\nMobile Subscriber Identity,\n\n138\n00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.520\nthat's how your carrier identifies\nyou when you connect to your network.\n\n139\n00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.540\nAnd then as you hop through their\ndifferent cell locations, they use it.\n\n140\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.130\nAnd the cell towers will actually\npass that information off,\n\n141\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.071\nas you hop from cellular\ntower to cellular tower.\n\n142\n00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:12.850\nI don't know that you'll\never worry too much,\n\n143\n00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.680\nunless maybe you get into\nthat field about the IMSI.\n\n144\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.580\nBut the IMEI, you might,\nbecause this is also\n\n145\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.400\nthe number that they use to block\ndevices from joining their network.\n\n146\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.500\nAnd why would you say, well,\n\n147\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.530\nwhy would we block a device from\njoining our network, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.740\nWell, I'm the thief here,\nright, not really-\n\n149\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:31.324\n&gt;&gt; But I'm the thief, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:32.843\n&gt;&gt; Was got a bag of phones [CROSSTALK].\n\n152\n00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:33.940\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I've got a bag\nof phones in the back, right?\n\n153\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.096\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I reach over,\n\n154\n00:07:35.096 --> 00:07:36.874\nI steal Dan's device, right?\n\n155\n00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:37.771\n&gt;&gt; Rascal.\n\n156\n00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:38.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n157\n00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.810\nWell, Dan's got protection on his phone,\nright, and Dan calls his carrier and says,\n\n158\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.100\nhey, somebody stole my phone.\n\n159\n00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.940\nAll right, well,\nyou've got the protection on it.\n\n160\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.510\nWe said you got an insurance policy,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n161\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.451\nwe're gonna send you and\nmail you a new device, right.\n\n162\n00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.941\nBut me as the thief,\nI sell it overseas, right?\n\n163\n00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.622\nAnd I sell it overseas and\nsomebody buys it real cheap, they take it,\n\n164\n00:07:59.622 --> 00:08:03.936\nthey try to connect to a carrier's network\nand the carrier let's them join, and\n\n165\n00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:07.639\ngo ahead and\nstart using Dan's phone brand new, right?\n\n166\n00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:12.777\nThey don't because the moment that that\ndevice is stolen, the IMEI is gonna\n\n167\n00:08:12.777 --> 00:08:17.773\nget sent to a database list that's\ngonna be passed between the carriers.\n\n168\n00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:20.570\nAnd it's gonna be marked as\na blocked device from networks.\n\n169\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.255\nThat's one of the things that also\nprotects things like warranty\n\n170\n00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.530\nfrauds, right?\n\n171\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.368\nLet's say that I have the device and\nI say, you know what?\n\n172\n00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:30.781\nI wanna get some money,\nI need to pay the rent, right?\n\n173\n00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:33.858\nSo I'm gonna just say yeah,\nmy phone got stolen.\n\n174\n00:08:33.858 --> 00:08:36.549\nAnd I get a new device and\nnow I've got two devices, right?\n\n175\n00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.690\nWell, what stops me from selling\nthat device to somebody, let's say,\n\n176\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.534\nout there on Craigslist, and\nnow I've made some money, right?\n\n177\n00:08:42.534 --> 00:08:43.700\nNot gonna work that way.\n\n178\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.547\nThen again, that's why these numbers,\n\n179\n00:08:45.547 --> 00:08:47.726\nI would definitely know\na little bit about them.\n\n180\n00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:50.013\nSome of the other things that\nthey call out on the exam,\n\n181\n00:08:50.013 --> 00:08:53.014\nthey call out what's known as a PRI,\nthat's primary rate interface.\n\n182\n00:08:53.014 --> 00:08:54.980\nWe're talking about base\nband communication.\n\n183\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.685\nThey also call out PRLs,\nPRLs are the preferred roaming lists.\n\n184\n00:08:59.685 --> 00:09:02.080\nThe base band updates, the PRL updates,\n\n185\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.850\nthis is typically something that\nyou aren't gonna do yourself.\n\n186\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.610\nThis is something that\nthe manufacturer is gonna do.\n\n187\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.360\nA preferred roaming list says hey, when\nI'm in another carrier's network, right,\n\n188\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.626\nbecause they enter these\npeering relationships or trust.\n\n189\n00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:19.837\nIt's more like a peering relationship\nwhere it says hey, I've gone, let's say,\n\n190\n00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:21.470\nto Australia, right?\n\n191\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.140\nWell, I'm not on the Verizon\nnetwork anymore.\n\n192\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.740\nIn fact, we went to Auckland, New Zealand.\n\n193\n00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.530\nWe went to Australia a couple of times,\n\n194\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.740\na couple of different\nlocations in Australia.\n\n195\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.010\nAnd well, guess what, I'm on a completely\ndifferent carrier's network.\n\n196\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.350\nWell, how is my phone gonna make a choice\nof which network to join, right?\n\n197\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.489\nWell, that's gonna be my carrier updating\nthe preferred roaming list within\n\n198\n00:09:40.489 --> 00:09:43.450\nthe software of the phone itself, right?\n\n199\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.107\nTypically you don't see this really,\nand it's just as you\n\n200\n00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:49.191\nget the over the air firmware updates,\nthe radio firmware updates,\n\n201\n00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:52.303\nthat's gonna be something that's\nupdated automatically for you.\n\n202\n00:09:52.303 --> 00:09:53.870\nYou really don't have to see it.\n\n203\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.530\nBut it is something they mention on the\nexam, so we want you to be aware of it.\n\n204\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.121\nAll right, now, with all of that talk\nabout the wireless communication,\n\n205\n00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:04.427\nthe one that I didn't talk about is\none of the most prevalent wireless\n\n206\n00:10:04.427 --> 00:10:06.028\ncommunications next to Wi-Fi.\n\n207\n00:10:06.028 --> 00:10:08.660\nWell, Wi-Fi, we gotta talk about as well.\n\n208\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.919\nIf you're not familiar\nwith the Wi-Fi standards,\n\n209\n00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:16.222\nwe do address that in the 901 series.\n\n210\n00:10:16.222 --> 00:10:19.840\nIt's gonna be part of the accelerated\nseries, but check out our wireless because\n\n211\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.630\nwe'll talk about things like 802.11,\nright, the IEEE's 802 standard.\n\n212\n00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.199\nWe'll talk about A, B, G, N and AC, all\nthe standards you need to know when you're\n\n213\n00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:29.837\nmaking a choice,\nwhen it comes to wireless communications.\n\n214\n00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:34.598\nThat's also something that you can see\ninside of your Android devices and\n\n215\n00:10:34.598 --> 00:10:37.996\nyour iOS devices,\nyour mobile operating systems.\n\n216\n00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:41.670\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\njust take a look at this real quick.\n\n217\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.970\nSo it doesn't matter which\ndevice you have, right?\n\n218\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.230\nIf I go into the settings here,\nand I go to Connections,\n\n219\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.220\nyou'll see that I have Wi-Fi right here,\nand this would give me the ability,\n\n220\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.170\nthat if I want to,\nI can select the wireless networks, right?\n\n221\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.390\nSame thing goes with the iPad,\nno different, right?\n\n222\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.680\nI have wireless network share, then I\ncan see all the wireless networks, and\n\n223\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.790\nonce I enable or turn on or\noff the wireless adapter, right?\n\n224\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.048\nSo not that big of a deal,\nbut be aware of it and\n\n225\n00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:06.554\nalso be aware of some of\nyour wireless standards.\n\n226\n00:11:06.554 --> 00:11:09.735\nIn case they put you in a situation where\nyou have to support a mobile device, and\n\n227\n00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:12.120\nyou have to know what\nnetwork to connect to.\n\n228\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.260\nIt's really gonna be standard spaced.\n\n229\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.687\nAnd again, the next most prevalent,\nI would say,\n\n230\n00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:18.617\nwireless communication is Bluetooth.\n\n231\n00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:21.000\nIt's also something we have to\ntalk about real briefly here.\n\n232\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.010\nBluetooth, a very easy,\n\n233\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.130\nbreezy way to set up wireless\ncommunications between two devices, right?\n\n234\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.210\nAnd it usually involves, well,\nsomething as simple as turning it on.\n\n235\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.293\nSo, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n236\n00:11:31.293 --> 00:11:34.834\nSo for instance here in our iOS device,\nwe have Bluetooth, right, and\n\n237\n00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:36.800\nI could turn on Bluetooth.\n\n238\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.390\nWhen I turn on Bluetooth, it's gonna look\nfor devices that it can connect to you.\n\n239\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.220\nYou can see that it sees my MacBook Pro.\n\n240\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.350\nAnd if I wanted to, I could actually\ngo through the pairing process and\n\n241\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.230\nI can actually connect my, and\nit's not gonna let it do it.\n\n242\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:55.440\nLet me open my Bluetooth preferences\nhere and see, there it is.\n\n243\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.890\nAll right, now let it see if it'll\npair it up here, and there it is.\n\n244\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.390\nIt's giving me a security number.\n\n245\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.750\nAnd that security number is important\nbecause I need to make sure that I\n\n246\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.900\ndo verify that that is the connection\nthat I wanna make, just so\n\n247\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.780\nwe don't have any kind of\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n\n248\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.330\nBut now these two devices can actually\ncommunicate amongst each other.\n\n249\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.634\nUnderstand that sometimes you\nhave to manually enter a PIN,\n\n250\n00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.042\na personal identification number.\n\n251\n00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:20.392\nAnd if that doesn't happen, then your\ndevices aren't gonna go into the pairing\n\n252\n00:12:20.392 --> 00:12:23.198\nprocess, and\nthey're not gonna be able to communicate.\n\n253\n00:12:23.198 --> 00:12:24.690\nYou also wanna test the settings too, and\n\n254\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.400\none of the ways that you can do\nthat is to simply use the device.\n\n255\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.479\nVery simple to enable Bluetooth,\nit's one of the reasons it's very,\n\n256\n00:12:31.479 --> 00:12:32.773\nvery common on your devices.\n\n257\n00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:35.895\nAnd if we go back to my\nwireless settings here or\n\n258\n00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:39.320\nnetwork connection settings, if you will.\n\n259\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:39.900\nYou can see,\n\n260\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.870\nit's really no different if we talk\nabout inside of your Android device.\n\n261\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.610\nSimple as turning it on and\n\n262\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.850\nthen finding the devices that are out\nthere that are in a discoverable mode.\n\n263\n00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.860\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I know that in the past,\n\n264\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.160\nBluetooth has been\na notorious battery sucker.\n\n265\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.230\nIs that still common?\n\n266\n00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.120\n&gt;&gt; It isn't.\n\n267\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.360\nNow, let's be careful with that,\n\n268\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.170\nbecause it all depends on the version\nof Bluetooth you have, right?\n\n269\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.570\nUp until 3.0,\nyou are absolutely right, Dan.\n\n270\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:08.820\nThis thing would just drain your\nbattery life, just as much as it could.\n\n271\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.917\nWhen the 4.0 standard came up,\nwhich is what this iPad Pro has,\n\n272\n00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:16.004\nBluetooth is a very low\npowered implementation.\n\n273\n00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.269\nSo much so that they say that the battery,\n\n274\n00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:22.415\nthat's a small dime sized battery\nthat's in some of these mobile devices,\n\n275\n00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:25.810\ncould power a Bluetooth\ncommunication up to ten years.\n\n276\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.850\nAnd so much so that the battery will\noutlive the device that it's in.\n\n277\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.060\nSo it's a really, really low, yeah,\nit is, it's a really low powered device.\n\n278\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.776\nBut like any other type of network\nconnection, we say if you're not using it,\n\n279\n00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:38.802\ndisable it, right?\n\n280\n00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:40.690\nIt could be a security vulnerability.\n\n281\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.650\nAny kind of unused connection\nreally should be turned off.\n\n282\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.980\nAll right, so those are some\nof the wireless connections.\n\n283\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.536\nNow what happens if you decide that hey,\nI'm gonna take a trip on an airplane.\n\n284\n00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:55.424\nAnd guess what, you're taxiing the runway,\nand they say, all right,\n\n285\n00:13:55.424 --> 00:13:58.677\nit's time to disable all of\nyour wireless electronics, and\n\n286\n00:13:58.677 --> 00:14:02.223\nput your tables in the upright position,\nincluding your chair.\n\n287\n00:14:02.223 --> 00:14:04.205\nWell, that's something\nknown as airplane mode.\n\n288\n00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:07.281\nIf you're gonna disable all the radios,\nyou can put your devices in airplane mode.\n\n289\n00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:10.485\nAnd again, kinda fairly simple\nto do something like this.\n\n290\n00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:13.777\nIn fact, I'll show you right\nhere on our wireless, or\n\n291\n00:14:13.777 --> 00:14:18.718\nour mobile operating systems, if I happen\nto be in the Android operating system,\n\n292\n00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:21.241\nlet's see, does it do that right there?\n\n293\n00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:25.513\nYeah, airplane mode right here in our\nAndroid operating system, and again,\n\n294\n00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:29.930\ndepending on the vendor specific,\nI don't know, flavor of Androids you have.\n\n295\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.498\nYou might see that it's in a couple\nof different locations, but for\n\n296\n00:14:32.498 --> 00:14:34.132\nthe most part, it's fairly easy to find.\n\n297\n00:14:34.132 --> 00:14:38.720\nAnd if you're an iOS device, well,\nit's right there in your settings.\n\n298\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.020\nYou can see at the top.\n\n299\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.114\nKeep in mind that if you do turn this on,\nthis is where it'll get tricky.\n\n300\n00:14:44.114 --> 00:14:48.480\nIf you turn this on, you turn all of\nyour wireless communications off.\n\n301\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.000\nBut that is a feature that is in\nall of your mobile devices, and\n\n302\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.550\nit is important to make sure that you\nare paying attention if you are travelling\n\n303\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.720\nwithin any kind of aviation environment,\nright?\n\n304\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.060\nAll right, let's look at a couple\nother things that we have on our list.\n\n305\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.261\nWe have, well, other types of\nconnections that we have to worry about,\n\n306\n00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:10.633\nsomething known as hotspots,\ntethering, and VPN.\n\n307\n00:15:10.633 --> 00:15:13.368\nAnd believe it or not,\nwhile two of them are close,\n\n308\n00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:15.414\none of them is completely different.\n\n309\n00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:19.310\nBut they all revolve around\nsome type of connection, right?\n\n310\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.856\nSo imagine I have a device, right?\n\n311\n00:15:20.856 --> 00:15:22.270\nWell, I've got a couple of them here.\n\n312\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:22.986\n[LAUGH] Imagine I have,\n\n313\n00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.258\nyou don't even have to imagine,\nwe'll just actually have them here.\n\n314\n00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.451\n&gt;&gt; 1922.\n[LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:29.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n316\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.156\nI'll pull out my sea shell.\n\n317\n00:15:31.156 --> 00:15:34.984\nSo imagine that you have your device here\nand what you wanna do is you wanna allow\n\n318\n00:15:34.984 --> 00:15:38.772\nanother device to kinda piggy back off\nof your network connections, right?\n\n319\n00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.976\nYou wanna allow them to\nmake a connection or\n\n320\n00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:44.370\nthat device to make a connection\nthrough another device.\n\n321\n00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.950\nWell, that's where mobile hotspots and\n\n322\n00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.720\nsomething known as tethering come in,\nright?\n\n323\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.960\nThe end goal is really similar, but\n\n324\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.628\nhow they accomplish it is\na little bit different, right?\n\n325\n00:15:53.628 --> 00:15:57.472\nA hotspot essentially allows\nyou to take your device and\n\n326\n00:15:57.472 --> 00:16:01.411\nturn it kinda like into\na wireless access point, right?\n\n327\n00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:05.724\nAnd with a hotspot, I can allow up to\nten devices to connect to my device,\n\n328\n00:16:05.724 --> 00:16:11.410\nand my device will allow those devices\nto connect out to a network connection.\n\n329\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.249\nNow, tethering is close to the same thing,\nright?\n\n330\n00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:17.713\nBut the difference is it's not ten\ndevices, it's typically a cable device,\n\n331\n00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:20.013\na single cable device that you plug in and\n\n332\n00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:24.490\nyou essentially allow that device to\nconnect out there to the Internet.\n\n333\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.240\nIn fact, I can show you there is way\nthat if you've got for instance,\n\n334\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.800\nin iOS, if you got your\nCellular Data that is turned on.\n\n335\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.497\nLet me go ahead and kinda turn this off\ncuz I wanna show you that the hotspot\n\n336\n00:16:35.497 --> 00:16:37.350\nitself will kinda grey out.\n\n337\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.403\nI don't know Dan, can you tell that,\nlet me switch off it here real quick,\n\n338\n00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:41.776\nover to Wi-Fi for just a second.\n\n339\n00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:45.826\nCan you tell how that's kinda grayed\nout there, the Personal Hotspot.\n\n340\n00:16:45.826 --> 00:16:47.587\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This is kinda interesting,\n\n341\n00:16:47.587 --> 00:16:48.794\nthis is the future of iOS.\n\n342\n00:16:48.794 --> 00:16:54.710\nIf I turn Cellular Data on, it turns on\nthe ability to do the Personal Hotspot.\n\n343\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.930\nNow the great thing is, even though I\ndon't have Cellular Data on this iPad,\n\n344\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.630\nI still have the ability to turn on\na Personal Hotspot but you have to\n\n345\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.270\nunderstand how we're gonna do it is\nthrough wi-fi or even Bluetooth, okay?\n\n346\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.054\nSo traditionally, you might hear\nmobile hotspots really in the context\n\n347\n00:17:10.054 --> 00:17:12.110\nof a cellular communication, right?\n\n348\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.340\nYou even have boxes that\nare dedicated to it.\n\n349\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.450\nBut I just wanted to show you that.\n\n350\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:21.524\nThat it allows you to connect multiple\ndevices through your network connection.\n\n351\n00:17:21.524 --> 00:17:25.010\nAll right, VPNs, now VPN is\na virtual private network, right?\n\n352\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.143\nIf I'm connected to a public network and\nlet's say Dan is the administrator and\n\n353\n00:17:29.143 --> 00:17:32.364\nhe set up a file server out there\nwithin the internal network.\n\n354\n00:17:32.364 --> 00:17:38.010\nHe wants to give access to his end users\nto have access to some of their documents.\n\n355\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.925\nBut he certainly doesn't want them doing\nit in an unencrypted manner over a public\n\n356\n00:17:41.925 --> 00:17:44.435\nnetwork, that could be\na security vulnerability.\n\n357\n00:17:44.435 --> 00:17:47.100\nSo we set up a VPN,\na Virtual Private Network.\n\n358\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.149\nAnd what that allows them to do, or\n\n359\n00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:53.315\nwould allow him as administrator to do,\nis to set up my mobile device so\n\n360\n00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:58.137\nthat I can make a connection to a public\nnetwork and the virtual private network.\n\n361\n00:17:58.137 --> 00:18:01.728\nThe VPN would create this virtualized\npoint to point connection between my\n\n362\n00:18:01.728 --> 00:18:02.925\ndevice and in this case,\n\n363\n00:18:02.925 --> 00:18:06.516\nlet's say the file server that's inside\nof the corporate network, or for\n\n364\n00:18:06.516 --> 00:18:10.326\nthat matter, whatever resource is\ninside of the corporate network.\n\n365\n00:18:10.326 --> 00:18:14.740\nAnd then the tunnel essentially makes\nit so that people on the outside,\n\n366\n00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.530\nthey can't really eavesdrop at\nthe data that's inside of the tunnel.\n\n367\n00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.070\nNow we go a step farther than that.\n\n368\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:27.780\nYou can basically make a VPN using\na tunneling protocol, a communication,\n\n369\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.890\na set of rules for communication\nwithout extra security methods.\n\n370\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.250\nBut it kinda defeats the purpose.\n\n371\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.663\nSo a lot of times what we do is we\nencouple or we couple if you will,\n\n372\n00:18:36.663 --> 00:18:40.463\nwe integrate into a VPN encryption\ntechnologies that not only allows us\n\n373\n00:18:40.463 --> 00:18:44.928\nto create that virtualized point-to-point\nconnection between two endpoints.\n\n374\n00:18:44.928 --> 00:18:48.283\nBut as that information moves\nthrough the two endpoints,\n\n375\n00:18:48.283 --> 00:18:52.666\nit is scrambled in a way that, or\nencrypted if you will, scrambled in a way,\n\n376\n00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:57.322\nthat if somebody did get access to the\ninformation, let's say the unauthorized\n\n377\n00:18:57.322 --> 00:19:01.450\nparties wouldn't be able to read it so\na very, very good thing to have.\n\n378\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.294\nAll right, we're gonna move into security\nspeaking of which that is as kind of\n\n379\n00:19:06.294 --> 00:19:07.973\na security thing but one last thing.\n\n380\n00:19:07.973 --> 00:19:08.740\n&gt;&gt; Nice segway Wes.\n\n381\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n382\n00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:13.001\nAnd unfortunately, I'm gonna throw a rock\nin the compound of understanding here\n\n383\n00:19:13.001 --> 00:19:16.311\nbecause I did have another feature that\nI wanted to mention as briefly and\n\n384\n00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:19.049\nthat's mobile pay and\nemergency notifications, right?\n\n385\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.460\nMobile pay systems,\nthey've been out there for a bit.\n\n386\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.460\nThey're very, very handy.\n\n387\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.476\n&gt;&gt; You have to pay to get\nemergency notifications.\n\n388\n00:19:25.476 --> 00:19:25.979\n&gt;&gt; No, no, you do not.\n\n389\n00:19:25.979 --> 00:19:26.988\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n390\n00:19:26.988 --> 00:19:30.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mobile pay systems that you have,\n\n391\n00:19:30.263 --> 00:19:34.752\nyou have things like for instance,\nyou have the ability to wallet,\n\n392\n00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:38.253\nApple wallet I think is one of them-\n&gt;&gt; Such as like Apple pay and\n\n393\n00:19:38.253 --> 00:19:40.663\ngoogle [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and\n\n394\n00:19:40.663 --> 00:19:44.720\nthey've got all different\nkinds of technologies here.\n\n395\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.660\nThe Android one, kind of looks\nlike a little wi-fi connection,\n\n396\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.830\na little wi-fi signal.\n\n397\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.220\nIt's usually always colored white.\n\n398\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.420\nI think we've got one in our break room,\nright?\n\n399\n00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.848\n&gt;&gt; We do.\nOur vending machines actually\n\n400\n00:19:53.848 --> 00:19:54.965\ntake these types of payments.\n\n401\n00:19:54.965 --> 00:19:55.569\nLove it.\n\n402\n00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.846\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\nThe fact that you can take your device and\n\n403\n00:19:57.846 --> 00:20:01.326\nover NFC, near field communication,\ntouch it to whatever the device is that\n\n404\n00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:05.100\nthe point of sale system and you can\nactually make a mobile transaction.\n\n405\n00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.040\nReally great thing to have.\n\n406\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.940\nIn fact, I could show you here on our\niPad, iOS has it actually built right into\n\n407\n00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.300\nthe operating system without having\nto go through to a third-party.\n\n408\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.590\nYou can do Android Pay, you can actually\nget inside of the operating system,\n\n409\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.990\nthe Google Play Store, you can actually\ndownload it as a separate app.\n\n410\n00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.440\nBut one of the great things here is,\n\n411\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.940\nyou have Apple Pay, you're right\nthere down the wallet in Apple Pay.\n\n412\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.460\nAnd I could add a credit card or\na debit card and I could do so.\n\n413\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.870\nAnd you know what,\nlooks like my wi-fi has disconnected here.\n\n414\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.780\nLet me go ahead real quick.\n\n415\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.210\nAnd it probably had something\nto do with that hotspot.\n\n416\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.447\nLet me go ahead real quick and see if\nI can just reset our connection here.\n\n417\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:52.422\nAnd we'll do this one more time, we'll go\nahead and try to re launch it here, and\n\n418\n00:20:52.422 --> 00:20:55.740\nlet's see if we can get\nconnected back again real quick.\n\n419\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.430\n&gt;&gt; Plus you had to do show on using\nthe reflector apps, it's very cool.\n\n420\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I love this app, and\nsometimes it gives me a little bit of\n\n421\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.470\na problem and that's because well, again,\nwe talk about unused connections here.\n\n422\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.059\nYou certainly don't want unused\nconnections staying open.\n\n423\n00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:11.410\n&gt;&gt; And why is that a bad thing?\n\n424\n00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, that's right.\n\n425\n00:21:13.588 --> 00:21:17.339\nSo let me just go ahead and\njust take a second, and all right, there,\n\n426\n00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:19.681\nand it looks like we got connection again.\n\n427\n00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:21.737\nI can interact so\nyou guys can see that out there.\n\n428\n00:21:21.737 --> 00:21:26.820\nSo again, like I said with mobile\npay system, it is great to have.\n\n429\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.290\nNow the last thing I wanna talk about when\n\n430\n00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.500\nwe talk about some of the features\nare emergency notifications.\n\n431\n00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.157\nAgain, it's one of those things\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n432\n00:21:34.157 --> 00:21:38.588\nLet me show where that is inside of,\nfor instance, our iOS, or not iOS,\n\n433\n00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:40.199\nbut our Android devices.\n\n434\n00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:43.260\nSo if I go to,\nI keep going to my app locker.\n\n435\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.860\nLet's go to Settings here.\n\n436\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.740\nAll right, and you know it's not\nin Settings, it's in Messaging.\n\n437\n00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.602\nWe'll get there eventually.\n\n438\n00:21:49.602 --> 00:21:51.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we go to Messaging-\n\n439\n00:21:51.104 --> 00:21:52.114\n&gt;&gt; Just taking the scenic route.\n\n440\n00:21:52.114 --> 00:21:53.364\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe're gonna do this, yeah.\n\n441\n00:21:53.364 --> 00:21:59.110\n[LAUGH] And once you're in Messages, if\nyou choose your Settings button there and\n\n442\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.924\ngo down to Settings, and usually\nwhen you scroll down all the way not\n\n443\n00:22:03.924 --> 00:22:07.670\nquite to the bottom on this one,\nI don't think.\n\n444\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.219\nYeah, almost to the bottom there, you\ncan see that there are emergency alerts.\n\n445\n00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.340\nAll right, and we'll let the emergency\nalerts go ahead and load up,\n\n446\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.240\nnotice that we have\nthe ability to enable or\n\n447\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.570\ndisable the type of emergency\nalerts that we have.\n\n448\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:28.000\nSo again, just an example of\nthe emergency notifications, again,\n\n449\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.340\nthings like your Amber alerts,\nif you will.\n\n450\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.941\nNow it really depends on if your cellular\nprovider is going to basically implement\n\n451\n00:22:35.941 --> 00:22:40.906\nthis, it's usually whether they're\nbasically participating in it.\n\n452\n00:22:40.906 --> 00:22:46.760\nMost of them do, but definitely check\nwith your mobile provider on that one.\n\n453\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.180\nNow, last few things that we wanna\ntalk about as a little basic\n\n454\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:55.165\nsecurity when it comes to these devices\nhere, and one of the first things that we\n\n455\n00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:58.100\ntalked about when it comes to\nsecurity are screen locks, right?\n\n456\n00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.080\nAnd it's biometrics authentication can\nbe something that you can also implement\n\n457\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.200\nin this too.\n\n458\n00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.654\nOne of the things they\ncall out is a swipe lock.\n\n459\n00:23:05.654 --> 00:23:09.050\nUnderstand that a swipe lock\nreally isn't security, right?\n\n460\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.494\nThat's essentially just swiping it and\nyou open it up.\n\n461\n00:23:11.494 --> 00:23:12.260\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] right?\n\n462\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not really doing anything.\n\n463\n00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:15.759\nSo in fact,\nI think that's what I've got set.\n\n464\n00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:17.613\nLet me go ahead and show you guys here.\n\n465\n00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:20.920\nSo if I just lock this device,\nthis Android device.\n\n466\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.364\nI can't remember if I got a pin enabled or\nit's just swipe lock.\n\n467\n00:23:23.364 --> 00:23:26.480\nAnd I go ahead and I turn it on,\nactually it looks like I got no lock.\n\n468\n00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.116\nI got nothing.\n\n469\n00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:29.592\nI'll tell you what, we'll go ahead,\n\n470\n00:23:29.592 --> 00:23:31.940\nit's a good time to show you guys\nwhere you could enable this.\n\n471\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.884\nIt's basic security and if I go to,\nactually this is, I always wanna go to\n\n472\n00:23:35.884 --> 00:23:40.420\nmore, cuz that's where you would think\nthat it's under security, but it's not.\n\n473\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.630\nI know where it's at.\n\n474\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.750\nIt's under My Device.\n\n475\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.700\nAnd then Display, and under Display,\n\n476\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.985\nI believe, no, no, I lied to you there.\n\n477\n00:23:52.985 --> 00:23:54.872\nLock screen,\nit couldn't be that easy, right?\n\n478\n00:23:54.872 --> 00:23:55.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There was\na snake in the picture.\n\n479\n00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:57.739\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly, I would\nhave been bit on that one for sure.\n\n480\n00:23:57.739 --> 00:24:00.134\nSo here we [LAUGH] got the lock screen.\n\n481\n00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:05.950\nAnd you can see that it says none right\nhere, I don't have anything turned on.\n\n482\n00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.927\nBut if I go to the lock screen,\n\n483\n00:24:06.927 --> 00:24:09.523\nyou'll see I've got a whole bunch of\ndifferent things that we can do, right?\n\n484\n00:24:09.523 --> 00:24:12.780\nWe can do the face lock,\nwe can do a swipe lock.\n\n485\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.490\nAnd I love how they talk about\nthe security, No security, Swipe.\n\n486\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.080\nFace lock, Low security,\n\n487\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.745\njust because of the fact that you could\npotentially hold a picture to it.\n\n488\n00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:27.910\nMultifactor authentication means\nyou're using more than one of\n\n489\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.580\nthe authentication factors.\n\n490\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.240\nThis isn't quite\nmultifactor authentication,\n\n491\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.560\nbecause this is using\nbiometrics authentication.\n\n492\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.115\nIf you remember from our security\nshows that we were talking about,\n\n493\n00:24:40.344 --> 00:24:42.247\nWhat are the three authentication factors,\nright?\n\n494\n00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:46.393\nSomething you have, or something you know,\nsomething you have, and\n\n495\n00:24:46.393 --> 00:24:48.520\nthen something you are.\n\n496\n00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.507\nWell, that something you know is\na password, and a username and password,\n\n497\n00:24:52.507 --> 00:24:54.390\nif you will, security questions.\n\n498\n00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:59.049\nSomething you have is like a smart card or\n\n499\n00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:03.033\na key fob, an RFID badge, right?\n\n500\n00:25:03.033 --> 00:25:06.530\nAnd then something you are is biometrics,\nso this technically isn't multi.\n\n501\n00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.282\nThis would be,\n\n502\n00:25:07.282 --> 00:25:13.180\nreally cuz you have to combine more\nthan one of those three factors.\n\n503\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.140\nSo this is really single\nfactor authentication, so\n\n504\n00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.230\nI just have to be careful.\n\n505\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.380\nNow if I did something like face lock,\nright?\n\n506\n00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.235\nFace unlock and PIN, that would be\ntrue multifactor authentication,\n\n507\n00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:27.907\ncuz that would be something you know and\nsomething you are, right?\n\n508\n00:25:27.907 --> 00:25:32.050\nBut again, you can see the different ones\nthat we have, we have password as well.\n\n509\n00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.430\nKeep in mind, PIN and a password,\nwhat would be the difference?\n\n510\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.740\nPIN is typically\na four-character implementation,\n\n511\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.690\nwhere a password can be as many\ncharacters pretty much as it supports.\n\n512\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.583\nSometimes it only supports up to 18\ncharacters, depends on the device or\n\n513\n00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:48.145\nthe operating system.\n\n514\n00:25:48.145 --> 00:25:52.096\nNow, that being said,\nwhen it comes to passwords or PINs,\n\n515\n00:25:52.096 --> 00:25:55.809\nwhat can we do to prevent\nsomebody from sitting there and\n\n516\n00:25:55.809 --> 00:25:59.300\njust typing as many\ncombinations as they can right?\n\n517\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.890\nWell, that's where we can invent policies\nthrough things like mobile device\n\n518\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.040\nmanagement platforms.\n\n519\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.730\nWhere you can do,\n\n520\n00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.068\njust like you can on your workstations\nthat we show you in other episodes.\n\n521\n00:26:08.068 --> 00:26:12.844\nWhere I could do a fail login attempt\nrestriction, which means after so\n\n522\n00:26:12.844 --> 00:26:17.717\nmany times, you will be locked out of\nthe device after so many attempts.\n\n523\n00:26:17.717 --> 00:26:18.660\nYou've got to be careful,\n\n524\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.800\nbecause some of them are a little\nbit more invasive than that.\n\n525\n00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.630\nIn fact, let me show you,\nif we go to the iPad,\n\n526\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.620\nthe iPad by default does something\na little bit more restrictive.\n\n527\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.030\nSo for instance, if I go to,\nI believe it's in the Settings.\n\n528\n00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.190\nAnd Touch ID and Pass Code,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n529\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.201\nenter my super secret password here.\n\n530\n00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:39.821\nAnd if we look down at the bottom here,\nnotice it says,\n\n531\n00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:44.520\nerase all data on this iPad after\n10 failed passcode attempts.\n\n532\n00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.110\nYou've got to be very, very careful,\n\n533\n00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.640\nespecially if you put\na passcode lock on that.\n\n534\n00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.410\nAnd you put the wrong passcode in 10\ntimes, it's gonna eradicate your data,\n\n535\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.770\nit's gonna do essentially a remote wipe.\n\n536\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.180\nWell, this is a local wipe, because\nit's the operating system doing it.\n\n537\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.790\nThe other thing that you could do,\nmaybe we wanna put in a policy in place.\n\n538\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.890\nFor instance, if this is a corporately\nowned device, and we say,\n\n539\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.170\nif you lose the device, what we're gonna\ndo, you're gonna call the administrator.\n\n540\n00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.835\nIf Dan's the administrator,\nI say, hey Dan, I was traveling,\n\n541\n00:27:12.835 --> 00:27:14.979\nI was at a rest stop, I left the phone.\n\n542\n00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:17.630\nI left the phone in the rest stop and\nit's gone, somebody stole it.\n\n543\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.180\nWell, Dan can log into\nthe mobile device platform and\n\n544\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.140\nactually perform a remote wipe,\nwhich can completely eradicate\n\n545\n00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.010\nthe corporate data off of that phone,\nbasically erasing the hard drive.\n\n546\n00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.780\nSo you have the ability to do that too.\n\n547\n00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.740\nOther things that you have are locator\napplications, locator applications\n\n548\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.110\ndo exactly that, they use the GPS systems\nwill allow you to find your device.\n\n549\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.730\nIn fact, iPad or\niOS has this actually built in.\n\n550\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.580\nYou can get standalone technologies or\napps,\n\n551\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.810\nif you will, inside of Android and\nWindows mobile OSes too.\n\n552\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.490\nHowever if we take a look at the iOS here,\n\n553\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.010\nthe iPad actually has one that's built in,\nand it's been around for a while.\n\n554\n00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.010\nIt doesn't work just on iPads,\nit works on iPhones and hence the name,\n\n555\n00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:03.813\nFind My iPhone.\n\n556\n00:28:03.813 --> 00:28:05.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if I log into this,\n\n557\n00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:10.100\nbasically launch this app, you can there\njust for a second, it used a compass, and\n\n558\n00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.700\nit's using GPS, and\nit finds where we are located, right?\n\n559\n00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.214\nAnd we can see Opus Coffee, that's\nthe coffee store that's actually inside of\n\n560\n00:28:17.214 --> 00:28:18.847\nthe building right here in ITProTV.\n\n561\n00:28:18.847 --> 00:28:22.794\nAnd it would allow me that,\nif this device was lost,\n\n562\n00:28:22.794 --> 00:28:26.180\nI could use GPS essentially to find it.\n\n563\n00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.040\nOne cool thing about that feature\nis that it will also report that\n\n564\n00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.490\nlocation up to about 24 hours\nbefore the batteries die.\n\n565\n00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.870\nSo if the battery dies, you could\nlogin to something like iTunes, and\n\n566\n00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.270\nyou can say hey, find my iPhone.\n\n567\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:45.110\nIn this case find my iPad, and it'll say,\nokay, well this location we last received\n\n568\n00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.170\na communication from this device,\nso you can find it here.\n\n569\n00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.410\nSo a great thing to have too.\n\n570\n00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.330\nWhat else do we have, Dan, here?\n\n571\n00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.400\nWe've got all kinds of goodies here,\nremote back up applications.\n\n572\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.840\nThere are applications that\nallow you to do that, right?\n\n573\n00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.560\nFor instance, inside a Android\nyou have the ability to download\n\n574\n00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.550\nan application that says,\nnot only can I perform a remote wipe.\n\n575\n00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.840\nBut before we do that,\nwe're gonna back up all the data, and\n\n576\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.740\nthen we'll perform the remote wipe, right?\n\n577\n00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.890\nSo that's a great thing to have.\n\n578\n00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.485\n&gt;&gt; Probably a good idea at that point,\nright?\n\n579\n00:29:15.485 --> 00:29:16.376\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, exactly.\n\n580\n00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:17.150\n&gt;&gt; Don't lose all that.\n\n581\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Provided that you have that\nsoftware beforehand, right?\n\n582\n00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.320\nYou don't wanna wait till you\nneed your backups to say,\n\n583\n00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.750\ndid I install that backup software?\n\n584\n00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.636\n&gt;&gt; I'll do it right now, wait.\n\n585\n00:29:24.636 --> 00:29:27.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, iOS doesn't really have this.\n\n586\n00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.830\nUnderstand that basically you're\nrunning your iCloud's backups.\n\n587\n00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.740\nYou're backing up to iTunes,\nand you could potentially,\n\n588\n00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.840\nif you wanna secure the backups as well,\nyou can also encrypt them.\n\n589\n00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.947\nSpeaking of encryption,\nthat's another thing that you can do, too.\n\n590\n00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:42.510\nYou can do things like, for\ninstance, full device encryption.\n\n591\n00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.313\nYou set device encryption, if you will,\n\n592\n00:29:45.313 --> 00:29:49.167\non your data within an iOS\ndevice when you set a password.\n\n593\n00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:52.120\nIt allows you the ability\nto encrypt the information.\n\n594\n00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.230\nOr in the iOS, I keep saying iOS,\n\n595\n00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:58.200\nsorry, Android operating system,\nif we can take a look at my screen here.\n\n596\n00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.160\nI can go to Settings, and\nMore, and then Security.\n\n597\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.050\nAnd inside of Security you can see that I\nhave the ability to encrypt the device.\n\n598\n00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:12.020\nI can encrypt the internal storage as well\nas the external storage, which is nice.\n\n599\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.600\nWindows Mobile has BitLocker, so BitLocker\nallows you to encrypt the devices there\n\n600\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.590\ninside of the Windows mobile OS, likewise.\n\n601\n00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:23.590\nSo you can do, on Android devices,\nyou're doing a full device encryption.\n\n602\n00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.420\nKeep in mind in the iPad what you're doing\nis they're saying, hey, we're taking\n\n603\n00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.240\nthe locations that are sensitive,\nand that's what we're encrypting.\n\n604\n00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.360\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that\nit's full device encryption.\n\n605\n00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.459\nI wouldn't worry about that for\nthe exam, just as a heads up, know that.\n\n606\n00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.030\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n607\n00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.570\nWe have some things like\nauthenticator applications.\n\n608\n00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:44.823\nAuthenticator applications are actually\nreally, really cool and really,\n\n609\n00:30:44.823 --> 00:30:46.010\nreally handy.\n\n610\n00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:50.134\nIf you do wanna do a multifactor\nauthentication on your devices, well,\n\n611\n00:30:50.134 --> 00:30:50.918\nguess what?\n\n612\n00:30:50.918 --> 00:30:53.730\nIf you have something like\nGoogle Authenticator, right?\n\n613\n00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.341\nLet me show you here, if you've\nsomething like Google Authenticator,\n\n614\n00:30:56.341 --> 00:30:59.760\nthen what I can do here is,\nI can launch that application.\n\n615\n00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.540\nAnd it allows me to use my password and\n\n616\n00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.640\na code that'll be generated\nrandomly on this application.\n\n617\n00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.648\nAnd I can use that to sign\ninto my Google Account for\n\n618\n00:31:10.648 --> 00:31:15.045\na multifactor authentication,\ngreat thing to have.\n\n619\n00:31:15.045 --> 00:31:19.083\nNow, iOS doesn't have that built in,\nbut you can get multi,\n\n620\n00:31:19.083 --> 00:31:22.620\nsame concept,\nyou can get these for the iOS too.\n\n621\n00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.480\nBut what they do have\nthe ability to do is,\n\n622\n00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.810\nthey do allow you\na two-factor authentication.\n\n623\n00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.150\nIf I go up to the Settings all the way at\nthe top, within Settings, if you will,\n\n624\n00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.620\nthere's Password and Security right here.\n\n625\n00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.576\nAnd if choose Password and Security,\nit's gonna ask me for my password here,\n\n626\n00:31:38.576 --> 00:31:39.562\nimagine that.\n\n627\n00:31:39.562 --> 00:31:43.281\nWe go ahead and I will use,\nit's my Apple ID, so\n\n628\n00:31:43.281 --> 00:31:47.400\nmake sure that you guys get to see that,\nright?\n\n629\n00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we could just kinda view away for\n\n630\n00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.530\njust a second here, because well,\nI don't want everybody seeing my password.\n\n631\n00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.850\nJust a few of you out there, right?\n\n632\n00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.610\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlet me see if I can log in there.\n\n633\n00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:03.370\nIt's telling me no, it cannot do that,\ntry one more time here.\n\n634\n00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.430\n&gt;&gt; It was the camera pressure.\n\n635\n00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what it is,\n\n636\n00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.120\nthat's what is is.\n\n637\n00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.020\nI can't type my password\nwhen somebody is watching.\n\n638\n00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.044\n&gt;&gt; Denise is writing it down right now.\n\n639\n00:32:12.044 --> 00:32:13.986\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes, absolutely.\n\n640\n00:32:13.986 --> 00:32:18.440\nThere we go,\nyou cannot have the caps lock on, Wes.\n\n641\n00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.010\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you can.\n\n642\n00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.960\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n&gt;&gt; You just won't be able\n\n643\n00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.640\nto get in your file.\n\n644\n00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.140\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\nif you set your password that way you can.\n\n645\n00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.380\nAll right, there we go, all we had to\ndo is just make sure that you enter\n\n646\n00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.840\nthe password right, that does help.\n\n647\n00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.500\nAnd you can see right here that we do have\nthe Two-Factor Authentication, right?\n\n648\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.330\nYou can use trusted devices,\n\n649\n00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.770\nphone numbers are used to verify\nyour identity when signing in.\n\n650\n00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:42.790\nSo it does give you the ability to\ndo multifactor authentication here.\n\n651\n00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.354\n&gt;&gt; That was Wes's private home number,\nby the way, if you wanna give him a call.\n\n652\n00:32:45.354 --> 00:32:48.632\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n653\n00:32:48.632 --> 00:32:53.474\nAgain, make sure that if you're gonna\nimplement security on your devices, you do\n\n654\n00:32:53.474 --> 00:32:57.800\nwant to make sure that you have things\nlike at least some kind of passcode.\n\n655\n00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.840\nWhether you're using some of\nthe biometrics authentications or not, or\n\n656\n00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.450\nusing multifactor, make sure that\nyou're locking your devices so\n\n657\n00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.790\nnot just anybody has access\nto your information.\n\n658\n00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.670\n&gt;&gt; All right a lot of good stuff\nabout mobile devices here today\n\n659\n00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.840\non our accelerated track.\n\n660\n00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.890\nSo make sure you go over them enough\ntimes that you understand each one of\n\n661\n00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.840\nthe concepts that might be questioning\nyou on that exam that you're gonna take.\n\n662\n00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.270\nHopefully and passing.\n\n663\n00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.020\nThat's our goal for you guys, anyway.\n\n664\n00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.303\nWes, thanks a lot for lending your\ntime and effort onto this episode.\n\n665\n00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:26.510\nIt's been great and we appreciate it.\n\n666\n00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.386\nWe appreciate our audience for watching\nas well, definitely come back for more.\n\n667\n00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:31.150\nWe've got plenty of shows to come.\n\n668\n00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.920\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n669\n00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.460\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n670\n00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.281\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n671\n00:33:36.281 --> 00:33:37.028\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n672\n00:33:37.028 --> 00:33:44.524\n[MUSIC]\n\n673\n00:33:44.524 --> 00:33:47.187\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:07.520\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.671\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:13.103\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:16.460\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.710\nAnd in today's episode, we are back\nwith more in our accelerated A+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.240\nIt's been a lot of fun so far and,\nwho wouldn't want to be a part of that.\n\n10\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.238\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nto be a part of that, our good friend, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:29.960\nWes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.670\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n13\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.250\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.490\nGreat to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.940\nThat's right, ludicrous speed, go.\n\n17\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Go.\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n18\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.945\n&gt;&gt; Gone\n\n19\n00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:35.949\nplaid.\n[LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.556\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we have gone to plaid.\n\n21\n00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.866\nAnd speaking to gone to plaid\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n22\n00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.060\nwell something completely\ndifferent [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.520\nWe're gonna talk about,\nwell sinking information.\n\n24\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.073\nWhen it comes to our mobile devices, keep\nin mind that we've got different types of\n\n25\n00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:50.530\ndata and we kind of look at\nthose different types of data.\n\n26\n00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.440\nBut I want you to also know that we've\ngot different ways that we can sink\n\n27\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.650\nthat information.\n\n28\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.770\nA lot of times what it revolves around\nis some kind of account that is\n\n29\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.660\nprovided to you based on you know some\nkind of software as a services, right.\n\n30\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.510\nWe look at the cloud today and in other\nepisodes we've talked about what cloud,\n\n31\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.070\nyou know basically what cloud is, right.\n\n32\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.060\nCloud concepts and\n\n33\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.170\none of the most prevalent ones is\nwhether you think you use cloud or not.\n\n34\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.475\nYou probably do, and a lot of even home\nusers use this is something that known as\n\n35\n00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.490\nsoftware as a service.\n\n36\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.900\nIt's basically where you have a provider,\nand\n\n37\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.877\nthey give away service that is basically\ncontrolled and serviced, managed,\n\n38\n00:01:23.877 --> 00:01:26.002\nmaintained and updated by them, right.\n\n39\n00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.890\nWhen I say software is a service,\nI'm talking about typically,\n\n40\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.190\nit's like our email, right.\n\n41\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.645\nEmail was one of the most\ncommon software as a service.\n\n42\n00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:39.285\nAnd even before we had these buzzwords\nknown as the cloud, a lot of people had,\n\n43\n00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:41.785\nwell, basically your\nonline email accounts,\n\n44\n00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:43.355\neven if you weren't in\na corporate environment.\n\n45\n00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:46.945\nNow you could also have corporate\nenvironments too that are now putting\n\n46\n00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:48.855\ntheir information, and\nhave for a while, really,\n\n47\n00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:50.295\nputting their information in the cloud.\n\n48\n00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:54.898\nSo when it comes to mobile devices keep in\nmind that mobile devices typically do some\n\n49\n00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:59.171\nkind of synchronization of the different\ntypes of data that are on them up with\n\n50\n00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.374\nthe cloud provider.\n\n51\n00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:04.450\nNow we're gonna talk about some of\nthose types of data as well as some of\n\n52\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.060\nthe synchronization methods\nthat you might see, all right.\n\n53\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.760\nSo let's go ahead and one of the first\nthings that we wanna talk about is well\n\n54\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480\nIf I'm going to sync information,\nhow do I do that?\n\n55\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.360\nWell, one of the first things that you're\ngonna have to do is you typically gonna\n\n56\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.160\nhave to go to some kind of website or\nsome provider I should say.\n\n57\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.430\nYou're gonna have to go to their website.\n\n58\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.740\nYou're gonna have to create\ntypically an account, right?\n\n59\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.430\nWe talked about another bubble episodes.\n\n60\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.280\nWe talked about the mutual\nauthentication I guess you would say.\n\n61\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.792\nIt's really SSO, is what it boils down to.\n\n62\n00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:37.767\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Single Sign-On, right?\n\n63\n00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:42.028\n&gt;&gt; Right, they try to come up with these\nindustry neutral, vendor neutral terms,\n\n64\n00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:46.590\nbut when it some down to it, it is\nSingle Sign-On, just like Dan said, right?\n\n65\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.950\nI create one account, I remember one\npassword, and then I can log into\n\n66\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.870\nthe multiple services with a single\npassword, and that's great, right?\n\n67\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.090\nBecause one of the things that that does,\nright?\n\n68\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.940\nWhen we talk about security, and\nwe've talked about mobile security,\n\n69\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.530\nwe've talked about security in other\nepisodes, workstation security.\n\n70\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.980\nUnderstand that password\nmanagement is really difficult but\n\n71\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.450\nit's one of the most difficult things\nthat the administrator can do.\n\n72\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.170\nHelp desk can do all the time,\nI bet you, we wouldn't have enough\n\n73\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.975\ntime in this episode if I was to ask them\nto tell you some of the war stories he has\n\n74\n00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:20.005\nwhen it comes to dealing with help\ndesk can password research, right?\n\n75\n00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.175\nPassword management is\nan extreme complexity, right?\n\n76\n00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:25.295\nWell we also need passwords.\n\n77\n00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:28.585\nThe other complex thing is, well,\nif you tell people they have to have these\n\n78\n00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:32.355\nstrong passwords,\nthey have to change them every so often,\n\n79\n00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:35.755\nthat people start to write them down,\nand again it just becomes a big mess.\n\n80\n00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:38.430\nBut that's only for one simple thing.\n\n81\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.910\nLogging into your corporate network.\n\n82\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.880\nImagine if you had to have multiple\npasswords to log into the different\n\n83\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.110\nservices within a single network.\n\n84\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.070\nNow it becomes a nightmare.\n\n85\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.020\nSo with single sign on right with this\ncloud based solution that you had,\n\n86\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.940\nyou have one password, it becomes easier\nto manage because of the fact that you\n\n87\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.660\ncould change a password,\ncreate a password, have one count in\n\n88\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.870\none location and then you can synchronize\nthat password Across multiple locations.\n\n89\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.348\nSo that's one of the first\nthings you kinda wanna know,\n\n90\n00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.895\nthat when it comes down to synchronization\nit all resolves, I guess revolves.\n\n91\n00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.208\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I can say that right, now resolve,\n\n92\n00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.850\nrevolves around single sign on.\n\n93\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.230\nSo if I am gonna do something\nlike single sign on and\n\n94\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.750\nI want these types of data that\nwe'll discuss here in a second to be\n\n95\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.590\nbasically synchronized from my mobile\ndevices up to the cloud, where do I start?\n\n96\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.130\nWell actually I have to start at\nthe SSO implementations, right?\n\n97\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.550\nI have to start with things\nlike Apple IDs, right?\n\n98\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.850\nI have to start with something\nlike a Google ID, right?\n\n99\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.140\nA Google ID if you will basically\nyour Google account, you go update.\n\n100\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.620\nIn fact let's go ahead and\nlet's show you, right.\n\n101\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.600\nI don't know if I'm actually logged in,\nwe're about to find out.\n\n102\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.807\nOkay, so\nI'm logged in basically [CROSSTALK].\n\n103\n00:04:44.807 --> 00:04:47.164\n&gt;&gt; Is this basically [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n104\n00:04:47.164 --> 00:04:47.664\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n105\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.107\n&gt;&gt; I bet you that's not what\nit suppose to look like.\n\n106\n00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:58.156\n&gt;&gt; Pretty sure, that's not what\nWes is seeing on his screen.\n\n107\n00:04:58.156 --> 00:04:59.691\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dan, brilliant.\n\n108\n00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:01.182\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you are,\n\n109\n00:05:01.182 --> 00:05:03.934\nI don't know what kind of computer\nyou got, but I ain't getting it.\n\n110\n00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.911\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:15.685\nAll right.\n\n112\n00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:17.140\n&gt;&gt; We could start our PC save.\n\n113\n00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n114\n00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:26.620\nTrying to think how I wanna do that.\n\n115\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.240\nCuz I actually kinda wanna log out I\ndon't wanna be logged in right now.\n\n116\n00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.470\n&gt;&gt; So do that, you know I'm already logged\nin but let's back it up just a little bit.\n\n117\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.936\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nOkay that's a great idea cuz we have\n\n118\n00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.110\nalready shown episodes-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n119\n00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Where I have been using this account.\n\n120\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Good idea.\n\n121\n00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:44.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Dan it does look I'm logged in and\n\n122\n00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:48.060\nI'm basically logged in guys with\nthe account that we've been using already.\n\n123\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.650\nSo let me go ahead and\njust take a second here.\n\n124\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.370\nAnd somewhere in the settings\nyou should be able to sign out.\n\n125\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.250\nLet's see here.\n\n126\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.487\nWhere is the,\nI honestly don't know where it is.\n\n127\n00:05:58.487 --> 00:05:59.920\n&gt;&gt; I think it's in that yeah.\n\n128\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.730\n&gt;&gt; It's right here.\n\n129\n00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.270\nI'm sorry right here.\n\n130\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.328\nSo let me go ahead and just sign out here\nreal quick and then notice it says Hi well\n\n131\n00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:10.038\nyou are and again this is the account\nthat we've been using in the past.\n\n132\n00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:12.438\nWell if you've never done this before and\n\n133\n00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:16.120\nwell you probably wouldn't\nhave one of these accounts.\n\n134\n00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.682\nSo one of the things that you can\nactually do is if I believe we\n\n135\n00:06:18.682 --> 00:06:21.438\nchoose the down arrow here- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But some are gonna go that they've\n\n136\n00:06:21.438 --> 00:06:23.760\nnever done this before I guarantee\nthey don't have one of these.\n\n137\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's a pretty good way, [LAUGH]\nand it's a pretty good way to put it Dan.\n\n138\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.820\nYeah, that's right.\n\n139\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.433\nSo, what we're gonna do is,\nnotice that it tells you, it says,\n\n140\n00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.901\nhey sign in with a different account, or\nin this case I'd probably say under more\n\n141\n00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:40.276\noptions It tells you that you\ncan create an account, right?\n\n142\n00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:44.630\nAnd then in here we can go through\nthe process of creating your account.\n\n143\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.690\nI'm not gonna do this just to understand\nthis is where you would do a Google\n\n144\n00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.200\naccount, right?\n\n145\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.800\nThis is one of the things that\nthey might ask you in the exam.\n\n146\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.620\nWhat type of account?\n\n147\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.750\nWhat you need in order to\nbasically partake in some\n\n148\n00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.910\nkind of SSO implementation, right?\n\n149\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.713\nWell that isn't the only thing to.\n\n150\n00:06:58.713 --> 00:07:04.150\nIf you also have what's known as an Apple\nID that I want you to be aware of too.\n\n151\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.320\nAnd that's also part of\nour SSO implementation and\n\n152\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.620\nmanaging your mobile devices.\n\n153\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.190\nNotice that it has a Manage your Apple ID,\nright.\n\n154\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.335\nSo if I log in, I'm probably still I'm\nnot logged into this one which is good.\n\n155\n00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:21.360\nI could be but noticed again If you've\nnever done this before, chances are and\n\n156\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.250\nI'll get this one right this time,\nprobably never been here and seen this.\n\n157\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.950\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's create your own Apple ID.\n\n158\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.640\nThis process is pretty much the same so\nyou're gonna go through this list and\n\n159\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.159\nanswer the different questions and\nyou're gonna create your account.\n\n160\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.750\nThat's another way that you could do this.\n\n161\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.850\nAnd you could basically start using\nsome kinda SSO implementation to\n\n162\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.150\nsynchronize the different\ntypes of data that you had.\n\n163\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.910\nThe other thing that we have too,\nand we might as well go ahead and\n\n164\n00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.580\ntalk about is what's known\nas a Microsoft account.\n\n165\n00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.337\nAll right.\n\n166\n00:07:56.337 --> 00:07:59.236\nAnd you know what, I'm gonna do this\njust a little bit different here.\n\n167\n00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:03.289\nLet me go down and let me actually\nopen up a new Incognito window,\n\n168\n00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:06.680\nthen I know it's not gonna\ncache any of the settings.\n\n169\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.810\nCuz I'm pretty sure I've logged in with\na Microsoft account before as well,\n\n170\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.350\nand we just kinda wanna show you\nif you've never been here before,\n\n171\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.050\nwhat you would see for the first time.\n\n172\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.990\nSo go into your Microsoft account,\njust type in any search engine,\n\n173\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.330\nMicrosoft account.\n\n174\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.380\nNotice it tells you that you can sign in\nagain with your Microsoft account, right?\n\n175\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.590\nAnd if you've never created one before,\nyou can do this pretty much here.\n\n176\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.550\nAll right, and we can say sign in and,\nwell, if you don't have an account,\n\n177\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.460\nyou're gonna create one, right?\n\n178\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.740\nThis is where you go through\nthe process of creating your account.\n\n179\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.240\nIf you have an existing email address,\n\n180\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.360\nyou know I can just type it\nin here if I already had one.\n\n181\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.050\nI could use, for instance, the one that\nwe've been using throughout our mobile\n\n182\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.790\nsession here, and I could create an\naccount and go through the same process.\n\n183\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:59.910\nSo nothing really crazy on that, you\njust have to have that account created.\n\n184\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.570\nNow, once you have those accounts created,\n\n185\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.560\nwhat is the next thing\nthat you're gonna see?\n\n186\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.610\nWell again, you do have\nthe ability to potentially, and\n\n187\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.830\nlet me go ahead and\nreconnect to our iPad here.\n\n188\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.780\nLooks like it fell asleep on me.\n\n189\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.060\nWe'll go ahead real quick.\n\n190\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.971\n&gt;&gt; It's tired.\n\n191\n00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:18.744\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n192\n00:09:18.744 --> 00:09:20.063\nIt's been a long day on it, right.\n\n193\n00:09:20.063 --> 00:09:22.939\n[CROSSTALK] That's probably\nwhat's the issue is.\n\n194\n00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:23.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if it'll connect,\n\n195\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.420\nthere it goes.\n\n196\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.770\nOkay.\nSo we just refresh that real quick.\n\n197\n00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.100\nNow, if you've never created,\nlet's say here on our iPad, right?\n\n198\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.070\nIf you've never done any\nsynchronizing of data.\n\n199\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.680\nWell, what data types are we\ntalking about, right?\n\n200\n00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.600\nWell, we're talking about you\nhave things like contacts, right?\n\n201\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.640\nContacts are important.\n\n202\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.310\nIn fact, you can see up here in the upper\nright-hand corner, I have contacts here.\n\n203\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.330\nYou also have this within your\nAndroid device here that we also have.\n\n204\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.720\nYou've got things like programs, or\nyou could just say applications, and\n\n205\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.530\nthat's where things like\nthe App Store come in handy.\n\n206\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.680\nRight, if you're in the App store and\nyou've got your,\n\n207\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.275\nyou're logged in with your\nApp ID your Apple ID.\n\n208\n00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:02.470\nIf this is a new device,\nmaybe I've had an Apple or\n\n209\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.250\nan iPad in the past and\nI wanna go ahead and\n\n210\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.820\ndownload the applications that I've\nalready installed before or purchased.\n\n211\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.190\nWell guess what I login with my Apple ID\nand I can synchronize my apps, or\n\n212\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.490\nmy programs if you will, down to\nthe new iPad implementation, right?\n\n213\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.200\nAnd we can do things like email too,\nemail's another one, right,\n\n214\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.830\nthat we could do.\n\n215\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.930\nWe could do things like your pictures,\nmusic,\n\n216\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.580\nif you have things like iTunes, right?\n\n217\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.360\niTunes allows you\nthe ability to synchronize\n\n218\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360\nthe music that you've\npurchased before as well.\n\n219\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.790\nYou can also do things like video too, and\nall, I'm just saying your Apple id right,\n\n220\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.630\nyou can do this with Google, you can do\nthis with your Microsoft account is great,\n\n221\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.500\ninside of your Windows,\nyour Windows mobile operating systems.\n\n222\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.960\nThey allow you to synchronize\nthings like bookmarks.\n\n223\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.960\nI'm going to show you some of\nthese things coming up as well.\n\n224\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.820\nYour calendar, right?\n\n225\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.720\nHow great is that, that if you've got\na lot of calendar information in your\n\n226\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.180\nbusiness related email, and you want to\nmake sure that hey, the moment I buy or\n\n227\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.060\npurchase this mobile device, I log in\nwith that SSO implementation, right?\n\n228\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.870\nAnd it synchronizes all\nof those calendar marks\n\n229\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.650\nall the way down to your mobile device.\n\n230\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.200\nAnd now I don't have to go through\nthe process of recreating them.\n\n231\n00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.440\nThat's great, you know?\n\n232\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.870\nAgain, things like in your browsers,\nthings like bookmarks, right?\n\n233\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.930\nWe can synchronize those as well.\n\n234\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.250\nLocation data is good too.\n\n235\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.520\nNow location data is interesting.\n\n236\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.660\nAnd again, I'm going to show you\nan example of that coming up.\n\n237\n00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.850\nBut you can do things like, for\ninstance, we talked about the iPad.\n\n238\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.200\nRight, we have find my iPhone.\n\n239\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.430\nIt really finds any of your iOS devices.\n\n240\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.890\nBut find my iPhone, you can actually\nsynchronize that data up to iCloud.\n\n241\n00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.010\nAnd that's great because,\nwell, guess what?\n\n242\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.640\nYou might wanna have that information\njust in case you have to do some kinda\n\n243\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.320\nrestorative process as part of\nsystem maintenance, troubleshooting,\n\n244\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.860\nif you will,\nsocial media information as well.\n\n245\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.980\nLikewise, you can do things like e-books,\nright?\n\n246\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.110\nInside of your iPad,\nyou have things like books,\n\n247\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.710\nin general, i-books,\nI believe they call it.\n\n248\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.850\nSo you have a lot of different options.\n\n249\n00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.750\nIn fact, let's go ahead and show you some\nof the options that I'm talking about,\n\n250\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.280\nall right?\n\n251\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.682\nSo, if I'm in my iOS device,\nand in this case, I'm on iPad.\n\n252\n00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:19.560\nUnderstand that the process will be\npretty similar to an iPhone as well.\n\n253\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.820\nSo we just happen to have an iPad here.\n\n254\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.710\nNotice that it tells me at\nthe top here that if I want to,\n\n255\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.270\nlet me kinda make that\nscreen a little bit larger.\n\n256\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.550\nHopefully it will be easier for\nyou to see for you guys.\n\n257\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.460\nNotice it says Sign in to your iPad,\nSet up iCloud, the app store and more.\n\n258\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.240\nSo there's your programs.\n\n259\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.580\nThere is a lot of our other stuff\nthat we're gonna see here coming up.\n\n260\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.000\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n261\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.251\nAnd I'm gonna use the same account that\nwe've been using in the past here.\n\n262\n00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:46.710\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nguys how bad I type.\n\n263\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.810\nAnd we'll try to spell\nit A plus this time.\n\n264\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.550\nI can't remember what the heck I spelled\nit last time but I'm sure it wasn't that.\n\n265\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.050\nA plus and we'll do gmail.com, and\n\n266\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.740\nif we could just steer away just for\na second on the password here.\n\n267\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.930\nCertainly don't want to\nshow Dan my password here,\n\n268\n00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.715\nespecially when he might be\nable to go shopping with it.\n\n269\n00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:11.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I had money.\n\n270\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.245\n&gt;&gt; I'm on eBay right now.\n\n271\n00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:13.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go.\n\n272\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.430\nSo it does look like we're signing in,\nwe can go ahead and switch back to that,\n\n273\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.950\nthank you very much, I do appreciate that,\n\n274\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.355\nand you see here that it does say\nthat it's signing into iCloud.\n\n275\n00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:24.650\nRight, we'll give it a second here and\nwe'll let it sign in and\n\n276\n00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.940\nkeep in mind that it's going to\ndo potential synchronization.\n\n277\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.450\nNow here's the kicker, and\nI also have to do local authentication\n\n278\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.640\nbecause it needs to make sure,\nis this your iPad?\n\n279\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.030\nIf somebody leaves the iPad open,\nand steals it, and guess what?\n\n280\n00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:45.130\nIf you haven't put the lock screen,\nwe talked about securing mobile devices.\n\n281\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.160\nYou haven't put a lock screen with\na password on it, well guess what?\n\n282\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.710\nThey can back it up to iCloud, and when\nthey back it up to iCloud, it now becomes\n\n283\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.400\na registered device in their name,\nso you have to be careful with that.\n\n284\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.320\nSo we'll go ahead and\na great thing about this one is it doesn't\n\n285\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.410\nreally show you what the password is,\nso that's good.\n\n286\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:04.380\nAll right and now it's signing in and\nit's going to synchronize.\n\n287\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.700\nNow one thing I was gonna say\nwas be careful with this one.\n\n288\n00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.390\nIf you haven't synchronized in the past\nyou don't have any data to pull down.\n\n289\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.500\nRight, so make sure that when\nyou set up a mobile device for\n\n290\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.300\nthe first time if you're expecting to be\nable to synchronize information between\n\n291\n00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.690\nmultiple devices, that you set\nthese settings beforehand, right.\n\n292\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.420\nBecause, it's one of those things\nwe joke around, but it's true.\n\n293\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.540\nBut, we joke around, and here let\nme show you, this is great, right?\n\n294\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.930\nSo, I told you it does bookmarks.\n\n295\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.370\nNotice Safari data here.\n\n296\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.240\nIt said, hey,\nyou wanna transfer that Safari data down?\n\n297\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.600\nAnd it will pull my bookmarks that I've\nhad on my other devices out of the cloud.\n\n298\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600\nIt's a great thing to have.\n\n299\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.700\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes,\nthis is an aggregate thing, right?\n\n300\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.690\nIt doesn't say,\nyou've signed in with this device.\n\n301\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.420\nIt's got this bookmarks in Safari and\nthen says, okay, I wanna merge that.\n\n302\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.200\nGo ahead, and does it.\n\n303\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.510\nAnd you signed in with a different device\nthat says, it's got these bookmarks.\n\n304\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.720\nI'm gonna erase when we got here.\n\n305\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.020\nHere's the new bookmarks.\n\n306\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.510\nIt just kinda sees if there's any overlap\nand if not, it takes what was there and\n\n307\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.280\nputs it in, right?\n\n308\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Great way to put it.\n\n309\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.680\nAnd that really explains\nthese two options right here.\n\n310\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.700\nIf you look we have merge and\ndon't merge, right?\n\n311\n00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.570\nMerge is doing exactly what you say.\n\n312\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.200\nHey, I'm looking at Safari, it doesn't\nmatter what device you're on, guess what?\n\n313\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.300\nIf you've got a bookmark in Safari,\nwe see that it isn't here.\n\n314\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.090\nDo you wanna add it?\n\n315\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.300\nIt's not an overriding thing.\n\n316\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.111\nSo, very good.\n\n317\n00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.310\nWe'll go ahead and we'll say merge.\n\n318\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.300\nWe'll let it go ahead and do that and\nnow my bookmark's are synchronizing.\n\n319\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.234\nBut we're not done there, we got some\nadditional things that we can look at and\n\n320\n00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:31.306\nwe don't want to just show you setting\nthings up in, you know with your Apple ID.\n\n321\n00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.620\nWhat would a Google account look like?\n\n322\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.040\nBut we also want, I also want to\nshow you the benefits of this too.\n\n323\n00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.040\nWhat's another reason that\nwe do data synchronization?\n\n324\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.960\nWell we told you that you can\nback your data up to iCloud.\n\n325\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.170\nWell what's one of\nthe great benefits of that?\n\n326\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.417\nWhat happens if you lose that information?\n\n327\n00:15:49.417 --> 00:15:52.345\nWouldn't you like to\nhave access to it again.\n\n328\n00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:56.324\nIt's one of those like, why do we\nback up data just on a workstation?\n\n329\n00:15:56.324 --> 00:16:00.899\nWhy do we say, best practice, back up your\nimportant information because you wanna be\n\n330\n00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:03.603\nable to pull it down from\nthe cloud when you need to.\n\n331\n00:16:03.603 --> 00:16:07.893\nAll right, so we have our iCloud it\nis set up and you can see here and\n\n332\n00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:13.281\nlook at some of the different options that\nwe have, and let me back out to you guys.\n\n333\n00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:14.790\nCan see that, right?\n\n334\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.911\nWe got Photos,\nyou can see Emails, Contacts,\n\n335\n00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.308\nCalendar, all the things\nthat we've talked about.\n\n336\n00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:22.532\nNotes, we're just consider that our\ndocuments because a note is a form of\n\n337\n00:16:22.532 --> 00:16:23.057\ndocument.\n\n338\n00:16:23.057 --> 00:16:26.558\nKeep in mind if you have something like\nOffice 365, it will integrate with your\n\n339\n00:16:26.558 --> 00:16:29.672\nMicrosoft account and synchronized\nthat across multiple devices too.\n\n340\n00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:32.238\nRight, we have Safari for our Bookmarks.\n\n341\n00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:34.500\nNews, you can see all kinds of things.\n\n342\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.530\nRemember the location information\nI was telling you Find My iPad,\n\n343\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.060\nit's interesting that on the desktop,\nI've always thought this fun.\n\n344\n00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.817\nLet me show you guys this.\n\n345\n00:16:40.817 --> 00:16:42.850\n&gt;&gt; Might wanna zoom out a little.\n\n346\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Zoom out, yeah, show it to you.\n\n347\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.850\nCan you see it from space?\n\n348\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.255\nNotice what it says, Find my iPhone.\n\n349\n00:16:49.255 --> 00:16:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n350\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.190\n&gt;&gt; But when you look at the settings,\n[LAUGH] it says, yeah,\n\n351\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.730\nFind My iPad, right?\n\n352\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.820\nBut again, if I don't have this turned on\nbeforehand, it doesn't benefit me, right?\n\n353\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.912\nSo make sure you turn this stuff on,\nbefore you decide that you wanna\n\n354\n00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:05.634\nsynchronize this information\nto another device, right?\n\n355\n00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:07.923\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you device having\na better than identity crisis.\n\n356\n00:17:07.923 --> 00:17:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really think it is, right?\n\n357\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.621\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n358\n00:17:10.621 --> 00:17:12.450\nthat's some of the things that you can do,\nright?\n\n359\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.820\nSo let me show you a couple\nof other things too.\n\n360\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.510\nLet's go ahead and, what about is\nthis the only provider, right?\n\n361\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.120\nWell, I can go into, for instance,\nI could go into Mail, right?\n\n362\n00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.710\nAnd if do that,\nlet me go ahead and do that mail.\n\n363\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.710\nAnd I go into Accounts here, all right?\n\n364\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:30.950\nNotice it says, iCloud.\n\n365\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.427\nSo now here is where I get things\nlike my email, my contacts,\n\n366\n00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.824\nit did says basically all\nthe stuff that we just looked at.\n\n367\n00:17:35.824 --> 00:17:38.472\nNo reason to revisit that.\n\n368\n00:17:38.472 --> 00:17:41.420\nBut I can add an account here too, right.\n\n369\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.460\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could come in here and say, well,\n\n370\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.670\nwhat type of account do you want?\n\n371\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.210\nWell, look at all the different accounts,\nwe just mentioned a couple of them but\n\n372\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.820\nyou could see there's quite a few of\nthem including things like Yahoo and\n\n373\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.620\nOutlook, right.\n\n374\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.190\nGoogle, Google is one that we can do,\nright?\n\n375\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.374\nSo if wanna come into here,\nI could do the same thing.\n\n376\n00:17:56.374 --> 00:17:59.774\nFor instance,\nI could take my Google account,\n\n377\n00:17:59.774 --> 00:18:05.340\nprovided that I remember what my username\nand password is and then I can type.\n\n378\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.870\nThose are all challenging things for me.\n\n379\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:12.087\nWe'll go ahead, and if we could just\ntake a second here to look away,\n\n380\n00:18:12.087 --> 00:18:15.447\nI don't want you to see my\nsuper secret password here.\n\n381\n00:18:15.447 --> 00:18:21.455\nAgain, I'm kidding, I trust Dan, but\nwe wanna make sure that this logs in.\n\n382\n00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:22.115\nHopefully, it does.\n\n383\n00:18:22.115 --> 00:18:23.775\nAnd now you can see it is logging in.\n\n384\n00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:30.035\nNow it hasn't fully completed\nthe process yet until I say Save, right?\n\n385\n00:18:30.035 --> 00:18:32.085\nNow, here's one thing that\nI want you to keep in mind.\n\n386\n00:18:32.085 --> 00:18:34.650\nI said it synchronizes documents.\n\n387\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.102\nNotice, what do you notice about\nthat slider right there, Dan?\n\n388\n00:18:37.102 --> 00:18:38.578\nYou can't see it, my head is in the way.\n\n389\n00:18:38.578 --> 00:18:40.969\nThe one that you can't see,\nhere, let's try that.\n\n390\n00:18:40.969 --> 00:18:43.304\nWhat do you notice about\nthat slider next to Notes?\n\n391\n00:18:43.304 --> 00:18:44.163\n&gt;&gt; It is turned off.\n\n392\n00:18:44.163 --> 00:18:45.370\n&gt;&gt; It's turned off, right?\n\n393\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.260\nSo do you think this would do\nme any benefit if I really\n\n394\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.680\nneeded that information?\n\n395\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.291\n&gt;&gt; Probably not in this state.\n\n396\n00:18:50.291 --> 00:18:51.397\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so\n\n397\n00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:55.248\nthis is one of the things that I say,\nbe careful, because by default,\n\n398\n00:18:55.248 --> 00:18:59.980\nthat wasn't on and you'll think I'm\ncovering my tracks, and you're not, right?\n\n399\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.652\nSo let's go ahead and we'll turn that on,\n\n400\n00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:06.310\nall right, just a little slider,\nif I can slide that on there.\n\n401\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.210\nAnd, next thing what we'll do\nis choose Save right here, okay?\n\n402\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.290\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Save.\n\n403\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.160\nAnd it's gonna say adding the account and\nhopefully, it does it.\n\n404\n00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.480\nSometimes it takes a bit.\n\n405\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.011\nI bet, that actually did went\npretty quick, that's good.\n\n406\n00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.141\n&gt;&gt; I did this earlier, cuz you gotta\npractice it a couple of times to make sure\n\n408\n00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:26.290\nthat you know what I wanna show you guys,\nwell, will work right, right?\n\n409\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.039\nWe wanna make sure that you guys\nknow the appropriate stuffs to take.\n\n410\n00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:31.258\nI could tell you the first\ntime I did this,\n\n411\n00:19:31.258 --> 00:19:35.588\nit took probably about three minutes,\nI know that says, wow that's horrible.\n\n412\n00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:39.597\nBut three minutes a time you might say,\nwell, did I do something wrong,\n\n413\n00:19:39.597 --> 00:19:41.058\ndid I do something wrong?\n\n414\n00:19:41.058 --> 00:19:42.730\nOkay is it not working, well.\n\n415\n00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Three minutes,\nwho's got that kind of time?\n\n416\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.890\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I don't have time,\nit should have been done yesterday, right.\n\n417\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:47.877\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:19:47.877 --> 00:19:49.755\n&gt;&gt; So, it could take a little bit, but\n\n419\n00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.110\ndepending on your connection speed.\n\n420\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.880\nI mean if you're on, I don't expect\npeople to be watching this and\n\n421\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.100\nbe on 56k,\nbecause the videos wouldn't look too good.\n\n422\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.360\nBut if you're on limited bandwidth,\nit could take a bit.\n\n423\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.110\nSo just know that.\n\n424\n00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.424\nSo let's go ahead and let's show you a\nlittle bit about what we're talking about.\n\n425\n00:20:05.424 --> 00:20:11.420\nNow, earlier, notice we had no\ninformation on this machine.\n\n426\n00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.710\nIt was brand new, just setup but\nI've got notes already, right?\n\n427\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.160\nHow did these notes get here, right?\n\n428\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.240\nWell, you'll gonna see here.\n\n429\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.670\nIf I click on for\ninstance, my iCloud Note.\n\n430\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.190\nNotice when this was created.\n\n431\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.728\nDan, can you see that?\n\n432\n00:20:24.728 --> 00:20:27.433\nBoth of these were created\nrelatively earlier today.\n\n433\n00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:28.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n434\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Notice I got 10:28,\nwe've got 11 AM, right.\n\n435\n00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.428\nAnd notice, I said,\nthis is my iCloud data.\n\n436\n00:20:35.428 --> 00:20:39.040\nThis data sync created\nearlier in the day and\n\n437\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.530\nI hope this one works on\nthe show when I need it to.\n\n438\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.147\nRight, well same thing here,\n\n439\n00:20:43.147 --> 00:20:45.020\nmy chicken scratch here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.300\n&gt;&gt; For hello, right?\n\n441\n00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.470\nSo again,\nyou can see that the information's there.\n\n442\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.580\nBut also notice Gmail Notes, right?\n\n443\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.125\nSame thing, I just put a couple of\ndocuments in there earlier today, just so\n\n444\n00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:56.485\nyou could see that they were synchronized.\n\n445\n00:20:56.485 --> 00:20:59.585\n&gt;&gt; Are you riding a horse\nwhen you wrote that message?\n\n446\n00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Coffee, coffee, lots of coffee, man.\n\n447\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:02.720\nLots of coffee.\n\n448\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.457\n[LAUGH] So you could see that\nwe synchronize the information,\n\n449\n00:21:06.457 --> 00:21:10.497\nnow let me prove to you,\nthat it is going to synchronize, right.\n\n450\n00:21:10.497 --> 00:21:14.920\nSo let's go ahead and we’ll go back,\nlet me kind of zoom out here.\n\n451\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.376\nWe'll create a new document\nhere inside of Gmail and\n\n452\n00:21:20.376 --> 00:21:23.602\nwe'll say new+doc, right?\n\n453\n00:21:23.602 --> 00:21:25.785\nAnd we'll go ahead and we'll save that.\n\n454\n00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.478\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll go over here to iCloud.\n\n455\n00:21:28.478 --> 00:21:32.726\nWe'll choose a new document and\n\n456\n00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:38.394\nwe will say, new iCloud hood doc, right.\n\n457\n00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:42.850\nNotice that the number's been incremented\nto three in both, they're both there.\n\n458\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.436\nNow watch what happens, okay?\n\n459\n00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:48.315\nWell first of all, you wanna make\nsure that in your settings here,\n\n460\n00:21:48.315 --> 00:21:51.781\nif you're going to make sure\nthat they're synchronized,\n\n461\n00:21:51.781 --> 00:21:53.880\nnotice that we have fetch, right.\n\n462\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.750\nFetch is push,\ncould be push or pull, right.\n\n463\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.390\nIf it's pull,\n\n464\n00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.190\nit means you're bringing information down,\npush means that's part of syncing.\n\n465\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.210\nI don't know the direction.\n\n466\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.916\nPush, I'm sending it to the cloud.\n\n467\n00:22:03.916 --> 00:22:05.576\nPull, I'm pulling it down, right?\n\n468\n00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:09.246\nIt's one of the things that we talk about\nwhen we hear the jargon behind like\n\n469\n00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:13.350\nthe difference between SMTP\nemail versus POP3 email, right.\n\n470\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.850\nWell, you might hear the jargon say,\nSMTP email is a push email,\n\n471\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.664\nthat means it's forwarding,\nits going outbound.\n\n472\n00:22:19.664 --> 00:22:23.129\nVersus POP3 being a pull email,\nwhat is that mean?\n\n473\n00:22:23.129 --> 00:22:25.300\nYou're retrieving it, right.\n\n474\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.572\nSo again, just the direction there.\n\n475\n00:22:26.572 --> 00:22:32.533\nSo we make sure that we have this\nin the appropriate settings.\n\n476\n00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:36.593\nOr, maybe you don't want it,\nmaybe you're really limited bandwidth and\n\n477\n00:22:36.593 --> 00:22:38.230\nyou wanna do manual here.\n\n478\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.270\nI don't like manual cuz I would forget my\nhead if it wasn't attached at the neck,\n\n479\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.440\nso I like the whole set it and\nforget it type thing.\n\n480\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.990\nAll right, so let me go ahead,\nwe'll get back to notes, and\n\n481\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.500\nI just wanna make sure that\nwe have them synchronized.\n\n482\n00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.990\nLooks like everything was\nsynchronized okay, at least if not,\n\n483\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.880\nwe're gonna find out.\n\n484\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.120\nNow what I'm gonna go ahead and do,\nis let me show you one of the benefits.\n\n485\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:05.302\nOkay, let's say, and what I'm\ngonna do is sign out of this iPad.\n\n486\n00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.520\nAnd it's gonna erase all of the data.\n\n487\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.830\nSo that's actually kinda\nwhat we want here.\n\n488\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.804\nAnd if we could just veer just away,\njust for a second here so\n\n489\n00:23:13.804 --> 00:23:17.235\nI could put in another\nsuper secret password here.\n\n490\n00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:23.361\nWe'll do this one time, we'll turn this\noff and we will sign out completely.\n\n491\n00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:24.883\nWe're gonna verify.\n\n492\n00:23:24.883 --> 00:23:26.620\nAll right, so\nit looks like we're signing out.\n\n493\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.259\nAnd it says, hey, we're removing\nyour iCloud data, it's gone.\n\n494\n00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:31.655\nWell, we're gonna double check.\n\n495\n00:23:31.655 --> 00:23:34.600\nWe're gonna verify with that just\nas soon as this finishes here.\n\n496\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.750\nAnd we'll do this one at a time.\n\n497\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.820\nAgain, this could simulate the fact\nthat you're getting a new device.\n\n498\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.539\nCould be the fact that you\nare helping repurpose the device,\n\n499\n00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:46.629\nmaybe your company has\npurchased the device.\n\n500\n00:23:46.629 --> 00:23:51.005\nMaybe you're a tech and\nyour tech company has an extra iPad and\n\n501\n00:23:51.005 --> 00:23:52.950\nthey just sold it, right.\n\n502\n00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.127\nWell how would you get this configured?\n\n503\n00:23:54.127 --> 00:23:56.690\nSo, we removed the iCloud, right?\n\n504\n00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.574\nSo if I go back over here to Notes,\n\n505\n00:23:59.574 --> 00:24:04.636\nyou might notice that notes\nON MY iPAD is Nothing, right?\n\n506\n00:24:04.636 --> 00:24:06.293\nI only have my Gmail account, right?\n\n507\n00:24:06.293 --> 00:24:08.254\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet's do the same thing.\n\n508\n00:24:08.254 --> 00:24:13.149\nLet's go over to our back\nto our mail settings here,\n\n509\n00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:17.946\ne-mail settings, and\nmail down here in our list.\n\n510\n00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:21.497\nAnd what we'll do is we'll go to accounts,\nand we're gonna do the same thing,\n\n511\n00:24:21.497 --> 00:24:22.030\nall right?\n\n512\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.780\nNotice we have Gmail right here,\nand I'm gonna choose Gmail.\n\n513\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.130\nAnd I'm gonna choose, right here,\nDelete Account, all right.\n\n514\n00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.860\nNow it's gonna ask me,\ndo you wanna do that?\n\n515\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.580\nWell remember, one of the things\nthat we did is we turned on Notes.\n\n516\n00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.700\nI wanted to synchronize those documents,\nand that's important, right?\n\n517\n00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.740\nSo let's go ahead, and we're gonna\ndo the same process over again.\n\n518\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.400\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna check out.\n\n519\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.550\nDo I have any notes?\n\n520\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.210\nAnd you might have seen there in\nthe background, everything disappear.\n\n521\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:51.960\n&gt;&gt; It's all gone.\n\n522\n00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.680\n&gt;&gt; I don't have any documents anymore.\n\n523\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.130\nAnd here's where the benefit of\nsynchronization to the Cloud.\n\n524\n00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.520\nNow you could also synchronize\nto your desktop, as well.\n\n525\n00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.130\nThat's something that we have to mention,\n\n526\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.640\nit's part of the list right here,\nDesktop versus Cloud.\n\n527\n00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.600\nDesktop, it could be a Bluetooth\nconnection, could be over a wireless\n\n528\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.670\nnetwork, or it could be quite literally\ntethered directly to your computer.\n\n529\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.468\nThat all depends on what\ntechnology you're using.\n\n530\n00:25:14.468 --> 00:25:17.350\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet's get back into the iPad here.\n\n531\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.170\nAnd, we will set up, again, one more time.\n\n532\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.151\nAnd when I type that right the first time,\nI'm really testing my point here.\n\n533\n00:25:24.151 --> 00:25:25.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead [LAUGH],\n\n534\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.078\n&gt;&gt; And buy a lottery ticket today.\n\n535\n00:25:27.078 --> 00:25:29.285\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, hey, that's a good idea.\n\n536\n00:25:29.285 --> 00:25:32.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're gonna go ahead.\n\n537\n00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.811\nHoney, honey, I swear,\nDan told me to do it.\n\n538\n00:25:34.811 --> 00:25:36.771\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what he's talking about.\n\n539\n00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:38.253\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The camera lies.\n\n540\n00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:40.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that was superimposed.\n\n541\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.020\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and we'll go ahead, and\n\n542\n00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.720\nwe'll put in our super\nsecret password here.\n\n543\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:52.180\nSo let me go ahead, and\nI'll log into our Apple ID here.\n\n544\n00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.860\nAnd hopefully, everything works again,\nwe'll keep our fingers crossed, hopefully,\n\n545\n00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.100\nit does work, I don't know.\n\n546\n00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.230\nOkay, it looks like it's signing in,\nso we're good again,\n\n547\n00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.752\nwe can now pick back up\nwhere we left off there.\n\n548\n00:26:01.752 --> 00:26:05.300\nAll right, and we're setting back\ninto the iCloud, all right, and\n\n549\n00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.080\nwe're gonna let this do,\nit should ask me again, right?\n\n550\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.710\nWell, do I wanna take the Safari\nbookmarks that I have?\n\n551\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.550\nDo I wanna merge that information?\n\n552\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.680\nBecause we see that, hey,\nyou're using Safari maybe on your Macbook.\n\n553\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.000\nYou're using Safari on your iOS device,\nI'm sorry, your iPhone.\n\n554\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.848\nDo you want that information there?\n\n555\n00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:25.610\nAll right, we'll go ahead,\nwe'll just log into the local machine.\n\n556\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.617\nWe'll let it go ahead and\nfinish logging in.\n\n557\n00:26:28.617 --> 00:26:31.378\nOnce it does, we'll go ahead and\njust go right over to Gmail.\n\n558\n00:26:31.378 --> 00:26:34.183\nWe'll log back to Gmail our\nGoogle account, right, and\n\n559\n00:26:34.183 --> 00:26:37.510\nwe'll see that information and\nsee if it synchronizes.\n\n560\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.166\nAnd then, we have access\nhopefully to those documents.\n\n561\n00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:46.195\nAgain, if not,\nwe have definitely done something wrong.\n\n562\n00:26:46.195 --> 00:26:47.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We typed something wrong.\n\n563\n00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.660\nAgain, kind of shooting\nfrom the hip on this one,\n\n564\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.040\nhopefully, we'll see here in\na second that everything goes well.\n\n565\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.800\nSo, and it's asking me to\ndo the whole merge again.\n\n566\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.230\nAnd, while it finishes this up, let me go\nahead and take care of one last thing.\n\n567\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.530\nThey talk about connection times,\nand how you can do this.\n\n568\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.383\nYou can do this over\ncellular communication.\n\n569\n00:27:04.383 --> 00:27:08.671\nKeep in mind, depending on how much\ndata you have, it could be delayed.\n\n570\n00:27:08.671 --> 00:27:11.706\nAll that information going over\ncellular communication, as well,\n\n571\n00:27:11.706 --> 00:27:12.716\nas costing you money.\n\n572\n00:27:12.716 --> 00:27:16.490\nAll right, a lot of times you\nhave unlimited plans today,\n\n573\n00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.620\nbut that's never a guarantee, right?\n\n574\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.071\nIt's not a one size fits all.\n\n575\n00:27:21.071 --> 00:27:24.603\nI have an unlimited plan, and I'm pretty\nsure Dan over here has an unlimited plan.\n\n576\n00:27:24.603 --> 00:27:27.096\nBut you might have,\nmaybe you got a phone for\n\n577\n00:27:27.096 --> 00:27:29.670\na kid that has a limited data amount,\nright?\n\n578\n00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.880\nThat could be a lot of information, right?\n\n579\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.240\nEspecially, when you talk about videos and\nstuff like that,\n\n580\n00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.210\nthey can get really beefy.\n\n581\n00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.570\nAll right, so,\nlooks like the Apple ID logged in.\n\n582\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.100\nWe're gonna go ahead, we won't waste any\ntime here, and we will get right in and\n\n583\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.390\nback in to Mail.\n\n584\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.630\nWe're gonna go to Accounts,\nand I'll go ahead, and\n\n585\n00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.650\nit does look like our iCloud is there.\n\n586\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.920\nWe're gonna try this one more\ntime with our Gmail account,\n\n587\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.220\nwe'll do the same thing here.\n\n588\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.670\nAnd I will type, let me go ahead and\n\n589\n00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.780\ntype the email for\nthis account here real quick.\n\n590\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.115\nAnd we'll get that all logged in here,\nand now here's a time for\n\n591\n00:28:06.115 --> 00:28:08.825\nthe super secret password here, as well.\n\n592\n00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:12.888\nSo let me go ahead, and\nI will type that in.\n\n593\n00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:19.961\nAnd, we'll try that typed in there,\n\n594\n00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:25.028\nAnd then we will see if it logs in.\n\n595\n00:28:25.028 --> 00:28:28.768\nHopefully, it logs in for us, and\nit does look like it's signed in.\n\n596\n00:28:28.768 --> 00:28:30.603\nNotice that it did that fairly quickly.\n\n597\n00:28:30.603 --> 00:28:33.710\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna turn notes back on.\n\n598\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.760\nWe gotta make sure we\nhave the right settings,\n\n599\n00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.570\nwhen we're talking about\nsynchronizing this information.\n\n600\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.100\nAnd now we're gonna test it, right?\n\n601\n00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.037\nLet's, drum roll please, we're gonna\ngo over to Notes here, right, and\n\n602\n00:28:44.037 --> 00:28:47.010\nwe're gonna see if that\ninformation shows up.\n\n603\n00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.960\nNow, it's not there right away, right,\nso we're gonna give it a second.\n\n604\n00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.471\nAnd boom, now I got iClouds,\nI can see that I've got my Notes.\n\n605\n00:28:53.471 --> 00:28:57.261\nI got the brand new note there, all right,\nnow the one thing I don't see, and\n\n606\n00:28:57.261 --> 00:29:00.190\nwhich it's interesting, and\nwe'll find out why that is.\n\n607\n00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:04.360\nIt could take a second, again remember,\none of the things I told you with Gmail?\n\n608\n00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.900\nIs Gmail takes a little bit to get\nsynchronized, so let's go ahead and\n\n609\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.456\nwhile we're waiting for it,\nlet's verify that those settings did.\n\n610\n00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.902\nAnd you know I know what\nexactly what it is Dan.\n\n611\n00:29:13.902 --> 00:29:18.740\nRemember, what I told you nothing\nhappens until you choose Save?\n\n612\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.300\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; It's helpful, right paddle.\n\n613\n00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.300\n&gt;&gt; Wrong gear.\n\n614\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:21.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n615\n00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.610\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about\nthe slimness of Google.\n\n616\n00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.530\nLast time my wife was trying to\nupload something in the Google Drive,\n\n617\n00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.310\nshe was looking at her phone\nto save it's own phone.\n\n618\n00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.920\nShe like, it's not there, and\nI'm like, yes just give it a second.\n\n619\n00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.440\nIt will show up.\n\n620\n00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.110\nYes I hear Mike, does this show up in\nyour Google drive on your computer?\n\n621\n00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.610\nYeah, it does.\n\n622\n00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.640\nI say, all right, just wait.\n\n623\n00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.530\nAnd can you please come and\nlook at this soon as I got up.\n\n624\n00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.100\nThere it is.\n\n625\n00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course\n\n626\n00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.380\n&gt;&gt; So, do you need to have\n\n627\n00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.030\na little bit of patience with\nsome of these cloud services.\n\n628\n00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that really comes in handy\nwhen you talking about helping and\n\n629\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.920\nusual do, cuz essentially,\nthat's like what you're doing.\n\n630\n00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.440\nI mean your wife, It's a little bit\ndaring, cuz it's not a business sense.\n\n631\n00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you know it's.\n\n632\n00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.260\n&gt;&gt; It's at tech support.\n\n633\n00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.418\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's tech support.\n\n634\n00:29:57.418 --> 00:30:02.950\nSo you can now see that over here,\nwe've got both iCloud and Gmail.\n\n635\n00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:08.300\nAnd notice, that I have my iCloud,\nnew iCloud document that I just created.\n\n636\n00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.151\nAnd also,\nI have my new A+ document there in Gmail.\n\n637\n00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:14.180\nNow, let's see, now remember,\nI told you synchronization, right?\n\n638\n00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.150\nWe also talked email and stuff, and\nalerts as well so, one of those things.\n\n639\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.440\nWe go over to my cellphone here.\n\n640\n00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.510\nAnd, I want you to see something here.\n\n641\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:29.090\nNotice that Find My iPhone, right?\n\n642\n00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:33.000\nIt's been disabled on the iPad,\nbut why is it telling me that?\n\n643\n00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.705\nWhy is it telling me that information?\n\n644\n00:30:36.705 --> 00:30:37.438\n[CROSSTALK] Right?\n\n645\n00:30:37.438 --> 00:30:42.162\nWell it's because, I've got Gmail\nset up on my android device, right?\n\n646\n00:30:42.162 --> 00:30:46.410\nSo because of that, I'm getting\na synchronization across these platforms.\n\n647\n00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:52.070\nAnd I'm aware now, even though this is\nan iPad technology in my iOS device,\n\n648\n00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.320\nI'm also seeing it across\nmy Android device.\n\n649\n00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.210\nSo that's a good thing to have,\n\n650\n00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.130\nand I would say that I could\nprobably go even farther than that.\n\n651\n00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.910\nIf I can find my Gmail here real quick,\nI bet you, I could log in.\n\n652\n00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.180\nLet's see, again, if I could find Gmail.\n\n653\n00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.840\nI think I put it in the basic account.\n\n654\n00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.930\nI don't know if I, there it is, Gmail.\n\n655\n00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.820\nAnd I could say, wait a second here, got\na new device, what is this about, right?\n\n656\n00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.520\nSo it's letting me know, hey, did you sign\nin from an Apple iPad, from Apple iPad?\n\n657\n00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.470\nDid you get a new device?\n\n658\n00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.125\nWell I need to be a ware of that, right?\n\n659\n00:31:29.125 --> 00:31:31.700\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] received those emails.\n\n660\n00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.070\nSomeone's trying to log into your\ncomputer from St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\n661\n00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.150\nIs this you?\n\n662\n00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.400\nWell, no, as a matter of fact, it's not.\n\n663\n00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.920\n[LAUGH] So, go ahead and\nchange that password.\n\n664\n00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n665\n00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.292\nAnd you wouldn't know that if you didn't\nhave these synchronization type of\n\n666\n00:31:43.292 --> 00:31:43.875\ntechnologies.\n\n667\n00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:46.339\nSo, that's one of the last things,\nand we kinda wanted to show you,\n\n668\n00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:47.540\nkinda put it into action for you.\n\n669\n00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.330\nShow you the benefit, let alone the\nsecurity benefits of something like that.\n\n670\n00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.610\nBut you can see across multiple platforms,\nright?\n\n671\n00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:59.190\nI can log into my Mac here on Chrome or\nSafari, as well, on a full blown desktop.\n\n672\n00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:03.941\nAnd I could also see that information\nsynchronized across just multiple devices.\n\n673\n00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:07.710\nit's great to have, but it is something\nyou'll have to know how to set up.\n\n674\n00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.899\nAnd it's also something you'll have\nto know to pass that 902 exit.\n\n675\n00:32:10.899 --> 00:32:13.628\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well,\nthanks for dropping by, and\n\n676\n00:32:13.628 --> 00:32:16.210\nlending your expertise to us,\nwe appreciate it.\n\n677\n00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.840\nWatch us out there for joining us and\npartaking of the great\n\n678\n00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.710\nknowledge bombs that Wes has\ndropped left and right on us today.\n\n679\n00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.540\nSo take that information and\nbe prepared for your A+ exam.\n\n680\n00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.510\nThat being said,\nwe're out of time in this episode,\n\n681\n00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.540\nwe'll be back with more though,\ndon't worry.\n\n682\n00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.350\nSigning off for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n683\n00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n684\n00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.039\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n685\n00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:41.603\n[MUSIC]\n\n686\n00:32:41.603 --> 00:32:44.323\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:10.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.085\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:16.305\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.543\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.543 --> 00:00:24.280\nit's all about the A+ accelerated course,\nbeen a very accelerated track so far.\n\n8\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.890\nJoining us back in the studio,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.240\nWes, welcome back, glad to have you again,\nhow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great as always.\n\n11\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.340\nIt's been a pleasure to be on\nthis journey here with you, Dan,\n\n12\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.840\nwith the accelerated track in A+.\n\n13\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.911\nNow we are gonna continue in through\nsecurity, we've been talking a little bit,\n\n14\n00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:42.865\nyou know in prior episodes about\nall kinds of things right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.869\nYou know the operating system, some of\nthe utilities and tools that you have and,\n\n16\n00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.200\nwe're going to kind of\nveer into security now.\n\n17\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.630\nSo, in this one, we're going to be looking\nat some of the threats that you may\n\n18\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.360\nface out there, in just information\nsecurity, some of the vulnerability and\n\n19\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.350\nthen we'll also talk about\na little bit about prevention too.\n\n20\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.340\nWe're going to take these topics, we're\ngoing to put them into a single episode,\n\n21\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.360\nand as we walk through them,\nyou might want to grab your tin foil hat.\n\n22\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.440\nThis might be a tin foil hat episode.\n\n23\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this can definitely raise the\nparanoia levels up to an all time high.\n\n24\n00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:17.130\nAnd, to be honest with you, it's not a bad\nthing as we say in this business paranoia\n\n25\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.059\npays, we've got data, we've got\npersonal information, we've got medical\n\n26\n00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:24.928\ninformation, things that do not need to\nget out, trade secrets you name it and\n\n27\n00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:28.385\nthere's a ton of bad guys out there\njust looking to get their hands on,\n\n28\n00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.589\nto make a profit unless we got to\nworry about this thing, right?\n\n29\n00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:35.904\n&gt;&gt; And we definitely do and,\nif you're first getting into the field,\n\n30\n00:01:35.904 --> 00:01:40.940\nunderstand that, your first line\nof defense is awareness, right?\n\n31\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.340\nIt's easy to say okay well your first line\nof defense is the lock on the front door.\n\n32\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850\nWell, why am I locking the front door,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.450\nSo again, user awareness is one of\nthe greatest things that you can do if\n\n34\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.420\nyou will, or even be a part of if\nyou're already in to the field and\n\n35\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.870\nyou're just looking for the certification\nthan you probably already know that.\n\n36\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.470\nUnderstand the next thing is not only\nuser awareness but communication, right?\n\n37\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.970\nAgain you have to communicate,\njust because I'm aware of something,\n\n38\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.820\nif I don't tell Dan,\nhey Dan we got to watch it you know.\n\n39\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.610\nIn fact that you know, I've just found out\nthat there is one acquire a ransomware\n\n40\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.060\nhas just it's running rampant right now.\n\n41\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.490\nWell, maybe Dan hasn't checked his phone,\nand I know this isn't the case.\n\n42\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.690\nBut maybe, Dan hasn't checked\nhis phone yet this morning,\n\n43\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.720\ndoesn't realize that this thing has\ntaken out the northeast, right?\n\n44\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.000\nSo, it's not only user awareness,\nit's also communication.\n\n45\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.860\nAnd it's constant research, and\n\n46\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.090\nit really is a very cyclic process\nwhen it comes to anything in security.\n\n47\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.600\nSo let's go ahead, and let's dive in and\nlet's talk about malware.\n\n48\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.440\nOkay now, I want you to understand\nthat malware is is an umbrella term.\n\n49\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.850\nAll right, when we talk about malware we\ntypically are talking about some kind\n\n50\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.630\nof code.\n\n51\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.200\nOkay, so just think about it.\n\n52\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.410\nAn operating system, program\nsoftware the DNA is the code, right?\n\n53\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.805\nMalware really is some\nkind of code that causes\n\n54\n00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:05.435\nsome undesired and\nunauthorized effect right?\n\n55\n00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.630\nYou can have bad programming and that\ncauses some kinda undesired effect, right?\n\n56\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.350\nAnd people might argue that certain\noperating systems can do that too,\n\n57\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.950\nbut unauthorized, right?\n\n58\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.510\nThat's one of the big things whether\nit's unauthorized access to your data.\n\n59\n00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.160\nAgain you couple that with again,\n\n60\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.600\njust this undesired effect and\nyou essentially have malware, right?\n\n61\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.550\nThere was times when we would say,\n\n62\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.770\nokay well lets put some antivirus\nsoftware on there, right?\n\n63\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.779\nWell we can't just say any virus software,\n\n64\n00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.560\neven though its called out of\nthe objectives they any virus.\n\n65\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.616\nToday it's gone, and\nI say today for years now it's gone\n\n66\n00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:48.107\nwell past just a virus your\ncomputer getting sick if you will.\n\n67\n00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:53.195\nBecause these pieces of malware out\nthere are very, very strategic.\n\n68\n00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:55.723\nThey can be very sophisticated.\n\n69\n00:03:55.723 --> 00:03:59.307\nAnd sometimes they can be a real nightmare\nand a pain to get off of your system.\n\n70\n00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:03.303\nSo understand that, first of all,\nwhen we talk about malware,\n\n71\n00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:08.270\nyou wanna have a full robust anti-malware\nsuite on your computer at all times.\n\n72\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.550\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n73\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.910\nlet's talk about some of the malware types\nthat you have to worry about, right?\n\n74\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.150\nOne of the first ones that I wanna mention\nwhen it comes to objectives is spyware.\n\n75\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.800\nSpyware is one of the easiest\nones to get on your system,\n\n76\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.510\nit can happen just by your\nbrowsing habits, right?\n\n77\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.310\nUnderstand that when we talk\nabout things like webpages,\n\n78\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.420\nthere's a lot of stuff on\na webpage that you don't see.\n\n79\n00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.910\nAll right, in fact, there's quite\na few and one of the things that I've\n\n80\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.820\nnoticed is just standing next to some of\nour marketing people in our dev team,\n\n81\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.830\nas they are talking, you just do not\nrealize how much goes into the webpage.\n\n82\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.600\nThe fact your end result is your\nviewing with in your web browser,\n\n83\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.530\nis a very small portion of whats\nactually going on behind the scenes.\n\n84\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.660\nI just say that because,\nI don't want you to think that\n\n85\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.680\nif you get spyware on your computer that\nit's something that you've done, and\n\n86\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.020\nyour users are really\nthe cause on this one.\n\n87\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.165\nIt could just be average web browsing,\nright?\n\n88\n00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:09.140\nLet's go in here, and\nI've got a little diagram.\n\n89\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.660\nWhat does spyware do for us, right?\n\n90\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.305\nOr do to us if you will, but it can do\nthings like monitoring your local data,\n\n91\n00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:16.823\nright?\n\n92\n00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:19.991\nThat's the big thing,\nit's just tracking you, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:22.260\nIt could monitor your web browsing, right.\n\n94\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.860\nWe could do things like\nmonitoring e-mail clients, and\n\n95\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.250\nhere's where it gets\na little bit more malicious.\n\n96\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.350\nCollecting your data and sending the data,\nnow that happens all the time today,\n\n97\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.400\nespecially when you talk about mobility,\nthe mobile markets,\n\n98\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.045\nwe have some episodes where we talk about\nlocation information, but it goes a little\n\n99\n00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:44.610\nbit farther than that, that now it could\nbe doing things like, for instance,\n\n100\n00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.010\nyou could have spyware that's collecting\nand reselling your information, right?\n\n101\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.680\nCorporations, if you will, can basically\nuse that information to turn around and\n\n102\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.210\nmarket stuff to you.\n\n103\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.280\nAnd it could be things even\nworse than that, right?\n\n104\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.280\nA very malicious purpose could be for\nthings like identity thieves, they try\n\n105\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.030\nto gain access to your information if\nyou will, so that's essentially spyware.\n\n106\n00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.770\nKeep in mind, that you could\nput adware in this category to,\n\n107\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.180\nnext to him, cause they are kind\nof like cousins to each other.\n\n108\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.790\nOne difference between the adware and\n\n109\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.230\nspyware, adware can have\ncharacteristics of spyware too.\n\n110\n00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.510\nBut a lot of times with adware,\nyou can almost tell that it's there,\n\n111\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.180\nbecause you'll start noticing things\nlike pop-ups come up on your screen,\n\n112\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.620\nright, as you browse and stuff.\n\n113\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.710\nAnd they're strategically placed, and\nthey get really tricky with this too.\n\n114\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.753\nOne of the things about a lot of the data\nthat's being scraped with spyware,\n\n115\n00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:44.732\ncan turn around and present you ads\nbased on things like browsing habits and\n\n116\n00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:45.700\nstuff like that.\n\n117\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.690\nThe legality of that, I guess we could\nprobably have a whole show on that,\n\n118\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.140\nand there probably would be people\non opposite sides of the fence,\n\n119\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.980\nbecause some people would say,\nhey, we get paid.\n\n120\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.000\nTo do stuff like that with advertisements,\nright?\n\n121\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.530\nAnd then other people can again,\ngo a little bit farther like that.\n\n122\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.760\nLike an identity scraping and\nstuff like that.\n\n123\n00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.353\nIt can lead you in to some problems,\nright?\n\n124\n00:07:09.353 --> 00:07:14.283\nSo make sure that if you have an anti\nmalware software that it checks for\n\n125\n00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:15.750\nthese locations.\n\n126\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.940\nA lot of times where we see it goes\npast just average data collection,\n\n127\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.020\nand just average advertisements,\nis when you notice that things\n\n128\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.840\nare downloaded to directories\nthat you don't expect, right?\n\n129\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.493\nNow we're going a little\nbit more malicious,\n\n130\n00:07:34.493 --> 00:07:37.080\nbecause for\ninstance inside of windows you do\n\n131\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.774\nhave locations that you can almost expect\nthat there's going to be some kind, and\n\n132\n00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:46.015\nlet me go ahead and fire-up my computer\nhere and show you what I mean here.\n\n133\n00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:49.853\nThere's gonna be some\nkind of locations that\n\n134\n00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:53.697\nI expect to see advertisement information.\n\n135\n00:07:53.697 --> 00:07:56.079\nOne of the places that I\nthink of is the user profile.\n\n136\n00:07:56.079 --> 00:08:01.039\nAnd in fact let me kinda log in here and\nshow you exactly what I mean.\n\n137\n00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.631\nThere are locations, like for instance,\n\n138\n00:08:03.631 --> 00:08:07.240\nInternet Explorer keeps temporary\ndata in a certain spot.\n\n139\n00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.938\nLike for instance if I open\nup File Explorer here and\n\n140\n00:08:10.938 --> 00:08:13.003\nwe go into the user profile.\n\n141\n00:08:13.003 --> 00:08:15.740\nLet me kinda zoom in so\nyou guys can see that, right?\n\n142\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.819\nAnd admin this just happens to\nbe the user profile that I'm in.\n\n143\n00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:20.453\nWell, you can't really see it, so\n\n144\n00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:24.280\nwe're gonna go to our folder options that\nwe've talked about in another episode.\n\n145\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.827\nAnd let's view some hidden files right?\n\n146\n00:08:26.827 --> 00:08:29.822\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nopen this up here and\n\n147\n00:08:29.822 --> 00:08:33.084\nwe'll show some hidden locations, right?\n\n148\n00:08:33.084 --> 00:08:34.333\nYou have app data.\n\n149\n00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:39.232\nThis is where our commonality is to\nsee things like temporary files and\n\n150\n00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:42.150\nstuff like that like Internet Explorer.\n\n151\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.887\nSo we go to local here and\nwe go to Temp, right?\n\n152\n00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:49.231\nI expect to see that there'll\nbe probably something that\n\n153\n00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:53.630\ncould track information here, right,\nso I will delete temporary files.\n\n154\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:59.331\nBut here is the problem,\nwhen these pieces of spyware.\n\n155\n00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:02.760\nWhen they start to move outside of that\nlocation, now we've got a potential for\n\n156\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.156\nsome kind of malicious nature.\n\n157\n00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:07.913\n&gt;&gt; Is that for\nthe purposes of avoiding detection?\n\n158\n00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:09.055\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah definitely.\n\n159\n00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:14.609\nLike for instance,\nwhen we talk about viruses, right?\n\n160\n00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:19.810\nViruses like to make themselves look like\nthey're not a malicious file, right?\n\n161\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.368\nI see things like iexplore, right?\n\n162\n00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:28.980\niexplore.exe is a legitimate executable\nif it's running from the system32 folder.\n\n163\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:36.198\nOr I believe it's system32 folder,\nyou can also see things like explorer.exe.\n\n164\n00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:39.514\nBut when I see it running\nfrom a temporary directory,\n\n165\n00:09:39.514 --> 00:09:44.306\nFile Explorer should not be running\nfrom a temporary directory like that, so\n\n166\n00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:49.564\nyou gotta kinda use that anti-malware\nsoftware to really track this information.\n\n167\n00:09:49.564 --> 00:09:52.952\nThe next thing that we have\nto worry about, are viruses.\n\n168\n00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:53.722\nAll right, and\n\n169\n00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:57.524\nthere are some characteristics about\nviruses that I want you to be aware of.\n\n170\n00:09:57.524 --> 00:10:01.100\nLike so for instance, I've got a little\ndiagram here, viruses need a host,\n\n171\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.659\nall right?\n\n172\n00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:06.417\nThat's one thing about that malware\nthat differentiates it from some of\n\n173\n00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:09.854\nthe other pieces of malware\nthat we will talk about.\n\n174\n00:10:09.854 --> 00:10:13.330\nIt needs a host to piggyback and\nget onto your system.\n\n175\n00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.101\nAnd viruses are definitely one of those\none, and to kinda go along with that\n\n176\n00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:22.116\ntrain of thought, that they like\nthe replicate themselves and\n\n177\n00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:26.987\nput themselves in areas that you wouldn't\nas a human being certainly look.\n\n178\n00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:31.995\nAnd then also to try to trick\nthe anti malware software to again,\n\n179\n00:10:31.995 --> 00:10:36.368\nto if it does find it a lot of\ntimes it duplicates itself.\n\n180\n00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:41.268\nIt does reduplication and then\nredistribute itself into other locations.\n\n181\n00:10:41.268 --> 00:10:42.669\nSo how do we get viruses, right?\n\n182\n00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:45.825\nWell, they can come from a lot\nof different sources, right?\n\n183\n00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:51.051\nThey could be Internet based which they\nalmost always are, but not always, right?\n\n184\n00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.336\nThey can be USB based.\n\n185\n00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:56.476\nThere's kind of a running joke even\nthough it's not really funny, but\n\n186\n00:10:56.476 --> 00:10:59.030\nthere's a running joke that we always say.\n\n187\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.992\nAnd I know you're very security minded.\n\n188\n00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:03.042\nWe talked about the USB based attack,\nright?\n\n189\n00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:08.285\nTaking that again a whole bunch of these\ncheap USBs and putting executable code\n\n190\n00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:13.300\nthat essentially, will do things\nlike autorun, autoplay, if you will.\n\n191\n00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.889\nAnd you spread them out\nthere in the parking lot.\n\n192\n00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:18.965\nSomebody goes, you must be USB drive.\n\n193\n00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:20.913\nI wonder what's on that, plugs it in.\n\n194\n00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:22.147\nWell, enjoy your virus now.\n\n195\n00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:25.572\nSo things like that can\nbe the cause of problems.\n\n196\n00:11:25.572 --> 00:11:29.819\nThe other one, too, if we can go back to\nthe slide here, is email based, right?\n\n197\n00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:30.830\nThat's another one, right?\n\n198\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.143\nWith attachments and stuff.\n\n199\n00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:36.758\nDon't open emails that have attachments,\nand don't even really be opening\n\n200\n00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:40.313\nemails where you don't know\nwhere they came from, right?\n\n201\n00:11:40.313 --> 00:11:42.803\nThat is something that can cause problems.\n\n202\n00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:45.071\nNow there can also be other\ninfected systems too.\n\n203\n00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:49.927\nIf there is a system that's infected, they\ncould be the source of the viruses too, so\n\n204\n00:11:49.927 --> 00:11:54.191\nyou might have a system that's on\nyour network that's already infected.\n\n205\n00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:58.357\nAnd again, the moment you plug it in,\nor maybe it's not on your network and\n\n206\n00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:02.146\nsomebody patches down your network or\njoins the wireless network.\n\n207\n00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:05.693\nAnd now, it's gonna be the source\nof spreading those viruses as well.\n\n208\n00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:07.229\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, is that, okay, so\n\n209\n00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:11.581\nwhat I've always understood between\nthe difference between a virus and a worm,\n\n210\n00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:14.853\nis that viruses require user\ninteraction for propagation.\n\n211\n00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:19.828\nI actually as a user have to double-click\non something, install something and\n\n212\n00:12:19.828 --> 00:12:23.030\nattach it to an email and\nsend to somebody else you.\n\n213\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.969\nAnd then you download that email, you\nlook at the attachment, you fire it off.\n\n214\n00:12:27.969 --> 00:12:29.957\nAnd lather, rinse, repeat.\n\n215\n00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:33.035\nThe worm, they're like more\nintelligent viruses, right?\n\n216\n00:12:33.035 --> 00:12:36.583\nThey basically have like\na mechanism that looks for\n\n217\n00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:40.554\na vulnerabilities without\nany user interaction at all.\n\n218\n00:12:40.554 --> 00:12:43.931\nOnce you spin it up and let it go it\njust searches the Internet looking for\n\n219\n00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:44.845\ntargets, right?\n\n220\n00:12:44.845 --> 00:12:46.315\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n221\n00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:47.632\nIn fact let's look at a diagram.\n\n222\n00:12:47.632 --> 00:12:51.314\nThat's one of the biggest things that\nyou have to worry about with worms.\n\n223\n00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:52.659\nThey don't need a host.\n\n224\n00:12:52.659 --> 00:12:54.320\nThey don't need a [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's what makes them so dangerous.\n\n225\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.219\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthat's one of the worst things.\n\n226\n00:12:56.219 --> 00:13:00.291\nThese are nasty little jokers,\nbecause they're self propagating,\n\n227\n00:13:00.291 --> 00:13:03.406\nself sufficient, and\nregenerating pieces of code.\n\n228\n00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:04.945\nThey don't need a host, right?\n\n229\n00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:06.942\nAll they need is a port of entry.\n\n230\n00:13:06.942 --> 00:13:10.985\nAnd when they find that port of entry,\nguess what they're gonna start doing?\n\n231\n00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:11.809\n&gt;&gt; Bringing the hammer down.\n\n232\n00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:12.795\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n233\n00:13:12.795 --> 00:13:14.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There gonna start\n\n234\n00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:15.492\nreplicating, all right?\n\n235\n00:13:15.492 --> 00:13:17.825\nSo let's go ahead, let's talk about this.\n\n236\n00:13:17.825 --> 00:13:21.715\nThey could be Internet based, they could\nbe USB based, they could be email based,\n\n237\n00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:23.439\nthey could be infected systems, but\n\n238\n00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:27.914\nthey could be just self sufficient sitting\nout on your network waiting for that port.\n\n239\n00:13:27.914 --> 00:13:31.069\nNow we see there's a hole in dam.\n\n240\n00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:33.042\nI've got my entrance mechanism.\n\n241\n00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:37.677\nAnd then one of the things that kind\nof they'll do is they'll consume disk\n\n242\n00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:41.437\nresources until you don't have\nany more hard drive space.\n\n243\n00:13:41.437 --> 00:13:46.804\nMemory utilization to the point where it\nliterally will crash your computer or\n\n244\n00:13:46.804 --> 00:13:49.334\ndo what we'll learn in networking.\n\n245\n00:13:49.334 --> 00:13:51.796\nIf you're going on to network plus,\ngoing on to security plus,\n\n246\n00:13:51.796 --> 00:13:54.136\nyou'll learn about things like\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n247\n00:13:54.136 --> 00:13:57.057\nWhere a worm can perform a denial\nof service cuz you're consuming all\n\n248\n00:13:57.057 --> 00:13:57.769\nthe resources.\n\n249\n00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:01.151\nThen what happens is I don't have any more\nmemory in the system, I don't have any\n\n250\n00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:04.116\nmore disk space in the system,\nguess what's gonna end up happening?\n\n251\n00:14:04.116 --> 00:14:07.533\nDan's a legitimate user coming to\nthe website, trying to buy a product or\n\n252\n00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:08.646\ncheck on information.\n\n253\n00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:09.259\nGuess what?\n\n254\n00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:13.567\nAccess is denied to him because this worm,\nthese jokers are sitting there\n\n255\n00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:16.984\non your device, and\njust consuming all of the resources.\n\n256\n00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:20.586\nAnother one they're really bad about,\nis because they are self-sufficient and\n\n257\n00:14:20.586 --> 00:14:23.680\nself-replicating, they can consume\nall of the network resources.\n\n258\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.033\nAnd please understand that we're\nnot talking a single host,\n\n259\n00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.556\nwe're talking a multitude of hosts, right?\n\n260\n00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:35.105\nVirus, like Dan said, it needs to be able,\nI need to send it to Dan, right?\n\n261\n00:14:35.105 --> 00:14:36.736\nI need to send it to another computer.\n\n262\n00:14:36.736 --> 00:14:38.744\nI need to plug it in, right?\n\n263\n00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.043\nWorms you don't need to.\n\n264\n00:14:40.043 --> 00:14:44.378\nIn fact,\nthere are worms reading a security blog.\n\n265\n00:14:44.378 --> 00:14:47.571\nThere are worms out there that have\nbeen out there on the backbone of\n\n266\n00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:49.067\nthe internet since the 90s.\n\n267\n00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:49.677\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty scary.\n\n268\n00:14:49.677 --> 00:14:51.954\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthey're not going anywhere and\n\n269\n00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:55.631\nthey never will go there until we\nhave the kill switch engage and why?\n\n270\n00:14:55.631 --> 00:14:59.253\nBecause they're self propagating now\nyou'll say, now wait a second here,\n\n271\n00:14:59.253 --> 00:15:00.713\ndo we have to worry about them?\n\n272\n00:15:00.713 --> 00:15:04.394\nWell a lot of them systems have been\nparched, some were parched 20 years ago.\n\n273\n00:15:04.394 --> 00:15:08.672\n&gt;&gt; If it's propagating that means that\nthey're vulnerable systems out there so\n\n274\n00:15:08.672 --> 00:15:13.400\nour course of action would be to don't use\na system that's vulnerable to those worms,\n\n275\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.471\nand eventually one day,\nit will extinguish the flame.\n\n276\n00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:17.419\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n277\n00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:20.377\nThat's why they say stay away\nfrom Legacy systems, why?\n\n278\n00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:24.755\nBecause Legacy systems, I can't do\npatch management for anymore, because,\n\n279\n00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:27.580\nguess what,\nthe vendor it's past its shelf life.\n\n280\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.981\nIt's not being supported anymore.\n\n281\n00:15:28.981 --> 00:15:33.590\nThat's why we have to worry about\npeople still running XP out there,\n\n282\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:39.010\npeople still running Windows 2000 and\npeople, what do you have against XP?\n\n283\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.627\nAbsolutely nothing,\nit was an amazing operating system,\n\n284\n00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:47.397\nit had a very good long shelf life if you\nwill, but the problem is it's long past\n\n285\n00:15:47.397 --> 00:15:52.314\nbeing serviced anymore so any attacks you\nget for XP, guess what, don't turn to\n\n286\n00:15:52.314 --> 00:15:57.133\nMicrosoft It's just not gonna happen,\nthey're not supporting it anymore.\n\n287\n00:15:57.133 --> 00:16:01.134\nOther things that we have to do, we have\nto worry about, we have to worry about\n\n288\n00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:05.138\nmechanisms that will actually allow all\nof these different bugs if you will,\n\n289\n00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:07.570\nto make their way into the system.\n\n290\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.850\nRight, so we got the next one here,\nthis one is called a Trojan Horse.\n\n291\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.870\nA trojan horse is one that looks benign.\n\n292\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.840\nIt doesn't look like it's a problem.\n\n293\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.980\nIn fact, you might not even\nsee anything happen at all.\n\n294\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.590\n&gt;&gt; It's a gift.\n\n295\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nyou got to have the cluttered gift cards.\n\n296\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.000\n&gt;&gt; Quite literally,\n\n297\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.600\nwhen he says it's a gift [LAUGH], we're\ntalking no T on the end of that, right?\n\n298\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.900\n&gt;&gt; There was so\n\n300\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.780\nmany of those that were\ngoing through where it says,\n\n301\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.760\nsend grandma an electronic card.\n\n302\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.500\nYou click on it, and a Command Prompt\ncomes up on your screen, disappears, and\n\n303\n00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.190\nwell, guess what?\n\n304\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.934\nYou've got something going on in\ncomputer you might not even [CROSSTALK].\n\n305\n00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:42.637\n&gt;&gt; You've just entered infection land-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:16:42.637 --> 00:16:43.915\n&gt;&gt; Population you.\n\n307\n00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:45.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n308\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.120\nSo again, Trojan horses usually pave\nthe way for additional attacks.\n\n309\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.880\nAnd when we say paving the way for an\nadditional attacks, they can essentially\n\n310\n00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.440\nlead all these other things that we\ntalk about to be on your computer.\n\n311\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.640\nCould be file scanners, botnets, right?\n\n312\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.360\nBotnet just being, in fact, botnets are\nusually propagated by things like Trojans.\n\n313\n00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.060\nA botnet is essentially a series of\ncomputers that has infected software,\n\n314\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.580\nmalicious software installed on them so\nthat an attacker or\n\n315\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.400\na group of attackers can\nremotely control those devices.\n\n316\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.590\nWhatever the device is.\n\n317\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.150\nNow you're saying now wait\na second what do you mean.\n\n318\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.340\nYou're not talking about computers.\n\n319\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.470\nWell in some aspects it's always\na computer operating system, but\n\n320\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.980\nit could be as something as\nSimple as a smart TV, all right?\n\n321\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.750\nAnd then they attack a single target.\n\n322\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.520\nLogic bombs, trojans can pave the way for\nlogic bombs.\n\n323\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.040\nYou know, a piece of malware that sits on\nyour computer and it waits for some kind\n\n324\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.690\nof trigger event, and when that trigger\nevent happens It attacks an endpoint.\n\n325\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.630\nAs well as spyware and even viruses too.\n\n326\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.370\nAll right, so those are some\nthings I definitely wanna mention.\n\n327\n00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.270\nThe next one I'll say that we also have to\nworry about is a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n328\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.030\nAll right,\nwhen we talk about man-in-the-middle\n\n329\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.510\nNot to forgetting our ladies out there.\n\n330\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.610\nIt could be ladies in the middle\nof attack as well, right?\n\n331\n00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.190\nWhat we're talking about is essentially\na person that has maliciously\n\n332\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.700\nput themselves in between two endpoints\nthat are communicating, right?\n\n333\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.265\nA lot of times you'll see it\n's things like servers, so for\n\n334\n00:18:15.265 --> 00:18:18.165\ninstance, lets say,\ndance administrator on the user,\n\n335\n00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:22.255\nI go to his website, I need to purchase\na product that his company supports.\n\n336\n00:18:22.255 --> 00:18:28.155\nThe hacker sits in between,\nunannounced to me,\n\n337\n00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:32.990\nscrapping information of the network,\nthe like a pocket capture utility.\n\n338\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.480\nAnd then essentially can do something\nas simple as eavesdropping, right?\n\n339\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.450\nRight now it's not always that simplistic,\nthere is some set-up but the point is\n\n340\n00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.540\nthey can see the information that's going\nfrom my computer to Dan's server, right?\n\n341\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.960\nAnd maybe this will pave the way for\nother types of attacks.\n\n342\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.030\nWhere because of the fact that that\nperson is now in-between my computer and\n\n343\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.640\nthe server, what they can do is\nthings like replay attacks, right,\n\n344\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.020\nwhere basically they\nscrape my information.\n\n345\n00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.870\nAnd later on when I'm no longer in\nthe picture, guess what they do?\n\n346\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.480\nThey replay it to the server and\nit looks like it's me, right.\n\n347\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.840\nWell, it could be session hijacking.\n\n348\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.680\nWhere they did that and essentially,\nIIm in between my computer here,\n\n349\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.670\nis in between the server.\n\n350\n00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.620\nWe're communicating.\n\n351\n00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.020\nWe're doing e-commerce.\n\n352\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.070\nAll of the sudden, I don't realize it but\nI'm kicked offline.\n\n353\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.760\nI think, I just had to reboot\nmy computer to reconnect.\n\n354\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.880\nAnd again, I don't realize that\nwhat's happening is the person\n\n355\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.000\nthat is attacking me is now\nin between my session and\n\n356\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.910\nit looks to the server like\nthey're the legitimate person.\n\n357\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.700\nAnd unfortunately they're doing things\non my behalf and I dont even know.\n\n358\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.130\nSo we gotta worry about things\nlike man in the middle attacks.\n\n359\n00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.780\nThere's another one in here\nI wanna kinda mention too.\n\n360\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.337\nAnd this is a zero day, a zero day attack.\n\n361\n00:19:50.337 --> 00:19:56.169\nWith a Zero-day attack,\nunderstand that it's interesting,\n\n362\n00:19:56.169 --> 00:20:02.190\nzero-day can actually be\na long drawn out span of time.\n\n363\n00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.340\nA lot of times what they boil zero day\nattacks down to is the fact when your\n\n364\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:12.960\nsecurity of a certain functionality or\na certain piece of your operating system\n\n365\n00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:19.270\nhas been exposed to attack that nobody's\naware of, the vendors aren't aware of it.\n\n366\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.980\nWell, I can't technically say nobody,\nthe attackers are aware of it.\n\n367\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:28.120\nAnd it actually follows a time line\nbecause people a vulnerability\n\n368\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.890\nwas introduced into the wild,\nisn't that zero-day?\n\n369\n00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.440\nNo, no, we could have vulnerabilities\non the website right now, and\n\n370\n00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.840\nwe're not aware of it, and\nthe attackers aren't aware of it.\n\n371\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840\nIt's not gonna hurt me none, right?\n\n372\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.020\n&gt;&gt; Because there's no actual\nthreat at that point,\n\n373\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.130\nbecause no one can do anything with it\ncuz they don't even know it exists.\n\n374\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.920\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, so\nbe careful on the timeline on here,\n\n375\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.680\nbecause once the vulnerability\nis discovered, you say, well,\n\n376\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.380\nwait a second, now you have to worry.\n\n377\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.450\nWell, you have to worry, but\nyou're still not in the zero day zone.\n\n378\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.950\nJust because theoretically there's\na possibility that this is vulnerable,\n\n379\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.750\nis there a way to exploit it?\n\n380\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.200\nRight?\nWe say, okay, I've got 4096.\n\n381\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.490\nSo, 4,096 bits of encryption and you say,\n20 years from now that's gonna be weak.\n\n382\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.520\nWell, that's 20 years from now.\n\n383\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.280\nJust because a vulnerability\nis discovered doesn't\n\n384\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.040\nmean that I'm actually worried yet.\n\n385\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.840\nThe vulnerability exploit\nhas been discovered.\n\n386\n00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.390\nNow you're in zero day.\n\n387\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.150\nRight?\nNow you're in zero day.\n\n388\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.220\nAnd again, I kind of move these lines.\n\n389\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.550\nSome people might move this\na little bit closer to here.\n\n390\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.180\nWhen the vulnerability is discovered and\nthe exploit is implemented.\n\n391\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.500\nNow we definitely have to\nworry about some things.\n\n392\n00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.990\nNow our security in this system is at its\nlowest point, but then it keeps going on.\n\n393\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.880\nA lot of people like to forget about\nthe aftermath of a zero day because then\n\n394\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.900\nthere's vendor awareness.\n\n395\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.530\nAnd notice you're still in the red here.\n\n396\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.130\nWe're not green lighted yet, right?\n\n397\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.680\nThen the vendor has to do patch\ndevelopment, whatever the patch is for\n\n398\n00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.470\nthe security vulnerability.\n\n399\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.840\nThen we have to worry about\nthe patches released.\n\n400\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.910\nAnd we're still in the red here, right?\n\n401\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.480\nThen there's user awareness.\n\n402\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.650\nNow when there's user awareness,\npeople are becoming aware that hey,\n\n403\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:15.650\nthere's a patch out there.\n\n404\n00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.760\nWe need to apply it to our systems, but\nagain, we'll still not in the green.\n\n405\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.980\nIt's only until the patched systems\ncome out that we can start saying,\n\n406\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.020\nokay, now our systems are secure.\n\n407\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.180\nIt's kind of like those worms\nthat we were talking about, Dan,\n\n408\n00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.530\nthat have been around forever, right?\n\n409\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.400\nWhy am I considered to be in\nthe green already for those right.\n\n410\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.270\nWell because there were patches\non systems these are legacy\n\n411\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.820\noperating systems I'm not running them.\n\n412\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.810\nSo again just kind of keep in\nmind see what zero day yes.\n\n413\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.790\nAll right now some of the things that I\nwant you all to be aware of to all right.\n\n414\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.650\nWe have what's known as ransomware.\n\n415\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.310\nAll right, ransomware essentially\nis a type of malware, if you will,\n\n416\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.410\nthat'll lock down your computer.\n\n417\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.760\nAll right,\nnow when it locks down your computer,\n\n418\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.250\nwhat ends up happening is you have to send\nmoney over the internet to some kind of\n\n419\n00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.420\nyou know, a bad guy if you will,\nattacker, pay them money so\n\n420\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.730\nthat they'll give you the encryption\nkeys to unlock your data.\n\n421\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.620\nYou also have what is known\nas rogue antivirus, and\n\n422\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.920\nwhat I like to call scareware.\n\n423\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.340\nYou've probably seen some of these, and we\ndefinitely have to be aware of them too.\n\n424\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.660\nWhen we say rogue any virus and\nscare ware.\n\n425\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.720\nThink about a time you may have gotten\nany malware scam that's popped up and\n\n426\n00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:38.360\nit lets you know, you've got 149 viruses\nlike it's doing you some kind of favor.\n\n427\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.060\nIn order to get those viruses off,\nyou actually have to pay for the software.\n\n428\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.235\nWhat it does is it reduces\nthe functionality of your computer, right?\n\n429\n00:23:46.235 --> 00:23:50.601\nYou can't get to certain things,\nyou can't open administrative tasks or\n\n430\n00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:53.733\nanything like that,\nbecause it's blocking those.\n\n431\n00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:55.809\nWell, that's that's rogue antivirus.\n\n432\n00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.385\nWe have to worry about that.\n\n433\n00:23:57.385 --> 00:24:00.780\n&gt;&gt; They were a real pain in the mid 2000s.\n\n434\n00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; They were a hammer to everybody because\n\n435\n00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.910\nthey look so legit and it did.\n\n436\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.390\nPeople are just downloading left and\nright and and paying money.\n\n437\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the one's [INAUDIBLE]\nyeah same time lines, I agree.\n\n438\n00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.970\nAnd one of the ones that kept hitting our\nsales floor of a company that I worked for\n\n439\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.240\nwas called the AV suite.\n\n440\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.052\nIt looked like the AA-\n&gt;&gt; I remember it.\n\n441\n00:24:19.052 --> 00:24:20.551\n&gt;&gt; It was the AV suite.\n\n442\n00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:24.360\nAnd anti-virus suite, if you will.\n\n443\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.470\nAnother one that got me in for attack,\nand here's where user awareness comes in,\n\n444\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.880\nfor attack we would laugh at this.\n\n445\n00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.725\nWas Microsoft Security Essentials and\nit wanted you to pay.\n\n446\n00:24:33.725 --> 00:24:36.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See you can hear Dan in the background.\n\n447\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.640\nThe reason he's laughing is that he\nalready knows that was a free software\n\n448\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.100\nthat Microsoft puts out to\nintegrate into Windows 7, so\n\n449\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.580\nyou don't pay for it, it's free.\n\n450\n00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.210\nThey want you to, and\nit updates with Windows Update.\n\n451\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.310\nThat would have been the telltale sign\nthat you shouldn't be paying for this for\n\n452\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.120\none if there's a problem.\n\n453\n00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.340\nOther ones we have too.\n\n454\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.590\nWe say Scareware.\n\n455\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.220\nIf we look here, the FBI warning.\n\n456\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.180\nThat's another one.\n\n457\n00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.250\nThat's a big one.\n\n458\n00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:07.610\nSomebody gets it and it won't let you\ndo anything else, that's Scareware.\n\n459\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.590\nThat gives you that reduced\nfunctionality as well,\n\n460\n00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.620\nreduces the functionality of your machine.\n\n461\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.290\nThings like browser hijacks and\n\n462\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:19.590\nredirections, will only send you to\none place if you pay their money.\n\n463\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:24.740\nThese are all forms of malware\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n464\n00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.700\nNow, other things that can cause\nproblems are Social Engineering.\n\n465\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.160\nAnd let's just talk about a few of these\nsocial engineering types real quick.\n\n466\n00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.750\nWe have phishing, and\nwe have spear phishing.\n\n467\n00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.260\nPhishing is one of the most\ncommon scams there is out there.\n\n468\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.990\nIt is a multi-billion dollar industry, and\nit has been for quite a few years running.\n\n469\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.830\nI don't know how many,\nI don't have any statistics here, but\n\n470\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.180\nyou've probably seen this.\n\n471\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.950\nThis is when you get that\nemail from your one and\n\n472\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.987\nonly brother from another mother in\nNigerian country who is a prince,\n\n473\n00:25:52.987 --> 00:25:57.260\nand wants to send you a gazillion dollars\nas long as you will send that person\n\n474\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.267\nyour banking information so\nthey can wire you over the first Million.\n\n475\n00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:03.342\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Spear phishing is a targeted phishing\n\n476\n00:26:03.342 --> 00:26:03.870\nattack.\n\n477\n00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:08.197\nAgain, this is where one that kind of\nlooks like it's coming from a legitimate\n\n478\n00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:08.730\nsource.\n\n479\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.190\nTailgating is another one.\n\n480\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.000\nTailgating and piggybacking can kind of\nseem pretty much like the same thing.\n\n481\n00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.030\nIf you think of a tailgating attack\none of the things that I think about,\n\n482\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:25.240\ncuz I live in an apartment complex,\nis when I go\n\n483\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.810\ninto my apartment complex after I swipe\nmy card cuz it's a gated community.\n\n484\n00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.650\nAnd a car comes behind me and\nfollows right in.\n\n485\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.910\nWell, that can happen when I'm looking\nover at the door, you guys can't see it.\n\n486\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.785\nThey're probably, why is he\npointing over to the corner there?\n\n487\n00:26:36.785 --> 00:26:37.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the studio,\n\n488\n00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.030\nI'm thinking of the door here.\n\n489\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.890\nIf you have an authenticated door and as\nthat door is closing somebody goes through\n\n490\n00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.497\nit and they are unauthorized, that's\na tailgating attack, that can happen.\n\n491\n00:26:46.497 --> 00:26:49.080\nImpersonation, impersonation\nis another one,\n\n492\n00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.150\nwhere you have somebody that is basically\nimpersonating maybe an administrator,\n\n493\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.460\nmaybe it's not even an administrator.\n\n494\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.160\nMaybe it's somebody that says hey you\nknow, they walk into the company and\n\n495\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.820\nthey say, hey I'm here to fix the AC.\n\n496\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.620\nSomebody's not checking like an entry\ncontrol roster, somebody's not asking,\n\n497\n00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.750\nhey, what's your POC,\nwho's your Point of Contact here?\n\n498\n00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.495\nGive me a name, or your company,\ncan I have a number for that company so\n\n499\n00:27:11.495 --> 00:27:12.965\nI can call and just verify?\n\n500\n00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:17.870\nAnd now they potentially have\naccess to your building.\n\n501\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:22.720\nDan, you had mentioned the Walmart\none that had ended up happening.\n\n502\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.310\nThat was I believe like an AC, like I\nhad that company, maybe it wasn't you.\n\n503\n00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.800\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't me, yeah.\n\n504\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.710\n&gt;&gt; There was one with the you know\nthat where they had store all of these\n\n505\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.930\npeople's identity and stuff like that and\n\n506\n00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.330\nI believe they gained access to their\nnetwork because it was unchecked havoc\n\n507\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.770\nrepair company and ended up getting\nphysical access into their network.\n\n508\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.700\nSo we have to worry\nabout things like that.\n\n509\n00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.240\nDumpster diving,\nwhy is dumpster diving something?\n\n510\n00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.040\nI mean, you are literally,\nit's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n511\n00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.350\nBut why is dumpster diving some of it so\nsuccessfully?\n\n512\n00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.580\nI want you to think of things like\nthe calendars, the big desk calendars.\n\n513\n00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.600\nPeople write scratch information\nover there all the time.\n\n514\n00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.500\nWell, those are a great source of\ninformation because when the calendar is\n\n515\n00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.370\nthrough, what do you do?\n\n516\n00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.480\nYou throw it out, you put another one.\n\n517\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.370\nWriting down,\n\n518\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.850\npeople love to write passwords down,\nthey love to write phone numbers down.\n\n519\n00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:17.339\nWorse they like to write down\npersonally identifiable information,\n\n520\n00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:19.092\npayment card information.\n\n521\n00:28:19.092 --> 00:28:21.350\nAnd that stuff makes its\nway out with the trash.\n\n522\n00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.095\nShoulder surfing, shoulder surfing\nis exactly what it sounds like.\n\n523\n00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:30.195\nIt is me looking over your shoulder,\nATM based attack where they have somebody\n\n524\n00:28:30.195 --> 00:28:34.185\nthat is trying to see if they can see\nyour pin, let alone what your typing.\n\n525\n00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:36.485\nThat's why they say if your\nout there shopping and\n\n526\n00:28:36.485 --> 00:28:40.272\nyour going to put in your pin to\nyour credit card, you try to hide\n\n527\n00:28:40.272 --> 00:28:43.512\nit a little bit better cuz you don't want\nsomebody looking over your shoulder.\n\n528\n00:28:43.512 --> 00:28:45.662\nWorst case scenario you don't even know,\nand\n\n529\n00:28:45.662 --> 00:28:49.032\nunder their arm they've got their phone\nand it's zoomed into what you're doing.\n\n530\n00:28:49.032 --> 00:28:51.852\nThey're taking pictures just over,\nand over, and over.\n\n531\n00:28:51.852 --> 00:28:54.852\nHave the shutter sound turned off, and\nyou don't even know that they've been just\n\n532\n00:28:54.852 --> 00:28:58.752\nprofiling the whole time you were\npushing those however many digits.\n\n533\n00:28:58.752 --> 00:28:59.509\n&gt;&gt; Sneaky little buggers.\n\n534\n00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:00.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n535\n00:29:00.485 --> 00:29:04.885\nSo definitely watch that.\n\n536\n00:29:04.885 --> 00:29:07.575\nSome of the things that we can do for\nprevention,\n\n537\n00:29:07.575 --> 00:29:09.550\nlet's talk about that real quick.\n\n538\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:17.330\nI know as we're running low on time,\nfirewalls.\n\n539\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:22.200\nMaking sure that you're preventing\nunauthorized communications\n\n540\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.400\nwhether it's a host like the windows\nfirewall, whether it's a network\n\n541\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.150\nfirewall that is scanning all of\nthe traffic coming across your network.\n\n542\n00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.482\nDisabling unused ports,\nremember we talked about the worm.\n\n543\n00:29:33.482 --> 00:29:38.049\nSelf-propagation, self-propagating piece\nof code, things like authentication.\n\n544\n00:29:38.049 --> 00:29:41.462\nMaking sure that you're\nrequiring authentication,\n\n545\n00:29:41.462 --> 00:29:44.470\nincluding things like strong passwords.\n\n546\n00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.490\nSmart cart authentication is something\nthat you want to worry about.\n\n547\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.110\nMulti-factor, more than\none authentication factor.\n\n548\n00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.300\nSomething you know is being a password or\nsomething you have being whether\n\n549\n00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.050\nit a car or biometrics authentication,\nbeing something you are.\n\n550\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.760\nThose three authentication factors,\nRFID badges,\n\n551\n00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.420\nI've mentioned, key fobs,\ntokens if you will.\n\n552\n00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.610\nWe'd already mention\naccess control rosters.\n\n553\n00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.540\nACL's an access control list.\n\n554\n00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.965\nCould be electronic access control\nlists like permissions on your files.\n\n555\n00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:20.994\nGoing ahead and making sure that if\nsomebody is going to gain access to\n\n556\n00:30:20.994 --> 00:30:25.870\na network share you would only give them\nthe access that they're supposed to have.\n\n557\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.870\nThe principle of least privilege.\n\n558\n00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.710\nI only give you the privileges that you\nneed to accomplish your task whether it's\n\n559\n00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.750\na daily task, whether it's an ongoing\na task, part of your job, but no more.\n\n560\n00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.912\nYou don't get more access\nthan what you need.\n\n561\n00:30:38.912 --> 00:30:43.930\nUsing VPNs, if we're going over\npublic networks, we don't want\n\n562\n00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.220\npeople being able to eavesdrop on\nour information that's important.\n\n563\n00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.576\nIf we talk about physical security,\nlocking doors, man traps,\n\n564\n00:30:52.576 --> 00:30:56.935\neven the little turnstile that\nholds the next person in place, so\n\n565\n00:30:56.935 --> 00:30:59.570\nthey can't do piggybacking attacks.\n\n566\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:05.384\nOr one that's even more than that where\nyou have a public access door that opens,\n\n567\n00:31:05.384 --> 00:31:07.790\nallows somebody into a hallway.\n\n568\n00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:13.310\nThat public access door closes, and then\nthey authenticate to a secure area door.\n\n569\n00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.670\nAnd it closes before\nthe first one opens again.\n\n570\n00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.960\nSecuring your physical documents as well.\n\n571\n00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.680\nIf it happens to be paper-based media,\n\n572\n00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.740\nwe're not leaving documents\nsitting on the printer.\n\n573\n00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:30.280\nYeah so I think that's pretty much it\nright just remember that physical security\n\n574\n00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.340\nuser awareness first.\n\n575\n00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.350\nUser awareness policies and procedures.\n\n576\n00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.870\nAnd then the next one when we talk about\na multi-layer defense system, defense and\n\n577\n00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.940\ndepth is the physical security.\n\n578\n00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.960\nDon't overlook these things\nbecause there's threats out there.\n\n579\n00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.418\nYou need to know the vulnerabilities, but\n\n580\n00:31:45.418 --> 00:31:47.430\nyou also need to know how to prevent them,\nas well.\n\n581\n00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:52.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well definitely pass\nme a roll of that tinfoil over there,\n\n582\n00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.770\nbecause I've definitely got my ire raised.\n\n583\n00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:59.410\nThere are a lot of bad things that\nare waiting to take advantage of\n\n584\n00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.990\npeople with good intentions.\n\n585\n00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.380\nYou just think of,\nlike Wes is talking about, awareness,\n\n586\n00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.110\nthey're unaware that these\nthings exist out there.\n\n587\n00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.850\nIn such a nice looking wrapper as well,\n\n588\n00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:14.210\nthey do such a good job of\nmaking it look legitimate.\n\n589\n00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.580\nAlways question, always look for\n\n590\n00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.738\ntelltale signs of illegitimacy so\nthat you can stop it.\n\n591\n00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:26.170\nAnd if in doubt at all, make sure that you\nask somebody above you that would know.\n\n592\n00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.502\nAnd if they don't know, have them go\nto somebody else before you do anything\n\n593\n00:32:29.502 --> 00:32:32.212\nwhen it comes to attachments,\nfiles, plugging in USBs which\n\n594\n00:32:32.212 --> 00:32:35.520\nyou found in the parking lot,\nthat kind of thing, very important stuff.\n\n595\n00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.371\nWes, anything else you wanna\ncover before we call it a day?\n\n596\n00:32:37.371 --> 00:32:41.630\n&gt;&gt; No I just want to kind of just say one\nmore thing based on what you said wrapping\n\n597\n00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:46.512\nit up here, that's why the spear fishing\nattack is so successful, it's a gift wrap.\n\n598\n00:32:46.512 --> 00:32:48.067\nThat's what made me think of it,\n\n599\n00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:51.253\nit looks like its coming from\nsomebody you know and trust.\n\n600\n00:32:51.253 --> 00:32:54.215\nSo, that e-mail,\nI've gotta go ahead and open it, and\n\n601\n00:32:54.215 --> 00:32:56.895\nthen it causes a world of problems,\nI just wanted to throw that in there.\n\n602\n00:32:56.895 --> 00:33:01.058\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good information and\ngood words of wisdom and caution.\n\n603\n00:33:01.058 --> 00:33:03.489\nSo take heed to them and\nfollow these practice and\n\n604\n00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:06.276\nprocedures that will help you\nstay out of the darkness,\n\n605\n00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:09.268\nout of the weeds and\nyour computer clean and your data safe.\n\n606\n00:33:09.268 --> 00:33:10.581\nWes, thanks so much for dropping by.\n\n607\n00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:12.766\nWe appreciate your time and\neffort as always and\n\n608\n00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:16.135\nwe I appreciate our good audience\nout there for joining us as well.\n\n609\n00:33:16.135 --> 00:33:19.275\nDon't worry, we got plenty of more of\nour A+ accelerated concept to come.\n\n610\n00:33:19.275 --> 00:33:21.515\nAs for this episode, though,\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n611\n00:33:21.515 --> 00:33:24.165\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n612\n00:33:24.165 --> 00:33:24.915\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n613\n00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:26.709\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n614\n00:33:26.709 --> 00:33:32.003\n[MUSIC]\n\n615\n00:33:32.003 --> 00:33:36.125\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.944\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.718\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:16.392\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:20.664\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode will guess what we are returning\n\n7\n00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:22.779\nwith more in our A+ accelerated series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.860\nHopefully you've been enjoying that,\nI know I sure have.\n\n9\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.400\nJoining us back in the studio to\nhelp enjoy that a little bit more,\n\n10\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.980\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.480\nWes, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.570\nYou know what, this is as we've been\ngetting into security with these\n\n14\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.950\nlast couple of episodes, we've\nalready had our tin foil hat episode.\n\n15\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.900\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll take our tin foil hat off and\n\n16\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.870\nwe'll keep moving along in security.\n\n17\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.450\nAnd well kinda show you\nsome basics when it comes\n\n18\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.200\nto keeping your workstation secure.\n\n19\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.640\nNow, understand that some of\nthis is gonna be about Windows.\n\n20\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.790\nIn fact a lot of it you're\ngonna see as we demonstrate.\n\n21\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.820\nIt's gonna be in Windows,\n\n22\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.810\nbut please understand that when it comes\nto workstation security, a computer\n\n23\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.280\noperating system is a computer operating\nsystem, is an operating system, right?\n\n24\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.720\nIt doesn't matter which one you're\nrunning, a lot of these practices,\n\n25\n00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.180\nit doesn't atter if it's Windows.\n\n26\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.880\nIt doesn't matter if it's the Mac\noperating system that we have here.\n\n27\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.840\nDoesn't matter if it's something like\nDan spends the majority of his time\n\n28\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.590\nin right Linux operating system.\n\n29\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.860\nOr if you're like one of our other\nhosts Don that spends a lot of time\n\n30\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.140\nin Unix systems as well, right?\n\n31\n00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.070\nIt applies to every machine\nthat you will run into, right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550\nSo some of it is generic okay and\n\n33\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.120\nplease understand that while we will be\nshowing you from the Windows perspective.\n\n34\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.773\nWhen it comes to a password,\nwell, guess what,\n\n35\n00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:41.742\na password is something you're gonna\nset in all the operating systems.\n\n36\n00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:45.877\nIt doesn't matter which one it might be,\nthe rules still apply, so\n\n37\n00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:49.008\nthat's some of the things\nwe're going to look at.\n\n38\n00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.522\nBut as you've already seen,\nwhen it comes to the A+ exam,\n\n39\n00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:55.910\nit is very Windows-centric.\n\n40\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.510\nSo we will show you some things that are\nspecific to Windows just so that you're\n\n41\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.970\naware and if they put you in a scenario\non an exam, you'll be ready for it.\n\n42\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.320\nSo let's go ahead and\nwithout further ado, ludacris speed go.\n\n43\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.950\nLet's dive right in and let's talk\nabout well, work stations security.\n\n44\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.720\nOne of the very first\nthings that we mention,\n\n45\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.580\nour first line of defense is a password.\n\n46\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.740\nMaking sure that you're\nrequiring passwords.\n\n47\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.480\nThat's one of the things that's called\nout when it comes to the exam objectives.\n\n48\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.870\nThey say requiring passwords.\n\n49\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.250\nNow it's too very simple.\n\n50\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.510\nBut believe or not,\n\n51\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.880\nnot every home user actually requires\npasswords to log on to their computer.\n\n52\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.480\nNow people are getting better and\nbetter in today's age that, yeah,\n\n53\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.080\na lot of people are, but\nagain, not every computer\n\n54\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.500\nout there that maybe you've run in\nto requires you to enter a password.\n\n55\n00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.230\nNow in our industry, Dan.\n\n56\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.120\nI know that we would look at that and\nsay no.\n\n57\n00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.882\nThat can't even be on\nmy network like that.\n\n58\n00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:53.060\nSo for people that are in the field,\n\n59\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.440\nand people that are doing maybe\nyou work with computers every day.\n\n60\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.700\nThat does seem like well\nthat's a no brainer.\n\n61\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.180\nWell it's not always the case.\n\n62\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.847\n&gt;&gt; I like how you use that word,\nrequires you to use a password.\n\n63\n00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:08.220\nDoesn't mean that there aren't password\nmechanisms in the operating system,\n\n64\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.760\nit just means that they're not\nasking you to use them at all.\n\n65\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.956\nBecause you might be a home user and\nyou just open your computer,\n\n66\n00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:16.690\nturn it on or whatever the case is,\nand you're there.\n\n67\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.250\nYou use it.\n\n68\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.900\nYou don't have multi users there.\n\n69\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.905\nBut that could still be\na dangerous practice, right?\n\n70\n00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:25.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really can, and I've seen\ncomputers where you just walk over and\n\n71\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.850\nwiggle the mouse and, boy, you're in,\nso you got to always require a password.\n\n72\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.570\nThe other thing we want to do is\nwe want to require things like\n\n73\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.180\nstrong passwords, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.900\nSo what is a strong password?\n\n75\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.934\nMan, that is a object of debate.\n\n76\n00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:40.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Much contested.\n\n77\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is, absolutely.\n\n78\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.040\nAnd there's different sides of\nthe river and you can jump.\n\n79\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.350\nYou could swim as well.\n\n80\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.980\nBut again, strong password is\nsomething we're gonna talk about.\n\n81\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.480\n&gt;&gt; I actually think I figured it out.\n\n82\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.560\nAnd I think the contention comes in\nfrom there are people that talk about,\n\n83\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.190\nyou need a long password, that's all that\nmatters is the length of the password.\n\n84\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.240\nAnd the other people say, no, no, no, it's\ncharacter set, you have to mix things up,\n\n85\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.890\nyou got to do this, you got to do that.\n\n86\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.030\nI think, what it boils down to is there\nare two types of password attack.\n\n87\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.400\nYou have dictionary attacks,\nyou have brute force attacks.\n\n88\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.430\nDictionary is just like it sounds,\n\n89\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.950\nit's just a list of words that tries each\none of them to see if it can break in.\n\n90\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.250\nOne to one kind of thing, right?\n\n91\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.330\nBrute forces, just try every\ncombination of this character set and\n\n92\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.930\nsee if you can find a password for\nsaid username.\n\n93\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.530\nLong passwords work great for brute force.\n\n94\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.600\nThe longer the password,\nthe longer the brute force takes.\n\n95\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.670\nAnd therefore more security, right?\n\n96\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.070\nThe ones with the weird character sets\nnot typically found in a dictionary, so\n\n97\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.400\nthey're great for that.\n\n98\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.110\nI like to combine the two, so\nthat I protect both against dictionary and\n\n99\n00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.770\nbrute force.\n\n100\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.850\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and you know what?\n\n101\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.040\nI like what you're mentioning,\ncharacter sets.\n\n102\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.280\nSo what's Dan talking about?\n\n103\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.540\nWell, I just want you to take a second and\nlook down at your keyboard.\n\n104\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.850\nWhen it comes to a character set,\n\n105\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.930\nyou have,\nwell essentially four character sets.\n\n106\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.030\nYou have A through Z, but\nalso lower case and upper case,\n\n107\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.800\nthose are two characters sets.\n\n108\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.880\nYou have numbers and\nthat's just 0 through 9.\n\n109\n00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.590\nAnd I'm not going to sit here and list all\nthe last one, we have special characters.\n\n110\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.716\nYour ampersand, punctuation marks and\nstuff like that.\n\n111\n00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:16.384\nSo when he says like dictionary\nattacks increase character sets.\n\n112\n00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:19.800\nMultiple character sets means that if I'm\ngoing to spell something maybe I'll put\n\n113\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.690\na at symbol in there.\n\n114\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.748\nOr maybe I don't spell anything because\nthat could be in the dictionary,\n\n115\n00:05:23.748 --> 00:05:25.930\nthat's words,\nhence the term dictionary attack.\n\n116\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.310\nLength as well, that's something we\nwant to require, you want to require.\n\n117\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.370\nI don't want a password of 1234, 12345.\n\n118\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.530\nI don't one of 1 though 9, or\nyou get a nine character password,\n\n119\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.270\nall right that's nine characters.\n\n120\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.190\nThe problem is, that's very easy to guess.\n\n121\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.140\nSo something like a brute force might\nget right through that right away.\n\n122\n00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.000\nSo we do wanna make sure that\nwe'll require strong a password.\n\n123\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.160\nPassword expiration,\nthat's something that's important, right?\n\n124\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.510\nWe say well what's important about that?\n\n125\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.210\nWell think about let's just take the two\nattacks, and there's plenty of them.\n\n126\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.830\nHe didn't bombard you\nwith all the ones and\n\n127\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.390\nif you guys want check out some of our\nsecurity episodes that we have this week.\n\n128\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.020\nGot a lot in the library at ITProTV.\n\n129\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.170\nThere are so\nmany different types of password attacks.\n\n130\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.170\nThose just happen to be two\nvery popular ones, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.080\nSo imagine the ability to\nkeep the guessing game going.\n\n132\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.080\nThe fact that you use a password,\n30 days later it changes.\n\n133\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.000\nWell guess what?\n\n134\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.280\nThat only gives a hacker 30 days\n\n135\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.030\nto potentially perform some attack\nbefore the password's gonna change.\n\n136\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.010\nWe also go a little bit farther than that,\nsometimes it can be very strict.\n\n137\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.930\nIf it's an administrative lower privileged\naccount, a root user type account.\n\n138\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.540\nAgain, this is generic.\n\n139\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.070\nWe're not talking a Windows administrator,\n\n140\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.130\nI'm talking root users in\nmixed base systems, as well.\n\n141\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.190\nMaybe you only allow that one for\n10 days, or 15 days.\n\n142\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.580\nWhatever the strict might be.\n\n143\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.170\nRight now you've shortened\nthat window of opportunity for\n\n144\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.100\nthe attack to be successful, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.730\nChanging defaults,\nthat's something you always wanna do.\n\n146\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.340\nIt's a common practice that basically\nwhen you create somebody's account,\n\n147\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.450\nmaybe in the onboarding process,\nthat you leave a default password.\n\n148\n00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.890\nAnd you email that to them.\n\n149\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.390\nOr maybe it's part of\nthe on boarding process and\n\n150\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.560\nobviously you may not even\nwant to be emailing it,\n\n151\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.290\nmaybe they just tell it in an audible or\na physical confirmation.\n\n152\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.440\nHere's what your password is.\n\n153\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.530\nThen it requires you to change that\npassword after you've logged on.\n\n154\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.620\nWell why would an administrator\nif I have set your password,\n\n155\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.070\nif Dan set the password.\n\n156\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.050\nWhy would the administrator want\nyou to change your password?\n\n157\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.140\nWell that's because administrators\ndon't need your password.\n\n158\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.060\nThey shouldn't have your passwords too.\n\n159\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.310\nAdministrators are not immune to\nthe security policies that they have\n\n160\n00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.780\nto enforce.\n\n161\n00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.603\nIt should be something only you know.\n\n162\n00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:54.893\nAnd when it comes down to it, an\nadministrator doesn't need your password\n\n163\n00:07:54.893 --> 00:07:58.358\ncuz they can reset it to something they\nknow and get into your account anyways.\n\n164\n00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:00.027\nSo We change defaults.\n\n165\n00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:02.762\nWe steer away from defaults.\n\n166\n00:08:02.762 --> 00:08:06.895\nThings like password based lock screens\nare very, very important as well, right?\n\n167\n00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:10.470\nPassword enabled or\npassword based screen savers.\n\n168\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.729\nWe a lot of times don't have to worry\nabout the burn in effect that you used to\n\n169\n00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:16.826\nhave to worry about in some\nof the earlier monitors.\n\n170\n00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:22.086\nThat the system basically had something\non the screen that stayed there and\n\n171\n00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:23.770\ndidn't move, right?\n\n172\n00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.043\nWhen you turned the computer off,\nit had that image, right?\n\n173\n00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:30.941\nBut screen savers are still very,\nvery good for\n\n174\n00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:37.227\nonce you wake the computer up,\npresenting you with a login screen, right?\n\n175\n00:08:37.227 --> 00:08:41.920\nWindows key+L inside of the Windows\nworld does a lock of the screen and\n\n176\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.630\nrequires a password to be able\nto get back into the machine.\n\n177\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.250\nAnd that's important, because when you\nwalk away from the machine, all right.\n\n178\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.290\nDan walks away from his computer,\nleaves himself logged in.\n\n179\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.538\nHe's got some banking information in\nthe session cookies of his browser.\n\n180\n00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:00.121\nI click, re-establish a connection.\n\n181\n00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.740\nNow I've got access to\nhis personal information.\n\n182\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.315\nOr maybe not even that malicious.\n\n183\n00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:10.020\nThe fact that he's just got customer\ndata that's right there on the screen.\n\n184\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.940\nSo what does he do?\n\n185\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.510\nWell, what I do,\nwhat you're usually required to do?\n\n186\n00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.970\nWell, when you walk away from your\ncomputer to a Windows key+L and\n\n187\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.550\nit locks the screen and\nrequires a password to resume, all right?\n\n188\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.620\nNow, that's a lot of talking.\n\n189\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.409\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's do a little show here.\n\n190\n00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:26.120\nI've been talking for ten minutes here and\nI haven't shown the first thing.\n\n191\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.070\nLet's go ahead and\n\n192\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.290\nyou can see on my screen right here\nI've got a login screen, right?\n\n193\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.700\nJust requiring a simple login, right?\n\n194\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.283\nThat's the first line of defense, right?\n\n195\n00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:42.120\nSo we type in our super secret password\nof one, two, three, four, all right.\n\n196\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.810\nAnd you know what, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna do something here real quick.\n\n197\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.000\nBecause I believe I can show you,\nlet me sign out and do that one more time.\n\n198\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n199\n00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.740\nthen show you that password.\n\n200\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.670\nNow, the only reason I show you this\npassword, not because it's a complex\n\n201\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:01.545\npassword but I kinda wanna just build on\nwhat Dan had shown you or had mentioned.\n\n202\n00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:03.290\nOops and, I logged in again.\n\n203\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.860\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n204\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Swing this ball too.\n\n205\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.129\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n[LAUGH] All right, so I'll do what I\n\n206\n00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:16.160\nshouldn't do and you guys are gonna help\nme with some social engineering there.\n\n207\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.680\nNotice my password, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.980\nNow, this is not a strong password.\n\n209\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.790\nThis is something that in Microsoft\ntraining and Microsoftland they\n\n210\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:27.230\nuse as just getting people's mindset\nto recognize character sets.\n\n211\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.376\nNotice that I have a capital P.\n\n212\n00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:31.180\nUppercase letters, all right?\n\n213\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.600\nNotice that I got an @ symbol.\n\n214\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.670\nSpecial characters, right?\n\n215\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.800\nAnd we've got ss that is lower case\nletters and the rd in there as well.\n\n216\n00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.860\nBut then we have a 0.\n\n217\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.650\nI have four character\nsets in this password.\n\n218\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.520\nNow is this a complex password?\n\n219\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.440\nNo, it is not and that's why you made\na good point, I really like that.\n\n220\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.821\nListen, heed the advice that,\nif I did something like this,\n\n221\n00:11:03.582 --> 00:11:04.450\nSame password.\n\n222\n00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.360\nExact same password, but\nnow it's 24 characters I believe that is,\n\n223\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.430\nI think it's an eight character password,\ntimes three, is 24.\n\n224\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.290\nRight?\n\n225\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.970\nRemember what he said,\nnot just mixing character sets, but\n\n226\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.710\nalso the length of the password.\n\n227\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.060\nSo I just wanted to make mention\nof that before we log in.\n\n228\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.000\nNow that I need to log in,\nwatch, I won't be able to.\n\n229\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.820\n&gt;&gt; Murphy's law.\n\n230\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:30.470\n&gt;&gt; Locked myself out.\n\n232\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.320\nMy job's so\nsecret even I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n233\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.510\nAll right, so we talked about some\nof the things that you can do.\n\n234\n00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.990\nNow understand we've talked about in other\nepisodes some of the Windows features, and\n\n235\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.740\nwe mentioned the local security policy.\n\n236\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.170\nSo let's take a journey,\nlet's drive through the operating system.\n\n237\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.470\nI'm gonna go ahead and right-click on\nour Windows tile if you will, icon.\n\n238\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.940\nWe're gonna go to System and Security.\n\n239\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.000\nWe're gonna scroll down the bottom.\n\n240\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.401\nAnd thank goodness it hasn't really\nchanged too much, Vista, Windows 7,\n\n241\n00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.456\n8, and 8.1, all the operating systems.\n\n242\n00:11:56.456 --> 00:11:59.029\n&gt;&gt; A few very consistent things\nabout the Windows operating system.\n\n243\n00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:00.236\n&gt;&gt; I like how you put that.\n&gt;&gt; This has been there for\n\n244\n00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:00.834\nquite some time.\n\n245\n00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:01.499\n&gt;&gt; A few.\n\n246\n00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:02.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n247\n00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:05.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very few, so yeah it is.\n\n248\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.100\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n249\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.120\nAnd remember that in here,\nyou have the local security policy.\n\n250\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.290\nSo I'll go ahead and we'll launch this up.\n\n251\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.578\nAnd I also wanna make mention to,\nbecause they might call it out.\n\n252\n00:12:18.578 --> 00:12:20.740\nIf I right-click and\nI choose the Windows Run line,\n\n253\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.420\nremember, Windows key+R would also bring\nup that traditional run line, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.240\nWe also have something known as gpedit,\nall right?\n\n255\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.470\nAnd if I open up gpedit, all right,\n\n256\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.960\nthis is the local group\npolicy editor all right.\n\n257\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.460\nRemember we talked about\nrequiring passwords?\n\n258\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.020\nWe can require a password, you can\nenforce that through group policy, right.\n\n259\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.940\nGroup policy is a series of settings that\ncan be applied to a computer configuration\n\n260\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.920\nor a user configuration.\n\n261\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.850\nAnd so it will either affect the users or\n\n262\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.080\nthe computers,\nyou know the computer itself.\n\n263\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.778\nNow typically we don't do this\nmuch on a local level, right?\n\n264\n00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:59.190\nCuz it would only apply to this machine.\n\n265\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.939\nBut first of all, if you're in a Windows\ndomain, you join this computer to\n\n266\n00:13:02.939 --> 00:13:06.273\nthe Windows domain, you're gonna\nbe required to do a password and\n\n267\n00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:09.710\nuse a password regardless\nwhether you want to or not.\n\n268\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.150\nThat's one of the things, domain-joined\ncomputers always go to a lock screen.\n\n269\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.220\nThey always boot to a lock screen.\n\n270\n00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.000\nAnd then you enter your user name and\npassword.\n\n271\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.210\nSo that's gonna be required but\n\n272\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.330\none of the good benefits, even though it's\nkind of maybe considered a pain, right.\n\n273\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.800\nI gotta always log in.\n\n274\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.661\nYou also get the convenience of a single\nsign on in an active directory domain.\n\n275\n00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:30.290\nBecause once I login as a user,\n\n276\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.368\nthen those credentials kinda follow me\nas I go through different resources or\n\n277\n00:13:34.368 --> 00:13:37.500\nI access different resources\nwithin the Windows domain.\n\n278\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.002\nSo good thing.\n\n279\n00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:42.431\nJust wanna mention real quick that group\npolicy, all of these settings that you\n\n280\n00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.462\nfind in the local security policy,\nfor instance, if I was to go to Window\n\n281\n00:13:46.462 --> 00:13:51.580\nsettings here, and is that under computer,\nthat's under computer configuration.\n\n282\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.229\nI'm on the wrong side of the river here.\n\n283\n00:13:53.229 --> 00:13:55.720\nLet me get on the right\nside of the river here.\n\n284\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.140\nPolicy is and why am I not seeing that.\n\n285\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.140\nGetting straight up templates,\nno it's not there.\n\n286\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.845\nDan, if I would pay attention here,\n\n287\n00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:10.841\nI would see it's actually right\nhere under Security Settings.\n\n288\n00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:14.120\nI'm just looking for the same kind of\nset up here and it's what dawned on me,\n\n289\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.597\nSecurity Settings,\nthat's where we need them, look.\n\n290\n00:14:16.597 --> 00:14:18.972\nSo if I look under Security Settings,\nnotice that, and\n\n291\n00:14:18.972 --> 00:14:22.650\nhere's really what I really want you\nguys to see, guys and gals out there.\n\n292\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.640\nNotice that these two lists,\nnotice how they're identical, right?\n\n293\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.050\nAnd that's the thing, understand what's\ncool about the local security policy\n\n294\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.240\nis it is a subset of\nthe Security Settings.\n\n295\n00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.860\nEssentially it is all of the Security\nSettings without all the other\n\n296\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.390\nconfigurations that you'll have.\n\n297\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.300\nSo I just wanted to mention that because\nyou never know if they're gonna ask\n\n298\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:40.970\nyou on the exam.\n\n299\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.910\nThey might say, well how can\nyou set the Security Settings?\n\n300\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.330\nIt could be a local security policy, it\ncan also be the group policy editor too so\n\n301\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.820\na couple of options there.\n\n302\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.500\nNow, in here I can do things like\nsetting password policies, right?\n\n303\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.150\nWhen we set password policies this\nis where we can enforce things like\n\n304\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.450\npassword history.\n\n305\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.730\nHow many unique passwords do you have\nto cycle through before you can reuse\n\n306\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.410\na password, all right?\n\n307\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.710\nMaximum password age, how long will\nit last before it has to be reset?\n\n308\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.460\nMinimum password age, how long\nare you required to use a password?\n\n309\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.070\nI'm not gonna let you just change you're\npassword 24 times within five minutes and\n\n310\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.270\nthen reuse a password.\n\n311\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.620\nNo, I'm gonna make you use it for\nat least a day.\n\n312\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.840\nYou set the password.\n\n313\n00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.590\nYou can change it tomorrow, no problem.\n\n314\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.410\nBut you're gonna have to do that\nevery single day for 24 days.\n\n315\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.910\nAnd I might set a password history or\na password age of 30 days.\n\n316\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.540\nSo what I would have done is\nI've given you around a six\n\n317\n00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.760\nday window there that you can\nactually make your own mind up.\n\n318\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.330\nBut there again, it helps to enforce\nsome of these other settings, right.\n\n319\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.390\nPassword length, right?\n\n320\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.663\nDan talked about two of the things\nthat he likes to combine, right.\n\n321\n00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:52.584\nPassword length, it's not enforced\non local machines until you join\n\n322\n00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:56.117\na Windows domain, and\nthe complexity requirements, right?\n\n323\n00:15:56.117 --> 00:15:59.153\nI want to say okay, you need to\nhave a ten character password and\n\n324\n00:15:59.153 --> 00:16:02.320\nyou have to use more than one\nof those character sets, right.\n\n325\n00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.900\nSo, we can set that here.\n\n326\n00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.264\nWe can also set things\nlike lockout thresholds.\n\n327\n00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:10.470\nOne of the things that Dan also\nmentioned was brute force.\n\n328\n00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.218\nI'm glad you mentioned\nthe brute force attack.\n\n329\n00:16:12.218 --> 00:16:16.270\nBrute force attack in combination with\nguessing is just going to try to rifle\n\n330\n00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.180\nthrough these passwords.\n\n331\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.610\nWhat happens if you get it wrong?\n\n332\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.740\nWell if you don't have things like\nthis set, you can just guess again.\n\n333\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.095\nJust run it through.\n\n334\n00:16:25.095 --> 00:16:25.876\n&gt;&gt; I wish it said that.\n\n335\n00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:28.410\nI wish when I got my password wrong,\nit said guess again.\n\n336\n00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.586\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nNow understand when we talk about brute\n\n337\n00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:32.810\nforce attack,\na lot of times what you have is a file\n\n338\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.600\nwithin a machine that you've run\nthrough a piece of software.\n\n339\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.510\nBut the point being is that lockout\ndurations kind of stop that\n\n340\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.530\nhammering attack that you can have.\n\n341\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.820\nRight, where I just guess, guess,\n\n342\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.620\nguess cuz that's a password attack that\nwe didn't really talk about again.\n\n343\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes it does seem like that would be\nextremely frustrating for the end user.\n\n344\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.571\nI'm locked out,\nI mistyped my password six or seven times.\n\n345\n00:16:55.571 --> 00:16:59.214\nHowever many times you give it, and\nnow I've gotta call the help desk and\n\n346\n00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:00.430\nget it unlocked.\n\n347\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.530\nAnd yes that is a frustrating thing.\n\n348\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.300\nBut when they come back from lunch, or\nthey show up to work next morning or\n\n349\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.870\nsome random day, they're gonna log in,\nand they're locked out.\n\n350\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.150\nWonder why that is.\n\n351\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.790\nLet me call the help desk and\nask them about being locked out.\n\n352\n00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.040\nWell, did you try?\n\n353\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.530\nNo, I just came in this morning,\nit was locked out.\n\n354\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.280\nThat's interesting.\n\n355\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:25.058\nLet me check the logs and see when\nthese bad password attempts occurred,\n\n356\n00:17:25.058 --> 00:17:27.719\nwell, it was 3 AM this morning.\n\n357\n00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:28.684\nWhat were you doing?\n\n358\n00:17:28.684 --> 00:17:31.071\nI was dreaming about puppy dogs and\nice cream, why?\n\n359\n00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:34.688\n[LAUGH] Because apparently someone was\ntrying to log in with your account.\n\n360\n00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:36.445\nAnd there's your problem.\n\n361\n00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:37.670\nIt's a double-edged sword.\n\n362\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.220\nIt can be frustrating for the end user,\n\n363\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.490\nand a little bit of work for\nyour help desk, but it does help\n\n364\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.950\npoints you in the fact that someone is\nattempting to do something they shouldn't.\n\n365\n00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.010\nAnd then you could start down that\nbread trail until you find it.\n\n366\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.710\n&gt;&gt; Awareness and accountability,\nabsolutely, all wrapped together.\n\n367\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.230\nSo yeah, definitely something you have.\n\n368\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.720\nYou can do things like\nagain account restrictions.\n\n369\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.423\nI'm not gonna be able to get back into my\ncomputer until I call Dan up and say- and\n\n370\n00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:04.350\nso now we have accountability.\n\n371\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.099\nLet alone an awareness that\nsomething is happening.\n\n372\n00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:10.050\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.258\nDisabling things like guest accounts, one\nof the great things is Windows disables\n\n374\n00:18:14.258 --> 00:18:16.855\nyour guest account and\nhas since the days of Vista.\n\n375\n00:18:16.855 --> 00:18:23.032\nGuest accounts can potentially\nlead into unauthorized access.\n\n376\n00:18:23.032 --> 00:18:26.600\nRight, we've already talked about\n\n377\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.592\naccount restrictions in a lockout\nafter a failed attempt.\n\n378\n00:18:31.592 --> 00:18:34.470\nRight, let me also show\nyou something else here.\n\n379\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.675\nSo if I was to do Windows key L,\nlike I just did,\n\n380\n00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:41.309\na little Windows key shortcut\nthat I just did there?\n\n381\n00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:44.460\nNotice that I have to enter my password,\nright?\n\n382\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.236\nSo lockout screens are great but you can\nalso go a little bit farther than this\n\n383\n00:18:48.236 --> 00:18:51.069\nbecause people kinda lose\nsight that even screensaver,\n\n384\n00:18:51.069 --> 00:18:53.860\nI remember when screensavers\nwere just a must, right?\n\n385\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.957\nSo a lot of times, sometimes people\ndon't even use screensavers any more but\n\n386\n00:18:57.957 --> 00:19:01.260\nIf I do something like go\ninto Personalize, right.\n\n387\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.510\nNow this is where by default,\nif you don't have it turned on.\n\n388\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.210\nAgain, changing the defaults we said,\nall right.\n\n389\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.320\nYou might not be aware of where it is.\n\n390\n00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.470\nWhat I can do here is I can\nchoose Screen saver, right?\n\n391\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.610\nI do the old legendary 3D Text right?\n\n392\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.530\nBut notice what this option says right\nhere, On resume, display login screen.\n\n393\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.660\nSo what that means is that\nwhen I go to that type of, or\n\n394\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.800\nwhen the screen saver initially kicks in.\n\n395\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.802\nWell, when I go to resume\nback into the computer,\n\n396\n00:19:33.802 --> 00:19:36.945\nwhen I go to try to get back\nin the computer it's gonna\n\n397\n00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:41.458\ndisplay the login screen requiring me and\nre-prompting for my password.\n\n398\n00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:43.826\nSo these are great thing to have,\nall right.\n\n399\n00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:49.120\nNow I will tell you there's another type\nof password that we need to be aware of.\n\n400\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.850\nAnd I tell you that your operating\nsystem setting a password is the first\n\n401\n00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.680\nline of defense, yes and no.\n\n402\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.467\nActually your first line of defense is\nusing something known as a BIOS if you\n\n403\n00:19:59.467 --> 00:20:01.950\nwill, or a UEFI-based password.\n\n404\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:07.070\nThis type of password is one that\nactually locks it at the hardware level\n\n405\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.870\nbefore the operating\nsystem even gets to run.\n\n406\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:10.660\nSo let's go ahead,\n\n407\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.560\nand let's take a second here and let's\nshow you what that password looks like.\n\n408\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.657\nYeah, Dan and I would believe that this is\nprobably a type of screen that you've seen\n\n409\n00:20:19.657 --> 00:20:23.599\nmore often than you would ever want to in\nyour life, that old BIOS screen or UEFI.\n\n410\n00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:26.858\nRemember, we're just talking\nabout the firmware, right?\n\n411\n00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:30.986\nI said that this is actually your first\nline of defense because if I go into,\n\n412\n00:20:30.986 --> 00:20:34.410\nscroll down to the BIOS setup and\nI answer in the BIOS, right?\n\n413\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.080\nYou'll notice that, well with Dell I kinda\nlike it because they had actually had\n\n414\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.280\na point click mouse in BIOS, sometimes\nall you're gonna get is the ability to\n\n415\n00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.930\nuse your arrow keys and\nif that happens that's fine.\n\n416\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.060\nJust remember, use your arrow keys, right?\n\n417\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.960\nBut notice that they have\nthis admin password, and\n\n418\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.490\nthey have what's known\nas a system password.\n\n419\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.470\nSometimes it's called a supervisor\npassword, and then just BIOS password.\n\n420\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.240\nPay attention to the scenario, which\none they're asking you, because if we\n\n421\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.830\ntalk about an admin password, this allows\nyou to enter the screen and make changes.\n\n422\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.290\nSystem password just allows\na user to really just\n\n423\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.540\nbe able to boot the operating system and\nthat's the one that we'll show here.\n\n424\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.720\nSo if you notice that it tells\nme that it's not set, right?\n\n425\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.050\nBut I could come in here and\nI can set a password right,\n\n426\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.580\nand I'm gonna do just a very basic\none just understand that you\n\n427\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.400\nprobably want to be doing this a little\nbit more secure than what I am.\n\n428\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.810\nBut I just wanna show you\nguys what it would look like.\n\n429\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.445\nAnd once I click OK on this and\nwe turn around and we choose Exit,\n\n430\n00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:37.394\nit's gonna reboot this\nmachine which is what I want.\n\n431\n00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:41.372\nBut one of the things that we're gonna\nsee is that once the machine reboots,\n\n432\n00:21:41.372 --> 00:21:44.250\nI'm gonna see that its gonna prompt me for\na password.\n\n433\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.610\nSo let's go and check that out.\n\n434\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.520\nNow we should see, at this point,\nthat there's a password lock, right?\n\n435\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.180\nThe computer hasn't even loaded\nthe operating system and in order for\n\n436\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.380\nthat to happen you're gonna\nnotice I put in the password.\n\n437\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.550\nAnd now I get to essentially,\nit's probably gonna go but either you go,\n\n438\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.740\nyou see that it's going ahead and\nis launching, and oop, you know what?\n\n439\n00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.200\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n440\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.235\n&gt;&gt; It's a very secure system.\n\n441\n00:22:09.235 --> 00:22:13.182\n&gt;&gt; It is a very secure system so again,\nyou just, you enter your password here,\n\n442\n00:22:13.182 --> 00:22:17.215\nand it allows you to boot the operating\nsystem, and that's what we wanna see.\n\n443\n00:22:17.215 --> 00:22:20.498\nNow the next thing that we kinda\nhave to look at is going to be\n\n444\n00:22:20.498 --> 00:22:23.200\na little bit more Windows-specific, right?\n\n445\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.230\nWe're gonna have to look\nat some Windows security.\n\n446\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.730\nSo let's go ahead, and we'll take\na look at my operating system, and\n\n447\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.560\nwe're talking about Windows now.\n\n448\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.180\nAnd we'll see some of the things that we\ncan use more specifically when it comes to\n\n449\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.392\nbasically, securing Windows.\n\n450\n00:22:36.392 --> 00:22:40.850\nAnd again, when it comes to\nWindows Security there is something,\n\n451\n00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.110\nsome things that we can do for instance.\n\n452\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.040\nLike if I right click on our Windows\ntile and I get into computer management,\n\n453\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.730\nkeep in mind that you have your\ncertain user groups that you can\n\n454\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.818\nuse to restrict access and just basically\nrestrict what people can do, right?\n\n455\n00:22:56.818 --> 00:23:00.950\nRemember defaults, steer away from\nthe defaults, stay away from the defaults,\n\n456\n00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.500\ndefault administrator is disabled,\nguest accounts are disabled.\n\n457\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.790\nI could have an administrative account.\n\n458\n00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.210\nThe first user that you create in\na Windows machine after you install\n\n459\n00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.850\nthe operating system,\ntechnically is an administrator.\n\n460\n00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.910\nBut they run as a standard user until they\nneed those privileges elevated right?\n\n461\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.210\nI could come in here and\nI could create a new user.\n\n462\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.770\nAnd let's just, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll create a user here for Dan.\n\n463\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.580\nRemember, notice that it's requiring\nthe user to change the password at\n\n464\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.420\nthe next logon.\n\n465\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.570\nThat's a good thing, right,\n\n466\n00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.820\nbecause then I can do something\nlike setting that generic password.\n\n467\n00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.890\nRight, and then when Dan logs in, it\nwill require him to change the password.\n\n468\n00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:41.930\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n469\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.390\ncreate this account because I also\nwanna talk about groups, right?\n\n470\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:50.146\nWe have a series of groups that are built\nin to your Windows operating system,\n\n471\n00:23:50.146 --> 00:23:50.668\nright?\n\n472\n00:23:50.668 --> 00:23:52.901\nThe administrators,\nthat should be pretty obvious, right?\n\n473\n00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:53.947\nWhatever the administrators are.\n\n474\n00:23:53.947 --> 00:23:59.039\nThey're essentially the The account that\ncan do pretty much anything they want\n\n475\n00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:03.910\nto your Windows operating systems but\nwe also have some other ones here too.\n\n476\n00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.520\nLike we have one that's really just\nhere for backwards compatibility,\n\n477\n00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.640\nback Power Users.\n\n478\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.180\nPower Users was or\nthe earlier days in Windows operating\n\n479\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.030\nsystems when we didn't have things\nlike the user account control,\n\n480\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.380\nagain notice that it tells us that they're\nincluded for backwards compasibility.\n\n481\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.330\nCompasibility, I don't know what\ncompasibility is but let's go ahead and\n\n482\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.480\ntry compatibility.\n\n483\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.360\nSo backwards compatibility, right.\n\n484\n00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:34.830\nAnd it talks about possessing\nlimited administrative privileges.\n\n485\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.720\nNow, that was good in the days\nprior to the user account control.\n\n486\n00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.870\nNow that we have the user account control,\neverybody runs as a standard user so\n\n487\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.177\nthat limits their administrative\naccess to begin with.\n\n488\n00:24:43.177 --> 00:24:46.220\nAnd it's not until you need\nthose privileges that the user\n\n489\n00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.720\naccount control triggers.\n\n490\n00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.650\nAnd if you're not an administrator,\nyou get prompted with the username and\n\n491\n00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.220\npassword to put in\nan administrative account.\n\n492\n00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.730\nOr if you are an administrator,\n\n493\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.300\nyou just have to click next to\ncontinue whatever the function is.\n\n494\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.230\nOther things that we can do.\n\n495\n00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.630\nWe can do things like for instance,\n\n496\n00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.500\nenforcing access control through\nthings like your permissions.\n\n497\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.050\nSo for instance if I'm here on the desktop\nlet's say, and I create a new file,\n\n498\n00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.880\nwill call this secret text, right?\n\n499\n00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.230\nI don't want anybody to get in here and\nread this, right?\n\n500\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.810\nWell, you also have Windows Security.\n\n501\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.050\nIf I right-click and choose Properties and\nl go to the Security tab,\n\n502\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.820\nyou will see that we have\nour permissions list, right?\n\n503\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.840\nFull control, giving me the ability\nto take ownership, see permissions,\n\n504\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.850\nchange permissions.\n\n505\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:35.270\nModify allows me to do basically,\nI can't take ownership.\n\n506\n00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.690\nI can't change permissions.\n\n507\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.860\nBut one of the things I can do\nis make changes to the document,\n\n508\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.830\nincluding doing things like deleting\nthe document if I wanted to.\n\n509\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.740\nRead &amp; Execute if it happened\nto be an application,\n\n510\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.230\nright, I could execute it\nas well as read anything.\n\n511\n00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.240\nRead the file, right.\n\n512\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.380\nAnd Read being almost the least of them,\nright.\n\n513\n00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.010\nAll I can do is view\nthe information that's in the file.\n\n514\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.625\nBut I can't make modifications to it.\n\n515\n00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:02.670\nWrite means I can actually make a change.\n\n516\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.620\nI gotta be careful using the term\nmodifications cuz I don't want you\n\n517\n00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.040\nto confuse it with Modify,\nI can alter the document.\n\n518\n00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.050\nBut what I can't do is\ndelete the document.\n\n519\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.770\nThen if I need a lot of granular control,\nwe can get into special permissions.\n\n520\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.240\nThese are called standard permissions,\nNTFS permissions.\n\n521\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.660\nAnd when they're applied to a file,\nor they can be applied to folders,\n\n522\n00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.480\nthey say that's pretty good for\nalmost any scenario that you need.\n\n523\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.830\nHowever, keep in mind that individually\nwithin each of these permissions is a more\n\n524\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.230\ngranular subset of what the privilege\nthat that permission actually gives you.\n\n525\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.120\nAnd I might say I wanna\ngive Dan full control, but\n\n526\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.160\nI don't want him to be\nable to change ownership.\n\n527\n00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.330\nCuz the full control permission\nallows him to do that.\n\n528\n00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.370\nI want him to be able to do whatever\nhe needs to do to this folder and\n\n529\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.310\nanybody's information that\nputs it in there, right.\n\n530\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.680\nHe's the administrator.\n\n531\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.950\nBut what I don't want him to be\nable to do is change the ownership.\n\n532\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.340\nSo I could do granularly in\nthe special permissions and\n\n533\n00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.760\nI can make modifications there too.\n\n534\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:06.700\nI will say, be careful or just\nunderstand that permissions propagate.\n\n535\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.100\nSo if I was to create,\nlet's say a folder on the desktop.\n\n536\n00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:18.440\nAnd we'll call this secrets, and\nI apply a permission to a folder.\n\n537\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.452\nAnd you'll notice now\nI have a sharing tab.\n\n538\n00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:22.756\nRemember, how we share folders, and\n\n539\n00:27:22.756 --> 00:27:26.428\nif I wanna share this with Dan\nover the network, I put a file,\n\n540\n00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:30.533\nthat file that I just created,\nI put in the folder and I share it out.\n\n541\n00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:33.057\nWell, I can restrict network access,\n\n542\n00:27:33.057 --> 00:27:37.339\nthe level of access that somebody\nhas to this file or this folder and\n\n543\n00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:42.250\nthe contents of it by putting essentially\nsharing permissions on it right?\n\n544\n00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:46.640\nIf I share the folder out, I also have\na set of sharing permissions too, right?\n\n545\n00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.920\nA little bit less when it comes\nto how they are but Full Control,\n\n546\n00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.850\njust like a full control NTFS permission,\nright?\n\n547\n00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.440\nChange is kinda like your Modify and\n\n548\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.670\nRead means they could see\nthe documents that are in there.\n\n549\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.751\nBut more so I also wanna mention\nthat if I, and I'll go ahead and\n\n550\n00:28:01.751 --> 00:28:06.602\nI'll just share this out basically but\nif I have a folder here, right, and\n\n551\n00:28:06.602 --> 00:28:10.770\nI decide that maybe I want to put\nRead permission on this folder.\n\n552\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.171\nSo for instance, let me see if I\ncan add Dan to the list we just\n\n553\n00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:19.503\ncreated his account and\nI don't know I can add Dan, okay.\n\n554\n00:28:19.503 --> 00:28:21.954\nNow, I've added Dan to the folder,\nnot the file.\n\n555\n00:28:21.954 --> 00:28:24.528\nBut I say, you know what?\n\n556\n00:28:24.528 --> 00:28:27.950\nI'm going to give him list folder content\nso he can see what's in the folder, and\n\n557\n00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.200\nI wanna give him a Read permission.\n\n558\n00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.050\nBut I don't wanna give him write.\n\n559\n00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.940\nAnd I say okay to that, and I apply it.\n\n560\n00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.660\nNow I want you to see something here.\n\n561\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:40.950\nIf I open the properties of this file, you\ndon't see Dan's name on the list, right?\n\n562\n00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.540\nBut watch what would happen\nwhen I take that file and\n\n563\n00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.520\ndrop it on the folder, all right?\n\n564\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.560\nNow, we go into the folder and\nI right-click and I choose Properties and\n\n565\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.460\nI choose the Security tab,\nwait a second, Dan's on the list right?\n\n566\n00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.150\nAnd if I checked Dan's permissions out,\nhe's got Read permissions.\n\n567\n00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.440\nThat's permission inheritance,\npermission propagation.\n\n568\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.470\nThat's a good way to basically\nassign all your permissions.\n\n569\n00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.410\nSo remember permission inheritance.\n\n570\n00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.473\nI also want you to see\nthis allow versus deny.\n\n571\n00:29:09.473 --> 00:29:13.576\nAll right, this is what's\nknown as an implicit allow or,\n\n572\n00:29:13.576 --> 00:29:18.470\nif you will, there's implicit and\nthere's explicit.\n\n573\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.310\nThis is what's known as\nan implicit permission.\n\n574\n00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.220\nAnd the reason I say\nthat is because I didn't\n\n575\n00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.840\nspecifically assigned Dan\nthe Read permission on this file.\n\n576\n00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.530\nAll right, I assigned it to the folder and\n\n577\n00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:38.740\nwhen I dropped his file in that folder,\nit propagated.\n\n578\n00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.040\nThat's implicit, all right.\n\n579\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.180\nNow I could explicitly and\nthis gets complicated.\n\n580\n00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.000\nYou'd never wanna do it.\n\n581\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.780\nUse the folders, right,\nthat I could come in here and\n\n582\n00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.400\nexplicitly say I wanna give\nDan the right permission.\n\n583\n00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.770\nThat's an explicit permission.\n\n584\n00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.640\nNow you also have to understand that\nnotice there is nothing in this column.\n\n585\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.810\nThere's no deny permissions, right.\n\n586\n00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.850\nWhy is that?\n\n587\n00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.330\nAll right, well guess what?\n\n588\n00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:10.060\nYou use deny very, very sparingly and\nvery careful, all right.\n\n589\n00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.560\nBecause let's say that I don't want\nDan to have the Write permission.\n\n590\n00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.910\nWell, guess what?\n\n591\n00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:21.730\nNotice there is no allow next to,\nor with Dan's name here,\n\n592\n00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.220\non the Write permission I've denied it.\n\n593\n00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.706\nI don't have to actually apply a deny.\n\n594\n00:30:28.706 --> 00:30:30.237\nThat's an implicit deny.\n\n595\n00:30:30.237 --> 00:30:34.310\nIt's not on the list guess what he\ndoesn't gain that level of access.\n\n596\n00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.200\nI could explicitly deny\nsomebody something.\n\n597\n00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.920\nBut that's where we start to\nget in trouble, all right?\n\n598\n00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.970\nCuz an explicit deny trumps\nanything that's implicit.\n\n599\n00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.920\nSo use them very sparingly because you\ncould run into permission issues, right?\n\n600\n00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.178\nIf I don't wanna give Dan Write for\nwhatever reason, right, and\n\n601\n00:30:52.178 --> 00:30:53.050\nI'm not picking on Dan.\n\n602\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.407\nBut if I don't wanna give\nDan Write permissions,\n\n603\n00:30:55.407 --> 00:30:56.929\nI just don't put it on the list.\n\n604\n00:30:56.929 --> 00:30:58.891\nIt's like a dinner reservation.\n\n605\n00:30:58.891 --> 00:31:01.306\nYou're not on the list, you don't\ngain access, you don't get a table.\n\n606\n00:31:01.306 --> 00:31:05.200\nBut it's not like being on the list and\nsaying you're barred from this restaurant.\n\n607\n00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, blacklisted.\n\n608\n00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.900\nYou got it, right?\n\n609\n00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Explicit\n\n610\n00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.220\nversus implicit definitely know that.\n\n611\n00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.090\nAll right, couple of other things\nthat we can do as we wrap up here.\n\n612\n00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.090\nI want you to know that you\ncan also do things like or\n\n613\n00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:20.110\ninstance encrypt entire drives by\ngoing into Control Panel &gt; System and\n\n614\n00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.250\nSecurity and there's something known\nas BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n615\n00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:29.470\nBitLocker Drive Encryption is a hard drive\nencryption technology that allows you to\n\n616\n00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.560\nfully encrypt the entire drive.\n\n617\n00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.717\nIt works with something known as\na trusted platform module, a TPM chip,\n\n618\n00:31:34.717 --> 00:31:36.291\nit's a cryptographic processor.\n\n619\n00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:38.137\nI love the terms that\nthey throw out there.\n\n620\n00:31:38.137 --> 00:31:41.151\nIt's a processor that holds\nsecurity information, and\n\n621\n00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:44.602\nit's tied to the motherboard of\nthe system that this hard drive,\n\n622\n00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:46.944\nthis operating system, was installed on.\n\n623\n00:31:46.944 --> 00:31:49.538\nIf I pull that drive out, and\nput it into another one, and\n\n624\n00:31:49.538 --> 00:31:51.552\nBitLocker's been turned on, guess what?\n\n625\n00:31:51.552 --> 00:31:53.038\nIt locks itself down.\n\n626\n00:31:53.038 --> 00:31:54.631\nAnd it goes into recovery mode.\n\n627\n00:31:54.631 --> 00:31:58.080\nSo it helps with things\nlike offline file attacks.\n\n628\n00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.200\nNow there's other things that you have\ninside on your files, if you will.\n\n629\n00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.200\nAnd that's something known as attributes.\n\n630\n00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.170\nI was gonna mention that in\nthe permissions, but I kinda forgot it.\n\n631\n00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.193\nLet me go ahead and\nthrow that in here, too,\n\n632\n00:32:11.193 --> 00:32:13.012\ncuz we do have to cover that real quick.\n\n633\n00:32:13.012 --> 00:32:16.807\nAll right, you have what are known\nas attributes on files, right?\n\n634\n00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:19.945\nAnd they tell the Windows subsystem what\ndo I do with this file when I find it,\n\n635\n00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:20.446\nall right?\n\n636\n00:32:20.446 --> 00:32:22.540\nWe'll mark it Read-only.\n\n637\n00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.570\nBe careful with this one, exam alert.\n\n638\n00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.078\nIf you mark a file with an attribute of\nRead-only and I give Dan full control\n\n639\n00:32:28.078 --> 00:32:31.251\nbecause I want him to have control\nof it as a systems administrator,\n\n640\n00:32:31.251 --> 00:32:32.156\ndoesn't matter.\n\n641\n00:32:32.156 --> 00:32:34.967\nHe's not gonna be able to make\nmodifications cuz the attribute will\n\n642\n00:32:34.967 --> 00:32:36.570\ntrump the permission.\n\n643\n00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:43.443\nHidden, that hides files, hides folders\nfrom the graphical user interface.\n\n644\n00:32:43.443 --> 00:32:46.780\nYou also have system files and folders.\n\n645\n00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.260\nThose are typically hidden because they\ndon't want you to make modifications to\n\n646\n00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.400\nthem, right?\n\n647\n00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.875\nIt's Windows' way of protecting itself,\nif you will, protecting itself from us,\n\n648\n00:32:55.875 --> 00:32:56.420\nright?\n\n649\n00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.590\nWe had a user in our chatroom that said,\nwhat was that about the computers doing?\n\n650\n00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.496\n&gt;&gt; They only do what we tell them to do,\nright?\n\n651\n00:33:03.496 --> 00:33:05.140\nThey have a bad habit of that.\n\n652\n00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.350\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct.\n\n653\n00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.110\nAnd that's why some of these things\nare hidden because they protect them.\n\n654\n00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.298\nThey protect us from ourselves, all right?\n\n655\n00:33:11.298 --> 00:33:15.787\nNow one of those attributes as well that\ncan go into security is what's known as\n\n656\n00:33:15.787 --> 00:33:18.780\nthe advanced, or\nit's an advanced attribute, but\n\n657\n00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.000\nwhat's known as the encryption attribute.\n\n658\n00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.800\nEncrypt contents to secure data.\n\n659\n00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.705\nThis essentially turns on NTFS's subsystem\ncalled EFS, Encrypted File System, and\n\n660\n00:33:28.705 --> 00:33:30.327\nnow scrambles the content.\n\n661\n00:33:30.327 --> 00:33:35.390\nSo only the owner of the file can\nactually view it and what's going on.\n\n662\n00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.010\nOne last thing that I wanted to mention,\nDan, and\n\n663\n00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:43.580\nI know we're at the end of this journey,\nis BitLocker To Go.\n\n664\n00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.029\nWe've been mentioning things\nin security like encryption or\n\n665\n00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:51.555\nexcuse me, using removable drives and\nstuff like that, like USB thumb drives.\n\n666\n00:33:51.555 --> 00:33:53.790\nAnd they're an avenue of attack.\n\n667\n00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.000\nBut they're also an avenue of\ngetting confidential information in\n\n668\n00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.852\nthe wrong hands.\n\n669\n00:33:57.852 --> 00:34:01.729\nSo what they did is they allowed you the\nability not only to use BitLocker on your\n\n670\n00:34:01.729 --> 00:34:04.551\nfixed data drives and\nyour operating system drives, but\n\n671\n00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:07.640\nalso removable drives that\nyou plug into the machine.\n\n672\n00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.370\nI can actually encrypt\nthat removable drive so\n\n673\n00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:14.931\nthat if it does fall into unauthorized\nhands, if somebody goes to plug it in.\n\n674\n00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:18.250\nIf they don't have the BitLocker password,\nthey're not gonna be able to get in there\n\n675\n00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.617\nand read the information because\nit has strong encryption.\n\n676\n00:34:20.617 --> 00:34:25.603\nSo that is also something that\nyou want to keep in mind.\n\n677\n00:34:25.603 --> 00:34:27.440\nThe other thing that I'll tell you too.\n\n678\n00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.492\nIf you need more information on some\nof the Windows security things,\n\n679\n00:34:30.492 --> 00:34:32.291\ndefinitely check out our full library.\n\n680\n00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:36.250\nRemember, there is something,\nsome things are implied here.\n\n681\n00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.210\nLast thing I wanna mention is NTFS and\nshare permissions.\n\n682\n00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.570\nThat's one that I didn't mention.\n\n683\n00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.162\nWhen you set a share permission,\nand you set an NTFS permission,\n\n684\n00:34:46.162 --> 00:34:48.277\nNTFS permissions always apply.\n\n685\n00:34:48.277 --> 00:34:52.170\nIf I'm sitting at the computer locally,\nNTFS permissions apply.\n\n686\n00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.190\nIf I connect over the network\nthrough the share and\n\n687\n00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.910\nview that file, NTFS permissions apply.\n\n688\n00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.970\nBut now we also have share permissions\nbecause you're accessing it\n\n689\n00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.310\nover the network.\n\n690\n00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:07.850\nWhen both of those permission sets\nare combined, NTFS and share permissions,\n\n691\n00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.534\nthe most restrictive permission becomes\nwhat's known as the effective permission,\n\n692\n00:35:11.534 --> 00:35:13.380\nyour effective level of access.\n\n693\n00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:19.310\nSo if I set share read, and I set full\ncontrol NTFS, and somebody connects\n\n694\n00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.560\nto that share over the shared network, you\nmight expect them to have full control.\n\n695\n00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.491\nBut the most restrictive in\nthis case is gonna win out.\n\n696\n00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:26.898\nSo it's gonna be read.\n\n697\n00:35:26.898 --> 00:35:31.250\nIf I flip flop them and I give full\ncontrol share and I give read NTFS and\n\n698\n00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:35.529\nwe connect over the network,\nyou might say, well, wait a second,\n\n699\n00:35:35.529 --> 00:35:38.107\nI gave full control share permissions.\n\n700\n00:35:38.107 --> 00:35:39.547\nNTFS is read, guess what?\n\n701\n00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:41.904\nI don't care what side\nof the tracks it's on.\n\n702\n00:35:41.904 --> 00:35:45.335\nWhatever they give you on the exam,\nthe most restrictive is gonna win out.\n\n703\n00:35:45.335 --> 00:35:48.909\nThose are some of the things that you can\ndo to not only secure your workstations\n\n704\n00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:50.982\nbut also a little bit\nmore Windows specific.\n\n705\n00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.214\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n706\n00:35:52.214 --> 00:35:55.341\nyou can also know how to secure\nyour Windows operating system.\n\n707\n00:35:55.341 --> 00:35:58.481\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, a lot of have\ngreat generic security principles for\n\n708\n00:35:58.481 --> 00:36:01.690\nus to take in and work with and\nunderstand so that we can be more secure.\n\n709\n00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.327\nAs well as some very Windows-centric\nsecurity mechanisms that are built into\n\n710\n00:36:05.327 --> 00:36:06.826\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n711\n00:36:06.826 --> 00:36:08.018\nKnow all about those.\n\n712\n00:36:08.018 --> 00:36:11.031\nThat's really good for\nyou apart from the A+ exam.\n\n713\n00:36:11.031 --> 00:36:13.262\nThat being said, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n714\n00:36:13.262 --> 00:36:14.622\nWes, thanks for dropping by.\n\n715\n00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:16.442\nAnd thank our audience out there for\nwatching.\n\n716\n00:36:16.442 --> 00:36:17.548\nWe do appreciate you.\n\n717\n00:36:17.548 --> 00:36:20.276\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n718\n00:36:20.276

00:00:08.333\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:12.109\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.623\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:16.320\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.910\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.400\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore in our A Plus Accelerated Series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.560\nJoining us back yet again the man,\nthe myth, the legend,\n\n10\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.260\nyou know him as Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.640\nWes welcome back how is it going?\n\n12\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.210\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great and it's great\nto be in this episode today because\n\n13\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.075\nwe are gonna be talking about one of my\nfavorite words and that is destruction.\n\n14\n00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n15\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.390\nyou ask anybody around here and I could\ntell you, when it comes to, I'll help you\n\n16\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.953\nfix your computer as long as it wasn't me\nthat, maybe broke it in the first place.\n\n17\n00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:44.956\n&gt;&gt; I could break an anvil,\n\n18\n00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.812\nit's crazy [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be talking about more\n\n19\n00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:49.717\nspecifically when it\ncomes to the destruction,\n\n20\n00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:52.735\nit's not necessarily the computers\nalthough when I guess in some case you can\n\n21\n00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:54.419\nconsider it you might\neven have to do that.\n\n22\n00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:56.770\nBut, we're gonna talk\nabout data destruction.\n\n23\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.548\nAnd, when it comes to data destruction\nit is important to understand that this\n\n24\n00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:02.507\nis a security implementation, right.\n\n25\n00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:06.287\nAs we move through our security,\none of the things that we have to,\n\n26\n00:01:06.287 --> 00:01:09.934\njust take into consideration is\nthat well if you think about it,\n\n27\n00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:12.110\nwhat do we use computers for, right?\n\n28\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.080\nAnd it doesn't matter if you use\ncomputers to, in your business for\n\n29\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.050\nthings as simple as graphics design,\nit doesn't matter if you use\n\n30\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.570\nyour computers for spreadsheets,\nright, it's all about information.\n\n31\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.580\nThat's essentially what we\nuse our computers for, and\n\n32\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.660\nsome of that information\nhas to remain private.\n\n33\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.045\nSome of that information, you don't\nwant it ending up in unauthorized hands.\n\n34\n00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.280\nYou say now wait a second,\nif you're into graphics design.\n\n35\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.310\nWhy would you want that to get\ninto other people's hands?\n\n36\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.330\nWell, I want you to take a company\nlike Pixar or DreamWorks, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.333\nThey're working on that next great movie,\nall right?\n\n38\n00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.210\nThe competition is out there.\n\n39\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.300\nWell, they certainly wouldn't want\na project that they're working on, to get\n\n40\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.710\ninto the hands of another company because\nwell they can maybe take it, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.156\nAnd maybe cost them lots of money.\n\n42\n00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:07.226\nSo it doesn't matter if it's something\nlike that all the way down to something\n\n43\n00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.875\nthat you know, shouldn't be enough\nunauthorized hands, like PII.\n\n44\n00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:12.170\nThat's a big one that we talk about.\n\n45\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.290\nEspecially, I have to worry\nabout that in data destruction.\n\n46\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.600\nPersonally Identifiable Information,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.148\nI don't want somebody to have access\nto my Social Security number.\n\n48\n00:02:20.148 --> 00:02:26.287\nI don't want somebody to have access to,\nall of my personal information.\n\n49\n00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:26.880\n&gt;&gt; You don't?\n\n50\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.035\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nwell I guess I don't want anybody-\n\n51\n00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:29.379\n&gt;&gt; I'll take the website down.\n\n52\n00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.171\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n53\n00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:32.419\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, I don't want anybody to\n\n54\n00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.668\nhave access to the internet, right?\n\n55\n00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:35.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know,\n\n56\n00:02:35.262 --> 00:02:38.982\nthere are some things that we have to\nkeep in mind that on those systems,\n\n57\n00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:43.084\non the systems essentially that we use,\nthat we have to keep that data secure.\n\n58\n00:02:43.084 --> 00:02:47.350\nNow, we can secure information\nthrough encryption techniques, right?\n\n59\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.960\nWe can make sure that the data that\nis stored is secure in the fact that\n\n60\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.900\nwe run electronic algorithms or\nit scrambles the information.\n\n61\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.460\nBut you also have to understand,\nyou don't just have digital information.\n\n62\n00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.400\nYou also have analog information.\n\n63\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.680\nNow we are stepping back and\nwe're saying, wait a second, analog?\n\n64\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.920\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n65\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.229\nI want you to think about the data\nthat's on pieces of paper, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:13.173\nYou'll probably have a printer at your\noffice, and if not you know of somebody\n\n67\n00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:16.355\nthat does have a printer at your office,\nor at another office.\n\n68\n00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:20.145\nAnd one of the things you've to keep in\nmind, sometimes people will print things,\n\n69\n00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:21.945\nand will leave at the printer, right?\n\n70\n00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:25.682\nI don't know how many times that in\na business that I worked for before,\n\n71\n00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:29.317\nthat somebody would go for a loan or\nsomebody would, not even a loan.\n\n72\n00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:34.172\nThey would go and try to become part of\nthe service that was being offered, and\n\n73\n00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:39.340\nsomebody would leave printed\ndocuments right there at the printer.\n\n74\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.440\nOr, they would move them to the side\nbecause that wasn't the document\n\n75\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.000\nthey printed and\nnow we've got information that\n\n76\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.870\ncould potentially have\nsensitive information on it.\n\n77\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.630\nNow, that's where clean desk policies and\npolicy retention or\n\n78\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.030\ndata retention policies excuse me,\n\n79\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.279\ncome into play but now what happens\nonce we no longer need that information?\n\n80\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.680\nThat's the state that we're talking about,\nall right?\n\n81\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.540\nBecause it's easy to secure your\ninformation through encryption while\n\n82\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.180\nit's on your hard drives,\nwhile it's within your systems, but\n\n83\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.650\nwhat happens when those hard\ndrives are no longer needed?\n\n84\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.340\nWhat happens when those documents\nhave served their purpose?\n\n85\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.899\nWhat happens when you have optical\ndisks that have information on it,\n\n86\n00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.054\nwhen you have USB thumb drives,\nthat have information on it?\n\n87\n00:04:21.054 --> 00:04:22.992\nWhen I have things like, I don't know,\n\n88\n00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:25.810\nin fact I got one here when\nas I fumbled around for it.\n\n89\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.360\nWhen I've got external drives,\nthat could potentially\n\n90\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.090\nhave information on it that I don't\nwant to just end up in anybody's hand.\n\n91\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.370\nThat's why data destruction is important.\n\n92\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.650\nAll right, and you also have to understand\nthat there are guidelines out there\n\n93\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.650\nthat we have to follow.\n\n94\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.540\nNow, these guidelines\nthat I'm gonna mention,\n\n95\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.410\nI don't want you guys worried\nabout them on the exam.\n\n96\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.080\nBut, understand that there are industry\nwide guidelines and standards.\n\n97\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.980\nThat companies will adhere to.\n\n98\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.512\nBecause if they don't, the liability for\nsome of that information\n\n99\n00:04:56.512 --> 00:05:01.375\nend up in unauthorized hands\ncould put him out of business.\n\n100\n00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:05.961\nAnd that's why it's very important even\nif the A plus level to understand,\n\n101\n00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:10.130\nthat certain types of data we have\nto make sure, that we sanitize it.\n\n102\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.250\nThat is one of the common terms.\n\n103\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.380\nSanitize, is what you are doing\nwhen you mean, sanitizing.\n\n104\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.261\nWell, think about\nsanitization as cleaning.\n\n105\n00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.140\nAll right, well,\nyou clean the storage media, all right.\n\n106\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.090\nAnd there is a couple of different things\nthat I wanna mention about cleaning\n\n107\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.800\nyour media, cleaning the media, all right.\n\n108\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.260\nIf you are going, if you gonna sanitize\ndata, all right, you have to keep in mind,\n\n109\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.450\nare you gonna reuse the device,\nthe storage medium, all right?\n\n110\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.094\nBecause what method you use,\n\n111\n00:05:35.094 --> 00:05:38.922\nwill dictate whether you can even\nreuse the media at all, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:42.380\nNow, let's say I got a hard drive on it,\nlet's say it's an old parallel ATA drive,\n\n113\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.010\nand for whatever reason I've\nhad it ten years in the closet.\n\n114\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.170\nI know I'm probably not\ngonna use that anymore, so\n\n115\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.410\nI'm not repurpose or recycle it.\n\n116\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.150\nI could probably destroy that drive,\nright.\n\n117\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.450\nPhysically destroy it, right.\n\n118\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.282\nThe drill and the hammer, right?\n\n119\n00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:57.940\nIncineration being one\nof those as well,right.\n\n120\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.248\nWe just completely turn it\ninto a puddle of ooze, right.\n\n121\n00:06:01.248 --> 00:06:03.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nIt's usually lot of fun?\n\n122\n00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:04.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man especially yeah,\n\n123\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.170\nyou hit it with a acetylene torch.\n\n124\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.110\nI think it's what it is.\n\n125\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.297\n&gt;&gt; It's magic\n&gt;&gt; It's just bubbles right?\n\n126\n00:06:09.297 --> 00:06:13.049\nI don't expect to use that drive to\nbegin with ever again, all right.\n\n127\n00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:17.090\nBut companies when they\nspend lots on computers.\n\n128\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.590\nWhen they get deployments of computers,\nmachine if you will,\n\n129\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.800\nthat there's a thousand of them.\n\n130\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.624\nAll right, and they're only two years old.\n\n131\n00:06:25.624 --> 00:06:29.920\nWell, to some companies, they wanna get\nas much lifespan as they can off those.\n\n132\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.820\nAnd if those drivers are fine, they\nmight repurpose them, well, guess what?\n\n133\n00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.760\nThat Dan and I pull out the acetylene\ntorch, and we pull out the drill and\n\n134\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.950\nthe hammer, guess what's not gonna happen.\n\n135\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.900\nYou're not gonna be reusing those drives,\nright.\n\n136\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.540\nSo there's different methods and\n\n137\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.790\nyou have to understand, what are we going\nto do with the storage media, right?\n\n138\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.030\nSo let's talk about\nthe different sanitization\n\n139\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.290\ntype methods that you have, right?\n\n140\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.610\nIf you're gonna recycle or\nrepurpose a drive you have formatting.\n\n141\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.350\nAlright now, formatting comes in a couple\nof different types now, all right?\n\n142\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.930\nYou have high level formatting and\nlow level formatting.\n\n143\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.820\nHigh level formatting sometimes\ncalled standard formatting,\n\n144\n00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.210\nthat's a vendor neutral type term.\n\n145\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.850\nIf I was to give this hard\ndrive to Dan right now,\n\n146\n00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:19.090\nI don't know if its in\nMac's OS journal file system.\n\n147\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.730\nBut if I said, you know Dan,\ni don't have any information on this, and\n\n148\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.970\nI think we gonna need to move\nthis between Windows, and\n\n149\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.900\nwe gonna need to move it between Mac,\nright.\n\n150\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.884\nI can hand it to him,\nand say, you know what,\n\n151\n00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.043\nI need you to format that with xpath,\nall right.\n\n152\n00:07:34.043 --> 00:07:37.645\nI need to take a file drive utility and\nI need you to format and\n\n153\n00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:39.728\nput the file system on it.\n\n154\n00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:43.930\nWell that formatting is a high level\nformatting that's a standard format\n\n155\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.757\nis what you're operating system do, it's\na piece of software do to the hard drive.\n\n156\n00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:52.995\nUnderstand that, especially with\nthings like magnetic media,\n\n157\n00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:58.167\nwith magnetic media that data that was\nthere before is still there, all right?\n\n158\n00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:01.635\nYou have another type of formatting that\nusually happens from the manufacturers\n\n159\n00:08:01.635 --> 00:08:05.409\nthemselves and that's before you even see\nthe drives, that's low level formatting,\n\n160\n00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:06.030\nall right.\n\n161\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.747\nSo low level formatting is a lot of times\ndone by the manufacturer, standard or high\n\n162\n00:08:09.747 --> 00:08:13.910\nlevel formatting is what we do when we sit\nthere and we put the device, the storage\n\n163\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.570\ndevice in our computers and we run some\nkind of program across it, all right.\n\n164\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.740\nNow you also have a high\nlevel format that's very,\n\n165\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.440\nvery effective in almost giving you,\n\n166\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.510\nkinda like the low level in the fact that\nit's called an overwriter, all right.\n\n167\n00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.160\nNow overwriting's a little bit\ndifferent because while you\n\n168\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.610\nare formatting the drive, you're kinda\nmasking what's underneath, right.\n\n169\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.030\nSo for instance let's say that I took,\nI don't know,\n\n170\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.162\nlet's say that I wrote something on\na chalkboard or on a whiteboard,\n\n171\n00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:49.420\nright, and then I turned around and\nI wrote over it, and then I wrote over it\n\n172\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.960\nsomething completely different,\nand I kept doing that a few times.\n\n173\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.150\nWell have I really erased anything?\n\n174\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.500\nAnd the answer is no,\nI really haven't erased anything.\n\n175\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.070\n&gt;&gt; You've just obscured\nthe data that's actually there.\n\n176\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.280\nWe did this as kids in school,\nyou write something to your friends and\n\n177\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.860\nthen once they've read it they do\nlines across, then lines this way, and\n\n178\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.160\nthen lines that way, and lines this way.\n\n179\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.080\nAnd you scribble all over it and\nyou just can't read what's underneath it,\n\n180\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.560\nthe message is still there you\njust can't see it anymore.\n\n181\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and then you would have\nthe trick that if you're good enough,\n\n182\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.520\nyou would just put another piece of\npaper over there and like the etching,\n\n183\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.265\nyou would erase.\n\n184\n00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:22.810\nYou'd just sit there and take a piece\nof charcoal across the top and\n\n185\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.120\nyou could see exactly what was on that\noriginal writing because it would leave\n\n186\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.818\nthe indention of the pencil or\nthe pen in the piece of paper.\n\n187\n00:09:29.818 --> 00:09:34.549\nSo you gotta understand that there's\na certain point in doing overwriting where\n\n188\n00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:38.515\nit becomes infeasible,\nimpractical I guess, never impossible,\n\n189\n00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:43.333\nyou never say impossible in computing or\nsecurity, to recover the data, right.\n\n190\n00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.643\nThey have standards out there,\nthe Department of the Defense,\n\n191\n00:09:45.643 --> 00:09:47.890\nremember I told you that there's\nsome guidelines out there.\n\n192\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.641\nNIST is one,\nNational Institute of Standards and\n\n193\n00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:55.551\nTechnology I believe, they've got like an\n800 document out there, you can find it,\n\n194\n00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:59.674\ndo a Google search out there, you don't\nhave to worry about it on the exam,\n\n195\n00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:03.830\nthat give you the guideline for\nsecurely sanitizing your storage medium.\n\n196\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.630\nThe DOD, Department of Defense,\nthey have one.\n\n197\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.000\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\n\n198\n00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.778\nshow you I've got a piece of software\nright here that does this, all right.\n\n199\n00:10:13.778 --> 00:10:17.140\nAnd I apologize ahead of time cuz\nthere's kinda like mats here, this is\n\n200\n00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.450\nwhat they consider a Linux live CD, it's a\npreinstallation environment so there isn't\n\n201\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:26.930\nany video adapter or video driver in here\nand that's why you can see a mat there.\n\n202\n00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.480\nBut if I wanna learn what\nI can do in here, for\n\n203\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.475\ninstance I can do an F3 and you'll notice\nthat there's a few of these options,\n\n204\n00:10:36.475 --> 00:10:39.920\nright, wipe all disks with something\nknown as the DOD standard.\n\n205\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.800\nNow I don't want you guys on the A+ exam,\nnow if you're going on to Security+\n\n206\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.910\nlater down the road,\nyou're going to high level or some more\n\n207\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.920\nadvanced security certifications, you\nmight need to know something like this.\n\n208\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.560\nBut this is a standard that the DOD puts\nout that says hey, if you make these three\n\n209\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.690\npasses across the media then it\nbecomes impractibal, or impractical,\n\n210\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.920\nI will make my own contributions in\nthe English language, impractical for\n\n211\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.228\neven a computer laboratory to be able\nto recover that information, right.\n\n212\n00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:12.830\nSo that's overwriting, and again there\nare standards out there to follow,\n\n213\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.766\nhow many passes,\nthe more passes you make the more obscure,\n\n214\n00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:20.700\nto use that word that you threw out there,\nthe more it obscures that information so\n\n215\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.670\nit's not really feasible\nto recover the data, right.\n\n216\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.060\nOne of the great things about this is this\ndoes what's known as an offline overwrite,\n\n217\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:33.090\nall right, versus an online overwrite\nwhere you're in the operating system and\n\n218\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.620\nlet's say you have another hard drive, and\n\n219\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.020\nyou might hear it called drive scrubbing,\nright.\n\n220\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.640\nYou're scrubbing the drive, right, again\nsanitization, they think about some of\n\n221\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.830\nthese jargon terms, so\nthat's something that you can use as well.\n\n222\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.612\nIf you're doing other forms of\nhigh level formatting you can\n\n223\n00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:50.329\nuse things like format.exe in the command\nprompt, that will allow you to do it.\n\n224\n00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:54.263\nDisk management, whether you're talking\nabout the GUI base inside of Windows or\n\n225\n00:11:54.263 --> 00:11:56.410\ndiskpart if you're in the command line.\n\n226\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.298\nfdisk I believe still exists\ninside of Linux, right, so\n\n227\n00:11:59.298 --> 00:12:01.354\nif you're in a Linux operating system.\n\n228\n00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:05.269\nIf you happen to be, if you're needing\nto do high level formatting inside of\n\n229\n00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:08.815\nyour Mac operating system you could\nalways, in fact let me show you,\n\n230\n00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:11.620\nyou can use things like the disk utility.\n\n231\n00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.530\nDisk utility allows you to do, I'm not\ngonna do this to the operating system\n\n232\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.420\ndrive but this would allow me to do\nthings like erase the drive here too.\n\n233\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.782\nKeep in mind that that's the high level\nformat, it's not the low level format but\n\n234\n00:12:24.782 --> 00:12:29.056\nit does give you at least the ability\nto recycle the information or\n\n235\n00:12:29.056 --> 00:12:32.708\nrecycle the drives to repurpose them and\nturn around and\n\n236\n00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:35.219\nput them back into action if you need.\n\n237\n00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:38.472\nNow what if you don't need\nto reuse the device, or\n\n238\n00:12:38.472 --> 00:12:41.423\nmaybe it's impossible to reuse the device.\n\n239\n00:12:41.423 --> 00:12:44.424\nI want you to think about this,\nright, if I have a piece of paper and\n\n240\n00:12:44.424 --> 00:12:47.911\nit's got printed text on it chances\nare I'm not gonna be reusing it, right,\n\n241\n00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:49.760\nmaybe for notes or something like that.\n\n242\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.130\nBut with personal information,\nhow do we get rid of stuff like that?\n\n243\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.670\nWell that's where things like file\nshredders come into play, right,\n\n244\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.530\nthat's one of the things that\nthey call out and they say hey,\n\n245\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.360\nyou could do shredding, all right.\n\n246\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.560\nSo let me give you an example here,\n\n247\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.708\njust doing a little Google search you'll\nsee that there's home ones, right,\n\n248\n00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:08.040\naverage office ones, and\nits really with a cross cut, how\n\n249\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.530\nmany cuts it does, and\nhow many you can do at one time.\n\n250\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.180\nDon't think for one minute though that you\ncan't do this on an industrial level, and\n\n251\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.520\nlet's see if they have, yeah there we go,\nthis young lady is next to one.\n\n252\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.155\n&gt;&gt; Yes she is.\n\n253\n00:13:24.155 --> 00:13:27.520\n&gt;&gt; $20,000, right, so you could buy a\npaper shredder or you could buy a new car,\n\n254\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.450\nall right, so some of these, again\nkeep in mind that they do bulk, right.\n\n255\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.390\nOkay, so if I got one of these five\nsheet microcut shredders that is perfect\n\n256\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.100\nif I'm just talking about the bills that\nare coming into my home environment.\n\n257\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:48.410\nBut if I've got a closet with 10,000\npieces of paper, boxes upon boxes\n\n258\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:53.913\nof paper, you're gonna have a hard time\ndoing it with these five sheet microcuts.\n\n259\n00:13:53.913 --> 00:13:59.550\nUnless you're then maybe you don't mind,\nyou start today and you'll never be done.\n\n260\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.060\nAll right, so shredding is\nsomething that you can do too.\n\n261\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.443\nNow the other thing that you have are what\nare known as electromagnetic degaussing\n\n262\n00:14:07.443 --> 00:14:08.462\ndevices, right.\n\n263\n00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:12.131\nThat's good for physical media,\nwhen we talk about shredding and stuff,\n\n264\n00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:14.633\nor paper and stuff,\nit even works on credit cards,\n\n265\n00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:18.146\nand even optical disks they have that\nthey'll allow you to shred them.\n\n266\n00:14:18.146 --> 00:14:22.838\nBut with electromagnetic media like hard\ndrives you have what are known as these\n\n267\n00:14:22.838 --> 00:14:27.111\ndegaussers, right, and they use high\npowered magnets in order to erase\n\n268\n00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:31.664\nthe media, and you can see they aren't\ncheap, they're very expensive, so\n\n269\n00:14:31.664 --> 00:14:35.265\nyour company might have a had\ntime justifying the cost here.\n\n270\n00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:39.383\nThere's also incineration like we've kind\nof already mentioned with things like\n\n271\n00:14:39.383 --> 00:14:42.620\nthermite, things like acetylene\ntorches if you will too.\n\n272\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.242\nBut if your company can't afford\nto buy one of these almost,\n\n273\n00:14:47.242 --> 00:14:49.780\nwell $16,000 machines,\n\n274\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.232\nyou can go to companies online and\nyou can pay them to do it.\n\n275\n00:14:54.232 --> 00:14:57.294\nThey'll do hard drive\ndestruction as you can see here,\n\n276\n00:14:57.294 --> 00:15:00.162\npaper shredding,\nelectronic recycling, right,\n\n277\n00:15:00.162 --> 00:15:03.902\nthey have all different kinds of\nservices here that they can do too.\n\n278\n00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:06.550\n&gt;&gt; I've seen these things,\nthey pull up with a big truck and\n\n279\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.030\nthen you hear it whirring and grinding in\nthere and you're like what is going on?\n\n280\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.420\nAnd you realize they're a data destruction\ncompany, they're loading hard drives into\n\n281\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.610\na big shredder that's just turning them\ninto metal confetti, very cool stuff.\n\n282\n00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you ever get a chance to look\nat it and you wanna look a little bit more\n\n283\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.850\ngo to YouTube out there and look for\none of these conveyor belts.\n\n284\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.111\nAnd the trucks are impressive, that\nthey've made a way to make these mobile.\n\n285\n00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:34.401\nSome of the ones I've seen is where they\nhave conveyor belts and computers and\n\n286\n00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:37.239\nhard drives are dropping\ndown into these things and\n\n287\n00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:41.529\nthey're chewing them up like butter and\nthe only thing that's left are these\n\n288\n00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:44.896\nlittle postage stamp size\npieces of metal devices, right.\n\n289\n00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:49.871\nAnd what they offer really is contingent\non, a lot of times how much money you\n\n290\n00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:53.553\nhave But if you have noticed\nit's not just hard drives.\n\n291\n00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:57.869\nWe have things like desktops and laptops,\nmonitors, computer, cell phones.\n\n292\n00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:00.959\nCell phones that's a big one,\nyou have internal storage on these\n\n293\n00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.712\ndevices let alone the external\nstorage that are on them and\n\n294\n00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:06.640\nsometimes people won't take\nthose external cards out.\n\n295\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.950\nThey swap out the phone or guess what?\n\n296\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.120\nYou got that external card in there or\nin the internal memory on the device too,\n\n297\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.870\nthe internal storage,\nit's got leftover information too.\n\n298\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:22.302\nSo, you'll see that it's\nnot just hard drives.\n\n299\n00:16:22.302 --> 00:16:26.308\nYou also have things that you need to\nconsider too, this is one of the big ones,\n\n300\n00:16:26.308 --> 00:16:28.690\nand this is one of\nthe reasons I like this site.\n\n301\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.047\nBecause they tell you right here,\ncertification or\n\n302\n00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:34.220\ncertificate [INAUDIBLE] certificate\ncertification of destruction.\n\n303\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.620\nI can almost think of a Megadeath\nsong now going on in my head.\n\n304\n00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.920\nSo the Certificate of Destruction says\nhey, we're licensed, we're bonded,\n\n305\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.510\nwe're insured.\n\n306\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.910\nYou just paid us for a service.\n\n307\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.703\nAnd like Dan said, we brought your truck\nour truck out to your site we took your\n\n308\n00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:54.710\ninformation, we took your\nthe papers that you have.\n\n309\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.050\nIn fact, we probably left you with\na trash can with a locked bin so\n\n310\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.600\nyou can put the papers in so\nwe'll just pull them out.\n\n311\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.360\nWe're gonna take all of this information,\nwe're gonna take all of these component,\n\n312\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.170\nwe're gonna shred them.\n\n313\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:11.590\nAnd we are going to be held liable if\nthat data ends up in unauthorized hands.\n\n314\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:14.810\nNow that is a great peace of mind to have.\n\n315\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.788\nSo if your company cannot afford\n$20,000 on a paper shredder\n\n316\n00:17:20.788 --> 00:17:26.393\n$15,000 on an electromagnetic degausser,\nthen well, guess what?\n\n317\n00:17:26.393 --> 00:17:28.960\nYou can use a service like this.\n\n318\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.200\nAnd again there are plenty different ones.\n\n319\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.880\nIn fact let me show you another one here.\n\n320\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.670\nThey have certifications and compliance.\n\n321\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.130\nThat's why I keep saying\nit's certifications.\n\n322\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.021\nCuz you will see that\nthese different machines,\n\n323\n00:17:40.021 --> 00:17:44.620\nagain notice all the regulatory compliance\nthere that they are mentioning.\n\n324\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.185\nDepartment of Defense, we kind of just\nseen that one, there's a bunch of them out\n\n325\n00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:51.543\nthere, and it is the 800 document I\ncouldn't remember the actual 88 but\n\n326\n00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:53.570\n800 documents information security.\n\n327\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.696\n&gt;&gt; The NSA never said anything.\n\n328\n00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:56.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, yeah,\n\n329\n00:17:56.021 --> 00:17:59.660\n[LAUGH] we'll leave that\none alone [LAUGH] for sure.\n\n330\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.986\nBut here's other things, if don't scroll\npast it, HIPAA that's the big one.\n\n331\n00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:08.662\nThe Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act,\n\n332\n00:18:08.662 --> 00:18:12.274\nthat's your PHI your protected\nhealthcare information.\n\n333\n00:18:12.274 --> 00:18:16.680\nSo these are types and they tell you\nall the services that they have,\n\n334\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.324\ndata destruction services\non site hard drive erasure.\n\n335\n00:18:20.324 --> 00:18:22.873\nSo like you were saying\nbring the truck out, and\n\n336\n00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:26.030\nwill degauss those hard drives\nright there on the site.\n\n337\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.518\nData center decommissioning,\n\n338\n00:18:28.518 --> 00:18:33.870\nwe're bringing down entire floors\nwith a thousand servers in them.\n\n339\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.310\nSo, a lot of great services\nthat are provided here\n\n340\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.420\nif your company can afford\nto have these on site.\n\n341\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.690\nA lot of companies really can't justify\nspending all of that money if they\n\n342\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.510\nare only gonna do this once.\n\n343\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.780\nOr if they are only gonna do it\nonce every four years, five years,\n\n344\n00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.922\nusually your ROI, return on investment and\nI can't think exactly what it is.\n\n345\n00:18:54.922 --> 00:18:59.226\nI want to say it's at least three years\nbut sometimes maybe four or five years.\n\n346\n00:18:59.226 --> 00:19:03.792\nSo nobody's going to want to spend $40,000\non two pieces of equipment that they're\n\n347\n00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:05.950\ngoing to use once in four years at best.\n\n348\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.734\n&gt;&gt; Probably not the best use\nof your economic status there.\n\n349\n00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:11.026\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, so\n\n350\n00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.940\nthese are some of the things we want\nyou to keep in mind for the exam.\n\n351\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.684\nSo that if they throw you in\na scenario where they say hey,\n\n352\n00:19:17.684 --> 00:19:21.700\nwhich of these would properly\ndestroy the information?\n\n353\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.430\nYou'll know which techniques to use.\n\n354\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.160\nPaper media.\n\n355\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.410\nWe're gonna use the shredding.\n\n356\n00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.070\nIf we're gonna, physical destruction\nis one of the best things.\n\n357\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.790\nDrill.\nHammer.\n\n358\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.700\nIf you will.\n\n359\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.290\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that\ninside of this hard drives, if I was to\n\n360\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.180\nopen one of the hard drives and I was to\nlook at the platters that are within them.\n\n361\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.010\nThey have balancers and\n\n362\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:45.200\nalignments in there that a lot of times,\nnot all the time but a lot of times,\n\n363\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.030\nonce you open a hard drive, you've\nalmost ruined the data that's in there.\n\n364\n00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.780\nNow there are very sophisticated\nlaboratories out there.\n\n365\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.220\nAnd then once you pull the balancers off\nof them, they're aligned perfectly for\n\n366\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.672\nthe drive controller it's almost next to\nimpossible to put them back together.\n\n367\n00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:06.005\nOnce those balancers are off you pretty\nmuch have lost access to the data,\n\n368\n00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:11.510\neven more so if you scrap the platters if\nthey happen to be a laptop hard drives\n\n369\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.500\nthat have the platter so actually\nglass coated in a metal if you will,\n\n370\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.284\ncover them in tape you could\nhit them with a hammer and\n\n371\n00:20:20.284 --> 00:20:24.630\nthey shatter to a million pieces,\nor however many pieces.\n\n372\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.500\nSo just keep that in mind as well.\n\n373\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.990\nThe last thing I will say is solid\nstate drives they are degaussing.\n\n374\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.430\nIt doesn't really help with them,\noverwriting.\n\n375\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.120\nExcuse me I'm sorry, overwriting.\n\n376\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.280\nDegaussing can help but a lot of times\nwhat you'd like to do is you melt them and\n\n377\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.600\nincinerate them because the standard\noverwriting techniques, that's a big one.\n\n378\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.110\nAnd that's an exam alert too.\n\n379\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.190\nA mechanical drive,\na traditional mechanical drive,\n\n380\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.000\nyou can do the overwriting too.\n\n381\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.920\nI'll get it right eventually.\n\n382\n00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:58.210\nOverwriting works on magnetic,\nmechanical drives.\n\n383\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.260\nOverwriting doesn't work\non a solid state drive.\n\n384\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:05.120\nAnd that's just do it to the way\nthat it does, it's right procedure.\n\n385\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.103\nIt doesn't do it the same way\nthat your mechanical drives do.\n\n386\n00:21:08.103 --> 00:21:12.289\nSo if you get on the exam and\nthey ask you about a solid state drive,\n\n387\n00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:14.955\ndon't use overwriting as a potential for\n\n388\n00:21:14.955 --> 00:21:18.572\ndata destruction use pretty\nmuch any of the other ones.\n\n389\n00:21:18.572 --> 00:21:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, you definitely laid\nout the fact that we have data,\n\n390\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.100\nwe need to keep it secure even\nif we are decommissioning data.\n\n391\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.110\nMaybe that data is old maybe\nwhatever you don't know\n\n392\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.256\nwhat could be used in a way that\nwe would not like it to be.\n\n393\n00:21:33.256 --> 00:21:38.150\nWe have to protect sensitive information\nand doing that through some types of\n\n394\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.620\ndestruction, the magnetic reading,\ndegaussing, the overwriting plenty of\n\n395\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:48.050\ndifferent ways in which you can get into\nthat business of making sure the data is\n\n396\n00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:53.090\nunrecoverable by maybe some bad actor\nout there, wanting to get a hold of it.\n\n397\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.406\nWes, thanks so much for dropping by and\ntalking about that Data Destruction and\n\n398\n00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:57.555\nhow important it is for us.\n\n399\n00:21:57.555 --> 00:22:01.856\nHopefully, you guys got a lot of great\ntidbits of information out of this episode\n\n400\n00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:04.269\npreparing you a little more for\nthe A+ exam.\n\n401\n00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:08.552\nThat being said though,\nwe are out of time for this show.\n\n402\n00:22:08.552 --> 00:22:09.620\nSo we're gonna call it a day.\n\n403\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.690\nThanks for watching,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n404\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n405\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.478\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n406\n00:22:14.478 --> 00:22:20.561\n[MUSIC]\n\n407\n00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:23.417\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.543 --> 00:00:08.407\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:12.118\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:14.026\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:16.597\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.227\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:22.530\nAnd in today's episode we are back with\nmore in our A Plus Accelerated series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.090\n&gt;&gt; Joining us back in the studio,\nyet again, to lend his expertise,\n\n10\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.430\nour good friend and mentor, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.930\nWes, welcome back sir, how are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.340\nBe going even better if you brought plenty\nof tin foil for this episode, right?\n\n14\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.350\n&gt;&gt; It's a security episode.\n\n15\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, he knows it.\n\n16\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.430\nThat's right.\n\n17\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.460\nIt's great to be here,\ngood to be back in our accelerated track.\n\n18\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.510\nKeep in mind that as we move very fast,\nthe accelerated track,\n\n19\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.510\nthere is a little bit\nof assumed knowledge.\n\n20\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.470\nAnd we're gonna dive in to well,\nsecuring SOHOs.\n\n21\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.310\nNow, if you're looking at exam objectives\nout there, keep in mind that they talk\n\n22\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.623\nabout wireless, and\nthey talk about wired networks.\n\n23\n00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:57.196\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n24\n00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:01.737\nthere are some of the things that you can\ndo will affect both networks, all right?\n\n25\n00:01:01.737 --> 00:01:03.170\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n26\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.304\nThat's why I kinda lumped\nthem all together here and\n\n27\n00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:06.770\njust said securing SOHOs, right?\n\n28\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.360\nSo, cuz if we talk about things\nlike Mac filtering, right?\n\n29\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.890\nIs Mac filtering just a wireless solution?\n\n30\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.200\nAnd the answer is no, not really, right?\n\n31\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.150\nWhen you do Port Security on even like\na Cisco based switch, Port Security says,\n\n32\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.651\nhey, I see this Mac address\nsending information into the port,\n\n33\n00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.680\nand it doesn't match\nthe one I have on my list.\n\n34\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.420\nWell, guess what?\n\n35\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.328\nWe shut the port down.\n\n36\n00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:26.730\nSo, and that's a wired connection.\n\n37\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.503\nSo some of these things will work for\nboth wired and wireless, but then again,\n\n38\n00:01:30.503 --> 00:01:32.800\nsome of them are specific to wireless,\nright?\n\n39\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.763\nIf I start talking about an SSID,\nright, a server set identifier, right?\n\n40\n00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:41.364\nThat's not really something you're\ngonna see on a wired network.\n\n41\n00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:43.345\nSo there are some things\nthat are specific.\n\n42\n00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:44.055\nAnd let's go ahead,\n\n43\n00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:48.890\nlet's talk about some of those wireless\nspecific implementations, right?\n\n44\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.900\nFirst of all,\nis changing the default SSID.\n\n45\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.941\nSpeaking of service set identifier,\nremember what the server set\n\n46\n00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:56.936\nidentifier is that we talked about\nin some of the other episodes?\n\n47\n00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:01.454\nIn both our full A plus 901, 902,\nseries and even in some of the accelerated\n\n48\n00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.675\nepisodes, we talked about\nthat service set identifier.\n\n49\n00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:07.030\nAgain, it's just an alphanumeric string.\n\n50\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.080\nI think it's 32-bits if I remember right.\n\n51\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.030\nBut we see it as a network name, right?\n\n52\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.130\nAnd so,\nif you ever hear of network name, well,\n\n53\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.410\nit doesn't have to be so technical, but\nit is technically a service identifier.\n\n54\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.970\nIt basically identifies\nthe access point the network, and\n\n55\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.080\nthen all the devices that\nare attached to the network.\n\n56\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.408\nNow, when you first get a router,\nwhen you got a home router, if you will,\n\n57\n00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:33.819\nor wireless access point,\nit has a default SSID, all right?\n\n58\n00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.659\nAnd that is from the moment you pull it\nout of the box, you plug the power in and\n\n59\n00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.664\nyou fire it up, turn it on,\nit comes online and guess what?\n\n60\n00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:43.580\nIf wireless is turned on,\nyou have a default SSID.\n\n61\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.670\nNow, Dan,\n\n62\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.040\nI got a question here because I know you\nwear the black cat occasionally there.\n\n63\n00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.780\nWhy do you think I might wanna\nsteer away from a default,\n\n64\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.960\nspecifically a default SSID?\n\n65\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, because it makes it really easy\nfor people to identify your network.\n\n66\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.570\nOr not so much identification purposes,\nyou do want to be able to identify\n\n67\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.361\nyour own network apart from\nother people out there.\n\n68\n00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:06.790\nBut when you stick with the defaults,\n\n69\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.640\nyou're probably sticking\nwith other defaults as well.\n\n70\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.560\nAnd that makes it easy for people that\nare trying to break into wireless\n\n71\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.410\nnetworks to figure that out and\nuse those defaults against you.\n\n72\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.305\nMaybe you left your default username and\npassword there, and they can log\n\n73\n00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:24.095\nin using that, and it's an easily found\nthing just by doing a quick Google search.\n\n74\n00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:26.785\n&gt;&gt; And that's what's great about having\nsomebody that does penetration testing\n\n75\n00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:29.295\nsitting next to you in this episode,\nbecause that's exactly it, right?\n\n76\n00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.625\nYou start doing profiling.\n\n77\n00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.634\nI say that you got a default SSID.\n\n78\n00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:34.212\nDan said some of those other defaults,\nright?\n\n79\n00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:35.832\nWell, what do you mean?\n\n80\n00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.752\nWell, default username and\npassword to the router, right?\n\n81\n00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.762\nOr the home wireless router, if you will.\n\n82\n00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.092\nIn fact, let me show you here.\n\n83\n00:03:42.092 --> 00:03:45.337\nI'm on a Linksys router web interface,\nright?\n\n84\n00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:49.436\nAnd you can see that if I've got\na default SSID, I do have the chance for\n\n85\n00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:52.616\nit to be a default username and password.\n\n86\n00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:53.756\nAnd here's the problem with that.\n\n87\n00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:56.116\nIf somebody like Dan, and\nI'm picking on Dan here,\n\n88\n00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:59.502\nhe's not gonna hack your network, right?\n\n89\n00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:00.990\nBut he's gotta teach a lot of this stuff.\n\n90\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.000\nSo one of the things that you would\nlook for is that default SSID that says,\n\n91\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.560\nhey, that's exactly what Linksys\nset up out of the box, right?\n\n92\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400\nSo chances are, if you've got that,\nyou're probably not savvy enough, or\n\n93\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.290\nwhoever it was that set up\nthe wireless access point,\n\n94\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.170\nsavvy enough to know that you need to\nchange this username and password.\n\n95\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.930\nSo we can go out, and we can do something\nlike, for instance, let me see.\n\n96\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.077\nI'll tell you what, let's get\nGoogle here and let's do a Linksys,\n\n97\n00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:31.981\nI can't remember what I\nconnected to there, 8350, right?\n\n98\n00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:38.110\n8350 username and password.\n\n99\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.600\nLook at that,\nit even comes up in the list.\n\n100\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.480\nI don't even have to finish the search.\n\n101\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Admin and nothing or\nadmin admin or nothing in admin.\n\n102\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.710\n&gt;&gt; That's right and look here.\n\n103\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.390\nUser name field blank.\n\n104\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.700\nDefault password is admin, all right?\n\n105\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.852\nNow keep in mind-\n&gt;&gt; So within three attempts,\n\n106\n00:04:55.852 --> 00:04:58.310\nI've broken directly in.\n\n107\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.280\n&gt;&gt; All based on founding out-\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even have to Google that.\n\n108\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.300\nIt just came from experience to know that.\n\n109\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.750\nCuz that's a very common set of\nusername and password defaults.\n\n110\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.485\n&gt;&gt; And now from here, let's go,\nlet's follow this line of thinking.\n\n111\n00:05:10.485 --> 00:05:12.166\nRight now,\nwe're logged in to your router, right?\n\n112\n00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:13.860\nWe're logged in to the Home Access Point.\n\n113\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.010\nSo let's go ahead and we do that.\n\n114\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.860\nWell, now, and no LastPass,\nI'm okay with that.\n\n115\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.250\nNow, we've got a problem here, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.490\nNow, don't worry about this specific\nwireless interface right here.\n\n117\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.150\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nsay okay to that.\n\n118\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.900\nBut now we've got access\nto your entire router.\n\n119\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.230\nThe worst case, and the worst part about\nthis is we can actually just shut it down\n\n120\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.890\nhere, and now you've got denial of\nservice, you do not have access to it.\n\n121\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.520\nSo, that's one of the reasons you wanna\ndo things by changing and, changing\n\n122\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.430\ndefault user names, changing default\npasswords, changing the default SSID.\n\n123\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.380\nLet me show you what I mean here, right?\n\n124\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.730\nSo, if we go into wireless, and\n\n125\n00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.030\nlet me turn, I'll mentioned this one\nhere while we were here, too, right?\n\n126\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.420\nYou see this one here,\nWi-Fi Protected Setup?\n\n127\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.580\nIt had good intentions, right?\n\n128\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.950\nWhen the market came out with this,\nit had really good intentions.\n\n129\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.500\nIs that we could do Wi-Fi protected setup,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.210\nAnd you could have some kind of PIN,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.186\nA PIN on the back of the router, and\nyou could enter this PIN when you go to\n\n132\n00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:12.231\nconnect to the network, and\nthen they could communicate to the device,\n\n133\n00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.435\nif you will, and the access point and\nset it up for you very easily, right?\n\n134\n00:06:16.435 --> 00:06:20.315\nI don't want to technically call\nit a zero config technology, but\n\n135\n00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:24.001\nwas reduced configuration at best,\nand it could do it for you.\n\n136\n00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:25.730\nProblem is, it isn't secure.\n\n137\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.470\nSo the first thing I do is I disable it.\n\n138\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.220\nGo ahead and get away from\ndisabling wi-fi protected set up.\n\n139\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.270\n&gt;&gt; But, Wes, it says protected set up.\n\n140\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.074\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n141\n00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:37.583\nIt's only keeping the legitimate\npeople out of your network, right?\n\n142\n00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:39.644\nDoes nothing for the hackers.\n\n143\n00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:43.170\nBut I guess better than nothing, but\nmight as well be nothing security.\n\n144\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.590\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndisable this and-\n\n145\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.200\n&gt;&gt; You know what, though,\n\n146\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.477\nI would agree with you.\n\n147\n00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:48.220\nYou say it's better than nothing.\n\n148\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.960\nIt really isn't, in my opinion, because it\ngives people a false sense of security.\n\n149\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.080\nThey think, I did the wi-fi\nprotected set up, I'm protected.\n\n150\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.840\nNo, you're not.\n\n151\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.260\nIt made it really easy for\n\n152\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.690\nyou to have some level of protection\nthat's really no level at all.\n\n153\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.270\nAnd you'll feel rested assured.\n\n154\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.830\nThat's not a good place to be.\n\n155\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.120\nYou wanna go into these, you wanna\nmanually configure this, understand each\n\n156\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.960\none of the security settings do, so\nthat you can actually be protected.\n\n157\n00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and when we turn and\nwe get away from Wi-Fi Protected Setup,\n\n158\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.020\nnotice that I have Linksys,\nI got this name right here, right?\n\n159\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.270\nWell, remember I told you Network Name,\nSSID, kind of one and the same.\n\n160\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.100\nBut, with an SSID like this, now,\n\n161\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.600\nunderstand that you're more obscuring\nthings, let me be careful when I say this.\n\n162\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.380\nIt's telling you exactly what Network\nyou are on, the 5GHz Network.\n\n163\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Chances are, I'm on a end network, or\n\n164\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.160\ntoday, an AC network.\n\n165\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.020\nA is out there for technology, but\nI doubt you're really gonna see too\n\n166\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.190\nmany of the A devices anymore just\ncuz it's such an old technology.\n\n167\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.280\nBut, I don't really need the SSID to\nfigure out what frequency you're on.\n\n168\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.335\nAll I need is a wireless scanner.\n\n169\n00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:53.755\nBut with this wireless scanner,\n\n170\n00:07:53.755 --> 00:07:56.655\nI now see that you're running some\nkind of Linksys device, right?\n\n171\n00:07:56.655 --> 00:08:01.191\nSo, one of the things that you wanna do\nis come in here And rename this, right?\n\n172\n00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.912\nDan, you got a creative name?\n\n173\n00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:05.088\n&gt;&gt; I like to use fuzzy hats.\n\n174\n00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzy hats, okay.\n\n175\n00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.988\nSo we'll use FuzzyHats for this one.\n\n176\n00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:13.218\nAnd I'm gonna go down here,\nand I like to scare people so\n\n177\n00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:17.370\nI'm gonna change this network,\nor SSID, to FBIVan.\n\n178\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.793\nAll right, so go ahead and\nconnect if you want.\n\n179\n00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:23.197\nNow please-\n&gt;&gt; On the monitor it looks like it says\n\n180\n00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:23.865\nFuzzyHate.\n\n181\n00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:26.388\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does, it does, FuzzyHate.\n\n182\n00:08:26.388 --> 00:08:27.262\nNo, no, no hate.\n\n183\n00:08:27.262 --> 00:08:28.099\nNo hate, no hate, no hate.\n\n184\n00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:28.923\n&gt;&gt; It's not, it's FuzzyHats.\n\n185\n00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:30.332\n&gt;&gt; We're bringing the fuzzy hats,\nthat's right.\n\n186\n00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:33.596\n[LAUGH] So\nthese are things that you wanna do, right?\n\n187\n00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:37.177\nWell, here's one thing that they do say.\n\n188\n00:08:37.177 --> 00:08:38.453\nThey say disable the SSID.\n\n189\n00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:42.628\nThat's another thing that only keeps\nthe legitimate people out of your network.\n\n190\n00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:46.291\nAnd the reason I say that is if you\nhave a wireless spectrum analyzer,\n\n191\n00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.830\nnot even a spectrum analyzer,\njust a wireless network analyzer,\n\n192\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.990\nyou could still see what the network is.\n\n193\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.070\nI can still find out information.\n\n194\n00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.188\nBut what it does is It keeps\nit out of the list, right?\n\n195\n00:08:58.188 --> 00:09:02.800\nEvery computer that you have that has\na wireless adapter has one of these lists.\n\n196\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.316\nAnd the reason we know about\nthese access points, right,\n\n197\n00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:10.049\nis because my computer,\npart of the 802.11 standard,\n\n198\n00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.879\nis sending out these little\nstation STA probes they call them.\n\n199\n00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.750\nYour wireless device is a station.\n\n200\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.001\nThe access point is the managing device.\n\n201\n00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.583\nAnd an AP, according to the standard,\n\n202\n00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:24.666\nis supposed to respond back to you and\nsay, here I am, right?\n\n203\n00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:25.646\nAnd we'll probably see this.\n\n204\n00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:27.350\nNotice it says looking for\nnetworks out there?\n\n205\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.938\nSo my computer's sending out these probes.\n\n206\n00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:33.111\nAnd what happens is if you're\nbroadcasting that SSID right there,\n\n207\n00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:38.174\nthen what this access point is configured\nto do is to respond back to that, right?\n\n208\n00:09:38.174 --> 00:09:40.520\nWell, when you disable that,\nit keeps it out of that list.\n\n209\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.950\nBut you have to understand that\npart of security is availability.\n\n210\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.320\nWe talked about the CIA triad.\n\n211\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.039\nConfidentiality through encryption,\nmaking sure the data's scrambled.\n\n212\n00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.519\nIntegrity, making sure\nthat it doesn't change,\n\n213\n00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.430\nthat it maintains its original state.\n\n214\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.312\nAnd then finally, is availability, making\nsure that if Dan is an authorized user,\n\n215\n00:09:57.312 --> 00:09:59.060\nand I send him a piece of information,\n\n216\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.395\nit's available to him when\nhe needs access to it.\n\n217\n00:10:01.395 --> 00:10:05.266\nWell, the problem is when you disable\nan SSID, you could make your network\n\n218\n00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:08.660\nunavailable to the people that\nit should actually be connected.\n\n219\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.470\nCuz now what they have to know is\nthey have to know the network name.\n\n220\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.234\nNot only do they have to\nknow the network name,\n\n221\n00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:18.123\nthey have to know what encryption type,\nand they have to manually set that.\n\n222\n00:10:18.123 --> 00:10:21.590\nWe're gonna see some of the encryption\ntypes here coming up in a second.\n\n223\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.424\nAnd here's the problem, think about that.\n\n224\n00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:27.910\nHow will people a lot of times like\nto pass that information over to you?\n\n225\n00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.268\nWell, I'm gonna write it down, or\nI'm gonna send it in an email.\n\n226\n00:10:32.268 --> 00:10:34.953\nIf you've got a hacker,\nand you've disabled that,\n\n227\n00:10:34.953 --> 00:10:37.630\nchances are they probably\ncan see your email, too.\n\n228\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.053\nSo they're gonna find that information\none way or the another, and\n\n229\n00:10:40.053 --> 00:10:41.680\nyou're really just making it more complex.\n\n230\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd liken it to hidden folders\ninside of Windows, or Linux, or\n\n231\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.040\nwhatever, right?\n\n232\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.774\nThey're hidden, yeah.\n\n233\n00:10:46.774 --> 00:10:49.538\nBut they're still there, and\nall you got to do is go,\n\n234\n00:10:49.538 --> 00:10:53.440\nShow hidden folders in the folder options,\nand now I see them.\n\n235\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.167\nIt's kind of like that.\n\n236\n00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:57.860\nYes, that SSID is not being broadcast.\n\n237\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.920\nBut any hacker worth his salt is going\nto be able to intercept traffic that has\n\n238\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.438\nthe SSID in it that is being broadcasted,\nand then just extrapolate it out of there.\n\n239\n00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:07.665\nIt doesn't take very long to do.\n\n240\n00:11:07.665 --> 00:11:11.867\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, cuz there's information\nthat's travelling across a wireless\n\n241\n00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:13.910\nnetwork that you and I never see.\n\n242\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.832\nOur computers and\nthe access point are communicating.\n\n243\n00:11:15.832 --> 00:11:17.330\nThey have management frames.\n\n244\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.158\nThey have beaconing.\n\n245\n00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:20.730\nYou'll learn about frames when\nyou go into networking, right,\n\n246\n00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.106\ndown there at the data link layer.\n\n247\n00:11:22.106 --> 00:11:24.446\nThere's management\ninformation that's going on,\n\n248\n00:11:24.446 --> 00:11:27.367\nthat's being passed between our\naccess points on the computers.\n\n249\n00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:29.624\nAnd in that management information,\nguess what?\n\n250\n00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:32.206\nLike Dan mentioned,\nif I can scrape that packet,\n\n251\n00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:35.726\nscrape that frame off and look at it,\nthat SSID is in there, right?\n\n252\n00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:40.103\nSo understand that, you put it great\nat the beginning of the episode.\n\n253\n00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:45.207\nIt might give you false sense\nsecurity that, hey, I've done this.\n\n254\n00:11:45.207 --> 00:11:48.040\nRemember, it's not just one\nthing that you're doing, right?\n\n255\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.098\nIt's layered defense system,\ndefense in depth.\n\n256\n00:11:50.098 --> 00:11:55.140\nWe're not just taking one tactic, and\nsaying, that is the stopgap to everything.\n\n257\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.689\nThat is gonna protect me.\n\n258\n00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:59.058\nYou're actually kind of\nmultitudes of things,\n\n259\n00:11:59.058 --> 00:12:02.585\nmultiple things that you're implementing\non your wireless network and\n\n260\n00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:05.660\nwired networks for\nthat matter, to keep them safe.\n\n261\n00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.652\nThe other thing they talk about, and\nyou have to be careful on this one.\n\n262\n00:12:08.652 --> 00:12:11.400\nFor instance, this access point\nhere's not gonna really help us.\n\n263\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.842\nLet me go ahead and\nclose that down background, there.\n\n264\n00:12:13.842 --> 00:12:15.578\nThey talk about radio levels.\n\n265\n00:12:15.578 --> 00:12:22.025\nThere really isn't too much\nradio level that l can do here.\n\n266\n00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:25.886\nDepending on the complexity of the access\npoint, sometimes, you can peak and\n\n267\n00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:26.833\ntweak the radios.\n\n268\n00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:31.603\nAgain, but this is more for\nmaking sure that your signal isn't\n\n269\n00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:36.553\nbleeding over into the parking lot,\nwhere somebody's out there\n\n270\n00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:41.235\nwith an cantenna, and\nthey're scraping your information.\n\n271\n00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:43.623\nI will tell you,\nif you're talking about a SOHO network,\n\n272\n00:12:43.623 --> 00:12:45.360\ngo with directional antennas.\n\n273\n00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.150\nPlace your antennas.\n\n274\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.335\nMake sure that if you need coverage,\n\n275\n00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:52.422\nhighly directional antennas on at\nthe outskirts of the building that\n\n276\n00:12:52.422 --> 00:12:55.460\nare pointing back into\nthe middle of the building.\n\n277\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.222\nAnd omnidirectional\n\n278\n00:12:56.222 --> 00:12:58.635\nantenna that's only covering\nthe middle of the building, right?\n\n279\n00:12:58.635 --> 00:13:01.992\nSo again,\nthe amount that you can do this, right,\n\n280\n00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:06.300\nI think goes a little bit farther\nthan what the average person do.\n\n281\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.264\nThey have entire certifications built\naround just controlling the power levels\n\n282\n00:13:11.264 --> 00:13:14.697\nof your interfaces here that\nyou can't really do it in.\n\n283\n00:13:14.697 --> 00:13:18.270\nAnd that's why I say I think it's\na little bit beyond the SOHO environment.\n\n284\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.278\nIt's more of an enterprise class,\nbut they do mention it.\n\n285\n00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:26.580\nSome of the other things that you can do,\nas well, is enable MAC filtering.\n\n286\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.228\nSo for instance,\nyou'll see Wireless MAC Filter here.\n\n287\n00:13:29.228 --> 00:13:33.460\nIf I decide to enable this, and\nlet me see here, and that's okay,\n\n288\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.790\nI don't care about Wi-Fi Protected Setup.\n\n289\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.124\nNotice that if I enable it,\n\n290\n00:13:38.124 --> 00:13:41.377\nI can do a kind of like the blacklist\nversus the white list, right?\n\n291\n00:13:41.377 --> 00:13:46.486\nI can prevent the PCs from joining\n\n292\n00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:53.795\nmy network if their MAC\naddress is in this list.\n\n293\n00:13:53.795 --> 00:13:58.562\nI can allow them access to this network,\nright, in the white list,\n\n294\n00:13:58.562 --> 00:14:01.165\nif their MAC address is in this list.\n\n295\n00:14:01.165 --> 00:14:03.799\nAgain, this definitely by\nitself should never be trusted.\n\n296\n00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:06.014\nAnd the reason I say that is because we\ntalk about in other another episodes,\n\n297\n00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:06.958\nwe talk about virtualization.\n\n298\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:07.836\nWell, guess what?\nI have five virtual machines running on my\n\n299\n00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:08.707\ncomputer that only has one\nphysical network adapter.\n\n300\n00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:09.623\nHow do you think they\ncommunicate with the network and\n\n301\n00:14:09.623 --> 00:14:10.326\nare seen as several separate entities?\n\n302\n00:14:10.326 --> 00:14:13.010\nSoftware is making up their MAC address.\n\n303\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.940\nSo it's very easy to change a MAC address.\n\n304\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.719\nNot at the physical level\non the network adapter.\n\n305\n00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:21.590\nThat's a hardware burned-in identifier.\n\n306\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.502\nBut if I've got software,\ni can make manipulations that can change\n\n307\n00:14:24.502 --> 00:14:27.685\nthat MAC address, and then can actually,\nin fact, let me show you here.\n\n308\n00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:29.612\nI'll show you, it's this easy.\n\n309\n00:14:29.612 --> 00:14:34.056\nLet me scoot on over here\nto my virtual machine.\n\n310\n00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:36.047\nAnd if I look at the network adapter.\n\n311\n00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:38.090\nLet me look at the network\nadapter settings.\n\n312\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.581\nNotice the MAC address here?\n\n313\n00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:41.830\nYou'll see it right here.\n\n314\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.252\nAnd it's grayed out cuz this virtual\nmachine is in a suspended state,\n\n315\n00:14:45.252 --> 00:14:48.219\na paused state,\nfrom another episode that we're gonna do.\n\n316\n00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:49.630\nBut do you see that right there?\n\n317\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.929\nRight next to the MAC address,\nlook what it says.\n\n318\n00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:53.470\nIt says, Generate, all right?\n\n319\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.476\nSo this is the current MAC address that\nthis virtual machine is gonna give off,\n\n320\n00:14:57.476 --> 00:14:58.092\nall right?\n\n321\n00:14:58.092 --> 00:15:02.694\nIf I have a wireless analyzer out there,\nand I can potentially see,\n\n322\n00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:07.538\nput it in a mode where I can all\nthe communications from all of the devices\n\n323\n00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:09.350\nthat are on your network.\n\n324\n00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.366\nAnd I can find one of the legitimate\ndevices, MAC addresses,\n\n325\n00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:13.352\nguess what I can do?\n\n326\n00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:16.370\nI can program it in the virtual machine.\n\n327\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.293\nAnd now to your access point, it kinda\ngets around that, and it kinda spoofs it.\n\n328\n00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:24.070\nIt makes it look like it is\na legitimate MAC address for\n\n329\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.110\na computer that's on your\nnetwork when it really isn't.\n\n330\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.190\nSo I just say be careful with that one.\n\n331\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.565\nMAC addressing by itself,\n\n332\n00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:37.252\nMAC filtering should never be\nthe one size fits all, if you will.\n\n333\n00:15:37.252 --> 00:15:40.826\nOther things that you might have,\ntoo, things like security, right?\n\n334\n00:15:40.826 --> 00:15:45.478\nThe level at which you can configure\ndepends on your wireless access\n\n335\n00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:46.954\npoint that you have.\n\n336\n00:15:46.954 --> 00:15:52.121\nYou can get into things like potentially\nmaking rules, and stuff like.\n\n337\n00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:53.596\nA little bit beyond the scope of the exam.\n\n338\n00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:56.235\nHowever, we do have things like,\n\n339\n00:15:56.235 --> 00:16:00.698\nI know you Work with firewall-CMD and\nIP tables in Linux.\n\n340\n00:16:00.698 --> 00:16:05.480\nSo you do have certain pieces of software\nthat you can put on these devices.\n\n341\n00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.654\nAgain, it's beyond this exam, however,\n\n342\n00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:11.790\nyou can see that we can at least enable\nthings like Staple Packet Inspection, SPI.\n\n343\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.107\nThat's what that acronym right there,\nSPI stands for.\n\n344\n00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:18.738\nJust means that now the firewall can\nactually look at the information and say,\n\n345\n00:16:18.738 --> 00:16:21.756\nhey, this information\nmight say that it's HTTP,\n\n346\n00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:26.478\nor it might say port whatever, but I can\nlook at it, and I know what's going on.\n\n347\n00:16:26.478 --> 00:16:28.463\nI can see,\nI can read that information, and\n\n348\n00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:31.590\nthen you can do things like filtering\nanonymous Internet requests.\n\n349\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.650\nThat's great to keep random ICMP\ncommunications and stuff from going\n\n350\n00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.190\nthrough the access point and targeting\ndevices on the inside of your network so\n\n351\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.695\nyou can see that you can do things\nlike web filtering as well or\n\n352\n00:16:43.695 --> 00:16:44.971\ncontent filtering.\n\n353\n00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:48.410\nYou also have the ability to do\nthings like parental controls too.\n\n354\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:53.052\nLet's see, I think it's in administration,\nno you know what, I was probably right\n\n355\n00:16:53.052 --> 00:16:57.402\nthere so VPN pass through access policy,\nthere we go, that's access policy.\n\n356\n00:16:57.402 --> 00:17:01.049\nThey're slightly different interfaces,\nfor the most part,\n\n357\n00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:03.798\nWRT is almost got them in\nthe same location, but\n\n358\n00:17:03.798 --> 00:17:07.717\nnotice I can do parental controls,\nand we can do specific devices,\n\n359\n00:17:07.717 --> 00:17:12.231\nrestricting their internet access,\nwe can schedule it for certain nights.\n\n360\n00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:16.151\nI can say, okay well my child is only\ngonna be doing homework from, I don't\n\n361\n00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:21.132\nknow, lets say 5:30 in the afternoon until\n6.30 in the afternoon, so I'm gonna allow\n\n362\n00:17:21.132 --> 00:17:24.988\nthem that time or maybe it's on a weekend,\nyou give them an hour at a time,\n\n363\n00:17:24.988 --> 00:17:29.140\nand again, you can restrict the level of\naccess and even do URL filtering too.\n\n364\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.255\nWhat else have we got here, Dan,\nthat we have to worry about?\n\n365\n00:17:31.255 --> 00:17:31.873\nThat's a firewall.\n\n366\n00:17:31.873 --> 00:17:35.903\nSo the other thing are some services that\ncould potentially be offered by your\n\n367\n00:17:35.903 --> 00:17:36.710\naccess point.\n\n368\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.720\nIf I go back to services, you'll notice\nthat, this is actually the Internet side.\n\n369\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.450\nWe want the router side, or\nthe LAN side, there we go.\n\n370\n00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.680\nThis is the LAN side.\n\n371\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.487\nWhat I mean by that is the WAN sign, how\nit is your ISP allow you to configure and\n\n372\n00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.318\nconnect to their network,\nthat's there side, right?\n\n373\n00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:57.219\nThis is our side of the tracks,\nour side of the demarcation point.\n\n374\n00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:59.270\nIn my LAN, do I wanna allowed DHCP?\n\n375\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.300\nThis is another one that,\nagain, there's kind of a debate.\n\n376\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.512\nDynamics Host Configuration Protocol\nis great to have.\n\n377\n00:18:08.512 --> 00:18:12.020\nIf you have DHCP, you're offering IP\nAddresses it makes administration on your\n\n378\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.890\nnetworks, reduces the administration.\n\n379\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.940\nIt makes it a lot easier\nto get along in life.\n\n380\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.675\nHowever, it also means that you\ncould potentially offer a device,\n\n381\n00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:23.780\nan IP address, that maybe you don't want.\n\n382\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.945\nI say that's limited if you're doing\neverything else that we've been talking\n\n383\n00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:29.789\nabout here, cuz we haven't even\nmentioned encryption in passwords.\n\n384\n00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:34.309\nHowever, when you do static IP addresses,\nremember you're turning off DHCP and\n\n385\n00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:37.847\nyou are going to manually input\nevery IP address, subnet mask,\n\n386\n00:18:37.847 --> 00:18:42.510\ndefault gateway, and DNS settings on every\ndevice that connects to your network.\n\n387\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.073\nNow, if you're one of these networks that\ndoesn't support a lot of mobile devices,\n\n388\n00:18:46.073 --> 00:18:47.369\nthat might not be a bad option.\n\n389\n00:18:47.369 --> 00:18:50.950\nThat might be a good option if you've got\nlet's say five computers, ten computers,\n\n390\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.405\nand they're statically mapped.\n\n391\n00:18:52.405 --> 00:18:55.370\nYou gotta network printer out there,\nand it never moves.\n\n392\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.130\nThat might be something that you can do,\nyou can manually set it.\n\n393\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.818\nHowever, the complexities of managing\na mobile network that way, I don't\n\n394\n00:19:01.818 --> 00:19:05.694\nreally see that being feasible, because\nthese devices come to your networks.\n\n395\n00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:10.531\nThey connect to the wireless network, they\nleave your network, and you really don't\n\n396\n00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:14.385\nwanna get a bunch of phone calls ten\ntimes in a day just for one device.\n\n397\n00:19:14.385 --> 00:19:17.525\nLet alone 50 devices that potentially\ncan be connecting to your network.\n\n398\n00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:22.310\nSo, yes you can disable DHCP and\nassign static IP addresses, but\n\n399\n00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:27.182\nplease keep in mind that that will\nkeep the administration level up\n\n400\n00:19:27.182 --> 00:19:31.095\nas well as things like\nyour blood pressure too.\n\n401\n00:19:31.095 --> 00:19:32.832\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, a couple more things Dan,\n\n402\n00:19:32.832 --> 00:19:34.570\nI know we're getting close on time.\n\n403\n00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.300\nOne of the things that they\ntalk about is port forwarding.\n\n404\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.911\nPort forwarding is a good thing to have.\n\n405\n00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:43.923\nIf you're trying to connect, let's say\nover a public network, and I wanna connect\n\n406\n00:19:43.923 --> 00:19:47.900\nover the Internet, back into the office,\nand I wanna connect to my work computer.\n\n407\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.444\nWell, in a Windows world we use things\nlike RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol,\n\n408\n00:19:52.444 --> 00:19:57.059\nthe remote desktop connection software,\nand that is using a specific port,\n\n409\n00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:58.066\nport 3389.\n\n410\n00:19:58.066 --> 00:20:03.146\nWell, wouldn't it be nice that when you\nconnect over that network, over the WAN\n\n411\n00:20:03.146 --> 00:20:08.077\ninterface, essentially connecting to\nthe access point through the ISP, and\n\n412\n00:20:08.077 --> 00:20:13.028\nthen you need to go to your LAN, how\ndoes the router know this is port 3389?\n\n413\n00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:15.175\nWhich computer do I send it to?\n\n414\n00:20:15.175 --> 00:20:19.055\nWell, you might want to target that\ncommunication to a specific computer and\n\n415\n00:20:19.055 --> 00:20:21.094\nyou can do things like port forwarding.\n\n416\n00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:25.710\nThey call it port mapping, again,\nit's a directional communication.\n\n417\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.434\nNow, let me show you here in this, you can\ngo to things like application and gaming,\n\n418\n00:20:29.434 --> 00:20:31.749\nand there's a few different\nthings that you can do.\n\n419\n00:20:31.749 --> 00:20:34.541\nYou can do single port forwarding and\nwhen you do that,\n\n420\n00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:39.092\nthat would be something like port 3389 for\nRDP traffic, I want it to go to client O1,\n\n421\n00:20:39.092 --> 00:20:40.630\nand I only want it to go there.\n\n422\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.610\nWhen you have things like gaming and\nstuff like that, and I know this is SOHO\n\n423\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.793\nnetwork, so probably not going to have\na lot of gaming or you won't have a job.\n\n424\n00:20:48.793 --> 00:20:50.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe Friday nights, right?\n\n425\n00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:51.092\nThat's right, you have Friday nights.\n\n426\n00:20:51.092 --> 00:20:53.089\n&gt;&gt; Get their sales numbers and\nwe'll have a game night.\n\n427\n00:20:53.089 --> 00:20:54.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\n\n428\n00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:56.063\nold good days of the LAN parties.\n\n429\n00:20:56.063 --> 00:20:57.394\n&gt;&gt; That's right they are fantastic.\n\n430\n00:20:57.394 --> 00:21:02.104\n&gt;&gt; If you have something like, and it\ncould be an application that you're using,\n\n431\n00:21:02.104 --> 00:21:05.777\nbut it might require a port range,\nyou can do a range of ports.\n\n432\n00:21:05.777 --> 00:21:09.738\nThe other you can do is port triggering\nand the big difference here is\n\n433\n00:21:09.738 --> 00:21:14.620\nport forwarding, once you on that's\nalways on and that doesn't close.\n\n434\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.350\nYou have to use other\ntechniques because if another\n\n435\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:21.070\ncomputer tries to connect to this\nnetwork with port 3389, well guess what,\n\n436\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.830\nthe router's gonna say that\ngoes to this computer.\n\n437\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.921\nWell, port triggering says hey, when\nyou need that port open, we'll open it.\n\n438\n00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:31.190\nWhen you don't need that port\nopen we'll close it down.\n\n439\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.082\nSo a couple of different ways that you\ncan do that, and I don't really think we\n\n440\n00:21:36.082 --> 00:21:40.167\nhave to worry about things like DMZs,\nand certainly not IPv6.\n\n441\n00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:42.570\nLast thing here Dan is firmware.\n\n442\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.416\nFirmware is important, a couple different\nways that you got, one of the things that\n\n443\n00:21:46.416 --> 00:21:51.820\nI would know right away, If I was ever\nto buy an access point like this,\n\n444\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:57.030\nyou see Firmware Version 1.0.0.00,\nchances are it's probably been updated,\n\n445\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.070\nand this is in the box,\noff of the shelf brand new.\n\n446\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.720\nRemember that when you update firmware,\nyou fix functionality flaws.\n\n447\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.947\nA lot of times you implement\nsecurity fixes, and\n\n448\n00:22:04.947 --> 00:22:07.229\nit could give you additional\nfunctionality, and\n\n449\n00:22:07.229 --> 00:22:10.813\nthere's different ways that you can do\nthis, but almost always it's gonna be\n\n450\n00:22:10.813 --> 00:22:14.315\na file that you are gonna upload directly\ninto the interface of this router.\n\n451\n00:22:14.315 --> 00:22:17.515\nYou go out to the manufacturer's website,\nyou download the firmware file, and\n\n452\n00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:21.215\nthen you upload it to this device itself.\n\n453\n00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:25.644\nSo, I believe that in this, I wanna say,\nI think that's under Status, and\n\n454\n00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:29.328\nif we go to Status, no,\nmaybe it is Administration here.\n\n455\n00:22:29.328 --> 00:22:30.936\nThere we go, Administration.\n\n456\n00:22:30.936 --> 00:22:32.666\nYou can see Firmware Upgrade right here.\n\n457\n00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:36.204\nWe go to this interface, and\nyou can choose the file, and\n\n458\n00:22:36.204 --> 00:22:37.918\nyou can start the upgrade.\n\n459\n00:22:37.918 --> 00:22:41.330\nI do wanna make mention of this,\nbe very, very careful.\n\n460\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:46.030\nThey are not kidding when they say\ndo not interrupt this upgrade.\n\n461\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.899\nThey're doing an EEPROM flash,\n\n462\n00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:51.112\nelectrically erasable\nprogrammable read only memory.\n\n463\n00:22:51.112 --> 00:22:53.780\nYou're sending an electrical\ncurrent into flash memory,\n\n464\n00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.882\nthat's why they call it\nflashing if you will.\n\n465\n00:22:55.882 --> 00:23:00.069\nWell, there's a couple of reasons, but\nwe'll deal with that in the hardware part.\n\n466\n00:23:00.069 --> 00:23:04.677\nBut the problem is, if you interrupt this,\nyou can permanently ruin the access point,\n\n467\n00:23:04.677 --> 00:23:06.496\nthey call it, breaking a device.\n\n468\n00:23:06.496 --> 00:23:10.485\nSo, don't upgrade when\nyou're plugged into a UPS\n\n469\n00:23:10.485 --> 00:23:13.840\nsystem where the power might have failed.\n\n470\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.675\nDon't upgrade or flash your\nfirmware during a lightning storm,\n\n471\n00:23:16.675 --> 00:23:18.900\nwhere there's a potential for\nthe power to go off.\n\n472\n00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.660\nMake sure you have good clean power and\nthat you will not interrupt it,\n\n473\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.090\nbecause you don't want\nto ruin your device.\n\n474\n00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.729\nIt's one thing to say, hey, if you do\na firmware upgrade you're gonna get a lot\n\n475\n00:23:28.729 --> 00:23:31.879\nmore functionality of your device,\nyou're gonna fix some things,\n\n476\n00:23:31.879 --> 00:23:35.106\nmay be give you additional functionality,\nunless you interrupt it.\n\n477\n00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:36.627\nThen you're gonna get no functionality,\nand\n\n478\n00:23:36.627 --> 00:23:38.930\nyou would've been better [LAUGH] off\njust not upgrading to begin with.\n\n479\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.446\nSo do be careful with\nyour firmware upgrades.\n\n480\n00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:45.543\nAgain, it's something that you\njust gotta approach cautiously.\n\n481\n00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:49.502\nDon't be scared of it just make sure that\nyou're not gonna lose power, because\n\n482\n00:23:49.502 --> 00:23:53.168\nThere's nothing worse than spending\nthe money on a device, doing normal\n\n483\n00:23:53.168 --> 00:23:57.451\nmaintenance on it, routine maintenance,\nand then having to fight with a warranty.\n\n484\n00:23:57.451 --> 00:24:00.595\nCuz a lot of times they're not gonna honor\na warranty if it's user error like that.\n\n485\n00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:02.874\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes,\nI've got one more thing to talk about,\n\n486\n00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:04.955\nwhich is what I like to\ncall caveman security.\n\n487\n00:24:04.955 --> 00:24:07.389\nAnd that's putting a fence around\nthe stinking thing, right?\n\n488\n00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:09.207\nHave somebody watching it.\n\n489\n00:24:09.207 --> 00:24:11.862\nYou can't just let anybody and\ntheir brother walk up to your device and\n\n490\n00:24:11.862 --> 00:24:13.060\nhave access to it, right?\n\n491\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.909\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's crazy if you think-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n492\n00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:17.070\n&gt;&gt; Physical security means anything.\n\n493\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.833\nAnd I'm joking.\n\n494\n00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:20.798\nHe's absolutely right,\nlock and key, right?\n\n495\n00:24:20.798 --> 00:24:24.389\nOne of the things that you'll notice in\nmore corporate-type environments is they\n\n496\n00:24:24.389 --> 00:24:26.299\ntypically have some kind of server closet.\n\n497\n00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:30.142\nNow don't get me wrong, I've seen some\ncompanies that actually have a closet,\n\n498\n00:24:30.142 --> 00:24:31.056\nquite literally.\n\n499\n00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:33.106\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But the point is at least they have\n\n500\n00:24:33.106 --> 00:24:34.830\nsomething.\n\n501\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.860\nThey didn't put the wireless access point\nin the break room on top of the microwave,\n\n502\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.190\nwhere anybody could walk over and\ngain access to it.\n\n503\n00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.460\nLet alone the frequency and the\ninterference that would happen on that.\n\n504\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.360\nIt's behind lock and key.\n\n505\n00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.130\nIt doesn't have to be any kind of\nextravagant type of biometric system.\n\n506\n00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.150\nBut it means it stops casual\naccess to the device,\n\n507\n00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.490\nbecause you never know what could happen.\n\n508\n00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.440\nSo always remember your physical security.\n\n509\n00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.390\nI'm glad you mentioned it.\n\n510\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.700\nLock and key,\nit's your first line of defense.\n\n511\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n512\n00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.684\nAll right, Wes, well,\n\n513\n00:25:07.684 --> 00:25:11.356\nwe've taken a look in this episode on how\nwe can lock down our SOHO environments,\n\n514\n00:25:11.356 --> 00:25:14.498\ndo some security, especially when\nit comes to the wireless access.\n\n515\n00:25:14.498 --> 00:25:17.811\nCuz that's typically what you're gonna\nencounter inside of a small office,\n\n516\n00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:18.974\nhome office environment.\n\n517\n00:25:18.974 --> 00:25:21.119\nIt is a nice little access\npoint sitting somewhere,\n\n518\n00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.078\ngiving everybody their\nInternet connection.\n\n519\n00:25:23.078 --> 00:25:24.905\nAnd we can walk through that and\n\n520\n00:25:24.905 --> 00:25:28.850\ngive you plenty of ways in which\nyou can actually secure the thing.\n\n521\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.686\nAll we have to do is know what those\nways are and how we can implement them.\n\n522\n00:25:31.686 --> 00:25:33.335\nSo very good stuff, Wes.\n\n523\n00:25:33.335 --> 00:25:35.676\nAnything else you would like to add\nto our show before we call it a day?\n\n524\n00:25:35.676 --> 00:25:39.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is one last thing,\nand I almost forgot.\n\n525\n00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:44.510\nI forgot, I got physical security, but the\none thing I didn't mention was encryption.\n\n526\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.418\n&gt;&gt; Aah.\n\n527\n00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:47.438\n&gt;&gt; And I think we'd better\ntouch on that one a little bit.\n\n528\n00:25:47.438 --> 00:25:48.305\n&gt;&gt; Just for a seond, right?\n\n529\n00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:49.172\n&gt;&gt; Just for a second.\n\n530\n00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:51.630\nI was looking at my notes and\nI'm thinking,\n\n531\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.494\nI feel like there's\nsomething that I've missed.\n\n532\n00:25:54.494 --> 00:25:57.218\nAnd I did, so\nlet's dive in here real quick, and\n\n533\n00:25:57.218 --> 00:25:59.688\nremember that in all your communications.\n\n534\n00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:00.803\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n535\n00:26:00.803 --> 00:26:04.325\nAnd we've disabled Wi-Fi,\nwe'll go to the regular Setup, and\n\n536\n00:26:04.325 --> 00:26:06.448\nwe're gonna go to Wireless Security.\n\n537\n00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:08.940\nThat's one thing that I didn't mention.\n\n538\n00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.022\nRemember the different security\nmodes that you have, right?\n\n539\n00:26:12.022 --> 00:26:14.882\nYou pretty much wanna stay away\nfrom Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n540\n00:26:14.882 --> 00:26:18.031\nIt's a fairly weak security,\nit can be cracked in a minute.\n\n541\n00:26:18.031 --> 00:26:18.920\n&gt;&gt; That's being kind.\n\n542\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.898\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n543\n00:26:19.898 --> 00:26:21.685\nit's a really, really weak security.\n\n544\n00:26:21.685 --> 00:26:22.559\nYou wanna stay away from it.\n\n545\n00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:27.565\nWPA was the successor to\nWired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n546\n00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:32.330\nAnd it was a subset of the functionality\nthat would later be released in WPA2.\n\n547\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.183\nYou wanna go with WPA2.\n\n548\n00:26:34.183 --> 00:26:39.070\nIn SOHO environment,\nyou're gonna use WPA2 Personal or WPA.\n\n549\n00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.544\nBut WPA2 Personal cuz it's\nstronger levels of encryption and\n\n550\n00:26:41.544 --> 00:26:43.605\nbasically just means you're\ngonna use a password.\n\n551\n00:26:43.605 --> 00:26:47.467\nThey might call it pre-shared key,\nthey might call it passphrase,\n\n552\n00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:48.809\nthey might call it PSK.\n\n553\n00:26:48.809 --> 00:26:51.730\nDon't let that fool you, it's a password.\n\n554\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.500\nYou go to connect to the wireless network,\nyou enter the password,\n\n555\n00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.490\nyou get connection.\n\n556\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.701\nEnterprise Mode,\nprobably gonna be something that would be\n\n557\n00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:04.664\nwell beyond when it comes to just\nthe sheer scale of a SOHO environment.\n\n558\n00:27:04.664 --> 00:27:08.178\nBecause it requires additional\nauthentication servers and stuff,\n\n559\n00:27:08.178 --> 00:27:11.155\nmore technical equipment,\nwhy they call it Enterprise.\n\n560\n00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:13.795\nJust remember,\nif you get a question on the exam,\n\n561\n00:27:13.795 --> 00:27:15.775\nyou're definitely gonna be using WPA2.\n\n562\n00:27:15.775 --> 00:27:17.546\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Wes,\nthanks for dropping by today.\n\n563\n00:27:17.546 --> 00:27:21.865\nWe do appreciate you showing us all the\ncool security bits inside of our wireless\n\n564\n00:27:21.865 --> 00:27:23.215\naccess points.\n\n565\n00:27:23.215 --> 00:27:26.650\nAnd just some good security\npractices in general when it comes\n\n566\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.022\nto SOHO environments to make sure that\nthey are locked under nice and tightly.\n\n567\n00:27:31.022 --> 00:27:31.585\nThat being said,\n\n568\n00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:33.760\nwe are out of time on this episode,\nso we're gonna call it a day.\n\n569\n00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.480\nThanks for watching.\n\n570\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.280\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n571\n00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.192\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n572\n00:27:38.192 --> 00:27:39.220\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n573\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:46.445\n[MUSIC]\n\n574\n00:27:46.445 --> 00:27:50.855\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Coming at you live\nfrom San Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:08.112\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:10.489\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.687\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\njoining us on ITPRO.TV,\n\n7\n00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:16.030\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.554\nI'm your host Zack Memos for\nthis episode of accelerated A+.\n\n9\n00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:24.491\nAnd we're gonna be trouble shooting PC OS\nissues with the man who can show us how to\n\n10\n00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.750\ndo that trouble shooting Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.420\nHey Wes, good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing Zack?\n\n13\n00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.934\nGreat to be back here and that's right\nwe are moving along ludicrous speed go.\n\n14\n00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Going to plaid.\n\n15\n00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:36.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Remember we are continuing to\n\n16\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.556\nthe accelerated plus track\nhere in our compT A+ series.\n\n17\n00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:43.507\nRemember there is some assumed knowledge,\n\n18\n00:00:43.507 --> 00:00:47.173\nwe do go into some of these\nOS issues pretty in depth, so\n\n19\n00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:52.537\nif you wanna check out more information\ndefinitely check out our full library.\n\n20\n00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:53.920\nWe got all kinds of\ngreat material in there.\n\n21\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But if you're wanting the quick and\n\n22\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.410\nthe dirty review there,\nthat's what we're looking at here.\n\n23\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.120\nSo we're gonna talk about,\njust like Zach said, right?\n\n24\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.960\nThis is the TSHOOT episode,\nwhere we're gonna be looking at,\n\n25\n00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.360\nmore specifically things like\nour Windows operating system and\n\n26\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.040\nsome of the things that you\nmight be confronted with.\n\n27\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.830\nAnd it's kind of interesting, Zach and\nI were joking about before we started\n\n28\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.870\nthe episode, off camera, we always have\nfun here behind the scenes to try to bring\n\n29\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.680\nsome of that personality and\nfun to the screen.\n\n30\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.370\nBut I was saying how hard it is for\nme to break Windows today.\n\n31\n00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.284\n&gt;&gt; Very hard to break Windows,\nthat is a stone cold fact.\n\n32\n00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:33.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the earlier days\nit didn't take much, right?\n\n33\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.960\nEspecially you go back to\nthe earlier days where you had to do\n\n34\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.400\nmanual resource configuration\nbefore plug and play today.\n\n35\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.300\nWhere you had to configure your IRQs,\ninterrupt request lines,\n\n36\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.150\ndirect memory access lines, your\nprogram input, output modes and stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.383\nAnd today we don't really have to do too\nmuch of that because you have this plug\n\n38\n00:01:53.383 --> 00:01:55.050\nand play system, right?\n\n39\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.530\nWe have a system that is in place\nthat when I plug in a device.\n\n40\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.230\nWhen I install a device to the piece\nof hardware that the Windows operating\n\n41\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.670\nsystem, and not only Windows operating\nsystem, all the other operating systems\n\n42\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.040\nsupport plug and play too, will recognize\nthe device, find a driver for it,\n\n43\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.770\neven if it's a generic driver, and load it\ninto the system 32 folder where drivers.\n\n44\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.620\nOr what is it?\n\n45\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.055\nIt's C:\\Windows\\system32\\driver.\n\n46\n00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:26.752\nAnd you'll at least get some basic\ncommunication, so you can start working\n\n47\n00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:30.797\nwith it at least long enough to connect\nto your manufacturer's website, download\n\n48\n00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:34.750\nthe manufacturer defined driver and\nmaybe get the full functionality, right?\n\n49\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.940\nSo it's kinda hard to simulate\nsome of these things without\n\n50\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.310\nbreaking the hardware, right?\n\n51\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.336\nBecause the operating\nsystems do very good,\n\n52\n00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:46.060\nand not just Windows, Linux,\nMac operating systems.\n\n53\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.820\nI've had kernel panics\nwhich is kernel panic.\n\n54\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.687\nWe call it different things in\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n55\n00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:54.325\nA kernel panic in Windows we call it\nthe BSOD, the blue screen of death.\n\n56\n00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n57\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a system stop error,\nand what happens is it's so crucial.\n\n58\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.330\nA lot of times it happens down\nthere in the kernal mode where\n\n59\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.830\nall the kernal executive services and\nthe drivers sit.\n\n60\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.800\nAnd it basically reboots\nthe operating system.\n\n61\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.150\nThe CPU sends out what's known as a GFP,\na general protection fault and\n\n62\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.020\nit basically restarts itself.\n\n63\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.390\nThere are different ones, right?\n\n64\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.720\nAll operating systems have kernel panics,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.170\nIt's just they're called different things.\n\n66\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.240\nI've had them on the Mac, where the Mac\nhas encountered an error and the whole\n\n67\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.110\nthing reboot and you got a proprietary,\nbasically some kind of proprietary\n\n68\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.080\ncrash screen that has a little bit of\ntext that says your Mac has recovered.\n\n69\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.650\nI know we're in PC here but, just in all\nfairness, all of them have it, right?\n\n70\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.410\nLinux will do the same thing.\n\n71\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.140\nA lot of times you might have to\ncheck things like your log files for\n\n72\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.355\na Linux distro.\n\n73\n00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:45.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You might have to go into Sys Log and\n\n74\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.850\nfind this information.\n\n75\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.170\nWindows typically will give you some kind\nof screen to let you know that there's\n\n76\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.860\nbeen a restart.\n\n77\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.999\nIn fact, let me show you here.\n\n78\n00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.052\nLet's see if we can break Windows.\n\n79\n00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:57.054\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I say breaking Windows,\n\n80\n00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:59.480\nsome of you guys might\nrecognize this software.\n\n81\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.250\nThis software is called not my fault.\n\n82\n00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.636\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And it's from Sysinternals out there.\n\n83\n00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:08.580\nAnd I just want to let you guys know that\nthis software isn't breaking my computer.\n\n84\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.795\nAnd if you ever wanna see kind of what\nyou would go through with the blue\n\n85\n00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:15.234\nscreen without damaging the hardware or\ndamaging the operating system,\n\n86\n00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:16.464\nthis is a good way to do it.\n\n87\n00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:19.180\nBut keep in mind it could\npotentially restart your computer.\n\n88\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.250\nSo here is our user account control\nletting me know that this is going to run.\n\n89\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.060\nI'm gonna go ahead and agree, and it looks\nlike that went into the command prompt.\n\n90\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.969\nI'll tell you what,\nlet's try the 64-bit edition,\n\n91\n00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.191\nsome of these are in command prompt and\nI think that's the one.\n\n92\n00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:34.270\nWe'll find the right one.\n\n93\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.660\nThere we go, that's what we want.\n\n94\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.118\nSo, I've got the ability to basically\nperform some different types of crashes.\n\n95\n00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:44.560\nAnd I could do a high level crash.\n\n96\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.620\nAgain, we could do all\ndifferent kinds of things.\n\n97\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.750\nI actually want the Kernel-mode crash.\n\n98\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.050\nThe reason I want the Kernel-mode crash\nis I really wanna see the proprietary\n\n99\n00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.480\nblue screen.\n\n100\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.185\nKeep in mind that they've\nchanged over time, right?\n\n101\n00:04:56.185 --> 00:05:00.225\nThe blue screens used to be just\na blue screen and that was it.\n\n102\n00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:04.995\nToday, you might see a little, in fact,\nlet me just go ahead and show you.\n\n103\n00:05:04.995 --> 00:05:07.182\nI'll show you what you're gonna see.\n\n104\n00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:11.530\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nshow you what a blue screen might do.\n\n105\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.474\nNow before I do the blue screen,\n\n106\n00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:17.660\nlet me let you know some things\nthat might cause this, right?\n\n107\n00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.904\nIt could have malware,\nnot everything's malware, right?\n\n108\n00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:25.800\nThe blue screen also could be things like\noverheating, if your cpu is overheating.\n\n109\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.180\nThey have thermo temperature sensors built\ninto the die of the chip itself that says,\n\n110\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.650\nI've seen a core temperature of\nthe CPU is rising to the threshold and\n\n111\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.260\nit shuts the machine down.\n\n112\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.040\nSometimes it blue screens.\n\n113\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.439\nOther things that can happen are for\ninstance, memory errors.\n\n114\n00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.177\nWell not memory errors but,\nwell memory errors could be it but\n\n115\n00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.320\nit could be failing memory.\n\n116\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.190\nMemory is a nightmare to troubleshoot\nbecause remember we talked about random\n\n117\n00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.250\naccess memory, it's not sequential, it's\nnot called SAMS sequential access memory.\n\n118\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.800\nIt's called random access memory and that\nmeans any point of the memory modules can\n\n119\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.570\nbe randomly accessed just as\nfast as any other points.\n\n120\n00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.960\nSo you have logical addresses\nwhich is our addresses that\n\n121\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.970\nliterally map to physical\nlocations within RAM.\n\n122\n00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.050\nAnd because they can be randomly accessed,\nif a location on one of those\n\n123\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.674\nmemory modules is failing, it's maybe\nnot until you actually try to send data,\n\n124\n00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:21.615\nwrite data, read data, if you will, from\nthat location that it causes the problem.\n\n125\n00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:25.535\nAnd it doesn't manifest itself until\nit's just that one specific location\n\n126\n00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:29.764\nthat's being used, and that can cause\nthings like blue screens, right?\n\n127\n00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.730\nHard drive failing.\n\n128\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.811\nIf you get file corruption in your hard\ndrive Windows can't protect itself, right?\n\n129\n00:06:36.811 --> 00:06:40.230\nIt's got Windows file protection\nis what it used to be called.\n\n130\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.400\nWe have the luxury of every one in\na while we have one of the major software\n\n131\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.660\nproject managers from Microsoft come in.\n\n132\n00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.700\nGotta give shout out to Mike\nout there in the chatroom,\n\n133\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.910\nsays it was renamed to\nsystem file protection.\n\n134\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.270\nIt used to be WFP, now today it's SFP.\n\n135\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.020\nWindows knows how to keep its\nsystem files protected so\n\n136\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.800\nthat we don't have issues like this.\n\n137\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.210\nSo those are some of the issues and some\nof the scenarios that you might come into.\n\n138\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.270\nLet's go ahead.\n\n139\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.064\nI tell you what,\nI've talked to you long enough.\n\n140\n00:07:05.064 --> 00:07:06.571\nLet's see what the blue\nscreen does look like.\n\n141\n00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:09.868\nI'll go ahead, and\nagain that software that we have here.\n\n142\n00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:11.355\nI'm gonna go ahead and run the crash.\n\n143\n00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:14.440\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's see what is going on.\n\n144\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.960\nNotice that it says we're\ncollecting some information,\n\n145\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.470\nwe'll restart when this is complete.\n\n146\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.610\nYou'll see it's going through about 50%.\n\n147\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.470\nAnd then at the bottom there,\nyou'll see what was known as driver.\n\n148\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.770\nAnd I'm gonna do this one more time.\n\n149\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.920\nI'll show you how you can actually\ncollect that information.\n\n150\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.560\nBecause in an area where\nyou're troubleshooting\n\n151\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.230\nif you can't gain access to that screen,\nyou can't see what's going on.\n\n152\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.770\nWell, you wouldn't know what to\ndo to trouble shoot it, right?\n\n153\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.880\nAnd this could happen in\nthe middle of the night and\n\n154\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.090\nyou're not even aware of what's going on.\n\n155\n00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.550\nSo how can we get around that?\n\n156\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.630\nOne of the things that you can do and\nshould always do is check event viewer.\n\n157\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.077\nSo let me go ahead,\ntype our super secret password here.\n\n158\n00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:54.326\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n159\n00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:55.031\nNow that you know,\nI'll change the password on my luggage.\n\n160\n00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:59.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's right-click and we could choose\n\n161\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.480\nEvent Viewer here, but I'm gonna go\nahead and choose Computer Management.\n\n162\n00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.590\nRemember, as I have said\nthroughout this series and\n\n163\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.940\nthe full series that we have,\nI want you to use Computer Management.\n\n164\n00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.870\nCuz it also has event viewer but it's got\na lot of other goodies wrapped into it.\n\n165\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.580\nAnd if we expand this out we\ngo into system logs right?\n\n166\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.390\nOr Windows Logs, excuse me.\n\n167\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.230\nWe can go into System here right,\nremember Application,\n\n168\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.420\napplication level events that\ncause problems, the system itself.\n\n169\n00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.410\nNow I don't know if application,\nthat application that caused the problem\n\n170\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.850\nis necessarily going to generate a log,\nright?\n\n171\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.450\nI mean I can look here, and\n\n172\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.450\nwe could see if there are any logs when\nit comes to Application logs, right?\n\n173\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.450\nBut see I don't see anything, right?\n\n174\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.285\nI see the fact that it's\ngetting close to time for\n\n175\n00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:49.030\nme to activate this operating system.\n\n176\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.555\nCuz that application was working\nexactly the way it was supposed.\n\n177\n00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:54.285\nThat's what it was made to do, right?\n\n178\n00:08:54.285 --> 00:08:56.555\nSo you have to do a little\ndetective work here, right?\n\n179\n00:08:58.175 --> 00:09:03.215\nSo I go to System and I look for issues\nthat might have just happened, right?\n\n180\n00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:07.070\nWell I see a warning here, right and\nit tells me driver failed to load.\n\n181\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:12.070\nWell that is sometimes can happen, notice\nit says driver failed to load the device.\n\n182\n00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.810\nThat's actually a problem that\nwe ought to talk about right?\n\n183\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.360\nThat might not necessarily\ncause the blue screen.\n\n184\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.160\nBut that means you're not gonna\nbe able to use the device.\n\n185\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.930\nThat'll cause the device to\nfail to start at all right?\n\n186\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.460\nAnd it might even cause it to\nfail to actually be detected.\n\n187\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.880\nSo do worry about those,\n\n188\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.030\nbut I'm not really worried\nabout that right now, right?\n\n189\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.740\nWhat I'm worried about\nis this one right here,\n\n190\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.910\nnotice the error, right, just happened.\n\n191\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.460\nAnd it was a BugCheck, what's a BugCheck?\n\n192\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.630\nNow, I'm gonna recreate\nthis blue screen and\n\n193\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.520\nI'll show you in a little bit\nmore depth what this means.\n\n194\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.589\nBut if I just double-click this one error,\n\n195\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.713\nI can see that this computer has\nrebooted from a BugCheck, right?\n\n196\n00:09:56.713 --> 00:10:00.550\nAnd I've got a dump,\nall right, a dump was saved.\n\n197\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.550\nAnd it shows me C:\\Windows\\MEMORYDUMP.\n\n198\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.550\nThe problem with the dump file,\nwhat is the dump file?\n\n199\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.990\nWell, when you have a blue screen,\n\n200\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.210\nwhat happens is Windows captures right\naway all of the information in its raw\n\n201\n00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.480\nformat that was stored in your physical\nmemory and dumps it into a file.\n\n202\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.210\nAnd then that file,\nyou can take to an engineer and\n\n203\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.820\nthey could do the debugging check.\n\n204\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.780\nThis is a BugCheck they can\ndo the debugging on and\n\n205\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.740\nif you ever heard that term.\n\n206\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.735\nProblem for you as a help desk technician,\nmyself, and I have been looking at\n\n207\n00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:36.580\nthese for a while now, is it means\nabsolutely nothing to the average person.\n\n208\n00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.130\nNow, the cool things is out there in\nWindows has Microsoft gave us access to\n\n209\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.140\nthe Diagnostic and Recovery Toolkit, which\nhas something known as the Crash Analyzer.\n\n210\n00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.760\nAnd if you go out and\nget the Windows Software Development Kit.\n\n211\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.830\nAnd you dump the debugging tools\ninside of the Diagnostic and\n\n212\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.610\nRecovery Toolkit and use Crash Analyzer,\nit'll tell you exactly the program and\n\n213\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.800\nthe driver that caused the problem.\n\n214\n00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.100\nSo you can get some information.\n\n215\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.860\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n216\n00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nwhat do I mean by dump check?\n\n217\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.830\nLet me go ahead and show you now.\n\n218\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.040\nIf the blue screen has happened,\nif you think you have a blue screen,\n\n219\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.450\nnotice that that rebooted on me.\n\n220\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.270\nAnd I couldn't get to any information.\n\n221\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.790\nI wanna actually see some information.\n\n222\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.900\nIf you will go to your\nsystem Control Panel.\n\n223\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.620\nNow there's a couple of different ways,\nyou could right click on Windows 8.1.\n\n224\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.275\nLet me show you a way that's consistent\nacross Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,\n\n225\n00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:22.885\nand 8.1.\n\n226\n00:11:22.885 --> 00:11:24.435\nWhy not remember it once,\n\n227\n00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:28.680\nand it works across all four\nversions of the operating system.\n\n228\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.227\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel,\nwe're gonna go to System and Security,\n\n229\n00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:33.478\nwe've been here before.\n\n230\n00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:35.554\nYou guys we're going back again.\n\n231\n00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:40.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna go to System, right?\n\n232\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.220\nThis will be the same thing in\nall four operating systems.\n\n233\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.760\nThis is the system Control Panel,\nAll right.\n\n234\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.480\nAnd what I want more importantly than\nanything else is I want this this little\n\n235\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.710\nhyperlink or jump link here, called\nAdvanced systems settings, all right.\n\n236\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.810\nAnd notice that there is Startup and\nRecovery right here, this is what I want.\n\n237\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:05.030\nAnd notice that it says system failure,\nand debugging information.\n\n238\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.480\nNow if I go over here to Settings and\nI choose Settings,\n\n239\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.560\nyou're gonna notice that this is your\nstartup and recovery location, right?\n\n240\n00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.410\nThis is what I want, but\nnotice this System failure right here.\n\n241\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.190\nAnd notice that it says, write an event\nto the system log, we've seen the event,\n\n242\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.540\nwe've just seen that.\n\n243\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.280\nNotice where it says the Dump file, we've\nseen in the event log where that has.\n\n244\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.590\nAnd this an environment variable, it says\nwherever the system root happens to be C:.\n\n245\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.170\nAll right, so it's saying find the root,\nand dump that file there.\n\n246\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.132\nIn this case, the route is on C:, and\nthat's where the Window's directory is.\n\n247\n00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:44.460\nBut moreso, notice this check mark,\nAutomatically restart.\n\n248\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.031\nThat's why it rebooted, Zach.\n\n249\n00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.800\nThat's why we couldn't stop and\nsee that information.\n\n250\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.750\nSo if I uncheck this, and\nI go down here, and I say,\n\n251\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.890\nokay, and then I don't have to Apply.\n\n252\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:02.010\nBy the way, if I haven't told you before,\nthe difference between OK and Apply.\n\n253\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.180\nApply applies the settings,\nI know that's redundant.\n\n254\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.010\nApplies the settings, all right?\n\n255\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.720\nBut it keeps this dialog box open.\n\n256\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.360\nOK does the same thing, it applies\nthe settings, but when I'm done with it,\n\n257\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.190\nit just closes the dialog box.\n\n258\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.850\nSo they're one and the same, all right.\n\n259\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.490\nNow, let's go ahead and let's rerun that,\nand let's see what goes on, all right.\n\n260\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.950\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna rerun notmyfault.\n\n261\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.400\nAgain, keep in mind ladies and gentlemen,\nyou guys and gals can get this free,\n\n262\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.930\nit's a free utility and it's great\nto see this kind of information.\n\n263\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.150\n&gt;&gt; It's great for labs.\n\n264\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.940\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and\nit lets us kinda see some of the logs.\n\n265\n00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:46.110\nAnd some of the things that you would be\nconfronted with in your own help desk.\n\n266\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.060\nI'm gonna do a high level IRQ, right?\n\n267\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.820\nThat's our interrupt request line.\n\n268\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.720\nWhat those are is when devices\ncommunicate, they interrupt the CPU,\n\n269\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.110\ncuz the CPU is so lightning fast.\n\n270\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.540\nThat we have to interrupt and\ncall the attention.\n\n271\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.140\nA device says I wanna communicate right?\n\n272\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.660\nAnd drivers are configured to\nallow IRQ's through Plug and\n\n273\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.070\nPlay to communicate with\nthe CPU over that line.\n\n274\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:13.340\nWhat happens is when drivers get\ncorrupted or it's the incorrect driver,\n\n275\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.800\ntwo devices could try to use\nthe same IRQ at the same time.\n\n276\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.360\nYou can only have one device communicating\nover that trace on the motherboard\n\n277\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.280\nwith the CPU.\n\n278\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.540\nAnd if there's a conflict,\nguess what happens?\n\n279\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.080\nIt blue screens, so\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n280\n00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.360\nAnd that's a little bit about the IRQ.\n\n281\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.720\nSo let's go ahead and\nlets show you real quick.\n\n282\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.700\nAll right, Not My Fault,\nit's gonna be my fault, I swear.\n\n283\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.920\nIf not, the camera lies,\nI'll blame it on Zach.\n\n284\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.551\n&gt;&gt; It's your fault.\n\n285\n00:14:38.551 --> 00:14:40.096\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we've got the crash.\n\n286\n00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:42.014\nNow, notice what is happening here,\nall right?\n\n287\n00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:46.320\nWe've got our 2:30 in the afternoon\ncrash after lunch, right?\n\n288\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.980\nAnd notice it says, your PC ran into\na problem and needs to restart.\n\n289\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.250\nWe're just collecting some error\ninformation, that's right.\n\n290\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.910\nRemember, scraping all of\nthat data out of RAM and\n\n291\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.190\ndumping it into a file in\nthe location that we said.\n\n292\n00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.770\nNow my head's kinda covering this up, but\nit's showing me what caused this problem.\n\n293\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.910\nAnd again,\nthis is actually a system file, but\n\n294\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.810\nit's part of the application\nthat is using this.\n\n295\n00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:12.220\nAnd Sysinternals is owned by Microsoft,\nso you're not hurting your computer.\n\n296\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.700\nBut I want you to notice something, and\nagain, my head's kind of covering it up.\n\n297\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.800\nUnderstand that this says driver, and\nin fact, we can move it to the side there.\n\n298\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.970\nThere we go,\nthat makes it a little easier to see.\n\n299\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:27.010\nNotice that we've got\nDRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL to.\n\n300\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.034\nIt's kind of letting you know that\nthere's a memory range in here and\n\n301\n00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:31.777\nthat IRQ is an assignment.\n\n302\n00:15:31.777 --> 00:15:34.770\nAnd it's letting you know that,\nhey, it may or\n\n303\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.500\nmay not be this driver that's\ncausing the problem, right?\n\n304\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.570\nAnd that dump it really doesn't do us much\ngood unless we have some way to debug that\n\n305\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:47.010\ninformation, which is why I mentioned\nsomething like Diagnostic and\n\n306\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.600\nRecovery Toolkit.\n\n307\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.502\nAll right now,\nthis also causes improper shutdowns.\n\n308\n00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:56.708\nNow in order to restart this machine,\nwhat I end up having to do, I actually\n\n309\n00:15:56.708 --> 00:16:02.095\nwould have to, notice that it stopped\nthe The dump, but it didn't restart.\n\n310\n00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:06.760\nNow at this point you'd have to go up and\nI'm gonna actually restart this machine.\n\n311\n00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.960\nAll right, now when you do that, keep in\nmind that's just like pushing power and\n\n312\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.660\ndoing a hard reset, a hard reboot, right?\n\n313\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.010\nBut it makes you aware that\nsomething's gone on, right?\n\n314\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.210\nSometimes and by default, not sometimes,\nall the time until you change the settings\n\n315\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.210\nthat I just showed you, you might not be\naware that your machine is blue screened.\n\n316\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.682\nAnd if you are in a company like I used to\nsupport, we never turned the machines off.\n\n317\n00:16:27.682 --> 00:16:30.960\nThey just went into a low powered state\novernight, so if you come back in\n\n318\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.850\nthe next morning and it looks like this,\nI can't tell that it's rebooted.\n\n319\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.029\nI didn't even know that it was an issue,\nright?\n\n320\n00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:40.634\nSo that is one way and I will tell you\non some of the machines that I support,\n\n321\n00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:43.775\nI actually turn off the automatic\nrecovery cuz I wanna come in and\n\n322\n00:16:43.775 --> 00:16:45.953\nI wanna know when they blue screen, right?\n\n323\n00:16:45.953 --> 00:16:46.520\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n324\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.380\n&gt;&gt; Awareness gives you\na way to be reactive.\n\n325\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.140\nAnd not even reactive,\n\n326\n00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.460\nin some cases it might be proactive\nbecause you might find out, hey,\n\n327\n00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.800\nthere's a little bit of dust machine, it's\nheating up and that's what's happening.\n\n328\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.210\nI wasn't aware of it because it\njust kept blue screening on me.\n\n329\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.880\nAnd Windows recovers,\nit protects itself, right?\n\n330\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.120\nAll right, so that’s some of\nthe things that you could do.\n\n331\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.150\nNow there are other things that you\nhave to worry like boot issues, and\n\n332\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.250\nthere are a slew of things when\nit comes to boot issues, right?\n\n333\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:19.030\nWhen you have failure to boot, one of\nthe things that you might have failure\n\n334\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.840\nto boot could be that your boot order\nisn't configured correctly, all right?\n\n335\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.720\nIt could be the fact that you have, for\ninstance, a corruption in the hard drive\n\n336\n00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.630\nand you might have to get\ninto a repair disk, right?\n\n337\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.270\nWhere you repair the operating system or\nyou repair the installation, all right?\n\n338\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.490\nThere are other things, too, right?\n\n339\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.270\nYou might need to boot to safe mode.\n\n340\n00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.850\nSafe mode essentially is a way that you\ncan load only the basic services and\n\n341\n00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.830\ndrivers that are needed just to\nget the operating system online.\n\n342\n00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.960\nNo more, no less, right?\n\n343\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.070\nIf I go into safe mode, my print\nspooler service isn't running, right?\n\n344\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.160\nBecause in safe mode you're there for\ndiagnostics,\n\n345\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.840\nnot to send a print job to the printer.\n\n346\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.620\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So it says that isn't necessary\n\n347\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.360\nto finish the boot process,\nwe will disable it.\n\n348\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.020\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n349\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.590\nOn my machine here, we're gonna\n\n350\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.190\nuse another utility that'll help you\nto diagnose startup problems, too.\n\n351\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.590\nIt's called MSConfig, or\nsystem configuration utility.\n\n352\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:22.760\nAll right, so let's go ahead, and\nlet's bring up our services console.\n\n353\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.350\nI'm gonna right click on our Windows icon,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n354\n00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.980\nI'm gonna choose Computer Management.\n\n355\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.750\nI think I might have just clicked Disk\nManagement too, but Computer Management.\n\n356\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.570\nAll right, I'm gonna open up Services and\nApplications and\n\n357\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.740\nI'm gonna go to Services, all right?\n\n358\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.210\nIn my Services console if I look for\nthe print spooler just by\n\n359\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.630\nclick the name column here, typing the\nletter P, it alphabetically sorts through.\n\n360\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.640\nNotice that my print spooler\nhere service is running, right?\n\n361\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.750\nI can see right there that\nthe service is it's started, right?\n\n362\n00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.710\nIt's letting me know, hey,\nservice status is running.\n\n363\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.550\nAll right, but\nif I'm having failure to boot.\n\n364\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.170\nIf I'm having boot issues, if I think that\nit's a driver that's causing the problem,\n\n365\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.880\nI don't want unnecessary things running\nif I need to try and figure out\n\n366\n00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.850\nif it's a third party driver or if it's\na service that's causing the problem.\n\n367\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.880\nSo what I can do here is\na couple different things.\n\n368\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.740\nI can go to your administrative tools\nthat we've all ready been to, or\n\n369\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.400\nI can go to the Run line.\n\n370\n00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.160\nAnd I can type, msconfig.\n\n371\n00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.880\nAnd you can do it without\nthe .exe in earlier days,\n\n372\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.000\nyou had to type the extension.\n\n373\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.990\nToday the run line is\nsmart enough to know.\n\n374\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.480\nIt can delineate what you're\ntalking about or what you want.\n\n375\n00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.170\nNotice I have this boot option.\n\n376\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.750\nAnd I could do a diagnostic startup or\n\n377\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.010\nI could use the boot tab which you\ncould also modify the boot as well.\n\n378\n00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:42.670\n&gt;&gt; Nice tab.\n\n379\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n380\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.460\nAnd that makes it kind of easy too for\nremembering on the exam.\n\n381\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.850\nAnd notice safe boot,\ndon't let this confuse you.\n\n382\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.270\nThat is safe mode and it's minimal.\n\n383\n00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.960\nAlternate shell says maybe\nI have a driver issue and\n\n384\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.860\nthat's causing the failure to start up.\n\n385\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.490\nThe driver, remember we talked about\nthe device failing to start or\n\n386\n00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.940\nbe recognized,\ncould be the video driver, right?\n\n387\n00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.180\nAnd if it's causing a problem,\nI don't want the video subsystem loading.\n\n388\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.320\nAlternate shell just says,\nboot into safe mode with a command prompt.\n\n389\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.040\nTake the graphical interface out of it,\nI'll just use the text-based interface.\n\n390\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.670\nDon't worry about Active Directory repair.\n\n391\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.420\nThat's well beyond the scope of this exam.\n\n392\n00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.940\nBut also maybe I need to download\nthat third party driver, maybe it is.\n\n393\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.850\nMaybe it is something like\na video card driver, right?\n\n394\n00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.540\nBut I still want to see\nthe graphical user interface, but\n\n395\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.890\nI need the network adapter initiated\nwhich it's not going to be in minimal.\n\n396\n00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.640\nNetwork adapters aren't required\nto boot your operating system,\n\n397\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.770\nso it's shut down with minimal.\n\n398\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.100\nBut maybe you need to\nconnect down to the Internet.\n\n399\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.820\nMaybe you need to connect to a file server\nwhere that driver stored, and you know\n\n400\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.000\nthat driver's stored, but without the\nnetwork adapter, I can't connect to it.\n\n401\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.158\nAnd I'm gonna have to sneakernet over it\nwith a USB key and download the driver and\n\n402\n00:20:51.158 --> 00:20:52.820\nthen sneakernet back, right?\n\n403\n00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.220\nMaybe that's not feasible.\n\n404\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.920\nWell, you can also initiate\nthe network adapter if you want to.\n\n405\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.330\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do minimal.\n\n406\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.220\nWe'll choose OK.\n\n407\n00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.510\nAnd when we choose OK,\n\n408\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.420\nit's gonna say, you may need to\nrestart to apply these changes.\n\n409\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.410\nWe are gonna restart.\n\n410\n00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.540\nThere's no may about it.\n\n411\n00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.640\nAnd when we restart this machine\nI'll give you kind of a piece of,\n\n412\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.100\nor an apology ahead of time.\n\n413\n00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.725\nIt doesn't load the graphics driver for\nthe machine.\n\n414\n00:21:19.725 --> 00:21:22.825\nIt loads a very generic basic VGA driver.\n\n415\n00:21:22.825 --> 00:21:25.185\nSo it's gonna be a very\nlow resolution mode.\n\n416\n00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:27.515\nSo we're gonna have some matting\nthat's gonna go on here.\n\n417\n00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:30.222\nIt's one of the easiest ways to\ntell that you're in safe mode.\n\n418\n00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:34.817\nBecause you're not loading the 3rd\nparty manufacturer's driver, and\n\n419\n00:21:34.817 --> 00:21:35.527\nyou can see the matting.\n\n420\n00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:37.167\nNotice that it went to the matting there?\n\n421\n00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:38.267\nThat's a basic driver.\n\n422\n00:21:38.267 --> 00:21:39.947\n&gt;&gt; And didn't back in the day\nwhen you were in safe mode,\n\n423\n00:21:39.947 --> 00:21:43.117\nall you pretty much got was a black\nscreen and some DOS, right?\n\n424\n00:21:43.117 --> 00:21:44.547\n&gt;&gt; That was the command prompt.\n\n425\n00:21:44.547 --> 00:21:50.483\nNow see yeah, that's the booting into\nsafe mode with the alternate shell.\n\n426\n00:21:50.483 --> 00:21:54.530\nIt would just be the command prompt, which\nmany people still call DOS prompt today.\n\n427\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.600\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll log in to this machine and\n\n428\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.499\nsee if we can tell if\nwe're in safe mode or not.\n\n429\n00:22:01.499 --> 00:22:04.953\nAll right, well,\naccording to the screen here,\n\n430\n00:22:04.953 --> 00:22:08.760\nit let's us know that we're in safe mode,\nall right?\n\n431\n00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.900\n&gt;&gt; That's an indicator [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthat's why I wanted to kinda show that.\n\n433\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.471\nSo don't let safe boot and safe mode\nconfuse you, they're one and the same.\n\n434\n00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:18.655\nBut let's go ahead and\nkinda show you what I mean.\n\n435\n00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:21.743\nLet's follow that train of\nthought to completion, and\n\n436\n00:22:21.743 --> 00:22:23.460\ngo back to the command prompt.\n\n437\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.589\nWe're going to go back into Services and\nApplications.\n\n438\n00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.770\nExpand that out, I'll go to Services.\n\n439\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.160\nAnd, again, all I'm doing is\npressing the name column header and\n\n440\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.920\ntyping the letter P.\n\n441\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.930\nAnd I should look for\nPrint Spooler, right?\n\n442\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.920\nNotice that before it said running, the\nstatus, and it isn't running right now.\n\n443\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.820\nAnd I can see that if I scroll down here,\nservice status it has stopped, right?\n\n444\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.840\nThat's what we mean when you\nsay you boot into safe mode and\n\n445\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.390\nwhy you would boot into safe mode.\n\n446\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.310\nBecause you might be having a driver\nthat's causing the problem and\n\n447\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.120\nwhat you need to do is,\nyou need to uninstall it, right?\n\n448\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.875\nso if I needed to uninstall the driver\nat this point, I could turn around and\n\n449\n00:23:00.875 --> 00:23:03.325\nI could come into device manager.\n\n450\n00:23:03.325 --> 00:23:07.520\nNotice how it says Monitors,\nGeneric Non-PnP Monitor.\n\n451\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.805\nStatus not available for this device\nwhen Windows is running in safe mode.\n\n452\n00:23:11.805 --> 00:23:15.870\nSo what Windows has done is it's\ngone into its basic drivers or\n\n453\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.930\ninto its driver store that's built\ninto the operating system and\n\n454\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:23.410\nsays, where's that basic driver, just\nto give you the graphic user interface.\n\n455\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.290\nOkay, I see it here let's go ahead and\nload that up but we're going to ignore,\n\n456\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:31.750\nthe manufacturer's specific video driver\nthat's for your video card, right?\n\n457\n00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.570\nSo this gets you into this mode and\nit eliminates\n\n458\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.370\nthe potential that it could be the video\ndriver causing the problem there.\n\n459\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.060\nAnd I only pick on video drivers\nbecause they've been known in the past\n\n460\n00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.430\nto cause issues.\n\n461\n00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.370\nAnd you can see not every\nthing is loaded up, right?\n\n462\n00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.100\nWe've got some sensors in\nhere that it said, hey,\n\n463\n00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.280\nthat wasn't required to\nload the operating system.\n\n464\n00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.789\nSo I didn't put the driver into place,\nright?\n\n465\n00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:57.723\nSo again, I could come in here and\nI could find out, hey,\n\n466\n00:23:57.723 --> 00:24:00.245\nwhat is the device that's\ncausing the problem.\n\n467\n00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:05.036\nIf it happened to be like the,\nand I can't do it to that.\n\n468\n00:24:05.036 --> 00:24:06.619\nLet me find something a little bit better.\n\n469\n00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:07.959\nThere's Display adapters.\n\n470\n00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:09.830\nThere we go.\nI'll right-click on that.\n\n471\n00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.490\nAnd I'm kinda just talking\nout loud without showing you.\n\n472\n00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.000\nAgain, kinda taking it for granted.\n\n473\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.170\nI expand the column out.\n\n474\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.930\nI right-click on the device.\n\n475\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.234\nI choose Properties.\nNotice that we have the Driver tab here\n\n476\n00:24:21.234 --> 00:24:27.070\nand from here, I can find things like\nthe details of the driver, right?\n\n477\n00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.870\nI could find out what version of\nthe driver, or I could find out hey,\n\n478\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.060\ndo I have an updated driver.\n\n479\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.066\nI could update the driver if I wanted.\n\n480\n00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:37.971\nIf I had just recently installed\na driver and it's caused a problem,\n\n481\n00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:40.474\nI could roll it back to\nthe previous driver.\n\n482\n00:24:40.474 --> 00:24:43.073\nI could disable the device\nwhich just turns it off,\n\n483\n00:24:43.073 --> 00:24:45.564\nit says don't let Windows\ncommunicate with it.\n\n484\n00:24:45.564 --> 00:24:47.234\nOr I could uninstall it.\n\n485\n00:24:47.234 --> 00:24:50.355\nNow understand, when we're talking\nabout uninstalling a driver,\n\n486\n00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:54.230\nyou're not taking about physically taking\nthe device off the motherboard, you're\n\n487\n00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.940\nsaying take the driver and uninstall\nit Take the driver and throw it away.\n\n488\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.860\nThe driver is what allows the operating\nsystem to see the device and\n\n489\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.270\ncommunicate with it, right?\n\n490\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.632\nIf it fails to start or be recognized,\n\n491\n00:25:04.632 --> 00:25:06.511\nthat's because the driver's missing or\ncorrupt.\n\n492\n00:25:06.511 --> 00:25:08.969\n&gt;&gt; And there's no recovery after\nyou uninstall it, it's gone?\n\n493\n00:25:08.969 --> 00:25:10.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is gone, right?\n\n494\n00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.450\nThe only exception to that are some\nof the plug and play drivers, right,\n\n495\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.780\nbecause they're already\nbuilt into Windows.\n\n496\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.960\nWhen you restart your computer, plug and\nplay will do what it's supposed to.\n\n497\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.630\nAnd Windows will say,\nI detect a new hardware.\n\n498\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.300\nLet me go ahead and reinstall the driver.\n\n499\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.330\nSo that's the time.\n\n500\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:31.910\nBut if it's a third-party manufactured\ndriver, it will not be reinstalled, right?\n\n501\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now there are other things that could\n\n502\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.250\ncause this problem.\n\n503\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.640\nYou could have things like, for instance,\nmissing boot configuration data.\n\n504\n00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.734\nMissing boot configuration data a lot of\ntimes is trouble with the boot files,\n\n505\n00:25:44.734 --> 00:25:45.390\nright?\n\n506\n00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.960\nThis is where things like the boot\nrecovery environment come in,\n\n507\n00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.420\nsystem repair options.\n\n508\n00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.420\nYou can go into a repair disk or\na pre-installation environment.\n\n509\n00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:00.570\nBoot up your command prompt and\nyou can run bootrec.exe,\n\n510\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.640\nand it will allow you to fix the boot\nrecord, fix the boot volume if you will.\n\n511\n00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.360\nSo great things to have.\n\n512\n00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.760\nAgain, if the graphical user\ninterface fails to load,\n\n513\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.380\ncould be a device driver, right?\n\n514\n00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.990\nBecause the graphical user interface,\n\n515\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.030\nthe GUI,\nis powered by the video adapter itself.\n\n516\n00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.970\nThat could cause problems too.\n\n517\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.825\nLet's see, some of the other thing\nthat we might have, missing DLL.\n\n518\n00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:23.309\nOne very hard for me.\n\n519\n00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:24.800\nI can't even recreate this.\n\n520\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.210\nI've tried to recreate this problem.\n\n521\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.930\nI used to have this problem in\nearlier days inside a Windows\n\n522\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:30.717\n&gt;&gt; The olden days.\n\n523\n00:26:30.717 --> 00:26:33.260\n&gt;&gt; When you would uninstall\nan application and\n\n524\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.452\nit would uninstall a common dynamic\nlink library file that was maybe even\n\n525\n00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:41.300\nalready there before you ever\ninstalled that application.\n\n526\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.370\nBut it seen it as one that it needed so\nit thought it was its own DLL and when\n\n527\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.940\nit removed it, now another application\nwhen you launch it says missing DLL file.\n\n528\n00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.070\nAgain, those are very hard\ntoday to kinda even recreate.\n\n529\n00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.350\nIf a service fails to start, just like I\nshowed you the service is consoled, right?\n\n530\n00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.360\nGet in there and figure out, in fact,\n\n531\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.280\nlet me show you cuz there's more\nthan just what I said there.\n\n532\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.440\nOf service is not starting\nbecause you're in safe mode.\n\n533\n00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.190\nThat's a situation in which you've\ncreated that situation or that scenario.\n\n534\n00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:18.470\nBut in computer management, always keep\nin mind that you could come in here and\n\n535\n00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.930\nlike I disabled the prince pooler service,\nright?\n\n536\n00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.476\nWell, somebody could and\nmight potentially disable other services.\n\n537\n00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.486\nAnd you got to be careful with this,\n\n538\n00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:29.880\nbecause services have what\nare known as dependencies.\n\n539\n00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.840\nLet me see if the DHCP\nclient has a dependency.\n\n540\n00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.700\nSome of these, yeah, okay.\n\n541\n00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.350\nSo notice that if I go to the Dependencies\ntab on this service, right,\n\n542\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.270\nit says, this service depends\non the following components, and\n\n543\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.980\nthen it mentions these components.\n\n544\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.125\nIf I disabled these services,\nDHCP doesn't run,\n\n545\n00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:48.758\nit'll fail,\nthe service will fail to start, right?\n\n546\n00:27:48.758 --> 00:27:49.382\nIt needs these services.\n\n547\n00:27:49.382 --> 00:27:53.257\nSo you got to keep in mind that when you\ndisable services, make sure, go to that\n\n548\n00:27:53.257 --> 00:27:57.314\nDependencies tab, make sure that you're\nnot crippling your operating system or\n\n549\n00:27:57.314 --> 00:28:00.240\nother functionalities of\nthe operating system.\n\n550\n00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.146\nYou think, maybe I'm gonna speed up my\nboot process, I don't need that service.\n\n551\n00:28:03.146 --> 00:28:06.990\nI don't want to boot into safe mode, but\nI don't need it to start up the machine.\n\n552\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.970\nSo you disable one service, right?\n\n553\n00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.440\nWell, in what you thought was\noptimization actually is kinda\n\n554\n00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.740\ncrippling the functionality and\ncausing problems.\n\n555\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.210\nCompatibility errors, the great\nthing about compatibility errors,\n\n556\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.420\nanytime you have a compatibility error in\nyour operating system, if you find that\n\n557\n00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.770\nyou do have compatibility errors, right\nclick on the application that you have.\n\n558\n00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.110\nAnd typically what you'll\nhave is a Compatibility tab.\n\n559\n00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.950\nAnd the compatibility tab\nwill allow you to run\n\n560\n00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.280\nthe program in the context of\nan earlier operating system.\n\n561\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.651\nAnd it's sometimes as far back as\nthe context of running in a Windows 95\n\n562\n00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:46.529\nenvironment, and\nit might help to fix the problem.\n\n563\n00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:54.150\nIf it's slow performance, use your\nnormal optimization techniques, right?\n\n564\n00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.250\nDeleting temporary files, running\ndisk cleanup, running the defrag.exe.\n\n565\n00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.120\n&gt;&gt; Good old defrag.\n\n566\n00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n567\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.810\nRunning system, or SFC,\nthe system file checker.\n\n568\n00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:10.410\nRun things like check disk CHK DSK\nto try to recover and repair files.\n\n569\n00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.790\nNormal system maintenance.\n\n570\n00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:17.650\nIf a file fails to open that could because\nyou've renamed it without the extension.\n\n571\n00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.655\nIf a file also fails to open\ngo into your Control Panel.\n\n572\n00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:25.755\nGo to the Programs &amp; Features section and\nlook at the file association.\n\n573\n00:29:25.755 --> 00:29:28.488\nIf you have a txt that\nisn't opening in Notepad,\n\n574\n00:29:28.488 --> 00:29:32.705\nit might be because of the fact that you\nopened it in a third party software.\n\n575\n00:29:32.705 --> 00:29:36.995\nAnd that third party software gave you\nthis little pop up dialog box that said,\n\n576\n00:29:36.995 --> 00:29:41.294\nhey, now from here on out, do you want\nthis file to be associated with a .txt?\n\n577\n00:29:41.294 --> 00:29:42.835\nAnd you didn't even think about it.\n\n578\n00:29:42.835 --> 00:29:44.940\nYou went, Jiminy, click it, and said OK.\n\n579\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.480\nAnd now Notepad is no\nlonger opening your files.\n\n580\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.650\nThat might be a txt file.\n\n581\n00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.120\nIt's a file association thing and\n\n582\n00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.490\nyou can change that inside\nof the operating system.\n\n583\n00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.470\nSo those are things that\nyou can do as well.\n\n584\n00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.060\nMultiple monitor misalignments and\norientation, just keep in mind\n\n585\n00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.740\nyour display settings and be sure\nto arrange them in the right order.\n\n586\n00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.930\nA couple other things that\nI do want to keep in mind,\n\n587\n00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.520\nyou have regedit, R-E-G-E-D-I-T.\n\n588\n00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.740\nThat's the registry editor, however,\nwhen you're modifying the registry,\n\n589\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.850\nbe very cautious, know what you're doing.\n\n590\n00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.240\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't\nmodify the registry but\n\n591\n00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.330\nyou really need to know what you're doing,\nbecause the registry essentially is\n\n592\n00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.230\na collection of the configurations,\nit's a configuration data base.\n\n593\n00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.880\nAnd that's what Windows uses to\nset your runtime environment.\n\n594\n00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.207\nAnd when you start making\nmodifications to the registry,\n\n595\n00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.736\nyou don't get warnings, all right?\n\n596\n00:30:33.736 --> 00:30:37.096\nYou don't get a, are you sure you\nwanna do this, are you really,\n\n597\n00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:38.703\nreally sure you wanna do this?\n\n598\n00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:39.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n599\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.090\n&gt;&gt; No, you make\n\n600\n00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.587\na modification to the registry,\nit's instantaneous for better or worse and\n\n601\n00:30:43.587 --> 00:30:46.303\nyou can cause some unrecoverable\ndamage to your computer.\n\n602\n00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:48.863\nYou can blue screen it,\nit can cause problems and\n\n603\n00:30:48.863 --> 00:30:52.680\nunfortunately after that happens\nyou really didn't help the problem.\n\n604\n00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.555\nYou might be reinstalling the operating\nsystem or going into a preinstallation\n\n605\n00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:01.410\nenvironment, some of the system\nrecovery options at the worst\n\n606\n00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:06.300\ncase scenario running a repair disk and\ndoing a complete PC refresh or restore.\n\n607\n00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.610\nSo those are some of the things\nthat you can run into.\n\n608\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:14.270\nKeep in mind that sometimes it's just a\nmatter of uninstalling an application and\n\n609\n00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.180\nreinstalling an application,\nor it could be repairing it.\n\n610\n00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.080\nBut pay attention to the scenario\nthat they give you on the exam.\n\n611\n00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.590\nMake sure you look for key words and\n\n612\n00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.110\nknow those utilities and tools that\nwe've mentioned in this episode so\n\n613\n00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.690\nthat you can fix the problems should\nthat PC OS give you a hassle.\n\n614\n00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.310\n&gt;&gt; Awesome advice, great teachings.\n\n615\n00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.180\nThank you very much Wes,\ntroubleshooting PC OS issues.\n\n616\n00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.350\nGreat episode, I loved it.\n\n617\n00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.360\nAnd do you have any last words\nthat you want to add or?\n\n618\n00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.960\n&gt;&gt; Just use your systematic approach.\n\n619\n00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n620\n00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Just like we talked about, Zach,\nin our troubleshooting episodes.\n\n621\n00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.730\nThat same methodical approach, right?\n\n622\n00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.099\nWhat are the symptoms, right?\n\n623\n00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.820\nDon't just treat the symptoms,\ntreat the cause, right?\n\n624\n00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.741\nBecause if I have slow performance, I say\nokay, well, I'm gonna run check disk,\n\n625\n00:32:00.741 --> 00:32:02.149\nI'm gonna run defrag.exe.\n\n626\n00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:05.000\nThat should solve the problem, right?\n\n627\n00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.860\nWell, you might just be\ntreating the symptoms.\n\n628\n00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.214\nIt could be a hard drive that's failing,\n\n629\n00:32:09.214 --> 00:32:10.928\nit could be malware and\nthose are the actual causes.\n\n630\n00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:15.730\nAnd you need to treat the causes or\nthe symptoms are just gonna come back.\n\n631\n00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.490\nSo just be aware of that,\nalways apply that methodical approach and\n\n632\n00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.570\nyou should be doing well.\n\n633\n00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.240\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Wes.\n\n634\n00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.830\nI sense that you had something else\nyou wanted to say, so perfect.\n\n635\n00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:29.100\nSo troubleshooting PC OS issues, and\nthis is inside of Accelerated A+ episodes,\n\n636\n00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.954\nwatch them all.\n\n637\n00:32:29.954 --> 00:32:32.320\nYou'll be very glad that you did.\n\n638\n00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.000\nAnd thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n639\n00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.190\nRemember a good IT Pro is always learning.\n\n640\n00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.960\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n641\n00:32:37.960 -->

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:06.002\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.397\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:11.952\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:16.380\nHello and thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.010\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Accelerated

Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.680\nThank you, Wes, for showing up.\n\n11\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.660\nHey, man, I got to, man,\nit's part of my job.\n\n12\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.341\nGood.\nBut it is great to be here, Zack,\n\n13\n00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.160\nthanks for having me back here.\n\n14\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.632\nThat's right, we're gonna be moving\nthrough our Accelerated A+ track,\n\n15\n00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:38.724\njust like Zach stated.\n\n16\n00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:42.429\nAnd we're gonna be looking at some\ncommon PC security issues and\n\n17\n00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.150\nthat's important, right.\n\n18\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.747\nBecause there are so many different\nsecurity issues that you could get into.\n\n19\n00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.129\nI mean security is its own division and\n\n20\n00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.980\nit's got the umbrella term that branches\nout into so many different things.\n\n21\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.480\nSo we're just gonna talk about some of the\ncommon ones here that you can expect to\n\n22\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.429\nsee on the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.969\nAnd really what some of the common ones\nthat you can expect to see inside of your\n\n24\n00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:04.738\nenvironments.\n\n25\n00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:08.650\nBut remember,\nthe sun never sets on hackers.\n\n26\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.740\nNo.\nThe sun never sets on attackers, right,\n\n27\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.270\nthis is a revolving door.\n\n28\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.220\nRemember security,\nit isn't a destination to be reached but\n\n29\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.010\na journey to only be traveled upon.\n\n30\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.040\nSo it is a never ending thing.\n\n31\n00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.990\nAnd I wish I could take credit for that\nbut there was a security guru one time,\n\n32\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.350\nprobably one of the big guys\nlike Bruce Snyder or Ron Revest,\n\n33\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.115\nsomebody said, Wilfield Diffy, that\nsaid that, I can't take credit for that.\n\n34\n00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:34.526\nSaid, security isn't a destination,\nit's only a journey to be traveled on.\n\n35\n00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:37.178\nWhich essentially means that you\nshow me a secure network and\n\n36\n00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:39.315\nI'll show you one that doesn't exist,\nright.\n\n37\n00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:40.975\nIt's just an ongoing thing.\n\n38\n00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.415\nSo we're gonna look at some\nof the common symptoms.\n\n39\n00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.865\nAnd if you guys are following along,\nmaybe you guys are looking at objectives,\n\n40\n00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.005\nI've kind of broken these\ndown a little bit more and\n\n41\n00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.670\nkind of put them together where\nI think they kind of fit.\n\n42\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.600\nAnd what I mean by that is you'll\nsee that some of these things,\n\n43\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.680\nsome of these common types that they call\nout on the exam are browser based, right,\n\n44\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.450\nmore centric around your web browser.\n\n45\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.830\nSome of them are more email based.\n\n46\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.640\nAnd some of them are just general\nsystem level security issues that you\n\n47\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.310\ncould run into.\n\n48\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.800\nSo I kind of categorized them.\n\n49\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.630\nAnd we'll kind of run through each of\none of these here in this episode.\n\n50\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.510\nSo the very first ones that I've kinda\n\n51\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.255\njumbled together if you\nwill are browser based.\n\n52\n00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:18.990\nMm-hm.\n\n53\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.070\nAnd what I mean by browser based\nare things like pop-ups, right.\n\n54\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.520\nNow the great thing is today in\nyour operating systems, more so\n\n55\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.711\nyour web browsers,\nare the fact that pop-ups really,\n\n56\n00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:35.600\nthey happen a lot of times when\nyou get things like ad-wear.\n\n57\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.790\nThat can definitely cause pop-ups.\n\n58\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.776\nSo keep in mind running things like anti\nad-wear technologies, right, not just\n\n59\n00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:48.310\nnecessarily anti-malware and antivirus,\nwhich we'll talk about those coming up.\n\n60\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.180\nBut they've got ones that specifically,\nthey target ad-wear.\n\n61\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.230\nBut with your pop-ups,\nyou have pop-up blockers.\n\n62\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.970\nAnd it used to be in earlier days, that\nyou would would go get third party, and\n\n63\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.050\nthere are still third party\npop-up blockers out there.\n\n64\n00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.888\nBut the software manufacturers, right,\nthe manufacturers of these web browsers,\n\n65\n00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:09.122\nknows that there was such a likelihood\nthat somebody was gonna get a pop-up\n\n66\n00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:13.717\nblocker and they were gonna go to some\nkind of a third-party utility to install.\n\n67\n00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:15.209\nAnd it attaches to the browser and\n\n68\n00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.160\nruns, that they started to build\nthem into the browsers as well.\n\n69\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.280\nChrome does this, Safari does this,\nInternet Explorer does this.\n\n70\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.420\nNow we're talking PC, understand,\nso you might be saying,\n\n71\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.810\nwell you mentioned Safari, that's on Mac.\n\n72\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.230\nWell it's still a browser,\nright, it doesn't matter, and\n\n73\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.830\nit's still something that\nyou might want to run.\n\n74\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.900\nSo even though some of these\nare more specific to PC,\n\n75\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.220\nI'm still gonna mention some things too\nthat really just kinda transcend which\n\n76\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.320\noperating system you're running or\nwhat platform you're running.\n\n77\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.871\nSo pop-ups,\none of the great things that you have, and\n\n78\n00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:46.622\nlet me kinda show you what I mean here.\n\n79\n00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:52.590\nSee I've got Internet Explorer opened here\nand we're up on our ITProTV site, right.\n\n80\n00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.980\nAnd if I go up to the upper\nright hand corner and\n\n81\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.615\nI look at Internet Explorer, you'll see\nthat there's this Tools option, right.\n\n82\n00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.873\nAnd if I go to Tools,\nwe have a few things built in,\n\n83\n00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:06.059\na few options that we can look at.\n\n84\n00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.255\nThe one that I really want is\nInternet Options here, and\n\n85\n00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:12.660\nif I go to Internet Options,\nwell, you will see them here.\n\n86\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.380\nKeep in mind that we've showed in other\nepisodes that Internet Options can also be\n\n87\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.470\nlaunched from the Control Panel as well.\n\n88\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.210\nThis is one common way to get to it,\nall right.\n\n89\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.820\nAnd if I go to the Privacy tab here\nacross the top, I would recommend for\n\n90\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.420\nyour exam knowing at least these\nfirst three tabs that you see.\n\n91\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.100\nGeneral here, just some of the general\nthings that you can do, right.\n\n92\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.130\nIf Privacy is important to you,\n\n93\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.940\nthen you can do things like deleting\nyour browser history, if you will,\n\n94\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.120\nthings like cookie data, again,\nwebsite information, passwords, right.\n\n95\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.410\nThat could lead to security\nvulnerabilities if you will.\n\n96\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.670\nBut more so than that,\nafter you've got these memorized,\n\n97\n00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.150\nI would know the security zones too,\nthis is how we trust web sites or not.\n\n98\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.490\nAnd based on that level of trust it says,\nokay,\n\n99\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.460\ncan things like third-party\nextensions run?\n\n100\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.210\nCan ActiveX controls run?\n\n101\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.120\nIf they can, do they have to be signed\nwith a digital signature, right?\n\n102\n00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.120\nWe want to make sure that we can\nvalidate digital signatures.\n\n103\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.060\nAnd that does require the digital\ncertificate to be trusted.\n\n104\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.080\nUsually goes back up to a root trust,\na root certificate authority if you will.\n\n105\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.920\nWe'll look at that coming up\na little bit too because those can\n\n106\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.737\ncause problems, right.\n\n107\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.750\nSo the different Internet zones you have\nthere are really based on the level of\n\n108\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.830\ntrust.\n\n109\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.990\nEverything is pretty much\nin the Internet zone and\n\n110\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.330\nyou can see that the security\nlevel here is medium high.\n\n111\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.830\nAnd it says appropriate for most websites,\n\n112\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.040\nright, unsigned ActiveX controls\nwill not be downloaded.\n\n113\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.820\nMeans we can't verify where they came\nfrom, right, there's no verification.\n\n114\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.540\nYou don't get that non-repudiation.\n\n115\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.540\nI don't know where it came from,\n\n116\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.240\nchances are I don't want\nit running on my computer.\n\n117\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.150\nHowever, you do have the local\nintranet site, intranet, not Internet.\n\n118\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.060\nIntranet, which means that\nit's on your local network and\n\n119\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.925\nit's your company's web server, right.\n\n120\n00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:06.530\nThat you're connecting not\nnecessarily over the Internet,\n\n121\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.350\nbut internally in your\nown LAN environment too.\n\n122\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.440\nAnd you can see that this is medium low,\nright.\n\n123\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.570\nNotice that it says it's\nthe same as the medium level,\n\n124\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.080\nright, except it doesn't prompt you,\nright.\n\n125\n00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.690\nIf I was to set this slider,\ncustomize it, and set it up to medium.\n\n126\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.600\nNotice it says prompts before\ndownloading potentially unsafe content,\n\n127\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.630\nunsigned ActiveX controls\nwill not be downloaded.\n\n128\n00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.520\nI could customize this if I want.\n\n129\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.890\nBut I can turn it down, right, and\nnow it just says it's the same as medium,\n\n130\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.680\nit just doesn't give you the prompts.\n\n131\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.007\nRight.\nAll right, so once you know that,\n\n132\n00:06:40.007 --> 00:06:42.170\nback to the pop-up blocker here.\n\n133\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.305\nNotice that I said that pop-up\nblockers are a lot of times\n\n134\n00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.270\nare built into the web browsers today.\n\n135\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.250\nYes.\nThis does have it built in.\n\n136\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.260\nAnd maybe there's a pop-up\nthat you need to see.\n\n137\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.030\nSometimes it can get a little restrictive,\nyou can get what's known as a,\n\n138\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.050\nwhat do they call that, a false positive.\n\n139\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.501\nAll right, a false positive means that\nit's identified as a malicious pop-up or\n\n140\n00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:03.040\na pop-up that you don't want to see and\nit blocks it, right.\n\n141\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.970\nWell maybe you're on a web site, I've had\nto do this in the past where we've worked\n\n142\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.370\nfor, or we've come in and we've supported\nsome students that were actually taking\n\n143\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.620\ntraining and they worked at\na government facility if you will.\n\n144\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.260\nAnd they had a government website\nthat they needed to go to and\n\n145\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.390\nthey needed to allow pop-ups to happen.\n\n146\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.290\nWell the problem was based on our security\nsettings that were being pushed out to\n\n147\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.420\nthese computers, they couldn't see those\nadditional dialog boxes, right Zach.\n\n148\n00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.760\nThey were being disabled and\nthey needed to see them.\n\n149\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.450\nSo let me show you here.\n\n150\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.520\nYou wanted to change that,\nwe could always go to Settings here, and\n\n151\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.950\nwhat this allows me to do\nis put in URLs just like I\n\n152\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.690\ncould put in those security zones\nthat we were seeing earlier.\n\n153\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.490\nYou can customize it and\nI could say, hey, I trust this site.\n\n154\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.570\nI wanna put it in the trusted site zone,\nright.\n\n155\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.630\nI want unsigned ActiveX controls to\nbe run because I know the company.\n\n156\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.781\nWell you could also say, hey, I want to\nput in something like www.itpro.tv and\n\n157\n00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:56.126\nI want to allow it to run, right, and\n\n158\n00:07:56.126 --> 00:08:00.329\nI want to make sure that I don't\nhave any problems with pop-ups.\n\n159\n00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:02.634\nI add that and\nnow when I visit that website,\n\n160\n00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:05.578\nit's going to allow those\npop-ups to happen, right.\n\n161\n00:08:05.578 --> 00:08:08.489\nSo again,\nif you're supporting an end user or\n\n162\n00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:12.010\nmaybe a group of people that\nneed to visit this website.\n\n163\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.040\nMaybe you're doing training like I used to\ndo or support the training like I've also\n\n164\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.280\ndone too,\nthis would be something that you can do.\n\n165\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.830\nSo keep in mind that while pop up blockers\nare absolutely a wonderful thing,\n\n166\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:27.530\nsometimes they can be a little problematic\nin a way that maybe you didn't think.\n\n167\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.920\nA browser redirections\nthese can happen until now,\n\n168\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.191\nbrowser redirection a lot of\ntime are highjacks that happen.\n\n169\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.000\nWe talked it in our security episodes\nabout things like for instance ransomware\n\n170\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.820\nand more importantly things like rogue\nantivirus and rogue antivirus has a recap.\n\n171\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.250\nRemember, that's when you get this, what\nlooks to be in any virus software that's\n\n172\n00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.760\nrunning on your computer and\nit says you have a gazillion viruses.\n\n173\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.745\nAnd they would love to take them\noff as long as you pay them money.\n\n174\n00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:00.505\nAnd then when you go to launch\nup your web browser Zach,\n\n175\n00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:03.535\nit just redirects you right to their\nsite and you never typed in their site.\n\n176\n00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.025\nThat is correct and it's annoying.\n\n177\n00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:06.165\nThat has happened before right?\n\n178\n00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:07.105\nI've had to support this.\n\n179\n00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.505\nThat's a browser redirect and\nwhat happens is, and\n\n180\n00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:12.005\nlet me kind of show you here\nback on the General tab.\n\n181\n00:09:12.005 --> 00:09:14.925\nThis is one of the things I would look,\nthat's why I say it's important to\n\n182\n00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:17.815\nunderstand this General tab even\nfrom a security perspective and\n\n183\n00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:24.400\nnot only deleting the history as well, but\nyou might see that you come in here and\n\n184\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.338\nall of a sudden there's this site that\nsays www.you something like this.\n\n185\n00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:34.095\n[LAUGH]\nI don't think\n\n186\n00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:35.900\nit's gonna be that obvious, right?\n\n187\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.684\nBut you see something like this and\nyou're like wait a second here.\n\n188\n00:09:40.684 --> 00:09:42.409\nThat's not my homepage.\n\n189\n00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:48.574\nWell you could do something like for\ninstance, lemme see here,\n\n190\n00:09:48.574 --> 00:09:54.411\nyou could change back to\nwhatever your homepage is, right.\n\n191\n00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:57.392\nAnd then once I do that,\nit gives me the ability to go ahead and\n\n192\n00:09:57.392 --> 00:09:58.570\napply those settings.\n\n193\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.060\nNow I will tell you that sometimes,\n\n194\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.550\nit is so bad that it gets into the system\nand let's say I've downloaded Chrome.\n\n195\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.140\nI love Chrome, i use Chrome all the time.\n\n196\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.470\nIt's one of my preferred browsers.\n\n197\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.040\nBut let's say for\nwhatever reason, again, Google's\n\n198\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.500\nreally good at the security within Chrome,\nbut let's say tha tit does get attacked.\n\n199\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.880\nAnd it keeps going to\nthe homepage that you don't want.\n\n200\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.908\nWell then you might have\nto do something like this.\n\n201\n00:10:21.908 --> 00:10:27.325\nYou might have to go as far as\ngoing into your Control Panel and\n\n202\n00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:32.119\nfrom the Control Panel you\nwould go to your Programs.\n\n203\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.060\nAnd Programs and Features and then\ninside here you might have to grab that,\n\n204\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.710\nlet's say that,\nwhatever that piece of software is and\n\n205\n00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.750\nyou might end up to actually uninstall\nit and reinstall it, that happens too.\n\n206\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.210\nIf it happens to be something like for\ninstance Internet Explorer here,\n\n207\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.300\nyou can go to the Advanced tab and\none of the things that I like to do is\n\n208\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.510\nyou notice this option here, Reset\nInternet Explorer settings, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.760\nAnd if I choose Reset here,\nand I'll go ahead and do this,\n\n210\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.460\nI'm not gonna actually complete it.\n\n211\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.640\nBut notice that that is says the resets\nincludes disabling toolbars and add-ons.\n\n212\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.260\nThat's a big one just in case\nit's maliciously been happening.\n\n213\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.390\nThe default web browser settings.\n\n214\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.450\nSo by default it will take you back\nto your home page being msn.com and\n\n215\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.220\nthen you can change it from there, right?\n\n216\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.970\nTab browser settings, privacy, security\nsettings if you happen to hose them up,\n\n217\n00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.630\nthere's been times where\nI've hosed them up.\n\n218\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.880\nI have been my own worst enemy.\n\n219\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.870\nDeleting personal settings, all of this\ninformation notice is says you must\n\n220\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.130\nrestart your computer for\nthis to take effect.\n\n221\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.700\nBut that's essentially what I used\nto do what's known as a full browser\n\n222\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.190\nreset, all right?\n\n223\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.970\nAnd if you do a full browser reset,\nit's gonna do exactly that.\n\n224\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.320\nAnd sometimes that works.\n\n225\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.290\nAnd I will tell you that\nif you have browser\n\n226\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.540\nredirections that happen sometimes,\nsometimes it'll take over your browser.\n\n227\n00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.870\nAnd you won't be able to gain access\nto the tools and the utilities here.\n\n228\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:59.050\nIf that happens, then and you can't load\nup Internet Explorer, do what I told you.\n\n229\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.030\nGo drop down to your Control Panel.\n\n230\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.420\nGo to Network and Internet and\nnotice that there's Internet Options here.\n\n231\n00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.005\nThe reason I I like using internet\noptions from here because\n\n232\n00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:12.785\nnotice one thing missing\nfrom my screen right now.\n\n233\n00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:14.135\nInternet Explorer is missing.\n\n234\n00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:17.045\nI don't even have to load up\nInternet Explorer if it is so\n\n235\n00:12:17.045 --> 00:12:22.355\nproblematic that it's causing this problem\nthat I can do my advanced reset and\n\n236\n00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:27.855\nyou will notice that same thing is gonna\ncome up, right, same dialogue box and\n\n237\n00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:32.240\nInternet Explorer didn't\neven have to be open.\n\n238\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.770\nIt's good to have those.\n\n239\n00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.770\nYeah.\nIn the background.\n\n240\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.590\nSo that's some of the things that\nyou can come into contact with or\n\n241\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.830\nacross when it comes to browser based.\n\n242\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.675\nNow they call out another thing that I\nwanna say could be browser based but\n\n243\n00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:44.961\nnot necessarily does it\nhave to be browser based.\n\n244\n00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:51.388\nThis could also be a dealing things\nlike applications as well and\n\n245\n00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:59.880\nthat is something known as,\nthey've talked about invalid certificate.\n\n246\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.482\nAnd with invalid certificate, they say\ntrusted root certification authority.\n\n247\n00:13:04.482 --> 00:13:12.190\nWell, this happens when there's fraudulent\ndigital security information, right.\n\n248\n00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.970\nAnd what I mean by that is\nwhen you go to a website.\n\n249\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.580\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and\nlet's go back to my screen here and\n\n250\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:27.050\nnotice that I have this green bar\nright here and it's letting me know\n\n251\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.430\nthat hey, this is ITProTV and\nit's identified by DigiCert.\n\n252\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.470\nWell, that's actually a certificate,\nright?\n\n253\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:39.760\nThat's actually a root CA and let me kinda\nshow you if I view certificate, right,\n\n254\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.090\nI could see the details an I can see that\nthis certificate was issued to us right?\n\n255\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.130\nAnd it's issued by and\nyou can see there's a validation server.\n\n256\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.800\nAnd it's good for\na certain period of time.\n\n257\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.560\nAnd this is this company saying hey, we're\nverifying that that company is who they\n\n258\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.140\nsay they are and there's essentially\nthis route, this path right?\n\n259\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.094\nAnd DigiCert is what's known as\na root certificate authority,\n\n260\n00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.310\nthey're the highest part of the hierarchy.\n\n261\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.870\nWell the problem is,\nif you get a fraudulent certificate.\n\n262\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.900\nLet's say this is my cert, and\nquite literary, maybe it's my certificate.\n\n263\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.999\nOr just blame certs.\n[CROSSTALK] I was the one.\n\n264\n00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:18.280\nOr certs, right?\n\n265\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.570\nWhat's gonna happen is the browser\nisn't going to be green.\n\n266\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.770\nIt's actually gonna be red.\n\n267\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:29.568\nIn fact there's good website out here\ncalled Badass SL, absolutely love this.\n\n268\n00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:31.471\n[LAUGH] Say that slowly please.\n\n269\n00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.076\nYes.\nAnd they are let me show you,\n\n270\n00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:38.227\nthey are a trusted website.\n\n271\n00:14:38.227 --> 00:14:40.380\nThere is nothing wrong with this.\n\n272\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.670\nNotice it says, this connection to\nthe server is encrypted, right?\n\n273\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.080\nSo it's identified, right?\n\n274\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.400\nSo, again this is a legitimate website,\nthere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n275\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.380\nBut I love because they have\nthis untrusted-root, and\n\n276\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.610\nthey show you what you\ncould potentially see.\n\n277\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.330\nAnd they make it so obvious, right?\n\n278\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.580\nThe root says, highjacked root, right?\n\n279\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.050\nSo they, they just want you to see and\nit's good.\n\n280\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.190\nBecause it's good for\ntesting your browsers.\n\n281\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.220\nRight?\nAnd if I clicked on this,\n\n282\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.620\nnotice what's happening here.\n\n283\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:13.230\nIt says There is a problem with this\nwebsite's security certificate, right?\n\n284\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.500\nMore information, right?\n\n285\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.830\nSo I click More information here and\nit says there's certificate errors, again.\n\n286\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.770\nI can see that there are issues with the\ncertificate that's been presented to this\n\n287\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.560\nweb browser so\nI shouldn't be trusting it, right?\n\n288\n00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.660\nWhat I should do is click here\nto continue to the website or\n\n289\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.860\nshould I click here to close the page.\n\n290\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.140\nI should click here to close the page.\n\n291\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.450\nLet me go ahead and say no to that for a\nsecond because I want to show you another\n\n292\n00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.970\nsoftware that will apply this not only to\nthe URLs or the uniform resource locator's\n\n293\n00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.400\nwebsites that you visit, but\nit also applies it to software as well.\n\n294\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.290\nWhere these certificates\nare used to sign software, so\n\n295\n00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:55.600\nwe know where that software came from\nwhen we're gonna go ahead and install it.\n\n296\n00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.803\nAnd that's something known as\nthe SmartScreen Filter, right?\n\n297\n00:15:58.803 --> 00:16:01.543\nLet me see, yep, there we go,\nhere's our SmartScreen Filter.\n\n298\n00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:04.002\nNow I just turned that off just\nto bring it up real quick.\n\n299\n00:16:04.002 --> 00:16:05.001\nI'm gonna turn it back on.\n\n300\n00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.103\nI certainly don't wanna disable this.\n\n301\n00:16:07.103 --> 00:16:10.932\nBut notice that it says SmartScreen Filter\nis designed to warn you if websites you\n\n302\n00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:13.357\nare visiting are impersonating\nother websites and\n\n303\n00:16:13.357 --> 00:16:15.520\ncontains threats to your computer, right?\n\n304\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.040\nSo they're using a reputation database\nrelated to these certificates as well.\n\n305\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.940\nAnd plus, Microsoft maintains,\nnot only Microsoft doesn't maintain\n\n306\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.322\nthe certificates, but they maintain\na list of websites that are known for\n\n307\n00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:32.270\npropagating phishing scams, for\nstealing your privacy information.\n\n308\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.320\nAnd every time you visit a URL,\n\n309\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.860\nlet alone the fact that\nthe certificate isn't trusted,\n\n310\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.480\nit's being checked against that database\nif SmartScreen Filter is turned on.\n\n311\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.760\nAnd if it finds that there is something\nwrong with it, it will warn you.\n\n312\n00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.670\nSo, that's another good thing to happen.\n\n313\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.982\nAnd it also works with applications\nthat you go to install.\n\n314\n00:16:51.982 --> 00:16:54.190\nYeah, in fact, you just answered\nwhat I was going to mention.\n\n315\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.230\nI've been to some websites and\nare starting to go to a website and\n\n316\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:01.180\nit said, this is a known website for\nthis type of activity,\n\n317\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.150\nare you sure you want to go there?\n\n318\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.243\nThat's the warning you were talking about.\n\n319\n00:17:03.243 --> 00:17:05.100\nThat's exactly it, yeah.\n\n320\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.480\nThere's other browsers that\nalso have this technology,\n\n321\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.180\nthis just happens to be something that is\nspecific to Windows that you can see you\n\n322\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.530\ndefinitely want to have turned on.\n\n323\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.900\nNow, not everything is gonna\nbe browser based, right?\n\n324\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.380\nIt could be email based too so\n\n325\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.020\nwe've got a couple of them\nthat you want to be aware of.\n\n326\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.201\nSpam, many people, we don't have to\ngo into a lecture on what spam is,\n\n327\n00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:28.959\nunsolicited email that was received or\nsent from somebody that you don't know.\n\n328\n00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:29.516\nI do like spam though.\n\n329\n00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:31.860\nYeah, [LAUGH] that's right.\n\n330\n00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.605\nSo spam,\nthe best way to deal with spam is to\n\n331\n00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:40.865\nincrease spam filters\non your email clients.\n\n332\n00:17:40.865 --> 00:17:44.375\nYou can have pieces of software\nthat actually run on some of\n\n333\n00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:47.275\nyour networking devices,\nsome of your local host.\n\n334\n00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:47.955\nKeep in mind,\n\n335\n00:17:47.955 --> 00:17:52.925\none of the first lines of defense in spam\nis just don't open unsolicited emails.\n\n336\n00:17:52.925 --> 00:17:55.040\nIf they come from a source\nyou're not aware of,\n\n337\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.730\nI don't care if it's in your inbox, right?\n\n338\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.050\nFlag it as spam if you will.\n\n339\n00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.840\nIf you need to create filters in your\nemail clients that will delete that stuff.\n\n340\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.510\nDon't open it, right?\n\n341\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.101\nOther things that you can see too,\nhijacked email, all right?\n\n342\n00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:11.720\nHijacked email, this happens a lot\nof times with phishing scams, right?\n\n343\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.881\nWhere somebody is again your one and only\nbrother from another mother in a Nigerian\n\n344\n00:18:15.881 --> 00:18:19.378\ncountry that's a prince and\nwants to give you a gazillion dollars and\n\n345\n00:18:19.378 --> 00:18:22.776\nwould love to give you that information\nif you do one of two things.\n\n346\n00:18:22.776 --> 00:18:25.325\nYou give him your banking\naccount information or\n\n347\n00:18:25.325 --> 00:18:28.630\nyour log in to your email so\nthey can verify your email address.\n\n348\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.450\nAnd what you're actually doing is logging\ninto a keylogger that's then just\n\n349\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.170\nreporting your credentials over\nto whatever server's waiting.\n\n350\n00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.890\nAnd now they have access to your email and\nthey start making you the source of spam.\n\n351\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:44.720\nYou gotta be careful because what happens\nif your company, through your misfortune,\n\n352\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.080\nyour misuse, you get hacked and\nthey start using your email to spam,\n\n353\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.500\nyou could end up on what's known\nas a DNS blacklist, the DBL.\n\n354\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.020\nWoo.\n\n355\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.983\nDNS blacklist is when your ISP\nhas seen your source of spam and\n\n356\n00:18:57.983 --> 00:19:02.811\nthey remove you from the public Internet,\nessentially your existence.\n\n357\n00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:03.342\nHoly.\n\n358\n00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:06.570\nSo yeah,\nyou gotta be careful with that one.\n\n359\n00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.000\nAutomated replies from unknown sent email.\n\n360\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.040\nThis could happen.\n\n361\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.710\nYes, it could be something that is\nan automatic reply from an unknown email.\n\n362\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.710\nAgain, you can end up on what's\nknown as a distribution list.\n\n363\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.678\nA lot of times what happens is spammers\nwill get a list of potential addresses\n\n364\n00:19:24.678 --> 00:19:27.469\nthat are just really just a,\nit's an alphanumeric or\n\n365\n00:19:27.469 --> 00:19:31.517\nan alphabetic list with the dictionary\nwords in it that are strung together.\n\n366\n00:19:31.517 --> 00:19:34.486\nAnd they'll send out 10,000, 20,000,\n\n367\n00:19:34.486 --> 00:19:38.111\n100,000 of these hoping that\nyou'll reply to one of them.\n\n368\n00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:42.424\nCuz if they get 10 people out of 100,000\nand each person out of those 10 people\n\n369\n00:19:42.424 --> 00:19:46.550\ngive them money, they've made money just\non sending out an email blast, right?\n\n370\n00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:52.260\nIf you have automatic replies turned on,\nthen, you're like a beacon, right?\n\n371\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.660\nWe talk about the ping utility of\nnetworking, can I reach that machine?\n\n372\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.920\nLike radar, right?\n\n373\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.210\nThink of radar.\n\n374\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.000\nIf I send out a ping, right,\nthe radar system listens for the echo and\n\n375\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.330\nI know that that whatever it\nis in the water right there.\n\n376\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:12.300\nWell, if I send out a 100,000\nemails randomly and one person does\n\n377\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.260\nan automatic reply, I'm like, so\nthere is somebody on the other side of\n\n378\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.280\nthat email and then we can go into\nour other targeted attacks as well.\n\n379\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.150\nSo those are things that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n380\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.252\nNow there are other things too\nthat can be system-based and\n\n381\n00:20:25.252 --> 00:20:28.220\nwhen we talk about system-based,\nslow performance.\n\n382\n00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.327\nNow, be careful on just saying and\nassuming right away, I've had a lot of\n\n383\n00:20:32.327 --> 00:20:36.964\npeople, I've seen a lot of people, users\ndo this, they assumed because they've\n\n384\n00:20:36.964 --> 00:20:40.966\ngot slow performance that it's got\nto be a security issue, all right?\n\n385\n00:20:40.966 --> 00:20:44.222\nNot necessarily, or the other side of\nthe tracks they have slow performance and\n\n386\n00:20:44.222 --> 00:20:46.825\nthey just say this computer is horrible,\nit's slow.\n\n387\n00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:50.285\nNo, it may be slow because the user\nthat is behind the keyboard, right?\n\n388\n00:20:50.285 --> 00:20:51.805\nThat might be the problem.\n\n389\n00:20:51.805 --> 00:20:55.145\nEither way you've got to kind of\nfigure it out, run your anti malware,\n\n390\n00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:57.720\nrun your anti virus scans, find out.\n\n391\n00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.440\nClean up temporary files,\n\n392\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.360\nuse disk defragmenter that we've\nbeen talking about before, right?\n\n393\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.220\nUse your disk clean ups, right?\n\n394\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.740\nCould be Internet connectivity issues,\nright?\n\n395\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.450\nIf it's an Internet connectivity\nissue that's caused by a virus or\n\n396\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.620\ncaused by a malware, here's one\nthing that I would recommend doing.\n\n397\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.340\nBoot in the safe mode with\nthe network adapter turned on.\n\n398\n00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.080\nIn other episodes,\n\n399\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.670\nwe've talked about how you can modify\nthe way you boot into safe mode.\n\n400\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.772\nYou can do it minimalistic, you can do\nit with an alternate shell which is your\n\n401\n00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:29.515\ncommand prompt, or you can initiate\nthe network adapter, right?\n\n402\n00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:34.115\nOne of the great things about booting into\nsafe mode with a network adapter is it's\n\n403\n00:21:34.115 --> 00:21:38.470\nonly gonna load the driver that's needed\nin a small TCP/IP protocol stack.\n\n404\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.080\nIt gets you communicating\nwith the network.\n\n405\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.530\nIt isn't gonna load the virus.\n\n406\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.340\nIt isn't gonna load the files\nthat are surrounding that virus,\n\n407\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.510\njust what you need to communicate.\n\n408\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.610\nIf your network communications\nare restored because of that,\n\n409\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.890\nyou could have a couple of issues, right?\n\n410\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.820\nYou could have a driver issue,\nthat could be the problem,\n\n411\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.740\nit could be a third party\ndriver causing the problem.\n\n412\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.770\nOr it could be malware, right?\n\n413\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.930\nThe great thing about this is if you\nboot into safe mode, a lot of times,\n\n414\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.530\nthose viruses and pieces of malware,\nunless they're rootkits,\n\n415\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.570\ncuz those things are just nasty anyways,\nthey're very hard to get rid of.\n\n416\n00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.680\nWill be sleeping, right,\nwill be sleeping a rattlesnake.\n\n417\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.920\nAnd when I run in safe mode, since I'm\nonly loading the basic drivers and\n\n418\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.920\nthe basic services,\nI can run that antivirus software and\n\n419\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.960\nI can catch that file while it's sleeping,\nwhile it's not actually running,\n\n420\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.040\nwhatever service or executable it might\nbe trying to run in the background.\n\n421\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.700\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n422\n00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.360\nPC lock ups, that could happen,\na PC lock up, now, OS lock up.\n\n423\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.750\nMake sure that isn't somebody trying to do\na guessing attack against your password.\n\n424\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.605\nBecause we've shown things like account\nmanagement where we can do lockout\n\n425\n00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:44.880\nthresholds, where after so many attempts\nof invalid attempts I guess for\n\n426\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.480\nthe password,\nit locks you out of your machine.\n\n427\n00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.750\nThat could be the problem.\n\n428\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:55.600\nIf it happens to be a full PC lock out or\nit's files and stuff that aren't running,\n\n429\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.230\nthat could be as well if a file just\nwon't allow you to run an executable.\n\n430\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.380\nIt could be the fact that\nyou've got ransomware.\n\n431\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.800\nRansomware is known to\nlock up your computer and\n\n432\n00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.670\nkeep your files encrypted until\nyou pay them to decrypt them.\n\n433\n00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.570\nCould be some kind of scareware.\n\n434\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.730\nLike I like to say\nscareware as- Scareware?\n\n435\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.430\nYeah, scareware is one\nlike the FBI warning.\n\n436\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.220\nOr it gives you reduced functionality and\n\n437\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.120\ndoesn't allow you to close the browser\ndown, doesn't allow you to do anything.\n\n438\n00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.040\nYou have to restart your computer.\n\n439\n00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.390\nThese could be issues as well.\n\n440\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.970\nWhat else?\n\n441\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:28.940\nRogue antivirus.\n\n442\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.688\nRogue antivirus, this is typically\nwhere you'll have to go into some kind\n\n443\n00:23:32.688 --> 00:23:35.016\nof pre-installation environment, right?\n\n444\n00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:38.825\nAnd load up a repair disk and\nmaybe even get into the command prompt and\n\n445\n00:23:38.825 --> 00:23:41.200\ndelete that file or those series of files.\n\n446\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.880\nYou might have to do\nan offline antivirus clean.\n\n447\n00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.170\nAnd there's a lot of great ones out there\nwhere you can just basic, Windows Offline,\n\n448\n00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.640\nWindows Defender Offline, WDO,\nWindows Defender Offline.\n\n449\n00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.795\nI had to think about the acronym there.\n\n450\n00:23:55.795 --> 00:23:56.426\nMm-hm.\n\n451\n00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:59.420\nThat's the Windows, in fact, let me\nshow you Windows Defender in general.\n\n452\n00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.748\nCuz we're talking about running antivirus.\n\n453\n00:24:00.748 --> 00:24:02.678\nAs I've been saying that\nI'm looking at a time,\n\n454\n00:24:02.678 --> 00:24:04.241\nI'm like I haven't even run that yet.\n\n455\n00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:05.622\nLet me go ahead and show you.\n\n456\n00:24:05.622 --> 00:24:08.969\nJust know that when I say\nWindows Defender offline,\n\n457\n00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:13.395\nwhat it means is you put it on\na pre-installation environment disk.\n\n458\n00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:15.377\nAnd you run it from RAM and\n\n459\n00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:20.400\nthe operating system isn't even loaded,\nit isn't running.\n\n460\n00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.990\nWhat's happening is essentially it's\nloaded into RAM and it's allowing you to\n\n461\n00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.860\nscour the hard drive without the operating\nsystem being online running.\n\n462\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.140\nThat's the offline and\nit looks exactly like\n\n463\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.530\nthe Windows Defender that you see\nright here, it's no different.\n\n464\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.480\nAll right the only one difference is,\nbecause the disk,\n\n465\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.430\nyou can't write and\nupdate definitions to it.\n\n466\n00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.680\nThe first thing that's gonna happen is\nthat your definitions are probably gonna\n\n467\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.338\nbe out of date,\ncuz they update almost weekly.\n\n468\n00:24:49.338 --> 00:24:52.260\nIt's gonna wanna connect outbound,\npull down the definitions,\n\n469\n00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.530\nload them into RAM so\nthat it can have updated signatures.\n\n470\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:00.650\nBut for the most part, other than that\nit looks exactly the same, right?\n\n471\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.910\nAnd when we run these we can run\nthings like quick scans, full scans,\n\n472\n00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.190\ncustom scans, right?\n\n473\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.380\nIf I do a custom scan,\n\n474\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.761\nessentially what I could do is tell\nWindows Defender here's what I wanna run.\n\n475\n00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:15.430\nIf you think you have a removable drive\nthat maybe you want to run the scan\n\n476\n00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.890\nagainst, you can go ahead and do that.\n\n477\n00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.775\nInteresting thing about the custom scan,\n\n478\n00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:22.823\nI've got a love/hate relationship\nwith this custom scan, right?\n\n479\n00:25:22.823 --> 00:25:26.340\nAnd let me tell you why,\nquick scan does kinda what it says.\n\n480\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.020\nIf you can kinda see it in the background\nthere as that pop up, right?\n\n481\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.600\nWe say hover to discover.\n\n482\n00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.281\nAll you gotta do is hover\nover certain areas, and\n\n483\n00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:33.850\nit'll tell you exactly what it's gonna do.\n\n484\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:34.480\nRight.\n\n485\n00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.650\nCommon areas that you're likely\nto see infections, right?\n\n486\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.360\nWell, it does the custom scan.\n\n487\n00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.810\nStill does a quick scan and\nthe other areas that you pointed to.\n\n488\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.180\nSo you're still doing\na quick scan either way.\n\n489\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.180\nThe reason I say love/hate, I'm just\nkind of picking on it in joking fun.\n\n490\n00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.510\nIf I want to just look at the USB drive,\ndon't do a quick scan,\n\n491\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.250\nI just want to know about this USB drive.\n\n492\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.890\nIf I wanted a quick scan,\nI would have said hey, do a quick scan and\n\n493\n00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.200\nthe USB drive.\n\n494\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.430\nSo I'm just kind of poking fun,\n\n495\n00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.300\nit's still a great utility cuz it's\nbuilt into the operating system.\n\n496\n00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.430\nAre there ones that are out\nthere that are better?\n\n497\n00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.088\nYou betcha, but\nyou have to go with a third party.\n\n498\n00:26:11.088 --> 00:26:14.776\nAnd that's one of the things I like about\nthe Windows operating system is you don't\n\n499\n00:26:14.776 --> 00:26:16.740\nhave to go to a third party for\nsome of these.\n\n500\n00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.480\nYou have things like Windows Defender that\nis built right into your operating system\n\n501\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.250\nand you can use immediately.\n\n502\n00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.623\nAnd that's a no cost utility too, right\n[CROSSTALK] Yes sir, I'm glad you brought,\n\n503\n00:26:25.623 --> 00:26:26.489\nfree, right?\n\n504\n00:26:26.489 --> 00:26:28.453\nThat's the one four letter word that\nwe are not afraid to buy, right?\n\n505\n00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:29.470\nI love that word.\n\n506\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.850\nIf you have Windows 7 you can always\nget Microsoft Security Essentials.\n\n507\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.800\nWhen Windows 8 and 8.1 came out they\nsaid let's take Security Essentials and\n\n508\n00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.940\nWindows Defender and\nwe'll marry the two together and\n\n509\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.930\nwell place them in the operating system.\n\n510\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.440\nSo you no longer have to get\nMicrosoft Security Essentials in\n\n511\n00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.750\nthe newer operating systems.\n\n512\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.910\nVery nice.\n\n513\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.083\nAll right, so we got some other\nthings here just to kind of wrap up.\n\n514\n00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:53.498\nSome of the things,\nyou could get an access denied.\n\n515\n00:26:53.498 --> 00:26:56.727\nIf you get an access denied then you\ncould potentially have a root kit or\n\n516\n00:26:56.727 --> 00:26:59.750\na virus that is making modifications\nto the access control list.\n\n517\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.845\nIf that happens then you're gonna\nwanna run into a recovery environment,\n\n518\n00:27:03.845 --> 00:27:05.676\npreinstallation environment.\n\n519\n00:27:05.676 --> 00:27:08.272\nAnd you might do a refresh\nof your operating system or\n\n520\n00:27:08.272 --> 00:27:10.049\nrestore of your operating system.\n\n521\n00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:12.806\nAgain, when we start talking\nabout modifying system files and\n\n522\n00:27:12.806 --> 00:27:15.800\nstuff like that,\nthat's a pretty hefty thing.\n\n523\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.390\nAgain, renaming system files.\n\n524\n00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.120\nAgain, you could do system restore,\ntake your system restore and\n\n525\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.220\nrestore it to an earlier point in time.\n\n526\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.003\nOr to a snapshot, but you might have to\ndo a refresh or a restore of your PC,\n\n527\n00:27:29.003 --> 00:27:32.803\ndepending on how much data that\nyou want to remain behind.\n\n528\n00:27:32.803 --> 00:27:36.203\nFiles disappearing, one of the things you\ncan do is you can look in Event Viewer,\n\n529\n00:27:36.203 --> 00:27:37.260\nlook at the system logs.\n\n530\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.380\nLogs help out a lot.\n\n531\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.330\nYou can look at the system logs and\n\n532\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:45.540\nsee if there's any telltale sign of what's\ngoing on and why those would be changed.\n\n533\n00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.040\nAgain, per any kinda file permission issue\nyou might wanna get into the recovery\n\n534\n00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.930\nconsole again, or\nagain the system repair options.\n\n535\n00:27:53.930 --> 00:28:00.279\nAnd get in there and\ntry to do basic repairs.\n\n536\n00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:04.485\nLast but not least, let's talk about seven\nsteps that I want you to know when it\n\n537\n00:28:04.485 --> 00:28:08.380\ncomes down to the best practices or\nmalware removal, right?\n\n538\n00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.694\nOne, identify the symptoms,\nthe malware symptoms.\n\n539\n00:28:11.694 --> 00:28:12.830\nYou gotta identify the symptoms.\n\n540\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.420\nRemember, don't just treat the symptoms\ncuz we still have to know what\n\n541\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.000\nthe cause is, right?\n\n542\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.090\nQuarantine the infected system, right?\n\n543\n00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.990\nIf I quarantine the infected system,\nI know have an infected system,\n\n544\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.650\nthe first thing I do is I reach\naround to the back of the computer,\n\n545\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.150\nor maybe the side of the computer,\nand I disconnect it from the network.\n\n546\n00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.059\nIf it happens to be a wireless computer,\n\n547\n00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:33.934\nI disable the wireless network\nadapter right away, right?\n\n548\n00:28:33.934 --> 00:28:37.126\nMm-hm, isolate it.\nThat's called error gapping it, isolation,\n\n549\n00:28:37.126 --> 00:28:39.360\nlove it, absolutely, Zach.\n\n550\n00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.450\nDisable System Restore.\n\n551\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:46.370\nRight, because if we talk about the fact\nthat system files are being renamed.\n\n552\n00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:51.950\nWell, if I create a system restore point\nright now, or it happens automatically,\n\n553\n00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.860\nwhich they do happen automatically in the\nbackground, certain things trigger that.\n\n554\n00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.640\nYou could take that virus or\nthat piece of malware and\n\n555\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.300\nit could be in your system restore.\n\n556\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.030\nSo when you think you're restoring to\nan earlier point in time and a good,\n\n557\n00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.870\nclean slate,\nyou're actually just restoring the virus.\n\n558\n00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.310\nSo disable System Restore.\n\n559\n00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.020\nRemediate the infected system.\n\n560\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.210\nA couple things that you'll have to do\nis update the anti-malware software.\n\n561\n00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:16.710\nDefinitions have to be up to date for\n\n562\n00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.410\nyou to be able to define what a virus is,\nright?\n\n563\n00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.530\nAnd then use your scanner\nremoval techniques.\n\n564\n00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.070\nIt could be safe mode.\n\n565\n00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.980\nCould be an offline environment\nlike a preinstallation environment\n\n566\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.950\nlike the Windows Defender Offline where\nyou load the optical drive in and\n\n567\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.690\nyou boot to that.\n\n568\n00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.340\nYou don't even load the operating system.\n\n569\n00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.940\nThen once that's done,\nmake sure you schedule your scans.\n\n570\n00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.580\nNot only run your scans then but\nschedule your scans, right?\n\n571\n00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.900\nRun your updates, update your\noperating system for security patches.\n\n572\n00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.960\nMaybe you've got a problem because\nyou haven't updated your system.\n\n573\n00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.970\nMake sure you're running\nyour Windows updates, right?\n\n574\n00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.080\nPatch management is important.\n\n575\n00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.825\nThen the next thing to do is go ahead and\nonce that's done,\n\n576\n00:29:56.825 --> 00:29:59.585\nyou've remediated the system,\nenable System Restore.\n\n577\n00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:04.210\nTurn that back on and create your restore\npoint on the nice clean slate, right?\n\n578\n00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:09.590\nThe systems state data is back in a nice,\ngood, pristine configuration.\n\n579\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.190\nSo that if this happens after the fact,\nand it does,\n\n580\n00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.635\nI mean it's not anything that,\nsometimes you can avoid it.\n\n581\n00:30:16.635 --> 00:30:18.620\nSometimes you can implement\npreventative measures, but\n\n582\n00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.310\nsometimes your best effort still\nisn't gonna solve it completely.\n\n583\n00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.490\nSo enable System Restore,\ncreate a system restore point.\n\n584\n00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.740\nLast but not least, educate the end user.\n\n585\n00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:36.490\nRemember, when anything in security,\nthe first line of defense is awareness.\n\n586\n00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.773\nAnd awareness doesn't happen\nwithout educating the user.\n\n587\n00:30:39.773 --> 00:30:41.931\nAnd also keep in mind\ncontinuous communication.\n\n588\n00:30:41.931 --> 00:30:46.060\nThis isn't in the steps, just an extra\none cuz this is a very redundant process,\n\n589\n00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.930\nall right?\n\n590\n00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.910\nEducation breeds awareness and\n\n591\n00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.580\ncommunication keeps that process going,\neducation and communication.\n\n592\n00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.540\nSo it's very, very cyclic,\nit's very redundant.\n\n593\n00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.290\nRemember, it's never\na destination to be reached,\n\n594\n00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.040\nsecurity is only a journey\nto be traveled upon.\n\n595\n00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.820\nFantastic, awesome information.\n\n596\n00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:07.700\nTroubleshooting PC security issues\ninside of the Accelerated A+ series.\n\n597\n00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.440\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n598\n00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.190\nWes does an awesome job, doesn't he?\n\n599\n00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.030\nHe really does.\n\n600\n00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.650\nAnd listen, thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n601\n00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.170\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n602\n00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:17.960\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n603\n00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.820\nAnd I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n604\n00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:27.161\nAnd we will see you again very soon.\n\n605\n00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:30.557\n[MUSIC]\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.075\nWelcome to ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:07.776\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:10.656\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.529\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.130\nhelping you learn whereever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.220\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of accelerated A+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.990\nAnd we're gonna be looking\nat communication and\n\n8\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010\nprofessionalism, as taught to us\nby the one and only Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.559\nWes, good to see you again.\n\n10\n00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.604\n&gt;&gt; Hey, man, thanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:28.575\n&gt;&gt; It's great to be here, yep.\n\n12\n00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely, great to be going\nthrough the accelerated course here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.470\nNow we have been looking at operational\nprocedures in the last few episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.810\nwe're in domain five\nof the 902 objectives.\n\n15\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.890\nAnd this is one of those that I have to\ntell you it might be a little dry, right.\n\n16\n00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.485\nBecause we've talked about\nthings like safety procedures,\n\n17\n00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:50.860\nwe've talked about things like\nenvironmental controls, and\n\n18\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.530\nI know sometimes that stuff seems a lot of\nbureaucracy and paperwork, if you will.\n\n19\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.310\nAnd we've talked about things like\ntroubleshooting methodologies in\n\n20\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.070\nother episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.480\nWell in this one we're gonna be talking\nabout, like Zach says, communication and\n\n22\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.300\nprofessionalism, and a lot of this\nis really just theory, right.\n\n23\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.580\nI don't know about you all, but\nI love getting into the operating systems,\n\n24\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.900\nlooking at the hardware,\nconfiguring networks, right,\n\n25\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.800\nthat's the fun stuff, that's the stuff\nthat we absolutely love doing.\n\n26\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.540\nHowever, there are some other things,\nright,\n\n27\n00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.640\nthere's another side of the coin\nthat we gotta keep in mind.\n\n28\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.360\nBecause if you are going into\nan A+ environment, right,\n\n29\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.710\nyou're gonna get your A+ certification,\nyou're gonna get to a point where you're\n\n30\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.990\ngonna be supporting customers, you're\ngonna be working with other people, and\n\n31\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.810\nyou really have to know some of\nthe basics about communication with them.\n\n32\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.479\nNow this is an interesting\none because this has\n\n33\n00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.039\nactually been in the A+ exam\nobjectives for a very long time,\n\n34\n00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.360\nand it's one that a lot of the major\ncompanies went to people like CompTIA.\n\n35\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.243\nSee CompTIA, their certifications\nfall under what's known as an ISO,\n\n36\n00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:53.892\nit's the International Organization of\nStandardization, and ISO accreditation,\n\n37\n00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:58.622\nit's 17024, don't worry about that number,\nthat's not coming up on the exam.\n\n38\n00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:02.308\nBut what that means is that there\nare nine international standards bodies\n\n39\n00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:05.698\nthat heavily scrutinize this exam for\nindustry-wide standards,\n\n40\n00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:08.678\nthat it's meeting the objectives\nof companies out there.\n\n41\n00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:12.714\nAnd one of the things that companies\nwanted to see is a little bit more focus\n\n42\n00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:14.484\non things like communication.\n\n43\n00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:18.753\nSo it is going to be something that you\nneed to know on the exam, there might be\n\n44\n00:02:18.753 --> 00:02:22.990\nscenarios that they put you in when it\ncomes to communicating with others.\n\n45\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.290\nSo even though this is something that,\nagain it's not really some of the fun\n\n46\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.880\nstuff, understand that it was asked\nby major companies that support and\n\n47\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.750\nendorse CompTIA-type certifications.\n\n48\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.140\nLike Intel, like Microsoft,\nlike things like IBM and Hewlett Packard,\n\n49\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.580\nthese big companies, right,\n\n50\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.940\nthat they wanted to see some of this\ninside of the test itself, the exam.\n\n51\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.480\nAnd it's important to understand that\nyou can be a brilliant technician, and\n\n52\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.440\na lot of the people that are in computing\nthey're really creative in the way that\n\n53\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.550\nthey can come up with problems,\nthey understand all of the jargon, right,\n\n54\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.612\nthey understand the technical lingo, but\n\n55\n00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:06.010\nthen when it comes to communicating with\npeople they kinda lose that side, right.\n\n56\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.050\nI can't remember, what is it,\nleft brain is creativity,\n\n57\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.650\nright brain I think is the one\nthat's more analytical, right.\n\n58\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.960\nAnd in IT,\nbecause you're staring at computers,\n\n59\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.780\nbecause you're trying to solve problems,\nyou use a lot of your right brain\n\n60\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.250\nfunctionality, but\nwe gotta exercise that left brain, right.\n\n61\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.460\nSometimes there is a disconnect, and\nall you have to do is ask my wife and\n\n62\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.964\nshe'll tell you yeah, [LAUGH] there's\ndefinitely a disconnect, right.\n\n63\n00:03:27.964 --> 00:03:30.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So again, it's gonna be more of\n\n64\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.640\ntheory in this one, but\nit is something that you have to know and\n\n65\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.970\nyou definitely want to pay attention\nto this episode and these concepts,\n\n66\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.080\ndon't just overlook them because it\nisn't some of the more fun stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.520\nSo when we dive into communication and\n\n68\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.300\nprofessionalism there are some\nthings that we have to look at.\n\n69\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, proper\nlanguage is where we can start, right?\n\n70\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.760\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, Zach, that's one of\nthe things that is very, very important.\n\n71\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.720\nWe say proper language, okay, so yeah,\n\n72\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.710\nwe're talking about don't get offensive\nwith your language and stuff like that.\n\n73\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.540\nNow, ladies and gentlemen out there,\noutside of a professional environment\n\n74\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.525\nI talk like a sailor, right,\nI could give a sailor a run for\n\n75\n00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:08.830\nits money when it comes to\nthe conversations that I have.\n\n76\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.210\nAnd I say I'm not cursing,\nI'm communicating,\n\n77\n00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.380\nyou're gonna know when I'm cursing,\nright, but\n\n78\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.200\nthe point is that has no business in\na professional environment, right.\n\n79\n00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.590\nIt has no business in a professional\nenvironment with the people that have to\n\n80\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.540\nwork next to you or\nthe people that you're helping support.\n\n81\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.180\nSo there are obvious things when it\ncomes to proper language that we have to\n\n82\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.250\nkeep in mind, right,\nwe keep profanity out of it,\n\n83\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.900\nright, we have to be mindful of\nthe environment that we're working in.\n\n84\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.985\nSo some of the proper language that\nwe also have to keep in mind is that\n\n85\n00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:42.860\nif you're first into A+, all right.\n\n86\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.750\nIf you first get into A+ and Zach and\nI appear, we start talking about hey,\n\n87\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.240\nyou need that SATA drive, it needs to plug\nin with this cable to the mobo, right, and\n\n88\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.802\nyou have to make sure that you have your\nCPU on and your PSU is connected, right.\n\n89\n00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:01.690\nWhat the heck are we talking about, right,\nI just fed you a whole bunch of alphabet\n\n90\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.820\nsoup and I didn't give you a spoon to\nfigure out how to eat that alphabet soup,\n\n91\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.560\nright, so we have to avoid\nthings like jargon, right.\n\n92\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.830\nOkay you've got a power issue, so\nyou're plugging this into the wall and\n\n93\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.230\nunfortunately that power isn't\ngetting into the computer, right.\n\n94\n00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.080\nRather than saying hey, this is a PSU\nissue and they have no, your customer, or\n\n95\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.104\nthe person that you're supporting,\n\n96\n00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:26.110\nit could be somebody who's working next to\nyou, has no clue what a power supply unit\n\n97\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.225\nis, right, so we have to avoid\nthe commonality of jargon, right.\n\n98\n00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:35.275\nDan and I, one of the other hosts here,\nwe talked in one episode, we wanted to see\n\n99\n00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:42.327\nkind of joking, Zach, how long of\na conversation that we could go through\n\n100\n00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:47.247\nwithout mentioning one real word other\nthan acronyms and connecting words, right.\n\n101\n00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.647\nLike, you have your HDMI connection,\nyou have your SATA ports,\n\n102\n00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:55.840\nyou have a PSU, you have LCD,\nyou have LED, right.\n\n103\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.589\nAnd to somebody that's in the industry\nthey'll be like yeah, they're not making\n\n104\n00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.036\nany sense regardless, they're just\nthrowing a bunch of acronyms out there.\n\n105\n00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:06.222\nBut you have to understand that's\nwhat normal, I say normal people,\n\n106\n00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:08.277\nI don't know if that\neven makes sense [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:12.055\nBut that's what the average person,\nright, the lay person that\n\n108\n00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:16.866\nisn't into computing is gonna hear, right,\nthey're not gonna hear anything but\n\n109\n00:06:16.866 --> 00:06:21.283\na bunch of garbled mess, so avoid\nthe jargon, avoid the acronyms, right.\n\n110\n00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:26.323\nI used to listen to this gentleman\nthat graduated out of Stanford,\n\n111\n00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:31.100\nhe had a PhD in philosophies of education,\nbrilliant person.\n\n112\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.530\nAnd through his studies he probably had\nobtained, like, 14 different languages\n\n113\n00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.340\nthat we was fluent in and could break\nthem down and stuff, very smart person.\n\n114\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.945\nAnd he would always talk to us, he would\nalways explain something in a way that\n\n115\n00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:46.980\na person that just walked\nin off the streets,\n\n116\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.580\nthat had never seen the situation,\ncould understand.\n\n117\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.000\nAnd he'd always say you are smart\nenough to understand this and\n\n118\n00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.020\nhe'd step back and he'd explain it.\n\n119\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.730\nAnd he'd have things like Greek\nlanguage on the board behind him and\n\n120\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.800\nsomehow you couldn't understand what was\nup on that board, but you could understand\n\n121\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.290\nthe point that he was making because he\nwould take it and he would simplify it.\n\n122\n00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.410\nAnd he would always say you're\nsmart enough to understand this,\n\n123\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.250\njust because you don't understand what's\ngoing on back here, let me go ahead and\n\n124\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.220\nlet me explain it to you.\n\n125\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.240\nYou need to be willing to do that to\nthe customers that you're gonna support so\n\n126\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.780\nthat they can understand that\nyou're there to help them.\n\n127\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.380\nAnd you're not there to put yourself up\non a pedestal and toot your own horn,\n\n128\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.280\nbecause that can happen and that\nperception can happen very, very quickly,\n\n129\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.030\nso be careful with that, right.\n\n130\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:35.750\nWhen applicable avoid slang, right, try\nto talk in a way that makes sense, right.\n\n131\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.670\nBecause to the average person that's just\nusing a computer all they wanna do is push\n\n132\n00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.022\nthe power button on it,\nand they wanna login, and\n\n133\n00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:44.654\nthey wanna be able to do their\nday to day operations, and\n\n134\n00:07:44.654 --> 00:07:47.526\nwhen that doesn't happen that\ncan be problematic, right.\n\n135\n00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:50.663\nIt can be problematic in the fact\nthat they feel less productive,\n\n136\n00:07:50.663 --> 00:07:53.228\nit could be the fact that it\nputs their job on the line,\n\n137\n00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:56.377\nit could be a company that starts\nto lose productivity and money.\n\n138\n00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:59.432\nAnd it's up to you to be that\nguiding light in the storm, right?\n\n139\n00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:01.290\nYou have to be the watchman on the wall.\n\n140\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.570\nYou have to be the light tower.\n\n141\n00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.300\nAnd, right, you don't put a light\ntower and throw a cover over it.\n\n142\n00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.540\nIt would make no sense,\nthat just makes no sense, right?\n\n143\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.200\nSo make sense and make sure that people\ncan understand and see where you're going\n\n144\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.990\nwith any kind of thing that\nyou're helping somebody out with.\n\n145\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n146\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.310\n&gt;&gt; Now, the other thing that we have\nto worry about in proper language and\n\n147\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.950\ncommunication is maintaining\na positive attitude.\n\n148\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.980\nAnd I tell you, ladies and gentlemen,\nhere I am up here telling you to do that.\n\n149\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.610\nAnd sometimes I don't practice\nwhat I preach, all right.\n\n150\n00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.650\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean, Wes?\n\n151\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.660\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n152\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, right?\n\n153\n00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:35.685\nThat's something that we do\nhave to try to do, right?\n\n154\n00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:38.530\nOne of our mottos here at ITProTV.\n\n155\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.820\nIn fact, you could find it if you ever\ndown to the Gainesville location.\n\n156\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.070\nYou can come down to our location.\n\n157\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.550\nAnd we encourage you to, by the way.\n\n158\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.410\nYou will find logos,\nit's one of our mottos, one of our mantra\n\n159\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.060\nhere is that we willingly face\nchallenges with optimism, right.\n\n160\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.670\nNot pessimism and disdain but optimism,\nright, because it's gonna happen.\n\n161\n00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.760\nBut if you maintain\nthat positive attitude,\n\n162\n00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.160\nagain, you are gonna be the calm in\nthe storm when everything is going crazy.\n\n163\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.021\n&gt;&gt; A problem [CROSSTALK] gift\nthat you have to be unwrapped.\n\n164\n00:09:08.021 --> 00:09:12.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, great way to put it,\nproject confidence, right.\n\n165\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.820\nI've had people before tell me, i n fact,\nI had somebody just yesterday tell me that\n\n166\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.340\nsaid, man, said you can speak\npretty decently in front of people.\n\n167\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.980\nAnd people don't realize that behind\nthe scenes, I'm as nervous as heck.\n\n168\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.400\nMy blood is just sitting there,\nI'm just really, really nervous.\n\n169\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.470\nIt's because, when it's game time,\njust like a coach would tell an athlete.\n\n170\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.340\nYou put your game face on and you jump in.\n\n171\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.850\nRemember, courage isn't\nthe absence of fear.\n\n172\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.000\nWe've heard this before, right?\n\n173\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.960\nIt's the ability to jump in in spite\nof fear, so project confidence as well.\n\n174\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.410\nBe culturally sensitive, all right?\n\n175\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.210\nNow I don't have to say\nthis in the United States.\n\n176\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.940\nWe got a lot of turmoil going on in\na lot of different locations across\n\n177\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.030\nthe United States at this point in time.\n\n178\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.180\nWe are a melting pot of culture, right?\n\n179\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.130\nAnd it should be a good thing, right?\n\n180\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:04.120\nBe culturally sensitive, understand that,\nbe mindful of other people, right?\n\n181\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.000\nUse professional titles when you can,\nright?\n\n182\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.300\nAgain, it's more of an ethics thing,\nright.\n\n183\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.290\nUnderstand that there\nare different cultures, right?\n\n184\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.980\nA lot of times,\n\n185\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.970\nthe only thing that is really separating\nus is a lack of understanding, all right.\n\n186\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.110\nSo, be culturally sensitive, right.\n\n187\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.450\nA big thing, too, and\nthis is a really big thing.\n\n188\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.940\nAnd I tell you with the generations today,\n\n189\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:33.780\nit is kind of becoming an after thought,\nright?\n\n190\n00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.994\nAnd that's being on time, all right,\n\n191\n00:10:37.994 --> 00:10:42.750\nyou don't get a reward for\nbeing on time, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.330\nIf you think you deserve a reward for\nbeing on time,\n\n193\n00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.840\nthen you're in the wrong business,\nall right?\n\n194\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.560\nWhen you're on time, you're doing nothing\nmore than what you're paid to do,\n\n195\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.090\nyou're doing your job.\n\n196\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.134\nSo don't expect a trophy on the wall\nbecause you showed up on time.\n\n197\n00:10:57.134 --> 00:11:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact, one of my employees\njust told me, you can't be early or\n\n198\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.970\nlate, wink wink.\n\n199\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.830\n&gt;&gt; And in fact I was in the commercial\npainting industry for awhile.\n\n200\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.360\nAnd it's funny that you mention that Zach,\nor just interesting that you mention that.\n\n201\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.625\nBecause my boss, we used to have to get\nour work truck ready and prepped for\n\n202\n00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.925\nthe day's job that we\nwere gonna go out and do.\n\n203\n00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.915\nSo we had to get there 15 minutes early.\n\n204\n00:11:17.915 --> 00:11:22.547\nIf you weren't 15 minutes early, you're\n5 minutes late is what he used to say.\n\n205\n00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:24.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and\n\n206\n00:11:24.055 --> 00:11:26.055\ndo I expect any trophy for it?\n\n207\n00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:32.150\nNo, not at all, that's what's\nexpected of me, so be on time.\n\n208\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.230\nHere's the other thing too, one of\nthe other things is to avoid distractions.\n\n209\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.390\nI am not the person to teach\nyou to avoid distractions.\n\n210\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.510\nI have so\nmany squirrel moments all day long, right.\n\n211\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.810\nBut you do have to do that,\nhere are some of the basics.\n\n212\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.580\nPeople get distracted, it happens,\nright, that just happens.\n\n213\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.230\nHere are some things though\nthat basically you can help.\n\n214\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.740\nPersonal calls,\nthere is no excuse for them, right?\n\n215\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.459\nUnless there's an emergency, you shouldn't\nbe taking personal calls when you're in\n\n216\n00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:05.866\nthe middle of helping somebody or\n\n217\n00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:08.950\nyou're in the middle of\ncommunicating with somebody.\n\n218\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.680\nI wouldn't even do that to Zach\nwhen we're sitting here off camera.\n\n219\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.710\nI would say hold on Zach,\nthis is an important call.\n\n220\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.330\nI do have to take it, I apologize,\nbut I'd probably let him know.\n\n221\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.820\nNow, there's different things,\nfor you guys out there,\n\n222\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.670\nyou have a wife that's\nready to go into labor.\n\n223\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.610\nI mean, obviously,\n\n224\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.730\nyou have somebody that's going\ninto surgery, you make them aware.\n\n225\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.450\nI don't like taking personal calls.\n\n226\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.280\nI do apologize, but at some point in our\nconversation in the work that I'm doing,\n\n227\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.440\nI might have to take this call.\n\n228\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.660\nSo I'm at least making them aware of it.\n\n229\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:46.420\nBut, at best, try to keep it out of\nwhatever work environment you're in.\n\n230\n00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.670\nAnd what I mean by that is\nthe situation that you're currently in.\n\n231\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:54.160\nTexting and social media,\nsocial media sites!\n\n232\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.560\nThis one irritates me more than anything.\n\n233\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.040\nI have had people, and I will not\neven do this to somebody that is,\n\n234\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.410\nyeah I'll give you an example.\n\n235\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.230\nI don't like this one at all.\n\n236\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.960\nI won't even do that, I won't even take a\ncall, I won't even post to a social media\n\n237\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.190\nsite when I'm walking through\nthe line check out at a supermarket.\n\n238\n00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.140\nRight, buying my groceries, why?\n\n239\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.880\nI find that is rude as heck to that\nperson that's [LAUGH] taking the time to\n\n240\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.130\njust cash you out, right?\n\n241\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.350\nYou've probably seen that before.\n\n242\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.340\nSome of you are probably like I was,\n\n243\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.830\na career changer coming\nfrom things like fast food,\n\n244\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.900\nwhere you got somebody, hold on a second,\nor hold on, I gotta post to Facebook.\n\n245\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.540\nNow I'm not cutting down Facebook,\nthat's not what I mean, right.\n\n246\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.180\nIt's just the fact that this person\ncan't take enough time to put their\n\n247\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.910\nphone in their pocket, put it on mute and\npay attention to you as the customer.\n\n248\n00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.090\nSo if you're like me, and\n\n249\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.100\nagain, I might just be a little\nbit more sensitive to that.\n\n250\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.930\nBut if you're like me, that doesn't\ntranslate well to the customer.\n\n251\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Plus, Wes, it's dangerous,\nyou can run into somebody,\n\n252\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.410\nthey can run into you, you can get hurt.\n\n253\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.540\nPeople have been hit by cars,\n\n254\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.890\npeople have gotten in accidents,\nit's very good advice.\n\n255\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.070\n&gt;&gt; And another one too almost\nalong that same lines,\n\n256\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.040\nis talking to coworkers while\nyou're trying to help somebody.\n\n257\n00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.570\nI cannot stand that, I've seen that so may\ntimes and it's so unprofessional, right?\n\n258\n00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.790\nBecause, again, in some of the management\ntraining that I was in through,\n\n259\n00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.310\nwe stuck to our guns on things.\n\n260\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.590\nWe were trained the right way.\n\n261\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.650\nI believe we were trained professionally,\nwe were trained the right way.\n\n262\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.370\nAnd I can't stand when you're going up and\n\n263\n00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.240\nyou're ordering something from,\nmaybe from a fast food place.\n\n264\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.030\nAnd somebody's sitting there, Zach, okay,\n\n265\n00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.220\nyeah, last week we were gonna do blah\nblah blah blah, right, or whatever.\n\n266\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.232\nAnd telling us about how that their\nco-worker, how their employee is.\n\n267\n00:14:35.232 --> 00:14:39.940\nOr Zach, I can't stand that Don guy,\nwhatever.\n\n268\n00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.620\nYou're having the conversation with your\ncoworkers at the time that you're supposed\n\n269\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.120\nto be focused on a customer, or\nsome kind of help situation.\n\n270\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.080\nAnd again that's very very rude,\nand it's very unprofessional.\n\n271\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.930\nIt doesn't exude good professionalism.\n\n272\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.710\nPersonal interruptions is another one, and\n\n273\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:03.290\nagain, sometimes it does happen that\nyou're going to get interrupted.\n\n274\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:09.780\nBut if you cannot avoid it,\nmake the person aware going into it.\n\n275\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.960\nLike i said,\nif you know that it's gonna be, again,\n\n276\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.130\nmaybe your wife out there is\ngoing to be giving birth.\n\n277\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.290\nMaybe you've got a child out there\nthat's going to be going into surgery.\n\n278\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.310\nI mean there are certain things that\nI bet you, if you make the customer,\n\n279\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.440\nif you make the employer aware\nthat this has to happen,\n\n280\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.410\nthey are gonna be perfectly fine with it.\n\n281\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.755\nBut if we're right in\nthe middle of the conversation.\n\n282\n00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:38.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I turn off to the side,\n\n283\n00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.740\nI mean that doesn't really translate well.\n\n284\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.020\nSo right, hopefully that makes sense.\n\n285\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.879\nHere's another one and\nthis one again can be, and\n\n286\n00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:50.624\nanybody that's in fast food right now or\ndoes customer service,\n\n287\n00:15:50.624 --> 00:15:55.006\nyou already know what I am about to talk\nabout in these situations all right.\n\n288\n00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:57.700\nMaybe some of you haven't\nhad to deal with that,\n\n289\n00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.905\nif you are coming from things like\nthe construction industry and stuff, but\n\n290\n00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:06.656\nthis is Dealing with a difficult customer\nsituation, right, don't be defensive.\n\n291\n00:16:06.656 --> 00:16:11.094\nWhen you go on the defense you\nmight as well just stop whatever\n\n292\n00:16:11.094 --> 00:16:13.104\nconversation it is right.\n\n293\n00:16:13.104 --> 00:16:18.689\nSo I actually got this from\nLL Cool J of all people.\n\n294\n00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:20.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never know where little\n\n295\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.710\nbits of wisdom are gonna come from.\n\n296\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.780\nHe goes, I don't fight fire with fire,\n\n297\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.150\nI'm a real man,\nreal men fight fire with water, all right.\n\n298\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.820\nAnd I was like, that is a great saying and\n\n299\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.230\nit's something that I would as I was\ntraining a crew that would work with me.\n\n300\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.020\nIt's something I passed on to them,\n\n301\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.640\nespecially when it comes to dealing\nwith an unruly customer or a customer.\n\n302\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.185\nAnd that customer might have every\nreason to be in their bad mood and\n\n303\n00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:48.175\nthey're taking it out on you,\nand your the backboard.\n\n304\n00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:49.325\nIt happens right?\n\n305\n00:16:49.325 --> 00:16:51.635\nBut don't fight fire with fire right?\n\n306\n00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:53.745\nBecause if you start\nthrowing back a defense,\n\n307\n00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:56.945\nall you're doing is escalating\nthe severity of the situation right?\n\n308\n00:16:56.945 --> 00:16:58.655\nEven if it isn't that severe.\n\n309\n00:16:58.655 --> 00:17:01.415\n&gt;&gt; In fact here's another\ngreat platitude for you.\n\n310\n00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:04.455\nAnd that is do you wanna be right,\nor do you wanna be happy?\n\n311\n00:17:04.455 --> 00:17:05.755\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I like that one.\n\n312\n00:17:05.755 --> 00:17:08.945\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good one,\navoid dismissing the customer's problem.\n\n313\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.010\nDon't do that, all right.\n\n314\n00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.330\nI've said this in other episodes\nwhere I can afford to lose\n\n315\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.980\nany piece of software I don't\ncare if it's an operating system.\n\n316\n00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.520\nI don't care if it's on\na server operating system,\n\n317\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.780\nI don't care if it's a piece\nof line of business software.\n\n318\n00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.600\nI can replace it,\nit's not that big of a deal for me.\n\n319\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.047\nThe only thing I can't replace,\nand I've said this, and Zach,\n\n320\n00:17:30.047 --> 00:17:33.049\nyou've heard me say this too cuz you've\nbeen in many of these episodes with me.\n\n321\n00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:35.211\nI can't replace the photos of my family,\nright.\n\n322\n00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:35.758\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n323\n00:17:35.758 --> 00:17:39.454\n&gt;&gt; That's the only thing to me that,\nman, I would, hopefully not, but\n\n324\n00:17:39.454 --> 00:17:43.450\nI would have a heart attack\nif I couldn't replace, right.\n\n325\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.450\nBut if you have somebody that their\nlivelihood is sitting on their computer\n\n326\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.170\nright now.\n\n327\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.570\nAll of their documents, they do their\nbusiness from it, maybe they're a SOHO,\n\n328\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.840\na small office, home office.\n\n329\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.373\nThey work from home, and that operating\nsystem fails I wouldn't say [SOUND] it's\n\n330\n00:17:56.373 --> 00:17:59.118\nnot a big deal,\nit's just an operating system.\n\n331\n00:17:59.118 --> 00:18:01.920\nNo worries, right,\ndismissing their problem.\n\n332\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.480\nNow what you could do is say hey,\nthat's a bad situation,\n\n333\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.832\nbut we're gonna get you checked out.\n\n334\n00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:12.990\nWe're gonna get it, chances are I could\nprobably get your data off of there.\n\n335\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.320\nI've seen this before, operating systems,\nas bad as it sounds right now because you\n\n336\n00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.043\ncan't use your computer and\nit's your livelihood.\n\n337\n00:18:20.043 --> 00:18:22.850\nWe could probably get this thing back\nonline and get it back going, right.\n\n338\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.300\nI'm not dismissing the customer's problem\nbut I am trying again, fire with water.\n\n339\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.320\nWe're trying to let the customer\nknow that it's gonna be okay.\n\n340\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.110\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n341\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.290\neven if you don't know if it's okay, yet.\n\n342\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.940\nClarifying customer statements,\n\n343\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.040\nthis is a great thing to say\nbecause it's active listening.\n\n344\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.950\nActive listening is very,\nvery important right.\n\n345\n00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:48.470\nSo Zach what you're telling me\nis that old job that you had,\n\n346\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.640\nthe boss would say you better be on time,\nyou better be early to be on time, right.\n\n347\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.120\nMaybe I didn't hear it right, right,\n\n348\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.130\nI'm not actually telling you what he just\nsaid but I'm trying to clarify it right.\n\n349\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.510\nAnd he might have to restate it,\n\n350\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.690\nno Wes that wasn't what I said at\nall let me restate it for you.\n\n351\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.825\nAgain it's that inter personal dialogue,\nit's that dialogue that you're trying to\n\n352\n00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:11.500\ncreate that allows one, the customer to\nknow that you're paying attention to them.\n\n353\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.770\nThat you give a darn enough to pay\nattention to what they are talking about.\n\n354\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.978\nAnd another thing that it's also gonna\nhelp progress whatever the situation is\n\n355\n00:19:19.978 --> 00:19:21.290\nthat you're in.\n\n356\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.010\nIt narrows down the scope of\nthe problem which is a great thing.\n\n357\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.460\nRestate the issue, right.\n\n358\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.570\nSo Zach,\nwhat you are telling me is x, y, z.\n\n359\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.550\nSo active listening,\nparaphrasing, restating, right.\n\n360\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.580\nAll these things you should know.\n\n361\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.950\n&gt;&gt; And you know you're getting another\nthing too, is using their name.\n\n362\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; People love to hear their name and\n\n363\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.600\nthat makes them feel that\nthey're respected and\n\n364\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.450\nagain you're paying attention.\n\n365\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.120\n&gt;&gt; That’s right, you've got to\nmake sure that you try to exude\n\n366\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.940\nthat you're there to help them, right.\n\n367\n00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.390\nYou're just a desk if you don't put\nthe help in it, right, help desk, right?\n\n368\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.515\nYou're just a glorified paper weight.\n\n369\n00:19:57.515 --> 00:20:00.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't disclose experiences,\n\n370\n00:20:00.755 --> 00:20:06.520\ndon't disclose experiences at all via\nthings like social media outlets.\n\n371\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.830\nMan I went over to that\nguy Zach's desk today.\n\n372\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.773\nAnd I have to tell you this customer\nthat I was dealing with as I'm out there\n\n373\n00:20:15.773 --> 00:20:19.200\non Facebook man,\nhe had a flat tire the other day and\n\n374\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.264\nit's because he doesn't know how to drive.\n\n375\n00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:25.398\nThings like that, and\nI'm just giving you an example, right.\n\n376\n00:20:25.398 --> 00:20:28.401\nYou don't shame a customer like that,\n\n377\n00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:31.950\nespecially on a social media outlet,\nright?\n\n378\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.290\nNot only to mention that, that could\nget you in really, really bad trouble.\n\n379\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.818\nYou can ask a lot of celebrities right now\nthat are having to going through that and\n\n380\n00:20:39.818 --> 00:20:42.920\nthey have to recant their statements and\nthen they lose half their customer base.\n\n381\n00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.970\nNow imagine a company's reputation\nif you do something like that.\n\n382\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.340\nSame thing applies too, right.\n\n383\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.360\nLet's see what else have we got there.\n\n384\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.860\nI know again we are hammering on a lot,\nwe got just a few more here.\n\n385\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.698\nZach, one of the things is set and\nmeet expectations, all right.\n\n386\n00:20:58.698 --> 00:21:00.115\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n387\n00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:06.165\nAll right, if you've ever taken your\ncar to a mechanic shop, all right.\n\n388\n00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:08.125\nNow the car won't start at this time, but\n\n389\n00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:11.630\nyou also got this strange clicking\nnoise that you've heard too, right.\n\n390\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.250\nBut when you take it to the mechanic,\nyou say hey it's not starting.\n\n391\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.380\nWell you don't wait til\nthe mechanic's got the car up and\n\n392\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.260\nsay hey I need you to check\nthis out as well right?\n\n393\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.220\nYou might have to address\nthat at a later time.\n\n394\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:27.100\nSo you let somebody know hey\nI'm here to fix this issue.\n\n395\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.344\nOr maybe help desk is coming\nthey're coming to help desk.\n\n396\n00:21:30.344 --> 00:21:33.690\nYou've submitted a ticket for\nthis problem, right, so\n\n397\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.700\nyou let them know,\nthis is what I'm here to do,\n\n398\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.470\nthis is potentially what I'm gonna do,\nthis is what I think it might be.\n\n399\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.070\nCould take an hour or so, could take\ntwo hours, it's gonna be data recovery.\n\n400\n00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.872\nAnd you've got a one terabyte drive,\nyou might need to go home tonight and\n\n401\n00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:49.650\njust come back and\nwe'll hope it's there tomorrow.\n\n402\n00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.180\nSo let them know, right?\n\n403\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.346\nIt's good to know what's coming\naround the corner, right,\n\n404\n00:21:55.346 --> 00:21:57.358\nbefore you get to the corner.\n\n405\n00:21:57.358 --> 00:22:01.790\nThat's another thing that I like to say\nwhen it comes to supporting customers.\n\n406\n00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:06.990\nLet them know, ahead of time, what your\nhere to do, what you think you might do,\n\n407\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.450\nand how long it might take, right.\n\n408\n00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.590\nOffer different repairs,\nsolutions, right, if you can,\n\n409\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.480\nreplacement options, if you can.\n\n410\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.900\nThis is one of the things\nthat I'll always remember.\n\n411\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.600\nThere's a certain nerdy squad out\nthere that fixes electronics and\n\n412\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.480\nthey've had a reputation for\n\n413\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.470\nnot being, I don't know,\nthey're ethics, isn't that great?\n\n414\n00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.364\nRight, being more sales people.\n\n415\n00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:36.935\nAnd I kinda,\nalmost fell on that bandwagon.\n\n416\n00:22:36.935 --> 00:22:41.781\nUntil I went to that same location,\nI had a failed graphics adapter,\n\n417\n00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:45.302\nfailed, just seized up on me and\nwouldn't work.\n\n418\n00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:48.583\nSo I knew I need, I was studying,\nI was an A plus student at the time, so\n\n419\n00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:50.840\nI knew I needed a graphics card.\n\n420\n00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.380\nAnd I went in there and I said,\nI talked to the manager of that\n\n421\n00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.910\ncertain nerdy squad, and\nI said I need a graphics card.\n\n422\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.980\nAnd he said, okay well,\nlet's go over here and\n\n423\n00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.080\nwe'll look at some of the ones we got,\nall right.\n\n424\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.727\nHere comes the salesman, right,\nbecause that's the reputation\n\n425\n00:23:05.727 --> 00:23:08.800\nthat the company had got and\nI said, yeah there's one.\n\n426\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.353\nIt's $189 it was and there was one that\nwas $159 and there was one that was $79.\n\n427\n00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:20.516\nI was like I don't really want the $79\none, bigger, better, and faster, right.\n\n428\n00:23:20.516 --> 00:23:23.285\nSo I say I'll go midrange, right?\n\n429\n00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:26.300\nI don't want to get\n$189 I'll get the $159.\n\n430\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.370\nSo he turned around to me and he asked,\nwhat are you gonna use this card for?\n\n431\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.450\nAnd I said well,\ntold him what I was gonna use it for.\n\n432\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.280\nHe goes,\nI would love to sell you this card.\n\n433\n00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.660\nIt's gonna look good on my resume.\n\n434\n00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.540\nIt's gonna look good on my\nnumbers at the end of the week.\n\n435\n00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.620\nHe said, but unless you're doing and\nhe gave me four different options, you'll\n\n436\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.960\nnever see the power of that card and that\n$79 card's gonna be more than you need.\n\n437\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.006\nAnd you'll save money.\n\n438\n00:23:48.006 --> 00:23:51.663\nHe won a customer for life, and\nhe won this story always being,\n\n439\n00:23:51.663 --> 00:23:55.121\nI've said this story now for\nthe last seven, eight years.\n\n440\n00:23:55.121 --> 00:23:57.542\nBecause of that,\nI'll always remember that.\n\n441\n00:23:57.542 --> 00:24:00.146\nThat's the experience\nthat a customer wants.\n\n442\n00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:05.030\nThat's the experience that you want\nto give, if you have other options.\n\n443\n00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.800\nDon't try to sell somebody a $2,000\ncomputer when they're just sending emails,\n\n444\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.400\nwhen the $300 computer will do just fine.\n\n445\n00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.830\nListen to your customers, be aware of what\nthey're doing, be mindful of their needs.\n\n446\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.620\nAnd don't try to get one over on them.\n\n447\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.350\nAnd you never know when you might do,\n\n448\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.460\nlike that gentleman did to me, he's now\nthe manager of the place and rightfully so\n\n449\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:30.120\nthe way he treated me,\nyou win a customer for life, right.\n\n450\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.140\nIt's a good road map of your\nsincerity as well as experience,\n\n451\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.410\nthe fact that you do have ethics.\n\n452\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.360\nProper documentation of\nthe services provided, right?\n\n453\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.040\nIt's not time for fine print.\n\n454\n00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.940\nNow, this might be out of your control,\nright?\n\n455\n00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.210\nYou might work for a company, but you\nneed to submit the proper documentation,\n\n456\n00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.470\nnot only to protect yourself, but\nalso for warranty information and\n\n457\n00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.420\nprotect your company too.\n\n458\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.360\nFollow up with the customer\nat the later date,\n\n459\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.140\nI cannot stress this enough, all right.\n\n460\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.450\nYou fix something for\na customer, you verify,\n\n461\n00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:00.940\nwe talked about our\ntrouble shooting theory.\n\n462\n00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.355\nWe said one of the theory steps in there\nis verifying full functionality,right.\n\n463\n00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:09.607\nAnd one of the things I told is that\nverify with the customer that it's full\n\n464\n00:25:09.607 --> 00:25:14.148\nfunctionality, Dan mention this too,\nand I agree, call back in three days.\n\n465\n00:25:14.148 --> 00:25:16.110\nHey, hows everything running?\n\n466\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:23.000\nDoes it seem like the trouble\nhas been alleviated or whatever,\n\n467\n00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.250\nthe problem, your computer experience\nis still good or whatever?\n\n468\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.560\nIs what you wanna find out, right?\n\n469\n00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.120\nAnd again,\nyou're establishing these relationships.\n\n470\n00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.820\nI can't tell you how in one business that\nI worked for, the recommendations and\n\n471\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:42.100\nthe referrals were worth more than the job\nwas at the time we got paid for it.\n\n472\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.993\nBecause those recommendations and\nreferrals got us more jobs in the future.\n\n473\n00:25:45.993 --> 00:25:49.397\nSo we might of paid $1,000 or\ngot paid $1,000 for\n\n474\n00:25:49.397 --> 00:25:52.599\nthe job that we were doing now and\nyeah that's great, but\n\n475\n00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:57.180\nwe've got 17 referrals out of it and\neach one of those jobs were $1,000.\n\n476\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.130\nSo we got $17,000 based\non the the credible or\n\n477\n00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.040\nhonest work that we were doing.\n\n478\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.470\nDeal appropriate with customers\nconfidential and private information and\n\n479\n00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.340\nmaterials.\n\n480\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.850\nIt says that are located on the computer,\nthe desktop, and the printer, okay.\n\n481\n00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.430\nHere's something I want you to remember,\nthe last thing, and we'll go ahead and\n\n482\n00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.290\nwrap up here, Zach,\nis the fact that on the exam,\n\n483\n00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.630\nif they give you a scenario that talk\nabout customer confidentiality and\n\n484\n00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.755\nPII, personally identifiable information,\nwhich we talked about in another episode.\n\n485\n00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:31.801\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever the scenario is, look at\n\n486\n00:26:31.801 --> 00:26:38.800\nthe answers and the most confidential\nanswer is mostly likely your right answer.\n\n487\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.850\nIf you look at an answer\nin the list that says,\n\n488\n00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.720\nhey somebody's got some payment\ncard information, right?\n\n489\n00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.470\nSome PII, some Social Security numbers,\n\n490\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.280\nright, has some contract\ninformation up on the desk.\n\n491\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.750\nWhat do you do at the desk or\nwould what do you with the documents?\n\n492\n00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.290\nIf one of those answers make you laugh,\nand I'm not kidding you when I say this,\n\n493\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.420\ngood test taking skills,\nit's not the right answer.\n\n494\n00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.170\nIf you kind of go [LAUGH],\nthat's not the right answer.\n\n495\n00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:05.960\nMark it out of your list.\n\n496\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.920\nNow, here's why I say that.\n\n497\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.250\nYou might get an answer that says\ncasually browse the documents and\n\n498\n00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.010\nwrite everything down.\n\n499\n00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.273\nI could see Zach over here.\n\n500\n00:27:14.273 --> 00:27:15.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can't see Zach.\n\n501\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.070\nHe's trying to hold in a laugh\nover here right now, right?\n\n502\n00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Not good, this is not good.\n\n503\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.637\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and exactly,\nyou see what I did there?\n\n504\n00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:23.658\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I saw what you did.\n\n505\n00:27:23.658 --> 00:27:27.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, so\nhe's laughing at it, and rightfully so.\n\n506\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.190\nThat's exactly why I did that,\n\n507\n00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.130\nbecause of the fact that that laugh\ntells you that's not the right answer.\n\n508\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.760\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n509\n00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.090\nIt'll help you to eliminate\npossible wrong answers,\n\n510\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.360\nwhatever the most\nconfidential answer might be.\n\n511\n00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.220\nLet's give you a couple\nof potential answers.\n\n512\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:48.810\nOne, that says ignore the documents,\none that says turn the documents over,\n\n513\n00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:54.840\none that says, ask the customer to secure\nthe documents before you start working.\n\n514\n00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.860\nWhich one do you think\nmight be right there Zach?\n\n515\n00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.950\n&gt;&gt; Secure the documents.\n\n516\n00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.640\n&gt;&gt; Right secure the documents, or\nask them to secure the documents.\n\n517\n00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely that last one right?\n\n518\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.570\nBecause you're telling whoa,\n\n519\n00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.960\nyou need to take care of these\nbefore I sit down right?\n\n520\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.230\nIt's the most secure answer.\n\n521\n00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.760\nAnd I would say, can't guarantee,\nbut if I can give you any piece of\n\n522\n00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.040\nadvice it's probably gonna be\nthe right answer on the exam.\n\n523\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.540\nTreat every piece of confidential and\nprivate information as confidential and\n\n524\n00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.335\nas private as you can in any scenario\nthat you are given on the exam, and\n\n525\n00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:25.925\nin real life.\n\n526\n00:28:25.925 --> 00:28:30.925\nOutside of an exam environment, and\nyou will be doing well for this A+ exam.\n\n527\n00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:32.405\n&gt;&gt; Awesome information, thanks Wes.\n\n528\n00:28:32.405 --> 00:28:36.490\nCommunication and\nprofessionalism inside of Accelerated

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:15.921\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for choosing ITPRO\nTV, helping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n4\n00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:20.796\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with Excel rated CompTIA A+ we're\n\n5\n00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:22.746\nlooking at display devices and\n\n6\n00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:27.550\nWes Bryan is here because he's our\nIT expert Wes thanks for joining us.\n\n7\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.480\n&gt;&gt; Hey how are you doing Zach, great to be\nback, that's right we're gonna be look at,\n\n8\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.300\nwell, how do we actually see the results\nfrom our computing experience, right.\n\n9\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.576\nIn other episodes, we've been\ntalking a lot about the mechanics.\n\n10\n00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:40.919\nWe've been talking about\nthe internal makeup and\n\n11\n00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:42.877\nworkings of if you will of your computer.\n\n12\n00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:46.975\nWe've been talking about communications,\nall kinds of things, but\n\n13\n00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.863\nnow it really comes down to how do\nwe see the results of all that stuff\n\n14\n00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:55.051\nthat's going on inside of the system and\nthat's what it boils down to.\n\n15\n00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.370\nIt boils down to the output being really\nthrough your display devices, right?\n\n16\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.222\nSo we're gonna talk about\nsome different technologies.\n\n17\n00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:06.931\nWe'll mention one that's kinda\ngone by the wayside as well, and\n\n18\n00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.460\nI remember it being on my first A plus\ntest but thank goodness it's not anymore.\n\n19\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.472\nAnd that's the CRT monitor,\nlet's go ahead we'll dive right in we'll\n\n20\n00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:18.431\ntalk about the types of\ndisplay devices that we have,\n\n21\n00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:22.045\nI guess I should be careful when I\nsay monitor if you will cuz well,\n\n22\n00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.968\nsome of these also lend\nthemselves out to TVs, too.\n\n23\n00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:28.079\nSo again, we gotta remember\nthese are display devices, and\n\n24\n00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.472\nit doesn't necessarily mean that it's just\ngonna be a computing monitor with mobile\n\n25\n00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:33.399\ndevices as well.\n\n26\n00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.608\nThey have display devices, too, right?\n\n27\n00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:39.960\nTechnically, I guess, it's not a monitor,\nwe would call it a screen, right?\n\n28\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.477\nSo verbage on that one line.\n\n29\n00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.220\nLet me just be a little\ncareful with that one.\n\n30\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.590\nSo, we look at types, right?\n\n31\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.199\nGoing back to the earliest days,\n\n32\n00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:52.115\nwe used to have what was known as the\nCathode Ray Tube, right, the CRT monitors.\n\n33\n00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:55.045\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; These were the bulky monitors.\n\n34\n00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:57.280\nThey were definitely not space savers.\n\n35\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.446\nAnd if you'd ever had to move one of\nthe bigger ones up a couple of flights of\n\n36\n00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:03.582\nstairs, you would realize thank\ngoodness we don't use those anymore.\n\n37\n00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:05.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In fact [LAUGH] it's hard to even\n\n38\n00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:10.497\ndonate these anymore, they're really\nhard to get rid of, any day and age,\n\n39\n00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.442\nor in today's day and\nage I guess I should say.\n\n40\n00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:16.616\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, I'm so old,\nI remember actually going to to the store,\n\n41\n00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:18.774\nusually a drug store and\ntesting the tubes.\n\n42\n00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n43\n00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.671\n&gt;&gt; And changing them out.\n\n44\n00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:25.588\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely and you know so\nwith the CRT monitors they've come and\n\n45\n00:02:25.588 --> 00:02:27.050\ngone by the wayside.\n\n46\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.438\nThey would use three different Rayguns and\na magnet spreader believe it or\n\n47\n00:02:31.438 --> 00:02:33.500\nnot in it to kind of bend the light.\n\n48\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.941\nAnd project that light across the glass\ntube so we don't really use those anymore,\n\n49\n00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.170\nlike I said not to say that you can't see.\n\n50\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.069\nYou won't see them out there, but\nmore so what we use today are liquid\n\n51\n00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.328\ncrystal displays and light emitting\ndiode based display types, right?\n\n52\n00:02:50.328 --> 00:02:54.280\nWe use LCD screens and\nwe use LED screens, all right.\n\n53\n00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.380\nNow, when it comes to LCD screens,\nyou have a few different types.\n\n54\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.554\nBut what I wanna talk about first and\nforemost is the fact that with an LCD and\n\n55\n00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:09.331\nan LED screen, they're using a lot\na of the same technologies, and\n\n56\n00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:11.530\nsome people don't realize that.\n\n57\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.150\nReally what changes with an LCD and\nan LED screen is the backlight.\n\n58\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.500\nWell, how are we producing\nthe light that you see, in an LCD,\n\n59\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.810\nin fact I've got a little diagram here,\nand\n\n60\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.840\nI don't want you guys to remember all\nof these individual layers, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.450\nI want you to just kind of see,\nand I kind of color coded them so\n\n62\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.010\nyou could see that they're\nusing the same technology.\n\n63\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.861\nRight now the underlining ones,\n\n64\n00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:38.970\nwhat I've got underlined we're gonna\ntalk about a little bit more here.\n\n65\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.530\nIf you look,\nLCD's if we kind of zoom in here.\n\n66\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.690\nThey have an anti-reflective layer, right,\non the top, If we look, well guess what?\n\n67\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.286\nLED's also,\nhave an anti-reflective layer and\n\n68\n00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:56.259\nthe same thing goes with the polarized\nlayer, the polarizer layer.\n\n69\n00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.570\nWe have a glass layer,\n\n70\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.330\nwe have a color filter then we have\nthis liquid crystal layer, all right?\n\n71\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.680\nNow as we get down here,\nnotice we have this TFT layer, all right?\n\n72\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.535\nI wanna talk about that for a second and\n\n73\n00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:15.593\nnotice that not only does\nthe LCD use a TFT Layer but\n\n74\n00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:18.983\nthe LED uses a TFT Layer, right?\n\n75\n00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:20.840\nAnd what does the TFT mean?\n\n76\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.050\nAll right, that stands for\nThin Film Transistor, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.480\nAnd that is what your more modern\nscreens use, TFT, all right?\n\n78\n00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.590\nAnd that means that you essentially\nhave pixels that are being illuminated\n\n79\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.850\nby these transistors.\n\n80\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.820\nAgain by these thin film transistors but\nnotice then once we get past that layer we\n\n81\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.079\njust have an additional glass layer and\na polarizing layer, right?\n\n82\n00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.920\nAnd you can see that on both sides there's\na reason that I have this up here just to,\n\n83\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.460\nso you can see that you're using\na lot of same technologies.\n\n84\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.790\nHowever, when we look at the LCD,\nnotice the backlight,\n\n85\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.400\nthe light source, the backlight,\nIt is different than the LED all right.\n\n86\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.280\nNow the LED is kind of easy,\nit uses an LED [LAUGH] but the LCD screen,\n\n87\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.860\nit uses something a little bit different,\nit uses what's known as CCFL.\n\n88\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.030\nNow if you're looking at the objectives\nyou might see that it talks about\n\n89\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.770\nflourescent versus LED backlighting and\nyou say well Wes what the heck is a CCFL?\n\n90\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.594\nThis says fluorescent well guess what?\n\n91\n00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.872\nIt's is a cold cathode fluorescent lamp,\n\n92\n00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:35.740\nthat's what they mean\nby fluorescent right.\n\n93\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.460\nAnd when we look at\nfluorescent back lighting,\n\n94\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.861\nit was used pretty much up\nuntil around 2010 all right.\n\n95\n00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:46.821\nAnd what they would do is they'd take\nthe CCFLs, they would either place\n\n96\n00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:50.640\nthem at the opposite end of\nthe LCD screen or on an array,\n\n97\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.954\nthese cold cathode fluorescent lamps\nwould be placed behind the LCD screen.\n\n98\n00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:58.723\nSo what are the characteristics\nof an LCD screen?\n\n99\n00:05:58.723 --> 00:06:02.906\nWell, they are gonna require more power\nbecause of that fluorescent lamp, right?\n\n100\n00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:07.681\nThe fluorescent lighting, they're gonna\nrequire more power because of that\n\n101\n00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:09.860\nlamp they have a shorter life span.\n\n102\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.650\nThey are gonna have shorter life span and\nthey also have a higher latency.\n\n103\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.393\nSo you gamers out there you guys and\ngals you gamers you don't spend all your\n\n104\n00:06:19.393 --> 00:06:22.866\nmoney on rigs,\nyour gaming rigs right, your towers.\n\n105\n00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:27.431\nJust to turn around and have to wait for\nthe sound, right, or wait for\n\n106\n00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:28.943\nthe display, right?\n\n107\n00:06:28.943 --> 00:06:30.240\nYou want the speed, right?\n\n108\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.469\nSo, again, a little bit late,\na little bit more latency.\n\n109\n00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.330\nNow, if we go back to the screen again,\nwe're kinda working down the layers here.\n\n110\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.370\nLED, remember everything's\nthe same all the way until we get\n\n111\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.780\ndown to the LED backlighting, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.396\nAnd that's really one of the major\nthings that kinda separate the two\n\n113\n00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:47.262\ntechnologies apart.\n\n114\n00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:51.620\nNow, we throw a rock in\nthe compound of understanding.\n\n115\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.880\nThey actually have LCDs that\nuse an LED backlighting but\n\n116\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.770\ndon't worry about that on the exam, boy\nis that confusing but primarily, right?\n\n117\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.920\nGenerically speaking the LED backlighting,\nwhat happens?\n\n118\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.930\nAll right well, the LED matrix, all right?\n\n119\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.950\nGuys that have seen\nthe Matrix know what I mean.\n\n120\n00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.880\nA matrix of LED's are placed if\nyou will behind the screen but\n\n121\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.580\nthere's two different types.\n\n122\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.799\nYou have white LED back\nlighting all right,\n\n123\n00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:21.715\nthen you have what's known\nas RGB LED back lighting.\n\n124\n00:07:21.715 --> 00:07:25.346\nRGB, exactly what it sounds like,\nred green blue and\n\n125\n00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:29.787\nyou quite literally have these LEDs,\nlittle three patterns like\n\n126\n00:07:29.787 --> 00:07:34.240\na little tripod if you will and\nit's red, green, blue.\n\n127\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.050\nAll right now, white LED\nbacklighting it's kinda interesting.\n\n128\n00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.301\nIt appears white, it's not really white,\nit's kinda like a combination between\n\n129\n00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:46.006\nyellow and blue that kinda give\nthe appearance of white backlighting but\n\n130\n00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:48.877\nagain, we don't have to worry\nabout that for the exam.\n\n131\n00:07:48.877 --> 00:07:52.874\nWhite backlighting's used in desktops,\nmobile devices, and laptops, all right?\n\n132\n00:07:52.874 --> 00:07:57.051\nRGB LED lighting is used in\nhigh-end applications, right,\n\n133\n00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:59.712\nhigh-end displays, so do know that.\n\n134\n00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.780\nSo what are the benefits\nof an LED backlight?\n\n135\n00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.739\nAll right or an LED screen in general.\n\n136\n00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:06.556\nAll right, well these are the one's\nwhen you turn them sideways,\n\n137\n00:08:06.556 --> 00:08:09.438\nthey almost look like they disappear,\nbecause they're thinner.\n\n138\n00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:14.952\nAgain, thinner is gonna be\na lot better for weight.\n\n139\n00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.495\nSo they're lighter if you will.\n\n140\n00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:21.034\nThen our form factor design,\nthe other thing about them too, LED's,\n\n141\n00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:23.316\nLEDs don't require a lot of power.\n\n142\n00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:27.598\nIf you look at some of the lights\nthat we have today, flash lights,\n\n143\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:32.118\nat the time of this recording we had\na hurricane come through, right.\n\n144\n00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:33.869\nI still love my Maglite, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:35.323\nSo love my Maglite.\n\n146\n00:08:35.323 --> 00:08:36.478\nI'll always buy Maglite.\n\n147\n00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:40.170\nI don't care how many batteries\nyou have to put in them.\n\n148\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:45.734\nBut if you look at a Maglite that's this\nbig versus a light that is LED lights,\n\n149\n00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.558\nnotice that one will take A battery, or\n\n150\n00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:52.344\nAA batteries,\nthe other one will take C batteries.\n\n151\n00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:56.984\nA florescent lamp, a lamp source takes\nmore power, requires more power to\n\n152\n00:08:56.984 --> 00:09:01.403\nilluminate it, and we'll come back\nto luminance here in a second, but\n\n153\n00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:05.253\nan LED requires less power and\nthat's why you have AA in them.\n\n154\n00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:10.098\nNow, I don't know if that's true, you guys\nthat are electrical engineers out there\n\n155\n00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:14.874\nsay, but yeah but you had to put 14 AAs in\nthere, so maybe that's not the case, but\n\n156\n00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:17.524\nLEDs don't require\nthe same amount of power.\n\n157\n00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:22.019\nNow, some of the other characteristics\nthat I wanna kinda talk about when it\n\n158\n00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:24.562\ncomes to like, for instance LCD screens.\n\n159\n00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:27.890\nYou have TN and IPS.\n\n160\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.022\nNow, I'm not talking about beer flavors.\n\n161\n00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:31.137\nWe talk about TN.\n\n162\n00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.338\nWe're talking about twisted nematic.\n\n163\n00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:36.134\nTwisted nematic is the most common and\nthe oldest.\n\n164\n00:09:36.134 --> 00:09:40.552\nIt has a short response time,\nso less delay,\n\n165\n00:09:40.552 --> 00:09:45.915\nit's got a very high brightness,\na lower power draw.\n\n166\n00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:50.243\nSo it's good for gaming,\nit does have a disadvantage,\n\n167\n00:09:50.243 --> 00:09:55.123\neverything does, [LAUGH] pros and\ncons, it doesn't have a wide\n\n168\n00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:59.745\nviewing angle as the in plane\nswitching one, which is IPS.\n\n169\n00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:05.480\nIn plane switching, again better color,\nbetter viewing angles,\n\n170\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.106\nless reflections, but\nat the same time its draw back is\n\n171\n00:10:10.106 --> 00:10:14.749\nlower contrast,\ncontrast ratio more specifically.\n\n172\n00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:17.588\nContrast ratio it's really just a,\n\n173\n00:10:17.588 --> 00:10:21.984\nit's an algorithm that just\ndivides the whitest light,\n\n174\n00:10:21.984 --> 00:10:26.473\nthe brightest white you have,\nand the darkest black, and\n\n175\n00:10:26.473 --> 00:10:32.241\nthat's what it is, just divided, and\nthat ratio, that contrast ratio,\n\n176\n00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:37.920\nthe higher the contrast ratio is a desired\nquality in any display device or\n\n177\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.802\na monitor, so\nthese have lower contrast ratios.\n\n178\n00:10:41.802 --> 00:10:44.205\nAll right so do be aware of that too.\n\n179\n00:10:44.205 --> 00:10:48.796\nOkay so that's a little bit about\nthe flourescent, the LED back lighting,\n\n180\n00:10:48.796 --> 00:10:53.475\nthings like TN, twisted nematic, and\nin plane switching or IPS if you will.\n\n181\n00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:57.331\nAll right now we do have some other types\nthat I wanna talk about too, and Zach,\n\n182\n00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:00.895\nI know we got a list here, but I'm\ngonna kinda go off the beaten path, and\n\n183\n00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:03.495\nI'm gonna jump a couple of\nrungs in the ladder here.\n\n184\n00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:07.989\nI'm gonna go to OLED first, and\nthen we'll come back with some other ones,\n\n185\n00:11:07.989 --> 00:11:11.448\ncuz OLED is becoming more and\nmore popular as time goes on.\n\n186\n00:11:11.448 --> 00:11:14.992\nSo if we can go back to the diagram,\njust for a second here.\n\n187\n00:11:14.992 --> 00:11:18.871\nI got OLED sitting down here, and\nwhat's interesting is it's using a lot of\n\n188\n00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:22.038\nthe same technologies that\nyou're seeing in the LED screen.\n\n189\n00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:22.878\n&gt;&gt; But less?\n\n190\n00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:24.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, but less, right.\n\n191\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.682\nAgain, you still have a polarizing layer,\nyou got a color filtered layer,\n\n192\n00:11:28.682 --> 00:11:31.581\nyou got a liquid crystal layer,\nand you have a TFT layer.\n\n193\n00:11:31.581 --> 00:11:33.367\nAll right, here's the difference.\n\n194\n00:11:33.367 --> 00:11:38.542\nIt uses more of like\na bio-electroluminesence.\n\n195\n00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:40.652\nBoy, that is such a fun thing to say.\n\n196\n00:11:40.652 --> 00:11:41.780\nIt sounds so fancy.\n\n197\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What does it mean?\n\n198\n00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:48.196\nTake an electrical current, plug to\nan organic compound, then you close.\n\n199\n00:11:48.196 --> 00:11:51.967\nThat's all it means, and in fact,\nthis technology's been around for a very,\n\n200\n00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:52.767\nvery long time.\n\n201\n00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:57.115\nNow, it's definitely been revolutionized.\n\n202\n00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:59.474\nIt's definitely been,\nhighly developed, but\n\n203\n00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:02.304\nit's actually been around\nsince the late 40s, 50s.\n\n204\n00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:06.585\nMilitary would do it when they found out\nthat you take two electrodes or electrical\n\n205\n00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:10.822\ncurrent, and hit a citric acid to it that\nit would produce this phosphorus glow.\n\n206\n00:12:10.822 --> 00:12:15.541\nNow obviously, they're doing\na little bit better with it today,\n\n207\n00:12:15.541 --> 00:12:19.501\n[LAUGH] where they can present\nan entire screen here, but\n\n208\n00:12:19.501 --> 00:12:23.207\nthese are ultra thin designs,\nultra low power, and\n\n209\n00:12:23.207 --> 00:12:28.372\nthey have probably the best contrast\nratio of any display on the market.\n\n210\n00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:29.764\nWhy?\n\n211\n00:12:29.764 --> 00:12:34.498\nBelieve it or not, the black color in\n\n212\n00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:39.094\nthem is considered perfect black.\n\n213\n00:12:39.094 --> 00:12:42.384\nSo from the brightest color\nto the darkest color,\n\n214\n00:12:42.384 --> 00:12:45.370\nthat divide is almost considered infinite.\n\n215\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.668\nAll right,\nnow could be just a marketing gimmick, but\n\n216\n00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.262\nthey have almost a perfect black in color.\n\n217\n00:12:51.262 --> 00:12:53.019\nSo they had the highest contrast ratio.\n\n218\n00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:57.075\nSo very, very cool screens, and\nagain using organic compounds.\n\n219\n00:12:57.075 --> 00:12:58.845\nCarbon compounds of some sort, and\n\n220\n00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:02.040\nthey use all different compounds\nto produce different colors.\n\n221\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.628\nNot necessarily the colors\nthat you see with your eyes,\n\n222\n00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:08.002\nbut to produce different colors they\nuse different organic compounds.\n\n223\n00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:12.071\nAnd that's what separates them ultimately\nfrom the LED screens is the fact that\n\n224\n00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:16.018\nthey're using an organic substance with\nelectrical charge placed to it that\n\n225\n00:13:16.018 --> 00:13:17.491\nproduces the light source.\n\n226\n00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:19.894\n&gt;&gt; So Wes we're seeing a lot\nmore of this in smartphones?\n\n227\n00:13:19.894 --> 00:13:23.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that is a great, I'm glad you\nasked that small form factor devices,\n\n228\n00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.138\nZach, it's perfect for it.\n\n229\n00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:29.964\nBecause of the reduced power requirements,\nultra,\n\n230\n00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:33.083\njust crisp, clear, if you will.\n\n231\n00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:36.234\nAnd really just the form factor in\nthe power, because you've been with me.\n\n232\n00:13:36.234 --> 00:13:39.810\nAnd we've talked about some mobile\nepisodes here where we talk\n\n233\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.175\nabout everything is smaller and faster.\n\n234\n00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:46.820\nAnd when we talk about mobile devices, two\nof the big concerns are overheating and\n\n235\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.986\npower requirements, battery life.\n\n236\n00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:51.707\nI wanna be able to charge my battery and\nI wanna be able to use it for a week.\n\n237\n00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:54.542\nNow we know that doesn't happen,\nbut they're working on it, right?\n\n238\n00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:58.637\nYou put one of these screens in one of\nthose devices, and one of the things,\n\n239\n00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.668\nthe processor obviously,\nyour wireless connection, and the display,\n\n240\n00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:06.244\nthree of the power hungry components\nwithin a mobile device, and\n\n241\n00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:10.362\nnow what you've done is you've reduced\nthe overall power requirements.\n\n242\n00:14:10.362 --> 00:14:13.818\nSo small form factor devices\nare really using these a lot.\n\n243\n00:14:13.818 --> 00:14:17.802\nAnd we'll probably only see it\nbecome more and more popular,\n\n244\n00:14:17.802 --> 00:14:23.257\nespecially as they go to I've seen some in\na Consumer Electronics Show there, CES.\n\n245\n00:14:23.257 --> 00:14:27.749\nAnd other places where they actually have\nscreens that are almost the size of like\n\n246\n00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:30.260\na folder,\nlike literally a folder that, and\n\n247\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.967\nthen you can just bend them on each other-\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah bendable.\n\n248\n00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:38.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so yeah, we'll definitely see\nprobably more of that as time goes on.\n\n249\n00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:42.425\nSo that's the LED, that's the one I\nkinda wanted to jump across a couple of\n\n250\n00:14:42.425 --> 00:14:47.210\nthe other technologies we have because\nwe're talking about LEDs in general, and\n\n251\n00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.561\nLCDs, but the other two that\nthey talk about are plasma.\n\n252\n00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:52.663\nPlasma has a good viewing angle.\n\n253\n00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:54.634\nIt's power hungry, very power hungry.\n\n254\n00:14:54.634 --> 00:15:02.112\nIt takes a lot of power to power a plasma\nmonitor, so it's very power hungry.\n\n255\n00:15:02.112 --> 00:15:09.105\nIt could be used for very large\nimplementations, but again very costly.\n\n256\n00:15:09.105 --> 00:15:13.753\nI wouldn't really worry about it\ntoo much pass that for the exam.\n\n257\n00:15:13.753 --> 00:15:15.899\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But just know that it is out there, and\n\n258\n00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:19.763\nthen the other one, which follows zero\nindustry wide standard are projectors.\n\n259\n00:15:19.763 --> 00:15:23.103\nProjectors are uber proprietary now\nthat we've got the Uber out there,\n\n260\n00:15:23.103 --> 00:15:25.137\nmaybe I should say extremely proprietary.\n\n261\n00:15:25.137 --> 00:15:26.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ha-ha,\n\n262\n00:15:26.787 --> 00:15:29.625\nno copyright infringement here [LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:35.134\nBut again, they're extremely proprietary,\nthey typically use some kind of lamp for\n\n264\n00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:40.492\nthe illuminated source, and let's go ahead\nand just move right into brightness and\n\n265\n00:15:40.492 --> 00:15:43.511\nlumens, because when\nyou look at projectors,\n\n266\n00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:48.663\na lot of times that's what they're gonna\nrated in on the quality of the picture.\n\n267\n00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:54.141\nNow every picture, every display,\nis going to have some kind of measurement,\n\n268\n00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:59.049\nbut what's kinda interesting though\nis we talk about brightness, and\n\n269\n00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:01.257\nwhen we talk about brightness,\n\n270\n00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:05.717\nBrightness isn't a measurement\nthat you can take, all right?\n\n271\n00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:06.812\nAnd that's kind of interesting.\n\n272\n00:16:06.812 --> 00:16:07.960\nIt's kind of a misnomer.\n\n273\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.000\nBrightness is something that's\nvery very subjective, right?\n\n274\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.375\nCuz right now, if I was to ask Zach and\nmyself, well, talking to myself,\n\n275\n00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.566\nme, myself, and I,\nare these lights bright?\n\n276\n00:16:18.566 --> 00:16:21.254\nWell, when we first got in here and\nwe first started, yeah,\n\n277\n00:16:21.254 --> 00:16:22.675\nwe would say they're bright.\n\n278\n00:16:22.675 --> 00:16:23.995\nBut we can look at it.\n\n279\n00:16:23.995 --> 00:16:26.125\nI'm sitting here looking at\nthem in the background now, and\n\n280\n00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:28.005\nthey don't bother me at all.\n\n281\n00:16:28.005 --> 00:16:30.750\nYou get somebody that hasn't been in here,\nminus our directors,\n\n282\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.880\ncuz they're in here literally a foot or\nless in front of them,\n\n283\n00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.912\nso how they can even see anything\nanymore is beyond me, right?\n\n284\n00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:40.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So past that,\n\n285\n00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.100\nyou get somebody who\ndoesn't do this everyday,\n\n286\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.520\ncomes into these studios, the first thing,\nmy God, these are bright.\n\n287\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.030\nHow do I measure that?\n\n288\n00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.080\nI can't measure that, all right?\n\n289\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.620\nSo, it's a subjective term that is used to\ndescribe how bright a display is, right?\n\n290\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.990\nBrightness is perceived by the brain.\n\n291\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.960\nIt isn't measured, all right?\n\n292\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.040\nSo we have to be careful with that one.\n\n293\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.180\nLuminance, on the other hand, luminance\nis the intensity of display admitted\n\n294\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.190\nper surface unit area, all right?\n\n295\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.320\nLuminance is an objective term.\n\n296\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.070\nLuminance can be measured, and\nit is measured in lumens, right?\n\n297\n00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.480\nSo this is a measurable term, right?\n\n298\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.210\nLumens, luminance, is something\nthat can be quantified, right?\n\n299\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.690\nAnd that's where we get into lumens,\nright?\n\n300\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.580\nSo they say brightness, they say lumens,\nbut understand that that comes\n\n301\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.090\nfrom luminance, and luminance is\nan objective term that can be measured.\n\n302\n00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.650\nLumens, on the other hand, along with\nthat, is the amount of light output or\n\n303\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.560\nintensity of light produced by a display.\n\n304\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.500\nThe higher the lumens, here we go again,\nthe brighter the display.\n\n305\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.764\nBrighter again is subjective,\nlumens are something we can put a number,\n\n306\n00:17:47.764 --> 00:17:49.420\nwe can put a measurement on.\n\n307\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.610\nAnd you can look at a chart, and I've done\nthis before, and you guys could, too.\n\n308\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.716\nJust Google out there to what\nyou browser is of choice,\n\n309\n00:17:57.716 --> 00:18:03.534\ngo to a search engine and just type in\nprojector specifications, all right?\n\n310\n00:18:03.534 --> 00:18:06.720\nAnd you'll see lamp models and stuff,\ndimensions and stuff like that.\n\n311\n00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.030\nBut a lot of times,\nwhat you'll see is a chart and\n\n312\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.370\nthey'll describe it in lumens, right?\n\n313\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.110\nHow bright the display is.\n\n314\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.510\nBut again, keep in mind that we\nactually have to quantify it.\n\n315\n00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.810\nWe can't just have a subjective\nterm like brightness is, all right?\n\n316\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.260\nNow we have other things, too.\n\n317\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.850\nThey talk about refresh rates and\nframe rates.\n\n318\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.320\nBe careful with this one.\n\n319\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.090\nBecause when we talk\nabout refresh rates and\n\n320\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.600\nframe rates, they are a little\nbit different, all right?\n\n321\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.370\nA refresh rate is how often the screen,\nthe display device itself,\n\n322\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.860\nis repainting the image, all right?\n\n323\n00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.410\nWhat we don't maybe understand fully,\nor maybe we take for\n\n324\n00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.810\ngranted, is the fact that what you are\nlooking at right now isn't a static image.\n\n325\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.920\nIt's not static at all.\n\n326\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.640\nIts actually being repainted,\nredrawn many times over, right?\n\n327\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.570\nThat's why we say 60 hertz,\n120 hertz, 240 hertz, right?\n\n328\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:05.250\nHow many times is that image\nbeing redrawn in one second?\n\n329\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.230\nIf it's 60 hertz,\nit's being redrawn 60 times.\n\n330\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.692\nIf it's 120 hertz, it's 120 times, right?\n\n331\n00:19:13.692 --> 00:19:16.097\nOne of the easiest ways that\nyou can see this is in, and\n\n332\n00:19:16.097 --> 00:19:18.504\nI now you've been in the industry for\na while, Zach,\n\n333\n00:19:18.504 --> 00:19:21.877\nI'm sure you'd see times where they'd\nactually be filming a monitor, or\n\n334\n00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:25.283\nthey'd be filming a TV and you can see\nthe lines in the background, right?\n\n335\n00:19:25.283 --> 00:19:26.603\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n336\n00:19:26.603 --> 00:19:28.045\n&gt;&gt; The video can pick that up.\n\n337\n00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:29.542\nYour naked eye doesn't pick that up.\n\n338\n00:19:29.542 --> 00:19:32.755\nYou have an optical nerve in your\neye that says anything over 60 hertz\n\n339\n00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:36.457\nyour optical eye gets tricked, and\nit's an optical illusion quite literally,\n\n340\n00:19:36.457 --> 00:19:38.540\nthat says, what I see is a static image.\n\n341\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.616\nAnd that's why anything less than 60 hertz\nand actually no longer fool your optical\n\n342\n00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:44.920\nnerve, and\nit can start to give you headaches.\n\n343\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920\nSo, you had to worry about\nthis with the CRT monitors.\n\n344\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.190\nA lot of times, you can't even\nreally set your hertz anymore,\n\n345\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.995\nthat's the refresh rate, all right?\n\n346\n00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:54.100\nThat's different than a frame rate.\n\n347\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.740\nWhy?\n\n348\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.572\nCuz the frame rate is how many frames\n\n349\n00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:04.245\nthe computer is basically sending\n\n350\n00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:08.607\nthat image per second, right?\n\n351\n00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:13.589\nThe refresh rate is a property of\nthe display itself, where the, wait,\n\n352\n00:20:13.589 --> 00:20:15.890\nlet me make sure I say this right.\n\n353\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.170\nThe refresh rate is\na property of the display.\n\n354\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.940\nThe frame rate is a property of the video\nthat's being sent through the display.\n\n355\n00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.860\nDoes that make sense?\n\n356\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.472\n&gt;&gt; I get it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just making sure here-\n\n357\n00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:27.317\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm with you.\n\n358\n00:20:27.317 --> 00:20:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Because frame rate, right?\n\n359\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.265\nSo we say FPS, frames per second, right?\n\n360\n00:20:31.265 --> 00:20:34.330\nThat something could be peaked and tweaked\nin the settings within a computer or\n\n361\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.350\na video game.\n\n362\n00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.680\nWhat it doesn't do is affect the monitor.\n\n363\n00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.160\nIt affects how you view it\nthrough the monitor, but\n\n364\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.440\nthe monitor's refresh rate is\nwhat's being repainted, all right?\n\n365\n00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.100\nSo keep in mind,\nthey are separate things there, all right?\n\n366\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.790\nSo what else do we got here, Zach?\n\n367\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.150\nI know we're kinda coming up on time.\n\n368\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.820\nSome of the other things that we had\ntalk about analog versus digital.\n\n369\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.770\nRight, the majority of your\nvideo today is digital.\n\n370\n00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.690\nHowever, keep in mind,\n\n371\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.150\nthere are still plenty of things\nout there that are analog, VGA,\n\n372\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.520\nvideo graphics array.\n\n373\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.520\nWe talked about that connector\nin another episode, right?\n\n374\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.696\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we did.\n&gt;&gt; Through the accelerated track here.\n\n375\n00:21:06.696 --> 00:21:10.280\nVideo graphics array's an analog signal,\ncomposite video, right?\n\n376\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.688\nComponent video, RGB,\nthose are all analog signals.\n\n377\n00:21:13.688 --> 00:21:19.855\nWe move into digital video interface,\nor digital visual, I wanna say Visio.\n\n378\n00:21:19.855 --> 00:21:22.949\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not a Microsoft product.\n\n379\n00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:28.510\n[LAUGH] DVI is a digital video source.\n\n380\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.990\nWhen we move HDMI,\nhigh definition multimedia interface,\n\n381\n00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.570\nis a digital video source.\n\n382\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.550\nWe move into display port,\nthis is digital video source, right?\n\n383\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.650\nSo just know the difference between\nthe digital and the analog sources and\n\n384\n00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.860\nthe technologies that bring you\nthose different types of sources.\n\n385\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.058\nPrivacy and anti-glare filters, all right.\n\n386\n00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:53.670\nPrivacy and anti-glare filters are a way\nthat we can actually cut the glare out and\n\n387\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.388\ngive a little privacy?\n\n388\n00:21:54.388 --> 00:21:55.494\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n389\n00:21:55.494 --> 00:21:57.610\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, class dismissed, right?\n\n390\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:02.690\nBut what these are, these are overlays\nthat are laid over the monitor, all right?\n\n391\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:07.690\nAnd when they are laid over the monitor,\nessentially you have to stand\n\n392\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.365\nin front of them to be able to see\nwhat is being displayed, right?\n\n393\n00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:14.783\nThey call it anti-glare\nbecause it does exactly that.\n\n394\n00:22:14.783 --> 00:22:19.611\nIt tones down the glare, but privacy\nfilter, they actually call it that because\n\n395\n00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:24.940\nif you move to the side you start to lose\nwhat's actually on the screen, right?\n\n396\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.090\nAnd we actually have one here.\n\n397\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.850\nIn fact, let me go ahead and get that,\nand we'll show that for you.\n\n398\n00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.960\n&gt;&gt; I think I know what\nyou're talking about.\n\n399\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.810\nI've seen them in Enterprise or\nbusiness situations where they\n\n400\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.210\nput them over screens so that you\ncan't see proprietary information.\n\n401\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.760\nIs that right?\n\n402\n00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right, customer information,\nhealth information, a bank, if you will.\n\n403\n00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.360\nIn fact, like I said,\nI got one right here.\n\n404\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.820\nThis is one by 3M, and you can kinda\nsee their little advertisement on it.\n\n405\n00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.040\nBut yeah, it's kinda cool.\n\n406\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.680\nYou can kinda see what goes on here.\n\n407\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.480\nAll right, so if you guys are looking\nright in front, you can see me, but\n\n408\n00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.160\nthe moment I move just to the side.\n\n409\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.860\n&gt;&gt; Where did Wes go?\n\n410\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n411\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.470\nRight, so that's kinda cool,\nthe fact that, and\n\n412\n00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.894\nthat's what they're supposed to do, right?\n\n413\n00:23:02.894 --> 00:23:06.030\nThey are supposed to be to\nwhere if you are standing\n\n414\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.480\nright in front of the screen,\nyou can see it.\n\n415\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.890\nThe moment you move just\nto the side a little bit,\n\n416\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.740\nnow I can't see what's going on, right?\n\n417\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.688\nSo, again, two-fold.\n\n418\n00:23:14.688 --> 00:23:15.355\n&gt;&gt; It's magic.\n\n419\n00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:16.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, they do.\n\n420\n00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.970\nPrivacy, or it can be for\nanti-glare as well.\n\n421\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n422\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.520\ncouple of the other things that they also\ntalk about that I kinda wanna mention.\n\n423\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.060\nThey mention multiple displays.\n\n424\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.969\nI wanna be careful with this\none because multiple displays,\n\n425\n00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.330\nthis isn't a quality of the display,\nall right?\n\n426\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.010\nAnd I kinda disagree on that.\n\n427\n00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.210\nSo here's my pet peeve.\n\n428\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.510\nI've always kinda disagreed\nwith putting multiple displays\n\n429\n00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.110\nunder display device types, right?\n\n430\n00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.980\nHere's why, all right?\n\n431\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.710\nThat display,\nI could have six displays side by side.\n\n432\n00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.400\nThey don't know that there's\none next to the other.\n\n433\n00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.504\nWhat does know is the graphics\ncard that's within the machine,\n\n434\n00:23:56.504 --> 00:24:00.689\nits ability to put out multiple\nstreams of information, right?\n\n435\n00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:02.342\nSo please understand that.\n\n436\n00:24:02.342 --> 00:24:06.794\nIt's a property of a graphics processing\nunit, cuz you could have a graphics\n\n437\n00:24:06.794 --> 00:24:11.112\nprocessing unit that's embedded or\nintegrated into the motherboard, so\n\n438\n00:24:11.112 --> 00:24:16.850\nyou might not have a graphics card, right,\nif we get technical on it too, right?\n\n439\n00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.540\nSo multiple displays is\nhaving more than one display.\n\n440\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.590\nSo I'll mention it here, but I want\nyou to also understand that it is not,\n\n441\n00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.690\nit is not a characteristic of the monitor.\n\n442\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.330\nThe monitor's not self-aware.\n\n443\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.758\nWe are not going, what is it?\n\n444\n00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:31.561\nTerminator here, right?\n\n445\n00:24:31.561 --> 00:24:33.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Skynet, right?\n\n446\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:34.580\n&gt;&gt; It's not AI yet.\n\n447\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.355\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n448\n00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:37.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not Skynet, right?\n\n449\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.083\nIt's not aware,\nit's not self-aware, right?\n\n450\n00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:42.426\nIt's not aware that it's\nnext to one another,\n\n451\n00:24:42.426 --> 00:24:45.870\nit is a property of the video adaptor.\n\n452\n00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.265\nLast thing that I wanna mention here\nis something known as aspect ratio,\n\n453\n00:24:50.265 --> 00:24:52.280\nall right when we talk about.\n\n454\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.700\nAnd I guess we should talk about a couple\nof other things related to resolution.\n\n455\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.290\nI haven't done that, so I'll tell you\nwhat, we'll do one of the basics first.\n\n456\n00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.456\nWe'll do resolution, all right?\n\n457\n00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:02.189\nSo I've got a little diagram\nabout what resolution is, right?\n\n458\n00:25:02.189 --> 00:25:04.746\nYou've probably heard things like for\n\n459\n00:25:04.746 --> 00:25:08.783\ninstance, They had a monitor\nit was 1920 by 1080.\n\n460\n00:25:08.783 --> 00:25:10.864\nWell, what does that even mean?\n\n461\n00:25:10.864 --> 00:25:15.358\nAll right, well,\nthe first number is showing you\n\n462\n00:25:15.358 --> 00:25:19.432\nthe horizontal axis of the monitor, right?\n\n463\n00:25:19.432 --> 00:25:24.082\nHow wide the monitor is,\nversus how tall the monitor is, right?\n\n464\n00:25:24.082 --> 00:25:30.870\nSo the first number is the horizontal,\nhow many pixels in a line horizontally,\n\n465\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:36.890\nversus the second number, which is how\nmany pixels vertically if you will.\n\n466\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.580\nSo resolution is the number of pixels,\n\n467\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.860\nessentially that the monitor will support,\nall right?\n\n468\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.844\nSo if I take 1920 and\nI multiply it by 1080, right?\n\n469\n00:25:48.844 --> 00:25:52.286\nI'll get 2,073,600 pixels.\n\n470\n00:25:52.286 --> 00:25:56.956\nResolution is about how many pixels\nwill fit within that monitor, right?\n\n471\n00:25:56.956 --> 00:26:00.230\nAnd there are many different resolutions.\n\n472\n00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.250\nI'll come back and I'll talk about\na few other common resolutions,\n\n473\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.570\nsome other resolutions\nare just see here in a second.\n\n474\n00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:11.320\nIn the earlier days, you could change\nthe resolution on a CRT monitor and\n\n475\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.230\npotentially get a better quality,\nWith LCD and\n\n476\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.640\nLED screens,\nyou cannot do that, all right?\n\n477\n00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.095\nNow, you could change the resolution,\ndon't get me wrong, and you just say,\n\n478\n00:26:19.095 --> 00:26:20.610\nWell I was,\nchanged the resolution yesterday.\n\n479\n00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.903\nYes, we change the resolutions\non our computers all the time,\n\n480\n00:26:23.903 --> 00:26:26.950\nbut what it doesn't do is\nimprove the resolution.\n\n481\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.940\nAll it does is makes\nthe characters bigger or smaller.\n\n482\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.440\nSee this LCD and LED screens they\nsupport one resolution, right?\n\n483\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.470\nFor quality wise, they support what's\nknown as their native resolution,\n\n484\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.070\nfix resolutions also what they call it,\nnative or fix resolution.\n\n485\n00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.252\nNow that doesn't mean you can't change the\nresolution, but you're not gonna improve\n\n486\n00:26:45.252 --> 00:26:47.800\nthe quality, and that's something\nmake sure you remember, right?\n\n487\n00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.668\nYou're just gonna,\n\n488\n00:26:48.668 --> 00:26:51.640\nif you have icons on your screen\nyou're gonna make them bigger, right?\n\n489\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.170\nYou're not gonna make them clearer, right?\n\n490\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.260\nIn fact, too much so scaling and\nstuffing included in that,\n\n491\n00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.750\nyou can actually make them\nkind of pixellated, right?\n\n492\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.380\nYou're not increasing the amount\nof pixels in that picture at all.\n\n493\n00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.202\nAll right,\n\n494\n00:27:05.202 --> 00:27:11.250\nnow the last thing that I wanna mention\nis something known as your aspect ratio.\n\n495\n00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.960\nAspect ratio when we talk about it,\nit really is a measurement, right?\n\n496\n00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.810\nWhen it comes to aspect ratio\nwe're talking esentially about\n\n497\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.315\na proportional relationship between\nan images width and height.\n\n498\n00:27:24.315 --> 00:27:29.451\nAnd there are three common ones that\nthey call out on the exam here,\n\n499\n00:27:29.451 --> 00:27:31.569\nthey call out 16 by 10.\n\n500\n00:27:31.569 --> 00:27:37.477\nThey call out let's see, 16 by 9,\nand they call out 4.3, all right?\n\n501\n00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:42.375\nNow let me go ahead and I'm gonna start\nout with an older one first, all right?\n\n502\n00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:46.710\nAnd in fact I've got a little diagram\nhere so you can kinda see it, right?\n\n503\n00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.850\nHeight and width of your monitor, right?\n\n504\n00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.060\nWhen we look at this one over here,\nall right, this\n\n505\n00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.240\nis one of the older ones,\n4.3 aspect ratio.\n\n506\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.910\nThis was a long time standard for\ncameras and computer monitors,\n\n507\n00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.990\nit's largely been replaced with a 16\nby 9 aspect ratio because that's\n\n508\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:14.450\nthe international standard today for\nHDTV, high definition TV, all right?\n\n509\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.310\nThere's another one here to and,\nI don't know if I actually put this one in\n\n510\n00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.910\nthe list because again\nmore common is 16 by 9.\n\n511\n00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.287\nAnd that's 16 by 10 they mention.\n\n512\n00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:30.188\nSee, 16 by 10,\nthis was a common tablet aspect ratio, but\n\n513\n00:28:30.188 --> 00:28:32.740\nit kind of fell out of favor.\n\n514\n00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.160\nWhy did it fell out of favor?\n\n515\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.310\nWell, because TVs were being made at 16\nby 9, and the manufacturers realized,\n\n516\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:44.600\nthey're like, well, wait a second,\nif we make TV 16 by 9 and\n\n517\n00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.080\nwe turn around and\nwe make monitor 16 by 9, guess what?\n\n518\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.731\nWe can have the same product and\nwe can market them in two different ways.\n\n519\n00:28:51.731 --> 00:28:52.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.050\n&gt;&gt; And what happens essentially is\n\n521\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.820\nthe manufactures can make both their\nTV's and their monitors the same size,\n\n522\n00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.210\nso 16 by 10 kind of fell out of favor,\nand again it is one that's there.\n\n523\n00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.450\nNow some of the common resolutions\nthat you might see in these, for\n\n524\n00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:11.310\ninstance 16 by 9 I mentioned, you will see\n\n525\n00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:16.760\nthings like 1280 by 720,\n1366 by 768 resolution,1600 by 900.\n\n526\n00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.007\nFull HD is 1920 by 1080.\n\n527\n00:29:21.007 --> 00:29:27.860\nBut remember, now we have 4K UHD,\nwhich is ultra high definition, right?\n\n528\n00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.380\nThat's gonna be your 1920, no,\n\n529\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.528\nactually beyond that, 3840 by 2160.\n\n530\n00:29:35.528 --> 00:29:36.183\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n531\n00:29:36.183 --> 00:29:38.230\n&gt;&gt; Which is absolutely crazy.\n\n532\n00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:45.210\nFull 4,000 ultra high definition is 4096\nx 2304, and believe it or just not for\n\n533\n00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:50.695\nthe exam ,but just to throw it out there\nfor a little bit of fun is full 8k.\n\n534\n00:29:50.695 --> 00:29:53.456\nUltra-high definition and that is,\nare you ready for this one, Zach?\n\n535\n00:29:53.456 --> 00:29:58.690\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n&gt;&gt; This is 8192 by 4608.\n\n536\n00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.930\nYeah, that's insane.\n\n537\n00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.800\nSo, just to kinda give you an idea\nof the 16 by 9 aspect ratio.\n\n538\n00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.610\nAnd again, just remember that proportional\nrelationship between an image's width\n\n539\n00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.800\nand height.\n\n540\n00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.620\nKnow those three for the exam so\nthat you will be doing well,\n\n541\n00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.260\nknow some of the other technologies\nthat we talked about when it comes\n\n542\n00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.850\nto display devices so that
