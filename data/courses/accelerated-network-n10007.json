00:00:08.169\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.749\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.992\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:17.460\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.540\nAnd today we're doing our\naccelerated Comp TIA Network Plus.\n\n8\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.580\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be focusing in on ports and\n\n9\n00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.590\nprotocols.\n\n10\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.920\nAnd here to help us navigate [LAUGH]\nour way to this myriad of acronyms and\n\n11\n00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.790\nport numbers is none\nother than Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.700\nWelcome, Wes.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n\n13\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.070\nthanks for having me, Mike, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.740\nWe're gonna be feeding you guys some\nalphabet soup here really, really quick.\n\n15\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.150\nBut we're gonna hopefully\nhelp you to find, or\n\n16\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.350\nat least eat that alphabet soup too and\nunderstand what we are talking about.\n\n17\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680\nRemember, when we talk about a protocol,\nwhat do we mean?\n\n18\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.280\nWell, we mean a structured set\nof rules for communications.\n\n19\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.840\nRemember, that two end points,\n\n20\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.820\nif they are going to communicate,\nthey have to be sharing the same protocol.\n\n21\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.200\nIt's kind of like language.\n\n22\n00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.100\nI don't speak Spanish, I would love to\nlearn Spanish, but if somebody's speaking\n\n23\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.652\nin Spanish, and I speak in English, we're\nnot gonna have a lot of communication\n\n24\n00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:06.630\n[LAUGH] between us versus somebody\nthat speaks Spanish, right?\n\n25\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.850\nOr to people that speak English, keep in\nmind, that they can have a communications.\n\n26\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.710\nWell, it's kinda interesting,\nyour networks are the same way, right?\n\n27\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.550\nThink of a protocol as a language, right?\n\n28\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.600\nAnd every language has\na set of structured rules\n\n29\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.130\non how they define how you\ncommunicate with that language.\n\n30\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.010\nAnd protocols are the same way.\n\n31\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.040\nNow, when it comes to protocols,\nall right,\n\n32\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.720\nunderstand that we have services\nthat rely on those protocols, right?\n\n33\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.320\nWe have all kinds of things going on,\nwe have name resolution services,\n\n34\n00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.250\nwe've got file protocols that allow us\nto access files across the network.\n\n35\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.170\nWe've got email protocols that will\nallow us to send and receive emails.\n\n36\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.200\nNow, understand as well that\neach one of those protocols can\n\n37\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.900\nuse a different service type, right?\n\n38\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.230\nWe called them protocol types.\n\n39\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.080\nAnd one of the big ones we need to\nunderstand is something known as\n\n40\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.750\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n41\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.400\nNow, I want you to understand that\nTCP Transmission Control Protocol,\n\n42\n00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.790\nit is a connection oriented service.\n\n43\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.560\nNow, it has some overhead,\nbecause of the fact that it brings up,\n\n44\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.340\nit maintains the communication,\n\n45\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.520\ntears that communication down, but it\nalso goes a little bit farther than that.\n\n46\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.000\nWhat it does it takes a larger\namount of data and it breaks it up.\n\n47\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.600\nIt's called segmentation.\n\n48\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.630\nAnd then,\nit also does what's known as sequencing.\n\n49\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.193\nIn fact we've got a little diagram here,\nif you look,\n\n50\n00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:22.929\none of the things that you can keep in\nmind that transmission control protocol,\n\n51\n00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.801\nif you're sending a package, or packet\nin this case from source to destination.\n\n52\n00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:30.876\nIt'll take your information and it'll\nbreak it down into more manageable parts,\n\n53\n00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:35.006\nand what it'll do is it'll sequentially\nnumber these, each one of these packets,\n\n54\n00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.990\nor segments if you will.\n\n55\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.600\nThen, what it does is on the recipient and\nthe destination.\n\n56\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.100\nAnd remember,\n\n57\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.570\nthe transmission control protocol\nis monitoring this the whole time.\n\n58\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.430\nIf one of these packets, notice we have\none, two, three, and, well, I don't know\n\n59\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.570\nwhat happened to four, went out there too.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's missing.\n\n60\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.070\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.030\nWhat would happen is that\nthe destination will call and\n\n62\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.260\nsay, hey, we've got a missing segment\nhere, we have a missing segment four,\n\n63\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.400\nI don't know what happened there.\n\n64\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.940\nCan you resend it?\n\n65\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.740\nAnd then, they call back to the source and\nthe source says, yeah, absolutely,\n\n66\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.730\nhere's segment four, and\nthen the communication starts up again.\n\n67\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.350\nSo, again transmission control protocol,\nconnection orientated reliable service.\n\n68\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.080\nMaintains the communication,\n\n69\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.900\nmake sure that that information gets\nto the end point in a reliable manner.\n\n70\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.120\nAnd that is opposite to what's known\nas the User Datagram Protocol.\n\n71\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.940\nA lot less going on here [LAUGH]\nin this demonstration, right?\n\n72\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.590\nUser Datagram Protocol,\nwhat it allows you to do is,\n\n73\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.400\nit allows you to send information\npotentially a little bit faster,\n\n74\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.090\nbecause it doesn't have the overhead.\n\n75\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.570\nBut one of the things that it lacks\nis that connection oriented service.\n\n76\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.200\nIt's kind of like a best effort delivery.\n\n77\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.698\nKeep in mind that transmission control\nprotocols like getting delivery\n\n78\n00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:44.886\nconfirmation on your\nsnail mail versus UDP.\n\n79\n00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:48.268\nWhich is just kind of like putting it in\nthe blue mailbox and walking away from it,\n\n80\n00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:50.457\nand just hoping it gets to\nthe carriers network, and\n\n81\n00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:52.770\nhopefully to the destination, right?\n\n82\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.640\nSo, each of these have their utilizations,\nright?\n\n83\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.910\nTransmission control protocol,\n\n84\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.920\nwhen I need to make sure that\nthe data is reliably delivered.\n\n85\n00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.860\nUDP, well, when I need to get something\nthere maybe a little bit faster, and\n\n86\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.710\nit can't really tolerate things like slow\ndelivery, because of the overhead that\n\n87\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.320\ntransmission control protocol has.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\n\n88\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.250\n[LAUGH] we got a couple of them.\n\n89\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.800\nAre there any more that\nwe have to worry about?\n\n90\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.940\n&gt;&gt; There's one that is\n\n91\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.570\nkind of interesting, because it's not\nreally connection oriented protocol, but\n\n92\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.490\nit does monitor things like diagnostics.\n\n93\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.884\nWe have what's known as the Internet\nControl Message Protocol, ICMP.\n\n94\n00:04:26.884 --> 00:04:30.990\nAn ICMP is used by a lot of different\nutility software that we have.\n\n95\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.700\nFor instance, as we move into our\ntroubleshooting tools we're gonna talk\n\n96\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.890\nabout utilities like Ping,\nPacket Internet Groper,\n\n97\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.180\nTrace RT, or Trace Route if you're\nin the Nicks Bay Systems, right?\n\n98\n00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.200\nAnd what ICMP does is it allows\nyou to do things like monitor\n\n99\n00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.700\nthe flow of the communications, slow down\nthe flow of those communications, right?\n\n100\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.100\nIf I'm sending information from my\ncomputer to Mike's computer here, and\n\n101\n00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.250\nhis network adapter, for whatever reason.\n\n102\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.620\nMaybe his computer's trying to process\nthat information and it starts saying,\n\n103\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.850\nhey, wait a second, you need to stop,\nI'm gonna start losing packets,\n\n104\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.300\nif you don't slow down, or\nspeed up, I'm waiting a while here.\n\n105\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.710\nSo, Internet Control Message Protocol\nis about.\n\n106\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.010\nThings like Diagnostics controlling\nthe flow of communications and\n\n107\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.710\nwe have different utilities\nthat also use them.\n\n108\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.155\nThere's another one that is\ncompletely connectionless it's not\n\n109\n00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:22.700\nconnection-oriented at all, and\nthat is a very important protocol type and\n\n110\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.010\nthat's called IP that's\nthe Internet Protocol.\n\n111\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.696\nWe're gonna talk pretty extensively\nin other episodes About IP, but\n\n112\n00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:32.050\njust know that it's\nconnection-less service, right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.480\nWe use things if we need connection\nservices with things like addressing,\n\n114\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.270\nthat's why we stack transmission control\nprotocol, on top of things like IP, and\n\n115\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.980\nthen in fact, I guess,\nit would be the other way around, right?\n\n116\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.990\nIP is going to piggyback off of\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n117\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.600\nAnd you'll learn more about that\nwhen we talk about the OSI model.\n\n118\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.640\nAnd these are some of the protocol\ntypes that we need to know that\n\n119\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.830\nall protocols are going to use\nwhen we talk about communications.\n\n120\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.550\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good.\n\n121\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.560\nSo, we got our different protocol types.\n\n122\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.730\nWell, we can classify our protocols\nare either connectionless, or\n\n123\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.590\nconnection oriented.\n\n124\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.120\nNext, I guess, we need to start talking\nabout some of the protocols we need to\n\n125\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.810\nknow for this exam.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n126\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.730\nSo, when we talk about protocols,\n\n127\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.219\nunderstand that some of these we're gonna\ntalk more in depth, in other episodes.\n\n128\n00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.298\nAt this point it's just understand\nwhat the protocol is and\n\n129\n00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:21.070\nhe port number that's\nassociated with them.\n\n130\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.850\nRemember your port, how many possibilities\nof ports you have right 0 to 65,535.\n\n131\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.760\nThey're broken down into three categories\nwhat's known as the well known ports,\n\n132\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.550\nthe registered ports, and then dynamic, or\n\n133\n00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.110\nprivate ports depending on\nwho's material you're reading.\n\n134\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.770\nWhen we talk about well known ports,\nthese are assigned to common services.\n\n135\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.667\nIn fact, every one of the common services\npretty much close, there's a couple\n\n136\n00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:48.584\nregistered services that we'll talk about,\nand that's from 0 to 1023.\n\n137\n00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.290\nRemember that your registered port range,\nright?\n\n138\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.658\nThese are for things like software and\napplications that are kinda\n\n139\n00:06:55.658 --> 00:07:00.579\nrecommendations if you will, and\nthat is from 1024 to 49,151.\n\n140\n00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:06.560\n[LAUGH] The last port\nranges 49,152 to 65,535,\n\n141\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.394\nand these are used by your computers.\n\n142\n00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:11.976\nMike's computer is using them right now.\n\n143\n00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:13.590\nI'm using them right now.\n\n144\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.640\nThey basically identify the end point\nin a temporary communication and\n\n145\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.980\nonce the session is done,\ncommunication is no longer used.\n\n146\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.930\nThey go back over into that pool and your\ncomputer will reuse them as needed for\n\n147\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.920\nadditional communications.\n\n148\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.780\nSo, let's look at some protocols and\nthe ports that are associated with them.\n\n149\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.970\nOne of the first ones I want to talk\nabout here, I've got on the slide and\n\n150\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.790\nthat's known as DNS.\n\n151\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.460\nRemember, domain name\nsystem takes your FQDNs,\n\n152\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.818\nyour fully qualified domain names and\nmaps them to IP addresses.\n\n153\n00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:50.650\nThat is gonna use UDP port 53 if you're\ntalking about simple client queries,\n\n154\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.267\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:56.190\nThen it also has a transmission control\nprotocol, or a TCP oriented port too,\n\n156\n00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.768\nwhich is also port 53.\n\n157\n00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:01.388\nBut that's when two servers are\ncommunicating between them, and you'll go\n\n158\n00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:05.470\non as more advanced, trying to learn\na little bit more about that side of it.\n\n159\n00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:11.263\nSo again, remember, domain name systems,\nDNS is going to be board 53.\n\n160\n00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:12.730\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.470\nNow, Mike, I went ahead, we've got a list\nof them here, different email protocols,\n\n162\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.530\nand I was talking to Mike,\nI was like, hey, let's go ahead and\n\n163\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.410\nput these all in one list.\n\n164\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.350\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe very first one here,\n\n165\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.250\nthat's SMTP,\nsimple mail transfer protocol.\n\n166\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.280\nKeep in mind, this is for\nsending or forwarding email and\n\n167\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.200\nthat does mean from an SMTP client\nas well as between servers too.\n\n168\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.250\nUnderstand that it uses port 25.\n\n169\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.530\nWe also have an oldie, [LAUGH] as well,\n\n170\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.792\nPOPv3, post office protocol version three,\nnotice the arrow here.\n\n171\n00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:51.340\nRemember that this is for receiving email,\nretrieving email off of an email server.\n\n172\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.180\nOne of the limitations was that when you\nwould retrieve that email off the server\n\n173\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.610\nkeep in mind it would erase\nyour email from the server.\n\n174\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.500\nThat's something that we're\nnot really used to today.\n\n175\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.140\nCuz more commonly we connect\nto things like Gmail,\n\n176\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.240\nwe connect to things like Outlook,\nright, Office 365, if you will.\n\n177\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.540\nAnd we manage our emails up on their\nservers, they handle it, right?\n\n178\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.570\nAnd that's where another protocol comes\nin, but I should probably mention the port\n\n179\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.228\nhere, since it's part of the title, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n180\n00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:21.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Post office protocol\n\n181\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.080\nversion three is gonna be port 110,\nand again, retrieving email.\n\n182\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.980\nNow the one that I was talking\nabout was the internet message,\n\n183\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.680\naccess protocol, right?\n\n184\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.410\nIMAP, right?\n\n185\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.241\nWhen we look at the internet mail or\nmessage access protocol.\n\n186\n00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.291\nThis is where you can actually\nconnect to an IMAP server and\n\n187\n00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:41.150\nyou can manage your emails\nright on the server.\n\n188\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.580\nYou can browse through them,\nbrowse through your emails.\n\n189\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.630\nYou can create folders.\n\n190\n00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.750\nYou can group them together.\n\n191\n00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.850\nAnd this is what we\ncommonly use a lot today\n\n192\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.440\nif you're using something like Gmail or\nsomething like Outlook.\n\n193\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.075\nAnd again, it's up in the cloud there.\n\n194\n00:09:54.075 --> 00:09:59.326\nNow I do want you to understand that is\ngoing to be port 143, yeah, port 143.\n\n195\n00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:03.063\nAnd I do want to make mention on\nexam alert here real quick because\n\n196\n00:10:03.063 --> 00:10:05.899\nthere are a couple of these\nports that look like,\n\n197\n00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:09.780\nif you're not careful on\nthe exam you can get them wrong.\n\n198\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.130\nDo not confuse port 443 and port 143.\n\n199\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.270\nWe will get to HTTP coming up, but\n\n200\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.570\nI want you to remember HTTPS\nis what uses port 443,\n\n201\n00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.330\nbut your Internet Message\naccess protocol uses port 143.\n\n202\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.760\nThose ones are always easy.\n\n203\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.190\nAbsolutely on the exam you\nmight tend to get them wrong.\n\n204\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.270\nBut hopefully you will get them right.\n\n205\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.680\nNext one we have is\nwhat's known as Telnet.\n\n206\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.270\nTelnet is an oldie but goodie,\nit's been around for a long time.\n\n207\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.077\nNow remember that there\nare limitations to Telnet.\n\n208\n00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:45.638\nOne of the problems,\nI guess not a limitation but\n\n209\n00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:48.699\none of the problems with Telnet\nis that it allows a terminal\n\n210\n00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:51.843\nemulation software that allows\nyou to make a remote logon.\n\n211\n00:10:51.843 --> 00:10:54.970\nProblem with it is it is\na clear text protocol.\n\n212\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.900\nBecause it's a clear text protocol or\nplain text protocol\n\n213\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.140\nthat means if Mike I'm gonna throw\nthe black hat on him real quick.\n\n214\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.380\nIf Mike's out there and\nhe is doing some packet capturing, right?\n\n215\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.797\nDoing some sniffing on the network.\n\n216\n00:11:05.797 --> 00:11:08.778\nAnd he just happens to\ncatch my log on session or\n\n217\n00:11:08.778 --> 00:11:12.532\nreally anything that's going\non with my Telnet session.\n\n218\n00:11:12.532 --> 00:11:16.110\nHe can rebuild that communication, and\nhe can see exactly what's going on.\n\n219\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.884\nAgain, it isn't encrypted, which is what\nbrings me to our next protocol coming up.\n\n220\n00:11:20.884 --> 00:11:23.731\nRemember that Telnet,\nTelnet operates over port 23.\n\n221\n00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:27.610\nSo know that for the exam.\n\n222\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.938\nNow, one of the things that we used to\nmake remote log ons a little bit more so\n\n223\n00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:35.337\ntoday over Telnet is what's known as SSH,\nSecure Shell.\n\n224\n00:11:35.337 --> 00:11:37.287\nAnd what Secure Shell does,\n\n225\n00:11:37.287 --> 00:11:41.676\nis Secure Shell basically allows\nyou to make the remote log on but\n\n226\n00:11:41.676 --> 00:11:46.888\nit creates an encrypted tunnel and\nwhat that tunnel encryption if you will.\n\n227\n00:11:46.888 --> 00:11:51.152\nWhat that means is now if Mike's out there\nand I make an SSH connection to a device\n\n228\n00:11:51.152 --> 00:11:55.810\nand he's capturing packets here, he's not\ngoing to be able to see the information.\n\n229\n00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.640\nSorry man.\n&gt;&gt; So I am not going to use my name and\n\n230\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.606\npassword anymore.\n&gt;&gt; That's right that's right or\n\n231\n00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:00.679\nmy credit card information.\n\n232\n00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.650\nWhich is probably a good thing, right?\n\n233\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.957\nSo no SSH and know that secure shell,\noperates over port 22.\n\n234\n00:12:06.957 --> 00:12:12.589\nAll right, so the next one that we\ngot here is what is known as SFTP.\n\n235\n00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:17.730\nWe actually have a few\nof the FTP protocols.\n\n236\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.490\nLet me go ahead and\n\n237\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.760\njust mention the first one here\nbefore we get into the encrypted one.\n\n238\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.240\nAll right, so FTP, File Transfer Protocol.\n\n239\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.500\nThis is another one that's an oldie but\ngoodie.\n\n240\n00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.840\nIt's been around a very long time,\n\n241\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.730\nthere's all the way back like\nTelnet back to the days of ARPANET.\n\n242\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.940\nAnd it's highly optimized for\nlarge file transfer.\n\n243\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.231\nIt's a very, very good protocol to use.\n\n244\n00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:42.983\nBut it has limitations as well, and one of\nthose limitations is, again, it's clear\n\n245\n00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:47.537\ntext protocol, so anything that you are\ndoing in between your computer and the FTP\n\n246\n00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:52.422\nserver, transferring files, maybe putting\nsome files up on the server, logging in.\n\n247\n00:12:52.422 --> 00:12:55.190\nAll that information is going to be seen.\n\n248\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.330\nNow, careful with this one because this\nactually has two ports, all right?\n\n249\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:05.620\nAnd, it's really easy sometimes\nto get them mixed up, all right?\n\n250\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.716\nHere's how I always remember it on\nthe exam, data over commands, right?\n\n251\n00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:13.378\nI always remember 20, 21.\n\n252\n00:13:13.378 --> 00:13:18.460\nSo in a list, I always said data's\nright there, 20, 21, data over command.\n\n253\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.210\nSo port 20 for your data transfer,\nport 21 for your commands, right?\n\n254\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.280\nJust little tricks that you need.\n\n255\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.760\nWe accelerated that plus.\n\n256\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.270\nWe like to just give you what you\nneed to get in and get out, and\n\n257\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.270\nhopefully wrap up your training.\n\n258\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:38.780\nNow here's where you can secure FTP and\none of the ways that you can do that.\n\n259\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.490\nCreate an SSH tunnel to the FTP server and\n\n260\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.970\nessentially what you have\nis what's known as SFTP.\n\n261\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.040\nIt's a secure\nShell File Transfer Protocol and\n\n262\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.020\nessentially you're just SSH in\nright into an FTP server and\n\n263\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.150\nagain just like a remote log on a word SSH\ntunnel, people can't tell what's going on.\n\n264\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.330\nIn fact, they can't even tell\nthat you're running FTP.\n\n265\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.730\nYou get out there, and\n\n266\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.160\nyou capture the information,\nall you see is TCP information.\n\n267\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.980\nYou can't tell exactly what's going on.\n\n268\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.540\nAnd that's the beauty of it, right?\n\n269\n00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.338\nIs that you get that secure communication.\n\n270\n00:14:11.338 --> 00:14:15.710\nNow SFTP or FTP in general,\nit's very robust.\n\n271\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.563\nGot a lot of commands, it's got a lot\nof things that you can do with it.\n\n272\n00:14:19.563 --> 00:14:25.990\nBut sometimes you don't need\nall that added overhead.\n\n273\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.167\nAnd you might wanna get a down strip down\nversion for just basic file transfer and\n\n274\n00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:33.095\nmaybe integrity is not really\nsomething that you need,\n\n275\n00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:38.240\nwell that's where something known as the\ntrivial file transfer protocol comes in.\n\n276\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.426\nAnd essentially this is FTP over UDP,\nright?\n\n277\n00:14:41.426 --> 00:14:45.207\nA Trivial File Transfer Protocol and\nthat is over port 69.\n\n278\n00:14:45.207 --> 00:14:48.350\nSo again, keep those in mind too.\n\n279\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.156\nAnd the one that I didn't\nmention is just remember SFTP?\n\n280\n00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:53.090\nIt's port 22.\n\n281\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.401\nI don't know if I mentioned it.\n\n282\n00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:56.218\nAnd I probably didn't mention that.\n\n283\n00:14:56.218 --> 00:14:59.314\nBut one of the great things,\nif you can remember, two protocols, and\n\n284\n00:14:59.314 --> 00:15:02.800\nthey have a single port number on it,\nit's making it easier for yourself.\n\n285\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.090\nSSH port 22, well guess what?\n\n286\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.324\nSFTP, port 22 as well,\nbecause it's going over that SSH tunnel.\n\n287\n00:15:09.324 --> 00:15:12.757\n[CROSSTALK] Okay, so\nMike moving along here,\n\n288\n00:15:12.757 --> 00:15:16.039\nlet's see where we're at,\nnext one is, wow!\n\n289\n00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:17.060\nThis is a good one here.\n\n290\n00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.590\nThis is another one that I know\nMike's over here DNS and DHCP man,\n\n291\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.850\nI know you're probably like, we got so\nmuch we could say about that.\n\n292\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.521\nThis is another very important\ncommunication protocol as well.\n\n293\n00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:30.118\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely we gotta make sure this\n\n294\n00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:32.243\none's working.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\n\n295\n00:15:32.243 --> 00:15:35.673\nso remember DHCP is the dynamic\nhost configuration protocol,\n\n296\n00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:38.920\nand we'll go into it in\nmore in other episodes.\n\n297\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.550\nRemember, host configuration,\nI like to break down the acronyms so\n\n298\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.420\nyou know what's going on.\n\n299\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.189\nThis is about how we get our IP addresses\nin additional host configuration\n\n300\n00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.929\nparameters.\n\n301\n00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:51.854\nBig one that I want you to remember right\nnow is that this is how we can dynamically\n\n302\n00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:56.249\nobtain our IP addresses, and we don't have\nto manually go from computer, to computer,\n\n303\n00:15:56.249 --> 00:15:57.470\nto computer.\n\n304\n00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.082\nAssigning all of the properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n305\n00:16:00.082 --> 00:16:04.880\nKnow that DHCP actually uses two ports,\nuses port 67 and port 68.\n\n306\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.511\nAgain, port 67 and port 68.\n\n307\n00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:11.288\nAll right, moving down the list here,\n\n308\n00:16:11.288 --> 00:16:15.301\nI know we are accelerating down the list.\n\n309\n00:16:15.301 --> 00:16:15.809\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n310\n00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.557\n&gt;&gt; The next one we have here is what is\n\n311\n00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:23.270\nknown as HTTP, all right?\nThat's the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.\n\n312\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.130\nYour web pages are written in HTML,\n\n313\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.160\nhypertext markup language, and what\nhappens is, remember that you have our\n\n314\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.872\nclient server protocols, remember a client\nis, really when we say client server, it's\n\n315\n00:16:33.872 --> 00:16:37.354\ndefined by the software that runs on them.\nI don't care what the device is,\n\n316\n00:16:37.354 --> 00:16:39.610\nif it's requesting a resource,\nit's a client.\n\n317\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.190\nIf it's providing the resource,\nit's a server, right?\n\n318\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.460\nSo when a web browser,\nwhich is the client, makes a request for\n\n319\n00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.393\na webpage from a web server,\n\n320\n00:16:48.393 --> 00:16:53.649\nthe web server delivers that HTML over\nHypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP.\n\n321\n00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:57.386\nThe web browser then renders\nthe webpage and we get the nice,\n\n322\n00:16:57.386 --> 00:16:59.517\nI was gonna say glitter graphics.\n\n323\n00:16:59.517 --> 00:17:00.688\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Boy, that's old.\n\n324\n00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:06.170\nWe get the nice interactive pages that\nwe see when we visit the website.\n\n325\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.650\nThis is another one of those protocols,\n\n326\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.630\nthough, that you have to worry about\nbecause it is also plain text, right?\n\n327\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.360\nSo what do we do?\n\n328\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.490\nWell, we couple this with SSL.\n\n329\n00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.330\nAnd I know some of you that probably\nare preparing for the exam are saying,\n\n330\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.340\nwait a second, SSL, don't you mean TLS?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.431\n&gt;&gt; Well, it depends on what time frame\n\n332\n00:17:24.431 --> 00:17:26.040\nyou're talking about.\n\n333\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.660\nHTTP, again, is the Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol, and if you wanna secure it,\n\n334\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.310\nyou secure it with HTTPS and that is\nHypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL,.\n\n335\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.766\nAnd we'll go into a little bit later\nas to why that actually, today,\n\n336\n00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:42.464\nwe're really using something known as TLS,\nright?\n\n337\n00:17:42.464 --> 00:17:46.020\nAnd I would say it's the successor to SSL.\n\n338\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.850\nAnd it's a lot more\ncryptographically strong than SSL.\n\n339\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.343\nBut for the acronym purposes,\n\n340\n00:17:50.343 --> 00:17:53.680\nkeep in mind Hypertext Transfer Protocol\nover Secure Socket Layer.\n\n341\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.670\nAnd what that allows us to do\nis encrypt the communication.\n\n342\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.828\nMike, I'm not sure that's not\na really good likeness of you bud.\n\n343\n00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:01.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.177\n&gt;&gt; But I went ahead and\n\n345\n00:18:02.177 --> 00:18:03.311\nput Mike up there on the screen.\n\n346\n00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:06.586\nBut what this means is basically\nbetween the web browser and\n\n347\n00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:10.530\nthe server, you can't see\nthe information that's passing, right?\n\n348\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.170\nWe're using that Secure Socket Layer to\ncreate an encrypted communication between\n\n349\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.970\nyou and the web server, so\npeople are none the wiser if\n\n350\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.020\nthey decide that they're gonna\nscrape your information or\n\n351\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.207\ntry to do some packet capture.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we love old HTTPS.\n\n352\n00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:26.850\nI mean, really, that's what allows\nE-commerce to be what it is, right?\n\n353\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it most definitely.\n\n354\n00:18:27.872 --> 00:18:29.631\nI mean, If you think about it,\n\n355\n00:18:29.631 --> 00:18:34.470\nE-commerce probably wouldn't be able to\nhappen if we didn't have HTTPS, right?\n\n356\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.379\nI mean, it is one of the things that\njust drives online business-based\n\n357\n00:18:38.379 --> 00:18:42.170\ncommunications, if we wanna keep\nthem private, that's for sure.\n\n358\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:47.865\nWhen we talk about protocol or the port\nnumbers for these, remember the HTTP and\n\n359\n00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:53.590\nHTTPS, right, they do have two separate\nport values or port numbers, right?\n\n360\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.468\nHTTP is port 80, HTTPS is port 443.\n\n361\n00:18:58.468 --> 00:19:00.455\nAll right, let's see.\n\n362\n00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:03.730\nWe got some other communication types\nthat we need to worry about and as well.\n\n363\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.205\nSNMP is another one out there, this is\nthe Simple Network Management Protocol.\n\n364\n00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:11.015\nAnd this is that protocol that we\n\n365\n00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:15.175\nuse to find out what the current state\nof our network connectivity devices.\n\n366\n00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:17.575\nCould be an operating system,\ncould be a server could be a router,\n\n367\n00:19:17.575 --> 00:19:18.715\ncould be a switch.\n\n368\n00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:21.935\nAnd we use SNMP to collect information,\nand\n\n369\n00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:23.940\neven potentially configure the devices.\n\n370\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:30.650\nSNMP, Simple Network Management Protocol\nis going to be over port 161.\n\n371\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.173\nNow we've got some other protocols.\n\n372\n00:19:32.173 --> 00:19:34.800\nThis one I'd like to kind\nof show you in action.\n\n373\n00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.590\nAnd this is another one of those that\ncould get a little bit tricky on the exam.\n\n374\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.423\nWe have what's known as RDP, and\nI'm gonna go ahead, Mike, and\n\n375\n00:19:45.423 --> 00:19:49.745\nI'm gonna jump ahead here in our list,\ncuz I wanna put them together, cuz\n\n376\n00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:54.713\nport-wise they can get a little confusing,\nsome people can make a mistake on them.\n\n377\n00:19:54.713 --> 00:19:57.060\nRDP is the Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n378\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.858\nAnd when I need to make\na remote connection to another\n\n379\n00:19:59.858 --> 00:20:04.550\nWindows-based operating system,\nI can reach over the network and\n\n380\n00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.960\nI can take control of the desktop, and\nI can view it as though I was sitting\n\n381\n00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.520\nlocally in front of that\ncomputer that I connect to.\n\n382\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.510\nThat connects over port 3389, and\nI do want you to remember that one.\n\n383\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.395\nAnd I wanna compare it back with something\nelse that it's a different protocol, but\n\n384\n00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:22.348\nboy, the port value is really close,\nand that's port 389,\n\n385\n00:20:22.348 --> 00:20:23.950\nthat's something known as LDAP.\n\n386\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.720\nLet me go ahead and show you here,\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n387\n00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.800\nSo to give you an example,\nwe have what's known as an LDAP client.\n\n388\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.544\nAnd it makes a connection,\nso in this case,\n\n389\n00:20:32.544 --> 00:20:35.670\nto what's known as a domain controller\ninside of a Windows Active Directory.\n\n390\n00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.940\nRemember, this isn't\na proprietary communication type.\n\n391\n00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.320\nIf you have a directory service, the way\nyou communicate with it is over LDAP,\n\n392\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.490\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n393\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:50.860\nThe reason I'm putting these two\ntogether is because of port 3389 and\n\n394\n00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.650\nLDAP uses port 389.\n\n395\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.588\nBe careful, there's only one three-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:55.960\n&gt;&gt; That's missing there.\n\n397\n00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.690\nAnd again,\nthese are ones that if you're like me,\n\n398\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.260\nI don't know about you, Mike, but\nif you're a nervous test taker and I am,\n\n399\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.780\nI still am, doesn't matter\nhow many of the exams I take.\n\n400\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.451\nYou can think you know what\nthe question's asking you, and\n\n401\n00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:13.500\nif you click a little bit too quick,\nyou just can't take it back.\n\n402\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.290\nYou're like, that was port 389, not 3389.\n\n403\n00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.556\nNow, sometimes you might need to secure,\nand\n\n404\n00:21:20.556 --> 00:21:24.005\nI might tap the Active Directory\nguru over here.\n\n405\n00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:28.745\nSometimes you need a secure communication\nto your directory services database, and\n\n406\n00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:33.392\nin order to do that you end up\ndoing what's known as LDAP,\n\n407\n00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:36.192\nsecure LDAP essentially, right?\n\n408\n00:21:36.192 --> 00:21:40.036\nLDAPS, and that's over port 636, right?\n\n409\n00:21:40.036 --> 00:21:45.343\nAnd that couples public key cryptology,\nI believe, and allows an encrypted\n\n410\n00:21:45.343 --> 00:21:48.258\ncommunication with a directory server.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n411\n00:21:48.258 --> 00:21:51.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, so remember port 389 for\n\n412\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.740\nLDAP, port 636 for secure LDAP.\n\n413\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.758\nAnd then also remember,\nit's a different protocol, but\n\n414\n00:21:56.758 --> 00:21:59.961\nbecause of the port values,\nRDP, Remote Desktop Protocol,\n\n415\n00:21:59.961 --> 00:22:04.478\nused to make a remote desktop connection\nin a Windows environment, is port 3389.\n\n416\n00:22:04.478 --> 00:22:08.320\nAll right, what else do we got here, Mike?\n\n417\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.950\nWe are going down the list here.\n\n418\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.817\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right on down.\n\n419\n00:22:09.817 --> 00:22:11.448\nWe got a few more to go, I think.\n\n420\n00:22:11.448 --> 00:22:12.765\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely,\n\n421\n00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:14.400\ntime synchronization.\n\n422\n00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.986\nTime synchronization is very important\ninside of your communications,\n\n423\n00:22:17.986 --> 00:22:21.290\nlet alone inside of like\na Windows Active Directory environment.\n\n424\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.210\nTime synchronization is very,\nvery important.\n\n425\n00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.260\nAnd that's where something\nknown as NTP comes in.\n\n426\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.580\nAnd that's the Network Time Protocol.\n\n427\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.250\nWhen your computers need to synchronize,\nin fact I believe your Windows machines,\n\n428\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.190\nwhat happens is when they boot up, they\nactually try to communicate with a time\n\n429\n00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:41.180\nserver out there with Microsoft and\nthey synchronize time as well.\n\n430\n00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.840\nIf you're inside of\na corporate environment,\n\n431\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.960\nyour Windows machines will actually\nreach out to the domain controller and\n\n432\n00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.060\nthey'll coordinate their communication.\n\n433\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.210\nYou guys that are going on to\nmore advanced training will learn\n\n434\n00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.090\nabout something known as a PDC emulator,\nwhich is the master time clock, right?\n\n435\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.420\nIt's the gate keeper, well, I guess\nit's not really the gate keeper, but\n\n436\n00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.900\nit's the master time clock\nwithin a Windows domain.\n\n437\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.560\nAnd it is important that you\nmaintain those communications for\n\n438\n00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.360\nthings like authentication protocols,\nlike Kerberos.\n\n439\n00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.850\nIt's time sensitive, time matters, right?\n\n440\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.564\nSo you're gonna communicate\nsynchronization of your time over NTP.\n\n441\n00:23:10.564 --> 00:23:15.423\nAnd the NTP port, Network Time Protocol,\nthat's gonna be port 1, 2, 3.\n\n442\n00:23:15.423 --> 00:23:16.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:23:16.013 --> 00:23:17.670\n&gt;&gt; I said that for a reason.\n\n444\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.900\n1, 2, 3, you're counting, time, right?\n\n445\n00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.628\n123 is a way to remember it.\n&gt;&gt; Clever.\n\n446\n00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:24.598\n&gt;&gt; So a couple of little things that you\n\n447\n00:23:24.598 --> 00:23:28.830\ncan kinda remember for your exam here.\n\n448\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.764\nAll right, so speaking of time sensitive,\n\n449\n00:23:30.764 --> 00:23:33.220\nhow about some things\nthat we talked about?\n\n450\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.120\nUDP, and we mentioned things like\nUser Datagram Protocol being good for\n\n451\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.880\nvoice over IP communications,\ncuz you need to get it there in real time.\n\n452\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.674\nWell, let's go ahead and stay with our\nvoice over IP communications, right?\n\n453\n00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:48.260\nThere's a couple of protocols\nthat we gotta talk about that\n\n454\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.988\nwe use inside voice over IP.\n\n455\n00:23:49.988 --> 00:23:53.176\nOne of them is known as\nthe Session Initiation Protocol and\n\n456\n00:23:53.176 --> 00:23:55.640\nthe other one is known as H323.\n\n457\n00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.567\nThey both have different ports.\n\n458\n00:23:56.567 --> 00:24:01.880\nAnd in fact SIP, the session initiation\nprotocol, which is responsible for\n\n459\n00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.930\ncommunicating the parameters\nof a communication.\n\n460\n00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.820\nBoy, that's redundant.\n\n461\n00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.590\nFor defining the parameters of\na communication establishing it,\n\n462\n00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.410\nmaintaining it.\n\n463\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.980\nAlmost like transmission control\nprotocol is doing, right?\n\n464\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.000\nAnd then breaking that down.\n\n465\n00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.268\nSession initiation protocol\nuses two ports, all right?\n\n466\n00:24:19.268 --> 00:24:22.569\n50, 60 and\nI don't have anything good for that one.\n\n467\n00:24:22.569 --> 00:24:23.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.600\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's just 5060.\n\n469\n00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.360\nBy the way that's not the two ports.\n\n470\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.566\n50, 60 and then 50,\n61 per session initiation protocol.\n\n471\n00:24:29.566 --> 00:24:34.158\nThe other one that we use in voice\nover IP communications too is\n\n472\n00:24:34.158 --> 00:24:38.677\nthe H323 that uses port 1720,\nagain port 1720.\n\n473\n00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:43.200\nAll right,\nMile let me look through my list here.\n\n474\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.408\nI think [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I see one there SMB.\n\n475\n00:24:47.408 --> 00:24:50.288\n&gt;&gt; SMB, how can we forget our Windows\n\n476\n00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:52.580\ncommunications, right?\n\n477\n00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.120\nMy goodness, so Windows communications,\nwhen I need to make a connection\n\n478\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.230\nto a shared resource within\na Windows environment.\n\n479\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.977\nWe're gonna do that over something known\nas server message block, all right?\n\n480\n00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:08.431\nAnd server message block,\nI know they've got port 145 here.\n\n481\n00:25:08.431 --> 00:25:13.910\nI believe it's got another port too,\nport 139 as well, if I can't remember.\n\n482\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.646\nBut I know it's port 445 when it comes to\nSMB, and I do want you to know that for\n\n483\n00:25:18.646 --> 00:25:19.300\nthe exam.\n\n484\n00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.611\nServer message block again is\nthe way that you make that\n\n485\n00:25:23.611 --> 00:25:28.857\nconnection from say my machine into\nwhether it be a shared folder,\n\n486\n00:25:28.857 --> 00:25:33.090\nwhether it be a printer,\nthose other shares as well.\n\n487\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.360\nShared hard drive,\nwe talk about administrative shares.\n\n488\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.558\nThe way you connect to that is over\nserver message bot with port 445.\n\n489\n00:25:39.558 --> 00:25:42.150\nI don't know why for\nthe life of me I'm thinking port 149.\n\n490\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.600\nI think that's SMB over net BIOS if I\nremember, but another protocol that you\n\n491\n00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.980\ndon't have to worry about for another\ntime that we'll definitely mention.\n\n492\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.912\nBut these are some [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:25:50.912 --> 00:25:52.626\n&gt;&gt; Of the rules for communications,\n\n494\n00:25:52.626 --> 00:25:56.642\nwhat we use them for, the service types if\nyou will as well as their port numbers,\n\n495\n00:25:56.642 --> 00:25:58.135\nand if you can remember them.\n\n496\n00:25:58.135 --> 00:26:00.780\nShould be doing good for\nyour Net plus exam.\n\n497\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.490\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, great look there.\n\n498\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.840\nWe thank you for that nice list of\nall these different protocols, and\n\n499\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.410\nassociated port numbers that we need\nto know for our exam, as well as taking\n\n500\n00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.060\na look at what the different protocols\nare used for, and the protocol types.\n\n501\n00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.010\nRemember, we talked about\nconnection-oriented protocols,\n\n502\n00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.970\nversus connectionless protocols.\n\n503\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.120\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n504\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.390\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n505\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.390\nSigning off for ITPRoTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n506\n00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n507\n00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.023\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n508\n00:26:26.023 --> 00:26:33.742\n[MUSIC]\n\n509\n00:26:33.742 --> 00:26:35.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRoTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.059\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.194\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:11.526\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n6\n00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:15.340\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.470\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n8\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.110\ntoday we're doing our\nAccelerated CompTIA Network+.\n\n9\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.820\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be taking a close look at\n\n10\n00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.660\nthe OSI model.\n\n11\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.720\nAnd here to guide us through\nthe different layers is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.340\nWelcome, Wes.\n&gt;&gt; Hey how are you doing, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.910\nI don't know if we'll ever have a show\nthat doesn't have an acronym right\n\n14\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.591\nin the title.\n\n15\n00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.482\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking the same thing.\n\n16\n00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:39.047\nSo that's right, we are looking at\nthe open systems interconnection model.\n\n17\n00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:43.770\nRemember that it is a seven layer\nabstract computing architecture,\n\n18\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.770\nif you will, that basically defines\nhow communications will travel\n\n19\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.400\nfrom an application until finally making\ntheir way out on the physical cable.\n\n20\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.650\nThose electrical impulses we see.\n\n21\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.200\nWhether we're using bounded media or\nradiated energy and\n\n22\n00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.560\nwe need to know those individual layers.\n\n23\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.730\nRemember it was actually\nstarted back in I think,\n\n24\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.030\n1984 by the International Organization\nof Standardization, right?\n\n25\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900\nIn those earlier days, keep in mind that\neverybody was trying to do things their\n\n26\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.290\nown way and they said, you know what?\n\n27\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.190\nIf everybody's doing something their own\nway that means you're going to get vendor\n\n28\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.950\nlock and there's going to be no\ninner operability between these\n\n29\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.330\ndifferent networks and\nlocal area networks if you will.\n\n30\n00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.390\nSo they came up with\na standardized approach.\n\n31\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.630\nAnd we need to know a little bit about\neach one of those seven abstract layers.\n\n32\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.440\nI actually have a little diagram here and\n\n33\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.820\nwe can talk about each\none of these in general.\n\n34\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.720\nWhen we talk about seven layers it really\ndepends on whether you're sending or\n\n35\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.890\nreceiving communication as to where you\nstart within what they call protocol\n\n36\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.900\nstack, right.\n\n37\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.090\nWe'll talk in other episodes about\nwhat's known as TCP/IP model as well,\n\n38\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.210\nbecause it's also a layered model that\nwe really follow for the internet today.\n\n39\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990\nBut understand that when\nyou hear protocols stack\n\n40\n00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.750\nwe're looking at the layers\nof the OSI model.\n\n41\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.193\nNow let's go ahead, we're gonna start from\nthe top layer and we'll work our way down\n\n42\n00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:10.315\nto the floor, we'll work our\nway down to the bottom layer.\n\n43\n00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:14.950\nAll right you'll hear me use these\nterms interchangeably too so\n\n44\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.490\nyou'll have to keep up, keep in mind\nthat we all in the accelerated Net Plus.\n\n45\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.110\nIf you want more information\ndefinitely go back and\n\n46\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.130\ncheck out our full Network Plus episodes.\n\n47\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.240\nSo in the very first one we have\nwhat's known as the application layer.\n\n48\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.710\nThat's Layer 7 of the OSI model.\n\n49\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.130\nWe then have the presentation layer,\nLayer 6.\n\n50\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.890\nWe have the session layer, Layer 5.\n\n51\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.030\nTransport layer is Layer 4.\n\n52\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.750\nWe have the network layer,\nwhich is Layer 3.\n\n53\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.020\nData link layer, well, that's Layer 2.\n\n54\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.980\nBut it's actually broken\nup into two sub-layers that\n\n55\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.500\nwe'll talk about here in a second.\n\n56\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.630\nAnd then physical layer, Layer 1.\n\n57\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.470\nAll right so let's go ahead and\ngo back up to the top and\n\n58\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.540\nlet's talk about the very first\none here all the way at the top.\n\n59\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.440\nLet's talk about\nthe application layer first.\n\n60\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.400\nThe application layer is really\nwhat allows our applications and\n\n61\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.290\nprograms is the ability to even\nhave access to the network, right?\n\n62\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.330\nWe have a lot of different protocols,\nnow please understand there are tons of\n\n63\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.280\nprotocols, I just gave you\nsome as examples here.\n\n64\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.230\nFor instance,\nwe have email applications, right?\n\n65\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.540\nWe have email protocols.\n\n66\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.130\nThese sit at the application layer.\n\n67\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.500\nWe have things like file access protocols,\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n68\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.460\nI just put FTP here.\n\n69\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.470\nBut network file system is\nanother one that would sit here.\n\n70\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.980\nIn our Windows machine, Samba,\nor not Samba, excuse me,\n\n71\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.820\nSMB would sit up here at\nthe application layer.\n\n72\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.520\nAnd it's really the entry point\ninto the network communication.\n\n73\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.300\nThat's why we have things like DNS,\nHTTP as well.\n\n74\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.920\nNow, the application layer,\n\n75\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.160\nonce our data has access to the network,\nnow what we have to do is we have to start\n\n76\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.805\nformatting it in a way that we\ncan place it on the network.\n\n77\n00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:52.160\nAnd the network doesn't\nhave to worry about that,\n\n78\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.590\nthe network can worry about moving the\ninformation from end point to end point.\n\n79\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.170\nAnd, that's where you\nsometimes might even hear,\n\n80\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.210\nI've actually heard the presentation\nlayer before called the syntax layer.\n\n81\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.860\nWe don't usually call it that, but\nthey say syntax because what's it doing?\n\n82\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.440\nIt's formatting your information,\ncompressing your information data,\n\n83\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.720\nencryption happens here.\n\n84\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.690\nAgain, so it's preparing that information.\n\n85\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.150\nI think of it as like,\nI need to send a letter in the mail.\n\n86\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.850\nWell, I've got my letter, right?\n\n87\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.430\nThink of the application layer,\nI just wrote my letter.\n\n88\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.650\nWell, I need to start getting it prepared\nto put on the carrier's network, so\n\n89\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.040\nI need an envelope, right?\n\n90\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.360\nThen once I put it in an envelope,\n\n91\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.540\nnow I've got it formatted in\na way that here in the States\n\n92\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.670\nour United States Postal Service is gonna\nunderstand that's a snail mail letter.\n\n93\n00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.170\nAt least we understand what it is,\nwe don't know where it's going yet, but\n\n94\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.740\nwe do understand what it is.\n\n95\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.130\nAnd, so that's Layer 6.\n\n96\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.030\nMoving down the layers,\nif we look at Layer 5, the session layer.\n\n97\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.010\nNow, the session layer is responsible for\nestablishing the communication, right?\n\n98\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.810\nDefining what are the parameters,\nhow are we going to communicate, right,\n\n99\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.324\nbetween endpoints, right?\n\n100\n00:04:58.324 --> 00:05:02.240\nMaintaining those communications and, one\nI just kind of ran out of room here for\n\n101\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.040\nis, actually terminating the\ncommunication, once it's no longer needed.\n\n102\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.490\nNow, I will tell you,\n\n103\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.020\nnotice that we have transmission\ncontrol protocol, a lower layer.\n\n104\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.270\nWell, transmission control protocol\nactually works on a couple of these layers\n\n105\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.720\nwhen you look at it, because it's\na connection oriented service.\n\n106\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.180\nIf you remember from our ports and\nprotocols episode that we did,\n\n107\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.550\nwe talked about transmission control\nprotocol bringing that communication\n\n108\n00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.750\nonline establishing\na connection oriented service.\n\n109\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.550\nMaintaining that service and\nthen tearing it down.\n\n110\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.069\nWell guess what, transmission control\nprotocol has it's functionality sitting at\n\n111\n00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.332\nsession layer as well.\n\n112\n00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:39.290\nKind of ran out of room,\ndidn't put it up there.\n\n113\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.680\n[LAUGH] And\nthen as we move down the stack here,\n\n114\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.520\nyou'll see that Layer 4 is going to be\nwhat's known as the transport layer.\n\n115\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.010\nNow the transport layer, and\nlet me go ahead, and I'll tell you what,\n\n116\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.430\nI'll stop right here.\n\n117\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.840\nI want to look at the application\npresentation and session layer.\n\n118\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.370\nThis is what's known as\nthe application functioning block.\n\n119\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.380\nAnd what it's about is, it's really\nabout preparing your information to be\n\n120\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.290\nplaced onto the network, if you will.\n\n121\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.360\nAnd if they ever ask you that on the exam,\n\n122\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.490\nwhich is the application functional block,\nI got a little trick for you.\n\n123\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.640\nIt's spelled right in the first letters,\nright there,\n\n124\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.090\nAPS, if you can remember that,\napplication function block, APS,\n\n125\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.670\nright there, kind of one of\nthose little tricks that you can\n\n126\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.110\nkind of remember it on the exam.\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n127\n00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.640\nhandy.\n&gt;&gt; But once we get to the transport down\n\n128\n00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.630\nnow we're talking about\nthe network functioning block.\n\n129\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.220\nBecause now we have the network\nis going to be responsible for\n\n130\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.440\ngetting this communication.\n\n131\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.760\nWe have our envelope, right?\n\n132\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.710\nIt's ready, we know,\ndo we need delivery confirmation,\n\n133\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.590\ndo we need best effort delivery, right?\n\n134\n00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.580\nWell that's where we're going to make\nthose selections at the transport layer.\n\n135\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.060\nWhat kind of connection?\n\n136\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.330\nDo we even need a connection or\nis it service as well?\n\n137\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.130\nSo, understand that if it's a session\nlayer communication and using UDP,\n\n138\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.170\nthere might not be\na session establishment.\n\n139\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.680\nRight?\nSo, just keep that in mind, too.\n\n140\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.390\nSo, at the transport layer, this is where\nyou're actually moving your information.\n\n141\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.910\nYou're choosing how you're gonna move\nthat information along the network.\n\n142\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.650\nSo transmission control\nprotocol sits here too.\n\n143\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.290\nBoth UDP and TCP, they move information.\n\n144\n00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.380\nThey do it a little bit different.\n\n145\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.780\nIf it's transmission control protocol,\nunderstand that its doing segmenting and\n\n146\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.660\nsequencing, like we talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n147\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.110\nIt happens at the transport layer,\nor Layer 4 of the OSI model.\n\n148\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.510\nAll right,\nnow we get down to the Networking layer.\n\n149\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.590\nAll right, and\nthis is everybody's fun layer too,\n\n150\n00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.100\nespecially when things go wrong, right?\n\n151\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.990\nWhen things go wrong,\n\n152\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.220\nit's gotta be the network's fault.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, always.\n\n153\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.910\n&gt;&gt; Layer 3, that's right.\n\n154\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.460\nLayer 3 of the OSI model\nnetwork layer here.\n\n155\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.170\nThis is where we get things like IP.\n\n156\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.920\nWe've got our envelope, right?\n\n157\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.400\nWe've kind of determined, hey, do I want\na connection oriented service, right?\n\n158\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.560\nDo I want deliver confirmation,\nreturn, receipt?\n\n159\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.560\nOr do I just want to put the snail mail in\nthe blue box and walk away from it, right?\n\n160\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.057\nBut whatever choice I make, I still got\nto figure out where is it coming from and\n\n161\n00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:56.773\nwhere is it going to, right?\n\n162\n00:07:56.773 --> 00:07:58.893\nWell, and it's more important\nas where it's going to,\n\n163\n00:07:58.893 --> 00:08:00.714\ncuz that's the purpose of networking,\nright?\n\n164\n00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.716\n[LAUGH] Is to send a communication.\n\n165\n00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:06.232\nBut think about your letter, right?\n\n166\n00:08:06.232 --> 00:08:10.630\nYou have a mailing address and\nyou have a return address, right?\n\n167\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.150\nSo the source and\ndestination of this snail mail.\n\n168\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.920\nWell, guess what?\n\n169\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.220\nHere at the network layer, you have source\nand destination of your communication.\n\n170\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.110\nAnd what is doing that for us?\n\n171\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.200\nIP, Internet protocol, right?\n\n172\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.170\nWe also have other things that operate\nat this layer too, like for instance,\n\n173\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.410\nsome of our routing protocols.\n\n174\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.190\nI mentioned some of them here in our\nslide, things like open shortest path\n\n175\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.360\nfirst, routing information protocol and\nits successor rip version two.\n\n176\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.990\nThings like ISIS, if you will,\nIntermediate System Intermediate System,\n\n177\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.760\nBGP, all these routing protocols, right?\n\n178\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.880\nThese are what allow our routers to\nlook at the destination IP address and\n\n179\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.750\ndetermine how we're gonna send that\ninformation or how we're gonna choose\n\n180\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.420\nthe best path to send that information\nalong the network, all right?\n\n181\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.268\nNow, we get to one that's sometimes\na little confusing, right?\n\n182\n00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.591\nAnd this is what's known as the Data-Link\nlayer and i know my head's kinda\n\n183\n00:08:57.591 --> 00:09:01.250\ncovering it up here but the Data-Link\nlayer's actually broken into two layers.\n\n184\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.590\nThere was a certain time when they said,\nwell,\n\n185\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.100\nthe data link layer's doing a little bit\nmore than what we originally defined.\n\n186\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.220\nSo we need a way to kind of\ndifferentiate what's going on here.\n\n187\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.496\nSo they broke it up into two sub layers.\n\n188\n00:09:11.496 --> 00:09:16.010\nAnd actually the IEEE got involved and\nsaid hey, we're even gonna put one of\n\n189\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.690\nour 802 numbers on it too and\nthat's the logical link control, LLC.\n\n190\n00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.890\nIt's responsible for\nthings like flow control if you will,\n\n191\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.870\nit's what sends out acknowledgements and\nwhen I say acknowledgements at layer two.\n\n192\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.520\nWe're talking about switches, right?\n\n193\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.510\nWell, we'll come back to that.\n\n194\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.420\nWe wanna talk a little bit\nabout some of these devices and\n\n195\n00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.660\nwhere they work in relation Mike,\nto the OSI model here.\n\n196\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.262\nLLC, Logical Link Control is responsible\nfor things like your flow control,\n\n197\n00:09:42.262 --> 00:09:46.866\nsending out acknowledgements, error\ndetection and notification as well and\n\n198\n00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:52.164\nthen the next one is something called MAC\nand that's the Media Access Control layer.\n\n199\n00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:56.033\nI mentioned the 802, I say hey,\nthey put their 802 stamp on LLC and\n\n200\n00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.012\napparently, you have to Google it.\n\n201\n00:09:58.012 --> 00:09:59.173\nNo, [LAUGH] just kidding.\n\n202\n00:09:59.173 --> 00:10:03.303\nIt's 802.2 is the IEEE.\n\n203\n00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:06.270\nRemember, the institute for\nelectrical and electronic engineers.\n\n204\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.190\nWe're gonna throw some of those\n802 terms in the full net plus and\n\n205\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.890\nthe accelerated net plus as well and\nyou need to know them for the exam.\n\n206\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.019\nYou never know when they're gonna\nget you with those standards.\n\n207\n00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:21.536\nThey're easy questions to write but if\nyou're a studying forum, they're also easy\n\n208\n00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:25.255\nquestions to get right really quick or\nto write and get right, right?\n\n209\n00:10:25.255 --> 00:10:27.723\n[LAUGH] If you're the SME,\nthe subject matter expert,\n\n210\n00:10:27.723 --> 00:10:31.158\nif you're writing the questions and\nwell, if you're the exam candidate,\n\n211\n00:10:31.158 --> 00:10:33.590\nhopefully, you're getting\nthem right on the exam.\n\n212\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.040\nThe next one is the sub-layer\nof the data-link layer.\n\n213\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.430\nThat is media access control of the Mac\nlayer, is actually what's responsible for\n\n214\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.070\nthings like our carrier-sense, right?\n\n215\n00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.680\nWe'll talk about network\ntraffic properties, right?\n\n216\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.620\nAnd we had the carrier-sense\nmultiple access collision detection.\n\n217\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.230\nThe ability of that device or\nthat network adapter to listen out, hey,\n\n218\n00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.180\nis the wire, is the network available?\n\n219\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.150\nOr that happens at the Mac layer,\nthe Mac layer is responsible for\n\n220\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:04.120\ndoing that, as well as attaching things\nlike your media access control addresses.\n\n221\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.390\nNow, we put them in this\norder because remember,\n\n222\n00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.480\nthe network layer is gonna\ncommunicate with the LLC, and\n\n223\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.712\nthen the physical layer\ncommunicates with the Mac layer.\n\n224\n00:11:13.712 --> 00:11:19.060\nThey're putting an order for that reason,\nso definitely know that on the exam.\n\n225\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.160\nNow, we get the physical layer.\n\n226\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.470\nAnd again, I know it's layer one here,\nyou'll have to take my word of it cuz my\n\n227\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.870\nbig head is covering it up again.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.360\nAnd that's right, that's the,\nlayer one is the physical layer,\n\n229\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.070\nthis what we are talking about.\n\n230\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.880\nDefining things like the hardware,\nelectrical and mechanical characteristics\n\n231\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.550\nand what I mean by that is not just\nthe physical media cuz remember,\n\n232\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.230\nwe have two different types of media.\n\n233\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.060\nRight, we have bounded media,\nwhich is using typically\n\n234\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.450\nsome copper electrical communication or\nan optical light source over fiber.\n\n235\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.990\nBut remember, we also have\nunbounded communications, too.\n\n236\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.460\nWe have radiated energy,\nwhether it be Wi-Fi, whether it be NFC,\n\n237\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.950\nwhether it be satellite,\namped if you will, wave.\n\n238\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.080\nAll those crazy wireless communications or\nbluetooth if you will.\n\n239\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.610\nIt's all wireless media, right?\n\n240\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.940\nSo, now we're talking about when we\nreceive information down at the physical\n\n241\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.570\nlayer, we're talking about\nelectrical impulses, right?\n\n242\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.932\nWe're talking about the binary bits,\nthe raw bits and\n\n243\n00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:16.673\nthey are going to be set out onto\nthe wire to the destination.\n\n244\n00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:19.683\nAll right Mike, so boy, I tell you what,\nthat's a lot of information when it comes\n\n245\n00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:21.208\nto the OSI model.\n&gt;&gt; It is a ton.\n\n246\n00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:22.715\nAnd so I've got to remember,\n\n247\n00:12:22.715 --> 00:12:25.750\nwe need to know what each one\nof those layers is,all right?\n\n248\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.000\nWhat occurs at those different layers.\n\n249\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.350\nAnd very important to understand\nthe order of those layers as well.\n\n250\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.660\nIs there a way that you could\nhelp us remember how those go?\n\n251\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n252\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.370\nI've got a pneumonic that\nI've always remembered.\n\n253\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.540\nIf you remember, application.\n\n254\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.750\nSo all people seem to\nneed data processing.\n\n255\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.070\nThat's how I remembered it,\nis again, application.\n\n256\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.410\nAll people presentation, seem to need.\n\n257\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.440\nI forgot an S in there.\n\n258\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.970\nAll people seem to need data\nprocessing will be those seven layers.\n\n259\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.598\nI was going to say,\nif I don't get the seem in there,\n\n260\n00:12:56.598 --> 00:12:58.892\nthey're going to be like well, wait\na second, is this a six layer model or\n\n261\n00:12:58.892 --> 00:13:00.030\na seven layer model?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n262\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.520\nBut so yeah, and remember that on\nthe exam and you will be doing good.\n\n263\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.140\nNow, there are some other things\nthat we need to remember too,\n\n264\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.110\nnot just what Mike has\njust said here as well but\n\n265\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:13.880\nI want to start just showing you like the\nlayers that certain devices work at too.\n\n266\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.760\nSo if we can take a look\nback at my slide here,\n\n267\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.100\nI'm gonna go back over each one of\nthese layers relatively quickly here.\n\n268\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.512\nAnd we're gonna look at some of\nthe things that can be going on at these\n\n269\n00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:24.230\ndifferent layers.\n\n270\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.710\nLike for instance,\napplication layer, that's your host.\n\n271\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.040\nYour host, you're communicating over.\n\n272\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.680\nA host communication is happening\nover the application layer.\n\n273\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.140\nBut there are others, as we go on,\n\n274\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.990\nthat you are going to learn about things\nlike next generation firewalls, right?\n\n275\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.300\nThey are smart enough to know\nwhat the application data is,\n\n276\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.740\nthey can look in that information,\nthey could see what is going on.\n\n277\n00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.660\nAnd they can operate at the presentation\nlayer, the session layer likewise.\n\n278\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.820\nWhen we're doing staple\npacket inspection too,\n\n279\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.030\nwe've got to be able to see\nthat session layer information.\n\n280\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.950\nWell, the next-generation\nfirewalls are very, very smart.\n\n281\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.950\nSometimes, you might even hear, sometimes,\n\n282\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.530\nI've heard them called application layer\nfirewalls too but really, with the next\n\n283\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.830\ngeneration firewall, it's not stuck at\nthe application, it can do all of them.\n\n284\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.016\nAnd then same thing with Presentation and\nSession layer.\n\n285\n00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:14.391\nTransport, all right, when we talk about\nTransport layer, all right, gateways,\n\n286\n00:14:14.391 --> 00:14:15.441\ngateways operate.\n\n287\n00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:19.863\nNow, be careful because I'm not talking\nabout a default gateway which is an IP\n\n288\n00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:24.084\naddress basically to the router that\nallows you to route traffic off of your\n\n289\n00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:25.296\nlocal area network.\n\n290\n00:14:25.296 --> 00:14:29.795\nWhen I talk about a gateway in this\naspect, I'm talking about something that\n\n291\n00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:34.470\nbasically translates data between\ntwo dissimilar protocols, right?\n\n292\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.330\nOne that we never really talked\nabout because the way history\n\n293\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.500\ngoes Nobel kind of went by the wayside but\nif you had an IPX SPX on one side and\n\n294\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.200\nyou had TCPIP on the other,\nthey're incompatible.\n\n295\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.690\nThey're not compatible, right,\nwhen it comes to protocol suite.\n\n296\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.610\nSo you would need a translational\nsystem in between them and\n\n297\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.970\nthat's what a gateway device does.\n\n298\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.610\nIt translates between two\ndissimilar protocols, so\n\n299\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.060\nthat the communication can happen.\n\n300\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.090\nNext, on layer three, we have networking.\n\n301\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:05.470\nNetworking, next on network layer,\nlayer three, we have routers, all right?\n\n302\n00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.160\nAnd I'll layer put three switches here and\nI'll explain what I mean here in a second.\n\n303\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.910\nRouters.\n\n304\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.960\nRouters deal with IP,\nthey deal routing protocols.\n\n305\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.883\nThey operate at layer three.\n\n306\n00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:17.328\nNow, I said a layer three switch,\nwhat do I mean by that?\n\n307\n00:15:17.328 --> 00:15:21.230\nYou might hear it called multi-layer\nswitch too, just generically.\n\n308\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.430\nA lot of times in networking,\n\n309\n00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.360\nwe just call them layer three\nswitches because they understand IP.\n\n310\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.231\nDo not let that confuse\nyou because switching,\n\n311\n00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:34.890\nwhen we talk about, there we go,\nthe right slide there.\n\n312\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.750\nWhen we talk about switching and I know\nmy head is kind of covering it up here.\n\n313\n00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.500\nSwitches operate at layer two.\n\n314\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.890\nAll switching, when they're dealing with\nMac addresses and frames if you will,\n\n315\n00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.150\nthat happens at the data-link layer.\n\n316\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.690\nBut switches can be intelligent\nenough that they also\n\n317\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.090\nunderstand routing protocols.\n\n318\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.780\nNow that doesn't mean that switching\nis going to move up to layer there.\n\n319\n00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.314\nSwitching still happens at layer two,\ndata link layer.\n\n320\n00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:01.026\nThis means that the switch\nunderstands IP addresses, source and\n\n321\n00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:02.653\ndestination IP addresses.\n\n322\n00:16:02.653 --> 00:16:05.893\nUnderstands what a routing protocol is,\nif you will.\n\n323\n00:16:05.893 --> 00:16:09.851\nAnd that's why sometimes you'll hear\nthem called multi-layer switches.\n\n324\n00:16:09.851 --> 00:16:13.310\nNow the other one that we have here\nas well is the physical layer.\n\n325\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.890\nAnd that's again Layer 1 down here.\n\n326\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.560\nAnd this is where we have things\nlike hubs and repeaters, right.\n\n327\n00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.920\nIf you look at a hub, what is a hub doing?\n\n328\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.450\nWell it's just repeating your information.\n\n329\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.560\nIt's almost like a repeater, but\nwhat it does is it's hard wired.\n\n330\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.490\nIt doesn't understand logic.\n\n331\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.470\nIt doesn't understand frames,\ndoesn't understand IP addresses.\n\n332\n00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.540\nIt receives information and\nregenerates it.\n\n333\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.040\nThrows it out.\n\n334\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.630\nThe raw bits out all of its ports.\n\n335\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.760\nIt's a dumb device essentially.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.810\n&gt;&gt; Repeaters.\n\n337\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.850\nWhat is a repeater doing?\n\n338\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.250\nIt's receiving an electrical signal,\nit's regenerating it, and\n\n339\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.160\nallowing it to continue further than\nwhatever the transmission media might be\n\n340\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.630\nrated for or\naccording to what the standard is, right?\n\n341\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.270\nWhile also to extend the communication,\n\n342\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.720\nbeyond what the distance of\na standardized cable might be.\n\n343\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.690\nYou've probably seen it more commonly\ntoday, if this is your first endeavour\n\n344\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.270\ninto networking into things like range\nextenders in your WIFI networks, right?\n\n345\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.340\nThat's an unbounded repeater, right?\n\n346\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.950\nSame concept, it's just not sending\nan electrical signal down a cable,\n\n347\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.870\nregenerating it and\nsending it on it's way and\n\n348\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.830\nI'm saying electrical signal, because\nit could be a fiber optic signal too.\n\n349\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.070\nThere's fiber optic repeaters as well,\njust as much as there's copper signal\n\n350\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.560\nrepeaters too like in your\nethernet connections.\n\n351\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.680\nBut they're also in WiFi too.\n\n352\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.810\nThen you have things like modems.\n\n353\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.860\nWhat is a modem?\n\n354\n00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.230\nWell a modem is taking the electrical\nsignal and it's either modulating or\n\n355\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.840\nit's demodulating the signal.\n\n356\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.530\nIt is there too.\n\n357\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.600\nThen the next one is\na Network Interface Controller, NIC right?\n\n358\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:44.070\nNow, this is where the debate comes\nbecause network adapters, NIC, right?\n\n359\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.260\nNetwork Interface Controllers actually to\nme they operate on a couple of layers.\n\n360\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.100\nwhy?\n\n361\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.670\nwell you plug a physical\ncable into them right.\n\n362\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.800\nYou plug a physical cable into them and\nit's got a transceiver chip it's dealing\n\n363\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.290\nwith raw bit so\nit is operating on the physical layer.\n\n364\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.740\nBut then it also understands\nthings like ethernet.\n\n365\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.310\nwhich ethernet operates\nat two layers as well.\n\n366\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.020\nIt defines the electrical characteristics\nas well as Mac addressing.\n\n367\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.231\nAnd that communication that\nhappens at data-link layer.\n\n368\n00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:12.750\nSo you can kind of see that they\nsit on two different layers.\n\n369\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.320\nAnd we could go for\nhours on which one [LAUGH] it might be.\n\n370\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.130\nI'm putting them at physical here,\n\n371\n00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.950\njust because of the physical cable\nthat's plugged into them, too.\n\n372\n00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.170\nBut understand that they do have aspects\nthat operate on two layers, too.\n\n373\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.010\nOne of the last things I want to talk\nabout with the OSI model here is just\n\n374\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.430\nthe process of what is going\non to our data, alright?\n\n375\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.870\nUnderstand, when we talk about information\nthat's coming down through the protocol\n\n376\n00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.520\nstack, alright, We have a raw data that\nsits up there at the application layer,\n\n377\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.380\nmakes its way into this abstract\nlayer of communications.\n\n378\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.690\nWhat each layer does is it does\nwhat's known as encapsulate, right?\n\n379\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.900\nThink about it as receiving\nthat information and wrap,\n\n380\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.130\nputting a wrapper around it.\n\n381\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.160\nWell what does that mean for us?\n\n382\n00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.820\nWell, what that means is it's adding\nits data to the front of its services,\n\n383\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.500\nits information to the front of your.\n\n384\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.810\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you here.\n\n385\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.180\nI've got a little bit\nof a diagram here and\n\n386\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.080\nif we look at the diagram,\nnotice that I have my data.\n\n387\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.300\nNotice the data never changes.\n\n388\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.460\nThat's what we actually want to save.\n\n389\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.110\nAll right.\n\n390\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.620\nAnd I know my head is kind of\ncovering this one up here but\n\n391\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.580\nnotice that the application layer right?\n\n392\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.620\nWe have an application layer header.\n\n393\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.960\nAnd then what it does is it needs to\n\n394\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.590\nutilize essentially\nthe presentation layer.\n\n395\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.800\nSo it adds its information,\nsends it down to the presentation layer,\n\n396\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.440\nthe presentation layer\nadds its information.\n\n397\n00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.030\nSo notice we have more information\nthat's been added to your data.\n\n398\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.210\nAnd again remember, you've got your\nletter going into your envelope, and\n\n399\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.240\nnow the envelope's being prepared\nto put out there on the network.\n\n400\n00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.950\nThen as we go down from the presentation\nlayer, we add a session layer header.\n\n401\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.100\nAnd again that encapsulation is\njust adding that information.\n\n402\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.630\nThe session layer, the outside of\nthe presentation layer information.\n\n403\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.350\nAnd then it gets handed down\nto the transport layer.\n\n404\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.120\nAnd guess what.\n\n405\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.370\nYes the transport layer\nadds its information.\n\n406\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:12.925\nSo you can see, this encapsulation process\nis what we call going down the stack.\n\n407\n00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:17.400\nThen finally down to the network layer,\nwhen we hit the network layer this is\n\n408\n00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.510\nwhere we're adding things like our source\nand destination IP addresses and then\n\n409\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:25.830\nfinally down to the data link layer and\nthis is where we're looking and checking\n\n410\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.930\nthings like MAC addresses if you will,\nthis is where your frames are happening.\n\n411\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.550\nFinally, we get down to\nthe physical layer, and\n\n412\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.860\nthis is where our binary ones and\nzeros are, right.\n\n413\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.580\nOur electrical impulses, our raw bits.\n\n414\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.270\nNow when you are going down the stack,\n\n415\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.420\nthat means you're sending information,\nall right?\n\n416\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.500\nThat means I'm sending\ninformation to Mike's computer.\n\n417\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.420\nMy data has to be prepared so it'll\nmake its way out onto the medium, and\n\n418\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.540\nmake it's way to Mike's computer.\n\n419\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.110\nNow once Mike's computer\nreceives that information,\n\n420\n00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.200\nnow he's gonna start processing\nthe information up the protocol stack.\n\n421\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.520\nSo you hear those terms, jargon.\n\n422\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.220\nThey say, down the protocol stack,\nup the protocol stack.\n\n423\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.990\nIf I'm sending information,\n\n424\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.140\nwe're going down the protocol stack to the\nencapsulation of process of adding all of\n\n425\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.610\nthe extra information to get your\ncommunications over to the destination.\n\n426\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.110\nOnce it hits the destination, you're gonna\nstrip off that excess information or\n\n427\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.550\nprocess it, if you will.\n\n428\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:24.600\nFinally, we get back to the inside of\nthe wrapper and that's our raw data.\n\n429\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.390\nSo know a little bit about the OSI model.\n\n430\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.060\nKnow some of the devices that we've seen\nthat actually operate at these layers.\n\n431\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.890\nBe prepared to know what protocols\noperate at different layers too.\n\n432\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.000\nDoesn't mean you have to\nknow all the protocols, but\n\n433\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.410\ndefinitely know some common ones.\n\n434\n00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.080\nKnow things like IP.\n\n435\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.600\nKnow things that your routing protocols.\n\n436\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.610\nKnow that your routers operate at layer 3.\n\n437\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.150\nRight know that ethernet operates at\nlayer two and the physical layer.\n\n438\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.090\nKnow that at layer two\nthings like switches.\n\n439\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.440\nThis is gonna be important information for\nthe network plus exam.\n\n440\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.210\nThen it's also important information,\n\n441\n00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.010\ntoo, as you'll see when we move\ninto our troubleshooting model.\n\n442\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.160\nSo you know, well, where's the issue line.\n\n443\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.520\nWell, if Mike was to come to\nme right now and say hey, Wes,\n\n444\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.220\nwe don't have communications,\nI think it's a layer 3 issue.\n\n445\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.560\nWell, he's telling me right away, I don't\nknow if it's the IP address that's wrong,\n\n446\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.850\nI don't know if my our router's happening,\nsomething's happening.\n\n447\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.470\nOr he says, I think we've got\na physical layer problem.\n\n448\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.330\nI know that what I need to do is I need\nto go start checking cables, right?\n\n449\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.310\nCuz I know that cables operate\nat the physical layer.\n\n450\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.620\nSo it's perfect for\ntroubleshooting as well.\n\n451\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.090\nDon't think that it's all theory right?\n\n452\n00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.540\nIt's a lot of theory, mostly theory, but\nyou can also use that same theory and\n\n453\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.730\nyou're troubleshooting, when it comes\nto trying to identify diagnose and\n\n454\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.580\nthen hopefully resolve the issues that\nyou might face within your network.\n\n455\n00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.970\nThe OSI model is very important not just\nin a theory purpose you're going to be\n\n456\n00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.180\nusing it even in your networking careers.\n&gt;&gt; Alright, great stuff there, Wes.\n\n457\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.440\nReally good look at the OSI model,\n\n458\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.720\nthe different layers that make up that\nOSI model, and what goes on at each one.\n\n459\n00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.670\nAs well as where some\nof these devices work,\n\n460\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.310\nanother very important part of\nGetting ready for this exam,\n\n461\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.310\nunderstanding where those routers operate,\nwhere those switches operate.\n\n462\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:08.720\nAnd kinda breaking out that matryoshka,\nI think, doll type situation where each\n\n463\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.990\nlayer is just wrapping or encapsulating\nthat previous layer's information.\n\n464\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.840\nAnd then sending it across the wire and\n\n465\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.280\nthen breaking each one of those layers off\nat the other end as it receives that data.\n\n466\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.720\nSo we appreciate that Wes, we thank you.\n\n467\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.380\nAnd then hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching this one signing off for ITProTV,\n\n468\n00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.020\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n469\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.509\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n470\n00:23:29.509 -->

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.335\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:11.471\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:15.380\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.110\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick,\n\n7\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.080\nand today we're doing our\nAccelerated Comp TIA Network+.\n\n8\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.320\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at properties\n\n9\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.530\nof network traffic.\n\n10\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.640\nAnd here to show us the way and\nhelp us with that is mister Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.450\nWelcome, Wes.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me here Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.190\nThat's right we are going to be\nlooking at, well like Mike said,\n\n13\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.330\nsome of the characteristics.\n\n14\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.200\nWe say properties of our network traffic.\n\n15\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.130\nSome of the different characteristics when\nit comes to the communications within our\n\n16\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.900\nnetworks.\n\n17\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.610\nWe're going be looking at things\nlike what happens when two\n\n18\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.370\nnodes send communications on the same\nshared media at the same time.\n\n19\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.130\nAnd some of the problems that\nwe might face with that,\n\n20\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.880\nas well as some of the things that\nwe can do to try to eliminate that.\n\n21\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.190\n&gt;&gt; And maybe bring it down a more\n\n22\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.390\nacceptable level of, I wouldn't say risk,\nbut performance hindrance, if you will.\n\n23\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.570\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive right\ninto, and one of the first things that I\n\n24\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.420\nwanna do is probably start out with\nthe communication types that we have.\n\n25\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.720\nBefore we get into things like broadcast\ndomains, and collision domains,\n\n26\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.070\nwhich, we'll get into in a second.\n\n27\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.390\nLet's go ahead,\nif we say a broadcast domain, well,\n\n28\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.000\nwhat the heck is a broadcast?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.880\n&gt;&gt; And why is it in a domain, right?\n\n30\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.970\nSo, let's go ahead, and\nwe'll define it there, we'll start there.\n\n31\n00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.940\nLet's talk about three communication\ntypes that we have in our networks and\n\n32\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.300\nwhile there's a fourth one there,\nit's not in the objectives.\n\n33\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.060\nI do want to go ahead and just kinda\nmention it cuz you'll see it in IPv6 and\n\n34\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.660\nwe'll talk more about IPv6\nin later episodes, right?\n\n35\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.370\nOne of the first communications that\nwe have, since I've already kinda let\n\n36\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.510\nthe cat out of the bag,\nwe'll talk about broadcast communication.\n\n37\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.662\nI've got a little diagram here, and when\nwe talk about a broadcast communication,\n\n38\n00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:48.050\nI want you to understand it as\na one to all communication, right?\n\n39\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.050\nI want you to think of this as like maybe\ngoing down to the shopping mall and\n\n40\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.910\ngoing to the food court.\n\n41\n00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.370\nStanding in the middle of the food court\nand yelling at the top of your lungs.\n\n42\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.020\nWell that is a broadcast communication,\nright, you're broadcasting your voice to\n\n43\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.590\neverybody that's in earshot of your voice,\nright?\n\n44\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.620\nWell, that's the same thing that\nhappens inside of your networks when\n\n45\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.060\nnodes send broadcast communications.\n\n46\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.760\nIt means they're sending,\nas you'll learn in later episodes,\n\n47\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.900\nto a specific address that says, hey,\nI wanna send that communication.\n\n48\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.490\nBecause i want everybody\non the network to hear it.\n\n49\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.380\nAnd it has its purpose\nwithin our networks today.\n\n50\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.141\nWe'll go on and\nwe'll learn about things like ARP,\n\n51\n00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:25.770\nand how ARP helps us to resolve\nMAC addresses to IP addresses.\n\n52\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.790\nAnd so it does have its utilizations\ninside of our networks today.\n\n53\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.080\nNow the next type of communication\nthat we have is probably\n\n54\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.010\nthe polar opposite of a broadcast, right?\n\n55\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.240\nIf we say a broadcast is a one to all,\n\n56\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.990\nwell a unicast is a one\nto one communication.\n\n57\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.310\nThis is when you're\nasking a specific device.\n\n58\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.130\nYou're not saying hey,\neverybody, I wanna talk to you.\n\n59\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.930\nYou're saying hey Mike,\nI just need to talk to you,\n\n60\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.630\nI don't need to talk to\neverybody else in the room.\n\n61\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.920\nAnd again, it is a directed one to\none communication, and so know that.\n\n62\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.780\nAnd so for instance,\nif you're doing a file transfer, right?\n\n63\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.130\nIf you're doing a file transfer,\nyou're talking right to the file server.\n\n64\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.240\nAnd you're communicating just between\nyou and that file server, your node,\n\n65\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.850\nif you will and that file server,\nthat is a unicast communication.\n\n66\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.090\nSo remember, one to all, one to one.\n\n67\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.370\nBut then there's another one out there and\nthat one's what's known as a multicast,\n\n68\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.970\nand I like to liken this one\nto a pay-per-view type event.\n\n69\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.210\nIf you think about it,\nthey commonly say one to many, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.690\nTo kind of differentiate it between\none to all, and one to one.\n\n71\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.140\nI want you think of it instead of one to\nmany, one to a specific group, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.730\nOr one to a collection of nodes, right?\n\n73\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.270\nThat's why they say many,\nbut it's really a group.\n\n74\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.360\nIf you're not in the group,\nwell guess what?\n\n75\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.320\nYou don't get the communication,\n\n76\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.570\nand that's kind of like I said\nwith the pay-per-view event.\n\n77\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.210\nIf you think about it,\nI remember when I was younger, me and\n\n78\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.385\nmy friends we used to love\nwatching the prize fights.\n\n79\n00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:53.630\nBut we would all save up our money,\nright, and\n\n80\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.800\nwe would get the one mom that could stand\nall the kids her house at the same time,\n\n81\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.250\nand we'd say, Okay, we got our money.\n\n82\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.740\nCan you order the pay-per-view event,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.950\nAnd her house or that house would be\nthe one house within the neighborhood,\n\n84\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.970\nwell that we knew of that would be\ngetting that pay-per-view event right?\n\n85\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.900\nNow from the cable provider side right,\nthat pay-per-view event is going\n\n86\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.750\nto everybody that's in the group,\nspecifically the people who paid right?\n\n87\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.880\nThat's kind of like a multicast.\n\n88\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.340\nA multicast is a one to a group,\none to a select few.\n\n89\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.220\nYou have to be in the group,\nyou receive the communications.\n\n90\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.440\nYou're not in the group, understand\nyou don't receive the transmission.\n\n91\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.510\nThere's another one that I want\nto throw out there, because,\n\n92\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.470\nagain, it's not called\nout in the objectives.\n\n93\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.350\nBut as we move in, at the time\nof this recording we're in 2018,\n\n94\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.760\nyou're getting more and\nmore exposure to IPv6.\n\n95\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.620\nI also want to call out another one and\nthat's called an anycast.\n\n96\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.320\nAll right, it's another communication type\nnot as popular as those three common ones\n\n97\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.110\nbut an anycast is a one to the best,\nall right?\n\n98\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.690\nBasically you can have more\nthan one destination but\n\n99\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.940\nwhen your device is gonna figure out\nwhere do I sent this information?\n\n100\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.380\nI'm gonna use the best choice.\n\n101\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.380\nWe see that in things like DNS, right?\n\n102\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.650\nAs we talked in other episodes,\nwe talked about the DNS hierarchy.\n\n103\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.750\nThere's hundreds and hundreds of root\nservers out there, root hint servers,\n\n104\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.480\nwhere we start the name\nresolution process off, right?\n\n105\n00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.350\nWell, am I going to go to one that's\nall the way around the world to China,\n\n106\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.990\nor am I going to go to one that's sitting\nin maybe let's say Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n107\n00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.140\nAll right, it's one to the best, it\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's one to all,\n\n108\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.360\nits not one to a select few,\nit's one to whatever the best choice is.\n\n109\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.520\nIt's called an anycast, it's part of IPv6,\nand I do want you to understand it.\n\n110\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.730\nNow that we understand what\nthe communication types are,\n\n111\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.226\nthat might make a little bit more sense\nwhen we start talking about things\n\n112\n00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:45.490\nlike broadcast domains and\ncollision domains, okay.\n\n113\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.728\nIn another episode, we talk about our\nnetwork topologies and one of the things\n\n114\n00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:51.734\nthat we mentioned in that episode,\nwe mention something known as a bus.\n\n115\n00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:57.100\nRemember that all your nodes are connected\nto a central copper conductor, right?\n\n116\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.960\nWe have to understand, like we've\nmentioned, is that when one node sends\n\n117\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.660\na communication, down that same shared\nmedium everybody hears it, right?\n\n118\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.600\nNow here's the thing\nwith that shared medium.\n\n119\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.380\nWhat happens if another node sends\ncommunication at the same time, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.460\nWell two trains headed towards each other\ndown a single track the same shared medium\n\n121\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.580\neventually what's gonna happen\nis they're gonna collide, right?\n\n122\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.520\nWell the same thing happens with\nelectrical collisions inside of\n\n123\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.740\nyour networks.\n\n124\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.840\nAll right,\nthat's what's known as a collision domain.\n\n125\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.580\nWhen you have two nodes in the same shared\nmedium and they send communication at\n\n126\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.550\nthe same time, they're known as being\na part of the same collision domain.\n\n127\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.540\nUnlike a broadcast domain.\n\n128\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.890\nRemember the example of\na broadcast communication,\n\n129\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.510\nI mentioned that it's like\nstanding up in the food court and\n\n130\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.220\nyelling out at the top of your lungs and\nwhoever's in earshot.\n\n131\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.600\nWell what does the earshot mean?\n\n132\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.860\nWell if we're talking about the food\ncourt it's how loud you can yell, right,\n\n133\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.690\nand how far people are away from you.\n\n134\n00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.360\nBut when when we talk about\nbroadcast communications and\n\n135\n00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.960\nnetworking, it's who's a part of\nthe broadcast domain, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.340\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nI've actually got a little slide or\n\n137\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.940\ndiagram here that can kind of help out.\n\n138\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.540\nWhen we plug computers into a hub,\nremember in our networking device section,\n\n139\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.290\nwe talked about hubs,\nthey're dumb connectivity devices.\n\n140\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.610\nWe tried to eliminate them from our\nnetworks and have for a very long time.\n\n141\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.660\nWhy is that?\n\n142\n00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.278\nWell, remember that if PC 1\nsends information into the hub,\n\n143\n00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:25.749\nwho's going to hear it?\n\n144\n00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:28.550\nWell, PC 2.\n&gt;&gt; Anybody that's hooked up to that host\n\n145\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.461\n&gt;&gt; PC 3, that's right.\n\n146\n00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:31.920\n&gt;&gt; So is there a potential that PC 1, and\n\n147\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.610\nlet's just say numerically going\nfrom the left to the right here,\n\n148\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.950\nthat PC 2 could send information\ninto the hub at the same time?\n\n149\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.660\nWell there is a potential right?\n\n150\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.141\nThat's a collision domain,\nbecause if one sends, they all hear,\n\n151\n00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:47.432\ntwo send at the same time, there's gonna\nbe an electrical collision, all right?\n\n152\n00:07:47.432 --> 00:07:51.779\nAnd when you connect into a hub, you're\nconnected to the same collision domain,\n\n153\n00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:52.414\nall right?\n\n154\n00:07:52.414 --> 00:07:54.299\nNow, what's a broadcast domain?\n\n155\n00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:59.750\nWell, Technically, everything that goes\ninto a hub is what's known as a broadcast.\n\n156\n00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.390\nBut it's a little bit different because\nwhen we talk about a broadcast domain,\n\n157\n00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.700\nwhat we're actually talking about is,\nnow we're talking about a switch, right?\n\n158\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.209\nA switch receives its information,\nreceives a frame, right?\n\n159\n00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:15.150\nAnd it can see that there's\na destination address called, well,\n\n160\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.000\nthe broadcast address,\nit's called a broadcast MAC address.\n\n161\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.230\nAnd that's how when you're\nconnected to a switch, a PC1 says,\n\n162\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.670\nhey I've got communications that, now\nwe're talking about a little bit of logic.\n\n163\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.910\nI'm going to address,\nsend to a specific address so\n\n164\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.450\nthat everybody hears it, all right?\n\n165\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.340\nIf you are connected to where you can\nreceive that broadcast communication,\n\n166\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.280\nyou're considered in\nthe same broadcast domain.\n\n167\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.520\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n168\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.800\nNotice PC1,\nif it sends information into the hub,\n\n169\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.000\nhub doesn't understand any destination\naddresses, doesn't understand any of that,\n\n170\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.670\nthey're gonna be in the same collision.\n\n171\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.020\nBut notice it's gonna go to this PC,\nit's gonna go to this PC,\n\n172\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.420\nbut it's also gonna go from\nthe hub into the switch.\n\n173\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.940\nNow, here's where we start talking about\nthe broadcast address because the switch\n\n174\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.410\nunderstands MAC addresses.\n\n175\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.020\nIt's gonna look and it's gonna\nlook at the destination frame, or\n\n176\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.410\ndestination MAC address and\nit's gonna say hey,\n\n177\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.030\nI need to send this out to\neverybody that is connected to me.\n\n178\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.554\nWell, guess what's gonna happen\nin the broadcast domain.\n\n179\n00:09:17.554 --> 00:09:20.900\nWhen PC1 sends a broadcast\ncommunication into the switch,\n\n180\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.660\nthe switch is going to\nflood that out all ports.\n\n181\n00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.480\nNotice that the broadcast\ndomain Is a little bit\n\n182\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.640\nbigger than the collision domain, right?\n\n183\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.230\nBecause if there's a computer that, let's\nsay PC2 here, it's connected to Hub 2.\n\n184\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.713\nWhen it sends a communication into\nthe hub, if it's not bound for\n\n185\n00:09:37.713 --> 00:09:42.130\na broadcast address,\nthe switch doesn't do anything with it.\n\n186\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.067\nUnless, let's say in fairness it was\nsupposed to go to one of the computers\n\n187\n00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:47.410\nover here, then it's going\nto forward inappropriately.\n\n188\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.260\nAnd you'll learn that when we talk\nabout how a switch operates in\n\n189\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.320\nour networking device section.\n\n190\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.160\nSo just understand that the broadcast\ndomain is any device that is\n\n191\n00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.220\nconnected that can hear a true\naddressed broadcast communication.\n\n192\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.742\nA collision domain essentially is two or\n\n193\n00:10:03.742 --> 00:10:06.940\nmore computers that are on\nthe same shared medium.\n\n194\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.430\nAnd this is one of the reasons they said,\nyou know what?\n\n195\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.490\nWe gotta do away with hubs.\n\n196\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.610\nAnd that's because it doesn't\nmatter if it's broadcast.\n\n197\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.180\nIt doesn't matter if it's unicast.\n\n198\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.890\nIt doesn't matter if it's multicast.\n\n199\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.840\nYou're a select few, right?\n\n200\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.400\nThe hub doesn't understand any of that.\n\n201\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.190\nIt just means whenever I see it, I'm\ngonna repeat it out of all other ports.\n\n202\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.280\nWhich means there could be\nwasted communications, right?\n\n203\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.483\nIf PC1 needs to send a unicast\ncommunication all the way over here to\n\n204\n00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:36.480\nPC2, it doesn't matter if it's\naddressed directly to PC2.\n\n205\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.180\nWhen it hits the hub,\nthe hub just sends it out all ports.\n\n206\n00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.630\nThen that's a collision domain.\n\n207\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.500\nBut then when it hits the switch,\n\n208\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.920\nthe switch looks at the destination frame\ninformation, and says well, wait a second,\n\n209\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.190\nI know that's going to PC2, and\nPC2 is connected to this port.\n\n210\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.220\nBut please understand, again,\nit's just based on the size,\n\n211\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.730\nreally, if you're in earshot of\nthe broadcast communication.\n\n212\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.450\nNow, I will tell you, one of the reasons\nwe use switches today is because the way\n\n213\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.020\nswitches can forward information.\n\n214\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.910\nThey can forward information based on\na database that is stored with them and\n\n215\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.870\nwe'll talk about that in other episodes.\n\n216\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.109\nBut what they can do is they can inspect\nthe information and they can say, okay,\n\n217\n00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.465\nwell, I see, let's say, PC1 over here.\n\n218\n00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:20.646\nLet's say PC1, 2, 3, and 4, right?\n\n219\n00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:25.330\nPC1 is gonna send information to PC4.\n\n220\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.390\nEssentially the switch is\ngonna receive that frame.\n\n221\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.461\nIt's gonna see the destination\naddress is for PC4 and\n\n222\n00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:34.220\nit's gonna forward it appropriately.\n\n223\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.030\nBut, at the same time,\n\n224\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.170\none of the other PCs can be\nsending information back to PC1.\n\n225\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.160\nAnd why is it that there isn't\nan electrical collision?\n\n226\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.570\nWell, it's because the switch is doing\n\n227\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.784\nthe forwarding of the information\ninternally within it.\n\n228\n00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:53.790\nAll right, so switches actually give\nyou the ability to essentially isolate\n\n229\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.160\nevery single device in\nit's own collision domain.\n\n230\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.650\nAnd that's because it can operate in what\nwe call full duplex communication, send\n\n231\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.010\nand receive information, and sends its\nforwarding information between its ports.\n\n232\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.480\nWe don't really have to worry about\ncontention to collision, right?\n\n233\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.610\nThe collision is only gonna happen\nbetween the switch port, and\n\n234\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.460\nthe device that's connected to it, and\nthe switch is doing the forwarding anyway.\n\n235\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.810\nSo we don't really have those collisions,\nthey're not really present, right?\n\n236\n00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.400\nLet's take that a little bit farther,\nall right?\n\n237\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.390\nWhen we talk about broadcast\ncommunications, right?\n\n238\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.230\nEverything that's sent into a hub is\nbroadcast out all our other ports.\n\n239\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.880\nIt has nothing to do with addressing,\nthat's just the way it's hardwired.\n\n240\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.120\nA switch will send broadcast\ninformation if it's\n\n241\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.000\naddressed in the frame to a broadcast\ncommunication, all fs, I believe,\n\n242\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.950\nis what the broadcast MAC address is,\nright?\n\n243\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.300\nIt will, basically, act like a hub,\nbut it's based on addressing.\n\n244\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.240\nNow, here's routers, what do routers do?\n\n245\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.530\nWell, routers actually isolate\nbroadcast communications,\n\n246\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.710\nwhich is kinda interesting, if we put\na router in between here, all right?\n\n247\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.200\nAnd let's say, now we've got PC1 here,\nand we got a few switches, right?\n\n248\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.500\nPC1 sends a broadcast address\ncommunication into the port.\n\n249\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.410\nWell, guess what?\n\n250\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:18.010\nThe switch is going to basically\nsend that to PC2, PC3, PC4, across\n\n251\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.660\nthis line to the next switch to 5,\n6, 7 and 8.\n\n252\n00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.690\nAnd yes, all the way up to the router.\n\n253\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.250\nBut routers, they don't forward.\n\n254\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.890\nThey don't route broadcast communication,\nby default.\n\n255\n00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.890\nThere are situations which you\ndon't have to worry about for\n\n256\n00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.360\nthis exam, that they can.\n\n257\n00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.580\nBut by default, they'll see that broadcast\ncommunication and they'll drop it.\n\n258\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.350\nAnd that's the great thing about routers.\n\n259\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.925\nRouters isolate broadcast domains.\n\n260\n00:13:43.925 --> 00:13:46.240\nAnd so do understand that.\n\n261\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.810\nSo now we've got two different\nbroadcast domains, all right?\n\n262\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:56.220\nSo when that broadcast communication\nfrom PC1 goes up to the router,\n\n263\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.760\nit never makes it to\nthis side of the network.\n\n264\n00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.400\nAnd that's important, right?\n\n265\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.390\nBecause broadcast communications, the more\nbroadcast communications you have, and\n\n266\n00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.060\nthis goes back to what\nyou said at the start,\n\n267\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.420\nwhen you said the properties\nof our network.\n\n268\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.250\nToo many broadcast communications actually\ncan degrade the performance of your\n\n269\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.350\nnetwork, right?\n\n270\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.110\nBecause it basically creates\nexcessive communications, right?\n\n271\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.190\nAnd the more of these\nbroadcast communications,\n\n272\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.340\nthe worse your network performance can be.\n\n273\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.790\nSo what we have,\nthey call broadcast storms.\n\n274\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.668\nIt's one of the reasons it switches,\nif you will, will implement things like\n\n275\n00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:32.780\nSpanning Tree Algorithm, or STA, or\nSpanning Tree Protocol, if you will, STP,\n\n276\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.580\nin order to stop what eventually\ncan just cripple your network.\n\n277\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.400\nSo, know those, right?\n\n278\n00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.310\nKnow broadcast domains, and\nknow collision domains.\n\n279\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.960\nNow, the next thing that\nwe have to look at is\n\n280\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.390\nhow do our nodes access the media,\nall right?\n\n281\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.440\nAnd unfortunately, Mike,\nI wish I had an easier way to say this but\n\n282\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.360\nit's gonna be a whole bunch\nof alphabet soup here.\n\n283\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.990\nWe have two different types, all right?\n\n284\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.430\nWe have what's known as Carrier Sense\nMultiple Access Collision Detection,\n\n285\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.070\nthat is CDMACD.\n\n286\n00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.610\nWe also have something known as\n\n287\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.870\nCarrier Sense Multiple Access\nCollision Avoidance, all right?\n\n288\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.710\nSo, whichever one we're talking about,\nwe're gonna talk about both of them.\n\n289\n00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.200\nBut notice the CSMA, what does that mean?\n\n290\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.490\nCarrier sense.\n\n291\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.060\nWhat's happening?\n\n292\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.360\nThe node is saying, hey,\nis the media present?\n\n293\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.680\nMultiple access,\nmore than one device accessing the media.\n\n294\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.330\nCollision detection.\n\n295\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.200\nWell, it seems like they're gonna detect\nthat something's happened, right?\n\n296\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.380\nThat collision has happened.\n\n297\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.090\nLet's see here.\n\n298\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.620\nLet's kinda take a look at how that works,\nall right?\n\n299\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.378\nSo Ethernet networks use whats known\nas Carrier Sense Multiple Access,\n\n300\n00:15:37.378 --> 00:15:39.250\nyour 802.3 networks.\n\n301\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.870\nThey use Carrier Sense Multiple\nAccess Collision Detections.\n\n302\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.558\nSorry, I forgot the CD part\nof the collision detection.\n\n303\n00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:44.068\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.630\n&gt;&gt; And so what's happening here?\n\n305\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.727\nAll right, well, carrier sense.\n\n306\n00:15:48.727 --> 00:15:51.530\nAll right, the node is saying,\nhey, is the media there?\n\n307\n00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.360\nI'm listening.\n\n308\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.871\nIs there anybody out there\ntrying to transmit data?\n\n309\n00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:56.956\nAll right, well guess what?\n\n310\n00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.992\nYou can have another node here that says,\nhey, I'm listening.\n\n311\n00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:02.214\nAre you out there sending information?\n\n312\n00:16:02.214 --> 00:16:04.400\nNo, okay.\n\n313\n00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.568\nWell first computer says well I'm gonna\ngo ahead then, if I can't hear anybody\n\n314\n00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:12.830\ntransmitting data, I'm gonna go ahead and\ntransmit information.\n\n315\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.650\nWell you know what?\n\n316\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.790\nThat other computer says the same thing,\nright?\n\n317\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.910\nIt says hey, I'm gonna go ahead and\ntransmit my data.\n\n318\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.200\nWell what happens?\n\n319\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.740\nWell here's where the electrical\ncollision happens, right?\n\n320\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.149\nTwo trains going on the same track and\nthey're heading towards each other, right?\n\n321\n00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.010\nCollision detection part means is\nthat what's gonna happen is those,\n\n322\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.050\nthat electrical signal is going to bounce,\nit's gonna reflect and\n\n323\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.970\nit's gonna reflect back\nto the network adapters.\n\n324\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.010\nAnd the network adaptors are gonna\nsense the fragmented packet or\n\n325\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.840\nfragmented frame more specifically.\n\n326\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.930\nThey're gonna sense,\nhey there is a fragmented frame here, so\n\n327\n00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.170\nwhat do we need to do?\n\n328\n00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.270\nWell what they turn around and\ndo is they wait.\n\n329\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.940\nThey go into a waiting period.\n\n330\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.420\nAnd it's a random back off time.\n\n331\n00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.280\nAnd I'm sitting next to a cryptology\nguy that says it's pseudo random.\n\n332\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.090\nNothing in computers happens unless\nwe tell it to happen that way, right?\n\n333\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.480\nBut they wait a random back off period,\nright?\n\n334\n00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.300\nAnd what are they doing?\n\n335\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.290\nThey're gonna say, okay, you know what?\n\n336\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.850\nMike, I'm gonna go ahead and\nwait for a second and my bad.\n\n337\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:11.090\nYou go ahead and transmit your\ninformation, or at least, that's the goal.\n\n338\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.360\nIt doesn't mean that it won't happen.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n339\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.030\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't\n\n340\n00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.770\nmean that you won't get collisions again,\nbut then,\n\n341\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.800\nonce that back off period is done,\nwe re-transmit our information.\n\n342\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.878\nFinally, hopefully, this other\ncomputer will do the same thing.\n\n343\n00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:28.940\nThat is carrier-sense multiple access\ncollision detection, now again,\n\n344\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.150\nin a contention based media access\nthat seems like a lot is going on,\n\n345\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.630\na lot of waste is going on and\nthere is a potential for waste, but\n\n346\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.730\nremember it brings the price of the\ndevices down, deterministic media access\n\n347\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.330\nuses a lot of resources And\nthere's a reason Ethernet has won out.\n\n348\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.480\nBecause of its price,\nbecause of how cheap it is.\n\n349\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.490\nBut know that carrier sense multiple\naccess collision detection is\n\n350\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.560\nused by Ethernet technologies 802.3.\n\n351\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.060\nNow.\n\n352\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.770\nSo that is on bounded media.\n\n353\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.560\nHow do we detect whether a collision has\nhappened if when we're using unbounded\n\n354\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.940\nmedia?\n&gt;&gt; A little more difficult?\n\n355\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.710\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n356\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.979\nI can send a signal out,\nand where did it go?\n\n357\n00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:13.840\n[LAUGH] I can't hear anything.\n\n358\n00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.530\nAnd this is how our wireless devices,\nour 802.11 devices,\n\n359\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.160\nthey actually use something\nslightly different.\n\n360\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.380\nAll right, and it's called carrier sense\nmultiple access collision avoidance.\n\n361\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.040\nNow, understand collision\navoidance is the goal.\n\n362\n00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.000\nIt doesn't mean that\ncollisions don't happen.\n\n363\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.920\nBut it is a little bit different\nbecause we're using radiating energy.\n\n364\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.940\nIf we're using the train tracks\nwe can detect a collision.\n\n365\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.390\nBut if we send it off in the air there's\nno way to detect whether a collision\n\n366\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.930\nhas happened.\n\n367\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.310\nSo the goal is collision avoidance.\n\n368\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.780\nLet's go ahead and\nkinda show you how this happens, right?\n\n369\n00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.780\nSo, carrier sends multiple access,\nCA if you will,\n\n370\n00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.470\ncollision avoidance is hey, one client's\ngonna say, hey, I've got some data.\n\n371\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.780\nI need to transmit.\n\n372\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.780\nBasically, sending out and\nmaking a whole entire network\n\n373\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.330\nknow that I've got an intent to send\ninformation, and they call it a GM signal.\n\n374\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.580\nAll right, client two here says,\nyeah, you know what I heard that.\n\n375\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.520\nI'll go ahead and wait.\n\n376\n00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.226\nRemember, goal is collision avoidance,\nall right.\n\n377\n00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:14.800\nAnd then, this next computers, let me\nmake sure that I did it twice there,\n\n378\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.310\nI sure did.\n\n379\n00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.190\nHold on, there we go.\n\n380\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.960\nNow, here's the problem with that, right?\n\n381\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.870\nOnce you send a jam signal the computer\nis going to them and say okay.\n\n382\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.990\nI've given everybody time to hear\nthat jam signal, I'll go ahead and\n\n383\n00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.150\nsend my information.\n\n384\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.810\nAnd every computer,\nit's kind of like a wait in line method.\n\n385\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.250\nHey, I've got information to send.\n\n386\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.000\nOkay, a computer hears that,\nI'll stand in line next and\n\n387\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.310\nI'll let you know I've got data to send\nand hopefully everything goes alright.\n\n388\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.400\nWe've got a nice even line,\nkeep the line moving That's\n\n389\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.000\nnot really what's gonna happen, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.130\n&gt;&gt; I want you to think of a scenario as\n\n391\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:55.250\nlike, maybe Mike and I, we're standing\non a football field, all right?\n\n392\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.660\nI'm on one end zone,\nhe's on the other end zone, right?\n\n393\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.530\nAnd I say, Mike, I have data to send.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Excuse me, what?\n\n394\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.220\n&gt;&gt; Mike goes, what,\n\n395\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.760\nI didn't hear nothing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n397\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.510\n&gt;&gt; One of the problems with CSMA-CA\n\n398\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:12.570\nis the fact that it would create what's\nknown as this hidden node phenomenon.\n\n399\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.170\nAll right, I just like saying the word\n\n400\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.466\nphenomenon, it's fun.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And would happen was,\n\n402\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:22.380\nit's like, again if Mike and I\nare wireless devices, and we're sitting on\n\n403\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.170\nthe opposite sides of the football field,\n&gt;&gt; What's the chance that\n\n404\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.150\nI can call out and I can say,\nhey, I've got data to send but\n\n405\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.760\nhe can't hear me all the way on\nthe other side of the field?\n\n406\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.200\nWell he can probably\ntell me the same thing.\n\n407\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.840\nAnd guess what?\n\n408\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.660\nWe didn't hear each other.\n\n409\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.075\nSo we send our information and\nwhat happens?\n\n410\n00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:38.745\nThere's a collision.\n\n411\n00:20:38.745 --> 00:20:40.165\nRemember the goal is avoid this.\n\n412\n00:20:40.165 --> 00:20:42.965\nDoesn't mean it's gonna happen that way so\none of the things they implemented was\n\n413\n00:20:42.965 --> 00:20:47.345\nwhat was known as an RTSCTS signal and\nplenty of other things.\n\n414\n00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:52.725\nI don't know if they're gonna ask you this\non the exam but they might and the RTS,\n\n415\n00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:58.070\nagain, no collision, we can't detect it so\nthe information never gets to where it is\n\n416\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.490\nSo they implemented what's\nknown as a RTS/CTS signal.\n\n417\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.860\nAnd what that means is, imagine if I put\nsomebody smack-dab on the 50-yard line,\n\n418\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.770\nand that will be our access point.\n\n419\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.380\nAll right, and instead of trying to yell\n\n420\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.020\nall the way across the field to Mike\nsaying, hey I've got data to send.\n\n421\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.190\nWhat if I just say, hey access\npoint sitting on the 50-yard line.\n\n422\n00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.130\nI got information I need to set.\n\n423\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.130\nWell, Mike might not be able to hear me,\nbut\n\n424\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.680\nwhat are the chances halfway through that\nfield he can talk to the access point?\n\n425\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.260\nAnd I can talk to the access point.\n\n426\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.450\nAnd I send an RTS saying,\n\n427\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.200\nI'm requesting to send information to\nMike, or somebody on this network.\n\n428\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.270\nRight, well the access point\ncan say clear to send.\n\n429\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.320\nNobody on this network right now\nis sending out another jam signal,\n\n430\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.270\nCTS you're ready, you're good, alright.\n\n431\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.720\nAnd the access point tells Cliento2, or\n\n432\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.680\nin this case sitting on the 50 yard line,\nit says Mike Hold on one second,\n\n433\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.990\nyou can't hear it client one or\nWes has information to sent.\n\n434\n00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.926\nOr I might request to send and the access\npoints says, well shut up Mike's talking.\n\n435\n00:22:00.926 --> 00:22:01.640\nNot really.\n\n436\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n437\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.230\n&gt;&gt; But it might say that.\n\n438\n00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.590\nBasically say,\nyou gotta hold on you couldn't hear it\n\n439\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.390\nMike's already request to transmit his\ninformation request to transmit signal.\n\n440\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.110\nRight.\n\n441\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.830\nYou need just whole office again,\nThen I would a back off period and\n\n442\n00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.770\nthen I send the access point again.\n\n443\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.170\nHey, I'm still waiting here.\n\n444\n00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.610\nI got information I need\nto send them by okay.\n\n445\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.720\nSo RTSCTS,\n\n446\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.610\nIt was one of the things they tried to\nimplement amongst many technologies.\n\n447\n00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.190\nTo stop that hidden nodes syndrome cause\nit would still cause collisions and\n\n448\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:36.180\nunfortunately we would start to get\nperformance degradation there if you will.\n\n449\n00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.620\nAlright let's see Mike a couple more\nthings I know we're running a little bit\n\n450\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.570\nshort on time here.\n\n451\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:47.070\nI do wanna mention something\nknown as pdus alright.\n\n452\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:52.980\nNow in an earlier episode we talked\nabout our OSI model and in the OSI\n\n453\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.890\nmodel we talked about how as we're sending\ninformation down the layers right?\n\n454\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:04.060\nEach layer is providing a service each\nlower layer is providing a service for\n\n455\n00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.240\nan upper layer and\nwhat I mean by that is I tell you what.\n\n456\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.980\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's look at my slide here that I have.\n\n457\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.470\nRemember that we talked about\nthe OSI model and I said, hey,\n\n458\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.650\napplication layer is going to request\nthe services of the presentation layer.\n\n459\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.240\nIt's gonna add it's information.\n\n460\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.230\nIt's got it's information ready.\n\n461\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.160\nIt's gonna send it down to the session\nlayer requiring the services of\n\n462\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.020\nthe session layer.\n\n463\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.430\nThat's how it works.\n\n464\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.550\nEach layer Upper layer is relying on a\nlower layer to provide a functionality so\n\n465\n00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.380\nwe can send information between nodes.\n\n466\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.330\nWell, if you think about it,\nwhat the upper layer is when, and\n\n467\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.750\nin fact, I will tell you.\n\n468\n00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.410\nThis actually starts at\nthe transport layer.\n\n469\n00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.670\nThe application layer, session layer.\n\n470\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.750\nOr application presentation and\nsession layer.\n\n471\n00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.650\nThere are protocol data units as they\ncall it, are just called your data.\n\n472\n00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.371\nBut when I get to the transport layer.\n\n473\n00:23:54.371 --> 00:23:57.529\nThe transport layer is gonna\nprepare its information and\n\n474\n00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:00.368\nthen it needs to rely on\nthe network layer, right?\n\n475\n00:24:00.368 --> 00:24:03.730\nWell when it's got its\ninformation prepared,\n\n476\n00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.630\nthat's what's known as an SDU,\na Service Data Unit.\n\n477\n00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.480\nI'm the transport layer, I've got my\ninformation ready to go, network layer,\n\n478\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.460\nI'm calling on you.\n\n479\n00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.610\nIt's calling on the services\nof the lower layer.\n\n480\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.410\nThe lower layer then\nprovides that functionality,\n\n481\n00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.922\nlet's say, and you know what?\n\n482\n00:24:20.922 --> 00:24:23.650\nLet me make sure I got that right, yeah.\n\n483\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.650\nAnd the network layer is going to\nprovide what is known as a PDU.\n\n484\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.490\nIt's gonna provide it's services,\nthat Protocol Data Unit.\n\n485\n00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.400\nOnce it does that, it's ready.\n\n486\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.800\nIt's got it's information prepared.\n\n487\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.004\nAnd here's where it gets tricky.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Now that it's provided its\n\n489\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.380\nservices, guess what?\n\n490\n00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:46.410\nIt's got an SDU that it's ready to send\ndown to the next layer down below it.\n\n491\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:51.856\nAnd when it calls on the services of\nthe data link layer, the data link layer\n\n492\n00:24:51.856 --> 00:24:57.315\nis gonna provide some services and\nthat's called the protocol data unit.\n\n493\n00:24:57.315 --> 00:25:01.586\nSo understand that each one of these\nlayers, as we move down it, I'm preparing\n\n494\n00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:06.440\nmy information, the layer is, to send it\ndown, that's called a service data unit.\n\n495\n00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.960\nWhen it sends it down to that lower level,\nthat lower layer and\n\n496\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.610\nit prepares the information,\nthat's called a protocol data unit.\n\n497\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.200\nThere are a few different PDUs\nthat you need to be aware of, and\n\n498\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.790\nthey're called something different for\neach layer.\n\n499\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.143\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n500\n00:25:23.143 --> 00:25:27.061\nYour protocol data unit layers,\nLayers 5-7 or\n\n501\n00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:33.410\n7-5 depending on which way you're\nlooking at it, it's just your data.\n\n502\n00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.340\nRemember we said in our ISO model,\nthe application, presentation,\n\n503\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.730\nand session layer are the application\nlayer functioning block.\n\n504\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.400\nAnd that's preparing your\ninformation to put on the network.\n\n505\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.430\nOnce it's prepared,\nthen we get to Layer 4.\n\n506\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.970\nLayer 4's PDU is known as a segment.\n\n507\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.730\nWe generically, and Mike I know\nyou'll probably do this with me,\n\n508\n00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.760\nwe call everything a packet.\n\n509\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.930\nEverything is a packet on the network,\nbut technically at each\n\n510\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.560\nlayer the service that they're providing,\nit's called by a different name.\n\n511\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.280\nA packet is technically the PDU for\n\n512\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.020\nthe network layer, so\nI do want you to know that.\n\n513\n00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.270\nLayer 4, Segment, that's the PDU.\n\n514\n00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.670\nWhy do they call it Segment?\n\n515\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.840\nThink about what transmission protocols do\nit, its segmenting your information and\n\n516\n00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.860\nsequencing it like we've talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n517\n00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.605\nThen once its done,\nit's formulated as SDU,\n\n518\n00:26:27.605 --> 00:26:31.270\nit's gonna hand it down to the network\nlayer and the network layer is\n\n519\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:35.690\ngoing to encapsulate it in its protocol\ndata unit, known as the Packet.\n\n520\n00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.060\nAnd then once that's done\n\n521\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.510\nits now got a service data unit that\nit hands down to the data link layer.\n\n522\n00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.590\nAnd what does the data link layer do?\n\n523\n00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.660\nIt encapsulates the packet in a frame.\n\n524\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.970\nIts PDU is called a frame.\n\n525\n00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.090\nAnd then back down to Layer\n1 that's just raw bits.\n\n526\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.610\nThat's our binary 1 electrical pulses.\n\n527\n00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:55.890\nOn is a 1.\n\n528\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:56.780\nOff is a 0.\n\n529\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.030\nSo that's where our bits are.\n\n530\n00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.880\nNow sometimes it's hard to\nremember what these PDUs are.\n\n531\n00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.710\nSo I got you a little mnemonic just\nlike we did when we were talking about\n\n532\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.180\nthe OSI model.\n\n533\n00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.618\nIf you can remember Segment,\nPacket, Frame, Bit, again,\n\n534\n00:27:10.618 --> 00:27:14.760\n4 to 1, remember,\nSome People Fear Birthdays.\n\n535\n00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.685\nAnd if I do a little bit better English,\nthat'll say Birthdays.\n\n536\n00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:18.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n537\n00:27:18.327 --> 00:27:19.491\n&gt;&gt; And as we get older,\n\n538\n00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:21.878\nwe fear them a little bit more maybe.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n539\n00:27:21.878 --> 00:27:23.250\n&gt;&gt; But if you remember\n\n540\n00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.981\nSome People Fear Birthdays,\nyou can remember what the PDUs are.\n\n541\n00:27:27.981 --> 00:27:30.049\nI guess the last thing we've\ngotta talk about Mike,\n\n542\n00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:32.730\nit looks like I've got one more,\nat that something known as an MTU.\n\n543\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.842\nBoy, we are not shy of\nacronyms in this one, right?\n\n544\n00:27:35.842 --> 00:27:37.440\n&gt;&gt; No, a lot of units going on here.\n\n545\n00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right, a lot of units.\n\n546\n00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.860\nAnd he let the cat out of the bag.\n\n547\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.404\nThat's right, that is what is known\nas a maximum Transmission Units.\n\n548\n00:27:42.404 --> 00:27:45.307\nAnd you wanna know what an MTU is,\n\n549\n00:27:45.307 --> 00:27:50.079\nbecause different networks\ndefine different maximum\n\n550\n00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:55.575\namount of information you can\nhave in a single measurement.\n\n551\n00:27:55.575 --> 00:28:00.071\nYou know, unit of measurement for\ndata, I almost said packet.\n\n552\n00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:03.685\nBut I'll show you one that,\nthis affects us a lot.\n\n553\n00:28:03.685 --> 00:28:05.225\nWe talk about Ethernet.\n\n554\n00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:08.065\nEthernet has a maximum transmission unit.\n\n555\n00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:12.565\nThe maximum size your frame\ncan be is 1500 bytes.\n\n556\n00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:15.955\nAnd if you guys are already prepared,\nyou're gonna say hey Wes,\n\n557\n00:28:15.955 --> 00:28:18.510\nwell wait a second VLAN tags.\n\n558\n00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.850\nSomething completely different,\nthey did add a little padding there.\n\n559\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.736\nBut know, that your operating\nsystems typically set the MTU for\n\n560\n00:28:25.736 --> 00:28:29.279\ntheir data transmissions at 1500 bytes.\n\n561\n00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:33.744\nNow, that can be overridden and changed by\nan administrator on the network devices,\n\n562\n00:28:33.744 --> 00:28:35.550\nbut you need to know what an MTU is.\n\n563\n00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.250\nIn fact, we can see these here.\n\n564\n00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.950\nLet's get into our Windows machine and\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n565\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.800\nOops, apparently I'm going\nto clear the screen here.\n\n566\n00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.440\nJust in case you guys haven't seen netsh,\n\n567\n00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.420\nyou can do a fairly easy command\nhere to see what the MTU is.\n\n568\n00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:59.779\nIf you do netsh interface,\nAnd then IPv4, I guess,\n\n569\n00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:04.620\nyou could just do IP and it'll default\nto 4, but you can do show Interface.\n\n570\n00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.534\nAnd when you do that you can see,\nnotice my network adapter up here?\n\n571\n00:29:09.534 --> 00:29:12.438\nAnd it gives me the index\nnumber metric right here, but\n\n572\n00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:14.660\nthis is what I'm really concerned with.\n\n573\n00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.050\nMy Ethernet adapter, I just named\nit internet cuz it's multi-homed.\n\n574\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.740\nNotice it sets the MTU at 1500 bytes.\n\n575\n00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.410\nSo again,\nit's the operating system that sets it.\n\n576\n00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:28.710\nWe could actually, let's see, I believe\nwe could see this in Mac, as well.\n\n577\n00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:34.035\nSo if I get into our Mac,\nwe can do, what are we gonna do?\n\n578\n00:29:34.035 --> 00:29:38.757\nifconfig and I think it's grep en.\n\n579\n00:29:38.757 --> 00:29:40.410\nYeah, there we go.\n\n580\n00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:44.820\nNotice that my Ethernet adapter\nwithin my Mac, also sets an MTU.\n\n581\n00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.310\nSo you can see mtu of 1500 bytes.\n\n582\n00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.400\nNow not every interface is\ngoing to be 1500 bytes, but for\n\n583\n00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.830\nthe exam I want you to know that when it\ncomes to Ethernet because that's gonna\n\n584\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.940\nbe probably the one they\ntest you on the most.\n\n585\n00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.777\nLike if I do just an ifconfig on here,\n\n586\n00:30:00.777 --> 00:30:04.631\nMac here is one that you\ncan see different MTU's.\n\n587\n00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.402\nMTU of 2000, I believe that's a P2P.\n\n588\n00:30:07.402 --> 00:30:08.980\nWhat was that?\n\n589\n00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.700\nYeah, anyways, you can see that\nthere are some different ones here.\n\n590\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.088\nMost of them are 1500 bytes.\n\n591\n00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:17.450\nRight here, wireless, 1484.\n\n592\n00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.190\nYep, there's the PTP,\n2304, and stuff like that.\n\n593\n00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.470\nSo, sometimes the MTU can be overwritten.\n\n594\n00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.311\nAnd you'll see this too in\nwhat they call jumbo frames,\n\n595\n00:30:26.311 --> 00:30:28.436\nbecause the 1500 byte MTU is the max.\n\n596\n00:30:28.436 --> 00:30:33.263\nSometimes they attempt to get\nmore information over the wire at\n\n597\n00:30:33.263 --> 00:30:37.728\none time by implementing what's\nknown as a jumbo frame and\n\n598\n00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:41.478\nthat brings the MTU up\nto around 9000 bytes.\n\n599\n00:30:41.478 --> 00:30:45.053\nThere's good and bad's about it,\nbecause our most common\n\n600\n00:30:45.053 --> 00:30:49.095\nswitching technique today is\nwhat's known as store and forward.\n\n601\n00:30:49.095 --> 00:30:53.750\nWe received the whole frame,\nwe look at what's known as the FCS,\n\n602\n00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.690\nthe Frame Checksum System,\nwhich is just making sure, hey,\n\n603\n00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.080\ncan we check the integrity of this frame?\n\n604\n00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.820\nIs it valid?\n\n605\n00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.400\nIs it good?\n\n606\n00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.550\nHas it maintained its integrity?\n\n607\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.420\nAnd then we forward it on.\n\n608\n00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.609\nOne of the things to keep in mind, is that\nyou have to do that every 1500 bytes, so\n\n609\n00:31:07.609 --> 00:31:10.507\nthere's a little bit of\ncomputational power that has to.\n\n610\n00:31:10.507 --> 00:31:12.715\nAnytime you have to check\nthe integrity of something,\n\n611\n00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:14.210\nyou're wasting processing cycle.\n\n612\n00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.303\nSo the theory behind it,\nthe thought process is,\n\n613\n00:31:17.303 --> 00:31:22.176\nif I can bump that up to 9000 bytes,\nthen I have to check less of the FCS's.\n\n614\n00:31:22.176 --> 00:31:28.490\nIt's always good in pro's and\ncon's, give and take.\n\n615\n00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.780\nThe problem with that is, guess what?\n\n616\n00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:36.010\nIf I take a 9000 byte frame and I check\nthat integrity check on the back of it and\n\n617\n00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.390\nit's bad, I'm not just\ndiscarding 1500 bytes anymore.\n\n618\n00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.250\nLike, I would be if it was just\nin the normal standard MTU,\n\n619\n00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.800\nnow I have to throw away 9000 bytes.\n\n620\n00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.740\nSo just like we talk about,\nin any computing there is give and takes.\n\n621\n00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.560\nYeah, if I leave it at 1500,\nI'm sending less data, but\n\n622\n00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.250\nI'm also throwing less data away\nif the integrity's not maintained.\n\n623\n00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.040\nYou increase a jumbo bytes, yes,\n\n624\n00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.390\nyou do have the ability to\nsend 9000 bytes at a time.\n\n625\n00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.840\nBut if the frame checksum sequence is\ncalculated and the CRC value isn't good\n\n626\n00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.420\nand it's discarded,\nyou're discarding a lot of information and\n\n627\n00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.670\nwe're gonna get those requests for\nre-transmission.\n\n628\n00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.470\nSo, those are some of the network traffic\nproperties that you gotta be aware of for\n\n629\n00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.010\nthe Network+ exam.\n\n630\n00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.210\nKeep in mind, if you wanna lot more\ndemonstrations and even some lab,\n\n631\n00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.360\nI guess, demonstrations here,\ncheck out the full Net+.\n\n632\n00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.730\nWe just wanna get you\nthere as fast as possible.\n\n633\n00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n634\n00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.460\nAll right, Wes, love it.\n\n635\n00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.480\nGood look there at Network properties or\nproperties of our network traffic.\n\n636\n00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.500\nWe thank you for that.\n\n637\n00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.850\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n638\n00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.660\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n639\n00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n640\n00:32:38.440

Coming at you live from San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:06.587\nCalifornia.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:08.441\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.061\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:12.432\n[MUSIC]\n\n7\n00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:13.453\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n8\n00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:16.090\nchoosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n9\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.420\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, and\nthis is Accelerated Net Plus.\n\n10\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.186\nAnd this episode is routing technologies.\n\n11\n00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:25.800\nAnd Wes Bryan has said to me, Zach,\nI want to help you learn more about it.\n\n12\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.531\nSo he's going to, here he is, Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey, Zach, thanks for\n\n13\n00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.260\nhaving me back.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're gonna dive into\n\n15\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.160\nthe routing technologies,\nlike Zach has talked about.\n\n16\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.670\nIf you have been following along\nin our accelerated Net Plus,\n\n17\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.070\nremember the OSI model we talked\nabout in another episode.\n\n18\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.440\nWe're gonna be talking about some\nof those layer three technologies,\n\n19\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.720\nwhere the routers sit.\n\n20\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.650\nAnd we're gonna talk about things like\nrouting protocols here, and basically,\n\n21\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.540\nsome of the concepts of\nhow routers make decisions\n\n22\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.302\nabout where to send their information.\n&gt;&gt; Now when we're talking about routing,\n\n23\n00:00:56.302 --> 00:01:00.380\nare we talking moving data and\nacross and in between networks,\n\n24\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.450\nis that what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is,\n\n25\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.630\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n26\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.790\nMy computer sends information, and\n\n27\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.000\nit doesn't really know how to\nget information across networks.\n\n28\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.350\nWe say source and\ndestination of a communication.\n\n29\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.360\nTypically, it's two endpoints and\nin the middle of those two endpoints,\n\n30\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.630\nwe have redistribution points.\n\n31\n00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.357\nDown there at layer one we have things\nlike hubs, that we've talked about,\n\n32\n00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:23.116\nthat are really just dumb devices.\n\n33\n00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.065\nThey're really nothing\nmore than like a repeater.\n\n34\n00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:29.715\nThey just broadcast information\nout of all of their ports, but\n\n35\n00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.977\nthey don't really make\nany logical decisions.\n\n36\n00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:34.147\nSwitches on the other hand,\nnow we move up the stack.\n\n37\n00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:36.287\nUp the protocol stack,\nthe OSI model, if you will.\n\n38\n00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:39.547\nAnd now we're talking about things\nlike switches that can start to\n\n39\n00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:43.587\nforward information between nodes\nwithin a local area network.\n\n40\n00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:44.237\nBut remember,\n\n41\n00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:48.890\na switch is only aware of the devices\nthat are directly connected to its ports.\n\n42\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.760\nEven if it's another switch, it still has\nto have a port to port connection in order\n\n43\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.510\nto send information along the wire.\n\n44\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.570\nWire just being figurative for\n\n45\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.560\nthe network.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n46\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.575\n&gt;&gt; But then when we move up into layer\n\n47\n00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:02.780\nthree, now that's where we get\nthings like logical addressing.\n\n48\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.171\nLike IP addresses, we start looking\nat things like network IDs.\n\n49\n00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:09.820\nAnd routers are intelligent,\nrouters don't need to be connected.\n\n50\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.390\nThey do not need to be connected to\na network to send that information.\n\n51\n00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.320\nTo make a decision,\nto look at a routing table and\n\n52\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.180\nsay hey I've got this database\nof networks that I'm aware of.\n\n53\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.700\nOr paths, if you will,\n\n54\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.410\nthese routes that I'm aware of to send\ninformation to a certain direction.\n\n55\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.440\nAnd based on what I find in that table\n\n56\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.485\nis gonna dictate where I'm gonna send this\ninformation to get to the remote network.\n\n57\n00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:37.853\nIn fact, it's really routing\nthat allows us to communicate,\n\n58\n00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.023\nyou and I, right now, to communicate.\n\n59\n00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:41.943\nAnd I know its a one-way communication,\nif you will,\n\n60\n00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:43.965\nbecause you're not really\ncommunicating back with me.\n\n61\n00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:47.145\nBut if you're watching this, and\nobviously you have an internet connection,\n\n62\n00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:49.170\nwell it's the routers that\nallow that to happen.\n\n63\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.650\nSo, these are the work horses when\nit comes to WAN communications,\n\n64\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.623\nacross different networks.\n\n65\n00:02:55.623 --> 00:02:57.706\nAnd it really doesn't have\nto be a WAN communication,\n\n66\n00:02:57.706 --> 00:02:59.180\nit can be an autonomous system.\n\n67\n00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.686\nAutonomous system, if you will,\nis just a network, if you will,\n\n68\n00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:07.718\nthat is under the control of\na single administrative body.\n\n69\n00:03:07.718 --> 00:03:12.390\nAnd it typically adheres to\na certain routing protocol.\n\n70\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.463\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind is,\nthat's really what the internet is,\n\n71\n00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:18.533\nit's a bunch of local area networks all\n\n72\n00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:19.710\nholding hands\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n73\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.578\n&gt;&gt; And it's the routers that allow them to\n\n74\n00:03:21.578 --> 00:03:24.930\ntalk to one another, and essentially\nallows you to watch this video.\n\n75\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.675\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into routing technologies.\n\n76\n00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:34.164\nNow, remember one of the first\nthings that we want to talk about\n\n77\n00:03:34.164 --> 00:03:39.025\nis that routing protocols if you will,\nthey define how routers share information.\n\n78\n00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:42.585\nI told you that they look at a database,\nit's called a routing table.\n\n79\n00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:45.605\nWell how that table gets\nbuilt with the routes or\n\n80\n00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:49.225\nthe paths that its gonna send\nthe information out of it's various\n\n81\n00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:52.370\ninterfaces, really can happen\nin a few different ways.\n\n82\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.990\nAnd it depends on the protocol\nthat you're using that defines\n\n83\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.860\nhow that table gets built.\n\n84\n00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.199\nRouting protocols, if you will, they can\nbe called a couple of different things.\n\n85\n00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.820\nIn fact, I got a little diagram here,\nlet's kinda check this out.\n\n86\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.410\nBecause we have a couple of different\ntypes of routing protocols generically.\n\n87\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.560\nWe've got quite a few different,\n\n88\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.430\nI guess, kinds of routing protocols,\nflavors, if you will.\n\n89\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.850\nBut we primarily have two different types.\n\n90\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.950\nAnd what I mean by that is\nwe have routing protocols\n\n91\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.810\nthat route information within an\nautonomous system or within your networks.\n\n92\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.688\nAnd then we have routing protocols\nthat actually allow the networks to\n\n93\n00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:32.551\ncommunicate.\n\n94\n00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:35.330\nSo you can have a heavily\nrouted environment.\n\n95\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.190\nIf you have a large\nenterprise environment,\n\n96\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.030\nyou're gonna probably\nhave multiple subnets.\n\n97\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.815\nRemember what routers do, they route\ntraffic based on the logical identifier\n\n98\n00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:46.063\nknown as IP between\nthose different subnets.\n\n99\n00:04:46.063 --> 00:04:49.480\nWell the same thing goes,\nif you will, across the internet.\n\n100\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.880\nBut in an internal network you could\nhave many, many different networks,\n\n101\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.000\nmany subnets.\n\n102\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.400\nAnd those protocols that route traffic\nwith inside your autonomous systems,\n\n103\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.410\nwith inside of those routed environments\nare what are known as interior\n\n104\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.230\ngateway protocols, IGPs if you will.\n\n105\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.250\nAnd we'll talk about the different\nvarious IGPs because\n\n106\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.048\nagain they have different flavors.\n\n107\n00:05:13.048 --> 00:05:16.470\nThey all kinda fall under that\numbrella term, if you will,\n\n108\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.120\ncalled an interior gateway protocol.\n\n109\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.920\nNow if I need to send information\nbetween these networks across like a WAN\n\n110\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.110\nlinked to different networks, then what we\nuse is something a little bit different.\n\n111\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.650\nWe use what's known as\nan exterior gateway protocol.\n\n112\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.280\nNotice that, what this does is this\nallows the two different networks again\n\n113\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.070\nto communicate when,\nlet's say Zack has one autonomous system.\n\n114\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:46.110\nHe works for company, and they have all of\ntheir routers, routing information inside.\n\n115\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.290\nThose are the interior gateway protocols.\n\n116\n00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.350\nI have an autonomous system, again just a\ncollection of networks or single network.\n\n117\n00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.170\nCould be a single network, a lot of\ntimes they're really big, for instance,\n\n118\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.490\nApple has an autonomous system.\n\n119\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.440\nAnd I can almost guarantee you there's\nnot just a single network within Apple's\n\n120\n00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.070\nmassive infrastructure.\n\n121\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.260\nSo within Apple's infrastructure, they\nhave their interior gateway protocols.\n\n122\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.260\nLet's say my company wants to talk\nover the internet, through or\n\n123\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.440\nto, Zach's network.\n\n124\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.460\nWell now what we're using is\nexterior gateway protocols.\n\n125\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.210\nAgain, the exterior gateway protocols\nroute traffic between autonomous systems.\n\n126\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.060\nNow the other thing to keep in mind\nis that interior gateway protocols,\n\n127\n00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.670\nthey don't share information\nwith other autonomous systems.\n\n128\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.050\nThey keep that information\nto themselves internally,\n\n129\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.590\nand hence why they're\ncalled interior gateway.\n\n130\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.076\nThink of your router, if I'm gonna\nroute traffic to another network,\n\n131\n00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:48.410\nto another company's network, I'm going\nto use exterior gateway protocol.\n\n132\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.440\nInside of my routed environment I'm\ngonna use interior gateway protocols\n\n133\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.350\nthat are only gonna communicate between\nthose routers within the interior,\n\n134\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.250\nthe other side of the gateway,\nif you will.\n\n135\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.890\nIf I need to communicate with\nZach's network, my internal or\n\n136\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.480\ninterior gateway routers,\n\n137\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.970\nthey are not going to communicate their\nrouting information to Zach's network.\n\n138\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.250\nIt's a different administrative body.\n\n139\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.430\nIf we need to communicate between us,\n\n140\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.310\nwe're gonna use the exterior\ngateway protocol.\n\n141\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.010\nSo understand basically that\nthat's kinda the basics of what\n\n142\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.460\nthe protocols are doing.\n\n143\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.120\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's define routes as well.\n\n144\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.050\nBecause we gotta kinda talk about routes.\n\n145\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.969\nNow, there's a couple of different\nways that you can obtain routes.\n\n146\n00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:41.310\nNow, routes can either be dynamic,\nor they could be static.\n\n147\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.490\nNow, if we talk about dynamic routes,\n\n148\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.810\nthat's where those interior\ngateway protocols come in handy.\n\n149\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.440\nBecause what happens is the routers\ncommunicate with one another.\n\n150\n00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.905\nThey share typology information.\n\n151\n00:07:56.905 --> 00:08:01.644\nAnd every router must be consistent\nwith sharing that typology information.\n\n152\n00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:02.745\nThose are dynamic routes.\n\n153\n00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:06.510\nCuz it means, let's say now\nZach's a router and I'm a router.\n\n154\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.588\nWe're gonna put your routing hat on.\n\n155\n00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:09.870\nWe'll put our routing hats on right?\n\n156\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.420\nAnd I learn of a route, or\nZach as a router learns of a route, right?\n\n157\n00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.930\nZach's gonna come over and\nhe's gonna say, hey,\n\n158\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.490\nWes, I know a route to\nget to this network.\n\n159\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.660\nAnd I'm going to say, well, Zach,\nthanks for the information,\n\n160\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.930\nbut I already got that route.\n\n161\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.850\nBut wait a second.\n\n162\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.580\nZach, I'm looking at your information,\nyou got a better way to get there.\n\n163\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.090\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\npurge that route out of my database,\n\n164\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.190\nmy routing table.\n\n165\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.743\nAnd I'm gonna accept that route\nthat you have found there, Zach,\n\n166\n00:08:36.743 --> 00:08:39.923\nthat is a better choice to get\nto that destination network.\n\n167\n00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:43.480\nAnd that's how we've dynamically\nbuilding up the routing table.\n\n168\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.139\n&gt;&gt; So dynamic means flexibility,\n\n169\n00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:46.785\ndoesn't it?\n&gt;&gt; It really does, and\n\n170\n00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:47.801\nthat's a good thing.\n\n171\n00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:51.081\nSo hold to that flexibility cuz we gonna\ncome right back to that cuz we're come\n\n172\n00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:53.604\nright back to that cuz we gotta\ndifferentiate it with static\n\n173\n00:08:53.604 --> 00:08:54.720\nroutes as well.\n\n174\n00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.570\nNow, static routes are those\nroutes that are set manually\n\n175\n00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.500\nby the administrator, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.310\nAnd what that says is, Zach, I only have,\n\n177\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.310\nlet's say,\none route going into this network.\n\n178\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.780\nI really don't need to communicate\nwith you on how to get there.\n\n179\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.760\nI'm the only one connected\nto that network.\n\n180\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.538\nSo there's no reason to waste\nthings like raw processing power,\n\n181\n00:09:14.538 --> 00:09:17.240\nif you will, or the communications.\n\n182\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.910\nBecause when a router needs to make a\ndecision, it's gonna use some of its CPU,\n\n183\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.980\nit's gonna use some of its memory.\n\n184\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.410\nAnd when there is communications\nbetween the routers,\n\n185\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.160\nupdating things like routing tables,\nthat takes processing power, right?\n\n186\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.760\nBut there's no reason to say if I'm\nonly connected to a single network with\n\n187\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.130\none link, there's no reason\nto waste that power, right?\n\n188\n00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.020\nWhat I can do is I can define\na static route if there's\n\n189\n00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.120\nonly one route into that network.\n\n190\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.490\nNow, let's go back to flexibility,\nall right?\n\n191\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.410\nThe problem, the benefit of the static\nroute is the fact that you eliminate\n\n192\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.300\nthe necessity to calculate a routing\ntable because what you do when you define\n\n193\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.270\na static route is you're saying router,\nI don't care what the routing table is,\n\n194\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.302\nthis is the route you're going to use,\nall right?\n\n195\n00:10:00.302 --> 00:10:01.720\nAnd that has its benefits.\n\n196\n00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.960\nBut here's the problem.\n\n197\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.080\nIf that route fails, all right,\nsince it isn't dynamic, I'm not going\n\n198\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.650\nto turn around and ask Zack, well, I don't\nknow how to get to that network, Zach.\n\n199\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.360\nI know I told you to hush before,\nand I don't need your advice, but\n\n200\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.770\nI'm not going to reach out and\nask for them.\n\n201\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.580\nStatically defined routes, we don't\ndynamically build the routing tables,\n\n202\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.310\nwhich means it's good for processing\npower but bad when the route fails,\n\n203\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.090\nbecause the router's going to still\ntry to use that route, right?\n\n204\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.650\nNow, flexibility, and\nback to Zach's comment is right on point,\n\n205\n00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.692\nis the fact that a dynamic route,\nlet's say a route does fail, all right?\n\n206\n00:10:38.692 --> 00:10:43.299\nHere's where that flexibility comes in,\nis the fact that if that route fails,\n\n207\n00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:46.806\nthis router can communicate\nwith this router and say, hey,\n\n208\n00:10:46.806 --> 00:10:49.720\ndo you still know how\nto get to that network?\n\n209\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.600\nAnd this router, 3 in this case, can\nsay hey, router 4, I don't know exactly\n\n210\n00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.880\nhow to get to the network that router 1 is\nattached to, but I did talk to router 2.\n\n211\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.040\nAnd router 2 said hey,\nif you need to get to router 1,\n\n212\n00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.610\njust send the information to me and\nI'll get it there.\n\n213\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.860\nAnd then this router says,\nokay, well, that helps me out.\n\n214\n00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.690\nLet me put that route in my table even\nthough this route is broke, right,\n\n215\n00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.140\noffline, and I'll send it to router 3,\nwhich will send it to router 2,\n\n216\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.150\nwhich will send it back to router 1,\nright?\n\n217\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:24.320\nSo, that is the flexibility like you're\nsaying, of these dynamic routes, too.\n\n218\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.070\nAgain, dynamically, well,\ncuz topologies can change, right?\n\n219\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.693\nA link can go offline or\nit can be unreliable.\n\n220\n00:11:30.693 --> 00:11:33.240\nAnd if it's unreliable and\nit goes offline,\n\n221\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.540\nwe need a way to recalculate, a way to\nget that information to its endpoint.\n\n222\n00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.550\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about some of\n\n223\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.660\nthe IGPs that you need to be aware of,\nthe Interior Gateway Protocols,\n\n224\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.940\nthat you need to be aware of\nwhen it comes to your Net+ exam.\n\n225\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.934\nThe very first one that we're gonna\ntalk about, and it's kinda interesting.\n\n226\n00:11:52.934 --> 00:11:55.192\nThey generically, they mention RIP.\n\n227\n00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:56.508\nWe don't really use RIP anymore.\n\n228\n00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:59.878\nIn fact, we really don't use RIP\nversion two either because of some of\n\n229\n00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:03.900\nthe problems, it's kind of problematic and\nI'll explain what I mean here.\n\n230\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.330\nBut I went ahead and put both RIP and\nRIP version two in here, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.780\nRIP stands for\nthe Routing Information Protocol.\n\n232\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.290\nAnd you can only imagine RIP version two,\nit's exactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n233\n00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.040\nIt's the second version that they tried\nto overcome some of the shortcomings,\n\n234\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.350\nif you will, of the earlier RIP protocol\nbecause Routing Information Protocol was\n\n235\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.845\na very long running protocol.\n\n236\n00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:29.825\nIt goes back to the days before\nthe Internet even existed.\n\n237\n00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:31.266\nIt goes back to the days of the ARPA net,\n\n238\n00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:33.985\nright, when the Defense Advance\nResearch Project Agency and\n\n239\n00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:36.745\na handful of universities\nwere really developing\n\n240\n00:12:36.745 --> 00:12:40.605\nthe packet switching networks that\nwould later become the Internet.\n\n241\n00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:44.195\nIt was used mainly in homogeneous networks\n\n242\n00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:47.045\nwhere the routers were\nthe same type of router.\n\n243\n00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:51.410\nAnd it really doesn't scale too well,\n20 to 30 routers, right?\n\n244\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:57.490\nI know one of our hosts here used to work\nat a bank, and one of the things that he\n\n245\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.470\nhad to do was kind of summarize 900 routes\nI think is what he had told me one time.\n\n246\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.510\nThat's a massive network, right?\n\n247\n00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.100\nRIP would not handle\na network of that size.\n\n248\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.280\nNow, how does RIP build its information,\nall right?\n\n249\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.180\nWell, it does it something through\nwhat's known as RIP response messages.\n\n250\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.339\nAnd essentially, what happens is, and\nlet me show you a little diagram here,\n\n251\n00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:23.750\nso we've got kind of\na generic topology right?\n\n252\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.350\nAnd what RIP does and version two, and\n\n253\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.830\nI'll tell you the difference\nbetween version two coming up.\n\n254\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.129\nBut they basically kinda work the same,\nright?\n\n255\n00:13:32.129 --> 00:13:37.070\nRouter 1 is essentially going to send\na RIP response message to its neighbors.\n\n256\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.412\nAnd that's important to understand,\nall right?\n\n257\n00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:45.500\nRouter 1 here doesn't talk directly to\nRouter 3 unless it's connected to it.\n\n258\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:51.200\nIn RIP and RIP version two, the routers\nonly talk to their neighbors, right?\n\n259\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.100\nThe neighbor routers, the ones that\nthey're directly connected to.\n\n260\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.970\nAnd it does that, again, by sending or\nsharing that information,\n\n261\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.080\nit's routing table,\nevery 30 seconds, all right?\n\n262\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.590\nNow, that might sound like a good thing,\nand, well, it's kind of not, right?\n\n263\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.741\nIf Zach, let's say Zach, again,\nwe're gonna go back to the routers,\n\n264\n00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:12.910\nZach and I are routers, right?\n\n265\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.270\nIf Zach doesn't learn any new information,\nI'm still sending him my routing table,\n\n266\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.440\nand he's still sending\nme his routing table.\n\n267\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.200\nEven if information doesn't change.\n\n268\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.570\nAnd every time you send me\nthe information, I got to look and\n\n269\n00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.930\nprocess the routes and find out has\nanything changed, and discard it, well,\n\n270\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.850\nif no changes have been made, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.670\nAnd again, that can become\nkind of problematic, right?\n\n272\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.450\nThe other thing, too, is that if a,\nlet's say, let me give a link down here.\n\n273\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.160\nLet's say a link fails, all right?\n\n274\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.030\nThis router doesn't become aware of it\nuntil Router 3 talks to this router,\n\n275\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.740\nwhich talks to this router,\nwhich talks to this router.\n\n276\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.350\nAnd you can kinda see the redundancy\ncoming up here, which talks to Router 4.\n\n277\n00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.300\nAgain, they only talk to their neighbors.\n\n278\n00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.590\nSo they don't talk directly to Router 1.\n\n279\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.690\nAnd then this one, so forth, sequentially,\nuntil we get back to Router 1.\n\n280\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.010\nAnd then Router 1 is now aware\nthat that link is offline, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.130\nThat's what's known as convergence,\nall right?\n\n282\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.960\nConvergence sounds like such\na such a technical term.\n\n283\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.180\nIt's not.\n\n284\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.150\nWhat it means is convergence\nis the time that it takes for\n\n285\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.770\na change in the network topology,\nin this case the link fails, and\n\n286\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.140\nthe time when every router is now\naware that that link has failed.\n\n287\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.520\nLike, for instance, Router 1, right?\n\n288\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.500\nBut again, once Router 1 finally knows\nabout it, we still aren't converged.\n\n289\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.070\nConverged is when we all\nagree on the topology.\n\n290\n00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.340\nWe have the current information.\n\n291\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.000\nConvergence is the process that\nit takes to get to that point.\n\n292\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.870\nWell, we're still not converged, right?\n\n293\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.200\nRouter 2 still hasn't learned about it.\n\n294\n00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.930\nRouter 1 hasn't learned about it, right?\n\n295\n00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.062\nAnd we could say that it goes\nback this way, too, right?\n\n296\n00:15:52.062 --> 00:15:57.290\nSo again, it has a very slow\nconvergent type, all right?\n\n297\n00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.104\nNow, the other thing about it is how\ndoes it make a choice on where to send\n\n298\n00:16:01.104 --> 00:16:02.577\nthe information, right?\n\n299\n00:16:02.577 --> 00:16:07.138\nWe say that the whole purpose of routing\nis to determine the best path to\n\n300\n00:16:07.138 --> 00:16:09.781\ntake to get the data where it needs to go.\n\n301\n00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:12.156\nAll right, well, it does that if you will,\n\n302\n00:16:12.156 --> 00:16:16.290\nby looking at what all routing protocols\nuse, what's known as a metric.\n\n303\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.300\nAnd a metric defines the cost that\nit takes to get to that network.\n\n304\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.107\nThe shorter the cost, the better the\nroute, the more preferred the route is.\n\n305\n00:16:25.107 --> 00:16:28.569\nThe other thing to understand is that\nin a routing table only a single\n\n306\n00:16:28.569 --> 00:16:30.550\nroute is present, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.370\nSo RIP uses hop counts, right?\n\n308\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.158\nSo if you look here,\nwe've got a series of routers, right, and\n\n309\n00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:38.080\nlet's say we needed to\nget to router three.\n\n310\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.630\nWell there's a couple of paths, right,\nalmost sounds like a Led Zepplin song,\n\n311\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.340\nthere's two paths you can go by here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.560\n&gt;&gt; But if you'll notice we have, and\n\n313\n00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.440\nlet me define what a hop is.\n\n314\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.390\nA hop is the process of forwarding\ntraffic from one router to the next.\n\n315\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.170\nIf I forward myself to Zach,\nthat's one hop.\n\n316\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.150\nThis is what's know as a distance\nvector protocol, that's what RIP is.\n\n317\n00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.585\nAnd RIP basically works by\nlooking at the hop count.\n\n318\n00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:05.720\nAnd it makes its decision.\n\n319\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.660\nLet's say we have to get to network A.\n\n320\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.330\nWell if we look at network A, well,\nthere's a few ways we could go, right?\n\n321\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.460\nWe can go this way from Router 1 to\nRouter 4 to Router 4 to Router 3,\n\n322\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.853\nbut notice that if we add\nup the hop counts, right?\n\n323\n00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:25.903\n3 + 4 is 7 but if we look over here,\n2 + 3 is 5, right?\n\n324\n00:17:25.903 --> 00:17:29.970\nSo this isn't gonna be the path\nthat that Router 1 takes.\n\n325\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.530\nIt's gonna take that better,\nlower cost route, right?\n\n326\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.490\nSo it's going to take 5 hops instead.\n\n327\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.058\nThe other limitations of RIP is the fact\nthat it's got a maximum of 15 hops,\n\n328\n00:17:41.058 --> 00:17:41.700\nalright?\n\n329\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:47.230\nThat's it, anything that's beyond 16 is,\n16 hop count means basically the network,\n\n330\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:51.100\nthe destination is unreachable, and it\ndoesn't even put that route in its table.\n\n331\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.700\nAll right,\nthat's a distance vector protocol.\n\n332\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.795\nOne of the things that I do want\nyou to understand is that it can't\n\n333\n00:17:58.795 --> 00:18:02.415\nhandle variable-length subnet masks,\nRIP didn't.\n\n334\n00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.701\nRIP 2 got around some of the limitations,\n\n335\n00:18:04.701 --> 00:18:08.514\nit would support variable length\nsubnet masks, it would also allow for\n\n336\n00:18:08.514 --> 00:18:11.964\nauthentication and\nIncluding things like multicast routing.\n\n337\n00:18:11.964 --> 00:18:16.904\nThe problem with it is it retains some\nof the slow convergence times, right,\n\n338\n00:18:16.904 --> 00:18:20.080\nand then also the hop count limitation.\n\n339\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.240\nSo another one that was introduced was,\nactually well, there's a couple of them.\n\n340\n00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.040\nOne you don't have to worry about for\nthe exam going way back.\n\n341\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.183\nThis is a Cisco proprietary\nrouting protocol.\n\n342\n00:18:30.183 --> 00:18:32.135\nAnd it's called EIGRP, and\n\n343\n00:18:32.135 --> 00:18:36.207\nthat's the enhanced interior\ngateway routing protocol.\n\n344\n00:18:36.207 --> 00:18:41.405\nIt's the successor to their earlier\nproprietary protocol which was just IGRP,\n\n345\n00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:44.370\ninterior gateway routing protocol.\n\n346\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.450\nIt is basically an IGP.\n\n347\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.787\nIt was originally deployed that way.\n\n348\n00:18:49.787 --> 00:18:54.017\nIt's largely used that way, but\nit could also be used as an EGP too,\n\n349\n00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:56.032\nan exterior gateway protocol.\n\n350\n00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:58.170\nHowever, it's commonly used as an IGP.\n\n351\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.897\nIt uses distance vector technology,\nso things like hop counts.\n\n352\n00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:06.622\nBut it can also look at things\nlike bandwidth, any delay or\n\n353\n00:19:06.622 --> 00:19:11.830\nlatency if you will, load utilization,\nas well as the reliability of the link.\n\n354\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.448\nAnd that's why they call it enhanced,\nI mean it has a lot of benefits, but\n\n355\n00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.220\nit is a Cisco proprietary implementation.\n\n356\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:25.261\nNow that is in contrast to another common\nrouting protocol type, that's used.\n\n357\n00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:28.940\nAnd that, more common today is what's\nknown as a link state routing protocol.\n\n358\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.130\nRemember, when we say link state,\nI want you to change the name around and\n\n359\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.010\nunderstand that it's the state of the link\nthat it's actually looking at, and\n\n360\n00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.290\nthat's something known as\nopen shortest path first.\n\n361\n00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.753\nNow open shortest path first is another\none that's been around for a while.\n\n362\n00:19:41.753 --> 00:19:46.329\nAnd it goes back to 1991, and\nroutes are basically chosen\n\n363\n00:19:46.329 --> 00:19:51.470\nbased on the state of the router's\ninterface, if you will.\n\n364\n00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.342\nAnd the quality of the route.\n\n365\n00:19:53.342 --> 00:19:57.350\nIt doesn't have a hop count limitation, so\nlet me give you kind of an example, right?\n\n366\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:02.240\nWhere we were looking at things like for\ninstance, hop counts on distance vector,\n\n367\n00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.405\nwhat we can take a lot of more\nthings into consideration.\n\n368\n00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:09.195\nAgain, what is the bandwidth of the link,\nright?\n\n369\n00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:13.005\nSo if I was getting down to this route\nfrom this router to this router, right?\n\n370\n00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:17.705\nYou notice we have a 56K line here,\nwe've got 100 Mb and 10 Gb line.\n\n371\n00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:21.795\nWell, OSPF isn't going to choose this\nroute here because of the fact that\n\n372\n00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:23.455\nwe've got 56K and 100 Mg.\n\n373\n00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:26.788\nIf you look we've got 100 MB and\na 10 GB link here,\n\n374\n00:20:26.788 --> 00:20:29.110\nit's gonna choose that faster path.\n\n375\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.549\nSo open shortest path first.\n\n376\n00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:34.168\nAgain, this is a link state routing\nprotocol that actually uses the quality\n\n377\n00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:35.420\nand the state of the link.\n\n378\n00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.332\nIt's one of the ways I like to\nhelp people to remember it.\n\n379\n00:20:39.332 --> 00:20:42.720\nNow the other thing too is\nit converges a lot quicker.\n\n380\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.506\nIt doesn't initially.\n\n381\n00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:48.514\nInitially what it does, is all the routers\nflood the whole entire network,\n\n382\n00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:50.340\nrather than just your neighbors.\n\n383\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.890\nEverybody just stands up like\na party line like you talked\n\n384\n00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.580\nabout in-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n385\n00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Other episodes and\n\n386\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.740\njust says hey, everybody,\nwe're all talking.\n\n387\n00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.890\nWe're all sharing information.\n\n388\n00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.800\nNow, where it starts to outperform\n\n389\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.520\nten times over when it comes to things\nlike RIP is because once a route changes,\n\n390\n00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.910\nit's only the route that is actually\ncommunicated with the other routes.\n\n391\n00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.843\nNot like in RIP,\nwhere whether anything's changed or not,\n\n392\n00:21:13.843 --> 00:21:17.306\nI'm still gonna pass off every 30\nseconds the entire routing table.\n\n393\n00:21:17.306 --> 00:21:19.420\nSo it converges a lot quicker.\n\n394\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.170\nNow the next one that we have is\n\n395\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.710\nwhat is known as the exterior\ngateway protocol, right?\n\n396\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.900\nAnd this is actually how we route\ninformation across the internet\n\n397\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.800\nbetween autonomous systems.\n\n398\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.260\nAnd it uses something known\nas Border Gateway Protocol.\n\n399\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.820\nIf we can look here we've got BGP.\n\n400\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.701\nWhat you have are Border Gateway Routers,\nright?\n\n401\n00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:47.210\nOn the inside of the autonomous system is\nyour interior gateway routing protocol.\n\n402\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.200\nOr your interior gateway routers\nusing those IGPs, right?\n\n403\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.860\nThose interior gateway protocols.\n\n404\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.780\nNotice how we don't see\nthem in the diagram?\n\n405\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.690\nThat's because interior gateway protocols\ndon't broadcast their information to other\n\n406\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.674\nautonomous systems.\n\n407\n00:22:00.674 --> 00:22:05.330\nIn BGP, the only thing that communicates\nbetween those autonomous systems\n\n408\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.845\nare the border gateway routers.\n\n409\n00:22:07.845 --> 00:22:13.255\nThey share information, for instance,\nthings like routing policies if you will,\n\n410\n00:22:13.255 --> 00:22:16.445\nas well as, for instance,\nautonomous system numbers.\n\n411\n00:22:16.445 --> 00:22:21.400\nAnd you can actually go out on\nthe internet and, according to INA right,\n\n412\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.950\nInternet Assigned Numbering Authority,\nthey actually have a list of\n\n413\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.680\nthe autonomous system numbers\nthat are publicly accessible.\n\n414\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.358\nSo that is something to\nkeep in mind as well.\n\n415\n00:22:34.358 --> 00:22:38.802\nAll right, couple more things we want\nto take care of in this episode now.\n\n416\n00:22:38.802 --> 00:22:42.871\nWe did talk in other episodes\nhere about private IP addresses,\n\n417\n00:22:42.871 --> 00:22:47.660\nthat RFC 19 18, I know I've mentioned\nit in other episodes, right?\n\n418\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.370\nPrivate IP addresses can't be\nrouted across the internet.\n\n419\n00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:56.036\nWell in a 32 bit IP address space,\nwe don't have enough IP addresses.\n\n420\n00:22:56.036 --> 00:23:00.176\nSo one of the things that they said is,\nhey, let's come up with a way to kinda\n\n421\n00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:04.193\nstall the inevitable depletion of\nthat 32 bit IPv4 address space, and\n\n422\n00:23:04.193 --> 00:23:07.930\nthey came up with two things that\nare defined under RFC, 1918.\n\n423\n00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.960\nOne is the private IP addresses that we\ntalk about through the different classes,\n\n424\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.860\nand the other one is something known\nas network address translation.\n\n425\n00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.231\nNetwork address translation, very\nbasically, it's a mingling of the packets.\n\n426\n00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:23.326\nIt allows you to use a private\nIP address behind your gateway,\n\n427\n00:23:23.326 --> 00:23:27.670\nyour gateway router, and\nwhat the gateway router does.\n\n428\n00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.170\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll take a look here, all right.\n\n429\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.484\nSo notice that a packet has\ncome into the router, right?\n\n430\n00:23:34.484 --> 00:23:37.468\nAnd the router says,\nthat's a private IP address,\n\n431\n00:23:37.468 --> 00:23:40.270\nI can't route that out to the internet,\nright?\n\n432\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.518\nSo what it's gonna do is it's gonna\ntake its public IP address, and\n\n433\n00:23:44.518 --> 00:23:48.327\nit's going to put that in the IP\nheader of that information.\n\n434\n00:23:48.327 --> 00:23:50.246\nAnd then it's gonna take,\n\n435\n00:23:50.246 --> 00:23:56.180\nit'll remove essentially the private IP\naddress replacing its public IP address.\n\n436\n00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.354\nAnd now it's routable.\n\n437\n00:23:57.354 --> 00:24:00.316\nNow we can send that information\nacross the internet.\n\n438\n00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:04.556\nAnd when the information comes back in,\nit'll have the public IP address.\n\n439\n00:24:04.556 --> 00:24:07.279\nAnd also a port number.\n\n440\n00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:11.121\nAnd this is where we get into something\nnot only network address translation but\n\n441\n00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:14.161\nthere's also something known as\nport address translation and\n\n442\n00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:16.700\nit can keep track of\nthe different communications.\n\n443\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.950\nLike, well where's this going?\n\n444\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.900\nRemember the dynamic ports we\ntalk about in other episodes?\n\n445\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.250\nWell, you could see that high level\nport and that's assign to it and\n\n446\n00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.730\nsay, well okay,\nI see my Public IP Address, but\n\n447\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.160\nI also see a port here,\nI know what computer that goes to.\n\n448\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.910\nAnd what it does is it\nessentially removes that\n\n449\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.930\npublic IP address returns\nthe private IP address.\n\n450\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.180\nAnd then if it's using port address\ntranslation, it also knows the port,\n\n451\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.210\nit says, okay, I see the port,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n452\n00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.570\nforward this to the appropriate computer.\n\n453\n00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.680\nSo that's a little bit about\nnetwork address translation.\n\n454\n00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.430\nAnd, just keep in mind.\n\n455\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.820\nIt's essentially just a mingling of\nthe packet in front of the IP header.\n\n456\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.230\nAnd it's the replacing of the private\nIP address with a public IP address so\n\n457\n00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.700\nnow that it can be routed\nacross the internet.\n\n458\n00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.740\nIt has a database that it maintains\nof where that address came from so\n\n459\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.550\nit knows to switch it back.\n\n460\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.590\nIt's doing port address translation,\n\n461\n00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.870\nthen it can also pay attention\nto those high level ports.\n\n462\n00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.710\nAnd when the information comes\nback in other router it says\n\n463\n00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.730\nI see that high level port goes to this\ncomputer as part of that communication.\n\n464\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.970\nLet me go ahead and strip up the public IP\naddress, return the private IP address and\n\n465\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.780\nbased on that port,\nI know where to send that communication.\n\n466\n00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.080\nAll right, I know we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n467\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.270\nHere the last thing that I would like to\ntalk about just briefly is what is known\n\n468\n00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.430\nas port forwarding.\n\n469\n00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.460\nWhen we talk about port forwarding, this\nis based on those port numbers, right?\n\n470\n00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:46.550\nSometimes, when you need to send\na specific type of traffic,\n\n471\n00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.390\nbased on an application or something,\nto an individual node within your network.\n\n472\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.110\nWow, how do we do that, right?\n\n473\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.630\nWell, we do that with port forwarding.\n\n474\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.530\nAnd one of the ways that we do this a lot\nand you'll grow to learn and, hopefully,\n\n475\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:02.400\neven learn how to set it up, is with\nremote desktop protocol, RDP, right?\n\n476\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.310\nWhen I need to go make a connection\nover a public network back in to my home\n\n477\n00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.060\nnetwork, right.\n\n478\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.560\nI'm going to be using RDP in\na Windows environment, right?\n\n479\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.610\nWell that uses port 3389.\n\n480\n00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.080\nWhen it hits my router,\nand it sees port 3389,\n\n481\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.560\nhow does it know to send it to that one\ncomputer that I want to remote into,\n\n482\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.740\nif I have 1000,\n1500 computers on my network?\n\n483\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.990\nWell, it doesn't, so\nit wouldn't know what to do with it.\n\n484\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:28.280\nBut if I put a port forwarding rule for\n\n485\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.740\nport 3389 with the IP address so\nthe computer that I wanna talk to that\n\n486\n00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.910\nwhen the router receives the information\nit says, I see port 3389.\n\n487\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.360\nLet me look at my port forwarding rules.\n\n488\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.780\nOkay, I see that goes to 192.168.1.10,\narbitrary IP number.\n\n489\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.300\nLemme go ahead and send that communication\nright to the specific computer, right?\n\n490\n00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.860\nPort forwarding, it's a way that you can\n\n491\n00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.930\nforward information to a specific\nendpoint within your networks\n\n492\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.790\nbased on that port information that it\nfinds within the data packet, if you will.\n\n493\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:03.090\nThese are some of the routing\ntechnologies that we hope\n\n494\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.700\nmake a little bit more sense now.\n\n495\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.860\nAnd also help you on your NetPlus exam.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n496\n00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.390\nthey do make more sense\nbecause of you Wes.\n\n497\n00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.040\nThank you

glad to be back.\n\n9\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.580\nYep, that's right, we're gonna be looking\nat, well, some of the things that we can\n\n10\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.935\ndo to, well, optimize different\ntypes of traffic on our network.\n\n11\n00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.325\nAnd we really need that\nin modern networks,\n\n12\n00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:44.255\nbecause it isn't like just\nthe classic communications anymore.\n\n13\n00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.145\nIn fact, we've got traditional types\nof traffic, things like FTP and HTTP,\n\n14\n00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:52.365\nif you will, that have been on our\nnetworks for a very long time.\n\n15\n00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.920\nBut we got a lot of other\ntypes of traffic too,\n\n16\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.410\nand traffic that can't really\nhandle things like delay, right?\n\n17\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.932\nWe could slow FTP down a little\nbit if we needed to, right?\n\n18\n00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:07.150\nNow, we've got to ensure that we're using\nthings like transmission control protocol\n\n19\n00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.762\nthat maintains the integrity,\ncuz we're doing file transfers, right?\n\n20\n00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:14.330\nWe wanna make sure that that data\nstays in its original form, and\n\n21\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.100\ndoesn't get corrupted.\n\n22\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.400\nBut we could slow, well,\nfile transfer protocol, or\n\n23\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.910\neven HTTP, could stand to slow\ndown a little bit, right?\n\n24\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.330\nBut one of the things that we don't wanna\nslow down on is things like voice over IP\n\n25\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.350\ncommunications, right?\n\n26\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.271\nWhen you have things like SIP phones,\nH, what is it, 323,\n\n27\n00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:38.290\nyou have traffic like your\nvideo conferencing traffic.\n\n28\n00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.700\nSee, that traffic, it can handle\na moderate amount of things like packet\n\n29\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.150\nloss, but what it really doesn't\ntolerate real well is a delay,\n\n30\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.410\nit needs a very timely arrival, right.\n\n31\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.920\nFTP, on the other hand,\nwe don't really want packet loss, cuz\n\n32\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.760\nthat would corrupt the information, but\nit can handle a moderate amount of delay.\n\n33\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.948\nAnd if you look at your network,\n\n34\n00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:02.243\nyour network only has a certain\namount of bandwidth, right.\n\n35\n00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:07.202\nIt doesn't matter how big or how small\nthe network is, the pipeline is so\n\n36\n00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:12.260\nbig, and we've got to find a way In\nwhich we can prioritize, if you will.\n\n37\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.483\nThis type of traffic, well,\nwe can implement a little bit of delay, so\n\n38\n00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:17.980\nwe don't have to give it all\nof our network bandwidth.\n\n39\n00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.840\nAnd this type of traffic,\n\n40\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.646\nwe gotta make sure that we give\nit a high priority, right?\n\n41\n00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:25.830\nWe prioritize it in the fact that it's\ngonna get to the endpoint with less delay,\n\n42\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.540\nor very little delay, right.\n\n43\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.042\nSo that's some of the things that we're\ngonna talk about inside of this episode,\n\n44\n00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:36.152\nis some of the technologies that we have\nout there that they utilize in these\n\n45\n00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:37.211\nmodern networks.\n\n46\n00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:42.138\nIn order to guarantee that certain types\nof traffic get the amount of resources\n\n47\n00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:47.080\nwithin our networks that they need, so\nlet's go ahead and kinda define that.\n\n48\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.100\nNow there's layer two ways that\nwe can do this, right, and\n\n49\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.390\nthere's also layer three ways, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.380\nNow, in layer two implementations,\n\n51\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.270\nwe do this a little bit\ndifferent than layer three.\n\n52\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.117\nBut ultimately, whether you're\ntalking about the data link layer, or\n\n53\n00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:07.343\nyou're talking about layer three,\nthe networking layer.\n\n54\n00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:12.023\nIt's really about inserting a little\nbit of information into a certain field\n\n55\n00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:15.767\nwithin the data packet or within,\nif we are talking about IP or\n\n56\n00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:19.229\nwe're talking about layer three,\nor within the frame.\n\n57\n00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.250\nThat will allow these connectivity\ndevices to receive that information,\n\n58\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.288\ninspect those fields, and inspect\nthat little bit of extra information.\n\n59\n00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:31.492\nAnd make a determination based on that\ninformation as to whether it's high\n\n60\n00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:34.561\npriority, medium priority,\nmaybe low priority, or\n\n61\n00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:38.110\nmaybe we just don't care,\nbest effort, right?\n\n62\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.110\nSo that's some of the things\nthat we need to look at.\n\n63\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.899\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart with the layer two information, or\n\n64\n00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.118\nthe layer two techniques.\n\n65\n00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:48.222\nAnd when we talk about that,\nwe really kinda have to break down where\n\n66\n00:03:48.222 --> 00:03:52.620\nthis information resides, so\nyou can kind of see what's going on here.\n\n67\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.675\nSo let's go ahead and dive right into\nwhat an Ethernet frame looks like.\n\n68\n00:03:56.675 --> 00:04:00.780\nI've actually got just a small little\nbasic diagram here, there's nothing really\n\n69\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.230\nfancy about this, that describes what an\nEthernet frame will look like, all right.\n\n70\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.780\nWhen we look at a frame, it consists of\nwhat's known as a preamble, all right.\n\n71\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.850\nAnd a preamble, if you will,\nit's just out in front of the frame,\n\n72\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.139\nthat allows your clocks within\nyour devices, right, the receiver,\n\n73\n00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.850\nto be able to synchronize communications.\n\n74\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.790\nTime's very important, right, so we need\nto be able to synchronize information, and\n\n75\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.920\nthis is what that allows us to do.\n\n76\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.390\nThe next portion of this is\nwhat's known as a start of frame,\n\n77\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.620\nor sometimes called a start\nof frame delimiter.\n\n78\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.190\nAnd what that is is an 8-bit field,\nand it marks the end of the preamble.\n\n79\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.020\nAnd it says hey, your Ethernet frame\nis gonna start right after me, right?\n\n80\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.246\nSo it's kind of like that, again,\ndelimiter between what the preamble is,\n\n81\n00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:49.486\nand the actual fact that we've got,\nnow, data is going to start after that.\n\n82\n00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:53.150\nThen the next thing we have is\nthe source and destination MAC address.\n\n83\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.560\nRemember that when switches receive the\ninformation at layer two there, they're\n\n84\n00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.895\ngonna inspect the MAC address to figure\nout, which ports do I forward this to?\n\n85\n00:05:00.895 --> 00:05:04.915\nI received it on port, let's say 20, let\nme look at the destination MAC address.\n\n86\n00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:08.115\nOkay, I see that MAC address,\nlet me look at my MAC table and\n\n87\n00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:12.278\nfind out what port that that computer or\ndestination node is attached to, and\n\n88\n00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.471\nthen that's the port I'll send it out.\n\n89\n00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:19.610\nThen we have what's known as the ether\ntype, sometimes called the length as well.\n\n90\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.931\nAnd what that does is, it just\nindicates what protocol essentially is\n\n91\n00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:26.860\nencapsulated in the payload for the frame.\n\n92\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.950\nAnd it can also sometimes be\nused to denote the length.\n\n93\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.460\nSo you might hear it called ether type,\nyou might hear it called length, but\n\n94\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.950\nit let's you know what is the length\nof the frame sometimes as well.\n\n95\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.362\nWell, if you can't tell what the data is,\nthat's actually your payload, right.\n\n96\n00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:47.760\nThat's the information that we\nneed to move in between the nodes.\n\n97\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.530\nThe last portion of this, and well,\nthere might be padding, if it's needed.\n\n98\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.810\nThat's an optional thing,\n\n99\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.020\ndoesn't necessarily need to be there,\nso if needed.\n\n100\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.710\nAnd then the last portion is a checksum,\nall right?\n\n101\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.960\nThat's what's known as the frame\nchecksum sequence, if you will.\n\n102\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.420\nNow, that's just a 32-bit value,\nit's a CRC 32, cyclic redundancy check.\n\n103\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.100\nAnd remember that as far as performance of\nour switches go, remember that the most\n\n104\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.939\ncommon switching technique today is\nwhat's known as store and forward, right?\n\n105\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.100\nWhat the devices do is, they receive\nthe whole entire frame, they inspect\n\n106\n00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.350\nthe frame checksum sequence, or that CRC,\ncyclic redundancy check, 32-bit value.\n\n107\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.810\nAnd that tells us, well,\nhas that frame maintained its integrity?\n\n108\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.530\nWe're gonna store it, receive it,\n\n109\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.230\nget the frame checksum sequence,\nverify the integrity of the frame.\n\n110\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.130\nIf the frame has maintained its integrity,\nwe send it to the destination MAC address.\n\n111\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.082\nIf it hasn't, we discard it, and there's\ngonna be a callout for a retransmission,.\n\n112\n00:06:50.082 --> 00:06:54.960\nAll right, now,\nthat's a basic ethernet frame, all right.\n\n113\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.158\nNow, in other episodes, we've talked\nabout things like VLANs, right, and\n\n114\n00:07:00.158 --> 00:07:05.297\nVLANs use what's known as 802.1Q,\nthat's the VLAN tagging portion.\n\n115\n00:07:05.297 --> 00:07:07.808\nAll right, now what that means is,\n\n116\n00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:12.350\nwe're gonna insert a little bit\nof extra information, right?\n\n117\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.792\nSo what does that look like, well,\nthat kinda looks like this right here.\n\n118\n00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:22.290\nSo as we can see, when we compare a normal\nuntagged Ethernet frame with our 802.1Q.\n\n119\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.478\nYou can see, and my head's kinda covering\nthis up, that we add a little bit\n\n120\n00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:30.756\nof information here, right, and\nthat's that VLAN tagging unit, right.\n\n121\n00:07:30.756 --> 00:07:35.310\nNow, the VLAN tagging unit\nis actually broke down into\n\n122\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.260\nindividual portions as well.\n\n123\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.520\nAnd I wanna kinda talk about this, because\nthis is how we define a priority of\n\n124\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.490\ntraffic here at the switching level,\nright?\n\n125\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.770\nThe layer two information, if you will,\n\n126\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.900\nbecause it's a little bit different\nwhen we talk about layer three or IP.\n\n127\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.088\nInside of that 802.1Q VLAN tag,\nyou have a couple fields,\n\n128\n00:07:55.088 --> 00:07:58.363\nwell, four different fields, right?\n\n129\n00:07:58.363 --> 00:08:01.637\nYou have what's known as a tag type,\nall right, and\n\n130\n00:08:01.637 --> 00:08:06.639\nthe tag type just identifies the frame\nas being Well, tag or untagged, right?\n\n131\n00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.360\nAnd, we also have a priority.\n\n132\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.077\nNow this is where we start to\ntalk about guaranteeing different\n\n133\n00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:18.177\nlevels of resources based\non it's priority, right?\n\n134\n00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:21.560\nAnd this is something known as\ncost of service, all right?\n\n135\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.960\nCost of service again is the priority.\n\n136\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.810\nAnd there's gonna be numbers here\nthat dictate and let them switch,\n\n137\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.080\nno, all right?\n\n138\n00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.040\nNotice that it says cost of service here,\nwe can have.\n\n139\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.070\nWell, we can have a few different values.\n\n140\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.040\nSix and seven are reserved, right?\n\n141\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.730\nFive says hey, this is a voice,\nthis is voice data, right?\n\n142\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.030\nVoice over IP.\n\n143\n00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.460\nOr three would say, hey,\nthis is video conferencing, right?\n\n144\n00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.780\nThree would say hey,\nthis is call signaling,\n\n145\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.660\ntwo says hey this is high priority.\n\n146\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.657\nI do not care what type of traffic it is,\n\n147\n00:08:51.657 --> 00:08:53.968\njust get it to its end point quickly,\nright?\n\n148\n00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:57.113\nMedium priority and then a zero\nis like I said best effort right,\n\n149\n00:08:57.113 --> 00:08:59.453\nwe're gonna try and\nhope for the best, right?\n\n150\n00:08:59.453 --> 00:09:03.170\nSo that's what we see in\nthe layer two information when it\n\n151\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.100\ncomes to network performance, right?\n\n152\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.905\nWe talk about quality of service, right,\nquality of service QOS if you will.\n\n153\n00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:14.740\nIt's implemented in a few different ways,\nthat's more of the umbrella term, right?\n\n154\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.030\nAnd the way we guarantee that that\ninformation does get priority\n\n155\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:26.370\nis different between the different layers,\nlayer two and layer three.\n\n156\n00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.380\nThe last part of this here,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n157\n00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.040\njust for sake of completeness here, notice\nthat we still have two other fields.\n\n158\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.140\nThe canonical format indicator.\n\n159\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.460\nIt's typically set to zero for Ethernet.\n\n160\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.390\nAnd this was used, if you will, between\nEthernet and Token Ring-based networks for\n\n161\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.920\ncompatibility, but\nwe don't used Token Ring anymore.\n\n162\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.000\nThat's a legacy, old technology, so it's\ntypically just set to zero by default.\n\n163\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.100\nAnd then the last portion is,\nwell, what's so\n\n164\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.410\nimportant inside of VLAN tags\nis identifying which VLAN,\n\n165\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.970\nwithin this switch, that it should\nforward that information to?\n\n166\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.120\nRemember, VLANs allow us\nto take a single switch and\n\n167\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.370\nlogically divide it up\ninto more than one switch.\n\n168\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.470\nWell the VLAN ID identifies the VLAN\n\n169\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.100\nthat this communication is destined for.\n\n170\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.530\nAll right, that is your layer\ntwo cost of service, right?\n\n171\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.660\nBut then we have other ways, all right, so\n\n172\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.890\nanother thing we have to think about\nis when it comes to the layer three.\n\n173\n00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.400\nSee layer two information is\ngoing to use cost of service, but\n\n174\n00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.090\nlayer three information uses\nsomething a little bit different.\n\n175\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:41.713\nNow layer three used to use something\nknown as type of service all right?\n\n176\n00:10:41.713 --> 00:10:46.010\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlook at the layer three information too.\n\n177\n00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.020\nAll right, so this was a special\nfield that was reserved.\n\n178\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:55.380\nNow notice that what we end up having\nhere Is we have an IP packet, right.\n\n179\n00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.194\nNotice that we have a source and\ndestination IP here,\n\n180\n00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:03.961\nthe protocol tells what upper\nlayer protocols are encapsulated.\n\n181\n00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:07.818\nTTL is the time to live,\nsays how long this packet of\n\n182\n00:11:07.818 --> 00:11:13.155\ninformation is going to basically\nbe out there on the network.\n\n183\n00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:15.986\nThe version or link that's\ntypically set to 4, if you will.\n\n184\n00:11:15.986 --> 00:11:21.083\nType of service was a 8-bit field,\nall right?\n\n185\n00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:26.390\nAnd in that type of service, there was\nan old way that we used to do this.\n\n186\n00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.640\nWe used to do this with something\nknown as IP Precedence.\n\n187\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.490\nAnd then you can see in this 8\nbit field it would use 3 bits.\n\n188\n00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.670\nAnd the last 4 bits will basically just,\nthey remain unused.\n\n189\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.450\nWell the problem with 3 bits is it's kinda\n\n190\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.830\nlimiting in the amount of possibilities\nthat you can get in just 3 bits, right?\n\n191\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.962\nSo one of the ways that we do this\ntoday is what's known as DiffServ,\n\n192\n00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.215\nor more complete something known as DSCP.\n\n193\n00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.580\nI always wanna say DCSP.\n\n194\n00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.620\nDSCP, that's differentiated\nservice code point.\n\n195\n00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.418\nAll right, and it uses, you can see,\n\n196\n00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:11.330\n6 bits out of that 8 bit type of\nservice field to denote priority.\n\n197\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:17.260\nAnd well the other part of this, the last\ntwo bits, that you'll just see IPECN.\n\n198\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.570\nThat's actually what's known as\nan explicit congestion notification,\n\n199\n00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:24.189\ncuz i want you to think about\ntransmission control protocol, right?\n\n200\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.967\nHow do we know if something has gone\nwrong with transmission control protocol?\n\n201\n00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:33.461\nAll right, well that's when TCP says hey,\n\n202\n00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:38.850\nyou've lost a segment,\nI need you to resend that segment, right?\n\n203\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.310\nBut it's not until then that we\nrealize that there's a problem, right?\n\n204\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:48.720\nSo transmit this explicit congestion\nnotification is a way to kinda\n\n205\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.160\nget ahead of the game here and say hey,\nI'm not gonna to wait for transmission\n\n206\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.240\ncontrol protocol, if you will, to drop\na packet to find out something was wrong.\n\n207\n00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.350\nI'm gonna say hey, you know what,\n\n208\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.350\nwe sent this information and\nthe last time you sent it, it was slow.\n\n209\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.740\nThere's congestion on the network.\n\n210\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.870\nSo it defines congestion as well.\n\n211\n00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.080\nLet's go ahead now and\n\n212\n00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.200\nlet's kind of dive into the packets and\nsee what we find here.\n\n213\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.780\nIn fact I can kinda show\nyou the DSCP information.\n\n214\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.550\nAnd you can do this at home if you want.\n\n215\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.100\nJust download Wireshark,\nit's a free open source protocol analyzer.\n\n216\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.480\nSelect the network adapter\nthat you are working with, and\n\n217\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.110\nthen go ahead and start a capture.\n\n218\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.803\nSo what I'm gonna do here is,\nlet's see, I'm gonna use.\n\n219\n00:13:32.803 --> 00:13:37.880\nWhich one do I want to use, I'm gonna\nuse Thunderbolt Ethernet en here.\n\n220\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.840\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nstart a capture here.\n\n221\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.520\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nput a filter of my own IP address so\n\n222\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.670\nwe don't get all the extra information.\n\n223\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.320\nAnd I can really take any one.\n\n224\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.070\nI might be able to filter this\nout to transmission control\n\n225\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.280\nprotocol, there we go.\n\n226\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.860\nSo we have some transmission\ncontrol protocol information,\n\n227\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.690\nwhat I really wanna see is\nthe layer three information here.\n\n228\n00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.040\nAnd if we look at our, and in fact I\ncan go ahead and stop this capture,\n\n229\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.220\nwe've got enough information believe it or\nnot.\n\n230\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.478\nNotice here's my frame, right?\n\n231\n00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:10.740\nSo that shows me the encapsulation,\nright, you can see the frame length.\n\n232\n00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.836\nAnd if I collapse that down here's\nethernet, this is where we can see things\n\n233\n00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:19.590\nlike the destination MAC address that we\nwere talking about in the ethernet frame.\n\n234\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.340\nThe source MAC address as well.\n\n235\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.340\nBut then if I look under\nthe layer three information,\n\n236\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.340\nnotice we have Internet Protocol Version\n4, and I get my source and\n\n237\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.370\ndestination IP address,\nkinda like we seen in the diagram.\n\n238\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.920\nAnd if I expand this out, you're\ngonna see that there's a field here.\n\n239\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.925\nNotice this field right here,\ndifferentiated service field?\n\n240\n00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:38.780\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n241\n00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.830\n&gt;&gt; This is where differentiated service\ncode point sits, that information that we\n\n242\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.880\nwere talking about that defines\nif this has a high priority.\n\n243\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.090\nNow, I can see that its CS0, right?\n\n244\n00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.318\nThat CS0 means by default it's set to\nzero, it doesn't have a high priority,\n\n245\n00:14:53.318 --> 00:14:56.600\nit just means best effort delivery,\nkinda like we were talking about.\n\n246\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.200\nIt's just like any other normal traffic.\n\n247\n00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.250\nAnd if we expand this out, right?\n\n248\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.610\nWe can see\nthe Differentiated Service Codepoint and\n\n249\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.790\nthe Default (0), just best effort,\nbecause this is basically saying, hey,\n\n250\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.240\nthis is normal traffic, and it's\nnothing really special about it, right?\n\n251\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.140\nAnd the value would be set here,\nwhich would let the router know,\n\n252\n00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.342\nhey, this is high priority or\nit isn't high priority.\n\n253\n00:15:16.342 --> 00:15:19.030\nAnd then you can see that it\ndoesn't say IP in front of it,\n\n254\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.930\nbut you can see the ECN that\nI was talking about, right?\n\n255\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.040\nIt says explicit congestion notification.\n\n256\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.090\nThis lets the device know, right,\nthis is a slower link, right?\n\n257\n00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.320\nSo you can see that information\nright there in the packet\n\n258\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.250\njust by doing a quick capture.\n\n259\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.120\nNow, I will tell you that one\nof the things that we could do,\n\n260\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.930\nlet me go ahead and kinda close this down.\n\n261\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.810\nAnd I'm gonna continue without saving,\nall right?\n\n262\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.830\nIs that there are certain\nvalues that are set, right?\n\n263\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.083\nAnd I believe, let me see here.\n\n264\n00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:56.310\nYeah, so I'm on a Cisco website, and\nremember Network Plus is vendor neutral.\n\n265\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.735\nSo all I'm wanting to show you is\nthat there are different DSCP values,\n\n266\n00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:03.330\nyou do not have to know these for\nthe exam.\n\n267\n00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.281\nBut I hope that That it kinda conveys the\nmessage that we're trying to bring here.\n\n268\n00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:12.840\nAnd you could see that they have some of\nthe commonly used DSCP values, right.\n\n269\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.110\nNotice that this is Cisco's Nexus and\n\n270\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.790\nthen it says Quality of\nService Configuration Guide.\n\n271\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.240\nAnd if I look through here,\nyou can see that there are values, right?\n\n272\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.880\nYou can see the decimal value.\n\n273\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.690\nYou can see what the meaning is, right?\n\n274\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.950\nHigh priority, expedited forwarding.\n\n275\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.780\nWell, the other great thing about\nthat type of service didn't have\n\n276\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.700\nis what the drop probability is.\n\n277\n00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.090\nI can say it's high priority.\n\n278\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.810\nAnd it's got a very low\nprobability of being dropped.\n\n279\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.170\nSo you get control over there and\n\n280\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.730\nyou can see some of the different\nvalues that we have here, right?\n\n281\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:55.360\nAs well as some of the old 3 bit\nIP precedence values likewise.\n\n282\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.960\nBut again,\nwith the 3 bits here was kinda limiting.\n\n283\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.140\nSo, you can see that this is how you\nwould configure your devices if you were\n\n284\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.280\ngonna configure them\nwith quality of service.\n\n285\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.110\nAll right, one of the last couple of\nthings that I wanna talk about are some\n\n286\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.410\nthings that they mentioned here.\n\n287\n00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.540\nThey mentioned traffic shaping.\n\n288\n00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.760\nAll right, what is traffic shaping?\n\n289\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.580\nWell, traffic shaping if you will can be\nknown as package shaping, if you will.\n\n290\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:25.680\nIt can be bandwidth management and what\nthis does is it allows you to manipulate\n\n291\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.170\nand prioritize different network traffic.\n\n292\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.140\nYou prioritize with quality of service but\nwe can also do some manipulation.\n\n293\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.390\nAnd what we can do is we can\nreduce the heavy impact or\n\n294\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.920\nwe can reduce the impact of\nheavy bandwidth users, right?\n\n295\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.030\nYou got a lot of people streaming\nmedia on your network and\n\n296\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.350\nthey don't need to be doing that at work.\n\n297\n00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.550\nThey're consuming a lot of your bandwidth,\nright?\n\n298\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.760\nAnd that could be taking valuable network\nresources away from your line of business\n\n299\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.170\napplications, your servers,\nyour communication devices,\n\n300\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.850\nyour voice over IP phone.\n\n301\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.790\nSo what you can do is,\nyou can shape the traffic, if you will.\n\n302\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.570\nAnd that'll allow those\nheavy bandwidth users,\n\n303\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.080\nyou can reduce the amount of\nbandwidth that they're using and\n\n304\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.770\nit doesn't have an impact on\nother users within the network.\n\n305\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.710\nBut there's a couple of different\nways that we do this, right?\n\n306\n00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.920\nWe do it through what's known as shaping,\ntraffic shaping, or policing.\n\n307\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.600\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n308\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.360\nWith traffic shaping, what I did is,\nmy example here is just eight bits.\n\n309\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.040\nLet's say we set a limit of,\neight bits, all right, and\n\n310\n00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.690\nwe're gonna do traffic shaping.\n\n311\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.370\nWell what I've done is I've set\na policy that says you can only send\n\n312\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.670\neight bits of information at a time.\n\n313\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.780\nAll right, well, notice what happens.\n\n314\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.025\nHow does that affect\nus if we send six bit?\n\n315\n00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:41.504\n[CROSSTALK] Doesn't affect us, right?\n\n316\n00:18:41.504 --> 00:18:45.910\nBecause the policy says\nthe maximum is eight.\n\n317\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.110\nWell, what happens with seven?\n\n318\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.640\nNothing.\nIt doesn't affect us, right?\n\n319\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.760\nWhat happens if we send the maximum,\neight bits?\n\n320\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.160\nIt does absolutely nothing right?\n\n321\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.400\nIt doesn't affect us.\n\n322\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.190\nSo one of the things that we need to know\nis what happens when we have this pesky,\n\n323\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.860\nwell it's not pesky to us I guess,\npesky little ninth bit?\n\n324\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:08.660\nAll right, well with shaping,\nwhat it does is it takes that ninth bit.\n\n325\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.690\nAnd it puts it in a buffer, all right.\n\n326\n00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.560\nAnd it says, all right,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n327\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.180\nI'm going to allow this\ninformation to still be sent.\n\n328\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.790\nBut I'm going to put it in a buffer.\n\n329\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.700\nAnd when the network's free,\nthen we'll send that ninth bit.\n\n330\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.080\nSo you're shaping the traffic,\n\n331\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.020\nyou're telling it this is\nexactly how I want to be.\n\n332\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.618\nBut I want you to notice that's a big\ndifference than what we know as policing,\n\n333\n00:19:30.618 --> 00:19:32.270\nall right?\n\n334\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.670\nSo the same thing comes here, right?\n\n335\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.430\nWe've got that, again, policing.\n\n336\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.040\nWe say, eight bits is the maximum.\n\n337\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.170\nAnything under that we're not\ngoing to be affected by it.\n\n338\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.670\nBut the difference between policing and\n\n339\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:48.240\nshaping, what happens when that\npesky ninth bit comes into play?\n\n340\n00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.040\nWell it's a little bit\ndifference with policing.\n\n341\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.300\nRemember with shaping we said we're\ngonna put it down here and whoops,\n\n342\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.750\nI don't know what we're gonna do there.\n\n343\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.300\nBut we're gonna put it down here and\nwe're gonna put it in a buffer and\n\n344\n00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.640\nthen when we get the chance we're gonna go\nahead and send that information, right?\n\n345\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.710\nWell policing doesn't do that all right?\n\n346\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.880\nPolicing says ninth bit.\n\n347\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.800\nYou're over what the policy says.\n\n348\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.830\nWe're going to take that and\nwe're going to completely discard it.\n\n349\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.280\nAll right so we take that ninth bit.\n\n350\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.270\nWe reject it and\ncompletely dump it all right?\n\n351\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.460\nSo it is still shaping\nbandwidth management.\n\n352\n00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.380\nBut two different things are happening.\n\n353\n00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.740\nRemember with the, again, shaping we're\nnot rejection information, we're not\n\n354\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:39.150\ndropping information, we're just buffering\nit and we'll send it when the line's free.\n\n355\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.880\nWith policing, on the other hand,\n\n356\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.050\nwe say if there's that ninth bit,\nwe're sending it right to the trash can.\n\n357\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; Electrical limbo, right,\n\n358\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.950\nwe're just gonna discarded it, right?\n\n359\n00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.050\nSo those are the two differences.\n\n360\n00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.380\nNow, there's another one too\ncalled reservation, reserving.\n\n361\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.780\nWe can say, well you know what,\n\n362\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.260\nI've got this one device that has\nhigh priority within the network.\n\n363\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.070\nAll right?\n\n364\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.040\nAnd if the bandwidth is there, then\nwe're not really worried about it, but\n\n365\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.090\nwhat we're going to do is gonna\nreserve a portion of the bandwidth for\n\n366\n00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.210\nthat high priority device, all right,\nthat's called a reservation.\n\n367\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.350\nNow, you can do an on-demand reservation,\n\n368\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.160\nwhich means when it needs it,\nit grabs it, all right?\n\n369\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160\nAnd when it doesn't need it,\nit releases it back,\n\n370\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.710\nthose resources back over to the network.\n\n371\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.320\nOr you could do more like\na static reservation that says,\n\n372\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.090\nI don't care if that device needs it or\nnot.\n\n373\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.260\nYou're gonna reserve that bandwidth for\nthat device.\n\n374\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.980\nNow, that could be good, it could be bad,\n\n375\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.110\nit depends on the priority of the device,\nright?\n\n376\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.960\nIt could be bad because what you're doing\nis you're taking that resource away and\n\n377\n00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.960\nyou're giving it to a device that might\nnot need it at the time where other\n\n378\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.420\ndevices might need it.\n\n379\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.060\nAll right, but you're guaranteeing that\ndevice has access to the bandwidth it\n\n380\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.920\nneeds when it needs it.\n\n381\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.930\nAll right, so two different ways.\n\n382\n00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.890\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.220\nLast thing that I wanna mention\nis what is known as, again,\n\n384\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.980\nit's more bandwidth manipulation,\nif you will.\n\n385\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.060\nAnd that's what's known as bandwidth\nthrottling and rate limiting, all right?\n\n386\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.200\nLet me show you here.\n\n387\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.720\nRate limiting,\nthink of it as an outbound, right?\n\n388\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.570\nWe've got a server that we're going\nto make some requests against.\n\n389\n00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.490\nWell we can set a threshold that says,\n\n390\n00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:23.100\nthis is the rate at which you can\nmake the requests, all right?\n\n391\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:28.040\nNow, throttling says,\nwhat happens if you hit that rate limit.\n\n392\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.705\nWell, we're gonna slow you down,\nall right.\n\n393\n00:22:32.705 --> 00:22:37.000\nNow, there is something to understand\nin rate limiting, what we're gonna do\n\n394\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.390\nis we could reject information, right,\nyou could throw and discard information.\n\n395\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.260\nThrottling just says hey,\nlet's just slow the amount of information\n\n396\n00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:50.030\nthat is going in or out of that\ninterface down to the acceptable level.\n\n397\n00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.740\nYou might see this is we're a big\nthing right now as of 2013, or 2013,\n\n398\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.541\nwell we've gone way back in time,\nI don't know where I'm at.\n\n399\n00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:59.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 2018 is what I meant to say,\n\n400\n00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.470\nwhere there's net neutrality.\n\n401\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:07.330\nRight now we know that ISPs\ndo throttle subscribers.\n\n402\n00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.350\nEspecially heavy use subscribers.\n\n403\n00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:13.480\nPeople that are always streaming\nNetflix or people that are doing things\n\n404\n00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.480\nthey shouldn't be like\nconstantly downloading and\n\n405\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.418\nuploading files through torrents, right.\n\n406\n00:23:17.418 --> 00:23:21.970\nWell your ISPs see that and what they\ncan is those heavy bandwidth users\n\n407\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.850\nactually slow or\nthrottle your communications down, right?\n\n408\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.390\nIt's kind of like in, you guys and\n\n409\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.150\ngals are coming from A+\nwhen we say CPU throttling.\n\n410\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.120\nWhat are we doing?\n\n411\n00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.120\nWe're reducing the amount of\npower that the CPU is using,\n\n412\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.470\nbasically reducing it's\nprocessing power as well, right?\n\n413\n00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.170\nNo different.\n\n414\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.610\nThrottling doesn't actually\ndiscard the information, right?\n\n415\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.930\nIt just says let's slow it\ndown to an acceptable level.\n\n416\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:54.160\nRate limiting defines how much information\ncan actually be sent at the time.\n\n417\n00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.850\nAnd we can combine them both.\n\n418\n00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.670\nWhen you hit the rate limit,\nsorry we're gonna slow you down.\n\n419\n00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.680\nMake sure there's a nice,\neven distribution.\n\n420\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.560\nSo these are a couple of the technologies\nthat you need to be aware of\n\n421\n00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.630\nwhen it comes to network performance.\n\n422\n00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.490\nWe kind of dived into the frames,\nwe kind of dived into the IP, or\n\n423\n00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.270\nthe packet there to kind of\nlook at those different values.\n\n424\n00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.850\nBe aware of those for\nthe net plus exam so that you'll do well.\n\n425\n00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.200\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou did a wonderful job as usual, Wes.\n\n426\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.500\n&gt;&gt; Network performance concepts and that's\ninside the accelerated Net Plus series.\n\n427\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.450\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode cuz Wes has done a great job\n\n428\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.420\nputting this all together for\nyou, and it will help you.\n\n429\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.390\nIt really will.\nAnd when you're in that course library,\n\n430\n00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.740\nthere's thousands of other videos that\nare there to help you go further.\n\n431\n00:24:33.740 -->

00:00:32.481\n[LAUGH] Welcome to ITProTV here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.384\nThanks Zach for\nhaving me back, that is right,\n\n15\n00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:38.877\nwe are going to be looking at\nwell the successor to IPv4.\n\n16\n00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:43.002\nIn other episodes,\nwe talk about Internet Protocol version 4,\n\n17\n00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.402\ndon't ask me what happened to IPv5.\n\n18\n00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.564\nI guess it got lost in the wash or\nsomething like that,\n\n19\n00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:48.976\nmaybe it didn't cut the mustard.\n\n20\n00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:54.558\nRight, but we're gonna talk about\nthe successor to IPv4 and that is IPv6.\n\n21\n00:00:54.558 --> 00:00:56.733\nAnd you might be asking yourself,\n\n22\n00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.740\nwhy do we need another IP protocol,\nwe already have one?\n\n23\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.513\nWell, there are some limitations to IPv4.\n\n24\n00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:08.093\nAnd one of the things that we have to\nunderstand is that when IP addressing\n\n25\n00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:09.144\nfirst came out,\n\n26\n00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:14.765\nthey really only allocated 4 bytes to\naddressing nodes within networks, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:16.870\nWell, there's 4 bytes or 32 bits,\n\n28\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.620\nthey have an exponential value that is\nrelatively limiting by today's standards.\n\n29\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.340\nNow in the days when going\nback to ARPANET, if you will.\n\n30\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.990\nIn the earlier days, this was plenty\nbig enough, the address space,\n\n31\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.514\nlike 4.294 billion and change.\n\n32\n00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:36.344\nRight, but they didn't expect, in any way,\nthey did not have the foresight to see\n\n33\n00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:39.527\nthat there was gonna be\nthe .com boom that would go on.\n\n34\n00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:44.090\nAnd just the growth that would happen\nacross what we know today as the Internet.\n\n35\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.750\nSo, they came out with the next\ngeneration IP protocol version 6.\n\n36\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.850\nLet's go ahead and dive in.\n\n37\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.131\nI've got a little diagram here\nto talk about this IPv6 address.\n\n38\n00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:02.086\nThis is actually four times\nthe size of an IPv4 address, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:05.960\nThis is what we call 128 bit address,\nright?\n\n40\n00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.725\nRemember, I said 2 to the power of 32 is,\nwell,\n\n41\n00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:10.770\n4.3 billion if you wanna round it up.\n\n42\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.369\nWell, this number is so large\nthe possibility is 2 to the power of 128,\n\n43\n00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:20.270\nit's actually 340 dizillion,\nit's 12 place values above a billion.\n\n44\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.595\nIt's an astronomically large address,\nright, so\n\n45\n00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:28.210\nI don't think we're gonna be running\nout of IP addresses any time soon.\n\n46\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.330\nRight, now the other thing to keep in mind\nis that it isn't written the same way in\n\n47\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.310\nIPv4 addresses.\n\n48\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.570\nIn fact, I got an example here,\nnotice that we have hexadecimal, right.\n\n49\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.407\nSo we have zero through nine, a through f,\nright, so it's a base 16 number.\n\n50\n00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:46.482\nAnd it is separated instead of by dots or\nperiods,\n\n51\n00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:51.060\nas you've probably seen inside of IPv4,\nseparated by colons, right.\n\n52\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.160\nSo where IPv4 is a dotted decimal\nnotation, right, this is what's known as\n\n53\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.780\nbasically a hexadecimal colon notation,\nor colon hexadecimal, if you will.\n\n54\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.460\nNow one of the great things to keep\nin mind too that's kinda cool that\n\n55\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.770\nthe engineers built in when\nthey developed IPv6 is that\n\n56\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.050\nyou could have multiple IPv6 addresses\non a single interface at one time.\n\n57\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.190\nAnd depending on where you\nneed to send information will\n\n58\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.750\ndictate which one of those IPv6 addresses\nthat you can use as IPv6 addresses.\n\n59\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.830\nNow notice that when we look\nat the 128 bit address,\n\n60\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.320\nit is essentially, when it's written in\nhexadecimal, and it's not in the binary.\n\n61\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.090\nThe binary, we don't have a screen\nlarge enough to fit all these\n\n62\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.430\nzeroes to where you\nguys could see it well.\n\n63\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.470\nIt's in the hexadecimal when it's written,\nit actually has eight total blocks, right?\n\n64\n00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.770\nNow that's a pretty big\nnumber to work with.\n\n65\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.771\nSo they did put techniques in it that\nwould allow you to do abbreviations to\n\n66\n00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.770\nthis address to make it a little bit more,\nI don't wanna say simplistic,\n\n67\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.543\nif you will but\n\n68\n00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:59.894\na little bit more feasible to work with\ncuz really nothing simplistic about it.\n\n69\n00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:02.810\nAnd if we look at it, let's look at\nsome of the abbreviations, right?\n\n70\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.340\nNotice that this is the non-abbreviated\naddress here, right?\n\n71\n00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.950\nWell, I also want you to notice that,\nwe have one, two, three, four, five, six,\n\n72\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.650\nseven and eight of those individual\nblocks, again separated by colons.\n\n73\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.000\nBut notice that we also have\nsome zeros in here, right?\n\n74\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.820\nAnd more importantly, I want you to\nnotice that we have leading zeros.\n\n75\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.716\nRight, we have three leading zeros here,\nthree leading zeros here,\n\n76\n00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:31.093\nand again three here and then two leading\nzeros, a single leading zero there.\n\n77\n00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:34.860\nOne of the first things you can do is\njust abbreviate by taking out leading\n\n78\n00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.510\nzeros, right?\n\n79\n00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.210\nSo if you'll notice, this first\n\n80\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.890\nabbreviation of our IPv6 address is\nactually valid, this is the same address.\n\n81\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.640\nNotice we've removed all\nof those leading zeroes.\n\n82\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.884\nAnd it might be easier to see,\nnotice the :0054:08:DE,\n\n83\n00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:55.921\nright, well notice we just have a 54 and\nan 8DE.\n\n84\n00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:59.350\nI've removed or\nabbreviated those leading zeroes.\n\n85\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.992\nNow notice also, with the leading zeros,\nafter these continuous blocks of zeros\n\n86\n00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:06.398\nhave been removed too, and they've\nbeen replaced with just a single zero.\n\n87\n00:05:06.398 --> 00:05:10.990\nRight, so that's the first way that\nyou're gonna abbreviate the IPv6 address.\n\n88\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.920\nNow, you can go even farther than that.\n\n89\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.420\nNotice that we have\ncontinuous blocks of zeros?\n\n90\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:23.150\nYou can actually remove those zeros, and\nthen replace them with a double colon.\n\n91\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.820\nSo believe it or not,\nthis address is actually the same as well.\n\n92\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.400\nIf we look, all three of these\naddresses are exactly the same,\n\n93\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.970\nnotice there's a double colon there.\n\n94\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.130\nNow be careful, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.120\nOn the exam, I want you to realize\nthat the double colon and, really for\n\n96\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.150\njust IPv6 addressing could only appear\nat one place inside of the IPv6 address.\n\n97\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.150\nWhy is that?\n\n98\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.570\nBecause your operating systems,\nyour routers if you will,\n\n99\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.530\nright, your connectivity devices\nknow what that double colon means.\n\n100\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.880\nIt means, when I get to that double colon,\nI've got to fill in some zeros there.\n\n101\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.800\nI know that there\nare zeros that are missing.\n\n102\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.440\nAnd it'll say okay, I notice I have one,\ntwo, three, four, five blocks.\n\n103\n00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.720\nWell that means, IPv6 is an eight-block\naddress, I'm missing three blocks,\n\n104\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.380\nright, and\nit will fill those blocks back in.\n\n105\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.500\nSo that's important in understanding\nthe structure of the IPv6 address.\n\n106\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.690\nNow just like IPv4,\n\n107\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.031\nwe have different portions of the address\nthat are used for different things.\n\n108\n00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:26.295\nRight, in IPv4, we say it's comprised\nkind of like a street address,\n\n109\n00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:28.556\nis a street name and a house ID.\n\n110\n00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:33.272\nThe street name would be what we call\nan IPv4, would be akin to the network ID,\n\n111\n00:06:33.272 --> 00:06:33.990\nall right.\n\n112\n00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.442\nAnd then uniquely identifying node on\nthe network would the node identifier,\n\n113\n00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:40.110\nright, the host ID.\n\n114\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.432\nWell guess what, you also have\nthat same thing inside of IPv6.\n\n115\n00:06:44.432 --> 00:06:49.520\nAnd this dividing line could be\nmoved based on a prefix, all right.\n\n116\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.939\nBecause when an IPv6 address is\napplied at that 128 bit level,\n\n117\n00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:02.830\nwhat you will see behind it,\nis typically slash notation, all right.\n\n118\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:08.290\nWhen we say slash notation,\nslash notation defines the bits within\n\n119\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:14.144\nthe IPv6 address that are reserved for\nwhat's known as the network ID.\n\n120\n00:07:14.144 --> 00:07:18.643\nYou have a network ID as well, that's 64\nbits, and it can change just like in CIDR,\n\n121\n00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:22.180\nright, Classless Inter-Domain Routing,\nCIDR notation.\n\n122\n00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.420\nWe could move those bits, and we can\ndefine which portion is the network ID.\n\n123\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.900\nWell, if I switch this over to a /48,\nit isn't gonna be divided,\n\n124\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.180\nnice clean, right down the middle,\n64-64, for a total of 128.\n\n125\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.530\nSo that can be moved, but understand,\n\n126\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.570\na portion of your IPv6\naddress is a network ID.\n\n127\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.526\nAnd a portion of it is what\nis known as the interface ID.\n\n128\n00:07:48.526 --> 00:07:53.361\nAll right, so I did mention that there are\ndifferent types of IPv6 addresses when we\n\n129\n00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.587\nfirst started out and\n\n130\n00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:59.285\nI said that a network adapter could have\nmultiple IPV6 addresses, we need to kind\n\n131\n00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:03.600\nof talk about what are known as the\naddress types that you have, all right?\n\n132\n00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.060\nAnd you have three different kinds.\n\n133\n00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.760\nNow your first thought, if you're coming\nfrom IPV4 is you're gonna say I know what\n\n134\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.380\nthose three kinds are, Wes, it is going to\nbe a Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast.\n\n135\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.372\nWrong, all right?\n\n136\n00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:17.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that IPv6 is a little\n\n137\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.720\nbit more efficient at is it completely\neliminates broadcast communications.\n\n138\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.440\nWe don't do broadcast\ncommunications anymore.\n\n139\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.970\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n140\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.900\nYou have still three,\nbut broadcast your out.\n\n141\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.570\nYou gotta sit the bench on this one.\n\n142\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.200\nYour no longer needed, right?\n\n143\n00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.450\nBecause broadcast communications they\nserved their purpose in IPv4, but\n\n144\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.380\nthey can waste the valuable\nresources in our bandwidth, right?\n\n145\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.970\nSo what's typically done with broadcast\nis gonna be done with a multicast\n\n146\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:45.650\ncommunication.\n\n147\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.630\nNow the concepts are just the same.\n\n148\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.950\nA unicast, IPv6 address,\nis a one to one communication.\n\n149\n00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:57.290\nA multicast, just like in IPv4,\nit is a one to a specific group, right?\n\n150\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.350\nWe talked about the pay-per-view event,\nright?\n\n151\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.510\nIf you purchase the UFC fight,\n\n152\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.150\nif you purchase that boxing\nfight well guess what?\n\n153\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.050\nIt comes to your cable,\nyour top set box, right?\n\n154\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.520\nBut if you didn't purchase it, it doesn't.\n\n155\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.970\nYou're not a part of\nthe pay-per-view event, and\n\n156\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.090\nyou're not part of the group, right?\n\n157\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.430\nWell multicast is the same way.\n\n158\n00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.810\nIt is one to many, or\none to a group if you will.\n\n159\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.540\nNow broadcast being eliminated,\nwe also have what's known as a Anycast,\n\n160\n00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.770\nIPv6 uses something known as\na Anycast which is I1 to the best.\n\n161\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.510\nAll right one the ways that I like to\nsay is if you think about DNS, right,\n\n162\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.580\nin DNS we have thirteen IP addresses,\nthirteen authorities that map to\n\n163\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.030\nthe servers, but there's hundreds\nof route hidden servers, right?\n\n164\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.920\nAnd if I need to contact, or a DNS server\nneeds to contact a route hidden server,\n\n165\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.280\nthere's no reason for,\nlet's say if we're here in the states, for\n\n166\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.350\nit to contact one all the way around\nthe world, let's say, in China.\n\n167\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.960\nSo the router can say I see the best path\n\n168\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.230\nto send this information to\nget you your request back.\n\n169\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.560\nThat's in Anycast, one to the best.\n\n170\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.920\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nmove down the list here a little bit.\n\n171\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.430\nNext thing I want to talk about\nis what's know as the scope.\n\n172\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:10.060\nAll right, what we mean by IPv6 Scopes\nare where are we sending this information?\n\n173\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.990\nIs it local?\n\n174\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.140\nIs it across the internet?\n\n175\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.290\nIs it within our networks?\n\n176\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.000\nRight?\n\n177\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.668\nAnd we have what are known as, Global\naddresses, we have what are known as,\n\n178\n00:10:18.668 --> 00:10:23.300\nUnique-local addresses, so\nULA's as they call them, and\n\n179\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.270\nwe have what's known as, Link-local.\n\n180\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.030\nI want you to think of your global\naddresses as kind of like your public IPv4\n\n181\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.190\naddresses.\n\n182\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.690\nThey call them global for a reason.\n\n183\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.700\nThey are globally routable,\nroutable around the world, right?\n\n184\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.606\nSo hence the name, and\n\n185\n00:10:36.606 --> 00:10:39.533\nit makes it a little bit easier if you\ncan think about it that way, right?\n\n186\n00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:42.680\nWe said public IP address.\n\n187\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.850\nWell, unless you know what we mean by\npublic, we're routing across the Internet,\n\n188\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.950\nit might not make sense.\n\n189\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.770\nBut if you can think about global address,\n\n190\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.410\nit means globally we could send that\ninformation around the world, right?\n\n191\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.370\nKinda like your public IPv4 addresses.\n\n192\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.472\nNow, we also have unique\nlocal-addresses and\n\n193\n00:10:58.472 --> 00:11:04.470\nunique local-addresses are kind of\nakin to a private ipb4 address.\n\n194\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.630\nWhen I need to send\ninformation inside my network,\n\n195\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.720\nI'm not gonna use the unique\nlocal address and\n\n196\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.100\nI can keep that information within\ninside of our companies network.\n\n197\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.300\nNow if we happen to be on the same subnet\nsharing the same kinda communication\n\n198\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.030\nlink within that same local network and\nwe need to send traffic.\n\n199\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.589\nWe can use what's known as the Link-local.\n\n200\n00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:32.600\nThe Link-local address is when we have\ncomputers that are on that same subnet,\n\n201\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.010\nthey can communicate.\n\n202\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.730\nAnd rather than send it to\na router that has to route it\n\n203\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.000\neven within our networks across routers\nwhich would be the unique-local.\n\n204\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.170\nThere's no reason to send it\nout to the internet, right?\n\n205\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.480\nAnd so we don't use it global,\nwe can just use the link-local address and\n\n206\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.420\nwhen we use link-local addresses,\nit's kind of interesting,\n\n207\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.235\nthere's a couple of things,\ncouple of technology that are used.\n\n208\n00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:56.045\nAnd one is known as a router\nadvertisement message.\n\n209\n00:11:56.045 --> 00:12:01.075\nAnd a router advertisement message\nessentially allows all nodes on a link\n\n210\n00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:03.775\nto discover the routers\nconnected to that same link.\n\n211\n00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:08.725\nAnd they use this, interestingly enough,\nwith ICMP version six,\n\n212\n00:12:08.725 --> 00:12:14.750\nthe internet control message protocol,\nbut version six, not version four, right?\n\n213\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.900\nNow at startup, all right,\nwhat happens is the systems\n\n214\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.610\nactually send a router\nsolicitation message, if you will,\n\n215\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:29.220\nto what's known as that link local\nmulticast address to discover.\n\n216\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.580\nNow there's also what's known as\na neighbor discovery technology, and\n\n217\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.560\nthat allows the nodes, if you will,\n\n218\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.374\nto determine the link layer Link-local,\nright?\n\n219\n00:12:39.374 --> 00:12:43.750\nThe link-layer address, if you will,\n\n220\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.110\nof it's nearest neighbors\nthat are on that same link.\n\n221\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.440\nIt also allows a node to verify that,\nthat neighbor is actually reachable and\n\n222\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.010\nit also does something pretty\ncool which is DAD and.\n\n223\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.780\nWhat we mean by DADis not your father but\n\n224\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.470\nwhat we're talking about is that it can\nuse those neighbor solicitation methods\n\n225\n00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.060\nin order to ensure that there\nisn't an address duplication.\n\n226\n00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.010\nThat's what's known, DAD is what's known\nas duplicate address detection, right?\n\n227\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.470\nKind of like how we talk about a PIPA or\nif there's an IP address conflict, right?\n\n228\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:21.610\nWhen I assign an IP address statically or\nI guess statically yeah it doesn't matter.\n\n229\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.040\nIf you do it statically or\ndynamically, right?\n\n230\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.440\nYour nodes in IPv4 will send out\nan arch message and they'll say hey,\n\n231\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.720\nthis is my IP address and\nit's gonna map to this MAC address, right?\n\n232\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.270\nAnd then it listens if another computer\nalready has that IP address then it\n\n233\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.660\nresponds back and\nit says with a broadcast,\n\n234\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.900\nwhoa wait a second network that's\ntrying to steal my IP address.\n\n235\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.490\nthat's already my IP address\nassigned to this MAC address, right?\n\n236\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:53.080\nSo that's kinda how the duplicate\naddress detection's done in IPv4, right?\n\n237\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.880\nWell, I can actually do this through\nneighbor discovery on the link local,\n\n238\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.030\nagain, multicast communications\neliminating that broadcast communication.\n\n239\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.250\nSo it does a lot more efficiently.\n\n240\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:10.910\nNow one of the things I want you\nalso to be able to know is that,\n\n241\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:16.010\nthere are different transitioning\ntechnologies because of the Internet\n\n242\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:21.180\nstill is largely IPv4 even though more and\nmore support for IPv6 daily.\n\n243\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.330\nMonth to month, year to year, all right?\n\n244\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.930\nThere's still a lot of\nthe Internet out there, and\n\n245\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.630\na lot of our internal\nnetworks that use IPv4.\n\n246\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.810\nIPv4 and IPv6,\nthey aren't compatible, right?\n\n247\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.230\nOne's a 32-bit address space using\nthings like broadcast communications.\n\n248\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:41.360\nIPv6 is 128 bits using not\nutilizing broadcast communication.\n\n249\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.400\nThey aren't compatible with one another.\n\n250\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.520\nSo there might be a situation in which\nyou need to take IPv6 information and\n\n251\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.470\nyou need to encapsulate it so that you\ncan send it across an IPv4 network.\n\n252\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.310\nAnd there's a couple of transitional or\n\n253\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.170\ntranslational technologies that\nI want you to be aware of.\n\n254\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.720\nThe three that I want you to be aware\nof are what is known as 6 to 4, and\n\n255\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.960\nit's just like it sounds.\n\n256\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:09.580\nIt's 6 to, if you're in English here,\n624, IPv6 over 4, right?\n\n257\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.735\nThe other thing is something\nknown as ice attack.\n\n258\n00:15:13.735 --> 00:15:19.215\nNow ISATAP is the Intra-site\nAutomatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol.\n\n259\n00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:21.495\nAnd what that does is the same thing.\n\n260\n00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:24.415\nIt takes your IPv6 information and\nencapsulates it and\n\n261\n00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:27.815\nallows you to send it\nacross an IPv4 network.\n\n262\n00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:30.095\nWell, here's another one, Teredo.\n\n263\n00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.965\nNow Teredo is a last ditch effort and\nit's really complex.\n\n264\n00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.280\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.050\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those things that Microsoft\n\n266\n00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.690\nadopted but even Microsoft says, hey this\nis really just, use anything else but\n\n267\n00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.060\nthis but at least its out there.\n\n268\n00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Why would I use one over the other.\n\n269\n00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.915\nLet me show you here,\nI got a little diagram.\n\n270\n00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:55.327\nISATAP is when you need to send IPv6\ninformation over an IPv4 network\n\n271\n00:15:55.327 --> 00:16:01.100\nWithin your local area network,\nwithin your LAN, all right?\n\n272\n00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.957\nIf you're doing 6to4, this is where you\nuse something like a dual stack router.\n\n273\n00:16:06.957 --> 00:16:10.524\nWhich, dual-stack means it\noperates with IPv4 and IPv6,\n\n274\n00:16:10.524 --> 00:16:12.930\nhence the term dual stack, right?\n\n275\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:18.230\nAnd what it does is it receives the IPv4\ninformation, then it encapsulates it,\n\n276\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.840\nor excuse me,\nreceives the IPv6 information,\n\n277\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.786\nencapsulates it in IPv4 and\nsends it across the Internet.\n\n278\n00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:29.017\nSo all right,\nISATAP is on your internal networks.\n\n279\n00:16:29.017 --> 00:16:32.569\nWhen you need to route\ntraffic across the Internet,\n\n280\n00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:36.480\nIPv6 over an IPv4 network,\nyou're gonna use 6to4.\n\n281\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.310\nThe last one that I\ntalked about was Teredo.\n\n282\n00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.330\nHoly Teredo, Batman.\n\n283\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.440\n&gt;&gt; Holy Teredo.\n&gt;&gt; This is the one that we,\n\n284\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.139\nthis is the one when we have IPv6\ninformation that we need to send over\n\n285\n00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:52.824\nan IPV4 network when it's behind a network\naddress translation device, right?\n\n286\n00:16:52.824 --> 00:16:54.990\nSo that's the reason you would use Teredo.\n\n287\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.634\nYou'd use Teredo if you\nhave IPv6 information, and\n\n288\n00:16:57.634 --> 00:17:00.810\nyou're sitting behind a network\naddress translation device,\n\n289\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.467\nand you need to send it out\nover the Internet, right?\n\n290\n00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:08.563\nIf you're not behind network address\ntranslation device, then you use 6to4.\n\n291\n00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:15.960\nAll right, so, how do we identify these\ndifferent types of addresses, all right?\n\n292\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.600\nWell, they have what are known\nas routing prefixes.\n\n293\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.490\nSo something else I want you to be\nable to understand is what is known\n\n294\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.200\nas the routing prefixes.\n\n295\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.250\nNow routing prefixes define essentially\n\n296\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:36.080\nwhat the address looks like and the\ndifferent types of addresses, all right?\n\n297\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.120\nI got a little diagram, now this really\nisn't called out on the exam, but\n\n298\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.160\nyou do wanna know this because they\nwant you to know about IPv6 in general.\n\n299\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.089\nWe've got a few different types,\nall right?\n\n300\n00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:51.934\nWhen you look at a unique local address,\n\n301\n00:17:51.934 --> 00:17:56.345\nthat first block starts with an FC00:, and\n\n302\n00:17:56.345 --> 00:18:01.775\nI could probably,\nit looks like it missed a colon there,\n\n303\n00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:05.280\nwith a prefix of /7, all right?\n\n304\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.735\nMulticast information,\nmulticast communications\n\n305\n00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:16.540\ngo over FF00, and again, with a /8 prefix.\n\n306\n00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.388\nYour Teredo addresses are 2001.\n\n307\n00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:22.658\nThat very first block, if you will,\nis going to be 2001, and\n\n308\n00:18:22.658 --> 00:18:25.854\nthen your 6to4 are your 2002, all right?\n\n309\n00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:32.072\nNow what are these up here, all right,\nwhat are these here, all right?\n\n310\n00:18:32.072 --> 00:18:35.745\nWell, when you have a computer, all right,\n\n311\n00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:41.600\ncomputers don't understand how\nto route information, all right?\n\n312\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.170\nAnd let me go ahead and\nswitch over to my Windows 10 machine and\n\n313\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.660\npull up its routing table\nbecause it's kinda interesting.\n\n314\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.449\nI'm telling you they don't\nknow how to route information,\n\n315\n00:18:49.449 --> 00:18:51.485\nbut they're gonna look at a routing table?\n\n316\n00:18:51.485 --> 00:18:52.489\nWhat does that mean?\n\n317\n00:18:52.489 --> 00:18:53.788\n[LAUGH] Let me show you what I mean.\n\n318\n00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:56.160\nHopefully, we'll clear\nthis up a little bit.\n\n319\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.680\nSee, a computer is aware of the network\nthat it's connected to, all right?\n\n320\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:09.260\nSome of the default routes as well\nas the default gateway, all right?\n\n321\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.130\nAnd let me go ahead, let's,\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n322\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.470\nbring up a command prompt here.\n\n323\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.141\nAll right, so\nif I clear the screen up here,\n\n324\n00:19:17.141 --> 00:19:22.287\ngive us a little more real estate and do a\nroute print, oops, how about route print?\n\n325\n00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.620\nYou gotta type the route print there.\n\n326\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.450\nThere we go, this is the routing table\nwithin my Windows machine, right?\n\n327\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.036\nAnd when we look at the routes\nthat are in the routing table,\n\n328\n00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:33.764\nyou're gonna notice something here.\n\n329\n00:19:33.764 --> 00:19:37.162\nNotice this 10.10.0.0?\n\n330\n00:19:37.162 --> 00:19:42.008\nThat's the network ID, and\nthat's how this computer knows\n\n331\n00:19:42.008 --> 00:19:46.690\nof the network that it's connected to,\nall right?\n\n332\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:52.230\nAnd when it needs to determine, do I send\nthis information to the local network,\n\n333\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.410\nor do I send it to my default gateway,\nthe router,\n\n334\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.150\nthat can get the communication off of that\nlocal network, It's gonna do something.\n\n335\n00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:04.200\nIt's gonna look at the destination\ninformation in the IP header, right,\n\n336\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.750\nwherever it's sending it to.\n\n337\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.760\nAnd then what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna take that IP address and\n\n338\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.990\nit's gonna apply its subnet mask to\ndetermine what the network ID is.\n\n339\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.740\nNow if that network ID matches\nthis route right here,\n\n340\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.180\nthis network, then it says,\nI'm on the local network.\n\n341\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.590\nI don't need to send this to the router,\nright?\n\n342\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.890\nSo let me go ahead and i'll look\nat the destination IP address, and\n\n343\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.930\nlet me do an ARP request.\n\n344\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.310\nSay who out there has this IP address, and\nit'll broadcast that information right?\n\n345\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.197\nWhen it broadcasts that information,\n\n346\n00:20:34.197 --> 00:20:38.310\nthe computer that has that IP address\non that local network will respond.\n\n347\n00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.700\nSo these are, and this one right\nhere happens to be the route or\n\n348\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.860\nthe IP address of this computer.\n\n349\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.690\nThis happens to be the broadcast address,\nright?\n\n350\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.620\nNotice that it's also aware of the\nloopback interface in the loopback network\n\n351\n00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.390\nas well as APIPA, right?\n\n352\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.420\nWell, it's also aware of the multicast\naddresses, like right here\n\n353\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.730\nare the multicast networks, right,\nthat we talk about in other episode.\n\n354\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.970\nWell, and we're talking about\nmulticast in this episode.\n\n355\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.730\nThese are IPv4 addresses, all right?\n\n356\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.120\nHowever, what I'm gonna do is I'm going\nto filter this route print command.\n\n357\n00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.000\nAnd this time,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna say,\n\n358\n00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.902\nleave the four information out.\n\n359\n00:21:14.902 --> 00:21:15.630\nYou know what?\n\n360\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.345\nAnd I said, no, keep the four information.\n\n361\n00:21:17.345 --> 00:21:21.095\n[LAUGH] Let's take the four\ninformation and let's go ahead and\n\n362\n00:21:21.095 --> 00:21:24.060\nlook at the routing table for\nIPv6, all right?\n\n363\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.750\nWhat is this right here, all right?\n\n364\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.410\nWhen we look at this ::1, all right,\n\n365\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:35.370\nwhat this is is what's known\nas the loopback address.\n\n366\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:40.352\nAnd with the loopback address,\nit's just like in IPv4 here,\n\n367\n00:21:40.352 --> 00:21:44.210\nbut they made it a little\nbit easier to remember.\n\n368\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.708\nInstead of the 127.0.0.1,\nwhat we have here is they said, okay,\n\n369\n00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:53.347\nwell, you know what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna make it all zeros except for\n\n370\n00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:54.777\nthe last bit position.\n\n371\n00:21:54.777 --> 00:21:59.020\nWe'll put a one and\nwe'll mask it out, all 128 bits.\n\n372\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.690\nSo I want you to know that\na loopback address in IPv6 could be\n\n373\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.150\neight blocks of four contiguous zeros.\n\n374\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.478\nIt could be just,\nremember if we truncate the leading zeros,\n\n375\n00:22:12.478 --> 00:22:15.240\nit could be eight zeros\nseparated by colons.\n\n376\n00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:22.020\nOr, since it's all contiguous zeros,\ncolon colon one, with a forward slash 128.\n\n377\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.620\nThe loopback address is the same thing.\n\n378\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.650\nFor instance, when we use ping, right,\n\n379\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.060\nwe can ping the loopback address\nto test the software, right?\n\n380\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.325\nSo if I ping the IPv4 address,\nI could say yep,\n\n381\n00:22:36.325 --> 00:22:39.410\nTCP/IP is working in\nthis operating system.\n\n382\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:46.460\nBut we can also do, we can ping,\nif we want, we can do :: and we can do 1.\n\n383\n00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.320\nAnd notice we're getting replies back,\nright?\n\n384\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.400\nSo that's the IPv6 loopback address.\n\n385\n00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.160\nNow if I go ahead and clear this out and\n\n386\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.840\nwe rerun my our route print command and\ndo V6 here.\n\n387\n00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.160\nNotice that I told you we had\nsome other address types, right?\n\n388\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.178\nWell your fe80,\nthat's your link local address.\n\n389\n00:23:06.178 --> 00:23:10.617\nNotice the prefix there that divides it\nright down the middle, says half of that\n\n390\n00:23:10.617 --> 00:23:14.741\nis the network ID, the other half of\nthat is the interface ID, all right?\n\n391\n00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:18.395\nAnd this is actually my current,\nin the routing table,\n\n392\n00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:22.749\njust like an IPv4 address where I\nsaid this is your IPv4 address,\n\n393\n00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:26.450\nthat is actually my current\nlink local address.\n\n394\n00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.960\nNow we also have multicast addresses,\nright?\n\n395\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:34.640\nJust like up here back in IPv4,\nhere is our multicast address, right?\n\n396\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.990\nSo you can kinda see some of those routing\nprefixes that we were talking about.\n\n397\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.620\nSo I want you to remember those for\nthe exam.\n\n398\n00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.340\nWhat is this one right here?\n\n399\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.030\nWell, that one right there is actually\nwhat's known as the default route.\n\n400\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.854\nRemember that I told you when a computer\nneeds to send information off of its local\n\n401\n00:23:50.854 --> 00:23:51.368\nnetwork?\n\n402\n00:23:51.368 --> 00:23:54.336\nWell, it's gonna do that process\nwhere it applies its subnet mask, and\n\n403\n00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:57.417\nif it determines that it's local,\nit doesn't need the default gateway.\n\n404\n00:23:57.417 --> 00:24:01.701\nBut if it applies that subnet mask And the\nnetwork IDs don't match its network ID,\n\n405\n00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:02.693\nthen it says,\n\n406\n00:24:02.693 --> 00:24:07.170\nI gotta send that to somebody who can get\nthat information where it needs to go.\n\n407\n00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:12.430\nAnd it uses all 0s in IPv4, 0.0.0,\nit's called the default route.\n\n408\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.440\nMeans I don't know where it's going to go,\nthat's where I'm gonna send it.\n\n409\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.193\nWell, guess what?\n\n410\n00:24:18.193 --> 00:24:23.431\nAll 0's, inside [LAUGH] of IPv6::.\n\n411\n00:24:23.431 --> 00:24:24.360\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n412\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.890\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know if this computer\nactually has a default gateway.\n\n413\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:34.000\nCuz if you ever get on the exam and they\nask you, is there a default gateway here?\n\n414\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.010\nAnd you don't see all 0's,\nlike this right here.\n\n415\n00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.330\nAnd then chances are you\ndon't have a default gateway.\n\n416\n00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.600\nAnd I don't see a gateway for\nsix, so I probably.\n\n417\n00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.960\nI know what it is,\nI got it dynamically assigned and\n\n418\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.930\nit's not assigning that default gateway.\n\n419\n00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.760\nI would have to statically map that.\n\n420\n00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:58.980\nWhich brings me to one of the last things\nthat we gotta talk about, all right.\n\n421\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.580\nOne of the things than\nan IPv6 network adapter,\n\n422\n00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.990\na computer that is assigned\nan IPv6 address can do.\n\n423\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:13.170\nThey can be statically signed, which means\nyou can configure them yourself manually,\n\n424\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.040\nwhich can be a pain but\nthere are reasons to do that.\n\n425\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.830\nBut they also said, you know what.\n\n426\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.700\nLet's go ahead and develop a way in which\n\n427\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.310\nwe can dynamically allow\nthe operating system,\n\n428\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.810\nthe device to go ahead and\njust assign its own interface ID.\n\n429\n00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.150\nAnd that's what's known as EUI64.\n\n430\n00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.790\nThe Extended User Interface 64.\n\n431\n00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:43.760\nAnd what this does is it takes,\nessentially, the MAC address, right?\n\n432\n00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.420\nThat layer two address, and\nthey've reserved a few special bits.\n\n433\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.550\nRemember our Mac address is a 48\nbit layer two address, right?\n\n434\n00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.790\nSix bytes long, half of the bytes,\n\n435\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:26:00.330\nthe first three bytes are the vendor ID or\nthe organizationally unique identifier.\n\n436\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.600\nThe last bytes identify\nuniquely the network adapter\n\n437\n00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.350\nwithin that manufacturer, right?\n\n438\n00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.610\nThose are the 48 bits.\n\n439\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.690\nWell they said,\nwe already got the 48 bits.\n\n440\n00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:15.330\nYou know what, if we just go ahead and\nwe reserve a special set of bits.\n\n441\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.780\nMore importantly, FF, FE,\nand we say you know what,\n\n442\n00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.150\nif we divide the OUI in half, or\ndivide the mac address in half.\n\n443\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.830\nAnd we've got the OUI, and we've got\nthe NIC, or the network interface card,\n\n444\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:33.930\nthe unique identifier for that and\nwe put these 16 bits right in the middle,\n\n445\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.630\nwell, what 16 plus 48, 64.\n\n446\n00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:44.260\nThat'll be a way that the computer itself\ncan assign it's own network interface ID.\n\n447\n00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:49.088\nWhich means we don't have to assign it,\nit can do this for us.\n\n448\n00:26:49.088 --> 00:26:55.415\nAnd that ends up becoming what's\nknown as your network an EUI64 or\n\n449\n00:26:55.415 --> 00:27:01.410\na dynamically assigned network\ninterface portion of address.\n\n450\n00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.730\nNot network ID, the interface\nID becomes the last 64 bits and\n\n451\n00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.110\nit's a way that, essentially\nthe operating system can do this.\n\n452\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.700\nNow, so, one of the things that\nwe talk about in other episodes,\n\n453\n00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.155\nwe talk about DCPV6.\n\n454\n00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:18.480\nDHCPV6 can be stateful,\nit can be stateless right.\n\n455\n00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.695\nAnd what I mean by that, if it's stateful,\nit means you don't want to allow\n\n456\n00:27:23.695 --> 00:27:28.750\nEUI64 to work, you want to manually\nconfigure every single IPV6 address.\n\n457\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.990\nIn your network,\n\n458\n00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:34.770\nwhich means allow the DHCP server to hand\nout a pool of IPv6 addresses, right?\n\n459\n00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.190\nOr you can go with what's\nknown as stateful.\n\n460\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.310\nStateful means full of work.\n\n461\n00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.750\nIt means you're gonna\nconfigure it manually.\n\n462\n00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.638\nOr you can do stateless which says,\nyou know what?\n\n463\n00:27:45.638 --> 00:27:50.110\nLet's let EUI64, let's let\nthe operating systems go ahead figure\n\n464\n00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:54.800\nout what their IPv6\naddress is gonna be and\n\n465\n00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.640\nwhat we'll do is we'll just use our\nDHCPv6 server to hand out the options,\n\n466\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.740\nthe additional host\nconfigurations that we wanna do.\n\n467\n00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.690\nAnd that's where UI64 comes in, it gets.\n\n468\n00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:10.280\nIt allows the computer to\nassign basically a layer 3\n\n469\n00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.190\nIPv6 address using that data-link layer or\nlayer 2 MAC address.\n\n470\n00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:18.130\nThese are some of

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.312\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.312 --> 00:00:06.435\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.122\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:11.917\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:13.812\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for choosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:16.149\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.053\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with accelerated Network+,\n\n8\n00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.829\nAuthentication Access Control,\nthat is the title of this episode and\n\n9\n00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.230\nWes Bryan is here to take as through it.\n\n10\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.220\nWes, good to see you sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you too, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.356\nYep that's right we are gonna\nbe looking at authentication and\n\n13\n00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:32.952\naccess control just like Zach said.\n\n14\n00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:37.396\nBut we'll also be looking at some other\nconcepts behind that which kinda blend\n\n15\n00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:41.977\nthe access control into something known\nas authentication, authorization and\n\n16\n00:00:41.977 --> 00:00:46.780\naccounting, so that's where we're\ngonna be looking at in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.037\nAll right, so let's go ahead and just\ndefine real quick what authentication is.\n\n18\n00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:54.180\nAuthentication is really a validation\nof a set of credentials.\n\n19\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.610\nKeep in mind that one thing that we try\nto stress is that identification and\n\n20\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.790\nauthentication really\naren't the same thing.\n\n21\n00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.670\nEven though a lot of times they're\nconsidered to be, they're close,\n\n22\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.530\nbut they're not the same thing.\n\n23\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.830\nRemember, authentication is\nvalidating a set of credentials, but\n\n24\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.830\nit doesn't verify that the person\nthat is using those credentials\n\n25\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.380\nis the one that should, is authorized\nto use those credentials, right?\n\n26\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.960\nI don't know if I have it on me,\nhere, but for\n\n27\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.480\ninstance, I've got my little\nsecurity access card, right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.630\nMy little smart card here, and\nI can then touch this to the door and\n\n29\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.250\nI get into the areas that I have\nauthorization to be at, right?\n\n30\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.714\nWhat would stop if I left this on\nthe counter from Zach picking it up and\n\n31\n00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:36.269\nusing it?\n\n32\n00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:39.301\nNow, Zach's not malicious and I'm not\na malicious intent in his heart but\n\n33\n00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.990\nwhat I mean-\n&gt;&gt; I do follow him around a lot,\n\n34\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.280\nso I could do that.\n\n35\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.761\n&gt;&gt; Right, but there's nothing\nreally saying that you know well,\n\n36\n00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:50.150\nZach couldn't pick this up and that he\ncould authenticate with my card, right?\n\n37\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.840\nSo authentication, again, is just\na validation of a set of credentials.\n\n38\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.164\nIdentification is actually the precursor\nto authorization or, I'm sorry,\n\n39\n00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:58.217\nauthentication.\n\n40\n00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.412\nAnd what I mean by that is, I had to,\n\n41\n00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:04.546\nprove I was who I said I was during\nthe onboarding process, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:07.680\nRemember onboarding, offboarding,\nonboarding, you're being hired and\n\n43\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.210\nyou go through a process, and\nI have to present my drivers license,\n\n44\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.500\nSocial Security card or\npassport if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.960\nI have to identify myself.\n\n46\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.790\nI have to prove I am who I say I am,\nand then I get my credentials.\n\n47\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.309\nSo again, just keep in mind that\nthey are two separate things.\n\n48\n00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.610\nNow, when it comes to authentication,\n\n49\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.650\nthere are a few different what\nthey call authentication factors.\n\n50\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.560\nThere's ways that you can validate\nyour credentials, all right.\n\n51\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.400\nI've got a little list here.\n\n52\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.260\nLet's talk about the list\nthat we have here.\n\n53\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.690\nThe three common ones\nthat have been around for\n\n54\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.280\na very long time are something you know,\nsomething you have or something you are.\n\n55\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.270\nNow those ones again,\nlet's talk about each one individually.\n\n56\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.250\nAll right,\nnow the first one is something you know.\n\n57\n00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.850\nWhen you talk about something you know,\nI want you to think of a username and\n\n58\n00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.470\npassword.\n\n59\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.070\nI want you to think of a PIN,\npersonal identification number.\n\n60\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.620\nI want you to think of\na security question, right?\n\n61\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.810\nYou've probably gone to the bank before or\nmaybe logged into your bank account and\n\n62\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.280\nyou have to know your password.\n\n63\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.630\nYou have to know a security question.\n\n64\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.950\nThese are things that you can remember,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.640\nThat's something you know.\n\n66\n00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.110\nThe next one we have on the list here\nis something you have, all right.\n\n67\n00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.200\nWell what is something you have?\n\n68\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.870\nWell I kind of gave you an example of it\nas I reach under the counter here and\n\n69\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.820\npick it back up, right?\n\n70\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.380\nSomething you have is like a smart card,\na key fob, right?\n\n71\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.080\nThis is something you have,\nsomething that you possess, right?\n\n72\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.400\nI authenticate.\n\n73\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.860\nThis authentication factor, again,\n\n74\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.380\nis based on something that\nI have in my possession.\n\n75\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.386\nAll right, something you are,\nwhat is something you are,\n\n76\n00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:38.260\nsomething you are is a physical\ncharacteristic of yourself right?\n\n77\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.160\nI want you to think biometrics,\n\n78\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.480\nbiometrics falls under this, everything\nin biometrics is something you are,\n\n79\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.130\nwhether it's a finger print, scanner,\nwhether it's a voice recognition scanner.\n\n80\n00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.850\nZach and I have talked about this, you\nmentioned one the a hand geometry scanner,\n\n81\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.170\nright, taking basically mapping\ngrid points, if you will,\n\n82\n00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.545\nacross what your hand looks like,\nright, retinal scanners, iris scanners.\n\n83\n00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.545\nThese are all forms of something you are.\n\n84\n00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:06.985\nWell, how about these last two.\n\n85\n00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:11.635\nThese last two are I don't wanna say new.\n\n86\n00:04:11.635 --> 00:04:13.715\nThey been around for a while, right?\n\n87\n00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:18.635\nSomewhere you are, we talked about another\nepisode to geofencing, right Zach?\n\n88\n00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:21.775\nI know you're very familiar with\ngeofencing based on a company you used to\n\n89\n00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:23.030\nwork for, right?\n\n90\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.510\nCreating those virtual boundaries that\ngive you access based on the location\n\n91\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.220\nthat you are, you have access to this\ninformation, sensitive information, right.\n\n92\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.040\nIf you're not in that location,\n\n93\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.900\nwe have some kind of geofencing\nsoftware that says, okay,\n\n94\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.710\nnow we're gonna encrypt that sensitive\ninformation, and we're not even gonna give\n\n95\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.670\nyou access to that sensitive information\ncuz you're no longer in that location.\n\n96\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.580\nThat's somewhere you are.\n\n97\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.600\nSomething you do is an action\nthat you perform consistently\n\n98\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.710\nthat can identify who you are, right,\ngait, right, your walking, your stride.\n\n99\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.490\nI wouldn't be surprised if you don't see\nthis in some kind of Fitbit technology\n\n100\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.470\ncoming down the way that's using\nsome kind of ANT+ technology right,\n\n101\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.650\nand the protocols that we've\ntalked about for monitoring.\n\n102\n00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.100\nSomething you do keyboard pattern\nkeystroke pattern recognition.\n\n103\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.350\nThat's something you do right?\n\n104\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.050\nAll they'd have to do is look at\nhow many times I hit the Delete or\n\n105\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.980\nthe Backspace key and they'd know that\nhe can't spell it's got to be Wes right?\n\n106\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.090\nBut again some kind of pattern\nrecognition that you do,\n\n107\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.030\nright, that is something you do.\n\n108\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.600\nNow, they also talk about\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n109\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.800\nhow do we classify something\nas being multi-factor?\n\n110\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.930\nWell, I want you to know\nthat it takes two or\n\n111\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.070\nmore of the list that we had and\nit combines them all right.\n\n112\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.220\nSo for instance,\nif I have something you have.\n\n113\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.150\nI have this card, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.490\nAnd I have to touch it to\nthe door at the same time,\n\n115\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.610\nI have to put my finger on a biometric\nscanner, that's multi-factor, why?\n\n116\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.880\nIt's something I am, you are,\nand it's something I have.\n\n117\n00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.000\nBe very careful though.\n\n118\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.440\nOn the exam don't let them trip you up.\n\n119\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.390\nAnd their not trying to trick you,\nall right?\n\n120\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.340\nBut one of the things I said when we\ntalked about those authentication factors,\n\n121\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.260\nthe very first thing I said about\nsomething you know, is that a username,\n\n122\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.888\nand password a and security question.\n\n123\n00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:15.130\nWas that multi-faction authentication?\n\n124\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.540\nYou have two steps that\nyou have to take there.\n\n125\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.110\nAnd the answer is no, it is not.\n\n126\n00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.590\nAnd why isn't it?\n\n127\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.280\nIt's both something you know.\n\n128\n00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.850\nIf I put in a username and\npassword, that's something I know.\n\n129\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.740\nIf I put in a PIN,\nthat's something I know, and\n\n130\n00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.270\nthen if I follow it up with a security\nquestion, that's also something I know.\n\n131\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.370\nIt's three of the same\nauthentication factors, so\n\n132\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.370\nit's a single factor authentication,\nright, SFA.\n\n133\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.390\nIf you need a MFA multi factor\nauthentication, you need more than one.\n\n134\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.340\nAll right, two or\nmore of those authentication factors in\n\n135\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.390\norder to validate your credentials right,\nvalidate you are who you say you are.\n\n136\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.450\nAll right now that brings us into\nwe talked about passwords, right?\n\n137\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.650\nAnd passwords and password management,\nis susceptible to basically automated\n\n138\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.390\npassword attacks, it's susceptible to\npeople not using password complexities,\n\n139\n00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.520\nthat's why we implement policies\nought to increase the immunity\n\n140\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.960\nof our passwords to password\nbased attacks, right?\n\n141\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.890\nSo what are some things that you\ncan do to increase security?\n\n142\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.690\nWell, how about if you take the human\nelement completely out of it?\n\n143\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.380\nAll right, and what I'm talking about are\ncertificates, digital certificates, right?\n\n144\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.910\nNow, digital certificates\nare a more complex way\n\n145\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.940\nof managing your authentication.\n\n146\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.620\nRemember complexity and\nsecurity sometimes can go hand in hand.\n\n147\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.670\nThe more complex sometimes\nthe more secured it's gonna be.\n\n148\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.290\nIt doesn't sincerely has to be.\n\n149\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.590\nYou know, you can make things complex and\nthey should be simplistic.\n\n150\n00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.740\nI do that all the time.\n\n151\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.190\nBut let me show you what I mean by that,\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.820\nSo for instance,\nif I want to use certificates, right?\n\n153\n00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.630\nWe start with identification, right?\n\n154\n00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.636\nAnd then what we do is we had\na registration authority.\n\n155\n00:07:56.636 --> 00:08:01.551\nThe registration authority essentially\nis an entity that looks at policies,\n\n156\n00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:02.300\nall right.\n\n157\n00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.726\nIt says, hey,\nare you allowed To have a certificate,\n\n158\n00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:08.866\nlet me see if you adhere\nto whatever the policy is.\n\n159\n00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:11.884\nNow once you adhere to the policy,\nwhat we can do\n\n160\n00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:16.723\nis then transfer you over to an issuing\ncertificate authority, all right?\n\n161\n00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:19.568\nAnd I just happen to have that certificate\nchain that we talked about in other\n\n162\n00:08:19.568 --> 00:08:20.240\nepisodes, too.\n\n163\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.910\nIt has to be followed by a Root CA, too.\n\n164\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.860\nBut usually your Root CAs,\n\n165\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.180\na lot of times they're not\nissuing certificates to entities.\n\n166\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.130\nWhat they're doing is,\nwell, I take that back,\n\n167\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.270\nthey're issuing certificates to a\nsubordinate CA, and those subordinate CAs\n\n168\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.330\nare the ones that actually have the\nworkforce, the public key infrastructure.\n\n169\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.010\nAnd then they issue the certificate\nthat has a key pair,\n\n170\n00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.350\na symmetric key encryption, public key,\nprivate key, and then that's distributed.\n\n171\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.600\nNow it could be distributed to\na couple different entities.\n\n172\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.136\nAnd what I mean by that is it could be\ndistributed to this gentleman, the user,\n\n173\n00:08:54.136 --> 00:08:56.496\nor it could be distributed to a machine.\n\n174\n00:08:56.496 --> 00:09:00.602\nAnd that's important, especially when it\ncomes to Network Access Control, right,\n\n175\n00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:04.314\nNAC, as they call it, Network Access\nControl, the policies, provisions,\n\n176\n00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:07.860\ntechnologies that you implement that\ngovern what devices or what people,\n\n177\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.440\nusers have access to your network.\n\n178\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.740\nWell, when the certificate is installed,\nagain, it can be installed on the machine.\n\n179\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.200\nAnd when it's installed on the machine,\nit's either again,\n\n180\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.840\nissued to the end user or it's issued\nto the machine itself, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.890\nAnd one of the great things about\nissuing a certificate to a user\n\n182\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.840\nis that when a user is using that machine\nand they go to access a resource,\n\n183\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.760\nrather than typing in a user name and\npassword.\n\n184\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.830\nWhich again has all the complexities\nof managing passwords,\n\n185\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.620\nthe computer in the background presents\nthis digital certificate that you manage,\n\n186\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.610\nthat you've issued to that endpoint.\n\n187\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.100\nSo it becomes transparent to the end user.\n\n188\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.070\nOr it could be a machine, right?\n\n189\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.840\nWe have things like Network Device\nEnrollment, where we wanna make sure that\n\n190\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.530\nonly the authorized devices\nhave access to our networks.\n\n191\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.890\nWell, the machine can\npresent a certificate.\n\n192\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.690\nAll right, when the machine presents\na certificate, it either is allowed or\n\n193\n00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.230\nnot allowed, if you will, access depending\nagain on whatever the policy might be.\n\n194\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.280\nSo remember certificates.\n\n195\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.270\nWe deal with certificates a lot.\n\n196\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.650\nYou probably dealt with a certificate and\n\n197\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.140\nmaybe didn't know it when you went to the\nwebsite and started watching this video.\n\n198\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.940\nWhy?\nBecause we have to make sure that\n\n199\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.530\nyour connection is over https,\na secure communication.\n\n200\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.140\nSo when you visited ITPro.TV\nwith your web browser,\n\n201\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.290\nour server or the servers that\nare hosting our website said, hey,\n\n202\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.980\nhere's my digital certificate, and\nit did server authentication, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.140\nAnd really certificates are what\nsecure e-commerce worldwide, right?\n\n204\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.960\nAnytime you visit a site that's got https,\n\n205\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.420\nwhat's happening is that certificate\nis presenting back to your web browser\n\n206\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.800\nits digital driver's license,\nit's digital ID, if you will, all right?\n\n207\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.517\nSo definitely know that certificates are a\nway to authenticate and, as well, govern\n\n208\n00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:57.050\naccess, if you will, or access control,\nin order to gain access to the network.\n\n209\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.190\nNow I also mentioned\nNetwork Access Control, right?\n\n210\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.580\nGive you an example, right?\n\n211\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.740\nFor instance, we have a remote access\nclient, and the remote access client\n\n212\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.240\nwants to make connection into the company\nnetwork through a public network.\n\n213\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.950\nAll right, so they connect, maybe at home,\nright, they connect to the Internet.\n\n214\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:13.907\nAnd then what do they do?\n\n215\n00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:18.269\nThey hit our remote access server, or\nyou could call it a Network Access Server,\n\n216\n00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:19.780\nNAS, if you will.\n\n217\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.025\nNot to be confused with\nthe other NAS device,\n\n218\n00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:27.780\nNetwork-attached Storage, that's just\nan optimized file server, right?\n\n219\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.460\nThey hit the Network Access Server, and\n\n220\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.160\nthe Network Access Server says you're\nmaking a remote access connection request?\n\n221\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.157\nLet me hand you over first to\na Health Registration Authority, an HRA.\n\n222\n00:11:38.157 --> 00:11:43.814\nAnd the Health Registration Authority\nsays, okay, you wanna make a connection?\n\n223\n00:11:43.814 --> 00:11:47.385\nAt the time that the VPN server,\nin this case, the Remote Access Server,\n\n224\n00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:51.132\nhanded over that connection request\nto the Health Registration Authority,\n\n225\n00:11:51.132 --> 00:11:54.127\nit also presented what is known\nas a System Health Validator,\n\n226\n00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:56.250\na statement of health, if you will, SOH.\n\n227\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.270\nAll right, is your firewall turned on?\n\n228\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.940\nIs your computer up to date, right?\n\n229\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.885\nIf it is up to date, do you have,\nand not only is your firewall on,\n\n230\n00:12:03.885 --> 00:12:05.400\ndo you have antivirus software?\n\n231\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.140\nAre the signatures, right, inside of\nthe antivirus software up to date and\n\n232\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.156\nturned on?\n\n233\n00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:14.380\nAnd if any one of these\nchecks don't match,\n\n234\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:20.200\nor the checks are good, what happens is\nwe don't give you access to the network.\n\n235\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.070\nWe actually remediate.\n\n236\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.620\nWe'll send you to what's known\nas an Isolation Network.\n\n237\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.330\nSo that maybe you can remediate, right?\n\n238\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.870\nWe'll have a Remediation Server\nin there that says\n\n239\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.190\nI see you don't have Windows updates.\n\n240\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.920\nWell, we got a WSUS Server\nin this isolated network and\n\n241\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.060\nthat's all you can talk to.\n\n242\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.680\nYou can't talk to the rest of our network\nuntil you pull down those updates,\n\n243\n00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.860\nwhich might even include some\nupdates to Windows Defender, right?\n\n244\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.720\nAnd then once you're updated,\n\n245\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.930\nthat Statement of Health is gonna be sent\nback to the Health Registration Authority.\n\n246\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.780\nAnd the Health Registration Authority\nagain is going to check the policy or\n\n247\n00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.946\nwhat's required compared to what\nyou're telling us, all right?\n\n248\n00:12:55.946 --> 00:12:59.010\nAnd once your statement of health\nmatches what the policy says,\n\n249\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.510\nthen you'll gain access, if you will, to\nthe resources within the network, right?\n\n250\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.820\nSo it's Network Access Control.\n\n251\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:11.190\nAll right, Network Access Protection, NAP,\nit's an older technology and it's kinda\n\n252\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.490\ngoing by the wayside in favor of things\nlike Cisco's Network Access Control,\n\n253\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.560\nwhich is a large system that\ngoverns access to networks, too.\n\n254\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.542\nAll right,\nnow that brings me to another concept,\n\n255\n00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:26.460\nall right, other ways that you\ncan control access to the network\n\n256\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.540\nare through things like Radius and\nTackX+, all right?\n\n257\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.930\nBut before we get into there,\nlet's talk about what they do.\n\n258\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.480\nThey provide an industry wide\nstandard known as authentication,\n\n259\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.400\nwhich we've already talked about,\nauthorization and accounting, all right?\n\n260\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.435\nSo if authorization is just validating\nyou are who you say you are, all right,\n\n261\n00:13:46.435 --> 00:13:49.120\nvalidating a set of credentials,\nto be picky.\n\n262\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.400\nValidating you are who you say you are,\nwho are you?\n\n263\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.491\nWell, you authenticate,\nyou provide your credentials.\n\n264\n00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:57.541\nAuthorization is determining\nthose privileges, rights or\n\n265\n00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:01.800\npermissions that you have to\nthe resources within the network, right?\n\n266\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:09.040\nSo again, we kind of used the cards as an\nexample of Network Access Control, right?\n\n267\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.620\nWell, maybe we have,\nI guess that comes in the building.\n\n268\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.050\nThey have to have a card to get into our,\nto get into ITProTV, right?\n\n269\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.770\nYou guys could stop by here anytime,\nand we give you access.\n\n270\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.920\nBut what you don't have access,\nyour authorization\n\n271\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.620\ndoesn't give you the ability to\ngo into our server closet, right?\n\n272\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.380\nSo authorization is what\nlevel of access do you have.\n\n273\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.948\nWhat permissions do you have, all right?\n\n274\n00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:38.450\nAnd accounting is tracking what resources\nyou accessed or maybe didn't access.\n\n275\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.740\nMaybe you tried to and\ngot denied access, right?\n\n276\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.680\nIt doesn't have to be an acceptance.\n\n277\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.676\nIt could be a rejection.\n\n278\n00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.196\nIt doesn't mean that\nthe authenticating and\n\n279\n00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:51.913\nauthorizing device could actually accept\nyou and allow you access to the resource.\n\n280\n00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:53.070\nIt could be blocking you, right?\n\n281\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.340\nThat's accounting.\n\n282\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:02.410\nAnother way that I've heard somebody\nsay it, the AAA model is who are you?\n\n283\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.330\nWhat are you allowed to do, authorization.\n\n284\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.543\nAnd then the last one,\naccounting, what did you do?\n\n285\n00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:12.559\nSo who are you?\n\n286\n00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:13.220\nWhat can you do?\n\n287\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.470\nAnd accounting, what did you do, right?\n\n288\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.860\nWhich also leads us to things like\nauditing, accounting, auditing,\n\n289\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.030\nif you will, that produces logs that\ncould be then scrutinized, again,\n\n290\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.650\ntracking those system wide activities,\nall right?\n\n291\n00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.930\nNow one of the ways that we do is, the\nindustry wide standard is something known\n\n292\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.082\nas RADIUS, the Remote Access\nDial-In User Service, all right?\n\n293\n00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:37.300\nI'll give you an example here\nof a RADIUS implementation.\n\n294\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.780\nWe have the same remote access client.\n\n295\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.040\nThe remote access client makes\na connection over a public network,\n\n296\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.550\nin this case the Internet,\n\n297\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.170\nmakes connections to kind of like\nthe middle man, probably if you will,\n\n298\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:53.780\na Network Access Server out in the\nDemilitarized Zone, the DMZ, all right?\n\n299\n00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:59.150\nAnd then generates,\ntakes that authentication request and\n\n300\n00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:06.322\nbasically Kinda proxies a RADIUS message\non behalf of the remote access client.\n\n301\n00:16:06.322 --> 00:16:09.350\nSee, our network access servers\nhere are called RADIUS clients.\n\n302\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.550\nCuz what they do is they will\nreceive a connection request\n\n303\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.780\nfrom a remote access client and\nthey'll wrap it or\n\n304\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.410\nencapsulate it in a RADIUS communication\nmessage that can only be interpreted or\n\n305\n00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.500\nstripped off, deincapsulated if you will,\nby the RADIUS server.\n\n306\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.740\nAnd then the RADIUS server,\nif you will, can turn around and\n\n307\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.470\ncommunicate wherever the user data\nbase might be to say, are you the one?\n\n308\n00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.000\nOr should you have access to the network?\n\n309\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.898\nAgain, what are you allowed to do?\n\n310\n00:16:35.898 --> 00:16:39.536\nAnd then it could also send back an\naccounting technology work in track what\n\n311\n00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:40.354\nyou're doing.\n\n312\n00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:44.598\nSo RADIUS again allows you that\nauthentication, authorisation and\n\n313\n00:16:44.598 --> 00:16:48.194\naccounting, it's the industry\nwide standard for that.\n\n314\n00:16:48.194 --> 00:16:50.747\nNow I do want you to understand there\nare some things that you need to know.\n\n315\n00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:52.748\nRADIUS uses UDP.\n\n316\n00:16:52.748 --> 00:16:53.980\nAll right, know that.\n\n317\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.270\nThat mean it's connectionless service,\nall right?.\n\n318\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.270\nAnd I'll come back to why that's\nimportant here in a second.\n\n319\n00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.065\nAlso I want you to remember the ports\nthat it uses too for the exam.\n\n320\n00:17:02.065 --> 00:17:07.980\nUDP port 1812, all right, that is for\nRADIUS authentication messages,\n\n321\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.310\nas well as UDP ports 1813 for\naccounting, RADIUS accounting messages.\n\n322\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.240\nIf you have older network access servers,\nthey could be using some of the old\n\n323\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.800\nport 1645 for RADIUS authentication\nmessages, and 1646 for\n\n324\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.670\nthe RADIUS accounting messages, if\nthey're older NAS Network Access Servers.\n\n325\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.380\nAll right, again this allows us to\ndo the accounting, the logging or\n\n326\n00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.700\nthe authorization, the,\nI get it right here,\n\n327\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.250\nauthentication, authorization and\naccounting.\n\n328\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.880\nNow we typically couple this\ntoo with additional things.\n\n329\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.540\nLike for instance,\n\n330\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.060\nwe go back to the slide here, you'll\ncouple this with things like 802.1x.\n\n331\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.120\nThis is another type of\nnetwork access control, and\n\n332\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.850\nthis is actually down there\nat the physical layer.\n\n333\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:18:00.650\nThis is the IEEE's land\nport based authentication.\n\n334\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.600\nAll right, and\nwhat it does essentially is it uses EAP,\n\n335\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.760\nthe extensible authentication protocol,\nto encapsulate authentication requests and\n\n336\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.380\nit closes the port down once it receives\nthat authentication request and\n\n337\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.520\nthen it can hand off the authentication\nto the radio server.\n\n338\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.940\nAll right, and then, if the RADIUS\nserver will send the challenge\n\n339\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.680\nback through the access point to\nthe remote access client, and say,\n\n340\n00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.870\nhey, you're supposed\nto be on this network.\n\n341\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.120\nProve you are who you say you are,\nauthenticate.\n\n342\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.380\nAnd then it receives that\nauthentication message.\n\n343\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:40.010\nAnd again, it encapsulates it with EAP,\nright, the transport protocol for\n\n344\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.160\nauthentication mechanisms, and\nit sends it back to the RADIUS Server.\n\n345\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.210\nNow once the RADIUS server approves or\nrejects,\n\n346\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.340\nwhichever way it goes, it will send.\n\n347\n00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.540\nLet's say it accepts, it'll send that\ninformation back to the access point,\n\n348\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.400\nthe 802.1x compliant access point, which\nwill then tell the remote access client,\n\n349\n00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.590\nyou've been accepted to connect to\nthe network, or you've been rejected,\n\n350\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.320\nwhichever one happens.\n\n351\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.250\nIf you're rejected, the connection closes.\n\n352\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.990\nAnd then it opens up the port and now\nwe have access into the network, right?\n\n353\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.690\nSo you could see that sometimes you\nhave multiple technologies that\n\n354\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.740\nare combined here.\n\n355\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.700\nAll right, 802.1x can use username and\npasswords.\n\n356\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.180\nBut whether you go to this complexity\nto keep your networks secure,\n\n357\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.900\na lot of times what you're gonna be using\nis the other thing that it also supports\n\n358\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.670\nin that certificate.\n\n359\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.730\nSo which is why you wanted to go ahead and\nkinda mention certificates ahead of time.\n\n360\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:29.580\nNow I did say that RADIUS uses UDP,\nUser Datagram Protocol, and\n\n361\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.430\nit is a connection list service.\n\n362\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.120\nWell, we also have what\nis known as TACACS.\n\n363\n00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.560\nNow, TACACS performs the same type\nof functionalities, if you will,\n\n364\n00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.327\nas RADIUS, and\nmore importantly, it's TACACS+.\n\n365\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.320\nTACACS was terminal access control\naccess control system was a RADIUS like\n\n366\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.350\nimplementation and\nit was the predecessor to TACACS+.\n\n367\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.170\nCisco came on board and\nthey kind of modified it so\n\n368\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.940\nmuch that the two were not compatible, so\n\n369\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.490\nwhat they did is they came out with\nTACACS+ Cisco proprietary and it's so\n\n370\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.030\ndifferent that the original TACACS that\nthey are not compatible with each other.\n\n371\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.100\nNow, it's close to RADIUS,\nbut again it's proprietary.\n\n372\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.520\nIt uses transmission control protocol\ninstead of UDP like RADIUS uses.\n\n373\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.330\nSo it's considered a little bit more\nreliable cuz it's using that connection\n\n374\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.060\noriented service.\n\n375\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.810\nNow the other thing you\nhave to keep in mind too\n\n376\n00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.810\nis that it uses an encrypted wide process.\n\n377\n00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.460\nSo all of these messages that are going\nfrom the remote access client\n\n378\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.010\ninto the TACACS servers\nare essentially encrypted.\n\n379\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.760\nThey're scrambled.\n\n380\n00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.974\nSo it adds a layer of protection.\n\n381\n00:20:37.974 --> 00:20:41.040\nIt uses Port 49,\nthat's what I want you to remember.\n\n382\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.475\nKeep in mind that the authentication\nserver can also be known as a TACACS+\n\n383\n00:20:45.475 --> 00:20:49.980\ndaemon or just TACACSd, so\njust a couple of names there.\n\n384\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.720\nBut it still performs\nthe same AAA process.\n\n385\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.650\nBut it can actually separate the\nauthorization and the accounting which can\n\n386\n00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.280\nbe convenient if you want more than one\nserver to actually handle that process.\n\n387\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.510\nSo it separates those processes which is\na little bit different than a radius so\n\n388\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.100\nthat you can actually have\nthe authentication or\n\n389\n00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.930\nthe authorization in the accounting\non separate devices.\n\n390\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.939\nThey don't have to be like a radio server\nwhere it's all contained into one,\n\n391\n00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:16.670\nall right?\n\n392\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.910\nAll right, couple more things that we\nneed to talk about before we call it\n\n393\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:21.970\nour episode here.\n\n394\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.620\nWe gotta talk about what's known is\nlocal authentication, all right?\n\n395\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.550\nLocal authentication.\n\n396\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.870\nA lot of times we don't wanna use local\nauthentication, and let me tell you why.\n\n397\n00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.070\nThat's a decentralized network model.\n\n398\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.560\nAnd what it means is that if\nyou're using local authentication,\n\n399\n00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:44.280\nevery client within your network has\nto have its own database of users.\n\n400\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.890\nThey don't trust other\nclients' user databases.\n\n401\n00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.000\nAll right, and what I mean by that is,\nif we have two clients, let's say Zach's\n\n402\n00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.340\ndesktop and my desktop, if I want\nZach to have access to my computer,\n\n403\n00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.220\nI have to create Zach\nan account on my computer.\n\n404\n00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:04.950\nZach's got an account on his computer,\nbut that doesn't help this computer.\n\n405\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.715\nThis computer doesn't understand that hey,\n\n406\n00:22:06.715 --> 00:22:09.590\nZach's already got an account on his\ncomputer, it doesn't trust that, right?\n\n407\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.150\nIt's completely decentralized.\n\n408\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:16.160\nEach individual computer maintains it's\nown user account database, all right?\n\n409\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:24.360\nIt becomes a nightmare to manage user\naccounts in a decentralized environment.\n\n410\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.480\nWe want centralized account management.\n\n411\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.770\nIt makes our jobs a lot\neasier when it comes to\n\n412\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.490\nbasically just password management, user\nmanagement, centralized administration.\n\n413\n00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.190\nThat's why we use things like domains.\n\n414\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.160\nIn domain environments like a Windows\nenvironment, right, you're gonna be using\n\n415\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.160\nsomething like Active Directory\ndirectory services, right?\n\n416\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.810\nIt's a directory services database.\n\n417\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.050\nAnd we can create all\nthe users in one location,\n\n418\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.180\nwe can manage their\npasswords in one location.\n\n419\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.650\nIn this case, if our computers are members\nof that database, members of the domain,\n\n420\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:04.660\nthen that means Zach will be able\nto log onto my computer and more\n\n421\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.100\nimportantly the administrators can manages\nhis account and my account from that\n\n422\n00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.910\ncentralized location rather than having\nto go into each individual computer.\n\n423\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:15.850\nThe other thing, too, is when you do local\nauthentication, remember like for instance\n\n424\n00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:20.830\nin a Windows environment that your user\naccounts is controlled by something known\n\n425\n00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.240\nas the Security Accounts Manager, and\nthat database is actually the SAM file.\n\n426\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.540\nWhen I log on locally, it is the SAM\nfile that is checked, and again,\n\n427\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.912\nit's the local operating system, if you\nwill, that is doing the authentication.\n\n428\n00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:37.438\nIt means I only have access to\nthe resources that are on that machine.\n\n429\n00:23:37.438 --> 00:23:39.091\nWhen it comes to resource access,\n\n430\n00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:42.343\nif you're doing centralized\nmanagement in a domain environment.\n\n431\n00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:45.365\nThen what happens is when Zach or\nI, either one,\n\n432\n00:23:45.365 --> 00:23:48.850\nlog on to any machine that's\nalso a part of that domain.\n\n433\n00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.951\nWhat we're gonna do is\nuse something like LDAP,\n\n434\n00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:54.386\nthe lightweight directory access protocol,\nwell, the computers will do it,\n\n435\n00:23:54.386 --> 00:23:56.709\ncommunicate with the directory\nservices database.\n\n436\n00:23:56.709 --> 00:24:00.424\nYour user account your credentials, your\nauthorization is gonna be checked right\n\n437\n00:24:00.424 --> 00:24:03.819\nthere and then your permissions and\nprivileges that you have will be applied\n\n438\n00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:08.300\nto the session after you've logged in and\nagain it's centralized management.\n\n439\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.350\nAnd that makes our [LAUGH]\nlives a lot easier.\n\n440\n00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.900\nNow I will tell you speaking of\ncentralized management, one thing that\n\n441\n00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.680\nalso makes our lives a lot easier is\nwhen you have what is known as SSO.\n\n442\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.040\nAll right SSO is just an acronym another\nalphabet soup here that means single sign\n\n443\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.790\non, right?\n\n444\n00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.430\nAnd this is great for things like, again,\nmaking it a little bit more convenient for\n\n445\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:35.390\nyour end users at the same time making\nit a little bit easier potentially for\n\n446\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.140\nyour administrators.\n\n447\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.740\nWhen you do a single sign on what happens\nis you validate a set of credentials once.\n\n448\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.323\nAnd then you access multiple resources and\nyou don't have to reenter your password.\n\n449\n00:24:46.323 --> 00:24:48.536\nAll right, let me give you\nan example if you're not aware\n\n450\n00:24:48.536 --> 00:24:51.031\nof a corporate environment like\nan active directory domain when\n\n451\n00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:52.431\nwe're doing something like that.\n\n452\n00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:57.229\nLet me give you an example of something\nmaybe you do or familiar with, right?\n\n453\n00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.470\nLet's say Google.\n\n454\n00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.782\nGoogle actually allows you a single\nsign on implementation, right?\n\n455\n00:25:00.782 --> 00:25:02.779\nIf I log in to Gmail, right?\n\n456\n00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:06.351\nI log in to my Gmail,\nI can then turn around and\n\n457\n00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:09.923\nI can launch Google Hangouts and\nguess what?\n\n458\n00:25:09.923 --> 00:25:11.606\nI'm signed into both places, right?\n\n459\n00:25:11.606 --> 00:25:15.413\nCuz it's both owned by Google,\nboth services are owned by Google, but\n\n460\n00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:19.919\nI logged into Google's platform and now I\ncan also access not only Google Hangouts,\n\n461\n00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.400\nI can access Google Drive.\n\n462\n00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.008\nI could access YouTube, but I never\nhad to re-authenticate my credentials.\n\n463\n00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:25.529\nThat's single sign on.\n\n464\n00:25:25.529 --> 00:25:28.532\nNow the way we can implement\na signal sign on and\n\n465\n00:25:28.532 --> 00:25:33.230\nthings like an active directory domain\nis something known as Kerberos.\n\n466\n00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.214\nKerberos, again,\nis a single sign on implementation,\n\n467\n00:25:38.214 --> 00:25:42.940\nit's a time sensitive ticket\ngranting authentication mechanism.\n\n468\n00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.162\nAnd it's the primary authentication\nmechanism inside of an active\n\n469\n00:25:46.162 --> 00:25:47.940\ndirectory domain.\n\n470\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.040\nSo what happens?\n\n471\n00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.720\nWell, what happens is when the user\nlogs on and their authenticated,\n\n472\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.440\nthey communicate with a Kerberos server.\n\n473\n00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.890\nIn this case its gonna be the domain\ncontroller inside of an active directories\n\n474\n00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.730\nservices environment.\n\n475\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.700\nAnd the Kerberos server\nissues a time stamped ticket,\n\n476\n00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.670\nits called a TGT,\nits a ticket granting ticket.\n\n477\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.940\nAnd that's stored on the computer,\nall right?\n\n478\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.160\nAnd then when you go to access a resource,\nthe user does,\n\n479\n00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.300\naccess a resource,\nit doesn't present the TGT,\n\n480\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.890\nthe ticket granting ticket if you will,\nto the resource.\n\n481\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:25.100\nWhat it does is it actually presents\nthat TGT back to the Kerberos server.\n\n482\n00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.630\nThe Kerberos server inspects\nthe information on it.\n\n483\n00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.760\nYou might say, well, why would the server\ninspect the information on it?\n\n484\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.930\nDidn't it just sign it to it?\n\n485\n00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.405\nWell, what happens if I'm\neavesdropping on your network?\n\n486\n00:26:35.405 --> 00:26:39.640\nAnd the TGT is passed over to you,\nand I capture it, all right?\n\n487\n00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.640\nAnd maliciously, I try to replay it to\nthe server, let's say an hour from now,\n\n488\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.990\nall right?\n\n489\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.410\nWell the reason that Kerberos server is\ninspecting the ticket is it's inspecting\n\n490\n00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.412\nthe time stamp, all right?\n\n491\n00:26:49.412 --> 00:26:52.760\nAnd it has to be within five minutes\nby default, like in a Windows domain,\n\n492\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.080\nit's a five minute variance.\n\n493\n00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.970\nAny more than that, then it's invalidated\nand it doesn't trust it, throws it out and\n\n494\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.080\nyou don't get access to the resource.\n\n495\n00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.310\nSo the TGT is presented back\nto the Kerberos server.\n\n496\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.820\nAnd what the Kerberos server does\nupon validating that TGT, says okay,\n\n497\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.660\nit's current,\nyou should have access to this resource.\n\n498\n00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.220\nIs a second ticket is issued to\nthe client, and that's a service ticket.\n\n499\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.880\nAnd the service ticket is actually\nwhat's presented to the device or\n\n500\n00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.570\ncomponent that is storing the resource\nthat you're trying to get access to.\n\n501\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.300\nIt's not the TGT.\n\n502\n00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.060\nBut the resource,\n\n503\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.160\nin this case the resource server,\ntrusts the service ticket.\n\n504\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.140\nWhy does it trust the service ticket?\n\n505\n00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.960\nWell, it trusts the authority that\nissued the service ticket, all right?\n\n506\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.410\nIt trusts the Kerberos server.\n\n507\n00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.520\nSo it doesn't even have to worry about it.\n\n508\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.610\nIt inspects the service ticket, says, okay\nit was the Kerberos server that you had to\n\n509\n00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.812\nhave got that from,\nhere's access to your resources.\n\n510\n00:27:41.812 --> 00:27:47.528\nAll right, now the effect on the end user\nis that if I have permissions, right?\n\n511\n00:27:47.528 --> 00:27:52.760\nIn the ACL, the access control list,\nI have permissions to that resource then\n\n512\n00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:58.151\nI logged on to the domain one time and I\naccessed the shared resource in this case,\n\n513\n00:27:58.151 --> 00:28:00.950\nI don't have to reenter my credentials.\n\n514\n00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.860\nSo you also get that single\nsign on benefit, all right?\n\n515\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.580\nTwo more things I'd like to about,\nactually three more things, all right?\n\n516\n00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.594\nOne is port security,\nwe talk about port security.\n\n517\n00:28:08.594 --> 00:28:13.766\nRemember port security can be handled by,\nwell, really by 802.1X,\n\n518\n00:28:13.766 --> 00:28:17.885\nclosing down the port while\nauthentication is happening.\n\n519\n00:28:17.885 --> 00:28:21.150\nCould be through things\nlike MAC filtering.\n\n520\n00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.530\nOnly these MAC addresses that we receive\non this port, or this MAC address,\n\n521\n00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.560\nis going to be allowed to send\ninformation into the access port.\n\n522\n00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.560\nAnything else is gonna be rejected, right?\n\n523\n00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.840\nSo there are things that you could do for\nport security too.\n\n524\n00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.830\nLast but not least, is captive portal.\n\n525\n00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.550\nThe captive portal is probably\nsomething that you have seen before.\n\n526\n00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.470\nIf you've ever gone to a hotel and\nyou wanna jump on their wireless network.\n\n527\n00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.530\nWhat happens?\n\n528\n00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.730\nWell, when you go to connect to the\nnetwork, it redirects you to a website and\n\n529\n00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:49.126\nit says you have to enter, let's say,\nyour room number and a PIN, or a password,\n\n530\n00:28:49.126 --> 00:28:50.183\nif you will, all right?\n\n531\n00:28:50.183 --> 00:28:51.380\nWhat does it do?\n\n532\n00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.130\nIt doesn't really give you\nany Internet connectivity.\n\n533\n00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.510\nIt reduces the Internet connectivity\nto just that page until\n\n534\n00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.620\nyou put in the authenticating information.\n\n535\n00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.820\nAnd then if you have the authorization\nto actually join their wireless network,\n\n536\n00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.500\nfrom there, you'll be able to access it.\n\n537\n00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.600\nIf not, well then, it's just like anything\nelse, you put in the wrong password or\n\n538\n00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.400\nyou're not supposed to be there,\nit's gonna shut down.\n\n539\n00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.145\nKnow what a captive portal is as well.\n\n540\n00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:18.180\nThese are some of the things that you have\nto know when it comes to authentication\n\n541\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.220\nand access control.\n\n542\n00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.760\nRemember, authentication, who are you?\n\n543\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.510\nAuthorization, what can you do?\n\n544\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.630\nAccounted, what did you do?\n\n545\n00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:30.510\nKnowing some of these subjects will make\nit a lot easier for your Net Plus exam.\n\n546\n00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.240\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Wes.\n\n547\n00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.317\nAuthentication and\n\n548\n00:29:33.317 --> 00:29:36.933\nAccess Control, wonderful episode\ninside of the Net Plus Series.\n\n549\n00:29:36.933 --> 00:29:39.880\nAnd you wanna make sure you\nwatch everything in the series.\n\n550\n00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.930\nWes did a wonderful job of\nputting it all together for you.\n\n551\n00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.650\nAnd when you're in that course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos,\n\n552\n00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.600\nand they're all there to help you go for\na visit.\n\n553\n00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.840\nCheck those out too.\n\n554\n00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.170\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n555\n00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.040\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n556\n00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.380\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n557\n00:29:52.380 -->

00:00:06.055\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:11.672\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.340\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.981\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with accelerated Net+.\n\n8\n00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.186\nNetwork Device Hardening is\nthe title of this episode, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.117\nWes Bryan is here to show us the way.\n\n10\n00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:26.440\nWes, great to have you.\n\n11\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.482\nThanks for being here.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach,\n\n12\n00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.111\nthanks for having me back.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we are gonna be looking\n\n13\n00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:34.200\nat some of the ways that we can\nsecure our devices a little bit more.\n\n14\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.283\nSo if you're not aware of the term\nhardening, what does that mean?\n\n15\n00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:40.830\nWell, hardening a device means you're\nreducing its attack surface, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.838\nWe're trying to plug the holes in the dam,\nif you will,\n\n17\n00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:47.807\nso that we don't have a point of entry for\npeople who would otherwise hit us\n\n18\n00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:50.960\nmaliciously with some kind of exploit or\nattack, right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.952\nSo hardening a device is just\nstrengthening its immunity to attack,\n\n20\n00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:56.560\nright?\n\n21\n00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.322\nYou reduce the attack surface by\nclosing off certain things that\n\n22\n00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.712\npeople could exploit, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:06.340\nSo that's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.869\nAnd we're gonna go through a few of the\nexam objectives that you should be aware\n\n25\n00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.420\nof when you are going\nto sit that Net+ exam.\n\n26\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.122\nOne of the first things I wanna talk about\nis well, changing default passwords or\n\n27\n00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:19.800\nchanging, I should say,\ndefault credentials, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.300\nWe say credentials,\nit's username and password, really.\n\n29\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.650\nAnd this happens a lot, right, especially\nwhen you get networking devices.\n\n30\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.106\nYou get networking devices and you fire\nthem up for the very first time, and well,\n\n31\n00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:31.824\nguess what?\n\n32\n00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.910\nThey're ready to go, right out of the box.\n\n33\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.887\nI could plug a device in, plug it, for\ninstance, a connectivity device in.\n\n34\n00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:41.740\nI could plug it in, I could plug\ndevices into its ports, right?\n\n35\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.865\nAnd we're ready to go.\n\n36\n00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:44.193\nBut the problem is,\n\n37\n00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:49.280\nsome of the default configurations\ncan cause some problems, all right?\n\n38\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.658\nFor one, a lot of times these devices\ncome with default configurations.\n\n39\n00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:56.230\nAnd here's the problem with\ndefault configurations.\n\n40\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.653\nA default configuration means that\nthat configuration is applied to\n\n41\n00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.874\nevery single one of those models.\n\n42\n00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:07.051\nAnd everybody can gain access to that\ninformation just by talking to the vendor\n\n43\n00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:11.483\nand saying, hey, frequently asked\nquestions, what's the default username and\n\n44\n00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:15.080\npassword to this Wi-Fi router or\nWi-Fi access point, right?\n\n45\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.838\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n46\n00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:20.349\nI'm on a Linksys Wi-Fi router,\nbasically the web interface to, well,\n\n47\n00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.290\na wireless access point, and\nthis is the default configuration, right?\n\n48\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.031\nYou plug the wireless access point in and\nyou fired it up and guess what?\n\n49\n00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:32.478\nYou can turn around and you can plug\na wired device into the ports on that\n\n50\n00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.410\nwireless access point and\nyou're up and running, right?\n\n51\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.441\nSo you can get up and\nrunning really fast, but\n\n52\n00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:39.428\nit doesn't mean that the device is secure.\n\n53\n00:02:39.428 --> 00:02:42.971\nSo we need to steer away from some of\nthose default credentials cuz well,\n\n54\n00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:43.880\nguess what?\n\n55\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.038\nThe default credential\nuser name of admin and\n\n56\n00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:48.377\nthen whatever the default password is,\nright?\n\n57\n00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:53.250\nWell, if I leave this at the default,\nZach could find out what the model is.\n\n58\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.996\nIn this case,\nit's an E8350 wireless Linksys device,\n\n59\n00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:01.262\nand he could go to the vendor and\nfind out.\n\n60\n00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:04.423\nWhat is the default username and\npassword to log into your router for\n\n61\n00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:07.220\nthe very first time for\nfirst configuration, right?\n\n62\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.028\nSo if he can gain access\nto that information,\n\n63\n00:03:09.028 --> 00:03:10.989\nit means this device\nreally isn't that secure.\n\n64\n00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.293\nSo what we have to do is\nwe have to get in here and\n\n65\n00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.685\nwe have to change those\ndefault credentials.\n\n66\n00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:18.342\nNow sometimes you can change the username.\n\n67\n00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:21.844\nThis one doesn't allow you the ability\nto change the username, but\n\n68\n00:03:21.844 --> 00:03:25.477\nwhat it does allow you to do is\nchange the router's password, right?\n\n69\n00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:29.166\nSo he might still have one piece of the\npuzzle if he goes to the vendor's website.\n\n70\n00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.470\nHey, well,\nI know that the username is admin.\n\n71\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.804\nBut does he know what my password is now,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:36.828\nAnd that's why we wanna use\nthings like strong passwords.\n\n73\n00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.608\nAnd we wanna change those defaults, right,\n\n74\n00:03:39.608 --> 00:03:44.668\nto make sure that somebody can't just\ngain access to your device freely, right?\n\n75\n00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:46.990\nSteer away from those default credentials.\n\n76\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.500\nChange the administrative username and\npassword is very, very important, right?\n\n77\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.988\nAnd speaking of passwords, see, that's\nanother thing that we have to worry about,\n\n78\n00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:56.590\ntoo, right?\n\n79\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.886\nWhen it comes to passwords,\n\n80\n00:03:57.886 --> 00:04:00.647\nyou have to increase the strength\nof your password, right?\n\n81\n00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:01.870\nHow do we do that?\n\n82\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.090\nWell, there's something known\nas password complexity, right?\n\n83\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.659\nOne of the things that we do is we make\nsure that we're using one of each of\n\n84\n00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.243\nthe four character sets, right, uppercase\nletters, lowercase letters, numbers, and\n\n85\n00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:13.810\nspecial characters, right?\n\n86\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.109\nWhen we mix all of those character\nsets in there, we start increasing\n\n87\n00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.421\nthe password's immunity to things\nlike password-based attacks.\n\n88\n00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:26.220\nSoftware that can help automate\nthe process and try to crack or\n\n89\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.420\nbreak the password, if you will.\n\n90\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.673\nThe other thing that you have to do is,\nwell, avoid common passwords.\n\n91\n00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:37.310\nAnd you would be surprised because\npeople want convenience, right?\n\n92\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.046\nAnd the IT side,\nthey want security, right?\n\n93\n00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:44.938\nIt's a really fine balance that I have no\nclue where that line is drawn because if\n\n94\n00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:48.500\nwe increase security, a lot of times\nwe decrease convenience, right?\n\n95\n00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.738\nBecause if I tell you, you have to\nhave a 20-character password, and\n\n96\n00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:53.648\nit's only gonna be good for a week, well,\n\n97\n00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:56.640\nthat's gonna be pretty complex to\ntry to maintain that password.\n\n98\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.600\nAnd I mean,\nyou're gonna start writing it down.\n\n99\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.890\nAnd so we have problems anyways, right?\n\n100\n00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.550\nSo password management's very hard.\n\n101\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.850\nBut one of the things that you can tell\nyour users is, well, you know what?\n\n102\n00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.440\nStay away from common passwords, right?\n\n103\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.125\nLet me give you an example here.\n\n104\n00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.540\nWe're up on Wikipedia here,\n\n105\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.060\nand notice that they've got a great\nlist if you ever wanna check this out.\n\n106\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.825\nAnd again, it's all free, right?\n\n107\n00:05:16.825 --> 00:05:17.785\nIt's in the public domain.\n\n108\n00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:20.010\nA list of the most common passwords,\nright?\n\n109\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.350\nAnd if you look over the years,\n\n110\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.582\nyou will see some of the same\npasswords keep showing up.\n\n111\n00:05:26.582 --> 00:05:28.339\nAll right, well, guess what?\n\n112\n00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.691\nIf Wikipedia knows it, a lot of those\npassword cracking software will have lists\n\n113\n00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:36.160\nthat already include these\ncommon passwords, right?\n\n114\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.953\nAnd what they can do is they can speed up\nthe process by just loading the list into\n\n115\n00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:41.861\nmemory and rifling through that list.\n\n116\n00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:44.840\nAnd if your common password is in there,\nwell, guess what?\n\n117\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.155\nIt isn't going to take them too\nlong to get into your device.\n\n118\n00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:49.980\nSo we wanna stay away from passwords,\nright?\n\n119\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.520\nAnd you can see that some of these\npasswords are just simply running your\n\n120\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.284\nfingers right across the keyboard, right?\n&gt;&gt; If you look at qwerty, right?\n\n121\n00:05:57.284 --> 00:06:01.835\nThat's Q-W-E-R-T-Y, that's right across,\nleft to right, atop of the keyboard.\n\n122\n00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:06.740\nAnd some of the other ones, abc123,\nright, Jackson 5 song, right?\n\n123\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.075\nThe other one that we got here, too, and\nsome of these other ones, I was like,\n\n124\n00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:13.601\nI didn't know exactly\nwhat I was looking at.\n\n125\n00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:16.168\nBut you will see some of the other ones,\n1212,\n\n126\n00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:20.250\ngotta love that one, right?\n&gt;&gt; Passwords, some of the Microsoft super\n\n127\n00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.800\nsecret passwords that we only\nare supposed to be using in training.\n\n128\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.319\nUnfortunately sometimes people,\nwe can remember them, right?\n\n129\n00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.300\nAnd if it's easy to remember,\nit increases the convenience, but\n\n130\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.060\nwhat does it do to security, right?\n\n131\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.635\nIt makes your device a lot\nmore susceptible to attack.\n\n132\n00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:38.637\nSorry, we wanna harden the device\nby steering away from these common\n\n133\n00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:39.880\npasswords, right?\n\n134\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.054\nNow the next thing that we have to talk\nabout is upgrading firmware, right?\n\n135\n00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:47.582\nUpgrading firmware is important because,\nwell for one,\n\n136\n00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:51.910\nupgrading firmware will fix\nfunctionality flaws, fix bugs, right?\n\n137\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.243\nAnd increase the performance sometimes,\nof the device.\n\n138\n00:06:55.243 --> 00:06:59.470\nSometimes it gives you extra,\nadditional capabilities that earlier\n\n139\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.810\nfirmware versions didn't have,\nand that's important.\n\n140\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.594\nNow one of the ways that you can do this,\nlet me show you here.\n\n141\n00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:07.666\nBack on our LINKSYS router here,\n\n142\n00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:11.526\none of the things I can do is I\ncan go to the Administration tab.\n\n143\n00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:14.699\nAnd this is gonna be specific to LINKSYS,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.280\nFor the most part, you should be able to\nfind a lot of these settings fairly easy.\n\n145\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.969\nThere is a commonality,\nbut the user interface, or\n\n146\n00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.362\nthe UI might be just\na little bit of different.\n\n147\n00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:26.170\nBut notice that we have\nthe firmware upgrade, right?\n\n148\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.938\nUpgrading your firmware here, don't take\nthis lightly because you could see, and\n\n149\n00:07:29.938 --> 00:07:32.872\nit lets you know, upgrading\nthe firmware may take a few minutes.\n\n150\n00:07:32.872 --> 00:07:36.010\nDon't turn off the power or\npress the Reset button.\n\n151\n00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.733\nUpgrade must not be interrupted!\n\n152\n00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:41.870\nDon't do this [LAUGH] when you run\nthe risk of losing power, right?\n\n153\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.192\nYou don't wanna do this\nduring a lightning storm,\n\n154\n00:07:44.192 --> 00:07:47.540\ncuz what happens is, again,\nremember when you're updating firmware,\n\n155\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.360\nthose of you that are coming\nover from A+ probably know this.\n\n156\n00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.460\nYou're sending an electrical current\ninto an EEPROM chip that is overwriting\n\n157\n00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.140\nthe instructions that start\nthe hardware and control that hardware.\n\n158\n00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.151\nAnd if you interrupt that process You\ncould permanently ruin the device.\n\n159\n00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.761\nThey call it breaking the device, right?\n\n160\n00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:08.079\nSo, upgrading your firmware is important\nbecause it also fixes not only\n\n161\n00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:12.397\nfunctionality flaws, but if there\nare security exploits that happen,\n\n162\n00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:16.997\na lot of times what your manufacturers\nwill do is before that security exploit\n\n163\n00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:20.535\nhits the wild, then they'll\nscramble really hard to try to\n\n164\n00:08:20.535 --> 00:08:24.040\nclose that security exploit\nby having firmware updates.\n\n165\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.220\nAt the time of this recording, here in\n2018, there was the spectrum meltdown.\n\n166\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.890\nCPU vulnerability that was happening right\nwhere there be like for instance side\n\n167\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.960\nchannel attacks where you can pretty much\nhave control of the entire machine, and\n\n168\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.930\nmajor manufacturers including things\nlike Microsoft put out updates that,\n\n169\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.530\nand hardware updates for\nthe hardware manufacturers, if you will,\n\n170\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.780\nthat try to close down\nthe exploits that can happen.\n\n171\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.120\nSo, upgrading your firmware is very,\nvery important.\n\n172\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.300\nNow, one of things that you'll also\nwant to keep in mind is that not only\n\n173\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.120\nupdating and upgrading your firmware,\nyou wanna keep your systems up to date and\n\n174\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.270\npatched too.\n\n175\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.570\nSo for\ninstance here on our Windows 10 machine,\n\n176\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.710\nyou might have a patch management system.\n\n177\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.870\nMy head's gonna cover this up but\nif I go down to the action center, and\n\n178\n00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.690\nthen I bring up all settings here,\n\n179\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.320\nyou'll see that we have a location in\nhere called update &amp; security, right?\n\n180\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.460\nIt's kinda interesting, right?\n\n181\n00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.250\nWe're talking about securing a device.\n\n182\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.620\nIsn't it nice that they say updates and\nsecurity, and\n\n183\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.400\nthey put them right there in\nthe same location, right?\n\n184\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.160\nSo one of the things that I'm gonna\nwanna do is apparently check-out,\n\n185\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.500\nlooks like I had an error here, so I'm\ngoing to want to go back and update that.\n\n186\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.920\nBut you need to make sure that you're\nactively updating your machines, because\n\n187\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.270\nas you update your machines, you do have\nsome of these updates that help too.\n\n188\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.180\nLooks like I've got a bunch of these\nfeature updates that were failing.\n\n189\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.270\nBut we do have other update, so this\nhappens to be a feature that's failing.\n\n190\n00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.956\nIt's not really, if you will,\n\n191\n00:09:45.956 --> 00:09:49.400\nthe updates that actually close\noff security vulnerabilities.\n\n192\n00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.800\nFeatures I am not too worried about,\n\n193\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.254\nbut an update that fixes some kind of\nsecurity flaw, I'm definitely gonna want.\n\n194\n00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:58.780\nAnd let me see if I can find\nany that might actually,\n\n195\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.750\ncan give you some information.\n\n196\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.370\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n197\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.690\nWe've got an example of a security\nupdate for Adobe Flash Player, right?\n\n198\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.400\nAnd it looks, and you can see a security\nissue has been identified in a Microsoft\n\n199\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.830\nsoftware product that\ncould affect your system.\n\n200\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.780\nAll right, notice what it tells you.\n\n201\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.350\nIt tells you, right here,\n\n202\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.870\nyou can help protect your system by\ninstalling this update from Microsoft.\n\n203\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.740\nAnd if you need additional information,\nyou can always click this link.\n\n204\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.190\nAnd what it'll do is it'll take\nyou out to the vendor's website,\n\n205\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.080\nunless apparently you're in\nthe default administrative account.\n\n206\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.440\nIt'll take you out to Microsoft Knowledge\nBase where you can read more of the vendor\n\n207\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.210\nspecific information when it comes\nto whatever that security update\n\n208\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.930\nmight be fixing, right?\n\n209\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.740\nSo again, updating your system and\npatching your systems are important.\n\n210\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.180\nNow, It might not be a one-off like this,\nit could be a one-off like this, but\n\n211\n00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.780\na lot of times, especially in a corporate\nenvironment, or a company environment,\n\n212\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.310\nyou'll have a patch management system.\n\n213\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:53.290\nAnd a patch management system just allows\nyou to review the available patches or\n\n214\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.400\nupdates, to test them out,\nto approve or deny them, and\n\n215\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.270\nthen to the deploy them to many machines\nthroughout your entire network.\n\n216\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.011\nPatch management basically allows you a\nsystematic approach to, again, reviewing,\n\n217\n00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:10.854\ntesting, and implementing patches\nto maintain a level of stability so\n\n218\n00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:13.749\nthat you don't bring your\nproduction environment.\n\n219\n00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:18.043\nSo for instance inside of Windows, they\nhave what's known as the WSUS service,\n\n220\n00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:22.380\nif you will, Windows Service Update\nService, I guess that's redundant.\n\n221\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.140\nBut WSUS, this is where I can say,\nhey all the Windows machines,\n\n222\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.350\nI don't want you to go out to\nMicrosoft's Windows Update,\n\n223\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.590\nright, because you might have some\nproduction machines that have\n\n224\n00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.980\na line of business application that maybe\ncan't take an update, for whatever reason.\n\n225\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.330\nIt breaks that LOB app,\nright, so what do we do?\n\n226\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:46.070\nWe say, go to the internal WSUS server\nwhere an administrator has downloaded,\n\n227\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:51.500\nreviewed, approved, or denied what patches\nthey want to deploy to their systems\n\n228\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.880\nto maintain a level of stability, and you\ndon't bring down your production machines\n\n229\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.590\ninside of your productions networks,\nespecially if it it's a server too.\n\n230\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.610\nEven more so, it'll be important, right?\n\n231\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.630\nThat is very, very important.\n\n232\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.490\nNow, file hashing is something\nthat they also call out as well.\n\n233\n00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.290\nWhy would they call out file hashing,\nwhen it comes to talking about things like\n\n234\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.500\npatches and updates, if you will,\nand firmware updates?\n\n235\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.130\nAll right well remember\nwhat file hashing does.\n\n236\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.050\nAnd if you're not aware remember\nthat a hash, if you will,\n\n237\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.180\nif you take a piece of data, you can\nrun it through a hashing algorithm,\n\n238\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.670\nwhich is a mathematical operation\nthat is performed one way, right?\n\n239\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.420\nYou send clear text into this algorithm\nthat produces a fixed link value.\n\n240\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.570\nAll right, and it doesn't matter the size,\nthe amount of information that goes into\n\n241\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.620\nthe algorithm, the fixed length value\nwill always stay the same length.\n\n242\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.530\nHere's what might change though.\n\n243\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.890\nIf there's a single modification of\nthat file, all right, let's say,\n\n244\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.910\nlet's say there's no modification,\nI download a piece of firmware,\n\n245\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.400\nI want to make sure that it's\nmaintained it's integrity.\n\n246\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.410\nI can go to the vendors website and\nI can find that fixed length value,\n\n247\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.050\nthat check sum, that hash value, and\nwhat they're telling me that if this file,\n\n248\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.810\nthis firmware update has maintained it's\nintegrity, you should run it through\n\n249\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.000\na hashing algorithm,\nlet's say MD5, Sha-1, Sha-256 and\n\n250\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.890\nit should always produce that same\nvalue if it's maintained its integrity.\n\n251\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.910\nNow this is a couple of reasons, because\nremember when we talk about security, we\n\n252\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.310\ntalk about the CIA triad, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n253\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.311\nWell availability is also something you\nwanna worry about too, because you don't\n\n254\n00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:27.959\nwant to download a firmware update,\nhave it be manipulated maliciously, or\n\n255\n00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:32.819\nhave it some kind of integrity mismatch\nbecause of network transmission error,\n\n256\n00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:36.678\nbecause when you apply that update,\nor that firmware upgrade,\n\n257\n00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:40.678\nnow we've got a corrupted file,\nand it could ruin the device, and\n\n258\n00:13:40.678 --> 00:13:44.640\nthen it brings down that device and\nwe have no more availability.\n\n259\n00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.580\nSo, it's important to implement something\nlike file hashing, because what I can do,\n\n260\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.145\ngo to the vendor's website,\nlook at what they say the value is that I\n\n261\n00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:55.535\nshould expect,\ndownload the firmware update, and\n\n262\n00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:59.625\nI can run with a piece of\nsoftware on my local computer.\n\n263\n00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:05.205\nI can run that firmware package through\nthat software using the same algorithm,\n\n264\n00:14:05.205 --> 00:14:10.131\nand if we get the same values then I know\nthat file, that firmware upgrade has\n\n265\n00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:11.690\nmaintained its integrity.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n266\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.900\n&gt;&gt; And that is important.\n\n267\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.180\nIn fact let me show you what I mean here.\n\n268\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.500\nYou can also do this with things\nlike software packages too.\n\n269\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.700\nSo for instance, I got FileZilla here.\n\n270\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.790\nIts an FTP client, right?\n\n271\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.150\nBut let me show you where\nthis might come in handy.\n\n272\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.720\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna create a folder.\n\n273\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.390\nWe're kinda do a little experiment here,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.860\nAnd I'm gonna say FileZilla bundle, right?\n\n275\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.750\nAnd you've probably seen these before,\nZack.\n\n276\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.620\nYou'll get a zip file and\nit's got instruction in it, right?\n\n277\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.840\nAnd then it's got the software in it,\nor maybe it's an update, right?\n\n278\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.330\nAnd it's all bundled together.\n\n279\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.230\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; So what we're going\n\n280\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:47.200\nto do is we're going to drop that file,\nFileZilla executable into this folder.\n\n281\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.580\nAnd I'm gonna make just\na demo read me document.\n\n282\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.880\nYou always find these in there, right?\n\n283\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.220\nRead me.\n\n284\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:59.540\nAll right, and I will say this is my read\n\n285\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.800\nme doc because I am just that creative,\nall right?\n\n286\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.040\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nwe're going to save that ,all right.\n\n287\n00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.043\nNow I'm gonna take this file, and\nwhat I'll do, or the whole folder,\n\n288\n00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:14.738\nI'm gonna send it to a zipped or\na compressed folder, all right?\n\n289\n00:15:14.738 --> 00:15:15.491\nAnd there we go, right.\n\n290\n00:15:15.491 --> 00:15:19.210\nSo we've got our zipped bundle, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n291\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.240\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead, and\n\n292\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.100\nlet's take and run a hashing software.\n\n293\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.470\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just use SHA-1 as our algorithm, and\n\n294\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.400\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say\nI wanna find out what the value is.\n\n295\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.940\nLet's say I downloaded this file, or\n\n296\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.230\nI'm looking at the manufacturers website\nand they tell me what the value is, right?\n\n297\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.829\nSo what they'll do is,\nif it's legitimate software,\n\n298\n00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:44.582\nthey'll run it through\na hashing algorithm, all right,\n\n299\n00:15:44.582 --> 00:15:48.654\nand here's our fixed-length\nvalue that it gives me, right?\n\n300\n00:15:48.654 --> 00:15:53.438\nAnd they'll put that on their website,\nand they'll let you know that hey,\n\n301\n00:15:53.438 --> 00:15:58.072\nif you download this bundle,\nthis zip folder, with our application, or\n\n302\n00:15:58.072 --> 00:16:02.680\nin this case, a firmware upgrade,\nyou should see this value here.\n\n303\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.240\nAll right.\n\n304\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.052\nWatch what happens here.\n\n305\n00:16:04.052 --> 00:16:08.585\nI'm gonna move these around a little bit\nhere because I don't want it to rename\n\n306\n00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:09.790\nthe folder.\n\n307\n00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.840\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take\nthat zipped folder that we just created,\n\n308\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.540\nand I'm just gonna move\nit off to the side here.\n\n309\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.510\nAll right, so now I'm Mr Hacker,\n\n310\n00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.190\nall right,\nI'm gonna put my black hat on, right?\n\n311\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.620\nOr I'm network transmission error.\n\n312\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.040\nEither way it could manipulate the file.\n\n313\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.020\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna open\nup just the read me documentation, right?\n\n314\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.799\nI'm just gonna open up the read me txt and\n\n315\n00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:42.276\nI'm gonna say,\nlet's say this is my malicious code.\n\n316\n00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:46.525\nMuhahahahahaha.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:47.523\n&gt;&gt; All right, [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:16:47.523 --> 00:16:48.379\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n319\n00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Muhahahahahaha.\n\n320\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.840\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n321\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.910\nZach's got our sound effects there,\nperfect.\n\n322\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.710\nAll right, you gotta have the sound\neffects or it doesn't work right.\n\n323\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.680\nAhahahaha, right?\n\n324\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.331\nAnd I'm gonna do the same exact thing,\nI'm gonna just right-click on it and\n\n325\n00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:03.890\nI'm gonna send it to another compressed\nfolder and imagine that, right?\n\n326\n00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.240\nSo, you guys can see.\n\n327\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.500\nAnd let me know, in pictures here,\nnotice how they're the same thing, right?\n\n328\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.306\nSo, I have FileZilla Bundle.zip, right?\n\n329\n00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:19.054\nSo we should be none the wiser, right?\n\n330\n00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:23.576\nBut watch what happens now that\nthe manipulated file in this case,\n\n331\n00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:26.416\nI have downloaded this file, all right?\n\n332\n00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:31.240\nI want to make sure it's maintained its\nintegrity, it's not a transmission error,\n\n333\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.529\nit hasn't been manipulated,\nmuhahaha, maliciously.\n\n334\n00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:39.208\nSo I say I'm gonna check it too, I'm\ngonna run it through the same algorithm.\n\n335\n00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:42.960\nNotice same SHA-1,\nSecure Hashing Algorithm,\n\n336\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.140\nthat's the algorithm that we used.\n\n337\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.998\nBut I want you to notice what happens when\nwe bring back up our notepad here, Zach.\n\n338\n00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:53.779\nAnd I certainly, by all means, don't\nexpect you to just rattle off that whole\n\n339\n00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:58.776\nvalue, but can you see that the values,\njust by looking at the first and the last,\n\n340\n00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:00.746\nthey're different.\n&gt;&gt; They are different.\n\n341\n00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.909\n&gt;&gt; They are different, right?\n\n342\n00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:06.515\nAnd that's why file hashing is important,\nbecause you want to make sure that when\n\n343\n00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:09.853\nyou download a piece of firmware,\nyou download an update,\n\n344\n00:18:09.853 --> 00:18:13.680\nyou want to make sure that it's\nmaintained its integrity, right?\n\n345\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.930\nEspecially with firmware updates.\n\n346\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.524\nA lot of times when you have updates like\nWindows you're going to be reaching out to\n\n347\n00:18:18.524 --> 00:18:21.755\na Windows update server and they're\ngoing to manage and maintain that for\n\n348\n00:18:21.755 --> 00:18:22.396\nyou, right?\n\n349\n00:18:22.396 --> 00:18:25.597\nIf you do a YUM and an install,\nyou're going to reach out to a repo, or\n\n350\n00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:28.710\na repository, and they're going\nto manage all of that for you.\n\n351\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.540\nBut if you're doing things like\nstandalone downloads like this,\n\n352\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.030\nor downloading individual firmware\npackages, you're gonna want to make\n\n353\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.650\nsure that they haven't been manipulated\nmaliciously, because who knows?\n\n354\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.600\nSomebody put a backdoor Trojan\nin that firmware update.\n\n355\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.890\nYou update or upgrade your firmware\nthinking, hey, I'm hardening my device,\n\n356\n00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.350\nand you've now paved the way for other\nattacks that you're none the wiser if you\n\n357\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.520\nwouldn't have been running something\nlike a file hashing program, right?\n\n358\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.789\nSo, great way to make sure that files have\nmaintained their integrity, and especially\n\n359\n00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:04.145\nwhen they're important data files, things\nlike firmware upgrades and patches right?\n\n360\n00:19:04.145 --> 00:19:08.395\nOther things you that you need to\nworry about is unnecessary services.\n\n361\n00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:10.475\nAll right,\nnow what's an unnecessary service, right?\n\n362\n00:19:10.475 --> 00:19:12.445\nWell, a service that's unnecessary.\n\n363\n00:19:12.445 --> 00:19:13.105\nCase dismissed.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:15.995\n&gt;&gt; No, what it is is we have services.\n\n365\n00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:18.355\nIn fact let me show you\non my Windows 10 machine.\n\n366\n00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:21.460\nAnd those of you,\nif you're coming over from 8 plus should\n\n367\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.160\nreally already be aware of this, but\nif you're not, let's not assume here.\n\n368\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.430\nI'm gonna launch up the services console,\nright?\n\n369\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.040\nWhen you launch up the services console,\n\n370\n00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.360\nyou can see a lot of the background\nprocesses that run on the machine,\n\n371\n00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.110\nand a lot of times we don't\nhave any interaction with them.\n\n372\n00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.450\nRight, these run as part of the user\nexperience, as part of keeping\n\n373\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.420\nthe operating system functional or\nperform some kind of other functionality.\n\n374\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.810\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n375\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.460\nNot every one of this services\nnecessarily needs to be running.\n\n376\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.720\nAll right, and let me tell you why.\n\n377\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.066\nThere are instances where you\ndownload an application and\n\n378\n00:19:56.066 --> 00:20:00.788\nit creates or even starts a service that\nyou are unaware of by default, all right?\n\n379\n00:20:00.788 --> 00:20:02.750\nLet me give you an example.\n\n380\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.696\nSometimes when you need\na stand alone database,\n\n381\n00:20:04.696 --> 00:20:07.982\nyou've got an application that just\nrequires communication with the database.\n\n382\n00:20:07.982 --> 00:20:12.340\nAnd you're not setting up or\nstanding up a database server anywhere.\n\n383\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.390\nIt's just gonna run locally\non that machine to allow\n\n384\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:15.980\nyou to use the application.\n\n385\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.041\nWell, it can install things and run things\nlike SQL Reporting Services, right?\n\n386\n00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:25.540\nThat's a network communication,\nyou've opened a hole in the dam, right?\n\n387\n00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.770\nHardening is reducing that attack surface\nand if you have a service that has\n\n388\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.980\nnow been turned on and you don't need it,\nyou've got a problem, right?\n\n389\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.974\nYou need to close that service down.\n\n390\n00:20:35.974 --> 00:20:39.169\nLike so for instance I could\ndo something like this and\n\n391\n00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:43.430\nyou might be doing something like\nactually monitoring this yourself.\n\n392\n00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.080\nIt might be some kind of security baseline\nthat you run and then perform later and\n\n393\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.930\nfind, hey.\n\n394\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:52.340\nWhen I originally ran the security\nbaseline, that service wasn't running.\n\n395\n00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.762\nBut I rerun the same baseline and\n\n396\n00:20:53.762 --> 00:20:57.035\nnow its running and it makes me aware\nthat something's changed, right?\n\n397\n00:20:57.035 --> 00:21:00.761\nBut I'll give you an example\nof one that's running and\n\n398\n00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:05.170\nit's absolutely unnecessary\nif you're not printing.\n\n399\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.180\nAll right, if I'm not printing, I don't\nneed the Print Spooler service running.\n\n400\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.980\nBut, you'll notice by default,\nthe start up type is automatic, right?\n\n401\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.630\nAnd if it’s automatic that means I’ve\ngot a service that could potentially\n\n402\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.550\nbe communicating with the network and\nI don’t really need it, right?\n\n403\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.300\nSo what I’d wanna do is, is I’d wanna come\nin here, first of all, stop the service.\n\n404\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.650\nFigure out if you need the service or\n\n405\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.470\nnot because there’s dependencies too, and\nin stopping one service, you might have\n\n406\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.970\ncrippled another one because it’s\ndependent on the one you stopped.\n\n407\n00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.300\nSo you gotta do your research, right?\n&gt;&gt; And often,\n\n408\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.690\nwon't they just tell you that?\n\n409\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.650\nThere'll be a pop-up that'll tell you,\nby disabling this service you could be\n\n410\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.230\naffecting other services?\n&gt;&gt; Well, sometimes it does and\n\n411\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.310\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n412\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.461\nBut I'll tell you Zach,\nanother way that you can do,\n\n413\n00:21:46.461 --> 00:21:50.736\nyou can actually go to a manufacturer's\nwebsite and they'll tell you,\n\n414\n00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:53.275\nhere is our ABCs of hardening your device.\n\n415\n00:21:53.275 --> 00:21:56.203\nAnd they tell you what services aren't\nneeded, or what to shut down, or\n\n416\n00:21:56.203 --> 00:21:57.020\nwhat to close down.\n\n417\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.420\nSo a lot of times the vendor or\nmanufacturer will have a best practices.\n\n418\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.420\nI know Windows has something known as\nthe Microsoft Security Baseline Analyzer.\n\n419\n00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.620\nAnd what it does is you run\nit across your server and\n\n420\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.130\nit'll say hey, you've got user accounts\nwith default passwords, right?\n\n421\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.300\nYou've got an administrative\naccount that's turned on and\n\n422\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.350\nnobody's using it, right?\n\n423\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.280\nSo, again, you have things\nwhere you can go to the vendor,\n\n424\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.340\nget the vendor-specific information.\n\n425\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.310\nCisco does this as well,\nJuniper does this, Windows, or\n\n426\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.740\nMicrosoft does this, Apple does it.\n\n427\n00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.421\nI mean, it's nothing that's specific\nto any one vendor except for\n\n428\n00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:33.250\nvendor-specific software right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n429\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.800\n&gt;&gt; All the vendors will do that so\n\n430\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.710\nI'm glad you asked that question, but you\ncan follow the security best practices for\n\n431\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.300\nwhatever the software or the device is,\nin this case we're talking more\n\n432\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.170\nof your devices right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n433\n00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.770\n&gt;&gt; So if it's a Cisco device that I'm\n\n434\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.900\nrunning, I'm gonna go up\nto Cisco's website and\n\n435\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.880\nCisco has a ton of thorough documentation,\nright?\n\n436\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.626\nA lot of documentation on how they would\nrecommend the starting process for\n\n437\n00:22:54.626 --> 00:22:56.706\nsecuring your devices, right?\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n438\n00:22:56.706 --> 00:22:58.744\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft does the same thing with\n\n439\n00:22:58.744 --> 00:22:59.810\nservers.\n\n440\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.363\nSo you wanna disable things\nlike unnecessary services,\n\n441\n00:23:02.363 --> 00:23:03.240\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n442\n00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.780\n&gt;&gt; That is important.\n\n443\n00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.740\nThe other thing that they\nwant you to understand too\n\n444\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.940\nis using secure protocols versus\nunsecure protocols, right?\n\n445\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.800\nWe talk about not using Telnet,\nright, why?\n\n446\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.110\nBecause it allows me a remote logon,\nthe remote log-on capabilities, but\n\n447\n00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.540\nit's clear text.\n\n448\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.889\nI don't want to be using Telnet.\n&gt;&gt; Human readable.\n\n449\n00:23:21.889 --> 00:23:22.492\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n450\n00:23:22.492 --> 00:23:25.527\nNot necessarily does it\nneed to be human readable,\n\n451\n00:23:25.527 --> 00:23:29.338\nif it's clear text you could put\nit in a piece of software that can\n\n452\n00:23:29.338 --> 00:23:30.124\nrebuild it.\n\n453\n00:23:30.124 --> 00:23:30.797\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n454\n00:23:30.797 --> 00:23:33.746\nUnlike cypher text which\nit doesn't matter,\n\n455\n00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.930\nyou can't understand what's going on,\nright?\n\n456\n00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.710\nSo we would be using something like\nSSH Rather than Telnet, right?\n\n457\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.600\nRather than using FTP,\nwhich is a clear text protocol,\n\n458\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.900\nwe would be using SFTP, right?\n\n459\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.780\nCoupling Secure Shell with FTP so\nyou can't see what's going on.\n\n460\n00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.338\nUsing HTTPS, secure HTTP,\nrather than HTTP, right?\n\n461\n00:23:54.338 --> 00:23:58.790\nIf you're using SNMP,\nyou're using SNMP version 3.\n\n462\n00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.105\nDefinitely not using version 1.\n\n463\n00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.970\nAnd very limited, maybe air gap networks.\n\n464\n00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.574\nMaybe SNMP 2, right?\n\n465\n00:24:04.574 --> 00:24:06.609\nBut you really should be using SNMP 3.\n\n466\n00:24:06.609 --> 00:24:12.060\nAgain, using those secure protocols\nover those insecure protocols.\n\n467\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.030\nLet's see the cool stuff,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n468\n00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.970\nSo, on my Windows machine.\n\n469\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:21.780\nWe've got Wireshark loaded up as a\nprotocol analyzer and let me go ahead and\n\n470\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.770\ndrop down to, I will drop down\na PowerShell here, all right.\n\n471\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.880\nAnd what I wanna do is\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n472\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.720\nI'm gonna open a Telnet session, right?\n\n473\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.780\nThis should be really,\nreally cool, all right?\n\n474\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:40.260\nSo I'm gonna open a Telnet session,\nand hopefully my server is responding,\n\n475\n00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.738\nwell this is gonna be\na very short demonstration.\n\n476\n00:24:42.738 --> 00:24:44.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.470\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna open it up\n\n478\n00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.650\nto our server.\n\n479\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.260\nNow notice what it tell,\nit's telling me right away,\n\n480\n00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.570\nyou're about to send your information to\na remote computer in the internet zone.\n\n481\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.380\nAnd it's not word wrapping,\nit says this might not be safe.\n\n482\n00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.278\nYou wanna do this?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n483\n00:24:56.278 --> 00:24:57.420\n&gt;&gt; Let's live dangerously.\n\n484\n00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.413\nLet's go ahead and do it.\n\n485\n00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:02.960\nAll right, so now I'm connected\nto my Telnet server, all right?\n\n486\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.093\nAnd I'm gonna run dir, I'm gonna run cd,\nI'm gonna look at this directory.\n\n487\n00:25:09.093 --> 00:25:11.380\nHey, you know what,\nI got a web server going.\n\n488\n00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.900\nSo let me go ahead and\nget into inetpub, all right.\n\n489\n00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.150\nLet me do dir here cuz I wanna see,\nokay, there is my ftp root, right?\n\n490\n00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.320\nSo I'm looking at stuff on the server,\nall right.\n\n491\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.070\nNow let's do the same thing.\n\n492\n00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.180\nWrite all of that.\n\n493\n00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.737\nLet me go ahead and quit.\n\n494\n00:25:27.737 --> 00:25:29.405\nYep, let me exit, right.\n\n495\n00:25:29.405 --> 00:25:35.070\nExit first, and press the any key,\nand then quit it.\n\n496\n00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.830\nAnd let's try that again so\nyou see what's going on.\n\n497\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.760\nBut this time, let's do a packet capture.\n\n498\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.738\nRight, and let me do a filter here\nthat says just my network adapter.\n\n499\n00:25:46.738 --> 00:25:49.860\nI don't wanna see all of the other stuff\nthat's going on, on the network, right?\n\n500\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.680\nLet's jump back to our Command Prompt,\nor Powershell in this case.\n\n501\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.860\nLet's fire up Telnet again.\n\n502\n00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.140\nLet's do an open, and\nwe'll go back to the same server.\n\n503\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.450\nAll right, and I'm gonna say yes.\n\n504\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.130\nAnd I'm gonna do those same commands.\n\n505\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.650\nLet's see.\n\n506\n00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.910\nI'm in the user profile here.\n\n507\n00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:07.920\nI'm gonna do a cd\\.\n\n508\n00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.020\nNow I'm on the root.\n\n509\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.614\nWe'll do a dir.\n\n510\n00:26:11.614 --> 00:26:19.155\nHey look, I could see my inetpub, there's\nmy location for IIS, my FTP directory.\n\n511\n00:26:19.155 --> 00:26:21.960\nSo we'll go ahead and move into that.\n\n512\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.550\nAnd I can do a dir there again as well.\n\n513\n00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.330\nMan, we've got some great\ninformation here, right?\n\n514\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.980\nIt's great I can do the remote log on.\n\n515\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:36.070\nLet's go over here to Wireshare and\nlet's stop this capture.\n\n516\n00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.480\nAnd what I'd like to do is notice\nthat in the protocol analyzer,\n\n517\n00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.530\nwe have Telnet data right here.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n518\n00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.180\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and let's right-click on\n\n519\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.745\nthat Telnet and\nlet's chose Follow &gt; TCP Stream.\n\n520\n00:26:51.745 --> 00:26:53.350\nAnd I want you to see something here.\n\n521\n00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.850\nIt knows in clear text\nthe name of the machine.\n\n522\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.560\nIt tells me exactly what I am typing.\n\n523\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.360\nTelnet open.\n\n524\n00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.795\nRemember the IP address.\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n525\n00:27:06.795 --> 00:27:09.335\n&gt;&gt; It tells me the user name that I logged\n\n526\n00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:13.545\nin as, and it shows me every\nsingle one of the commands that we\n\n527\n00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:14.665\njust did.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n528\n00:27:14.665 --> 00:27:16.005\nTelnet is a bad thing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:16.765\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n530\n00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:19.290\nYou need to stay away from Telnet.\n\n531\n00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.300\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n532\n00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.930\nAnd let's stop the capture.\n\n533\n00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.820\nWell, we already have.\n\n534\n00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.730\nLet's stop the capture.\n\n535\n00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.670\nAnd what I'll do is I'll go ahead and\nclose this down.\n\n536\n00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.530\nAnd we can close down Telnet too.\n\n537\n00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.300\nAnd I'm gonna fire up Putty.\n\n538\n00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.164\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna SSH into our sent box.\n\n539\n00:27:35.164 --> 00:27:36.280\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n540\n00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.840\nWe'll load this session.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n541\n00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.390\nI'm gonna start, and you know what?\n\n542\n00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.810\nLet me go ahead and\ncancel this just for a second.\n\n543\n00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.780\nI wanna do that same filter, cuz I\ndon't wanna get all the other traffic.\n\n544\n00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.853\nAnd we'll go ahead and continue without\nsaving and I'm gonna enter this filter.\n\n545\n00:27:54.853 --> 00:27:58.029\nI'm just looking at this network adapter,\nI don't wanna see everything else.\n\n546\n00:27:58.029 --> 00:28:01.406\nAnd what I'm gonna do is we'll go ahead\nand we'll open this session here, and\n\n547\n00:28:01.406 --> 00:28:04.545\nyou can see, boy that fired up in\nthe background, do you see that there?\n\n548\n00:28:04.545 --> 00:28:07.339\nAnd what we'll do is we'll,\nwell I am gonna type my username,\n\n549\n00:28:07.339 --> 00:28:08.800\nyou can see it here.\n\n550\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.111\nI'm gonna type my super-secret password,\nand I'm logged in, and\n\n551\n00:28:12.111 --> 00:28:15.380\nnow I'm gonna go ahead and\nlist the directory that I'm in, right?\n\n552\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.940\nSo just kind of manipulating around here,\nI'll do an ip adder.\n\n553\n00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.700\nI wanna see the information,\nwhat's the IP address?\n\n554\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.400\nAnd then what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna come over here, and\n\n555\n00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.400\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nstop the connection.\n\n556\n00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.010\nAll right, now remember,\nthis was SSH, right?\n\n557\n00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.160\nSo we started the TCP Stream here.\n\n558\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.170\nLet me go ahead and right-click and\nchoose follow here.\n\n559\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.540\nWhat I can see initially is\nthe SSH negotiation that says hey,\n\n560\n00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.890\nhere are the algorithms that we support.\n\n561\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.380\nBut what I want you to do is notice this.\n\n562\n00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.880\nIt's all jumbled up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n563\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.430\n&gt;&gt; It's encrypted information,\n\n564\n00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.610\nI can't tell what's going on here if\nI'm out there trying to eavesdrop on\n\n565\n00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.680\nyour information.\n&gt;&gt; And neither can bad actors.\n\n566\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.990\n&gt;&gt; And that's absolutely correct.\n\n567\n00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.170\nRight, those bad actors that\nwe have to worry about,\n\n568\n00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.790\nthings like malicious insiders,\nthings like the hackers, right?\n\n569\n00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.630\nWe don't have to, at least we have\na little bit more security, right?\n\n570\n00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.770\nSo that's you why you wanna use\nthings like secure protocols.\n\n571\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.280\nIt is very, very important.\n\n572\n00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.640\nLet me go ahead and\ndisconnect from my session here.\n\n573\n00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.730\nSo those are some of the things\nthat you need to worry about.\n\n574\n00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.050\nCouple of the other things too\nthat you need to worry about.\n\n575\n00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.570\nYou know we said unnecessary services?\n\n576\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.750\nTelnet is running on my machine,\non my server, right?\n\n577\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.348\nDisable things like ports, right?\n\n578\n00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:35.760\nWell remember that if you turn a service\noff and it uses a specific port,\n\n579\n00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.350\nessentially close the port down too.\n\n580\n00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.400\nThat's more of that device hardening.\n\n581\n00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:45.065\nSo for instance, IP ports, disable them,\nor session ports if you will.\n\n582\n00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:46.380\nYou're not using Telnet.\n\n583\n00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.470\nWe can disable port 23,\nand it doesn't matter.\n\n584\n00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.560\nIf somebody tries to\ntelnet into your device,\n\n585\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.560\nunless they try to change the port,\nit's not a one size fits all.\n\n586\n00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.680\nBut if you disable the service,\n\n587\n00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.980\nyou disable the port that's\nassociated with the service.\n\n588\n00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.540\nOr you can implement firewalls, and\nyou can specifically block the port.\n\n589\n00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.510\nAll right, let alone disable it.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n590\n00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.190\n&gt;&gt; But you also have device ports too,\n\n591\n00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.920\nphysical ports that we plug things to.\n\n592\n00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.700\nThat's where we implement things like\nport security where it says only this\n\n593\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.370\nMAC address can send information\ninto the access port on the switch.\n\n594\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.020\nRight, that's important, right.\n\n595\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.250\nDoing things like 802.1x where\nyou're using certificate,\n\n596\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.900\nyou're doing port based authentication.\n\n597\n00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.990\nClose down the port until\nyou're authenticated and\n\n598\n00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.110\nonce you're authenticated\nthen we open the port.\n\n599\n00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.210\nSo again, making sure that\nyou're disabling the ports.\n\n600\n00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:36.580\nAnd if you're not using the port,\njust disable it altogether or\n\n601\n00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.800\nturn the service on.\n\n602\n00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.190\nSo again you have software ports.\n\n603\n00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.760\nYou also have physical ports\nthat you need to keep in mind.\n\n604\n00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.660\nThese are some of the things that you need\nto be aware of when it comes to network\n\n605\n00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.440\ndevice hardening.\n\n606\n00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.628\nRemember, it's all about\nreducing that attack surface so\n\n607\n00:30:47.628 --> 00:30:50.710\nthat if somebody does try to\nmake their way onto your network\n\n608\n00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:54.770\nthrough your connectivity devices, you'll\ngive them a little bit harder of a time.\n\n609\n00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.780\nKeep these in mind when you\nsit that Net Plus Exam, so\n\n610\n00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.390\nyou'll be doing well.\n&gt;&gt; Well I feel more secure Wes,\n\n611\n00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.730\nthanks very much, you did a great job.\n\n612\n00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.930\nNetwork device hardening.\n\n613\n00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.810\nGreat episode.\n\n614\n00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.460\nIn fact, all of the episodes inside of the\naccelerated network series are fantastic.\n\n615\n00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.250\nWatch them all.\n\n616\n00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.480\nAnd you're in the course library,\n\n617\n00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.130\nthere's thousands of other videos there,\nthey're there to help you go further.\n\n618\n00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.060\nCheck them

00:00:12.981\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n4\n00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:16.380\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.107\nI'm your host Zack Memos as we\ncontinue one with Accelerated Net+.\n\n6\n00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:23.235\nCommon Mitigation Techniques\nis the title of this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.210\nand Wes Bryan is gonna show us the way.\n\n8\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.568\nWes, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back Zach.\n\n9\n00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:28.453\nThat's right,\n\n10\n00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:32.438\nwe're gonna look at ways that you can\ntry to mitigate, reduce if you will,\n\n11\n00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:36.950\nthe risk of successful attacks against\ndifferent components within your network.\n\n12\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.878\nSo remember mitigation is about not\nnecessarily eliminating all risk of\n\n13\n00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:45.834\nan exploitation, but it's,\nagain, just reducing it,\n\n14\n00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:49.529\nbringing it down to an acceptable level.\n&gt;&gt; Controlling it.\n\n15\n00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:50.933\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:55.124\nSo let's go ahead, and one of the first\nthings that we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n17\n00:00:55.124 --> 00:00:56.660\nkinda just do a quick review.\n\n18\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.420\nBecause one of the things that they\nmention is device hardening, and\n\n19\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.090\nif you haven't seen it we have\nan episode on network device hardening.\n\n20\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.910\nSo as a real quick recap here,\nwhat do we do?\n\n21\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.840\nChange default credentials,\nthat's important.\n\n22\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.418\nDefault credentials means somebody can\nessentially look at vendor documentation,\n\n23\n00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:18.103\nand if you haven't changed the defaults\non the device they're gonna\n\n24\n00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:20.690\nknow what your user name and password is.\n\n25\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.230\nAvoiding common passwords.\n\n26\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.365\nCommon passwords are ones that\ntypically are found in things\n\n27\n00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:31.875\nlike software that can help automate or\nassist the process of breaking passwords.\n\n28\n00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.275\nUpgrading your firmware,\n\n29\n00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:36.115\npatch management is another thing\nthat you need to keep in mind too.\n\n30\n00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:39.490\nDoing your updates,\nmaking sure that that's done.\n\n31\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.820\nDisabling unnecessary services, or ports.\n\n32\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.540\nUnused ports, close the port down,\nif that port is listening it is a point of\n\n33\n00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.230\nentre that somebody could exploit and\nmake their way into your systems.\n\n34\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.790\nUsing things like secure protocols.\n\n35\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.790\nDon't use HTTP when you\nshould be using HTTPS,\n\n36\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.194\ncertainly shouldn't be using Telnet,\nyou should be using SSH.\n\n37\n00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:03.293\nShouldn't be using SNMP version 1 at all,\n\n38\n00:02:03.293 --> 00:02:08.170\nrarely if anything SNMP version 2,\nyou should be using version 3.\n\n39\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.050\nThese are important, other things too.\n\n40\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.060\nDoing things like signature management,\nwe talk about signature management,\n\n41\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.830\nI want you to think of\nhow we identify viruses.\n\n42\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.945\nHow do we identify, and not just viruses\nbut malware in general, actually we used\n\n43\n00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:29.300\nto say anti-virus but today we have to say\nanti-malware cuz it's not just viruses.\n\n44\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.090\nViruses, if you're not aware,\n\n45\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.390\nremember a virus actually\nneeds a host to piggyback on.\n\n46\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.030\nBut we have other things that are not\nviruses, like for instance worms,\n\n47\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.230\na worm is a self-sufficient\nregenerating piece of code,\n\n48\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.812\nit doesn't need a host, it can sit\noutside of your device and wait for\n\n49\n00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:54.568\nthat port of entry, that's why you need to\ndisable that port if you're not using it.\n\n50\n00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:59.442\nLogic bombs, Trojans if you will,\nbotnets, all these things.\n\n51\n00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:03.316\nSo we need to make sure that we have\nproper signature management and\n\n52\n00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.289\nthat our signatures or\ndefinitions are up to date so\n\n53\n00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:11.287\nthat we're aware of common and popular,\nif you will, viruses within our networks.\n\n54\n00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:16.814\nThe other thing that we need to keep in\nmind too is changing our native VLAN,\n\n55\n00:03:16.814 --> 00:03:19.120\nand why would we wanna do that?\n\n56\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.360\nRemember your native VLAN,\nor the default VLAN,\n\n57\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.570\nthat is an untagged frame,\nand the problem is\n\n58\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.667\nis that somebody can\nmaliciously craft an 802.1q,\n\n59\n00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:38.453\nthe VLAN tagging protocol,\nsomebody can maliciously,\n\n60\n00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:42.490\nif I could say it,\nmaliciously craft one of those frames.\n\n61\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.980\nAnd what they can do is a VLAN\nhopping attack where they double tag,\n\n62\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.660\nthey put two of those 802.1q tags,\nthe one for\n\n63\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.740\nthe VLAN that the attacker is on and\nthen it removes that tag,\n\n64\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.690\nand if it remains untagged it gets dropped\nonto the native VLAN where all other\n\n65\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.630\ndevices that have untagged\nframes might be as well.\n\n66\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.713\nSo you wanna make sure that you're\nexplicitly tagging the native VLAN,\n\n67\n00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:11.630\nthat's one of the techniques to\nmitigating the threat of VLAN hopping\n\n68\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.067\nattacks through double tagging.\n\n69\n00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:17.321\nThe other thing that we need to keep in\nmind, too, is switch port configuration,\n\n70\n00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.341\nin fact we've got a list here of some\ndifferent switch port configuration,\n\n71\n00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:22.102\nwe're just gonna kinda run through these.\n\n72\n00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:26.925\nKeep in mind our full Net+ N10-007\ncourse because we kinda show you\n\n73\n00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:31.903\nsome demos of these as well, here in\naccelerator we're just gonna remember\n\n74\n00:04:31.903 --> 00:04:37.077\nthere is some assumed knowledge here,\nso we gonna just kinda talk about them.\n\n75\n00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:40.680\nPort security,\nwell what is port security for us?\n\n76\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.090\nBasically what it does is it\nallows us to restrict a port\n\n77\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.620\nto a particular MAC address,\n\n78\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.340\nthis can prevent basically rogue switches\nfrom being plugged into the networks,\n\n79\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.218\nvirtual machines if you will,\nrogue virtual machines out there too.\n\n80\n00:04:56.218 --> 00:05:01.540\nAnd it can also allows a limiting\nnumber of MAC addresses\n\n81\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.310\nthat can be used across a single port.\n\n82\n00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.470\nSo that's some of the things that\nyou can do with port security.\n\n83\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.443\nOther things we've talked about,\n802.1x, that port based authentication,\n\n84\n00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.422\nclosing down the port,\nnot allowing somebody on your network or\n\n85\n00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:16.970\ndevice on your network until they've\nauthenticated with a radius server.\n\n86\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.800\nSpanning Tree.\n\n87\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.730\nSpanning Tree is about flood protection,\nif somebody implements\n\n88\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.370\na broadcast storm on your\nnetwork what happens?\n\n89\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.950\nToo many broadcast communications\ngo across multiple switches that\n\n90\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.220\nare configured together and\nwhat happens is those\n\n91\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.020\nbasically causing those data link\nlayer to layer to switching loops.\n\n92\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.575\nSo Spanning Tree pretty much on a lot of\nyour switches is just enabled by default,\n\n93\n00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:52.795\nand what it does is the switches exchange,\nwhat's known as the bridge protocol\n\n94\n00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:57.775\nidentifier, BPDU if you will, and they go\nthrough a root bridge election process.\n\n95\n00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:02.200\nAnd it basically takes it and instead\nof creating this kind of mesh network,\n\n96\n00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.530\nwhat it does is it elects the root,\nand the root can forward.\n\n97\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.950\nAnd it also basically elects which ports\non a switch can actually be forwarding\n\n98\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.230\ninformation to other ports and\nwhich ports cannot,\n\n99\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.350\nbasically loops are detected and\nthen they're blocked automatically.\n\n100\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.050\nBut here's the problem,\nthere are some techniques in which\n\n101\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.640\npeople could try to maliciously\nattack Spanning Tree and\n\n102\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.270\ncause problems,\nthat's why we wanna protect Spanning Tree.\n\n103\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.754\nAnd one of the ways that we protect\nSpannning Tree is with something known as\n\n104\n00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:40.110\nBPDU Guard,\ndo you know what is it actually doing?\n\n105\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.340\nWell, BPDUs if you think about it,\nthat's what switches receive\n\n106\n00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.550\nwhen they're trying and what Spanning Tree\nprotocol uses to kinda go through\n\n107\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.800\nthis communication between switches\nto do root bridge election.\n\n108\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.554\nThe problem is,\nif somebody crafts a BPDU maliciously,\n\n109\n00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:05.670\nit can throw Spanning Tree off and it can\ngo through this recalculation process.\n\n110\n00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.955\nSo essentially what happens is BPDU Guard,\nit blocks\n\n111\n00:07:09.955 --> 00:07:14.835\nBPDUs on a specific port, and\ntypically it's used on access ports.\n\n112\n00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:19.545\nYou shouldn't hear bridge\nprotocol data units coming in on\n\n113\n00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:24.165\na port that a computer should be attached\nto, so we do this on access ports.\n\n114\n00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:28.405\nBut that's not the only way we\nwant to protect Spanning Tree,\n\n115\n00:07:28.405 --> 00:07:29.665\nwe also wanna protect the root.\n\n116\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.300\nSo in our list here when\nwe talk about Root Guard,\n\n117\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.320\nthis blocks the neighboring\nswitches from becoming the root.\n\n118\n00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.483\nViolations, if you will, will flag\nthe port as root inconsistent and\n\n119\n00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:47.028\nit closes this down so that we don't go,\nagain, throwing Spanning Tree off.\n\n120\n00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:50.228\nSo again, like I said,\nremember that BPDU Guard and Root Guard,\n\n121\n00:07:50.228 --> 00:07:53.930\nthese are the ways that we can\nhelp to protect Spanning Tree.\n\n122\n00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.434\nNow we also have Flood Guard, too.\n\n123\n00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.395\nA lot of times it's going to be\nconfigured alongside Port Security.\n\n124\n00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:03.003\nKeep in mind things like Cisco ASA\ndevices if you will, to give an example,\n\n125\n00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:05.940\nhave Flood Guard and\nthat's layer 3 and higher.\n\n126\n00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.790\nRemember that you also have Storm Control.\n\n127\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.090\nAgain, the same concept,\nwe wanna make sure that we don't get those\n\n128\n00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.170\nswitching loops, so at layer two, you have\non your Cisco catalyst devices switches,\n\n129\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.480\nyou have what is known as storm control.\n\n130\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.030\nAlright now, we also have what's known as\nthe the DHCP snooping, this is another\n\n131\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.060\nthing that we can use when it comes to\nswitch port protection and what this\n\n132\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.650\nessentially does is, it restricts\nunauthorized DHCP servers on the network.\n\n133\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.247\nAll right, it detects things like your\nDHCP offer packets, that are coming from\n\n134\n00:08:38.247 --> 00:08:43.270\na DHCP server in response to the discover\npacket, as part of th door process.\n\n135\n00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.460\nAnd what this does is, it says,\nI'm only gonna allow a DHCP offer\n\n136\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.040\ncoming from those trusted ports, right?\n\n137\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.930\nAnything else is gonna just be\nfiltered out or just be discarded.\n\n138\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.360\nSo, great thing to have access to as well.\n\n139\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.050\nNow, other things that we have\nto keep in mind likewise,\n\n140\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.080\nare things like for instance,\nhoney pot's and honey net's, all right?\n\n141\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.850\nSo, they call out a honey pot and a honey\nnet, what does this really mean for us?\n\n142\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.630\nSo all right, let me give you\nan example here, all right?\n\n143\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.200\nNotice that we have got the production\nnetwork here, we've got maybe a couple of\n\n144\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.000\nsites here, we've got a firewall,\nour gateway routers, right?\n\n145\n00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.490\nSo we got two different\nproduction networks, right?\n\n146\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.000\nAnd it could be a WAN environment, right?\n\n147\n00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.630\nWe have the DMZ, remember what the DMZ is,\nthat's the demilitarized zone.\n\n148\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.510\nIt's a screen subnet or\na perimeter network, right?\n\n149\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.595\nWhen we need to get public\naccess to one of our resources,\n\n150\n00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:36.280\nlike say a web server, right?\n\n151\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.430\nWe don't want to give somebody access\nto our internal network to gain\n\n152\n00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.410\naccess to the website.\n\n153\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.380\nSo what we do,\nis we put it in an edge network, right?\n\n154\n00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.890\nIn between two screening firewalls that\nallows public access to the web server but\n\n155\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.520\ndoesn't allow access into\nour private network, right?\n\n156\n00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.510\nNow, what's a Honeynet.\n\n157\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.768\nAll right, well, a Honeynet is actually\na fake if you will, a fake network or\n\n158\n00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:05.340\ndummy network and what this does, is we\nuse it for a couple of reasons, right?\n\n159\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.457\nWe use it to lure attackers on\nthe production network and make them think\n\n160\n00:10:09.457 --> 00:10:14.260\nthat what they're doing is that they're\nattacking one of our production networks\n\n161\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.990\nwhen really it's like a decoy, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n162\n00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.850\n&gt;&gt; The Honeynet,\n\n163\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.700\nif you will, is an entire decoy\nnetwork like this, right?\n\n164\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.610\nHowever, you also have what's\nknown as a Honeypot, right?\n\n165\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.700\nAnd a Honeypot is where,\nmaybe we make a fake DMZ, right?\n\n166\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.420\nIt's not the production DMZ,\nit's just a fake DMZ.\n\n167\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.310\nBut according to, what it looks like\nto the hacker, is it's really enticing,\n\n168\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.940\nit looks like any other public resource or\npublic basing resource.\n\n169\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.980\nAnd we put that web server,\nagain, that single resource,\n\n170\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.070\nthe honeypot not the entire network,\nthat's the honeynet, in that fake DMZ.\n\n171\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.900\nAnd then we just watch it,\nwe monitor not to lure them\n\n172\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.550\naway from a production network but\nalso to gain some insight,\n\n173\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.190\nsome infomration, what tactics are they\nusing in order to attack our networks.\n\n174\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.382\nSo we see what kind of tactics\nthey are using, then we know\n\n175\n00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:07.508\nwhat counter measures that we need to\nimplement to try to mitigate again,\n\n176\n00:11:07.508 --> 00:11:11.540\nthe risk of that attack being successful.\n&gt;&gt; Wes, does that use a lot of resources\n\n177\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.050\nto operate the honeynet honeypot?\n&gt;&gt; It can, it depends on the size,\n\n178\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.960\nif it's an entire network then you\nare gonna be using additional resources,\n\n179\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.710\nso, cost definitely comes into play here.\n\n180\n00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.050\nAnd one of the things that you can\nalso use is penetration testing.\n\n181\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.110\nI mean, that's a valid way to do it,\nright, basically testing system services,\n\n182\n00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.880\na resource if you will,\nmaybe an application for\n\n183\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.300\nthe purposes of trying to find\nthe vulnerabilities that it has and\n\n184\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.610\nif we can exploit those vulnerabilities,\nright?\n\n185\n00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.730\nUse a technique that says, hey,\nI found the vulnerabilities,\n\n186\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.170\nnow we're gonna go ahead and\nattack a system.\n\n187\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.730\nBut the difference here is, remember\nthe hackers or attackers if you will,\n\n188\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.560\nthey do it on their time, all right?\n\n189\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.391\nAnd you might not see it coming, right?\n\n190\n00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:53.876\nWith the penetration testing,\nwhat we're doing is, we're essentially\n\n191\n00:11:53.876 --> 00:11:57.600\ndoing it in a manner that which the\nprocess is thoroughly reviewed, all right?\n\n192\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.170\nWe know exactly what's going on,\nso it's also understood.\n\n193\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.370\nAnd then it's also authorized.\n\n194\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.025\nAnd not only authorized, so not only\nif you reviewing, understanding and\n\n195\n00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:09.760\nare authorizing it but we're also\nensuring that it's done in a safe manner,\n\n196\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.470\nso it doesn't bring down our\nproduction network, right?\n\n197\n00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.680\nSo it has to be performed\nin a safe manner.\n\n198\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.705\nAnd then this can allow us to know,\nalong with things like honeypots,\n\n199\n00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:23.040\nwhat vulnerabilities do we have,\nall right?\n\n200\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.370\nYou coupled that with\na honeynets if you will, and\n\n201\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.088\nthen we can see the techniques that they\nwould use as well, so it's a great way to\n\n202\n00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:33.070\nf find out what vulnerabilities\ndo you have within your networks.\n\n203\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.230\nAll right, so\nwe talked about the demilitarized zone,\n\n204\n00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.730\nthat's part of network segmentation.\n\n205\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.920\nThe other thing we can do with\n\n206\n00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.100\nnetwork segmentation is\nVirtual Local Area Networks, VLANs, right?\n\n207\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.950\nBasically taking a switch and\nlogically dividing it up and\n\n208\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.010\ntreating it like multiple switches.\n\n209\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.000\nAll right, and\nputting these computers on virtualized or\n\n210\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.270\nlogical instances of a local area network.\n\n211\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.480\nAnd we can isolate that communication,\nright?\n\n212\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.225\nWe can isolate things like broadcast\ncommunication that maybe we don't want\n\n213\n00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:02.980\neverybody to, all your computers to be\nable to see what's going on, right?\n\n214\n00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.498\nMaybe we got some production servers\nthat hold very sensitive data.\n\n215\n00:13:05.498 --> 00:13:10.140\nWell, we could put them on a VLAN, we can\nisolate them in their own broadcast domain\n\n216\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.890\nand that could help to make sure\nthat that traffic doesn't end up or\n\n217\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.530\nthose communications don't\nend up in the wrong hands.\n\n218\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.880\nAnd if we need VLANs to communicate,\nthat's where we can add the layer three\n\n219\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.940\nrouting technologies to allow them to\ncommunicate, if they truly need to, right?\n\n220\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.240\nSo also part of network segmentation, too.\n\n221\n00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.220\nOne of the other things that\nwe have to keep in mind too,\n\n222\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.722\nthey mentioned is privileged user account.\n\n223\n00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:32.702\nAll right, when we talked about\nprivileged user accounts,\n\n224\n00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:34.120\nall right,\nwhat accounts are we talking about?\n\n225\n00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.360\nA lot of the time we are talking\n\n226\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.290\nabout things like administrative accounts,\nright?\n\n227\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.930\nRoot users inside of mixed base systems.\n\n228\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.070\nYou have things like, for instance,\nthe Windows Systems Administrator,\n\n229\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.390\nthe default administrator if you will.\n\n230\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.940\nYou typically don't want\nto be using these accounts.\n\n231\n00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.050\nEven if it's not the default administrator\nin a Windows operating system.\n\n232\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.000\nWhether it's server or client,\nlet's take a domain administrator.\n\n233\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.219\nA lot of times, you'll have multiple\ndomain administrators and sometimes they\n\n234\n00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:01.310\ncan get a little lazy and what they can\ndo is they could share a single account.\n\n235\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.750\nAll right, well the problem is,\ndo you trust that person?\n\n236\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.180\nOkay, let's say you trust everybody\nin the company, well that's fine.\n\n237\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.920\nYou wanna be able to track their\nactivities, you wanna be able to do\n\n238\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.410\nauditing and then find out what\nactivities that they are performing?\n\n239\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.230\nWell, how can you tell?\n\n240\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.190\nLet's say if Zach and I are both the main\nadmins and we're both logging in using\n\n241\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.470\nthe same account,\nwe can't implement non repudiation.\n\n242\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.170\nI can say that wasn't me,\nthat was Zach that did it, all right?\n\n243\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.790\nYou're using a single account like that,\nespecially a privileged account, there's\n\n244\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.740\nno way to track who and hold somebody\naccountable for what's going on, right?\n\n245\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.010\nSo role separation.\n\n246\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.590\nYou got multiple domain admins,\n\n247\n00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.960\nyou have multiple domain\nadministrative accounts, right?\n\n248\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.320\nSo then we can track what's going on and\nwhen we do auditing, right,\n\n249\n00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.190\nand we review those logs, we can associate\n\n250\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:51.090\nan action against the system\nwith a specific person, right?\n\n251\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.540\nImplementing things like\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n252\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.710\nAll right, theres no reason, maybe if\nsomeone needs access to, I don't know,\n\n253\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.460\nlike an organizational unit\ninside the active directory.\n\n254\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.270\nWell, delegate administration\nof that owe you.\n\n255\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.860\nYou don't have to make them\ninto a domain admin and\n\n256\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.820\ngive them more privileges\nthan what they need, right?\n\n257\n00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:11.390\nJust reduce that down to\nan acceptable level of access,\n\n258\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.290\njust what they need to\nget their jobs done.\n\n259\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.410\nThings like, for instance,\nbackup users, right?\n\n260\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.340\nYou might have your backup operators and\n\n261\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.200\nyour people to do the restore\nof your sensitive information.\n\n262\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.510\nYou separate those as well.\n\n263\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.250\nRight?\n\n264\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.120\nIt's important.\n\n265\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.550\nThings like Key Recovery Agents.\n\n266\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.160\nRight?\n\n267\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.160\nKey Recovery Agents, I want you to think\nabout what a Key Recovery Agent or\n\n268\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.070\na KRA does.\n\n269\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.980\nAll right?\n\n270\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.440\nSo when you're using a PKI, right?\n\n271\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.920\nYou're using digital certificates.\n\n272\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.770\nRemember, we've talked about\nthe fact that certificates,\n\n273\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:41.130\npart of public e-infrastructure\nare basically take an entity and\n\n274\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.282\nassociate them with a public and\na private key.\n\n275\n00:15:44.282 --> 00:15:51.177\nAll right, remember if I use encryption\nand I encrypt information, if you will.\n\n276\n00:15:51.177 --> 00:15:53.589\nWhat's gonna happen is,\nif I lose that private key,\n\n277\n00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:56.700\nwhich usually does your decryption\nin a public key infrastructure,\n\n278\n00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.760\nif I lose that private key,\nI lose access to my information.\n\n279\n00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.577\nRight?\nIt's one of the reasons you don't delete\n\n280\n00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:03.167\nuser accounts, you just disable them.\n\n281\n00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:05.571\nBecause if they've got a certificate\nassociated with them and\n\n282\n00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:08.159\nthey've encrypted information\nwith that digital certificate and\n\n283\n00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:11.210\nyou delete the account,\nyou also delete the certificate.\n\n284\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.860\nThen you could lose access\nto that information.\n\n285\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.460\nSo what we do is we implement what's\nknow as a key recovery agent, all right?\n\n286\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.760\nAnd key recovery agents will have\nthe ability to restore the private key.\n\n287\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.290\nWhich means, let's say the CEO\nhas encrypted information,\n\n288\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.630\nsensitive information that nobody\nshould have other than the CEO, right?\n\n289\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.850\nWell, what if somebody's passed up for\na promotion and\n\n290\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:36.780\nthey're the key recovery agent?\n\n291\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.700\nWell, that information's encrypted, right?\n\n292\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.200\nAnd only the CEO should have the private\nkey that would encrypt that information.\n\n293\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.930\nBut what if the KRA is\na little disgruntled?\n\n294\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.520\nHe says, I'll just recover the private key\ncuz I have the privileges to do that, and\n\n295\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.770\nI'll go ahead and\ndecrypt all of the CEO's information, and\n\n296\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.145\nnow I have access to it, right?\n\n297\n00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:56.020\nThat's one of the reasons you have to\nensure things like a key recovery agent,\n\n298\n00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.550\nor a KRA, is in trusted hands,\nif you will.\n\n299\n00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.103\nIn fact here, let me show you.\n\n300\n00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:04.128\nYou can go a little bit farther than too,\nso\n\n301\n00:17:04.128 --> 00:17:07.330\nI'm actually in my\nWindows Server here too.\n\n302\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.980\nAnd it's actually running, well it's\nrunning a lot of things but more for\n\n303\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.440\nour purposes right now it's running\nActive Directory Certificate Services,\n\n304\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.240\nwhich is the way to implement a PKI inside\nof your Windows environments, right?\n\n305\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.599\nAnd if I go over to something like\nthe certificate authority, right?\n\n306\n00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.637\nThat's our certificate manager,\ncertificate authority manager,\n\n307\n00:17:24.637 --> 00:17:28.610\none of the things I can do is look at the\ncertificate templates that we have, right?\n\n308\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.139\nAnd there are a few, right?\n\n309\n00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:34.790\nThere's things like EFS Recovery Agent.\n\n310\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.758\nIf I have something that's encrypted,\nand this gets a little redundant with\n\n311\n00:17:37.758 --> 00:17:39.760\nthe encrypted file system, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.996\n&gt;&gt; That's also a user's identity\n\n313\n00:17:40.996 --> 00:17:43.750\nassociated with the product key that\ncould decrypt that information.\n\n314\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:49.140\nWell if I lose access to that private key\nor it's corrupted, I need the ability to\n\n315\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:54.344\nrecover the private key that will\ndecrypt that EFS encrypted information.\n\n316\n00:17:54.344 --> 00:17:56.940\nI know that's a lot of encrypted over and\nover [LAUGH] and over, right?\n\n317\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.611\nSo that's a very important role,\nneeds to be in trusted hands.\n\n318\n00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:02.255\nBut you can go even farther than that.\n\n319\n00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:07.060\nLike I said, you know if I go to our\ncertificate templates manager and\n\n320\n00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.610\nwe look down in here, yeah,\nthere should be a KRA here.\n\n321\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.230\nSo Key Recovery Agent's right there.\n\n322\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:18.350\nAnd if I was gonna issue the certificate,\nI might want to make sure that not any one\n\n323\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.720\nperson, you know, role separation's one of\nthe things that you, mitigation technique.\n\n324\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.520\nWell, I might say you know,\nbecause this role within our company is so\n\n325\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.640\nimportant, let's see, the issuance I\nbelieve, Issuance Requirements, all right?\n\n326\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.810\nNotice we're putting a CA\ncertificate manager approval.\n\n327\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.480\nThat's essentially saying that that\nmanager, oops, where did that go?\n\n328\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.370\nAll right, just disappeared,\nthere we go, sorry about that.\n\n329\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.759\nThat means that that\nmanager has to approve\n\n330\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.730\nthe key recovery agent certificate to\nbe issued out to an end user, right?\n\n331\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.620\nWhich is what you want.\n\n332\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.864\nBut what if the certificate\nmanager gets disgruntled?\n\n333\n00:18:55.864 --> 00:18:58.294\nWell now we've got both keys,\n\n334\n00:18:58.294 --> 00:19:04.290\nthe keys to the kingdom all in one\nperson's job role, if you will.\n\n335\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.850\nWell what if I say, hey, you know what?\n\n336\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.370\nI'm not gonna leave this to\nthe certificate manager approval.\n\n337\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.500\nOr maybe I do and I say, you know what?\n\n338\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.790\nThere's gotta be two\nadditional signatures.\n\n339\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.043\nNow we've got three people that all have\nto say yes before we can even issue this\n\n340\n00:19:18.043 --> 00:19:21.522\nand publish this certificate to\nwhere a KRA can then enroll it and\n\n341\n00:19:21.522 --> 00:19:25.170\nthen be issued that certificate\nto themselves, right?\n\n342\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.590\nSo again, you have a way to\nseparate those roles, right?\n\n343\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.810\nThat's roll separation.\n\n344\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.750\nYou want to make sure,\nI always say two keys on the launchpad,\n\n345\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.334\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\n\n346\n00:19:33.334 --> 00:19:34.391\nthen they can push the button.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n347\n00:19:34.391 --> 00:19:35.402\nthen they can push the button, right?\n\n348\n00:19:35.402 --> 00:19:39.663\nWe don't want any one person retaining\ntoo much power over some kind\n\n349\n00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:43.860\nof privileged user account or\nprivilege, privilege in general.\n\n350\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.770\nWhether, you know, whatever role might\nbe inside of your network, right?\n\n351\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.760\nSo data recovery agents,\nthere's a little bit of a difference here.\n\n352\n00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.481\nYou know, data recovery agents, you can\nactually restrict the level of access\n\n353\n00:19:55.481 --> 00:19:58.528\nthey have based on an ACL,\nan access control list.\n\n354\n00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:01.680\nAnd we can do this on switches,\nwe do this on firewalls as well,\n\n355\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.240\nyou know if you're on the list,\nif the rule's on the list.\n\n356\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.390\nWe look at the traffic that's the coming\ninto a switch or coming into a firewall.\n\n357\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.140\nIf it matches the rule,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n358\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.430\nWe either allow or deny it.\n\n359\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.860\nSo you have all different types,\naccess control lists,\n\n360\n00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.540\nanother basic ACL is your\npermissions list, right?\n\n361\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.780\nIf I look at the Security tab here, right?\n\n362\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.020\nSecurity tab says, hey,\nyou're an authenticated user?\n\n363\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.740\nWell, you've got read permissions, right?\n\n364\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.090\nYou can't actually enroll, right?\n\n365\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.040\nYou can't enroll, but notice by\nDomain Admins, domain admins can read,\n\n366\n00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.640\nwrite, and enroll.\n\n367\n00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.900\nEnterprise admins, well,\nthey can pretty much do the same thing.\n\n368\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.660\nBut notice that this is an access control\nlist, it uses essentially an identity.\n\n369\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.072\nAnd when that identity is confirmed or\nauthenticated,\n\n370\n00:20:46.072 --> 00:20:49.629\nit's then checked as to what level of\naccess you would have to something, right?\n\n371\n00:20:49.629 --> 00:20:51.270\nThen it's an access control list.\n\n372\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.850\nSo you can also use these too.\n\n373\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.568\nOther mitigation techniques too are things\nlike file integrity monitoring.\n\n374\n00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:01.340\nRemember, like we've talked\nabout in other episodes,\n\n375\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.546\none of the ways we monitor file integrity\nis through hashing algorithms, right?\n\n376\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.210\nI essentially take a set of data, a file\nif you will, run it through an algorithm,\n\n377\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.070\nproduces a fixed link value, and then we\nstore that fixed link value with the file,\n\n378\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.440\nall right?\n\n379\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.140\nIf I transfer that file, if I need to make\nsure that file hasn't been modified in any\n\n380\n00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.530\nway, whether it's network transmission\nerrors or malicious errors.\n\n381\n00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.080\nThen what I do is I take that file, and\n\n382\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.236\nbefore I even look at the value that\nwe've already got associated with it,\n\n383\n00:21:27.236 --> 00:21:29.860\nI run it through the same algorithm and\nI see what value I find.\n\n384\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.538\nThen we compare the two.\n\n385\n00:21:31.538 --> 00:21:34.060\nIf the two match,\nthe file hasn't been changed.\n\n386\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.250\nIf the file has changed,\nthen the values aren't gonna match and\n\n387\n00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.270\nwe can discard it or figure out what\nwe need to do from there, right?\n\n388\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.750\nSame thing happens with our frames and\nour FCSs, right?\n\n389\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.960\nYour switches if you will, they receive\na frame, they store it, they look at\n\n390\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.860\nthe frame checks in sequence, that\nlittle CRC 32 value, and at the frame.\n\n391\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.800\nThe CRC 32 value matches what\nthe switch finds when it produces or\n\n392\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.406\nperforms that cyclic redundancy check.\n\n393\n00:21:57.406 --> 00:21:58.930\nIf the two values match,\n\n394\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.090\nthe switch then forwards the frame\non to whatever the destination is.\n\n395\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.283\nIf they don't match, then it discards it,\nand there's a request for retransmission.\n\n396\n00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:11.630\nSo we use integrity monitoring in a lot\nof different things within our networks.\n\n397\n00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.850\nBut specifically when it comes to files,\n\n398\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.980\nreally the process really\nisn't too much different.\n\n399\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.150\nIt's just contingent on\nwhat algorithm you use,\n\n400\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.930\nbut the concept is absolutely the same.\n\n401\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.990\nThese are some of the things that you need\nto know when it comes to common mitigation\n\n402\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.980\ntechniques, and\nI know that we've thrown a lot at you.\n\n403\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.836\nKeep in mind, if you want a more\nin-depth approach to your NetPlus exam,\n\n404\n00:22:28.836 --> 00:22:31.090\ndefinitely check out our full course.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n405\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.890\n&gt;&gt;

learning.\n\n408\n00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.910\nAnd you should be doing good for\n\n409\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.560\nyour NetPlus Exam.\n&gt;&gt; Like Wes was saying, always be learning\n\n410\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.920\ncommon mitigation techniques, and that's\ninside the Accelerated NetPlus Series.\n\n411\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.785\nMake sure you watch\neverything in this series,\n\n412\n00:22:47.785 --> 00:22:49.750\nWes done a great job putting\nthis together for you.\n\n413\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.530\nAnd when you're in that course library,\nthere's hundreds and thousands in fact of\n\n414\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.010\nother videos, and they're all there to\nhelp you go further, so watch those too.\n\n415\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:01.000\nHey

00:00:13.009\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.060\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn, wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.810\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with Accelerated NetPlus.\n\n6\n00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.270\nOne of my favorite episodes with Wes\nis always working with hardware.\n\n7\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.320\nIt's a lot of fun, and\nin this episode will be no exception.\n\n8\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.890\nNetwork troubleshooting tools with\n\n9\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.273\nWes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:31.530\nHow we doing there?\nWe let the cat out of the bag.\n\n11\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.685\nThat's right, because we've talked a lot\nabout things like theory through our\n\n12\n00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:37.220\nAccelerated Net+, right?\n\n13\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.940\nWe talk about things like the OSI model,\nand well, let me tell you, isn't it nice\n\n14\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.270\nto just step away from theory and actually\nlook at something tangible, right?\n\n15\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.300\nSomething that you can actually\nget your hands on, right?\n\n16\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.680\nThey say hey,\nwhat does a packet look like?\n\n17\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.440\nWell, guess what,\n\n18\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.350\nwe're gonna actually show you what\na packet looks like here in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.300\nNow, I will say that Zach\nmentioned hardware tools, right?\n\n20\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.975\nWell, when the categories that we have,\nwhen it comes to the network\n\n21\n00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:03.310\ntroubleshooting tools, really, they\nkinda blow down to two different things.\n\n22\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.700\nHardware tools that we use for\n\n23\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.880\nthings like our physical medium,\ntesting our physical medium.\n\n24\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.730\nBut we also have software tools,\ntoo, that we have to keep in mind.\n\n25\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.210\nNow, I said two categories, right?\n\n26\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.360\nBut there's on the exam, if you're\nfollowing the objectives, there's actually\n\n27\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.970\nthree categories, cuz they put a third one\nin there that's called command line tools.\n\n28\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.840\nWell, I'm of the mindset that a command\nline tool, for classification, okay,\n\n29\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.600\nit is a command, but\n\n30\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.825\nthey're essentially utilities that are\nrunning in software likewise, too, right?\n\n31\n00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:32.155\nSo they kind of are in\nthe software likewise.\n\n32\n00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:36.301\nBut again, some of these are built into\nthe operating system, versus things like\n\n33\n00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.275\nthird-party tools that, software-based\ntools, that we'll be looking at.\n\n34\n00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.885\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive right in.\n\n35\n00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:47.450\nA couple of the tools that we have,\nthey're kind of expensive.\n\n36\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.010\nSo they're not relatively easy to show\nunless you've got several thousands of\n\n37\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.150\ndollars to spend in order\nto get these utilities.\n\n38\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.490\nSo we're actually gonna go to our\ncomputer here and, wouldn't you know it,\n\n39\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.470\nlike always,\nI have stole Zach's credit card here.\n\n40\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.940\nAnd one of the first ones I wanna talk\nabout is what is known as an OTDR.\n\n41\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.880\nThe OTDR is the optical\ntime-domain reflectometer,\n\n42\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.980\nright?\n&gt;&gt; I needed one of those, that's great!\n\n43\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, that's good.\n\n44\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.940\nBecause if we look at the prices here,\n\n45\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.630\nhe's gonna change his mind here\nin a second, I can tell you that.\n\n46\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.140\nBecause if you look,\nyou'll see why I said that you can't,\n\n47\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.190\nto purchase these,\nlike here's a cheaper one.\n\n48\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.660\nTen grand, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.854\nSo they can get very, very expensive.\n\n50\n00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:32.490\nSo you can see that Zach is no longer\nsaying he needs one of those anymore,\n\n51\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.618\nright?\n&gt;&gt; I'll use the old one!\n\n52\n00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:35.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll use the discount price, and\n\n53\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.860\nyou can see, yes,\nthey do come down in price.\n\n54\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.820\nThey're not all $10,000.\n\n55\n00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.394\nBut you can see that some of these\noptical time-domain reflectometers,\n\n56\n00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:47.950\nif I go high to low, well,\nhere we've got one for Fluke.\n\n57\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.750\nIt's $40,000.\n\n58\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.500\nSo you can have a network testing tool or\nyou can have Denali.\n\n59\n00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.980\nIt depends on which one you want.\n\n60\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.870\nBut what are these for, right?\n\n61\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.000\nWell, they do things like,\nyou can see, for\n\n62\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.160\ninstance, certifying our cables, right?\n\n63\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.330\nOne of the things that a time-domain\nrefractometer does is it tests\n\n64\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.180\nthe optical light, if you will,\ninside of a fiber optic cable.\n\n65\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.587\nWhether it's running in multi-mode,\nMMF or SMF, single mode fiber, right?\n\n66\n00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:16.022\nWhether we're talking\nabout 9 micron cable, or\n\n67\n00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:21.592\nwe're talking about a 62.5 or\nthe 50 micron variety in multi-mode.\n\n68\n00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:24.400\nAnd why would I need something that's so\nexpensive?\n\n69\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.510\nWell, personally I wouldn't\nunless Zach's paying for it.\n\n70\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.150\nBut I will tell you that\nif you're an ISP and\n\n71\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.830\nyou're providing service level agreements,\nyou've got a bunch of customers,\n\n72\n00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.450\nyou're definitely going to\nneed one of these, right?\n\n73\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.380\nBecause proverbially that's your bread and\nbutter, right, when it comes down to it.\n\n74\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.780\nSo a lot of times, you'll see that these\nare a very expensive tools that a lot of\n\n75\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.350\ntimes will be used by things like the\nTelcos or the telecommunication providers.\n\n76\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.530\n&gt;&gt; And we're not promoting Fluke or\n\n77\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.340\nanything, but\nmy brother-in-law who happens to work for,\n\n78\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.320\nI think I can probably say this,\n\n79\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.340\nCox Communications, they use Fluke.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Fluke is one of the best.\n\n80\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.080\nAnd again, not promoting it, but if you've\ngot good quality, you've got good quality.\n\n81\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.400\nAnd Fluke is one of the best networking\ncable tool manufacturers out there.\n\n82\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.050\nAnd you'll see that their name pops up in\na lot of the different tools that we have.\n\n83\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.570\nSo think about this.\n\n84\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.480\nIf you've got a cable that\nruns 40 kilometers, yeah,\n\n85\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.420\nthat's right, 40,000 meters, right, and\nyou got a tin based Cable that's running\n\n86\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.180\nover single mode fiber and\nit runs 40,000 meters, right?\n\n87\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.730\nHow do you test that, right?\n\n88\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.210\nYou also have to keep in mind things like,\nfor instance, light loss,\n\n89\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.370\nit could be light loss due to\nthings like bends in the cable.\n\n90\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.990\nWell, you can't bend a cable too much or\n\n91\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.510\nthe problem is you're gonna start\ngetting signal reflection, right?\n\n92\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.540\nThat's why they have a bend\nradius protectors, if you will,\n\n93\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.400\ninside of your server closets\nthat makes sure that the radius\n\n94\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.850\nnever goes farther than what it needs,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.680\nIs there a break in the cable?\n\n96\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.780\nThat's what are these OTDRs can do, right,\nthe optical time-domain reflectometers.\n\n97\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.820\nAgain, very expensive here, but it is\nsomething you should know for the exam.\n\n98\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.910\nNow, another utility that, or\ntool, hardware based tool,\n\n99\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.290\nthat is also very expensive is what\nis known is a spectrum analyzer.\n\n100\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.470\nAnd a spectrum analyzer, as you could see\nhere, they can get very expensive, too.\n\n101\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.070\nYou can see this one here,\nit's not cheap by any means.\n\n102\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.225\nBut even cheap is $900, right?\n\n103\n00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:19.636\nAnd again, if we kinda sort this high\nto low, you can see, well, there's one\n\n104\n00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:22.520\nrefurbished, used at $120,000, right?\n&gt;&gt; I'll\n\n105\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.310\ntake three.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n106\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.459\nwe're talking about a second mortgage\non the house, [LAUGH] right?\n\n107\n00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.170\nSo again, if you're a telecommunications\nprovider, if you build\n\n108\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.670\nwireless networks and you need to know\nthe entire electromagnetic spectrum for\n\n109\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.580\ndesigning, as an architect, building\nthese wireless networks, and you work for\n\n110\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.320\na large company, then you're\ndefinitely gonna have one these.\n\n111\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.130\nAnd again, you can see,\neven if we just do the default here,\n\n112\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.040\nthey certainly don't have\nto be that crazy expensive.\n\n113\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.440\nHere is one that's a little bit cheaper.\n\n114\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.680\nAnd again, $900.\n\n115\n00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.990\nSo again, you can see that these\nare relatively expensive devices\n\n116\n00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.680\nthat you should be aware.\n\n117\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.869\nRemember, the spectrum analyzer,\n\n118\n00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.475\nit analyzes the entire\nelectromagnetic spectrum, right?\n\n119\n00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:09.778\nSo it's very good for\nyour wireless communications and\n\n120\n00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:12.729\nlooking at why you might\nget a signal reflection,\n\n121\n00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.820\nwhy you might get a attenuation\nwithin you wireless networks, too.\n\n122\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.640\nSo, great thing to have if you are a\nwireless network architect or work for\n\n123\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.780\na company that builds and supports and\ndoes consultation for that kind of work.\n\n124\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.670\nNow, there is another thing\nspeaking of fiber, right,\n\n125\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.940\nthere is another tool that they call out.\n\n126\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.685\nAnd again,\n\n127\n00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:39.670\nCompTia does a really good job trying to\nbe as vendor neutral as they possibly can.\n\n128\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.990\nHowever, there are all certain\ntechnologies, as we know,\n\n129\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.310\nthat are made by vendors because they\nkind of revolutionized the industry.\n\n130\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.940\nWell, in that vendor neutrality,\nsometimes you get more generic names.\n\n131\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.790\nAnd it might not be something that if you\nlook for, you're like, I can't find it.\n\n132\n00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.246\nAnd that's a light meter, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:57.246 --> 00:07:04.510\nA light meter's actually a fiber optic,\nhardware diagnostic tool, if you will.\n\n134\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.370\nAnd in fact, I'll go ahead and\nshow you here.\n\n135\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.770\nSo If I do, let's say fiber,\n\n136\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.930\nyou can see it come up in the search\nengine here, I've already searched for it.\n\n137\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.700\nLight meter, and\nwe go shopping again here.\n\n138\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.010\nNotice that it doesn't\nsay light meter here.\n\n139\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.540\nNotice that I see optical power meter.\n\n140\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.790\nWell, think about what the source\nis in an optical cable.\n\n141\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.790\nIt's a light source, right?\n\n142\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.990\nThe stronger the signal,\nthe more power that signal has, right?\n\n143\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.660\nThe greater the strength of the signal.\n\n144\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.679\nSo, if you do, notice I put fiber light\nmeter, and you look at power meter,\n\n145\n00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:44.090\nwe're pretty much talking about\na synonymous term here, right?\n\n146\n00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.106\nIt measures the light strength,\nthe signal strength,\n\n147\n00:07:47.106 --> 00:07:48.977\ninside of that fiber optic cable.\n\n148\n00:07:48.977 --> 00:07:51.930\nAnd that is one that\nyou should be aware of.\n\n149\n00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.620\nNow, those are some of the utilities\nthat we definitely need to talk about.\n\n150\n00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.000\nThere are a couple more that I\nwould want you to be aware of.\n\n151\n00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.270\nThere's also what's known\nas a loop back adapter.\n\n152\n00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.470\nYou've seen where we've talked about\npinging the loop back adapter.\n\n153\n00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.940\nWell, that's actually a software adapter.\n\n154\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.571\nThey call that a pseudo-adapter.\n\n155\n00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:08.736\nIt's kinda like an adapter, only not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:09.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n157\n00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:12.970\nwell the adapter is one that we\nuse to test the software within\n\n158\n00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.232\nour operating systems\ntrying to find out hey,\n\n159\n00:08:15.232 --> 00:08:19.234\nwell do they actually speak the protocol\nof the network, right, do they speak and\n\n160\n00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:21.670\nunderstand the TCP/IP protocol stack,\nright.\n\n161\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.080\nSo when we ping the loopback\nadapter what we're doing is that,\n\n162\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.180\nthey call it a loopback adapter actually\nbecause if you think about the OSI model,\n\n163\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.270\nour seven layer modeled system,\nit actually brings that communication from\n\n164\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.330\nthe application layer down to\nthe network layer, tests the IP,\n\n165\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.550\nand then loops it back up to the\napplication layer and we get the output.\n\n166\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.780\nBut nothing ever tests the electrical\ncapabilities of the network adapter,\n\n167\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.680\nright, we're not actually sending\nan electrical communication or even\n\n168\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.550\na wireless communication for that matter\nout the network adapter, right, the NIC.\n\n169\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.280\nSo how do I bring this down\na little bit farther and\n\n170\n00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.410\nactually test the data link layer and\nthe physical layer, right.\n\n171\n00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.020\nThe data link layer is MAC addresses,\nswitching technologies, right if you will.\n\n172\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.440\nOr even more so, how do I test\nthe electrical capabilities of the network\n\n173\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.246\nadapter to send and receives signal?\n\n174\n00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:11.588\nWell you can use what's known as\na physical loopback adapter, and\n\n175\n00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:15.836\nreally the only difference between that\nis the fact that it's a little RJ45 jack.\n\n176\n00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:18.244\nAnd you can actually make these,\nit's kinda cool,\n\n177\n00:09:18.244 --> 00:09:21.910\nif you just take the transmit pins and you\ncross them over to receive pins with two\n\n178\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.194\nwires you've made a loopback adapter,\nright.\n\n179\n00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:28.776\nIf you think about your wiring schematics\nthat we've talked about, 568A and\n\n180\n00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:33.760\n568B, remember we talk about that there\nare two transmit pins, pins one and\n\n181\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.240\ntwo, positions one and two, if you will.\n\n182\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.190\nAnd then there are two receive pins,\nright, and\n\n183\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.170\nthat's positions, or pins, three and six.\n\n184\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.090\nWell if I kinda take that RJ45 jack and\n\n185\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:51.220\nI send two pairs of wires out\nthe transmit pins on that RJ45 jack and\n\n186\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.380\nI loop them right back into pins\nin positions three and six.\n\n187\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.022\nThen notice what I'm doing is creating\nthat loopback, it's sending information\n\n188\n00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:04.414\nout and then looping it right back into\nthe recipient pins on that RJ45 jack.\n\n189\n00:10:04.414 --> 00:10:08.110\nOnce I've made that I plug it into\na network adapter and I do a ping,\n\n190\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.400\nit's going to send an electrical\ncommunication out that network adapter and\n\n191\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.854\nit's gonna loop it back.\n\n192\n00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:18.032\nSo it actually gives us the ability to\ntest the physical characteristics of\n\n193\n00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:21.749\nthe network adapter,\nunlike the software loopback adapter which\n\n194\n00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:26.500\nis really just again testing software,\nso definitely know that one as well.\n\n195\n00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.460\nNow we've also got some that we do have\nhere handy because we use them all\n\n196\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.920\nthe time, let's go ahead and\ncheck these out.\n\n197\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.270\nYou'll see that we've got\na few different types here.\n\n198\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.620\nWhat we have is, this is what's\nknown as a cable crimper, right,\n\n199\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.530\nthey just generically say crimper.\n\n200\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.610\nClimb Tools,\nthat's another very good one, and\n\n201\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.390\nagain we're not getting\nany endorsement here,\n\n202\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.580\nbut again if they make a good product\nit's really good to know, right.\n\n203\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.850\nSo what this does, is this allows\nyou to strip a cable, right,\n\n204\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.880\nyou can see that it's kinda shaped\nalmost like a little circle there and\n\n205\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.940\nthat allows me to strip the cable and\npull the outer sheathing off.\n\n206\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.941\nAnd then I also got\nthe little wire clip here, or\n\n207\n00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:05.785\nwire cutter right,\nwe can actually trim the wires off here.\n\n208\n00:11:05.785 --> 00:11:09.466\nAnd what this also allows me to do is,\nI went ahead and\n\n209\n00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:13.987\nput this together beforehand,\nis once you have your CAT cable,\n\n210\n00:11:13.987 --> 00:11:20.015\nyour wires arranged in whatever the wiring\nspecification is that you're gonna use,\n\n211\n00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:22.545\nwhether it's 568A or 568B.\n\n212\n00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:26.992\nThen what you can do, arrange that, then\nyou can put your RJ45 jack on this, and\n\n213\n00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:31.000\nthis one isn't attached, right,\nI can actually move that off of there.\n\n214\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.800\nI don't know if you can see that moving,\nI wanted to show you guys and gals there.\n\n215\n00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.280\nThen what I can do is I can\ntake the cable crimper, and\n\n216\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.980\nI put this in here into the cable\ncrimper and I crimp it down, right.\n\n217\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.396\nNow as I do this I wanna stop halfway and\nI wanna show you what's kind of cool,\n\n218\n00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:49.471\nnotice I can't open this, right.\n\n219\n00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:52.819\nNow I could if I do the release lock, but\none of the things that's nice about these\n\n220\n00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:56.414\ncable crimpers is the reason it's in this\nlocked position is it's saying you haven't\n\n221\n00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:58.877\nfully crimped it yet,\nwell it's not really saying that but\n\n222\n00:11:58.877 --> 00:12:01.660\nthat's how they designed it,\nyou haven't fully crimped it yet.\n\n223\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:07.358\nSo what's happening is it's pressing down\nthe copper conductors in the RJ45 jack,\n\n224\n00:12:07.358 --> 00:12:12.277\nand they're piercing the outer coating\nof the internal twisted pairs that\n\n225\n00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:13.540\nwe've arranged.\n\n226\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.610\nAnd when we crimp it all the way down\nit actually makes a physical contact\n\n227\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.730\ninto the conductors within the wire, and\n\n228\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.390\nthen what we should see here\nis that it releases, right.\n\n229\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.930\nAnd when it releases, what we have here\nis a fully crimped RJ45 jack that we\n\n230\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.620\ncan turn around, and we can plug into the\nport on the network adapter and we don't\n\n231\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.800\nhave to worry about it falling out, by\nany means, and we've terminated that end.\n\n232\n00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.616\nNow we also have other tools here.\n\n233\n00:12:40.616 --> 00:12:42.258\nSo that's our cable crimper, right,\n\n234\n00:12:42.258 --> 00:12:44.565\nbut we also have what's\nknown as a punch-down block.\n\n235\n00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:48.814\nAnd punch-down blocks,\nthey're used on your 66 blocks,\n\n236\n00:12:48.814 --> 00:12:52.327\nyour 110 blocks, right,\nthat we talk about for\n\n237\n00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:57.658\nterminating things like telephony-based\nsystems on those blocks as well.\n\n238\n00:12:57.658 --> 00:13:02.265\nBut sometimes you also need to\nhardwire your CAT cables, right,\n\n239\n00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:06.704\nnot everything has a nice little\nport like this where we can just\n\n240\n00:13:06.704 --> 00:13:09.920\nuse an RJ45 jack and\nwe can plug in, right.\n\n241\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.560\nSo what a punch-down tool does, all right,\nis if I take this off you're gonna see\n\n242\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.740\nthat it actually has a little u gouge\nright there if you'll notice here,\n\n243\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.565\nthere we go you get a little\nbit of contrast there so\n\n244\n00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:21.780\nyou can see it, a little u gouge, right.\n\n245\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.370\nAnd then notice that we've got a blade\nright here and you gotta be careful,\n\n246\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.280\nif you can see right there,\nZach can you see that,\n\n247\n00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.540\nthat scissors right there?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n248\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.910\n&gt;&gt; What that lets me know is that in\n\n249\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.100\nthe up position here\nthe scissors right there,\n\n250\n00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.940\nthat's gonna trim the excess off,\nright, well what do I mean by that?\n\n251\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.570\nWell sometimes you need\nto hardwire a cable into,\n\n252\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.720\nwhether it be a punch-down block, or\nwhether it be on the back of a patch\n\n253\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.730\npanel, in this case you might see,\nthis just happens to be a coupler.\n\n254\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.730\nBut if this was a wall plate your\nstructured wire comes down through\n\n255\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.652\nthe wall itself, and then it's just when\nthe wiring is just sitting right there.\n\n256\n00:13:58.652 --> 00:14:02.260\nAnd then what you need to do is\nyou need to hardwire the faceplate\n\n257\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.490\ninto the actual cable so\nthat you can then turn around and\n\n258\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.380\nyou can use this just like\nany other connection, right.\n\n259\n00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.660\nBut we need to hardwire that,\nand what the punch-down tool does\n\n260\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.750\nis this allows me the ability,\nI have to look to the back of it and\n\n261\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.230\nit will typically have what\nyour color arrangement is,\n\n262\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.380\nwhether it's a patch panel on a server\nclause on our faceplate, and it lets\n\n263\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.330\nyou know whether you're doing 568A or\n568B, that's what these color schemes are.\n\n264\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.990\nSo once you know that, what your\nscheme is, what you do is you just\n\n265\n00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.380\nplace your wire right here,\nright, and you have to make sure,\n\n266\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.190\nnotice the cutting edge and they're here,\nnotice the cutting edge where that is.\n\n267\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.900\nAnd the reason I have\nthe cutting edge facing this way\n\n268\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.515\nis because what the punch-down tool does,\nyou'll notice is that it embeds.\n\n269\n00:14:44.515 --> 00:14:49.299\n[NOISE] And\nyou can hear the click right there, right?\n\n270\n00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:54.213\nWell, what you'll notice here is\nnotice there's still some excess here,\n\n271\n00:14:54.213 --> 00:14:57.800\nright, well that scissor\ntrims the excess off too.\n\n272\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.680\nSo what it does is it embeds the wire,\n\n273\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.460\nit strips the wire, and you don't really\nneed to strip the wire cuz it actually\n\n274\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.420\nmakes an electrical contact when it\nembeds, but then it trims off the excess.\n\n275\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.920\nNow you do have to be careful,\nlet me show you [LAUGH] a mistake\n\n276\n00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.370\nthat I made too that can lead\nyou into some network issues.\n\n277\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.580\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'll punch\n\n278\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.120\nthis down to the blue conductor here.\n\n279\n00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.910\nBut be careful, there's a reason they put\n\n280\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:34.120\nthe scissor icon there to let you know\nwhich way, because if I put the scissor\n\n281\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.100\nicon now going back towards the conductor\nI wanted to show you what happens.\n\n282\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.700\nWell unfortunately what I did was\nI embedded it, and unfortunately\n\n283\n00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.570\nnow I've cut the wrong side of the cable\noff, and I've actually done that.\n\n284\n00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.020\nSo punch-down blocks are very, very cool,\npunch-down tools, excuse me, for\n\n285\n00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.820\npunch-down blocks, right, and\nthey don't have to be the blocks\n\n286\n00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.970\nthat you would see on the back\nof your patch panels.\n\n287\n00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.018\nNow I will tell you that in some of these\nthey've kinda got a way, not every one,\n\n288\n00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:02.919\nbut some of these they've\nactually kind of got a way, and\n\n289\n00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:06.968\nwhat you'll see is on the back of the\npatch panel you'll also see another RJ45\n\n290\n00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:10.190\njack where you can just use Cables\nthat are already prefabbed.\n\n291\n00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.550\nYou don't have to do the fabrication\nof them and then hardwire them.\n\n292\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.640\nSo that's your punch down tool, and again,\nit's used with things like your 66 and\n\n293\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.220\n110 blocks.\n\n294\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.165\nI know 66 block's kind of a thing of\nthe past, but they still use 110 blocks.\n\n295\n00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:25.425\nNow the next thing we have\nis this guy here, right.\n\n296\n00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:29.125\nNow this is what's known as, you can\nsee generically, this one's just called\n\n297\n00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:31.575\na Wire Tracker, and there's a trademark so\nit's a specific name.\n\n298\n00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:36.085\nBut generically we have what's known\nas a toner probe and a tone locator.\n\n299\n00:16:36.085 --> 00:16:40.248\nAll right, now the toner probe,\nor tone generator, excuse me.\n\n300\n00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:45.225\nTone generator and toner probe, all right,\nsometimes called the fox and the hound,\n\n301\n00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:47.310\nit helps me to trace a wire, right.\n\n302\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.647\nWhen I have a bundle of CAT cables\ncoming out of a server closet, and\n\n303\n00:16:51.647 --> 00:16:56.080\nthere's 3, 4, 500 of them, and\nI'm looking for one cable.\n\n304\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.850\nHow can I tell which cable it is,\nif i plug it into a port, let's say,\n\n305\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.704\nin a wall in another\nplace in the building.\n\n306\n00:17:02.704 --> 00:17:08.580\nWell, what you can do is, you can\nactually plug this side into the port,\n\n307\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.560\nand then you can go over to the server\ncloset, and you turn your toner probe on.\n\n308\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.929\nAll right, this is the tone generator,\nyou turn you toner probe on, and\n\n309\n00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:20.036\nthen what you can do is just touch\nit to the various cables, right.\n\n310\n00:17:20.036 --> 00:17:23.500\nAnd what'll happen is, when it is\nturned on, and we'll go ahead and\n\n311\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.050\nturn this one on here.\n\n312\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:29.120\nIt will make, and let me go ahead and\nmake sure that that is on.\n\n313\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.994\nAll right, it should, if I can,\nlet me make sure that this is on.\n\n314\n00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.020\nAnd one moment here,\nI want to make sure that.\n\n315\n00:17:45.782 --> 00:17:48.806\nIt's not transmitting,\nI gotta make sure it is transmitting.\n\n316\n00:17:53.059 --> 00:17:58.207\nThere we go, let's see if we can get.\n\n317\n00:17:58.207 --> 00:18:01.218\n[SOUND] Now if you can hear that,\nwhat it's doing is,\n\n318\n00:18:01.218 --> 00:18:03.900\nit's letting me know\nthat it found the cable.\n\n319\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.016\nIn this case, it is the cable cuz it's\ncoming right out of the tone generator.\n\n320\n00:18:08.016 --> 00:18:08.860\n&gt;&gt; It found itself.\n\n321\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.471\n&gt;&gt; But if I had plugged this into a drop\n\n322\n00:18:11.471 --> 00:18:16.337\ncable and touched the actual cable\nin the server closet that this\n\n323\n00:18:16.337 --> 00:18:20.290\nport would be plugged\ninto the associated port.\n\n324\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:25.350\nWhat this generator is doing is it's\ntransmitting a small electrical signal\n\n325\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.290\ndown the cable.\n\n326\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.004\nThat when you touch the cable,\nagain, what happens is.\n\n327\n00:18:30.004 --> 00:18:33.160\n[SOUND] If you can hear that\nlittle sound there, right?\n\n328\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.520\nSo that's why they call it a tone\ngenerator and a toner probe, right?\n\n329\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.970\nIt gives you the ability to trace or\nin this case track where a wire is.\n\n330\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.050\nNow, another thing that we have too\nis what is known as a cable tester.\n\n331\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.710\nNow, cable tester is exactly\nwhat it sounds like, and\n\n332\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.176\nthere are many different kinds.\n\n333\n00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:53.376\nThere's also cable and\ncertifiers, what they do is,\n\n334\n00:18:53.376 --> 00:18:58.120\nthey verify that if you've put a CAT6\ncable in and it you need a 10 gig network.\n\n335\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.498\nIt doesn't t tolerate a lot of\nelectromagnetic interference or\n\n336\n00:19:02.498 --> 00:19:04.452\na subpar cable, all right.\n\n337\n00:19:04.452 --> 00:19:07.430\nThis isn't a certifier,\nall this does is make sure and\n\n338\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.450\nverifies that if I plug two ends of,\nfor instance, a CAT cable here.\n\n339\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.810\nIt's gonna send a signal down,\n\n340\n00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.220\nand it's gonna verify that all\nthe conductors are wired appropriately.\n\n341\n00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.830\nAnd it'll tell me, is there a short in the\ncable, or is there some kind of reversal?\n\n342\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.780\nNow be careful,\nbecause this will also detect, and\n\n343\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.490\nit's not gonna be an error like this,\nall right?\n\n344\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.090\nIt will also detect a crossover cable,\ntoo.\n\n345\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.310\nIt won't throw an error,\nit'll throw the green light.\n\n346\n00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.480\nAnd I know that doesn't quite look\ngreen there, but green lights, right?\n\n347\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.730\nA reversal is when you don't\nhave a crossover cable, and\n\n348\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.970\nyou don't have straight through cable,\nsomebody made it wrong, right?\n\n349\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.900\nA short is obviously exactly what\nit sounds like, short in cable,\n\n350\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.950\nsome type of damaged cable.\n\n351\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.590\nAnd that's what it is there to do for you.\n\n352\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.400\nIt's there to test the cable itself and\nmake sure that you can send\n\n353\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.660\nan electrical current down there, and\nalso detects things like Tx/Rx reversals.\n\n354\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.320\nRight, and again, Tx/Rx reversal,\njust technical term for\n\n355\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.540\nthe transmit pins have\nbeen reversed somehow.\n\n356\n00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.110\nReceive pins, Rx,\nhave been reversed somehow as well.\n\n357\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.170\nThese are some of these hardware\ntools that you need to be aware of.\n\n358\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.858\nAnd they're very very important\n\n359\n00:20:14.858 --> 00:20:19.980\nto understand what scenario\nyou might use them for, right?\n\n360\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.770\nIf it's an optical time domain\nreflectometer, we're talking fiber optics.\n\n361\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:29.270\nOr if it's a light meter, we're gonna\nbe talking about fiber optics as well.\n\n362\n00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.890\nIf it's a cable tester, depends on\nwhat kind of cable you're testing.\n\n363\n00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.940\nYou will see that there are different\ntesters for different types of cables,\n\n364\n00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.060\nand what I mean by that, media types.\n\n365\n00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.020\nWhether it's twisted pair implementations,\nor whether it's, for instance,\n\n366\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.040\ncoaxial, right.\n\n367\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.070\nThe cable tester that we have does both,\nright.\n\n368\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.515\nIt will test coaxial cable,\n\n369\n00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:52.120\nit'll also test your twisted\npair implementations too.\n\n370\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.030\nRemember, punch down tools allow you to\nhardwire these conductors into the back of\n\n371\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.855\npatch panels.\n\n372\n00:20:57.855 --> 00:21:00.210\nInto the back of your wall outlets,\n\n373\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.410\nwhere your premise wire's\ncoming down through the wall.\n\n374\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.470\nAnd you got a bare cable\nthat's kinda sticking out of\n\n375\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.210\nwhere the faceplate would be.\n\n376\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.139\nIt allows you to hard wire them\ninto the back of the faceplate, and\n\n377\n00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:13.120\nthen you're gonna screw the faceplate in.\n\n378\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.190\nAnd now people can plug the drops\nright into the wall, right?\n\n379\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.340\nCable crimpers, remember,\nthe cable crimpers will be used for\n\n380\n00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.030\nyour twisted pair implementations.\n\n381\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:25.140\nAnd that works on RJ-45 jacks as\nwell as things like RJ-11 jacks,\n\n382\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.710\nshould you need to use those.\n\n383\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.965\nThey also have coaxial cable crimpers too,\nright,\n\n384\n00:21:29.965 --> 00:21:32.455\nif you happen to need to\nmake a coaxial cable.\n\n385\n00:21:32.455 --> 00:21:35.905\nNow in networking, chances are you're\nreally not gonna terminating a coaxial\n\n386\n00:21:35.905 --> 00:21:37.435\ncable for networking communications.\n\n387\n00:21:37.435 --> 00:21:41.230\nBut I can tell you,\nour directors here at ITProTV,\n\n388\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.685\nthey use a coaxial cable\ncrimper all the time.\n\n389\n00:21:44.685 --> 00:21:49.250\nBecause we have thousands of meters\nof coaxial cable running to things\n\n390\n00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.560\nlike audio communications,\nvideo communications there too.\n\n391\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.640\nAnd who knows, you might be actually\nsupporting that, I'm not sure.\n\n392\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.120\nYou might end up working for a company\nthat maybe does all the structure cabling\n\n393\n00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.770\ninside of a building, so\nnever say never on that.\n\n394\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.570\nYou might actually see that you're\ngonna be using something like that.\n\n395\n00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.090\nNow, that being said,\nwe mentioned that those\n\n396\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:16.770\nare the hardware utilities\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n397\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.800\nWell, there are also other utilities\nthat we need to keep in mind.\n\n398\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.420\nBecause while these utilities allow us\nto test things like our physical medium,\n\n399\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.730\nsometimes we need to be able\nto test more of the logical\n\n400\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.130\nnature of our network right?\n\n401\n00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.600\nSo for\ninstance may be I'm trying to figure out,\n\n402\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.460\nwhy isn't a DHCP operating for me, right?\n\n403\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.585\nWhy can't I get a communication from\nthis machine to this machine, right?\n\n404\n00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:47.160\nWell, there are some software\nbased utilities we need to worry,\n\n405\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.920\nbut Zach's giving me that eye.\n\n406\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.830\nI think we might have\nto go into a part two.\n\n407\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.177\n&gt;&gt; Network troubleshooting\n\n408\n00:22:53.177 --> 00:22:54.710\ntools part two's coming up.\n\n409\n00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.970\nWe've seen network\ntroubleshooting tools part one,\n\n410\n00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.068\nwhere we got to look at the hardware,\nwhich is a lot of fun.\n\n411\n00:22:59.068 --> 00:23:03.160\nAnd you wanna make sure you watch every\nsingle episode of the accelerated Net+\n\n412\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.650\nthat Wes is putting together for you.\n\n413\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.750\nAnd while you're in that course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos, and\n\n414\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.220\nthey're there to help you go further,\ncheck those out.\n\n415\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.150\nTell everyone you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n416\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.260\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan\n\n417\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.690\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n418\n00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:25.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n419\n00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.485\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.522\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:12.065\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:16.107\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:20.602\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Accelerated Net+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:23.732\nCommon Network Issues is\nthe title of this episode, and\n\n8\n00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.736\nWes Bryan is here to show us the way.\n\n9\n00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:26.477\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you too, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.396\nThat's right, we are going to be looking\nat, well, not just wired network issues.\n\n12\n00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:35.327\nBut we're also going to be looking\nat wireless issues, too, so\n\n13\n00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:38.118\nwe kind of bundled them together\nhere in the Accelerated+.\n\n14\n00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:40.780\nWe can talk about some of\nthe things that you might face.\n\n15\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.877\nAnd you're going to see that a lot of the\nthings that we talk about really is going\n\n16\n00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:49.118\nto boil down to things like, well, that\nreally have the physical layer, right?\n\n17\n00:00:49.118 --> 00:00:51.740\nIn another episode,\nwe talked about network services and\n\n18\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.923\nnetwork service issues.\n\n19\n00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:55.039\nAnd a lot of times when we talk\nabout network service issues.\n\n20\n00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.764\nThey can really manifest themselves right\nfrom the data link layer all the way up\n\n21\n00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:00.996\nreally all the way up to\nthe application layer.\n\n22\n00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.997\nWhen we start talking about things like\nwired and wireless network issues.\n\n23\n00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:07.263\nWhat we're talking about are the things\nthat directly affect the media that we use\n\n24\n00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:08.934\nor the transmission media, if you will.\n\n25\n00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.675\nOr medium that we use to send\ninformation across our networks.\n\n26\n00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:15.100\nAnd some of them have similarities,\nin fact,\n\n27\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.906\nwhen we talk about things\nlike attenuation, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:21.521\nAttenuation can effect a wired\ncommunication just like it can affect\n\n29\n00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.460\na wireless communication, right?\n\n30\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.657\nSo some of these you will see, and we'll\ntalk a little bit more about attenuation.\n\n31\n00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:30.109\nBut some of these will not only\naffect the wired networks but\n\n32\n00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.608\nthey'll also affect wireless networks.\n\n33\n00:01:32.608 --> 00:01:35.946\nSome of them are going to be a little\nbit more specific, if you will,\n\n34\n00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:38.140\nto a wired network or a wireless network.\n\n35\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.103\nSo let's go ahead, and\nwithout further ado, let's jump right in.\n\n36\n00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:44.242\nSo we're going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to talk about attenuation first.\n\n37\n00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:47.541\nAll right, when we need to\nthink about attenuation, Zach.\n\n38\n00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:52.079\nIn another episode that you and I did, we\ntalked about standards of the Cat cables.\n\n39\n00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.022\nI don't know,\nI'm going to test his knowledge,\n\n40\n00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:55.700\ndo you remember how long\na Cat cable can be?\n\n41\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.165\n&gt;&gt; 110 something.\n\n42\n00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:57.769\n&gt;&gt; He was close, 100 meters.\n\n43\n00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew that!\n\n44\n00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.104\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've got to throw Zach\n\n45\n00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:03.780\na curveball, right?\n\n46\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.486\nAnd there's a lot of specifications,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:06.290\n&gt;&gt; 100 meters.\n&gt;&gt; Which is why you've got\n\n48\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.860\nto do your study.\n\n49\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.470\nYeah, exactly, 100 meters,\n328 feet, so what is attenuation?\n\n50\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.392\nThe progressive degradation of\na signal as it gets further and\n\n51\n00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:15.918\nfurther from its transmitter.\n\n52\n00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:18.755\nThe thing is,\nwe want that signal to remain strong,\n\n53\n00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.150\nwhether it's an electromagnetic signal.\n\n54\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.623\nOr whether it's an optical light source,\nor even whether it's a wireless\n\n55\n00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:29.603\ncommunication, right,\nit's just the degrading of the signal.\n\n56\n00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:34.067\nNow in a wired network, attenuation,\na lot of times, can happen when you try to\n\n57\n00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:38.120\nrun your network cables\nlonger than what is standard.\n\n58\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.621\nThe reason I threw that curveball there at\nZach is because 100 meters is the maximum\n\n59\n00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:43.255\ndistance.\n\n60\n00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:47.278\nBut let's say that somebody didn't\nunderstand what the maximum classification\n\n61\n00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:48.566\nfor an Ethernet cable is.\n\n62\n00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:52.402\nAnd let's just take your example and\nsay 110 something, we'll call it meters.\n\n63\n00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:54.376\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, what that means,\n\n64\n00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:57.760\nit's going to be a little bit\nfurther than what the standard is.\n\n65\n00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.351\nAnd there is a reason that\nthey have those standards,\n\n66\n00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:02.436\nit means that if you\ngo past the standards.\n\n67\n00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:05.233\nYou do run the risk of,\nwithout implementing repeaters,\n\n68\n00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.011\nwhich just regenerates the signal.\n\n69\n00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:09.237\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n70\n00:03:09.237 --> 00:03:11.860\n&gt;&gt; That signal strength is\njust going to get too weak.\n\n71\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.378\nAnd this can cause integrity problems\nwithin the transmission itself,\n\n72\n00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:19.646\nas well as slow performance.\n\n73\n00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:23.195\nSo do keep in mind that attenuation\nis something that we have to worry\n\n74\n00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:24.510\nabout, right?\n\n75\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.703\nWhen it comes to wireless networks,\nwhy is the signal degrading?\n\n76\n00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:31.269\nWell, there's many things that\ncould attenuate the signal, and\n\n77\n00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.379\nwe'll look at some of those coming up.\n\n78\n00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.830\nLatency, what is latency?\n\n79\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.983\nLatency is a delay, latency is a delay\nfrom the time that a command is given,\n\n80\n00:03:40.983 --> 00:03:42.923\nand the output is received.\n\n81\n00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:46.353\nAnd what I mean by command is,\nlet's say, for instance,\n\n82\n00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:49.930\nI'm querying the DNS server for\nname resolution, right?\n\n83\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.860\nThat's the command, hey, give me\nthat name to that IP address, right?\n\n84\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.578\nWell, the longer it takes to get that\nresponse back, the more of the delay,\n\n85\n00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:00.662\nthe more the increased latency.\n\n86\n00:04:00.662 --> 00:04:04.279\nI have used a term many times that\nisn't a term, this is a Wes-ism,\n\n87\n00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:05.428\nif you will, [LAUGH].\n\n88\n00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:08.009\nAnd when I say that,\nI call it, delatency, [LAUGH].\n\n89\n00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.524\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Delatency, a combination of delay and\n\n90\n00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:10.614\nlatency, so\nthat you can kind of remember it.\n\n91\n00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:12.661\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n92\n00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:16.482\n&gt;&gt; And I kind of made this\nturn up on the exam, just so\n\n93\n00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:19.018\nyou would be aware of what it is.\n\n94\n00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:21.751\nWhen we talk about something like latency,\nlet's just,\n\n95\n00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:24.778\nI've got a little diagram here,\na very basic diagram, right?\n\n96\n00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:26.960\nIt just means that you've got\na transmit instruction, right?\n\n97\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.659\nWhatever the command is, and again,\nit could be a DNS name resolution request,\n\n98\n00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.676\nit could be visiting a web server.\n\n99\n00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:37.808\nHow long does it take you to\nget to that web server, right?\n\n100\n00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:40.640\nAnd you've got some kind of\ntransmit instruction, right?\n\n101\n00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.669\nAnd, again,\nthink about our networks, right?\n\n102\n00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.361\nWe're typically, we have clients that\nare requesting resources, all right, and\n\n103\n00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.722\nthen resources are provided.\n\n104\n00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:51.769\nIf there's a delay in the resources that\nare provided, the data that's received,\n\n105\n00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:53.600\nand then we have latency, all right?\n\n106\n00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.164\nNow, there's another thing\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n107\n00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:59.748\nAnd by the way, like I said,\nlatency affects wireless networks,\n\n108\n00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:03.337\njust as well as it affects wired networks,\nso either way, right?\n\n109\n00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:05.870\nThis can affect both types of networks.\n\n110\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.766\nAnother thing that can also attack, or\n\n111\n00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.588\naffect both types of networks\nis what's known as jitter.\n\n112\n00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:12.292\nNow, jitter is interesting, right?\n\n113\n00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:17.662\nJitter is this phenomenon that\ncan happen within your networks\n\n114\n00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:24.363\nwhen there is an uneven interval between\nsequential transmissions, right?\n\n115\n00:05:24.363 --> 00:05:26.069\nSo, for instance,\nlet me show you here, right?\n\n116\n00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.843\nSo when it comes to jitter,\nlet's just say,\n\n117\n00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:31.990\ntheoretically, normal transmissions,\nright?\n\n118\n00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.391\nNormal communications, right?\n\n119\n00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:37.700\nPackets should be received in intervals\naround ten milliseconds, right?\n\n120\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.480\nIf we have an optimized network, right?\n\n121\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.664\nWell, what happens with jitter is\nthat there is an inconsistency\n\n122\n00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:48.784\nin the intervals between the time\nthat the information is sent.\n\n123\n00:05:48.784 --> 00:05:51.593\nAnd then the time that\nthe information is received.\n\n124\n00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:54.474\nAll right,\nwhat can we do about that, right?\n\n125\n00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:58.375\nFor instance, what kind of devices would\nthat effect, what kind of services?\n\n126\n00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:02.510\nWell, voice over IP, because voice over\nIP is a real-time delivery, right?\n\n127\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.849\nYou need to use things like RTP,\nReal-Time Transport Protocol, right?\n\n128\n00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.055\nWe need to make sure that that information\ngets to the destination fast, right?\n\n129\n00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:15.588\nThat's one of the benefits of voice over\nIP ,or benefits, drawbacks, I guess,\n\n130\n00:06:15.588 --> 00:06:17.571\ndepending on how you implement it.\n\n131\n00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.570\nAnd that's why we implement things\nlike quality of service, right?\n\n132\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.387\nWe don't want jitter.\n\n133\n00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:27.123\nSo we make sure our bandwidth or\nnetwork resources get a little bit more\n\n134\n00:06:27.123 --> 00:06:31.160\nallocation to the voice\nover IP communications.\n\n135\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.408\nUnlike something like\nfile transfer protocol,\n\n136\n00:06:34.408 --> 00:06:38.297\nwhich generally doesn't matter,\nbut latency, right?\n\n137\n00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:41.090\nLatency might be a problem with\nthings like transferring files.\n\n138\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.023\nSo, again, keep in mind that both\nof these issues, if you will,\n\n139\n00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:49.898\ncan effect wired and\nwireless networks likewise.\n\n140\n00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:51.766\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n141\n00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:54.569\nNow this is going to be one that I would\nsay is probably going to be something\n\n142\n00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.620\nthat's going to effect more\nof your wired networks.\n\n143\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.798\nAnd this is something known as crosstalk,\nall right,\n\n144\n00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:02.779\nthose of you that are coming\nover from A+ studies.\n\n145\n00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.867\nYou probably remember in A+ where we talk\nabout things like parallel communications,\n\n146\n00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:08.534\ncopper parallel communications.\n\n147\n00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:11.239\nLet me be careful with that, and\nI'll tell you why here in a second,\n\n148\n00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:12.912\ncopper based parallel communications.\n\n149\n00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:17.728\nWhat were some of the limitations to\nthe parallel communications, parallel ATA,\n\n150\n00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.800\nparallel-based SCSI?\n\n151\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.266\nWell, you have adjacent copper conductors,\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:22.266 --> 00:07:27.456\nAnd what happens is, as you increase\npower along multiple copper conductors,\n\n153\n00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:29.866\nwhat you have is you have bleed over.\n\n154\n00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.540\nYou have one conductor is\ncarrying a data signal.\n\n155\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.401\nAnd that electrical current bleeds\nover to an adjacent conductor and\n\n156\n00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:42.014\nit causes some kind of interference,\nif you will.\n\n157\n00:07:42.014 --> 00:07:46.800\nAnd it negatively affects the signal\nthat's being carried and can corrupt it.\n\n158\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.807\nSo that's what we see in\nthings like motherboards and\n\n159\n00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:51.316\nsome of the other communications\nthat we've talked about in A+.\n\n160\n00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:54.794\nBut, you can also see crosstalk in things\nlike your copper based lines, right,\n\n161\n00:07:54.794 --> 00:07:56.757\nyour copper media that we've talked about.\n\n162\n00:07:56.757 --> 00:07:59.802\nYou look at coaxial implementations,\nand I know coaxial\n\n163\n00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:02.947\nimplementations aren't really\n&gt;&gt; Used too much for our networking\n\n164\n00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:06.182\ncommunications, but we still use it\nheavily in audio and video equipment.\n\n165\n00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:09.577\nAnd that's why you use balanced\naudio in certain applications and\n\n166\n00:08:09.577 --> 00:08:12.860\nunbalanced audio or video,\nif you will in other applications.\n\n167\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.558\nBut in our twisted pear implementations,\nremember that one of the things that we\n\n168\n00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:22.260\nwanna try to do is eliminate or reduce to\nan acceptable level the electromagnetic\n\n169\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.980\ninterference or EMI that can make\nits way into a copper based media.\n\n170\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.681\nAs we undo the twist within those\ntwisted pair implementations,\n\n171\n00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:37.493\nthe cat cables to terminate them, the more\nof the twist lengthwise that we undo,\n\n172\n00:08:37.493 --> 00:08:40.840\nthe more susceptible it\nbecome to crosstalk.\n\n173\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.511\nAnd again, that bleeding over of the line.\n\n174\n00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:44.977\nNow, there's a few different\ntypes of crosstalks I will say.\n\n175\n00:08:44.977 --> 00:08:47.690\nYou have what's known\nas near-end crosstalk.\n\n176\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.417\nThey call it NEXT for short.\n\n177\n00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:54.804\nNear-end crosstalk is one where it\nhappens at the ends of the cable.\n\n178\n00:08:54.804 --> 00:08:58.843\nA lot of times,\nit's through improper termination.\n\n179\n00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:01.112\nIt could be the cable's damaged and\n\n180\n00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:05.346\nwhat happens is the signal actually\nas it hits the end of the cable,\n\n181\n00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:09.444\nit actually bleeds over and\nit can be entered back into the line.\n\n182\n00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:10.727\nYou can get, again,\n\n183\n00:09:10.727 --> 00:09:15.734\nmore of this electromagnetic interference\nlike you hinder your communications.\n\n184\n00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:18.016\nBut then you also have\nthings like alien crosstalk.\n\n185\n00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:19.917\nAnd no, I'm not saying aliens.\n\n186\n00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:21.170\nI'm just saying, aliens.\n\n187\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, but what I mean as alien crosstalk\n\n188\n00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:27.772\nis essentially, when you have\nmultiple copper conductors or\n\n189\n00:09:27.772 --> 00:09:31.204\nmultiple copper based cables\nthat are in a bundle and\n\n190\n00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:36.289\none of those cables basically bleeds\ncrosstalk over into an adjacent cable.\n\n191\n00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:37.866\nIt's why they call it alien cable.\n\n192\n00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:42.353\nSo near-end crosstalk means the crosstalk\nis in the same line that electromagnetic\n\n193\n00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:45.907\ninterference is coming from\nthe cable that it's also affecting.\n\n194\n00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:50.501\nAlien crosstalk means that we have\na cable that is actually causing\n\n195\n00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:54.367\nelectromagnetic interference\nwith adjacent cables.\n\n196\n00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:55.878\nSo it's not internal.\n\n197\n00:09:55.878 --> 00:09:57.690\nThat's why they call it alien crosstalk.\n\n198\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.761\nSo again, this is just a form of\nelectromagnetic interference or\n\n199\n00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:03.468\ninterference in general.\n\n200\n00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:04.870\nAnd well, guess what?\n\n201\n00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.959\nInterference can affect both wired and\nwireless network.\n\n202\n00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:12.357\nWhen we talk about interference,\nwe have electromagnetic interference, EMI.\n\n203\n00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:17.145\nElectromagnetic interference in a wired\nnetwork can be for many different sources.\n\n204\n00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:19.590\nHVAC systems, heating and ventilation and\nAC, especially with heating.\n\n205\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.650\nAnything that uses some kind of\nheating element like space heaters,\n\n206\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.759\nthey give off a lot of electricity.\n\n207\n00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:28.331\nAnd anything that gives off electricity,\n\n208\n00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:32.476\nif you have cables that are adjacent\nto it, what's gonna happen is it\n\n209\n00:10:32.476 --> 00:10:36.918\ncan produce interference in the line or\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n210\n00:10:36.918 --> 00:10:39.547\nNow, we also have\ninterference in wireless and\n\n211\n00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:43.702\nthere's many different things that\ncan cause interference in wireless.\n\n212\n00:10:43.702 --> 00:10:48.065\nOne of the things that can cause some\nkind of interference in wireless is for\n\n213\n00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.666\ninstance, reflections.\n\n214\n00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:51.679\nIt's going to interfere with the signals.\n\n215\n00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:53.252\nIt's going to impede the signal.\n\n216\n00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.896\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n217\n00:10:54.896 --> 00:10:59.083\nAnd I'm sure we've got a very smart crowd\nout there, you know what reflection is.\n\n218\n00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.511\nYou have a transmitter\nthat is sending a signal.\n\n219\n00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:05.077\nYou have a receiver that is supposed\nto be the recipient of that signal.\n\n220\n00:11:05.077 --> 00:11:07.941\nAnd a lot of times, our network adapters,\nthey're called transceivers.\n\n221\n00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:11.812\nWhy?\nBecause they transmit and receive.\n\n222\n00:11:11.812 --> 00:11:13.860\nImagine that, that's communication.\n\n223\n00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.696\nTransmit and receive.\n\n224\n00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:16.290\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n225\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.191\n&gt;&gt; The problem, though is sometimes\nthe transmitter can be transmitting\n\n226\n00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:25.774\nin a direction where the signal\nactually reflects or bounces off.\n\n227\n00:11:25.774 --> 00:11:27.963\nThings like obstacles, they're in the way.\n\n228\n00:11:27.963 --> 00:11:31.900\nLike for instance,\nif you have antenna in placement and\n\n229\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:38.140\nyou place that antenna, lets say in\na ceiling near some kind of like metal.\n\n230\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.058\nAnd I'm not talking about duck goes quack,\nquack.\n\n231\n00:11:40.058 --> 00:11:43.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about D-U-C-T and\n\n232\n00:11:43.673 --> 00:11:46.114\nit causes signal reflection.\n\n233\n00:11:46.114 --> 00:11:48.850\nThe other thing too is refraction.\n\n234\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.650\nThis can also cause signal loss.\n\n235\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.562\nIt's a form of interference, if you will.\n\n236\n00:11:52.562 --> 00:11:56.904\nIt can impede the signal can\nalso attenuate to signal two.\n\n237\n00:11:56.904 --> 00:12:01.982\nBut the difference here with refraction\nis rather than reflect and bouncing\n\n238\n00:12:01.982 --> 00:12:07.527\noff it actually, the refracted signal kind\nof moves it in a different direction.\n\n239\n00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:09.540\nIt doesn't necessarily reflect it.\n\n240\n00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.120\nI'd give an you an example.\n\n241\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.920\nHave you ever may be sink in\nthe hole like a fish in the water or\n\n242\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.189\nsomething, or\nmay be you put a stick in the water and\n\n243\n00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:22.854\nthat you could see that reflection\nof the image that you're looking at?\n\n244\n00:12:22.854 --> 00:12:25.080\nIt doesn't look like\nthey're in the same spot.\n\n245\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.967\nWell, that's because light refracts water.\n\n246\n00:12:26.967 --> 00:12:31.308\nA portion of the signal and\nit bends the signal in a different way.\n\n247\n00:12:31.308 --> 00:12:34.902\nWe also have refraction that we have to\nworry about too and you can see an example\n\n248\n00:12:34.902 --> 00:12:38.184\nof a non-refracted signal between\ntransceiver, and receiver here.\n\n249\n00:12:38.184 --> 00:12:40.941\nMy head's kinda covering this up though,\nbut\n\n250\n00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:44.841\nyou can see that the signal is\nrefracted rather than reflective.\n\n251\n00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:48.261\nAnd in fact,\nin certain communications, refraction,\n\n252\n00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:50.410\na refracted signal is what we want.\n\n253\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.459\nI mean, that's how fiber.\n\n254\n00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:55.468\nWhen we talk about fiber optic\ncommunications, multimode fiber,\n\n255\n00:12:55.468 --> 00:12:59.125\nit relies on total internal\nrefraction to propagate bouncing\n\n256\n00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:01.250\nthat signal off of the glass cores.\n\n257\n00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.536\nKeeping it contained within\nthe core versus reflected,\n\n258\n00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:11.260\nwhich means bouncing the way off and\naway from whatever the source might be.\n\n259\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.314\nOther things that can\ncause interference too.\n\n260\n00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:20.210\nWe talk about putting two of the access\npoints basically on the same channel and\n\n261\n00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.873\nyou can get things like\nchannel congestion, and\n\n262\n00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:29.524\nthat can cause problems when you have\nchannel overlap is what they call it.\n\n263\n00:13:29.524 --> 00:13:34.035\nKeep in mind that you have to watch\nwith channel overlap, because what\n\n264\n00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:39.010\nchannel overlap can do is cause what's\nknown as co-channel interference.\n\n265\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.538\nAnd this goes back to what we have to keep\nin mind when it comes to how the media\n\n266\n00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:44.224\nis accessed in a wireless network.\n\n267\n00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:48.049\nI want you to think of the carrier sense\nmultiple access collision avoidance.\n\n268\n00:13:48.049 --> 00:13:50.794\nCollision avoidance is\na wait in line method.\n\n269\n00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:54.651\nAnd if you have co-channel existence,\nyou have one access point operating on\n\n270\n00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:57.982\na channel, let's say in the 2.4\ngigahertz spectrum, the ISM or\n\n271\n00:13:57.982 --> 00:14:00.099\nIidustrial scientific and medical band.\n\n272\n00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:04.198\nAnd then you have another access point,\nmaybe owned by somebody else or\n\n273\n00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:07.887\nmaybe even by yourself that is\nsitting on an adjacent channel and\n\n274\n00:14:07.887 --> 00:14:09.887\nthat channel bandwidth overlap.\n\n275\n00:14:09.887 --> 00:14:14.283\nWell, what can happen is that one access\npoint can actually be interfering with\n\n276\n00:14:14.283 --> 00:14:19.370\nthe whole media access technology\nthat's used in both wireless networks.\n\n277\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.538\nBecause keep in mind, carrier sets\nmultiple access collision avoidance.\n\n278\n00:14:22.538 --> 00:14:25.817\nIt means that if there's\na collision that is detected,\n\n279\n00:14:25.817 --> 00:14:28.417\nthen we're gonna wait a back-off period.\n\n280\n00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:32.724\nWell, in waiting a back-off period, if\nyou keep having these collisions happen,\n\n281\n00:14:32.724 --> 00:14:36.669\nbecause of co-channel interference or\nco-channel overlap, it could make\n\n282\n00:14:36.669 --> 00:14:41.200\nthe signal or it could the performance to\nthe wireless network look like it's slow.\n\n283\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.934\nWhen really,\n\n284\n00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:45.734\nall the devices are doing are waiting\nin line to avoid that interference.\n\n285\n00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:48.069\nSo you definitely have\nto worry about that.\n\n286\n00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:52.146\nCuz again, the CA timeouts will make\nthe network communications look slow and\n\n287\n00:14:52.146 --> 00:14:55.740\none of the things that you can\ndo is proper channel planning.\n\n288\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.596\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n289\n00:14:57.596 --> 00:15:02.117\nLet me launch up our Wi-Fi explorer\nhere and I'll show you what I mean.\n\n290\n00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:06.798\nNotice that we've got a lot of\ndifferent access points that are in\n\n291\n00:15:06.798 --> 00:15:09.021\nthe proximity of our network.\n\n292\n00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:12.903\nYou can see some of these with\na SSID's there, the SSIDs or\n\n293\n00:15:12.903 --> 00:15:17.000\nthe ITPro.TV and\nsome other companies around here.\n\n294\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.721\nBut I want you to notice something here.\n\n295\n00:15:18.721 --> 00:15:21.384\nNotice that we have channel one and\nchannel two.\n\n296\n00:15:21.384 --> 00:15:25.394\nThis is a cause channel one interference.\n\n297\n00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:28.556\nAgain, because remember that we\nhave that 20 megahertz bandwidth.\n\n298\n00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:31.809\nAnd if you have channel 1,\n20 megahertz and then channel 2,\n\n299\n00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:33.566\nthey are overlapping each other.\n\n300\n00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:38.167\nAnd again,\nthey can cause signal interference.\n\n301\n00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.834\nSo proper channel planning is important.\n\n302\n00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:44.824\nThat's why you need to use your\nsite survey software something\n\n303\n00:15:44.824 --> 00:15:49.716\nlike this where you using a Wi-Fi Analyzer\nthat can show you what the existing\n\n304\n00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.986\naccess points in your network are.\n\n305\n00:15:51.986 --> 00:15:56.431\nSo worry about thing like again, channel\noverlap and it's something you can do,\n\n306\n00:15:56.431 --> 00:15:58.049\nessentially just to detect.\n\n307\n00:15:58.049 --> 00:15:59.718\nHey, I've got an access point.\n\n308\n00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:03.607\nNotice that one access point AP1,\nif you will.\n\n309\n00:16:03.607 --> 00:16:05.986\nIs on channel one, or channel seven.\n\n310\n00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:08.914\nWell, I've got one that's on channel six,\nand I've got one that's on channel eight.\n\n311\n00:16:08.914 --> 00:16:13.421\nAll three of those different channels will\noverlap and they will cause issues, right?\n\n312\n00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:16.730\nSo proper channel planning\nis the way to go there.\n\n313\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.190\nAll right, now the next thing we gotta\ntalk about is more for a wired network.\n\n314\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:26.530\nAnd this is an open,\nsome kind of open cable, or a short.\n\n315\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.490\nWhen we talk about a short,\n\n316\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.100\nremember this is typically a damaged\ncable that's causing the problem.\n\n317\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.080\nIt could be a network\nadapter that's failing,\n\n318\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.520\nright, or other things too instead\nof the network adapter is failing.\n\n319\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.436\nIt could just be a bad port.\n\n320\n00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:39.830\nAgain, bad ports also cause issues, too.\n\n321\n00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.980\nThe other thing that I've seen, too,\nis that if people get in a hurry and\n\n322\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.850\nthey're installing.\n\n323\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.200\nA lot of times your motherboards today and\nthings like PCs are integrated,\n\n324\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.060\nthe network adapter is integrated\ninto the motherboard itself.\n\n325\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.936\nSo if it happens that during\nthe motherboard installation or somebody\n\n326\n00:16:55.936 --> 00:17:00.286\ndamaged the motherboard, that could\ncause a bad port on the network adapter.\n\n327\n00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:02.837\nOr what I have seen is when\npeople get in a hurry and\n\n328\n00:17:02.837 --> 00:17:06.820\nthey just quickly throw that expansion\ncard in there, or the adapter card,\n\n329\n00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.760\nthe network adapter in the machine,\nthey actually twist the port on that.\n\n330\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.918\nI've actually seen that, or\n\n331\n00:17:11.918 --> 00:17:14.830\nover time where the port actually\ngets a little bit loose on there,\n\n332\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.530\ncauses some kind of short or\ncauses just that the port quits working.\n\n333\n00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.172\nWhich is why it's important.\n\n334\n00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:25.919\nAlso, and this goes with\npretty much any wired network\n\n335\n00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:29.437\nadapter is to check the lights, right?\n\n336\n00:17:29.437 --> 00:17:31.415\nCheck your activity lights.\n\n337\n00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:36.210\nYou have on your network adapters, right,\nyou have the LED status indicators.\n\n338\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.060\nCheck them out.\n\n339\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.140\nDo you have a link, right, that solid\nlight that says hey, the carrier sense,\n\n340\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.330\nwhat is it, carrier sense multiple access\ncollision detection, carrier sense,\n\n341\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.160\nI can sense the media's present, right?\n\n342\n00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.241\nThe link light's on.\n\n343\n00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:49.600\nNow how about the activity light?\n\n344\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.860\nIs the activity light moving?\n\n345\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.190\nIf it is, is it a green light or\nis it amber?\n\n346\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.870\nA lot of times you'll see it's green and\namber.\n\n347\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.667\nAmber denotes a collision.\n\n348\n00:17:57.667 --> 00:18:01.755\nBut I will tell you that\nthe more amber lights you'll see,\n\n349\n00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:05.606\nis also the sign of things\nlike broadcast collisions.\n\n350\n00:18:05.606 --> 00:18:07.662\nAnd the more of those\namber lights you see,\n\n351\n00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:09.560\nthe more collisions that are going on.\n\n352\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.300\nSo it might be a telltale sign\nthat you have for whatever reason,\n\n353\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.860\nsomebody put a hub in your network and\nit can be causing broadcast storms.\n\n354\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.550\n&gt;&gt; Like Wes always says,\nsimple fixes first.\n\n355\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, Zach.\n\n356\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:22.905\nOne of the things that we stress,\n\n357\n00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:25.735\nespecially when you're talking about some\nof the things that we're mentioning here\n\n358\n00:18:25.735 --> 00:18:28.340\n,because again, remember the OSI model.\n\n359\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.440\nSimple fixes first,\nstart at the physical layer, right?\n\n360\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.640\nAnd if I don't have network\ncommunications, are my cables plugged in?\n\n361\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.080\nDo I have link, those lights, the LED\nindicators, do I have activity, right?\n\n362\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.310\nSo it is important.\n\n363\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Now some of the other things that\n\n364\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.930\nwe'll also have to worry about,\ninfrared cable type.\n\n365\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.020\nThis can affect your transmission speeds,\n\n366\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.010\nright, especially if you're talking about\na 10 gig network, a 10G based network, and\n\n367\n00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.790\nyou're running something\nlike a cat5e cable.\n\n368\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.383\nIt's not gonna give you the 10G speeds,\nright?\n\n369\n00:18:55.383 --> 00:18:59.370\nA Cat6 cable will, but\nyou're running at more than 55 meters.\n\n370\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.120\nWell, 10G networks do not tolerate\nelectromagnetic interference, and\n\n371\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.950\nthey certainly don't tolerate\ncables that are longer than what\n\n372\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.260\nthe specification means, right?\n\n373\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.590\nThere's not a lot of room for error there.\n\n374\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.640\nIncorrect pin out, when it come to\npin out this is your wired cables.\n\n375\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.170\nAnd remember we talked about 568A and\n568B?\n\n376\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.062\nYou can't change the pins\non the network adapter, or\n\n377\n00:19:21.062 --> 00:19:24.222\nyou're making a bad network adapter,\nyou just broke it.\n\n378\n00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:29.710\nBut what you can do is you can change\nthe wiring in the back of the RJ45 jack.\n\n379\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.740\nAnd if you start to get, wiring is wrong\nand it doesn't match those standards,\n\n380\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.480\nthen what ends up happening\nis you get an incorrect pin.\n\n381\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.957\nWe might have pin one and\ntwo on one side that are orange, right,\n\n382\n00:19:42.957 --> 00:19:48.146\nwhite stripe with orange, and\nthen the solid orange cable.\n\n383\n00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.702\nBut on the other side, if they happen\nto be blue for whatever reason,\n\n384\n00:19:50.702 --> 00:19:53.788\nbecause somebody doesn't pay attention\nto what they're doing when they wire it,\n\n385\n00:19:53.788 --> 00:19:55.618\nyou're gonna get an incorrect pin out,\nright?\n\n386\n00:19:55.618 --> 00:19:58.852\nBut by and large,\nthat's gonna do to the wiring, right,\n\n387\n00:19:58.852 --> 00:20:01.779\nwhich can also cause things\nlike TX/RX reversals.\n\n388\n00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:03.910\nTX/RX, just transmission receive, right?\n\n389\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.580\nAnd positions or pins,\none and two for transmit.\n\n390\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.040\nPositions or pins three and\nsix for receive pins.\n\n391\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.310\nRemember, it's about how\nyou wire the cable that\n\n392\n00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.280\nmakes all the difference, right?\n\n393\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:22.729\nThe other thing, too, duplex and\nspeed mismatches, this could happen.\n\n394\n00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:25.387\nA lot of times it doesn't happen.\n\n395\n00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:27.467\nWhen we're talking about duplex,\n\n396\n00:20:27.467 --> 00:20:31.974\nremember that we're talking about is\nthe switch operating in full duplex and\n\n397\n00:20:31.974 --> 00:20:37.290\nthe device is operating or the node is\noperating in half duplex or vice versa.\n\n398\n00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.160\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n399\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.540\nThis is typically, today,\na lot of times, it is goes through\n\n400\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.830\na phase called auto negotiation, which\nmeans when my operating system comes on,\n\n401\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.300\nit's gonna communicate a little bit\nof information to the switch and\n\n402\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.140\nswitch back to my operating system and\nsay, hey, what are you operating at?\n\n403\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:00.740\nAnd let me go a little bit farther\nhere and get into, where is it?\n\n404\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.950\nNetwork adapter, there we go.\n\n405\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.400\nSo let me go ahead and just pull up\nthe properties of the network adapter.\n\n406\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.830\nThere we go, advanced.\n\n407\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.980\nAnd you'll see here,\ndown here, if I look for,\n\n408\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.710\nit should be the duplexing\ninformation here.\n\n409\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.560\nLet's see.\n\n410\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.170\nWhere is it?\n\n411\n00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.080\nIt's in here somewhere.\n\n412\n00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.070\nThat's flow control.\n\n413\n00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.290\nThat's not what we want.\n\n414\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.910\nSpeed and Duplex, right there,\na big thing that says Speed and Duplex.\n\n415\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.620\n[LAUGH] Because you can also\nget a speed mismatch, too.\n\n416\n00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.340\nNotice how that Speed and Duplex, right,\nthey are set to Auto Negotiate, right?\n\n417\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.285\nAnd what that means is that\nI'm gonna communicate, or\n\n418\n00:21:34.285 --> 00:21:37.565\nthe operating system is gonna\ncommunicate with the switch.\n\n419\n00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:39.143\nSorry guys, gals out there.\n\n420\n00:21:39.143 --> 00:21:42.345\nThe switch should communicate and\ndo this for me.\n\n421\n00:21:42.345 --> 00:21:47.267\nHowever, sometimes I don't\nalways get it right, [LAUGH] and\n\n422\n00:21:47.267 --> 00:21:50.785\nthere might be a reason to go half duplex.\n\n423\n00:21:50.785 --> 00:21:55.340\nAgain, you really shouldn't be doing half\nduplex communications anyways because\n\n424\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.270\nthat will bring a whole\nentire network to a crawl.\n\n425\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.150\nBut again, you can see that you\n\n426\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.020\ncould set this manually if there\nhappens to be a duplex mismatch.\n\n427\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.574\nA lot of times, again,\nthat's going to happen for you and\n\n428\n00:22:06.574 --> 00:22:08.370\nthey are gonna communicate.\n\n429\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.750\nOther things that we have to worry about,\n\n430\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.030\ntoo, physical damage on the network\nadapter, bent pins, if you will.\n\n431\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.810\nAgain, just like pin out,\nit could be a damaged network adapter.\n\n432\n00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.900\nDamaged cables, too,\ncan also be an issue, right?\n\n433\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.215\nBottlenecks, now bottlenecks,\nwhat is a bottleneck?\n\n434\n00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:24.422\nThink of the weakest link, right?\n\n435\n00:22:24.422 --> 00:22:29.540\nA bottleneck means that everything else\nis optimized and performing at top speed,\n\n436\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.860\nbut then all of a sudden somewhere in\nthere you've got a link that, let's say,\n\n437\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.650\nis only running at 10 megs when\nyou have a gigabit network.\n\n438\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.560\nAll right, well, that link or\nthe cable that's connected\n\n439\n00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.690\nto that link is now reducing the overall\nperformance of your network.\n\n440\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.390\nIt becomes a bottleneck, right?\n\n441\n00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.380\nIt is essentially some\ncomponent within your network\n\n442\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.128\nthat can't perform to the levels that\nthe rest of the network is performing.\n\n443\n00:22:52.128 --> 00:22:57.250\nAnd again, that'll be something that is\nall part of following your standards and\n\n444\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.530\nproper planning and proper implementation.\n\n445\n00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.350\nAll right, so we've talked about a lot\nof the wireless or the wired things.\n\n446\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.850\nCouple of other things\nthat I wanna mention, and\n\n447\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.870\nI know we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n448\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.940\nWhen it comes to your wireless networks,\none of the things that you can\n\n449\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.780\nkeep in mind,\nthey talk about frequency mismatches.\n\n450\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.510\nThis really shouldn't happen if you're\nfollowing standards, right, 2.4 or\n\n451\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.800\n5 gigahertz.\n\n452\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.520\nThe only thing that would frequency\nmismatch is if you happen to\n\n453\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.460\nhave one of these adapters that\ndriver issues might be, update\n\n454\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.160\nthe drivers within the network adapters,\nmight give you a frequency mismatch just\n\n455\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.970\nto make sure that your device drivers\nare installed for your network adapters.\n\n456\n00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.010\nDistance limitations,\nno different than a wired network, right?\n\n457\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.900\nI have a distance limitation on the cable\nitself following the standards.\n\n458\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.740\nWell, guess what?\n\n459\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.270\nEach one of your 802.11 family, they have\ndistance and limitations, too, right?\n\n460\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.511\nSo one of the things that you\nhave to keep in mind is that what\n\n461\n00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:57.678\nstandard are you using, again,\ncuz that can hinder it.\n\n462\n00:23:57.678 --> 00:24:04.165\nThe other thing, too, that can influence\ndistance limitations is proper antenna.\n\n463\n00:24:04.165 --> 00:24:07.200\nThe proper antenna placement,\nproper AP placement, right?\n\n464\n00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.001\nI have to put the access point in an area\nthat if it is using antennas or like for\n\n465\n00:24:12.001 --> 00:24:16.680\ninstance, if it's using the internal\nomnidirectional antennas.\n\n466\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.506\nA lot of times what happens is if\nyou put it in the wrong area, right?\n\n467\n00:24:20.506 --> 00:24:23.689\nAgainst a wall, then that means\nessentially half the signal is going to\n\n468\n00:24:23.689 --> 00:24:26.674\nthe wall, the other half of\nthe signal is going sideways, right?\n\n469\n00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:30.106\nAgain, if you're using things\nlike the dipole antennas, well,\n\n470\n00:24:30.106 --> 00:24:31.772\nthey are directional, right?\n\n471\n00:24:31.772 --> 00:24:36.499\nYou have to make sure that they're pointed\nin the right direction likewise, too.\n\n472\n00:24:36.499 --> 00:24:40.570\nIs something to make sure,\nwhen they talk about wrong SSID and\n\n473\n00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:45.525\nsecurity type mismatch, this can happen\nwhen you have to do manual entry.\n\n474\n00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:49.560\nI'll tell you what, let me show you\nwhat I mean here on my Mac, all right?\n\n475\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.810\nSo, notice that my operating system,\n\n476\n00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.400\njust like all operating systems that\nare using wireless network adapters,\n\n477\n00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.310\nare periodically sending out what\nare known as station STA to AP probes.\n\n478\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.777\nAnd that's just basically how\nthey generate these network list,\n\n479\n00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:08.355\naccess point responded to me, I could\nsee it there, I could see its SSID or\n\n480\n00:25:08.355 --> 00:25:10.527\nthe network name associated with the SSID.\n\n481\n00:25:10.527 --> 00:25:13.062\nAll right, in order to join one of these,\n\n482\n00:25:13.062 --> 00:25:16.880\nwhat I'd have to do is I'd\njust have to select it.\n\n483\n00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.505\nAnd I have to put the password or\npassphrase depending, and passphrase could\n\n484\n00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:25.916\nbe wrong too, that's typically a typo\nthat's gonna cause the problem,\n\n485\n00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:29.068\nbut I am told that it tells\nme that it requires WPA2.\n\n486\n00:25:29.068 --> 00:25:32.405\nSo I know what the security protocol is.\n\n487\n00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:37.100\nIf there's a mismatch, that can happen\nwhen you have something like this where\n\n488\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.955\nyou're going to join another network and\nyou have to do manual entry, all right?\n\n489\n00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:46.412\nThis can happen, too, when people for\nsecurity purposes, they disable the SSID\n\n490\n00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:51.140\nbeaconing, they don't want you to find\nthe network right, so what happens, right?\n\n491\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.920\nWell, if it's not sending out its SSID,\n\n492\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.290\nmy operating system sends out\nthose little station to AP probes,\n\n493\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.950\nt's not gonna generate the SSID or\nthe network name in this list.\n\n494\n00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.029\nSo I have to come in here and\nI have to manually do this.\n\n495\n00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:10.850\nAnd if I type this wrong, right?\n\n496\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.239\nI mean, and again,\nI'm exaggerating here, but\n\n497\n00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:17.718\nnotice that I can select\nwhat the security type is.\n\n498\n00:26:17.718 --> 00:26:21.341\nAnd if I select it wrong, well,\nI'm not gonna be able to communicate\n\n499\n00:26:21.341 --> 00:26:24.849\nwith the wireless network, so\nagain, that could be some issues.\n\n500\n00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:29.349\nAgain, this a lot of times can happen when\nthere's a manual configuration that's\n\n501\n00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:30.000\nrequired.\n\n502\n00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.970\nIf there is a manual configuration and\nyou're told what the security type is and\n\n503\n00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.640\nyou still can't connect, then chances\nare you've got the passphrase or\n\n504\n00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.450\npassword wrong.\n\n505\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.230\nDon't get those confused,\npassphrase, password,\n\n506\n00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.700\nespecially in any kind of wireless PSK or\npre-showed key environment.\n\n507\n00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.800\nLet's see, what else do we got?\n\n508\n00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.510\nIncorrect antenna type.\n\n509\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.860\nRemember directional antennas?\n\n510\n00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.775\nIf you need highly-directional antennas,\n\n511\n00:26:52.775 --> 00:26:56.990\nomnidirectional antenna might not do\nexactly what you need it to do, right?\n\n512\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.270\nAnd again, that's all part of\nthings like site surveys and\n\n513\n00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:05.050\ngood wireless network planning before you\neven implement your wireless networks.\n\n514\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.535\nCouple of more things,\n\n515\n00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:11.445\none of the last two things I wanna talk\nabout is power levels that they mention.\n\n516\n00:27:11.445 --> 00:27:13.712\nPower levels directly related to the gain,\n\n517\n00:27:13.712 --> 00:27:16.594\nthe signal strength that\nthe antennas are pushing out or\n\n518\n00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:20.040\nthe access point is pushing out\nthrough the antennas, all right?\n\n519\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.561\nYou can hear that increasing\nthe power on the antennas would\n\n520\n00:27:26.561 --> 00:27:29.672\nincrease the signal strength,\nobviously, but it doesn’t\n\n521\n00:27:29.672 --> 00:27:33.837\nnecessarily mean that you’re gonna get\na better network performance, right?\n\n522\n00:27:33.837 --> 00:27:37.242\nAnytime you increase gain,\nyou also increase a potential for\n\n523\n00:27:37.242 --> 00:27:39.240\ninterference as well.\n\n524\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.148\nSo before you start to manipulate power\nlevels, which is a science in and\n\n525\n00:27:43.148 --> 00:27:44.245\nof itself, right?\n\n526\n00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:46.391\nOne that's well beyond the net plus scope,\n\n527\n00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:49.124\nI want you to consider some\nother things first, right?\n\n528\n00:27:49.124 --> 00:27:53.639\nUse it kinda power levels as,\nkinda using that as a last resort, right?\n\n529\n00:27:53.639 --> 00:27:57.490\nAntenna type, is it directional,\nhighly-directional,\n\n530\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.305\nomnidirectional, right?\n\n531\n00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:00.965\nAP placement, right?\n\n532\n00:28:00.965 --> 00:28:04.539\nBefore I even touch power levels, if I\nput the access point in the break room\n\n533\n00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:08.114\nnext to the microwave, you increase\nthe power all you want, but the moment\n\n534\n00:28:08.114 --> 00:28:12.014\nsomebody goes to lunch, we're gonna\nhave a performance segregation, right?\n\n535\n00:28:12.014 --> 00:28:14.031\nIt degrades.\n\n536\n00:28:14.031 --> 00:28:16.821\nInterference points or reflections, right?\n\n537\n00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:18.443\nIf I increase the signal strength and\n\n538\n00:28:18.443 --> 00:28:21.006\nthere's a reflection or\nthere's an obstacle in the way,\n\n539\n00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:24.004\nall I did is got the signal to\nthe reflection or the obstacle faster.\n\n540\n00:28:24.004 --> 00:28:26.152\n[LAUGH] I didn't really do anything,\nright?\n\n541\n00:28:26.152 --> 00:28:31.748\nI got a stronger reflected signal, [LAUGH]\nbut it certainly might not help you.\n\n542\n00:28:31.748 --> 00:28:32.900\nChannel overlap, right?\n\n543\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.188\nThe other thing is overcapacity.\n\n544\n00:28:35.188 --> 00:28:38.782\nAll right, that's one of\nthe reasons it's good to go to N.\n\n545\n00:28:38.782 --> 00:28:42.781\nAnd if you're not aware, Zach,\nyou asked a great question when we're\n\n546\n00:28:42.781 --> 00:28:46.861\ntalking about wireless, says,\nwhy wouldn't I just maybe go with an N?\n\n547\n00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:50.517\nAn N-based network because it gives me\nbackwards compatibility with a lot of\n\n548\n00:28:50.517 --> 00:28:54.286\ndevices, well, maybe you need things\nlike the multi-user, multi-input,\n\n549\n00:28:54.286 --> 00:28:55.539\nmulti-output, right?\n\n550\n00:28:55.539 --> 00:28:59.302\nBecause we know that there's a lot of\nhigh definition, a lot more bandwidth and\n\n551\n00:28:59.302 --> 00:29:03.246\nthe traffic types that we're producing or\nputting over these wireless networks.\n\n552\n00:29:03.246 --> 00:29:06.252\nAnd what can happen is if you got\ntoo many of those devices and\n\n553\n00:29:06.252 --> 00:29:10.164\nthe access point can't service all\nthose devices, you have over capacity,\n\n554\n00:29:10.164 --> 00:29:14.526\nand you should probably think or consider\nmoving to something like 802.11AC.\n\n555\n00:29:14.526 --> 00:29:18.304\nWhere we get eight of those memo strings,\nand we've got better bandwidth and\n\n556\n00:29:18.304 --> 00:29:21.530\npotential to handle those\ndevices a lot better.\n\n557\n00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.200\nLast but\nnot least is signal to noise ratio.\n\n558\n00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.944\nRemember, signal to noise, which one\ndo you think you want more of, right?\n\n559\n00:29:27.944 --> 00:29:30.933\nThe higher the signal to noise ratio\nthe better the performing the network.\n\n560\n00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:33.756\nThat means higher the signal,\nlower the noise.\n\n561\n00:29:33.756 --> 00:29:34.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n562\n00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.785\n&gt;&gt; Higher the noise, interference,\nelectromagnetic interference,\n\n563\n00:29:37.785 --> 00:29:39.606\nthe worse the performance, right?\n\n564\n00:29:39.606 --> 00:29:42.582\nSo again, keep that in mind,\nyou're always looking for\n\n565\n00:29:42.582 --> 00:29:46.178\na higher signal to noise ratio\nbecause it does mean that you're gonna\n\n566\n00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:49.710\nget a better quality signal,\nbetter quality performance.\n\n567\n00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.216\nThese are some of the network issues that\nyou should be aware of whether it becomes\n\n568\n00:29:53.216 --> 00:29:56.934\na wired or\nwireless inside of that Net Plus Exam.\n\n569\n00:29:56.934 --> 00:30:00.882\n&gt;&gt; Common network issues, make sure you\nwatch every single episode inside of\n\n570\n00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:05.349\nthe accelerated net plus series that Wes\ntogether for you, you'll be glad you did.\n\n571\n00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:08.472\nAnd you're in the course
