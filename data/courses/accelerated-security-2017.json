vendor\n\n3\n00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.000\nneutral certification\nexam known as Security+.\n\n4\n00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.290\nWe're gonna be talking about,\nwell, what is Security+?\n\n5\n00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.390\nSo that you'll be a little bit more\nprepared when it comes to diving into this\n\n6\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.270\nseries.\n\n7\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.290\nWe'll also talk about who this\ncourse is for, as well as\n\n8\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.190\nwhat are some of the things that we can\nexpect to see throughout this course.\n\n9\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.140\nAnd then finally before\nyou sit the hot seat and\n\n10\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.860\ntake your certification exam we wanna give\nyou a little bit of information about\n\n11\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.760\nthe structure of that exam and\nsome of the things that you can expect.\n\n12\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.770\nSo you'll be more prepared to not\nonly take the certification but\n\n13\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.720\nas well as pass it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.120\nSo let's go ahead and talk a little\nbit about What is CompTIA Security+?\n\n15\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.540\nWell, it's actually a benchmark for\n\n16\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.770\nsecurity's best practices and\nIT security systems, right.\n\n17\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.099\nIt is also recognized as\na international certification.\n\n18\n00:00:57.099 --> 00:01:02.230\nIt has ISO 17024 accreditation to it.\n\n19\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.720\nIt's also compliant with the Federal\nInformation Safety Management Act as well\n\n20\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.950\nas well as being recognized\nby Department of Defense.\n\n21\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.150\nIt is a world wide accreditation that\nmeans if you take your certification exam\n\n22\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.320\nhere in let's say the United States,\n\n23\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.830\nit'll be recognized even if you travel\nto other countries and then vice versa.\n\n24\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.300\nNow, who is this accelerated\nSecurity+ certification for?\n\n25\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.650\nWell, this is for\ncandidates that require certification.\n\n26\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.980\nThe other thing to keep in mind is\nthat in the accelerated version,\n\n27\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.950\nthere are some assumed knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.400\nThe candidates will be required to\nunderstand the basic concepts of securing\n\n29\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.220\ninformation systems as well as the\ncandidates who are ready to take the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.830\nSo if you want just some\nof that last minute,\n\n31\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.560\njust rocket rush of information to help\nround off your training before you\n\n32\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.490\nset the certification exam,\nthen this series is for you.\n\n33\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.930\nNow what are some of the things that\nwe could see that will be covered\n\n34\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.370\ninside of Security+?\n\n35\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.750\nWell, we're gonna cover the objectives for\nSY0-501,\n\n36\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.600\nthat is the current exam objectives for\nSecurity+.\n\n37\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.310\nWe'll be looking at some of\nthe fundamental security concepts\n\n38\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.120\nas well as the principles for\nrisk management.\n\n39\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.610\nWe'll also be looking at things like well,\nhost based and\n\n40\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.760\nnetwork based security techniques.\n\n41\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.650\nWe'll be looking at things like\ncompliance and operational standards.\n\n42\n00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.000\nAs well as some other things like for\ninstance,\n\n43\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.450\nwe'll be looking at threats\nvulnerabilities and attacks.\n\n44\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.140\nWe'll be looking at things like technology\nand some of the tools that you will be\n\n45\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.170\nutilizing as you make your\nway into IT security.\n\n46\n00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.310\nWe'll also be looking at\nsecure architecture and\n\n47\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.320\nsecure design followed by things\nlike identity access and management.\n\n48\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.330\nWe'll also be looking at risk management\nas well as cryptology, cryptography,\n\n49\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080\nexcuse me, and\nthe public key infrastructure.\n\n50\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.690\nNow, the last thing we kind\nof want to talk about here is\n\n51\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.360\nwhat are some of the exam details?\n\n52\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.360\nWe don't want you to get in the exam\nbooth and not know what to expect,\n\n53\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.380\nso keep in mind that the exam format is\ngoing to be 90 minutes and 90 questions.\n\n54\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.310\nIt is a multiple choice,\nperformance based exam.\n\n55\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.600\nNow, multiple choice means that you're\ngonna have more than one choice.\n\n56\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.340\nIt could be multiple answers as well,\n\n57\n00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.760\nmeaning more than one answer for\na single question.\n\n58\n00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.860\nPerformance based, think of simulations.\n\n59\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.750\nThat means you might get a couple\nsimulations as well that you\n\n60\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.000\nneed to perform some kind of action,\nwhether it be a drag and\n\n61\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.940\ndrop or a simulation Inside of\nsome kind of security appliance.\n\n62\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.340\nPassing score is going to be 750.\n\n63\n00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.353\n750 and\nthat score range is from 100 to 900.\n\n64\n00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:45.540\nNow in US dollars,\nthe exam currently costs $320.\n\n65\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.820\nIt is recommended that you have CompTIA's\nNet+ certification under your belt and\n\n66\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.500\ntwo years of IT administration experience.\n\n67\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.290\nKeep in mind that it's not a requirement,\n\n68\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.250\nit's not a prerequisite that you must\nhave these to take the Security+ exam.\n\n69\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.530\nBut it is recommended so\nthat you have some of the experience.\n\n70\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.301\nAnd if that is what you are getting into,\nwanting to get certified\n\n71\n00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:11.094\nhere then the accelerated\nCompTIA Security+ series is for you.\n\n72\n00:04:11.094 --> 00:04:16.163\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
