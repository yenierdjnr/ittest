Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.518\nthis is the Access 2016\nEssentials Course overview.\n\n5\n00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:24.469\nAnd in this episode we're going to be\nreviewing well exactly what is this\n\n6\n00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.400\nshow going to be covering.\n\n7\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.270\nWho is this show for?\n\n8\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.460\nDo I need to know anything\nbefore I get started?\n\n9\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.970\nAnd any extra tit bits along the way.\n\n10\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.573\nSo let's talk about topics that we are\ngoing to be covering this is an essential\n\n11\n00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:43.038\nshow, we started at very beginning of\nintroducing different topics within\n\n12\n00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:45.082\nAccess, like what is a database?\n\n13\n00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.470\nWhat does it mean to have a select query?\n\n14\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.166\nHow do I get around\nthe interface of Access?\n\n15\n00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.854\nWell, that's all covered in\nthis introduction topic, or\n\n16\n00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.004\nsection of this particular show.\n\n17\n00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.348\nThen we're gonna go ahead and\nget into creating tables,\n\n18\n00:00:59.348 --> 00:01:03.758\nwhere all of your data is actually\nstored within your Access database.\n\n19\n00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:07.701\nSo we're gonna learn how to create tables,\nhow to import information,\n\n20\n00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.910\nwhether from an Excel file or a CSV file.\n\n21\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.330\nAnd we're also gonna be talking about\nthe relationships that we have between\n\n22\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.080\nour tables.\n\n23\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.800\nVery important key concepts\nabout designing a database.\n\n24\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.857\nThen we're gonna move into creating\nqueries or questions that we're\n\n25\n00:01:23.857 --> 00:01:27.992\ngoing to be asking of our data,\nto be able to pull out that information.\n\n26\n00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:32.507\nAnd within this particular topic,\nwe're also gonna talk about some of\n\n27\n00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:37.323\nthe flaws that we have encountered or\ncreated, some little mistakes that we\n\n28\n00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:41.784\nmade in our database as we were\ndesigning this out and working with it.\n\n29\n00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:45.469\nAnd be able to show you guys some\nof the mistakes we've made so\n\n30\n00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.590\nyou can learn from our mistakes,\nand be able to really solidify that\n\n31\n00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.650\nfoundational knowledge of\nproper database design.\n\n32\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.225\nThen we move into making forms,\nthis is where we could go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:01.710\ninput the information into our database,\ninto our tables, how to create forms.\n\n34\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.502\nWhere we'll talk about controls and\nfields and\n\n35\n00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:07.025\nhow that maps out to our different tables.\n\n36\n00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:10.347\nAnd then we'll get into reporting\nthe data, generating reports,\n\n37\n00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:13.493\nbecause everybody knows that they\nhave that one boss that says,\n\n38\n00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:17.350\ncan you go ahead and give me that\nreport by Friday, that would be great.\n\n39\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.595\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n40\n00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:26.051\nNow this particular show is designated for\na beginner user in Access,\n\n41\n00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:30.674\nor maybe you have no prior\nknowledge of Access at any level,\n\n42\n00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:33.340\nthen this is the show for you.\n\n43\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.170\nAnd I say all Officer users with\na capital O, meaning the Office Suite.\n\n44\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.530\nNot necessarily that you work in an office\nor not, like a physical location, but\n\n45\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.430\nyou are using the Office 365 Suite.\n\n46\n00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.258\nNow a little caveat on this\nparticular product here is that,\n\n47\n00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:54.010\nAccess is a Windows only product.\n\n48\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.120\nThey do not make Office or Access for\nMac, so you will have to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.879\nSo if you're on a Mac,\nyou might wanna go look\n\n50\n00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.946\nat something else on different shows\non how you might wanna use it,\n\n51\n00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:09.744\ncuz there is no equivalent there\nin this particular product.\n\n52\n00:03:09.744 --> 00:03:11.468\nNow the prerequisites like I just said,\n\n53\n00:03:11.468 --> 00:03:13.809\nyou don't have to have any\nprior knowledge of Access.\n\n54\n00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.775\nIf you have some familiarity we say Excel.\n\n55\n00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:20.754\nYou're looking to maybe kinda go from\nExcel to Access then we would have\n\n56\n00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:24.420\nsome familiarity with that\nparticular product which will help.\n\n57\n00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.335\nAnd I actually use a lot of\ncorrelations between this product and\n\n58\n00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:32.790\nExcel because I'm more of an Excel user.\n\n59\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.718\nAnd then Ronnie, who's going to be\nthe person we'll be seeing a lot of,\n\n60\n00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:37.400\nand hearing him tell us all about Access.\n\n61\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.020\nI'll try to make some of\nthose correlations for you.\n\n62\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.758\nBut also having a basic understanding of\nthe Windows environment will be helpful,\n\n63\n00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:48.221\nso you know where the start button is,\nand things like that.\n\n64\n00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.580\nExtra information,\nthere's always other options.\n\n65\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.440\nIf we're right clicking on something,\n\n66\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.100\nyou could also probably double click\nsomewhere else, or there's a button,\n\n67\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.750\nthere's multiple ways to get to the same\nplace, in all of your Office products.\n\n68\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.560\nSo just keep that in mind, and you might\ndevelop one way that you like to go\n\n69\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.880\nto get something rather than\nthe way that we're showing you.\n\n70\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.190\nSo there's always different options,\nand we might not cover them all,\n\n71\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.380\ncuz there's so many of them.\n\n72\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.590\nUpdates happen,\nyes this is a subscription based product,\n\n73\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.220\nif you are using a subscription base.\n\n74\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.090\nOf course, you could have a single,\nstand alone product as well.\n\n75\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.700\nBut if you are on that Office 365\nsubscription, you will have updates.\n\n76\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.992\nAnd by the time that you're watching this\nprogram, you might have some updates on\n\n77\n00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:33.614\nyour application that we didn't\nhave at the time of this recording.\n\n78\n00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:37.720\nThere might be a few things that\nare different here and there.\n\n79\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.398\nSearching for answers, yep there's\ngood old Oracle of the internet,\n\n80\n00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:44.891\nyou can go ahead and search for\nyour answers either through Google or\n\n81\n00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:47.420\nBing, whatever search\nengine that you prefer.\n\n82\n00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.267\nAlso the Microsoft Office help files,\nthey're actually very, very helpful, so\n\n83\n00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:54.720\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n84\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.461\nEverybody uses products differently,\nand that goes the same for Access.\n\n85\n00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:03.034\nSo how we're demonstrating the concept\nof Access with our particular database,\n\n86\n00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:07.500\nmight not be the exact database, or\nthe reasons why you need to use Access.\n\n87\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.028\nBut we do try to take this from\na very foundational level,\n\n88\n00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:14.852\nof being able to explain the core\nconcepts of this project, or\n\n89\n00:05:14.852 --> 00:05:19.060\nthis product, I should say, and\nthat you can be able to translate.\n\n90\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.720\nAnd as always, I always try to tell\nyou all, have some fun with this, or\n\n91\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.740\nat least have fun learning about this.\n\n92\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.770\nWe like to have fun,\nwe like to keep it light, make some jokes.\n\n93\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.920\nMe and\nRonnie have a pretty good rapport there.\n\n94\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.746\nWe've known each other for a long time, so\n\n95\n00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:35.065\nwe like to kinda poke fun at\neach other here and there.\n\n96\n00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:39.549\nSoI hope you have a good time while\nyou're watching these episodes and\n\n97\n00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:43.580\nhopefully, you can have a lot\nof fun with Access for yourself.\n\n98\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.445\nSo I'd like to talk to you guys little bit\nabout how the exercise files are arranged\n\n99\n00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:50.400\nin this particular show.\n\n100\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.712\nIt is slightly different from some of our\nother shows if you've seen like Artcell or\n\n101\n00:05:54.712 --> 00:05:56.573\nWord, it's slightly different.\n\n102\n00:05:56.573 --> 00:06:00.625\nWe do have files that are associated\nwith all of the episodes and\n\n103\n00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.850\nlessons that we go through.\n\n104\n00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.543\nHowever, we don't have the files\nindividually for download on each episode.\n\n105\n00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:14.090\nWe put all of the files for the entire\nshow in this particular course overview.\n\n106\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.090\nSo make sure you go ahead and\ndownload the episode files\n\n107\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.820\nfrom this particular screen that you're\nlooking at and be able to see them.\n\n108\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.300\nSo let me go head and show you and give\nyou a little roadmap of where we're going.\n\n109\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.209\nSo once you download them, they will\nbe a zipped file that you can unzip and\n\n110\n00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.660\nI have a folder right here,\n\n111\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.152\nthat just has all of the files\nthat we're going to be addressing.\n\n112\n00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:38.518\nSome PDFs, some Access files,\nour database files, some Excel files, and\n\n113\n00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:41.877\nI'm like gosh,\nI don't know which ones go with which.\n\n114\n00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:43.650\nWell, just consult the guide.\n\n115\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.782\nAnd I have made this into a PDF,\nand an Excel file.\n\n116\n00:06:48.782 --> 00:06:54.555\nI'm gonna go ahead and open the PDF called\nAccess 2016 Essentials Files Guide.\n\n117\n00:06:54.555 --> 00:07:02.090\nAnd this goes ahead and maps out every\nsingle episode name that we have.\n\n118\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.230\nYou don't really don't have to worry\nabout the numbers this is more for us and\n\n119\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.210\nour internal numbering system.\n\n120\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.720\nBut take the name of the episode, and then\nthe files that are associated with it.\n\n121\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.820\nSo you can see that\nthe Database Terminology pt 2 is\n\n122\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.370\nassociated with the Database Terminology\nwith Notes.pdf, and I have another one\n\n123\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.210\nover here to the side, that will give you\njust a couple of extra notes in there.\n\n124\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.427\nAnd as you can see, this kinda goes\ndown through each one of our episodes.\n\n125\n00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:36.397\nAnd then gives you which files that you\nneed to look for within that folder, and\n\n126\n00:07:36.397 --> 00:07:40.180\nhow they're associated with each other and\nalong the way.\n\n127\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.652\nThere are a few little things I wanted\nto point out that we do have some kinda\n\n128\n00:07:43.652 --> 00:07:46.160\nstopping point, or some kinda checkpoints.\n\n129\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.190\nBecause this is a show that we intend\nto have you watch as a sequence.\n\n130\n00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.290\nSo it goes from show one all the way down,\nor episode one down through.\n\n131\n00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.320\nIf you're picking up on one\nparticular episode individually,\n\n132\n00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.100\nthat's totally fine too.\n\n133\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.750\nJust take notice that some of the episodes\nkind of build off of each other.\n\n134\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.450\nSo somethings that might be\ncovered in the table relationships\n\n135\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.360\nare piggybacking off of our creating\ntables, importing external data.\n\n136\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.685\nSo we do kind of use this,\n\n137\n00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:22.361\nwe talk about them being many\ntheories within this particular show.\n\n138\n00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:28.937\nSo they are meant to be washed within\nlike a whole topic from beginning to end.\n\n139\n00:08:28.937 --> 00:08:33.057\nDo notice that some of the file names\nmight be a little different from one\n\n140\n00:08:33.057 --> 00:08:33.890\nto the other.\n\n141\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.430\nFor example, I have some ones\nthat I have a starting file right\n\n142\n00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.470\nhere in the external data\nof the import and a pen.\n\n143\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.310\nCuz I created that after the episode, so\n\n144\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.214\nyou would have a file\nto follow up on with.\n\n145\n00:08:45.214 --> 00:08:51.230\nBut the file name in the episode,\nmight not match that, and that's okay.\n\n146\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.890\nAnd so you can see that we have to this\npoint, this is where the file ends,\n\n147\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.270\nthen you get into queries.\n\n148\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.790\nAnd then we have kind\nof some extra files and\n\n149\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.990\nup to this point that's where this\nfile will be, and so on and so forth.\n\n150\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.090\nSo, just consult this particular\nguide to go ahead and\n\n151\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.230\nmatch up the different exercise\nfiles to the episodes.\n\n152\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.143\nAnd then just as little note down here\nthat I have for you guys is that,\n\n153\n00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:20.650\nwe did try very hard to make sure\nthat the files do match, okay?\n\n154\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.745\nBut, and sometimes there might have\nlike a couple extra things in there so\n\n155\n00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:28.048\nyou could see there has extra\ndifferent objects compared to\n\n156\n00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:31.570\nthe episode files in the recordings,\nand they should be fine.\n\n157\n00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.747\nYou could see that between filming\nepisodes, we do modify our files here and\n\n158\n00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:38.370\nthere to make sure that\neverything is working.\n\n159\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.157\nAnd then we readjust them to be able\nto have you guys have a starting\n\n160\n00:09:43.157 --> 00:09:45.520\npoint of where to follow along.\n\n161\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.389\nBut just keep in mind that\nthe findings might be different and,\n\n162\n00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:53.185\nsome of the episodes like I said\nbefore they do work off each and\n\n163\n00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:55.457\nI do try to notate in those episodes.\n\n164\n00:09:55.457 --> 00:10:00.512\nFor example right here in our reports\nthat, the reports part four is\n\n165\n00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:05.790\ncontinuing the same example that\nwe started in the part three file.\n\n166\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.525\nSo, just wanted to make a note of that and\nso you all are very aware of that.\n\n167\n00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:13.279\nI've made this guide for you guys so\ngo ahead and download those episodes.\n\n168\n00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.142\nBut that goes ahead and\nwraps up my overview of the course, and\n\n169\n00:10:17.142 --> 00:10:19.460\nthe overview of the exercise files.\n\n170\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.085\nSo I hope to see you very soon,\nand let's have some fun in Access.\n\n171\n00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:29.559\n[MUSIC].\n\n",
