OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.544\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:21.510\nwe are continuing on with our\nAccess 2016 Essentials show.\n\n5\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.970\nIn this episode, we're going to be\ncreating tables, the old-fashioned way,\n\n6\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.625\nmanual data entry.\n\n7\n00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:33.595\n[LAUGH] And here to help us is\nMr Ronnie Wong, hello, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:36.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I am doing fine, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.410\nYeah, it is a little bit difficult\nwith the R and the W there.\n\n10\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.717\nThey tend to juxtapose, and there we go,\nand we have the different name.\n\n11\n00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:44.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, overall though, Vonne,\n\n12\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.480\ngrateful to be here on OfficeProTV as\nwe get started in working with Access.\n\n13\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.990\nAnd the beginning foundation of that,\nof course, is creating tables, okay?\n\n14\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.400\nNow, remember that in previous episodes,\nwe did talk about using templates,\n\n15\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.340\nand they were fine,\nthey'll do exactly what you need to.\n\n16\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.930\nYou don't ever have even to\nworry about creating tables.\n\n17\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.960\nBut once you do that,\nyou also have to start entering in data.\n\n18\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640\nAnd the manual data entry\nis probably going to\n\n19\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.740\nbe the way that it's going to work for\nyou the majority of the time.\n\n20\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.164\nIn other words, you're either gonna be\nmanually typing in the data yourself.\n\n21\n00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:20.699\nOr you're gonna set up Access,\nof course, or\n\n22\n00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:23.120\nsomebody else to enter\ndata into it as well.\n\n23\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.734\nSo we're gonna show you that process and\nhow a database designer would\n\n24\n00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.808\nprobably enter in data, and\nlet's say like, dummy data.\n\n25\n00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:33.506\nSo that we can test out the database and\nsee how it works in the way that we want\n\n26\n00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:37.450\nit to, and verify that all the fields\nare filling in the way that we want.\n\n27\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.840\nAnd if we have to make some adjustments,\nthis is the time to do it,\n\n28\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.460\nbefore we ever put any real production\ndata into our Access database.\n\n29\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.660\nSo testing is a key part of it,\n\n30\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.670\nunderstanding the planning is\nactually going to help you out right.\n\n31\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.830\nThe better that you plan,\n\n32\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.500\nthe less that you have to worry about\nsome of these other issues creeping in\n\n33\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.280\nas you're now gonna work specifically\nwith Access to get started, okay?\n\n34\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.980\nEspecially on creating the tables.\n\n35\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.990\nSo Vonne, that is where we're going.\n\n36\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.480\nWe're gonna head right into Access,\n\n37\n00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.990\nand make sure that we get started here,\nand do what we need to do.\n\n38\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.410\nAnd we'll start and bring in some data and\nsee what happens, all right?\n\n39\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.930\n&gt;&gt; And we're using the table that we\nactually used in our planning episode.\n\n40\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.263\nAll the fields that we determined that we\nneed, we're gonna use that as our baseline\n\n41\n00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:23.205\nfor this particular episode,\nand see where it takes us.\n\n42\n00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.227\n&gt;&gt; And then it's gonna be\nimportant that we do that and\n\n43\n00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:26.550\nthat we understand the process.\n\n44\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.860\nSo we're gonna take it slow\nat this particular point.\n\n45\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.600\nBecause understanding that process and\nmaking sure that it's done\n\n46\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.230\nduring the planning phase, that was kind\nof fun for us as we went through it.\n\n47\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.950\nBut now, we need to understand how do we\nget that and translate it into Access.\n\n48\n00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.410\nAnd then, what are some of\nthe details we need to make sure of.\n\n49\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.650\nAnd then going back through, double\nchecking again that we've met all those\n\n50\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.400\nprinciples, are gonna help us out, too.\n\n51\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.270\n&gt;&gt; So we're probably gonna start\nwith a blank database this time\n\n52\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.100\ninstead of using any of those templates.\n\n53\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.170\nWe're gonna start from scratch and\nthen make our own tables.\n\n54\n00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.450\nIs that step number one?\n\n55\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.120\n&gt;&gt; That is gonna be step number one that\nwe are going to take a look at to do.\n\n56\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.075\nSo let's go ahead and see right here on\nmy desktop, I've selected Access 2016.\n\n57\n00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.610\nFrom this point, you can't just say,\nI'm gonna get started.\n\n58\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.440\nRemember that everything in Access\nreally begins with a template.\n\n59\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.770\nEven a blank database\nthat has nothing in it\n\n60\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.580\nessentially is the basis of what we have.\n\n61\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.840\nAnd, of course,\nchoosing an appropriate database name.\n\n62\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.145\nSo we are gonna call this one, as much\nas I don't want to type this in, okay,\n\n63\n00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:30.563\nDancingDogs.\n\n64\n00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:32.197\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n65\n00:03:32.197 --> 00:03:36.222\n&gt;&gt; DancingDogsinc.\n\n66\n00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:40.924\n[LAUGH] Yes, I actually did type that in,\nand yes, I'm a little less masculine for\n\n67\n00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:42.996\nit at this point, but here we go.\n\n68\n00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:43.886\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna get better too.\n\n69\n00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:44.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n70\n00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.620\nyeah, that's what's scary, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.695\nSo, I'm gonna click OK, and there we go.\n\n72\n00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:54.350\nOkay, so, we have now created\nthe database file itself, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.260\nAnd this is important.\n\n74\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.842\nRemember that Access,\n\n75\n00:03:56.842 --> 00:04:02.313\nit doesn't keep the database in multiple\ndifferent files, as far as 16 parts.\n\n76\n00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:05.110\nAnd you have to worry about each\nof those parts getting corrupted.\n\n77\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.200\nEverything is stored as a single file,\nwhich makes it incredibly portable.\n\n78\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.765\nFrom this point as it remains, actually\nrelatively big or small, I can move it\n\n79\n00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:17.346\nfrom my laptop over to Vonne's laptop\njust by simply copying the file over to.\n\n80\n00:04:17.346 --> 00:04:20.570\nAnd then Vonne can do the thing\nthat she needs to do.\n\n81\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.830\nAnd we are off and ready to go, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.050\nSo once we get to this point and\nwe select that blank template, okay,\n\n83\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.990\nwe're gonna start adding\nin a new object here.\n\n84\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.020\nAnd we got a couple of\nthings that we can do.\n\n85\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.251\nIt gives us by default table number 1.\n\n86\n00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:37.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna say that,\nthat's what it always does when you start\n\n87\n00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:40.425\na new database,\nis that it opens up a blank new Table1.\n\n88\n00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:48.120\nAnd it also, it's opened up in that area\nthat we're calling, that design pane.\n\n89\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.350\nI know it's not design pane, it's just-\n&gt;&gt; This is our data sheet view.\n\n90\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.547\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes, the data sheet view in our\nwork area, we'll just call it that way.\n\n91\n00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:56.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, there are two things.\n\n92\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.399\nWhen we start talking about the idea\nof creating a table manually, you can,\n\n93\n00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:04.420\nand you can see right up here at the top.\n\n94\n00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.880\nIf I don't have anything else,\nand I don't know how to start,\n\n95\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.600\nI can simply take my data and\nstart to enter it in right here, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.010\nNow you might go, well, how do I do that?\n\n97\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.960\nYou just type it in.\n\n98\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.639\nI'm not gonna do this,\nbut you just type it in.\n\n99\n00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.945\nAnd then you move on to the next cell and\nyou move on to the next cell and\n\n100\n00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.170\nyou continually type in the data.\n\n101\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.180\nAnd you can begin building\nyour table that way, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.860\nThey already have what they call their\nown ID field which will be an auto number\n\n103\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.890\nfield to generate just a unique ID for\nyou.\n\n104\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.732\nYou don't really have to do any\nreal designing in that part, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:42.279\nNow once you set that up, you're gonna see\nthat it's gonna generate unusual table\n\n106\n00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.840\nnames for\nyou when you start doing other things.\n\n107\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.410\nSo we are going to control this\nprocess a little bit better.\n\n108\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.510\nAnd the way that we do that, of course,\nis that we're gonna switch the views.\n\n109\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.730\nAnd we're gonna set up the fields that\nwe want to appear in this first table\n\n110\n00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.100\nthat we are gonna call products,\nis what's gonna happen, all right?\n\n111\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.915\nSo the way that we change\nover to the design view,\n\n112\n00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:06.827\nat least the way I'm going to do it,\nis over on the left-hand side,\n\n113\n00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:10.346\nI have the icon for\nthe different View buttons that are here.\n\n114\n00:06:10.346 --> 00:06:12.830\nAnd I'm gonna select Design View.\n\n115\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.850\nAnd once I do this, it's gonna ask,\nwhat do I want the table name to be?\n\n116\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.310\nThe great thing is,\nwe've already set this up and\n\n117\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.899\nwe already went through the process,\nthe planning, so, I'm gonna add in tbl.\n\n118\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.045\nLet me see if I can zoom in as I'm typing\nhere, and unlock my mouse to do this,\n\n119\n00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:34.410\ntblProducts.\n\n120\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.630\nRemember, I've also said this\nin previous episodes as well,\n\n121\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.890\nyou don't have to do it this way,\nbut the convention is simple.\n\n122\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.690\nMake sure that table names are normally\ngonna be named as a plural,\n\n123\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.110\nis what you're actually\ngonna end up seeing here.\n\n124\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.720\nClick OK, and there it is.\n\n125\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.350\nI have now begun and I've created this.\n\n126\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.510\nAnd you see it switched\nthe actual table name.\n\n127\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.850\nNavigation pane is still here.\n\n128\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.560\nI'm gonna take up some of that real\nestate by collapsing the shutter\n\n129\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.850\nbar is what they call it.\n\n130\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.420\nAnd there is the navigation\npane kinda collapsed down so\n\n131\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.630\nit gives us a little bit\nmore room to work with.\n\n132\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.840\nSo let's explore this\nparticular view just for\n\n133\n00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.470\na moment, Vonne,\nbefore we get started here, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.875\nSo, this is where people,\nwhen they're playing around and\n\n135\n00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:19.949\nthey haven't gotten any kind of pointer or\ndirection about doing this,\n\n136\n00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.719\nthey may think that this is where\nthey start adding in data, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:25.656\nWhy?\nIt looks a bit like Excel, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:25.656 --> 00:07:28.857\nAnd don't me get wrong, there's not\nthousands of columns or anything,\n\n139\n00:07:28.857 --> 00:07:32.100\nit looks like three columns and\nyou start adding in information.\n\n140\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.158\nAnd all of a sudden,\nyou get to the second field and\n\n141\n00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:36.418\nyou realize you can't add\nin anything really, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:36.418 --> 00:07:39.440\nAnd that's because this field\nactually includes a drop down.\n\n143\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.610\nSo now you're a little bit more\nstunned and then you realize, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.059\nSo what are we doing here in the Design\nView as we're setting up the structure for\n\n145\n00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:46.583\nthe table?\n\n146\n00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:50.237\nWe're essentially going to assign\nunderneath the field name here,\n\n147\n00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.634\nremember that fields means columns, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:52.634 --> 00:07:56.238\nWe're gonna set those names up\nover here on the left-hand side,\n\n149\n00:07:56.238 --> 00:07:58.211\nis what's gonna end up happening.\n\n150\n00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.582\nThen you also want a data type.\n\n151\n00:08:00.582 --> 00:08:03.483\nNotice on the right-hand side,\nit gives you a description and\n\n152\n00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.450\nit says optional, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.440\nIf you do this and you know that\nmultiple people are possibly going to be\n\n154\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.440\nworking on the infrastructure of your\ndatabase, in other words, the design and\n\n155\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.890\nadding in stuff, the more information\nyou can include at the beginning,\n\n156\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.245\nespecially in the description,\nis going to help.\n\n157\n00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:23.150\nThey're not going to wonder why\ndid you put this field in here?\n\n158\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.530\nWhat is this about?\n\n159\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.620\nAdding in those descriptions\nare really helpful at times,\n\n160\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.470\nespecially when you have tons of fields.\n\n161\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.150\nAnd you know that you have to actually\nmanage and do and you keep them separated.\n\n162\n00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.370\nYou end up seeing that some people\nactually have two or three tables.\n\n163\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.391\nAnd for one reason or another,\nthey name the table or\n\n164\n00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:42.596\nthe fields almost identical, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:42.596 --> 00:08:45.661\nAnd each of those tables, they've\nnamed them exactly the same thing and\n\n166\n00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:49.040\nhere it gives you a chance to make sure\nthat you specify exactly what you need to.\n\n167\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.700\nBut that field is not super important and\nthat's why they call it optional.\n\n168\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.450\nI like it because it really does help me\nto go back and I can look at design view\n\n169\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.030\nand logically, I can work out why\nthat field is in that table, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.460\nSo simply, when we start here, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.680\nI've got a couple of things that\nI can do at this point, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.820\nWhich is, I can accept the default\nID field which it generated and\n\n173\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.790\nthen the auto number.\n\n174\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.194\nI can also rename this one if I want to.\n\n175\n00:09:15.194 --> 00:09:18.840\nNow Vonne, since we actually did\ncreate the data, did we actually\n\n176\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.390\ndo an auto number or did we actually\nchoose our own ID, do you remember?\n\n177\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.660\n&gt;&gt; We decided that we were.\n\n178\n00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.866\nWe're on the products, right?\n\n179\n00:09:24.866 --> 00:09:26.409\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well we wanted to have\n\n180\n00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:27.880\nthe item number.\n\n181\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.256\nAnd that's also like on the record that\nwe're looking at, there's like that little\n\n182\n00:09:32.256 --> 00:09:35.983\nkey off to the side, so they were\nalready designated as the primary key.\n\n183\n00:09:35.983 --> 00:09:36.902\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n184\n00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:40.812\n&gt;&gt; And since we know that the primary\nkey is that unique identifier,\n\n185\n00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:43.900\nthen we would want to have\nthat as the item number.\n\n186\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.062\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep.\n\n187\n00:09:45.062 --> 00:09:47.962\nSo you've got a couple of things\nthat we can do here on this primary\n\n188\n00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.080\nkey value as well.\n\n189\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.875\nSo let me do this.\n\n190\n00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.041\nSo let me kind of get\nrid of this right now.\n\n191\n00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:54.068\nAnd then, let's see.\n\n192\n00:09:55.217 --> 00:09:56.360\nYeah, we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n193\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.266\nAnd we'll set our own primary key, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:00.090\nSo that way we're not\ngonna confuse anybody.\n\n195\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.203\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nBut it's also good to point out that\n\n196\n00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:03.431\nif you are using that.\n\n197\n00:10:03.431 --> 00:10:07.240\nLike okay, we start a new database and now\nI'm gonna go ahead and start designing it.\n\n198\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.279\nIf you put first name,\n\n199\n00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.576\nthey're thinking like well the first\nthing I want is a first name.\n\n200\n00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:14.041\nAnd if I was doing like the employees,\n\n201\n00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:18.160\nthey already determined that\nas the primary key by default.\n\n202\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.610\nSo just being aware of, okay, either keep.\n\n203\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.060\nThis is going to be the primary key and\nput the primary key in there.\n\n204\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.266\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or like you're saying, delete it,\n\n205\n00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:27.918\nstart from scratch scratch.\n\n206\n00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:31.619\nBecause maybe your brain hasn't gotten\nkind of in that logical order and\n\n207\n00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:33.266\nthen designate after the fact.\n\n208\n00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:34.368\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is what we're going to\n\n209\n00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:34.932\ngo ahead and do.\n\n210\n00:10:34.932 --> 00:10:37.950\n&gt;&gt; You know, and that makes a little bit\nmore sense for us, because we don't want\n\n211\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.090\npeople to get confused, like I got to\nleave it there because it's there.\n\n212\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.770\nNotice I deleted it right out and\nI'm not so concerned about that.\n\n213\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.180\nSo we're gonna set this\none up as being ItemNumber\n\n214\n00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.810\nis what we're gonna set\nthis one up as being.\n\n215\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.860\nThen on the Data Type here, because\nthis is actually gonna be a number,\n\n216\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.580\nwe've got a couple of choices\nthat we can do for the Data Type.\n\n217\n00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.140\nNow when we start to take a look\nat this idea on the item number,\n\n218\n00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.760\nI'm gonna actually set this\none up as being a short text.\n\n219\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.360\nNow it is a number, but Vonne, I'm\nactually setting this up as being text.\n\n220\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat kinda confused me as well,\n\n221\n00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:16.500\nbecause I was like well,\nif it's maybe like item number 001.\n\n222\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.099\nBut that's a number, so why wouldn't\nwe designate this as a number?\n\n223\n00:11:21.099 --> 00:11:22.512\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But this is.\n\n224\n00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:26.010\nI'm correlating it back to Excel of, well,\n\n225\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.994\nI have section numbers for\ncourses, but it has like the 001.\n\n226\n00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:34.060\nSo I have to designate that as\ntext to keep the preceding 0s.\n\n227\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.584\nAnd the other thing is I'm not using\nthat section number as a number to\n\n228\n00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:40.463\ncalculate something else.\n\n229\n00:11:40.463 --> 00:11:42.753\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n230\n00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:43.827\n&gt;&gt; It really is gonna treat it as text.\n\n231\n00:11:43.827 --> 00:11:45.450\n&gt;&gt; An identifier, right.\n\n232\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.980\n&gt;&gt; So is that kind of correlating here\nas to why we would want to use that,\n\n233\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.640\nthe short text?\n\n234\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah.\n\n235\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.810\nAnd you're exactly right here.\n\n236\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.095\nWe're not using this to\ncalculate some other value,\n\n237\n00:11:56.095 --> 00:12:00.080\nit's not gonna be included in a formula or\na calculation anywhere.\n\n238\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.668\nThis particular field on our item number\nis gonna be strictly for identification\n\n239\n00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:08.657\nand really, even more specifically\nthan that, for the primary key.\n\n240\n00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:14.741\nSo over on the right hand side, I might\ngo ahead and type in primary key, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.450\nFor this table.\n\n242\n00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.721\nNow if I want to set this up\nthough as the primary key.\n\n243\n00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.260\nLet me move to another field.\n\n244\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.630\nNotice that I don't have that key\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n245\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.402\nIf I select that entire row,\nI can then hover up here and\n\n246\n00:12:29.402 --> 00:12:34.010\nthat actually does become active,\nI guess is what it becomes.\n\n247\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.228\nAnd this one's actually\nkind of grayish looking.\n\n248\n00:12:36.228 --> 00:12:40.190\nIn previous editions, it used to be a gold\nKey is what it actually used to be.\n\n249\n00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.970\nSo notice that as I hover over that,\ndesignate the selected field or\n\n250\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.170\nfields, as the primary key.\n\n251\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.460\nSo if I select that, now notice\nthat in the icon, it changed and\n\n252\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.780\nit added in that particular number.\n\n253\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.550\nAnd this means that I\nalso have to make sure\n\n254\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.600\nthat I keep these item numbers as\nbeing unique all the way down.\n\n255\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.050\nIf I do not, if I accidentally type in\nthe same number, it's going to balk\n\n256\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.230\nat me as I do the manual data entry and\nsay, hey, you can't do this.\n\n257\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.940\nThis is a primary key field.\n\n258\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.110\nYou can't have duplicates\nin this primary key field.\n\n259\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.723\nBecause even if all the rest\nof the fields match,\n\n260\n00:13:16.723 --> 00:13:20.042\nthis particular field should\nnever actually be identical and\n\n261\n00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:23.197\nthat's what gives us the unique\nitem number that we want.\n\n262\n00:13:23.197 --> 00:13:24.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat also comes in the planning.\n\n263\n00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:28.185\nIt's like you don't want to put\nthe first name as the primary key.\n\n264\n00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:30.905\nBecause there could be\nmore than one Vonne.\n\n265\n00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:32.460\nIt's pretty rare.\n\n266\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.835\n[LAUGH] Especially with my spelling, so.\n\n267\n00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:36.788\nBut that's something that you always,\nthat's the whole planning process and\n\n268\n00:13:36.788 --> 00:13:37.411\nthose are item numbers.\n\n269\n00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:39.015\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n270\n00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:42.909\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be our first field that\nwe're creating in this design view of our\n\n271\n00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:44.502\ntable using that terminology.\n\n272\n00:13:44.502 --> 00:13:46.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there you go.\n\n273\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now along with this, right?\n\n274\n00:13:48.108 --> 00:13:51.971\nEvery field also is gonna have\nwhat we cal field properties,\n\n275\n00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:57.470\nwhich is directly underneath that table\nthat you see right up here at the top.\n\n276\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.711\nNow this is gonna be important,\nbecause as we look over here on the.\n\n277\n00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:05.676\nWell, underneath, you'll actually notice\nthat there's quite a few different\n\n278\n00:14:05.676 --> 00:14:08.630\nproperties that we can take\na look at as well, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.700\nWhen we selected that short text field,\nit limited the field size for us.\n\n280\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.220\nThen, we can also have where\nwe can include in a format.\n\n281\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.196\nNow the reason why I'm\nexpanding this out or\n\n282\n00:14:20.196 --> 00:14:23.098\nzooming out is because\nI can type in stuff.\n\n283\n00:14:23.098 --> 00:14:26.960\nBut notice over here on the right\nhand side just a little bit.\n\n284\n00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.180\nLet me see if I can zoom in and see that.\n\n285\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.027\nIt's actually a drop down or\nit builds in here, okay?\n\n286\n00:14:33.027 --> 00:14:37.420\nSo you can actually add in some other\nthings in there from different components.\n\n287\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.968\nWell, I thought it was drop down,\nI'm lying to you.\n\n288\n00:14:39.968 --> 00:14:40.790\nWhy can't I click on it?\n\n289\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.360\nIt's not letting me click on it.\n\n290\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.910\nLet me try that again.\n\n291\n00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:44.744\nI just had it.\n\n292\n00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.046\nI right clicked on it by accident.\n\n293\n00:14:48.046 --> 00:14:50.670\nSo this-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that one set me off.\n\n295\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.110\nIt actually does have a drop down, you can\nsee it, but there's nothing listed there.\n\n296\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.890\nDo you see that?\nIt's kind of zoomed in, and there it is.\n\n297\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.301\nSee that kind of-\n&gt;&gt; That is the drop down.\n\n298\n00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.530\n&gt;&gt; That is the drop down, yeah.\n\n299\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.874\n&gt;&gt; I'm like wait,\nare you highlighting the next row?\n\n300\n00:15:05.874 --> 00:15:09.624\n[CROSSTALK] That was throwing me off too.\n\n301\n00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:11.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthis one was getting me a little bit.\n\n302\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.181\nBut, it's actually saying that I can put\nwhatever format that I want in here at\n\n303\n00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:14.720\nthis point.\n\n304\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.455\nI'm not gonna include any formatting in,\nbut this is where we can go back and\n\n305\n00:15:17.455 --> 00:15:20.050\nwe're doing like telephone numbers and\nwanting all that other stuff.\n\n306\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.942\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, this is like cell\nformatting and number formats in Excel.\n\n307\n00:15:22.942 --> 00:15:23.650\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n308\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.950\n&gt;&gt; Like if I wanted to have three\ncharacters, then a dash, and\n\n309\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.360\nthen three more characters.\n\n310\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.990\nI mean,\nthat would be something like in Excel,\n\n311\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.010\nwe would do like 000-000\nto accept numbers.\n\n312\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.140\nAnd the preceding zero.\n\n313\n00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.870\nSo it's along those lines.\n\n314\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.586\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n315\n00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:42.770\nOr you know, it could be,\nonce again, we have the field size.\n\n316\n00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.590\nWe have format.\n\n317\n00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.270\nBut like on the telephone number\nspecifically, notice it says input mask.\n\n318\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.756\nAnd that's what we're specifically\nreferring to now on that one.\n\n319\n00:15:49.756 --> 00:15:53.396\nSo both of those can help play in that\nas well, but if I click on this one,\n\n320\n00:15:53.396 --> 00:15:57.429\nthere's an ellipses button, and now it\nsays you have to save the table first.\n\n321\n00:15:57.429 --> 00:16:02.153\nSo it's just saying you've already done\nsomething Let me save that table now.\n\n322\n00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:04.421\nAnd then let's see if I\ncan click on there we go.\n\n323\n00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:08.120\nOkay, and this is that wizard that\nallows us to set this up as two.\n\n324\n00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.700\nOkay, so you do have formatting in\nthere and they're done showing things.\n\n325\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.970\nSo there is nothing actually\nin that formatting field.\n\n326\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.350\nBut this one is the input mass\nthat you were just talking about.\n\n327\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.200\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually more\nlike the Excel format.\n\n328\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or back in Excel.\n\n329\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n330\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.350\n&gt;&gt; But so\none would use input mask or format?\n\n331\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or both?\n\n332\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.920\n&gt;&gt; You can actually use both if you choose\nto, but normally if it's something that\n\n333\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.140\nyou want to restrict,\nit's going to be using the input max.\n\n334\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.890\nOn the formatting,\nit may just be about personal size or\n\n335\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.920\nfont or something like that.\n\n336\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.900\nThat's possible.\n\n337\n00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.830\nYou can also add in captions for\neach of the fields here,\n\n338\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.700\nwhich we are not going to\nworry about right now.\n\n339\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.980\n&gt;&gt; A caption would be like a caption for\npeople entering the data.\n\n340\n00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:49.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n341\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.810\n&gt;&gt; A tool tip.\n\n342\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n\n343\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.789\n&gt;&gt; So you hover over it and like enter\nin this particular type of value,\n\n344\n00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:56.425\nor don't mess with this value.\n\n345\n00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:59.560\n[LAUGH] That may actually\nbe more key than anything.\n\n346\n00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.960\nOr if you have a drop down say\nyou must choose yes or no.\n\n347\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.220\n&gt;&gt; This is like uncorrelated\ndata validation in Excel,\n\n348\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.160\nto where you're controlling how\npeople will be putting information.\n\n349\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAt least this will\n\n350\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.160\ngive you that caption and hint to do so.\n\n351\n00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.300\nBut there are other things down here which\nwe'll probably get into more in towards\n\n352\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.720\nthe advanced stuff inside\nof access as well.\n\n353\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.540\nWhat Vaughn was talking about, validation\nrules and text as well as default values.\n\n354\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.940\nThere are some times where,\nas far as with the default values,\n\n355\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.490\nyou don't want it to show as being blank\nbecause people don't know what it is.\n\n356\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.390\nBut you might would say, hey, I want it\nto show up as a zero, or I want you to\n\n357\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.350\nactually start with the number that\nI would start with, which is ten.\n\n358\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.440\nWhatever that value is,\n\n359\n00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.560\nif you want that to be in there, you can\nstart with the default value instead.\n\n360\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.340\n&gt;&gt; Or it could be something that maybe 85%\nof the time you're always gonna have this\n\n361\n00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.500\nand then only the 15%.\n\n362\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.700\nSo why don't you go ahead and\nget the default?\n\n363\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.740\nBut I guess that could cause some\nissues if somebody didn't change it.\n\n364\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n365\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.420\n&gt;&gt; So there, kind of weigh the options.\n\n366\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n367\n00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.840\nSo there's a few other things down here,\nwe're not going to get into it,\n\n368\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.945\nbecause it starts to get into a little bit\nmore technical stuff, like IME code and\n\n369\n00:18:06.945 --> 00:18:10.500\ncenus mode, and stuff like that, and I'm\nperfectly fine with leaving that alone.\n\n370\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.600\nThe only way that you do\nwant to be concerned here,\n\n371\n00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.370\nis with the indexing as well.\n\n372\n00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.380\nSuggest and no duplicates.\n\n373\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.634\nOkay, if you're indexing this,\nyou're saying to allow for\n\n374\n00:18:19.634 --> 00:18:22.850\nit to actually create\nan index of something, okay.\n\n375\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.410\nAnd that means gonna store enough\ninformation in RAM when you bring it up\n\n376\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.980\nthat you can quickly research for\nyour data.\n\n377\n00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.529\nNotice this one doesn't allow for\nduplicate here, okay, is actually what it\n\n378\n00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.754\ndoesn't allow for, but you can also\ndo one where it actually allows for\n\n379\n00:18:36.754 --> 00:18:39.200\nduplicate as well, but\ngenerally we don't, okay.\n\n380\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.040\nSo if you don't want to,\n\n381\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.120\nnotice this is the default values\nthat you're seeing right here.\n\n382\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.720\nRequired, yes, zero length,\nyes, it allowed for that.\n\n383\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.130\nIndexed, yes, so all these other\nones are just default values and\n\n384\n00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.130\nwe're perfectly happy with\nleaving those default values.\n\n385\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.410\nAs far as the Field Size,\n\n386\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.030\nreally the field value that we wanna take\na look at is right here under field size.\n\n387\n00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.420\nNotice it says 255, and\nin binary that's 8 bits.\n\n388\n00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.190\nNow to you and\nme that doesn't really mean much, but\n\n389\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.600\nit's about the amount of storage that we\nactually are gonna add in to that file.\n\n390\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.910\nNow 8 bits of zeroes is still 8 bits.\n\n391\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:20.950\nSo, what we can do is that we can\nchange this down to another size and\n\n392\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:25.620\nthat way we're only storing only let's say\n4 bits if we choose to instead or 6 bits,\n\n393\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.610\nor whatever it might be.\n\n394\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:31.420\nAnd that way we eliminate some of\nthe volume even in zeros and do that.\n\n395\n00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.560\nAnd at this point for us and\n\n396\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.910\nthe number of records we're doing,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n397\n00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.583\nBut if we were concerned about the size,\neven eliminating or\n\n398\n00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.390\nlimiting that is gonna help.\n\n399\n00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.446\nSo someone doesn't just come in,\nand Vaughn and\n\n400\n00:19:43.446 --> 00:19:48.260\nI've seen this happen as well,\nwhere they run across that value and\n\n401\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.730\ngo, it's not accepting the number\nthat I think it should be.\n\n402\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.946\nSo they just make up a number like\n\n403\n00:19:52.946 --> 00:19:53.523\n9999 [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n404\n00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:55.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just type it in.\n\n405\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.540\nWell we can essentially eliminate that\nwith some of the other things, but\n\n406\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.500\nat least the size,\nit will actually remain the same.\n\n407\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're talking about storage\nsize as well, that this kind of what we're\n\n408\n00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.280\ntalking about optimizing graphics\nin web design or anything.\n\n409\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.380\nSo you don't need all this large file\nsize, cuz you want page load and\n\n410\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.380\neverything, so it's just optimizing\nin a couple different senses.\n\n411\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.230\nIf, like you say, if it's an important\naspect of a really large database.\n\n412\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.850\nOur example, eh, okay.\n\n413\n00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not so much,\ncuz we're not really using, if we and\n\n414\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.060\nwe were going to 100,000\nrows yes might start to see\n\n415\n00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.700\nsome performance degradation\non stuff like this.\n\n416\n00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.340\nLet's continue on here and we'll actually\nadd in here our next item as well.\n\n417\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.460\nWe'll start off with item name.\n\n418\n00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:45.450\nWith the item name, this is where I can\nleave it at that 255 depending on the name\n\n419\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:51.360\nand the item that I have, I think 255\nis fair so I can just call this one\n\n420\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.470\nproduct name itself which is perfectly\nfine for me and a short text.\n\n421\n00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.530\nThe other one is the description\nwhich is also talked about as well.\n\n422\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.070\nNow because of the way that we\nwere talking about it a little bit\n\n423\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.810\nago in another episode,\nnotice we have Short Text and\n\n424\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.620\nLong Text as our possible\ndata type values.\n\n425\n00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.020\nThe reason why this one's important is\nbecause in Long Text, it really instead of\n\n426\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.990\nlisting the number of characters\nthat you can really use, okay, which\n\n427\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.660\nis what we'd have here, it actually says\nhere's how much space you can use instead.\n\n428\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.240\nIt's really neat.\n\n429\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I also saw on that field\nproperties down below like the 255 from\n\n430\n00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.550\nthe short text that to the long text\nit actually changed down there.\n\n431\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.860\nSo maybe some of the properties of\nthe data type, it's gonna change on there.\n\n432\n00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.400\nSo you can kind of look at those things\nas you're going through everything.\n\n433\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, as you start to see\nthat and notice that it is no longer\n\n434\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.520\nabout the field size so\nif I click on item name up here.\n\n435\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.550\nNotice it says field size.\n\n436\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.440\nThis time that essentially eliminates\nthat field size at all and\n\n437\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.230\nallows you to do that.\n\n438\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.760\nAnd it just starts off with\nthe idea of formatting up here.\n\n439\n00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.850\n&gt;&gt; And I also see some other\nthings that they required.\n\n440\n00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.460\nIt says like it's not required.\n\n441\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.380\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So those are all different default\n\n442\n00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.140\nfield properties for every data type.\n\n443\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.710\n&gt;&gt; Right, now the value that I\nwant to change here though, okay?\n\n444\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.770\nIf I take a look at this, especially\nwith something like a description,\n\n445\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:22.850\nis the one that we see down here at\nthe end, which is append only, okay?\n\n446\n00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.520\nYou want to be careful with this one, too.\n\n447\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.500\nSo after you actually have everything\nentered in, if you select Append Only,\n\n448\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.100\nit means you can't create\na new description.\n\n449\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.640\nYou can only add to\nthe current description.\n\n450\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.470\nSo notice right here if you select Yes,\nthat will only allow you to add to it.\n\n451\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.380\nSo you can't change.\n\n452\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.650\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't edit it.\n\n453\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.380\nYou couldn't change like if\nsomebody's typed in blue and\n\n454\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.960\nit really was supposed to be red.\n\n455\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.450\nYou just have to say,\nnever mind that it said blue.\n\n456\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.480\nIt's supposed to be red or\nI might flip this.\n\n457\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.600\n&gt;&gt; But I made the same thing, okay.\n\n458\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.170\nSo, you do wanna be careful here.\n\n459\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.490\nSo, we're not gonna change this one\ncuz we do want the ability to edit and\n\n460\n00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.610\ndo some things but you may not.\n\n461\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.050\nYou might say hey.\n\n462\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.780\nWe're gonna use this let's\nsay like as a customer\n\n463\n00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.790\ntype of field where we enter in notes,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.520\nFor that particular customer,\nwe don't want somebody to go in and\n\n465\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.470\nchange those notes and edit it saying,\nBrian did a poor performance.\n\n466\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.800\nAnd I can look at it and\ngo ooh, let me edit that out and\n\n467\n00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.850\nsay Vaughn-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.000\n&gt;&gt; Instead.\n\n469\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.710\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I\n\n470\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.210\nknow-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n471\n00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.990\n&gt;&gt; But you get the idea.\n\n472\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.530\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n473\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.100\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good example.\n\n474\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.340\n&gt;&gt; So if they enter that in then\n\n475\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.620\nit means Ronnie can't go in and\n\n476\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.490\ngo, Vonne needs this review instead,\nclick, click, click, there you go, okay?\n\n477\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.790\nAnd it changes it and there you go.\n\n478\n00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.900\nSo append only maybe some of\nyou choose to but it may not.\n\n479\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.040\nOkay, now let's finish up this table here,\nso the good thing is,\n\n480\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.400\nI chose one that's relatively short.\n\n481\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:48.243\nUnit price is the other one and\nfrom this point here, on the unit price,\n\n482\n00:23:48.243 --> 00:23:52.225\nthis is where we can choose\nbetween currency and numbers.\n\n483\n00:23:52.225 --> 00:23:55.463\nNow, I like the idea of\nunit prices being currency.\n\n484\n00:23:55.463 --> 00:23:59.896\nWhen I do that, notice once again, there\nit is, the field properties did change.\n\n485\n00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:02.947\nAnd what you may also want to do here,\nof course depending on where\n\n486\n00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:06.440\nyou are in the world, is to change\nwhere the decimal values go in.\n\n487\n00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.620\nThis one is set to auto, but\nnotice how many places you can see this.\n\n488\n00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.760\nWhich is zero through 14, or\nautomatically whatever your currency is.\n\n489\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.380\nMost of the time your currency\nit's two decimal places.\n\n490\n00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.480\nThat's what you end up with.\n\n491\n00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.190\nIf you're ever unsure,\nyou can manually set this to 2.\n\n492\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.900\nThat way, you go, I wanna make\nsure that it doesn't ever change.\n\n493\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.490\nI can set that one to two if I want to.\n\n494\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.200\nThat will help us out as well.\n\n495\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.510\nThis one doesn't have\nas many fields with it.\n\n496\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.860\nThat will end up working for\nus in what we want.\n\n497\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.910\nWe also have category.\n\n498\n00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.147\nIs that right, category?\n\n499\n00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.680\nYes, okay.\n\n500\n00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.860\nI don't know why I want to put an a-\n&gt;&gt; I always do.\n\n501\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n502\n00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.150\nI had to start saying it's cate, category.\n\n503\n00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:49.720\nYeah.\n\n504\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.050\nAnd so in my brain, I know to put\nthe e as a cata, no it's cate, cate.\n\n505\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.365\nSo those little thing that\nhelp me spell correctly.\n\n506\n00:24:57.365 --> 00:25:00.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the other, we actually are gonna\n\n507\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.700\nadd in one since that's the way\nthat our data actually turned out.\n\n508\n00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.300\nEven though in our Finding stage,\nwe didn't add in this one.\n\n509\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.100\nWe also wanted SubCategory.\n\n510\n00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.660\n&gt;&gt; And that's where we talk\nabout the data normalization,\n\n511\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.270\nif we had a lot of subcategories\nto separate it out.\n\n512\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.540\nBut since we're only gonna have a few,\nwe're okay for this exam.\n\n513\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure,\nthat will end up working for us too.\n\n514\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.110\nOnce we get that done,\nthen we can go into Manufacturer.\n\n515\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.430\nI can't spell, manufacture,\nor type very easily.\n\n516\n00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.040\nThat will eliminate that one for us.\n\n517\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.800\nAnd then, let's see.\n\n518\n00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.550\nWhat else do I have?\n\n519\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.531\nThat looks like, that's everything.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's it, yeah.\n\n520\n00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.087\n&gt;&gt; Cool, okay.\n\n521\n00:25:35.087 --> 00:25:39.936\nSo, once we've gotten that all done,\nyou normally then would just go back and\n\n522\n00:25:39.936 --> 00:25:42.581\nverify the data type\nis good that you want,\n\n523\n00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:46.670\nthat everything is set up\nthe way you actually want to do.\n\n524\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.370\nOnce that's done, I simply change\nback over to the Datasheet view.\n\n525\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.862\nI am going to the View [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's good that is warning us there,\n\n526\n00:25:56.862 --> 00:25:59.080\nto say, hey,\nare you sure you wanna move on?\n\n527\n00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.670\nWell, if you do, you gotta Save.\n\n528\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.510\nSo that's good, good good.\n\n529\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.420\n&gt;&gt; So, here is the manual process,\nwhich is fairly easy.\n\n530\n00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.380\nYou can start off at this point and\n[LAUGH] let's see,\n\n531\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.728\nwhich one are we gonna choose here.\n\n532\n00:26:10.728 --> 00:26:13.990\nAll right, Vonne, let's take a look at\nour list here just for a moment and\n\n533\n00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.560\nwe're gonna enter in something.\n\n534\n00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.450\nYou've been talking about tutus all day,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n535\n00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.230\nenter in a product here for tutus.\n\n536\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.100\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna have,\nhow about we put our small purple tutu.\n\n537\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.236\n&gt;&gt; Small purple tutu.\n\n538\n00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:32.105\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and our item number is CL-2397.\n\n539\n00:26:32.105 --> 00:26:34.472\n&gt;&gt; 2397, okay.\n\n540\n00:26:34.472 --> 00:26:41.362\nAnd then the item name is\nSmall Purple [LAUGH] Tutu.\n\n541\n00:26:41.362 --> 00:26:42.340\nTutu.\n\n542\n00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.758\nAnd the description-\n&gt;&gt; I'll read the description\n\n543\n00:26:45.758 --> 00:26:46.420\nthere for you Ronnie.\n\n544\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n\n545\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.120\nYou do that.\n\n546\n00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.750\nSure.\n\n547\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.560\n&gt;&gt; Dress up your pooch for\nany fancy occasion.\n\n548\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Your pooch for any fancy occasion.\n\n549\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Dress up, yep.\n\n550\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.550\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n551\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.950\nAlright, neat.\n\n552\n00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:07.562\nUnit price for\nour tutus are gonna be, what is?\n\n553\n00:27:07.562 --> 00:27:08.570\n&gt;&gt; $6.\n&gt;&gt; $6 for a tutu.\n\n554\n00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.320\nThere we go.\n\n555\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.250\nNotice I didn't have to type in\nsix zero zero because we chose\n\n556\n00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.650\nthe formatting for us.\n\n557\n00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:15.530\nWe are ready to go.\n\n558\n00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.650\nAnd the category?\n\n559\n00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.480\n&gt;&gt; Clothing.\n\n560\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.530\n&gt;&gt; Clothing for dogs.\n\n561\n00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey it's a huge industry.\n\n562\n00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.460\nYou know how much stuff is out\nthere to dress up your dogs?\n\n563\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.710\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n564\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No I really don't [LAUGH].\n\n565\n00:27:29.192 --> 00:27:30.100\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n[LAUGH]\n\n566\n00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.610\n&gt;&gt; There really is, okay.\n\n567\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.280\nAnd then we have sub category,\nthis is a costume.\n\n568\n00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.230\nAll right, Vonne.\n\n569\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.630\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I mean we have other types.\n\n570\n00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:42.110\nI mean, you have shirts,\nyou probably have some pants.\n\n571\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.380\n&gt;&gt; You have pants, dog pants.\n\n572\n00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:44.950\nAre you joking?\n\n573\n00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.845\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well maybe I might be\nstretching that one a little.\n\n574\n00:27:47.845 --> 00:27:50.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got me there on that one.\n\n575\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.890\nAnd the last one here is\ngonna be our manufacturer.\n\n576\n00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:54.460\n&gt;&gt; The manufacturer.\n\n577\n00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and this is Toto's tutus [LAUGH].\n\n578\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:02.018\n&gt;&gt; I had so\nmuch fun making these things up for you.\n\n579\n00:28:02.018 --> 00:28:03.064\n[LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:28:03.064 --> 00:28:04.580\n&gt;&gt; Toto's Tutu [LAUGH].\n\n581\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.725\nYes, I have lost a bit of my humanity\nin actually typing this in, okay.\n\n582\n00:28:09.725 --> 00:28:10.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n583\n00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.000\nNow I just hit Tab, and\nnotice it's already accepted the record.\n\n584\n00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.020\nI take a look down here at the bottom.\n\n585\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.560\nIt says 2 of 2 records,\n\n586\n00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.920\nbecause it's expecting me to\ngo on to that second record.\n\n587\n00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.250\nAnd as I continue to enter this data in,\nit will allow me to do this.\n\n588\n00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.540\nNow, just one caveat in here,\n\n589\n00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.700\ncuz I know we're at the end of\ntime as we start doing this, okay?\n\n590\n00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.790\nThis is fine.\n\n591\n00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.550\nAs we start to do this we're gonna\nenter in more actually between shows so\n\n592\n00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.800\nthat we can do some\ntesting that we need to.\n\n593\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.070\nBut this is ultimately not the way\nyou're gonna do this once you set it up\n\n594\n00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.030\nin production.\n\n595\n00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.500\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do forms aren't we, Ronnie?\n\n596\n00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.129\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do forms, once we get\nto that point where we do forms.\n\n597\n00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.070\nAnd we'll see the reason why, but that's\nthe way that you'll actually want to do\n\n598\n00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.480\nthe data entry and you're gonna want\npeople to do the data entry for you.\n\n599\n00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.640\nBut here you can see this is where\nyou can enter in the dummy data and\n\n600\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.560\nthat way get it tested, get it working,\nget it the way that you want to.\n\n601\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.850\nAnd if it's not working,\n\n602\n00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.420\nthe great thing is you're actually only\nentering in dummy data at this point,\n\n603\n00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.600\ngo back into the design view, change up,\nadd in fields as you need to.\n\n604\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.080\nAnd then start again,\nverify that it's actually working.\n\n605\n00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.160\nBut there is a manual process here for\nus doing it.\n\n606\n00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.190\nSo if we wanted to, we could just start by\nsimply typing in the data sheet view, and\n\n607\n00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.970\njust let it go.\n\n608\n00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.093\nChoose all the defaults,\ngo in later on, and then try and\n\n609\n00:29:27.093 --> 00:29:29.140\nchange the defaults, okay?\n\n610\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.000\nBut at this point, learning that\ndesign view, adding in those fields,\n\n611\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.960\nadding in some of\nthe descriptions in there,\n\n612\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.010\nchanging some of those field properties\nwill at least help you to get started.\n\n613\n00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.040\nAnd of course, that means we'll\nactually have to do this for\n\n614\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.510\nthe rest of our database and\nget all those tables added in there.\n\n615\n00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.940\nAnd when they do, ultimately it's gonna\nshow up over on the left hand side\n\n616\n00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.080\nunderneath our navigation pane.\n\n617\n00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.250\nAnd there is, there's the very\nfirst table that we've created and\n\n618\n00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:58.500\nnow we'll continue to create the rest of\nthose tables and get everything added in.\n\n619\n00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.040\nSo Vonne, that's how we can do that,\nat least at the beginning here.\n\n620\n00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.550\nBut we're actually gonna\nshow you in another episode,\n\n621\n00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.270\nhow you can actually add in\nthe data quicker and it's gonna be\n\n622\n00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:14.370\nneater at that point because it allows you\nto add in existing data insanely fast.\n\n623\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, luckily for you,\nwe've come to the end of this episode, so\n\n624\n00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.750\nyou don't have to continue to talk about\nToto's tutus and have you read off awesome\n\n625\n00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.200\ndescriptions about our products for\nyou to enter into our database.\n\n626\n00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.550\nBut like he said we'll come back and\n\n627\n00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.630\nhave some more episodes on how to make it\na little fast, a little easier for you.\n\n628\n00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.560\nWe're gonna go ahead and end this episode\nnow, signing off for OfficePro.TV,\n\n629\n00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.130\nI've been your host Yvonne Smith.\n\n630\n00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.120\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n631\n00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.254\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n632\n00:30:38.254 -->

Well Vonne, thank you again for\nhaving me back into Office Pro Studios.\n\n9\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.510\nI appreciate it since last time,\nI did talk a bit long.\n\n10\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.620\nSo I only expect to kinda get\nreplaced at some point here.\n\n11\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.130\n&gt;&gt; We decided to keep the door open for\nyou.\n\n12\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.820\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate it.\n\n13\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.610\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're so\ngood at thoroughly explaining everything.\n\n14\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.460\nTo me, I've learned so much.\n\n15\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.820\nIn all of these shows.\n\n16\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.010\nSo I hope you all are too.\n\n17\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.440\nAnd I know that this is a pretty good\nepisode here for everybody because it's\n\n18\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.580\na very common thing I'm sure for\npeople to maybe have data in other places.\n\n19\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n20\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.850\n&gt;&gt; And you don't wanna reinvent the wheel,\nor recreate the wheel.\n\n21\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.790\nSo this is probably an episode,\nthere, it's gonna be near and\n\n22\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.930\nthere in the people's heart because it's\na way that we could probably take it from\n\n23\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.640\none place and\nput it into access is that correct?\n\n24\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We can do that?\n\n25\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Yvonne you're exactly right, the\nvery fact is that we understand something\n\n26\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.150\nnow, is that data rarely just exist\nwhen we create a brand new database.\n\n27\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.630\nIn other words, when we create tables\nis not like we automatically goes\n\n28\n00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.340\nI know data that exist when\nwe start populating it.\n\n29\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610\nMost of the time when we start to\nsay hey I need to use Access for\n\n30\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.140\nsomething, the data already\nexists some place else.\n\n31\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.420\nWell, we can reduplicate the work again.\n\n32\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.800\nIn other words we can create\nthe tables like we did manually.\n\n33\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.640\nAnd if you take a look at that previous\nepisode we showed you how to create\n\n34\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.680\nthose individual fields in Access tables.\n\n35\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.830\nWe manipulated the actual\nfield types a little bit, and\n\n36\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.490\nwe even did a little bit of data entry,\nnow there's one record,\n\n37\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.110\nI chose not to go too far because\nmy typing skills are terrible.\n\n38\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.130\nBut we were able to actually do that.\n\n39\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.260\nWell if you've already done\nthat before such as in Excel or\n\n40\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.060\nsomething else, you don't want to have to\nredo that again when it comes into Access.\n\n41\n00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.300\nAnd the reason why is that\neven though Vonne actually did\n\n42\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.910\nbuild out entire database\nas far as the data goes,\n\n43\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.390\neven though she actually\nentered quite a bit of data in.\n\n44\n00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.330\nIf you've done this and you've actually\nhad it for let's say six months or\n\n45\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.170\nso, you might find that your\nrecord is not 50 or 60,\n\n46\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.640\nbut they may be hundreds if\nnot thousands of records.\n\n47\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.070\nAnd Vonne, I don't know about you.\n\n48\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.750\nMe having to manually retype\nin thousands of records again.\n\n49\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.810\nIt sounds terrible, especially\nwhen the data already exists, and\n\n50\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.650\nwe have the ability, perhaps,\nto actually enter that back into Access.\n\n51\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then I did this two-fold.\n\n52\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; One, because I wasn't really ready and\n\n53\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350\ncomfortable was like\nHere I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.825\njust start Access from scratch and\ncreate our Dancing Dogs Incorporated.\n\n55\n00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:49.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Access database.\n\n56\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But I was comfortable in Excel.\n\n57\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.100\nAnd so I was like, okay, well,\nI know I can go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.360\nput the information to columns and\nworksheets that would have similar types\n\n59\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.450\nof information like customers or\nproducts, knowing that we were gonna go.\n\n60\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.120\nSo it's two-fold,\nI knew we were going to import the data.\n\n61\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.210\nBut it was also for\nthe example, just like this,\n\n62\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.480\nof like saying you probably\nhave the data in Excel.\n\n63\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.880\nAnd you want to take that next\nstep into managing it and access.\n\n64\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.930\nAnd so this is the episode that\nwe need to kinda concentrate on.\n\n65\n00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.720\n&gt;&gt; We definitely do because that's\nwhy people really do come to this.\n\n66\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.610\nBecause we don't have to\nreduplicate that work.\n\n67\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.960\nSo let's take a look at an example about\nwhat Vonne actually created for us.\n\n68\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.830\nThat's gonna help us to speed\nup this database creation\n\n69\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.485\nprocess a little bit more.\n\n70\n00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:39.870\nNow I'm gonna take away\nthe ribbon just for a moment so\n\n71\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.790\nthat we can see the data a little bit.\n\n72\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.980\nIf you take a look at\nthe bottom edge of the screen,\n\n73\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.830\nyou see that Vonne really did go above and\noverboard and I appreciate this.\n\n74\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.430\nThe very fact that she created a table,\nor at least a spreadsheet for\n\n75\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.150\nEmployees, Sales, Products, Inventories,\n\n76\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.400\nStores, Customer Loyalty program,\nand even Customer Pets out here.\n\n77\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.095\nIf not that's somebody's\nweird name there Pinecone.\n\n78\n00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:05.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n79\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.410\nI'm assuming that those\nare the customer pets.\n\n80\n00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.360\nAnd so we have this and\nall of this data that exists.\n\n81\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.400\nIf we take Access and\n\n82\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690\nwe do it the way that we had already\njust done in that previous episode\n\n83\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.220\nmeans we're gonna have to go in and\nmanually, first of all create the table.\n\n84\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.760\nWhich right up here across the very top\n\n85\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.710\nwould include of course\nthose column names.\n\n86\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.810\nOr those field names for us.\n\n87\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.210\nThen we got to go in and\nactually beside the data type.\n\n88\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.400\nAnd whatever other constraints\nthat we want to put on that\n\n89\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.299\nbefore we start manually\nentering in all the data itself.\n\n90\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.840\nAnd that is duplicating the amount\nof work that we have to do\n\n91\n00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.050\nto get those things ready for Access.\n\n92\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.730\nBut the neat thing is,\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n93\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.500\nIf you actually do have the data, and\n\n94\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.100\nit's ready to go, at least what you\nthink is ready to go into a database.\n\n95\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.710\nIt now means that you can\nimport the data directly in.\n\n96\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.570\nNow, I wanna kinda slow down because\neverybody wants to go, all right,\n\n97\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.400\nshow me how to do this.\n\n98\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.080\nLet's get it done okay.\n\n99\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.790\nAnd I understand that but you gotta\nkind of take a pause for a moment.\n\n100\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.550\nAnd the reason why you want to do this now\nbecause if you don't do what we're about\n\n101\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.160\nto talk about here, you don't have to go\nback and kind of redo it again anyways.\n\n102\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.000\nSo let's just take a brief\nmomentary pause and\n\n103\n00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.228\ntalk about what has to happen\nbefore we start to do this okay.\n\n104\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.760\nOne, you do have to kinda prepare\nyour data a little bit and what I\n\n105\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.070\nmean by that is actually for you mentally\nto understand what's gonna happen here.\n\n106\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.587\nAnd then two,\nmake sure that your data exist in\n\n107\n00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:44.530\nthe format that is actually gonna\nbe appropriate in the tables.\n\n108\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.820\nAnd that includes going back and\n\n109\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.840\ntaking a look a little bit about\nthe data normalization for the tables.\n\n110\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.250\nIn other words,\nyou wanna take a look at your data.\n\n111\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.230\nAnd does it follow that idea of some\nof those normalization rules that we've\n\n112\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.630\ntalked about previously?\n\n113\n00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.610\nNow we're not gonna get into that right\nnow because we did kind of a show,\n\n114\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.480\na previous episode, I should say.\n\n115\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.440\nWhen we talk about some\nof the terminology and\n\n116\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.000\nwe did talk about\nthe relationship types there.\n\n117\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.090\nBut we also talk about the normalization\nrules just a little bit as well.\n\n118\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.090\nSo you want to make sure that you're\nfollowing those normalization rules.\n\n119\n00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.010\nIf not, you're gonna have a hard time when\nit comes to importing in some of the data\n\n120\n00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.960\nthat you have.\n\n121\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.090\nAnd then it's gonna wrong,\nthen you have to actually manually,\n\n122\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.000\nI gotta delete this out, or I gotta\nmove this, I've gotta add this in there.\n\n123\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.490\nAnd that's when it starts to\nget a little bit more hefty.\n\n124\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think this is one\nof those like you just mentioned.\n\n125\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.820\nYou do have to be very careful\nabout what your data is right now,\n\n126\n00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.330\nit's current state.\n\n127\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.880\nCuz everyone's like I'll just go ahead and\nimport it.\n\n128\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.560\nBut following those rules of\nproper database design is key,\n\n129\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.000\nis super important.\n\n130\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.160\nSo just because it's in Excel doesn't\nmean that it's in the proper way to\n\n131\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.860\nbring into to Access to make it work\n\n132\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.230\nthe most effective way that\nAccess is supposed to work.\n\n133\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.430\nNow this is kind of those perfect examples\nof where I created this Excel information.\n\n134\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.240\nBut I did this after we\ntalked about all of the,\n\n135\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.980\nhow do we establish relationships,\nwhere do we need the data normalization.\n\n136\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.890\nSo I already had these kind\nof concepts taught to me\n\n137\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.950\nby you first and then I built\nthe Access or Excel information.\n\n138\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.370\nSo just be very aware, and then I knew\nthis was coming when we're talking about,\n\n139\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.330\ndon't just say click the button and\nimport.\n\n140\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.880\nYou got to look at it and make sure.\n\n141\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's gonna be key.\n\n142\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.760\nIf you do this now before you go into it,\nit really is gonna be helpful.\n\n143\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.350\nBut if you've examined your tables and\nyou go all right,\n\n144\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:45.790\nto the best of my ability,\nnow I'm ready to start importing data in.\n\n145\n00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.210\nWell that's when we can begin to do that.\n\n146\n00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.383\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you how to do that as well.\n\n147\n00:07:50.383 --> 00:07:54.559\nI'm simply gonna close out of my Excel\nspreadsheet here or my workbook.\n\n148\n00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:57.493\nAt least I am gonna try to close out\nof it And let me go ahead and save it.\n\n149\n00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.260\nI didn't think I made any changes here.\n\n150\n00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.360\nI've already imported in some data,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n151\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.980\nCuz I wanna make sure, of course,\nthat it worked, first of all.\n\n152\n00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.770\nBut we're gonna import in one of those\ntables that I haven't imported in yet,\n\n153\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.460\nwhich is the employees table, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.370\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\nand I'll zoom in and\n\n155\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.780\nshow you, I've already done some\nimports in to help us save time.\n\n156\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.510\nBecause the process is the same\nwhether I show you one time or\n\n157\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.330\nwhether I show you six times here.\n\n158\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.850\nSo we're gonna do that as well.\n\n159\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.930\nOnce you have Access up and running,\nwhether you have one table in there or\n\n160\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.150\nwhether you have ten tables in there,\nand you need to import in external data.\n\n161\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.620\nAll we have to do is go\nacross the top where we see,\n\n162\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.490\nof course, the ribbon here or the tabs\nthat we have connected to the ribbons.\n\n163\n00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.180\nI click on External Data, and\nnow you have couple of different things.\n\n164\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.060\nAnd this is where it gets a little bit\nconfusing if you're not seeing this for\n\n165\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.120\nthe first time.\n\n166\n00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.260\nIt seems simple enough if I have\nan Excel spreadsheet, Vonne, I go,\n\n167\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.820\nlook, I have an Excel icon on right here,\nI'm ready to go.\n\n168\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.160\nYou click on it and\nyou simply follow directions and\n\n169\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.700\nyou think, this is gonna work.\n\n170\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.250\nBut Vonne, I did not actually focus in and\npay attention to the grouping.\n\n171\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.470\nNow Vonne, the difference here is simple.\n\n172\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.970\nAll of us should understand this.\n\n173\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.250\nBut it's really easy because you go,\n\n174\n00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.300\nI know exactly what Ronnie's gonna do\nsince he has an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n175\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.540\nYou just click on this and\nthen you are ready to go.\n\n176\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.770\nBut what we have to do is we need to go\nover here to the left hand-side a little\n\n177\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.740\nbit,, and now notice that there\nis no direct icon right here for\n\n178\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:36.560\nthe importing of Import and Link for\nExcel, but it says New Data Source.\n\n179\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.210\nIf I click on that drop-down,\nnow I have some different options.\n\n180\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.870\nIt is here that I have where\nI can import from Excel.\n\n181\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.440\nI'm trying to get so that the screen\ntip doesn't do too much here.\n\n182\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.490\nOkay, it's not gonna happen,\nall right, so-\n\n183\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Trying to be too helpful for you.\n\n184\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.842\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n185\n00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.980\nYeah, so this is the best I can do, right?\n\n186\n00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.120\nSo notice that, Vonne,\n\n187\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.640\nI don't only have to limit myself to Excel\n&gt;&gt; But most people, okay,\n\n188\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.630\nthat are probably gonna be\ndoing this into Access,\n\n189\n00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.930\nat least at the beginning, is probably\nbecause they've worked with Excel up\n\n190\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.310\nto that point where they've actually\ngot every bit of data that they have.\n\n191\n00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.100\nAnd the issue, though, right,\nis gonna be that they've probably\n\n192\n00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.720\nsaved everything into one workbook or\none sheet, I should say, in a workbook.\n\n193\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.980\nSo Vonne, this is where we go back\nto what we were just talking about.\n\n194\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.010\nIf all of your data is in one\nworksheet in the workbook, and you go,\n\n195\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:30.090\nI'm gonna import that into Access,\nyou're going to be wasting your\n\n196\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.750\ntime because you're gonna see it's still\ngonna have to break everything apart.\n\n197\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.830\nSo it's better if you know that you're\ngonna be importing data is to follow these\n\n198\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.440\nrules them into the different worksheets.\n\n199\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.240\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat actually almost be easier to do in\n\n200\n00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.400\nExcel-\n&gt;&gt; By far.\n\n201\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.180\n&gt;&gt; Than Access, right?\n\n202\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.372\nBecause with Access, it's kind of like,\nonce you set it, it's set.\n\n203\n00:10:48.372 --> 00:10:53.046\nTrying to move fields from one\ntable to another, it's doable, but\n\n204\n00:10:53.046 --> 00:10:56.165\nit's not really what you should do, right?\n\n205\n00:10:56.165 --> 00:10:59.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's kinda get a for\ninstance of what you're talking about.\n\n206\n00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:03.397\nIf I import everything into one\ntable inside of Access, well,\n\n207\n00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:06.590\nthen I would have to go back and\ncreate a second table.\n\n208\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.200\nThen create those fields of the columns\nthat I want to move in those fields,\n\n209\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.810\nthen add in the data types\nthat I want to in there.\n\n210\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:22.350\nFrom that point, once I get that, it's\nonly then that I can start to import data.\n\n211\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:27.403\nAnd so even before I import any data, if I\nhave everything in one Excel spreadsheet,\n\n212\n00:11:27.403 --> 00:11:29.340\nit's really not going to help.\n\n213\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.804\nSo you want to break those apart.\n\n214\n00:11:30.804 --> 00:11:33.463\n&gt;&gt; You're saying you'd have to\ncreate the field before you, so\n\n215\n00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:35.828\nit's not just like copy,\npaste that makes the field.\n\n216\n00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:36.564\n&gt;&gt; Nope, yeah.\n\n217\n00:11:36.564 --> 00:11:37.233\n&gt;&gt; I get it.\n\n218\n00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:39.460\nSo there's a couple extra steps.\n\n219\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But in Excel, you could just say, okay,\n\n220\n00:11:42.075 --> 00:11:44.143\nI'm gonna select these columns.\n\n221\n00:11:44.143 --> 00:11:46.076\nCopy and paste it into another worksheet.\n\n222\n00:11:46.076 --> 00:11:46.700\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n223\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.474\n&gt;&gt; So it's a lot easier to manipulate\nit in Excel than in Access.\n\n224\n00:11:52.474 --> 00:11:54.459\nGood point.\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're good in Excel,\n\n225\n00:11:54.459 --> 00:11:55.710\nit's a lot easier, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.770\nSo yeah, if you're Vonne Smith in Excel,\nthen yes, it is much easier.\n\n227\n00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.553\nIf you're Ronnie Wong in Excel,\nmaybe not so good so much.\n\n228\n00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Hey, we have Excel shows.\n\n229\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.235\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n230\n00:12:06.235 --> 00:12:08.781\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So don't forget that it does take\n\n231\n00:12:08.781 --> 00:12:12.779\na little bit of time to get it set up for\nthe import of the data.\n\n232\n00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:17.690\nBut once it exists in the proper way\nthat we want it to, this can help.\n\n233\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.562\nWe can even pull from an HTML document or\nof course an XML document, and\n\n234\n00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:23.811\neven a text file.\n\n235\n00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:28.220\nNow you might wonder,\nwhat the heck is this, a text file?\n\n236\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.810\nIt's weird, but Vonne, some of the ways\nthat we also used to be able to\n\n237\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.860\nsave documents to make them portable\nfrom one program to another\n\n238\n00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.200\nis we could even take Excel and go,\nlet's just save it as a text document.\n\n239\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.970\nAnd that's what we could do.\n\n240\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Because that would be\nlike a tab delimited file.\n\n241\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.990\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n242\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.790\n&gt;&gt; Because there's different types.\n\n243\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.500\nDelimiters are separators.\n\n244\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.180\nIf you think of Excel or Access, every\ntime there's a different field or column,\n\n245\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:55.162\nthat would be like a comma or\na tab, CSV comma separated value,\n\n246\n00:12:55.162 --> 00:13:01.710\ntab delimited or tab separated files,\nbut that would be in a text file, a txt.\n\n247\n00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:02.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n248\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.305\n&gt;&gt; So these could be from all different\nplaces, if you have like an enterprise\n\n249\n00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:10.360\nlevel database that only exports in xml,\nit's still gonna be in the same structure.\n\n250\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.666\nWell, hopefully it's\nin the same structure.\n\n251\n00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Lord knows.\n\n252\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.390\nBut what we're seeing here\nis that Access is saying,\n\n253\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.620\nI can pretty much take any of these.\n\n254\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.930\nNot only can it do that,\n\n255\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.090\nnotice that I can also take things\nfrom another Access database or\n\n256\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.880\neven before Access, it was called dBase\nis what it was before Access here.\n\n257\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.350\nSo what does that mean?\n\n258\n00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.140\nIt means if I wanted to\nbuild a new database, and\n\n259\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.470\nthis is where it gets neat, Vonne,\nat least in my perspective.\n\n260\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.160\nLet's say that I knew that I had\ndatabase that existed for one thing and\n\n261\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.340\nI had another database that existed for\nthe other thing, but\n\n262\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.560\nI knew that the perfect database is\nif I could bring them both together.\n\n263\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.730\nWell, I can do that.\n\n264\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.630\nI can go ahead and import in data\nfrom an existing database and\n\n265\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.620\nput it into a new one.\n\n266\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.420\nThen I can also import the other data or\nthe other tables, I should say, and\n\n267\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.070\nimport that into the same database.\n\n268\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.810\nFrom that point, then I could\nstart creating the database that\n\n269\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.180\nI really wanted and\nnot the two separate databases that exist.\n\n270\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.040\n&gt;&gt; And I think this is, this is kind\nof driving home a point for me and\n\n271\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.410\nI just wanna make sure I had this right.\n\n272\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.790\nIt's not a copy-paste.\n\n273\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; You need to import.\n\n274\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n275\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.220\n&gt;&gt; Something, well, Access to Access,\nyou just copy and paste.\n\n276\n00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.790\nIt doesn't really exist in this\ncontext when we are working in Access.\n\n277\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, there's other\nthings in the background, right?\n\n278\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.930\nThe table structure and\nall those data types and everything,\n\n279\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:32.660\nI mean, all that will also have to\nfollow over, too, without changing much.\n\n280\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.590\nAnd sometimes what ends up happening\ntechnically in the background is it says,\n\n281\n00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.870\nyou're importing into a new file.\n\n282\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.100\nI'm gonna choose my defaults instead\nof what you brought it in as.\n\n283\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.780\n&gt;&gt; So there's a lot of different\nthings that can be happening here.\n\n284\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.450\nBut the import is probably the safest and\nthe best way to go in doing this.\n\n285\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.902\n&gt;&gt; And you can pick and choose\nthe tables from one Access database,\n\n286\n00:14:51.902 --> 00:14:57.195\nput it into another Wow, I just learned\nsomething really important, too.\n\n287\n00:14:57.195 --> 00:15:00.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it really is neat because\nyou don't have to take everything in both\n\n288\n00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:01.104\ndatabases.\n\n289\n00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:04.081\nYou can say, if I only had this\ntable here and this table here, but\n\n290\n00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:06.574\nyou knew that the data\nactually correlated together,\n\n291\n00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:09.460\nyou could literally build that and\nit would be perfectly fine.\n\n292\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.480\n&gt;&gt; And this is gonna be the same in Excel,\ntoo, because we're going to pick and\n\n293\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.660\nchoose our worksheets, cuz we're\n\n294\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.520\nnot importing the entire Excel file all\nat once with every single worksheet.\n\n295\n00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.090\nSo we're gonna be able to pick and choose.\n\n296\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.390\nSo we can even have like\nsome worksheets from Excel\n\n297\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.100\nthat make sense in our database.\n\n298\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.140\nMaybe an old database that\nthere was this one good table.\n\n299\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.278\nOf course, the data has to match.\n\n300\n00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:35.610\nBut, I mean, we can pick and\n\n301\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.910\nchoose from multiple places if it all\nmakes sense within the grand scheme.\n\n302\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.240\nWell, that's pretty cool.\n\n303\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.250\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\nIt's kind of neat when you start to see\n\n304\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.410\nhow powerful it can really be.\n\n305\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.070\nMost of us, that when we begin with just\na manual data entry, Vonne, it's just,\n\n306\n00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.150\nyou're just like, no.\n\n307\n00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.380\nI've gotta now recreate everything.\n\n308\n00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.490\nNo, you don't, okay?\n\n309\n00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.915\nThere's other ones that are also out here.\n\n310\n00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:55.412\nThis is a little bit more advanced and\n\n311\n00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:57.448\nwe're probably not gonna\nget into this one here.\n\n312\n00:15:57.448 --> 00:16:00.281\nBut notice SharePoint list and\ndata services.\n\n313\n00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:04.939\nAnd if you have other database sources\nbesides access, you know, ODBC, which is\n\n314\n00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:09.653\na standardized type of formatting-\n&gt;&gt; That's Open Database Connection, right?\n\n315\n00:16:09.653 --> 00:16:10.228\nI remember that one.\n\n316\n00:16:10.228 --> 00:16:11.126\n&gt;&gt; Yep, Open Database Connectivity.\n\n317\n00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Connectivity, okay.\n\n318\n00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.578\n&gt;&gt; You've got it, yeah, that's right.\n\n319\n00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:17.065\nSo it's actually just a generic\nkind of docking that allows you and\n\n320\n00:16:17.065 --> 00:16:19.817\neven Outlook folders can\nbe imported if you want to.\n\n321\n00:16:19.817 --> 00:16:24.704\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was thinking, if you have\nsomething like active directory, right,\n\n322\n00:16:24.704 --> 00:16:27.008\nI'm thinking using big terms here.\n\n323\n00:16:27.008 --> 00:16:30.328\nIt would have like first name,\nlast name, address, and\n\n324\n00:16:30.328 --> 00:16:34.754\nif everything is filled out, those could\nbe fields within your employees or\n\n325\n00:16:34.754 --> 00:16:37.259\ncustomers, or something to that effect.\n\n326\n00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:41.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are called attributes there,\nthey're different type of database, but\n\n327\n00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:42.910\nthe same thing, right, in Outlook.\n\n328\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.785\nIf we have contact information,\nwe can import that right in and\n\n329\n00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:46.988\nbe able to do this as well.\n\n330\n00:16:46.988 --> 00:16:48.960\nAll right, so so much, I keep talking.\n\n331\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.760\nI'm gonna continue talking.\n\n332\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.505\nSo let's-\n&gt;&gt; But these concepts\n\n333\n00:16:50.505 --> 00:16:51.024\nare really important.\n\n334\n00:16:51.024 --> 00:16:53.120\n&gt;&gt; No, they are.\n&gt;&gt; Because if you just said, here,\n\n335\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.920\nclick click go, it's, okay, great,\nbut then if you're doing it wrong.\n\n336\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.547\nI mean, you're like, but I did it right,\nbut you're actually kinda doing it wrong\n\n337\n00:16:59.547 --> 00:17:00.557\ncuz it's-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:17:00.557 --> 00:17:01.630\n&gt;&gt; It has to make sense.\n\n339\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.382\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n340\n00:17:02.382 --> 00:17:03.713\n&gt;&gt; So I'm really appreciating this.\n\n341\n00:17:03.713 --> 00:17:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n342\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.940\n&gt;&gt; This long lecture, cuz [LAUGH].\n\n343\n00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're appreciating that.\n\n344\n00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:11.307\nSomebody at home is groaning,\nthey're going like Ronnie get to it.\n\n345\n00:17:11.307 --> 00:17:13.142\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you have your own shirt.\n\n346\n00:17:13.142 --> 00:17:14.073\nCome on, hello.\n\n347\n00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:16.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm real proud of that, too.\n\n348\n00:17:16.932 --> 00:17:20.645\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI'm gonna click on the Excel, and\n\n349\n00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:24.580\nthen look at that,\nit gives us essentially a wizard.\n\n350\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.360\nNow, I don't know where along\nthe line they kind of don't\n\n351\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.970\nlike calling it a wizard, but technically\nthat's essentially what it is, right.\n\n352\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.900\nIt's a wizard, and now it says follow me,\nI'll help you to get through this process,\n\n353\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.990\nso it's very helpful in what\nwe want to be able to do.\n\n354\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.550\nSo the first idea is simple,\nselect the source, and\n\n355\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.990\nthen the destination of the data.\n\n356\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.272\nSo the first thing I need to do\nis find that Excel workbook.\n\n357\n00:17:47.272 --> 00:17:51.410\nI'm gonna click on the browse button, and\nonce I click on the browse button inside\n\n358\n00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:57.390\nmy Access2016 folder here, I'm going\nto select the one that is the .xlsx.\n\n359\n00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.620\nNow, you do want to be\ncareful when you do this.\n\n360\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.520\nYou might end up with files that have\nthe same name, but notice I turned on\n\n361\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.720\nthe extensions, so I know exactly what\nfile format I am pulling in from.\n\n362\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.860\nThen I'm gonna click Open.\n\n363\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:15.650\nAnd when I do this, I have a decision here\nthat I want to actually be able to do.\n\n364\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.180\nWe're just gonna follow this first one,\n\n365\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.580\nimport source data into a new\ntable in the current database.\n\n366\n00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.040\nIf the specified table doesn't exist,\nnow take a look at this, okay?\n\n367\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.403\nAccess will create it and that's neat,\ncuz I don't have to go on there and Vonne,\n\n368\n00:18:29.403 --> 00:18:33.380\nI don't have to create the field names\nfirst and add in all the data types and\n\n369\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.448\nthen do all that and then import in it.\n\n370\n00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.280\nSo look, if it doesn't exist and\n\n371\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.050\neverything else already does\nin your Excel spreadsheet.\n\n372\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.120\nI can do this for you, but\n\n373\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.350\nnotice Access might overwrite its\ncontents with the imported data.\n\n374\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.950\nChanges made to the source\ndata will not be reflected.\n\n375\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.540\nSo after you import it,\nit doesn't make a link or\n\n376\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.410\na connection to the Excel spreadsheet that\nsays, if I update the Excel spreadsheet\n\n377\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.560\nit's gonna update here in Access, so\nwhat you're doing is doing the import.\n\n378\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.290\nYou're essentially saying,\nwe're cutting this off at this point.\n\n379\n00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.120\nSo you start updating, it's gonna be\nupdating from Access instead, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.677\nNow, we'll deal with kinda\nthe other two here in a little.\n\n381\n00:19:10.677 --> 00:19:12.811\nActually, we'll deal with the second one.\n\n382\n00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:16.330\nThe second one is that\nlinked data concept instead.\n\n383\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.600\nNow, you can do this, but this is probably\nmore of the advanced feature, where\n\n384\n00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.930\ninstead, notice it says it will maintain\na link to the original source data, so\n\n385\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.750\nthat way if you do make\nchanges to the Excel, okay,\n\n386\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:33.130\nit will also update the actual data\nright here in Access II, okay?\n\n387\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.900\nNow, this can cause\na conundrum of sorts as well.\n\n388\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.850\nBecause as far as I know,\nthe link is just one way.\n\n389\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.010\nSo if you update it in Access,\n\n390\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.980\nI don't think it's going to\nupdate your excel spreadsheet.\n\n391\n00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.919\nI could be wrong, but I do not believe\nthat that's what's gonna end up happening.\n\n392\n00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:49.430\n&gt;&gt; What we're saying,\nExcel updates Access, so it's, okay.\n\n393\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.137\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n394\n00:19:51.137 --> 00:19:51.997\n&gt;&gt; Not vice versa.\n\n395\n00:19:51.997 --> 00:19:54.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't believe it's a two way,\nbut I could be wrong on that,\n\n396\n00:19:54.574 --> 00:19:55.340\nI'd have to check.\n\n397\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.750\nI don't know why,\nthat's actually not coming up to my mind.\n\n398\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.004\nWhether or not it's two ways or not,\nbut I believe it's actually one way.\n\n399\n00:20:00.004 --> 00:20:04.388\n&gt;&gt; And these, like you said, it's a little\nbit more of an advanced reason of why you\n\n400\n00:20:04.388 --> 00:20:06.800\nwould want to have this setup that way.\n\n401\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.338\nI mean, I can understand there\nare specific reasons and otherwise,\n\n402\n00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:11.231\nit wouldn't have been a choice,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n403\n00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:14.929\n&gt;&gt; On our import message, but for\nright now, We're concentrating on,\n\n404\n00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:17.687\nthis is going to be\na stand-alone Access database,\n\n405\n00:20:17.687 --> 00:20:21.300\nand no connections to outside sources for\nthis particular level.\n\n406\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just exactly,\nwe're only gonna do this once here, and\n\n407\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.320\nthen we're gonna click OK.\n\n408\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.490\nSo I've selected the option that I want,\nand the source that I want.\n\n409\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.170\nAnd here's the second part of\nthe Import Spreadsheet Wizard.\n\n410\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.590\nAnd notice how it changed\nthe name up here, right?\n\n411\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.010\nImport spreadsheet wizard, so\n\n412\n00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:43.050\nnow we finally get into the wizard\ndef we selected those two instances.\n\n413\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.570\nThis is where you chose the table\nthat you want to import in, okay?\n\n414\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.090\n&gt;&gt; I know that the worksheets\nthat exist in the Excel file.\n\n415\n00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:52.913\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n416\n00:20:52.913 --> 00:20:56.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here is where the worksheets\nare going to be selected and\n\n417\n00:20:56.158 --> 00:20:58.780\nyou only select one at\ntime in this import.\n\n418\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.800\nSo I'm gonna select the employee table.\n\n419\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.019\nYou should see the data\npopulate right here.\n\n420\n00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:06.822\nLet's go ahead and\nclick next here, all right.\n\n421\n00:21:06.822 --> 00:21:10.754\nSo here you notice that once we\nactually have that data show up,\n\n422\n00:21:10.754 --> 00:21:13.359\nnow it automatically check this, okay?\n\n423\n00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:17.930\nAccess can use column headers\nas field names and that's good.\n\n424\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:23.996\nIf your particular Excel table\nhas those field headers in them,\n\n425\n00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:30.073\nnow they don't, it's probably\nnot gonna be checked this one.\n\n426\n00:21:30.073 --> 00:21:34.842\nIt automatically took a look at Access and\nassumed that our first row was gonna be\n\n427\n00:21:34.842 --> 00:21:38.310\nthe actual column matters\n&gt;&gt; And this kind of goes back to making\n\n428\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.350\nsure that your data is organized properly-\n&gt;&gt; Correct\n\n429\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Its like you have to have column\n\n430\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.770\nheadings and which becomes your field\nheadings, if you don't have that this is\n\n431\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.390\nkind of null and void in a sense and\nthis is really just for anything I think.\n\n432\n00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:57.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, its strange Access\nwhen you don't have them.\n\n433\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.790\nIt would generate a kind of,\nI don't want to say random,\n\n434\n00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.410\na serialized field name for you.\n\n435\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:09.545\nSo you'll end up seeing\nsomething that's like EXPR001 or\n\n436\n00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:14.045\n1001 or some number like that\nas just a temporary field name,\n\n437\n00:22:14.045 --> 00:22:16.835\nexpecting that you're gonna go back and\nchange that if you don't have them.\n\n438\n00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:20.289\n&gt;&gt; And it's not gonna be smart enough\nto say, those look like states,\n\n439\n00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:21.887\nor, those look like names.\n\n440\n00:22:21.887 --> 00:22:23.347\nSo it can't be that smart for us.\n\n441\n00:22:23.347 --> 00:22:30.845\n&gt;&gt; No, and so if you go, man, I have\nthis Excel spreadsheet that works great.\n\n442\n00:22:30.845 --> 00:22:32.420\nI don't have any field names.\n\n443\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:37.000\nIt's better if you go ahead and\ninsert in a row in Excel and\n\n444\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.680\ncreate those field names\nthat you want to see.\n\n445\n00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.320\nNow, I do want to go ahead and\nsay this and make sure that we understand.\n\n446\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.680\nIf you have to do that\nwith your Excel data,\n\n447\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.370\nmake sure you name the field names\nwithout spaces in them of use\n\n448\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.000\nunderscore instead of spaces to\nshow you that gap that you want to.\n\n449\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.700\nAnd the reason why is that you\nare gonna prepare yourself for\n\n450\n00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.180\nwhat is coming up in terms of queries\nas we continue to move forward\n\n451\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.470\ninside of our Access Essentials show,\nokay.\n\n452\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.978\nWhen you add in Spaces it begins to get\na little bit wiggy when you start to do\n\n453\n00:23:08.978 --> 00:23:09.869\nthe queries.\n\n454\n00:23:09.869 --> 00:23:12.190\nSo make sure you kind\nof keep up convention.\n\n455\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.083\n&gt;&gt; So that's a good thing for\nthe prepping of our information,\n\n456\n00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:19.058\nget rid of any spaces in\nyour column headings or\n\n457\n00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:23.584\nwhat will be your field headings\nbecause that's gonna be important.\n\n458\n00:23:23.584 --> 00:23:24.097\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n459\n00:23:24.097 --> 00:23:25.820\n&gt;&gt; So more prep tips for you.\n\n460\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.790\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n461\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.280\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the next portion here,\n\n462\n00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.325\nwhat we're doing which\nis simply clicking Next.\n\n463\n00:23:32.325 --> 00:23:34.960\nSo the great thing is it\ngives you this preview and\n\n464\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.330\nthat's what you want to examine right now,\nright, is you wanna take a look.\n\n465\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.560\nDoes this have all the data in\nit that you're expecting to see?\n\n466\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.630\nYou're the only one that can know that,\nokay.\n\n467\n00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.158\nI don't know because I\ndon't know your data.\n\n468\n00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:49.491\nBut are these the columns you're expecting\nto see in the table that you want to\n\n469\n00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.769\nimport into Access, and\nif it is, you simply click Next.\n\n470\n00:23:52.769 --> 00:23:56.912\nAnd now, it gives you a course\nto some other options, okay?\n\n471\n00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:59.195\nYou're gonna choose\nessentially what field.\n\n472\n00:23:59.195 --> 00:24:03.000\nNotice that I can click on First,\nand it changes up there to first.\n\n473\n00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.810\nI can click on address, and\nnotice it changes up here at the top.\n\n474\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:12.770\nWell, normally on most tables, at least\nat this level, if we're gonna do an index\n\n475\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.160\non anything, it's probably gonna be on the\nfield that we consider the primary key.\n\n476\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.450\nSo, I'm gonna say this employee ID for\nthe employee is gonna be my employee ID.\n\n477\n00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.820\nAnd I can go ahead and\nmake sure that it's indexed.\n\n478\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.030\nNow you don't have to, but if I know\nthat this gonna be my primary key,\n\n479\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.350\nI want that field index to make for\na faster search.\n\n480\n00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.460\nThen I'm gonna say,\nyes I want an index but no duplicates.\n\n481\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.850\nNow this is the one that\nwill kind of trip you up.\n\n482\n00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:44.300\nIf there are duplicates in this field,\nit's gonna bounce you a couple of times.\n\n483\n00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.508\nAnd tell you, hey, you can't do this,\nyou've got duplicates here.\n\n484\n00:24:47.508 --> 00:24:52.840\nSo you'll simply just say, hey,\neither no or yes to okay on duplicates.\n\n485\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.850\nBut typically, on your primary key field,\n\n486\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.330\nwhichever one that you decide,\nyou probably go ahead and do this.\n\n487\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.560\nYes and then No Duplicates and\nthat will ensure that it's unique.\n\n488\n00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.510\n&gt;&gt; This might be a silly question, but\n\n489\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.400\ndoes it always have to be the first\ncolumn in your table as your primary key?\n\n490\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.580\nDoes it always need to be that first one?\n\n491\n00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.950\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't have to be.\n\n492\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.665\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The first one,\n\n493\n00:25:14.665 --> 00:25:18.091\nmost of us just go head and do that\nbecause it's easier to just go, all right,\n\n494\n00:25:18.091 --> 00:25:19.810\nthe very first field is gonna be that.\n\n495\n00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.940\nBut you can put it at the end or\nwherever you want to.\n\n496\n00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.100\nAs long as you remember\nwhich one's the primary key.\n\n497\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.971\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nit could be the fourth column or whatever.\n\n498\n00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:26.845\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n499\n00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:31.734\n&gt;&gt; But more of that prepping if you wanna\nkind of keep in the convention if you\n\n500\n00:25:31.734 --> 00:25:32.544\nwanna say.\n\n501\n00:25:32.544 --> 00:25:34.205\nIt may be moving that, or propping,\n\n502\n00:25:34.205 --> 00:25:38.120\nor cutting that column over into being the\ncolumn A and then moving everything over.\n\n503\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.435\n&gt;&gt; Correct, all right.\n\n504\n00:25:41.435 --> 00:25:42.183\n&gt;&gt; Thought I'd ask.\n\n505\n00:25:42.183 --> 00:25:44.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no yeah you don't\nalways have to do it that way.\n\n506\n00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.690\nWe just kind of by default,\n\n507\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.710\nif I put that in the front and\nwe think it's the most important column.\n\n508\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.697\nAnd normally it is.\n\n509\n00:25:50.697 --> 00:25:53.410\n&gt;&gt; And that's where the indexing\nis there will be no duplicates,\n\n510\n00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.410\nbecause it's the unique primary key.\n\n511\n00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.902\n&gt;&gt; Very good Vonsie.\n\n512\n00:25:56.902 --> 00:25:58.456\n&gt;&gt; Morning.\n\n513\n00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:03.226\n&gt;&gt; The other thing, of course, is you can\nnow go ahead and also decide if you say,\n\n514\n00:26:03.226 --> 00:26:05.270\nhey, look, right here, okay.\n\n515\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.130\nNotice that the data type hasn't changed.\n\n516\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.180\nBut if you wanted to,\nyou could change the data type.\n\n517\n00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.881\nSo if you realized that there was a field\nthat you wanna calculate in someplace,\n\n518\n00:26:14.881 --> 00:26:16.384\nwell, you just simply change.\n\n519\n00:26:16.384 --> 00:26:18.737\nNow, this one on zip has double, I think.\n\n520\n00:26:18.737 --> 00:26:21.480\nThey might've said, look, we're never\ngonna use that for anything else.\n\n521\n00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.980\nI could change this to\nshort text if I want to.\n\n522\n00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.850\nAnd it's not gonna matter, cuz access\nis just putting in tales and doing it.\n\n523\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.800\nSo you can remanipulate those fields\nthe way that you want to right here.\n\n524\n00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.280\nAnd then it imports in that way.\n\n525\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.820\n&gt;&gt; And,\nthat one tripped me up a little bit too,\n\n526\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.330\nbecause I'm like, but they're numbers.\n\n527\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.490\nBut, we're not calculating\nwith those numbers.\n\n528\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.448\nIt's a zip code so\nwe're gonna treat it as text.\n\n529\n00:26:43.448 --> 00:26:45.414\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, that's, just clarifying for\n\n530\n00:26:45.414 --> 00:26:48.180\nyou'll out there if you're like,\nbut those are numbers.\n\n531\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.376\nYeah, but it's still text.\n\n532\n00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:51.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really just used for\nidentification.\n\n533\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.550\nIf we were gonna use this in some\ntype of calculation later on,\n\n534\n00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.760\nsome type of formula,\nthen it would be different.\n\n535\n00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.447\nBut most of us are probably not gonna\ncalculate by our zoned, postal code here.\n\n536\n00:27:01.447 --> 00:27:02.640\n&gt;&gt; Or phone number or\na few things like that.\n\n537\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Or phone number, yeah.\n\n538\n00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.942\n&gt;&gt; So going through each one.\n\n539\n00:27:04.942 --> 00:27:09.022\nAnd I think this is another key of you\ndon't wanna necessarily just go Next,\n\n540\n00:27:09.022 --> 00:27:10.189\nNext, Next, stop.\n\n541\n00:27:10.189 --> 00:27:14.230\nYou do wanna go through each\none of these Wizard screens.\n\n542\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:18.297\nAnd go through each one of these columns,\nor fields now,\n\n543\n00:27:18.297 --> 00:27:22.740\nin our import to make sure that\nit is done the proper way.\n\n544\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah you can do this later, but\n\n545\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.090\nremember you're just duplicating your work\ninstead of doing it all at one time here.\n\n546\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.020\nSo here I'm gonna click Next, and\n\n547\n00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.110\nnow notice that,\nlook Access is trying to be helpful, okay?\n\n548\n00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.870\nIt says, look, if you don't know which\none of these is your primary key,\n\n549\n00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.900\ncuz you might not know, okay?\n\n550\n00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.030\nIt says, do you want to let Access decide.\n\n551\n00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.814\nAnd, if you let Access decide, it's gonna\ngenerate that auto key field for us.\n\n552\n00:27:46.814 --> 00:27:48.781\n&gt;&gt; Is that the one that's over\non the left-hand side a little,\n\n553\n00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:49.398\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n554\n00:27:49.398 --> 00:27:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n555\n00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.934\n&gt;&gt; So notice-\n&gt;&gt; We didn't make that!\n\n556\n00:27:50.934 --> 00:27:52.720\n&gt;&gt; No, we didn't make that.\n\n557\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.070\nSo Access is saying, look, Ronnie,\n\n558\n00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.120\nI don't know if you actually know\nwhat a primary key is, Ronnie.\n\n559\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.694\nBecause you may actually not understand\na single thing about databases.\n\n560\n00:28:00.694 --> 00:28:02.770\nAnd somebody just told you,\nimport these tables in there.\n\n561\n00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.710\nDo you wanna let Access do it, or\ndo you want to choose your own, okay?\n\n562\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.030\nIf you don't know for\nsure, let Access do it.\n\n563\n00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.203\nAnd I mean that.\n\n564\n00:28:10.203 --> 00:28:11.527\nBecause it will just generate that field.\n\n565\n00:28:11.527 --> 00:28:15.033\nAnd it doesn't,\nit doesn't hurt your data any bit.\n\n566\n00:28:15.033 --> 00:28:18.514\nBut if you've already decided on yours,\nwhich I have,\n\n567\n00:28:18.514 --> 00:28:23.010\nwhich is the EmployeeID,\nI can simply choose my own primary key.\n\n568\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.210\nFrom this point,\nnotice it's all EmployeeID,\n\n569\n00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.970\nwhich is the one that I already chose,\nand I'm gonna use that.\n\n570\n00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.100\nSo remember that the primary\nkey has to be unique.\n\n571\n00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.230\n&gt;&gt; So every one of these values has to be\nunique here, then I'm gonna click Next.\n\n572\n00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.720\nAnd now it's gonna ask what\ndo I want to import this as?\n\n573\n00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.470\nI'm gonna do Employees table for\nright now.\n\n574\n00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.590\nThere's a weird check box down here.\n\n575\n00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:50.300\nI would like the wizard to analyze\nmy table after importing the data.\n\n576\n00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.970\nI, as a beginner, I would not do this.\n\n577\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.610\nAnd I hate to say this,\nthis will frighten you if you do this.\n\n578\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.861\n&gt;&gt; I did it and I was just like,\nI don't understand.\n\n579\n00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:05.417\nSo I can concur,\ndon't check the box, okay?\n\n580\n00:29:05.417 --> 00:29:06.760\nJust don't do it.\n\n581\n00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do it yet.\n\n582\n00:29:07.985 --> 00:29:12.022\nOkay, as you get more understanding,\nyou create your second and third database,\n\n583\n00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:13.010\ntake a look and see.\n\n584\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.230\nBecause, by that point,\nyou'll understand what it's trying to do.\n\n585\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.210\nBut if you try and do it now, you're gonna\nget confused by the questions it asks you,\n\n586\n00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.900\nand then what it shows you.\n\n587\n00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.820\nIt's just not gonna be worth it.\n\n588\n00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.821\n&gt;&gt; It makes you feel like\nyou're just running in circles.\n\n589\n00:29:24.821 --> 00:29:26.640\nYou're like, but wait, did I do that?\n\n590\n00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.310\nDid I do it wrong?\n\n591\n00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.040\nIt's a little off-putting.\n\n592\n00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Yep, all right, so\nlet's go ahead and click Finish.\n\n593\n00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.330\nAnd then it's gonna ask if\nI wanna save this again.\n\n594\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.658\nCuz there's a possibility\nI'm gonna run it.\n\n595\n00:29:36.658 --> 00:29:38.528\nI'm not gonna worry about it for\nright now.\n\n596\n00:29:38.528 --> 00:29:40.690\nSo let me show you that.\n\n597\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.990\nYou want to save these import steps\nthat allow you to repeat the operation.\n\n598\n00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.160\nI'm just gonna say no for\nright now and not check that.\n\n599\n00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.778\nClick Close, and\nthat's it, you've done it.\n\n600\n00:29:49.778 --> 00:29:52.160\nYou're probably saying, are you sure?\n\n601\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.356\nIf I double click over here on\nthe left-hand side on employees,\n\n602\n00:29:55.356 --> 00:29:56.194\nthere they are.\n\n603\n00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:57.450\n&gt;&gt; There it is!\n\n604\n00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.630\n&gt;&gt; So there's all of the data imported in,\ntable created.\n\n605\n00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:07.570\nAnd now we have those tables imported in,\nand we've got a little bit more to go.\n\n606\n00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.580\nNow, Vonne, we're gonna end this episode,\n\n607\n00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.030\ncuz I'm kind of running\na little bit low on time here.\n\n608\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.930\nBut we do have the ability, like you said,\n\n609\n00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.730\nto actually import in\nfrom another data type.\n\n610\n00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.900\nAnd even, we wanna do one more thing,\n\n611\n00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.290\nwhich is to show you how you\ncan append data into a table.\n\n612\n00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.520\nSo a table that already exists, and\nyou still need to add data into it.\n\n613\n00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.340\nWe still wanna show you,\nalso, how to do that as well.\n\n614\n00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.460\nBut we'll need to do that\nin another episode, Vonne.\n\n615\n00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.075\nSo I'm gonna let you take over now.\n\n616\n00:30:34.075 --> 00:30:36.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nthat sounds like a lot of fun.\n\n617\n00:30:36.052 --> 00:30:38.848\nIt looks like all of our people came over,\nI saw Tebow came over.\n\n618\n00:30:38.848 --> 00:30:39.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see.\n\n619\n00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.001\n&gt;&gt; And and.\n\n620\n00:30:42.001 --> 00:30:44.310\nYes, so we got everybody in there.\n\n621\n00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.113\nBut, like you said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n622\n00:30:46.113 --> 00:30:48.346\ncontinue on with some other\nways in some other episodes.\n\n623\n00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:51.737\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ncircle this, circle this up?\n\n624\n00:30:51.737 --> 00:30:53.131\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead and\n\n625\n00:30:53.131 --> 00:30:54.550\nclose this out right now.\n\n626\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.855\nSo, signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n627\n00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:58.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n628\n00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:59.610\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n629\n00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:04.748\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hello, how are you doing, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.850\n&gt;&gt; I am good, thank you once again for\nhaving me back into Office Pro here as we\n\n10\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.800\ncontinue on with Access and\nespecially importing data into tables.\n\n11\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.100\nNow we had actually planned for\nthis to really be one episode.\n\n12\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.302\nBut knowing me, I talk a lot, and so\n\n13\n00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:49.055\nit's gonna be a Part 2 is what\nwe're going to take a look at.\n\n14\n00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:50.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, I talked a lot too.\n\n15\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.250\nI had a lot of questions and a lot of,\nhey is this how we need to do things.\n\n16\n00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.020\nAnd just kinda putting in a few\ntwo cents here and there but\n\n17\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.225\nwe have talked about\nbringing in from Excel.\n\n18\n00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:03.603\nIn this episode we're gonna\ntalk about the CSV file and\n\n19\n00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:09.150\nthen you also mentioned about appending,\nso that's our two main subjects, right?\n\n20\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what we're gonna take\na look at of course is that, remember,\n\n21\n00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:15.910\ndon't limit yourself and don't think that\nif you already have data that exist in\n\n22\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.670\nother file format\n&gt;&gt; That it has to be brought\n\n23\n00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.910\ninto Excel first before you can do this.\n\n24\n00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.650\nIt can exist in some other way instead,\nand\n\n25\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.310\nthen we can import the data right in,\nokay?\n\n26\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.950\nSo let me show you an example of a file\nthat the data exist outside of an excel\n\n27\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.900\nspreadsheet, now Vonne,\nhere is the data, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.410\nIt doesn't look like much as\nI start to take a look at and\n\n29\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.410\nI really can't believe that this\nrepresents much of anything.\n\n30\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.920\nBut Vonne, this is part of that CSV\nfile that we've been talking about.\n\n31\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.410\nAnd that .csv stands for\ncomma separated values.\n\n32\n00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.230\nAnd what they're saying, or\nat least in database terms for\n\n33\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.770\nwhat we need to understand.\n\n34\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.940\nIs that the way that this file is set up\nis for import or even export out, right,\n\n35\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.060\nis that in between each of my columns,\nyou're going to essentially see a comma.\n\n36\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.440\nOkay, so it doesn't matter\nwhat the spacing is, okay.\n\n37\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.580\nWhat matters is this and\nthat particular marker then, for\n\n38\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.700\nus, is a comma, and\nthat is what separates our values.\n\n39\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.340\nHence, comma-separated\nvalues is what we see.\n\n40\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.910\nSo even though it doesn't look like it\nlines up, and it's not in particular\n\n41\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.390\ncolumns, according to databases,\nthough, it really is, and it helps us.\n\n42\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.090\nAnd we've talked about a few\nother formats that may do this.\n\n43\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.271\nSo a comma is not the only\nvalue that we have.\n\n44\n00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:43.709\nWe can see tabs, you can do spaces, you\ncan actually even do letters if you want\n\n45\n00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.290\nto, but that'd be silly, for you to\ndo that, but I mean, it can be done.\n\n46\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.540\n&gt;&gt; It's a delimiter.\n\n47\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.884\n&gt;&gt; It's a delimiter.\n&gt;&gt; It's like what the tech,\n\n48\n00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:56.989\nthe techy name in there, that's\nthe thing that separates the values.\n\n49\n00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.026\nThat's the thing that separates the thing,\nwow, that's so descriptive!\n\n50\n00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:01.837\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n51\n00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:05.136\nthis is the information that we\nwant to be able to pull into and\n\n52\n00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:07.040\naccess the database, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.690\nSo here it is, and it's stored this way.\n\n54\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.470\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nwhen in the world do we ever save this?\n\n55\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.100\nWell, you can do this with anything,\njust about, right?\n\n56\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.505\nSo, it might be where you have some other\naccess database, or something else and\n\n57\n00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:21.890\nyou go, I just wanna back up, and\nyeah she has something like this too.\n\n58\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.922\n&gt;&gt; And\nI remember when I was first starting out.\n\n59\n00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:28.415\nI did this, I'm like,\nI don't ever want to use this format, but\n\n60\n00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:31.438\nlike the more you use it,\nit's so common and\n\n61\n00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:36.300\nuniversal across platforms that it's\nan option in a lot of programs.\n\n62\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Just about everything.\n\n63\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.568\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\nwhen you start working with it,\n\n64\n00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:43.373\nyou just have to think about every time\nyou see a comma, that's a column in Excel.\n\n65\n00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:46.550\nAnd that's the easiest way to put it.\n\n66\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.010\n&gt;&gt; So, that actually goes to our warning\nthough, Vonne, that we have to tell them.\n\n67\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.980\nIf somebody says, just take all those\nCSVs and import them into Access.\n\n68\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.514\nThe key for you, if you don't know what\nthey mean is, don't go in here and\n\n69\n00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:00.835\nerase anything, okay.\n\n70\n00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:01.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n71\n00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.512\n&gt;&gt; Just leave it alone.\n\n72\n00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:07.450\nSo if you open this up and go, I don't\nknow what it is, that's perfectly fine.\n\n73\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.740\nJust simply close out like I'm doing.\n\n74\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.640\nAnd then ask you to save any changes,\ndon't save the changes.\n\n75\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.245\nThe data exists in the format\nthat it needs to and\n\n76\n00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:20.434\nthat's what we want to actually leave\nit as, as we go ahead and import this.\n\n77\n00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:21.823\nSo I've closed out that.\n\n78\n00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:26.270\nHere's the last table that we imported in\nfrom Excel, which is the employees table.\n\n79\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.604\nAnd we see all the data\nthat it brought in.\n\n80\n00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:32.924\nThe next table that I want to import in\nis actually gonna be the one that we saw\n\n81\n00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:35.718\nthere which was labeled sales, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:41.160\nSo we're gonna do the same thing at this\npoint where we select our external data\n\n83\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.500\nand then over on the left hand corner\nwhere it says, New Data Source.\n\n84\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.460\nI'm gonna click there, then underneath\non the drop down menu select File and\n\n85\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.900\nthis time I'm gonna select the Text File.\n\n86\n00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.060\nBecause that's what we saw even though\nwe call it a comma delimited or\n\n87\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.779\na comma separated value, and then .csv.\n\n88\n00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.810\nI use notepad to open it up.\n\n89\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.320\nIt's a simple text file,\nis what we have available to us.\n\n90\n00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because CSV is not an actual\noption so that could be a little\n\n91\n00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:12.120\nconfusing, like wait- so I choose\ntext file for this one, all right.\n\n92\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is,\n\n93\n00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:16.210\nit could be that way especially if\nsomebody manually saved it that way.\n\n94\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.580\nBut if I click browse now,\nI might be wondering,\n\n95\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.080\nhow do I know this is gonna be correct?\n\n96\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.390\nWell notice because I chose text file,\nI'm gonna zoom in,\n\n97\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.580\nlet me see if I can move that over\njust a little bit, there we go, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.870\nSo notice it says, hey, all of text files.\n\n99\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.207\nAnd you can see all the extensions here.\n\n100\n00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:37.212\nDot txt, dot csv, even a dot tab and a dot\nASCII, is the other one that you also\n\n101\n00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:42.300\nsee available to you right here\nbecause they're all simple text files.\n\n102\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.285\nThat you can actually end up using for\n\n103\n00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:47.840\nthis type of formatting that\nyou have available, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.050\nSo, here it is.\n\n105\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.850\nNow, you'll notice something strange here,\n\n106\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.660\nespecially if you have the entire\nOffice suite installed.\n\n107\n00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.060\nAs With Excel.\n\n108\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.645\nNotice that even though I showed you\nthat I opened it up with Notepad.\n\n109\n00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:02.020\nVonne, take a look at this icon over here.\n\n110\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.510\nThat's a little bit strange.\n\n111\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.520\nIt looks like it's supposed to open up in\nExcel and according to the type over here.\n\n112\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.460\nLet me see if I can zoom out so\nthat we can expand this out.\n\n113\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.130\nAnd double click.\n\n114\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.860\nNotice what it says that it actually is.\n\n115\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.030\n&gt;&gt; This is a common thing that happens\nwith CSV files with Office is that\n\n116\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.760\nit's a mime text that file extensions or\n\n117\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.460\nfile types automatically associate\nthemselves with a particular product.\n\n118\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.054\nAnd especially if it's something\nthat was say from Excel to a CSV,\n\n119\n00:06:36.054 --> 00:06:41.017\nit's always going to choose\nthat particular program as,\n\n120\n00:06:41.017 --> 00:06:43.468\nthis is my family, in a sense.\n\n121\n00:06:43.468 --> 00:06:46.060\nThis is what I associate myself with.\n\n122\n00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.444\nThis is actually one of those weird,\ntotally side note- but like PDFs,\n\n123\n00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:53.960\nand it's always associating itself\nwith opening up with reader, but\n\n124\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.330\nyou really want it to open\nup in Acrobat Professional.\n\n125\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.116\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then you have to change the default\n\n126\n00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:00.638\nfive times.\n\n127\n00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:01.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's something that you\n\n128\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.540\nmight have some experience with but\nthat's the reason why.\n\n129\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n130\n00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.540\n&gt;&gt; CSV is showing as an Excel file but\nit's not an Excel file, technically.\n\n131\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.430\n&gt;&gt; And but\nit's a good thing to point out, right?\n\n132\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.070\nBecause you could get confused if you go,\n\n133\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.760\nwell I know it's a .csv, but\nit says that Excel's gonna open it up.\n\n134\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.320\nAnd if you double-click on it,\nit will open up in Excel automatically,\n\n135\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.690\nbecause it does associate itself that way.\n\n136\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.549\nBut overall, though, it really is in\nthe background of just a simple text\n\n137\n00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.297\nfile that got this extension and\nis associated as a text file normally.\n\n138\n00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:36.667\n&gt;&gt; And since we've chosen that\nwe're importing a text file and\n\n139\n00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:40.955\nthe one at the bottom, it's not gonna\nshow you where the Excel files are.\n\n140\n00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:45.365\nSo if you had chose import, data,\nexcel and you're looking for the CSV file.\n\n141\n00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably not gonna show up.\n\n142\n00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:52.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are separate file types,\nwe have to make sure that we're importing\n\n143\n00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.225\nin the right thing and\nthen choosing the right thing.\n\n144\n00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.154\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n145\n00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:58.469\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Vonne,\nyou bring up a good point.\n\n146\n00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:00.729\nI didn't emphasize this but\nlet me go ahead and do so now.\n\n147\n00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:04.941\nSo right here where my cursor actually\nis It is a drop down menu, and\n\n148\n00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:06.684\nthis is where you can pick.\n\n149\n00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:08.650\nActually this one,\nyou can only pick that one.\n\n150\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Because it is text files.\n\n151\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.380\n&gt;&gt; Because it's a text file.\n\n152\n00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.490\nBut if I would of chosen just\na regular file of any type,\n\n153\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.100\nyou probably would see all of them.\n\n154\n00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.440\nBut this actually helps\nyou out when you do that.\n\n155\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.330\nYou may see where there's\nmultiple options for you.\n\n156\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.370\nIf there is, pick the right one\nthat you think it's gonna be, okay.\n\n157\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.920\nAt that point, we just simply click\nopen and now we go back through,\n\n158\n00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.550\nkind of the same thing that we\ndid a little bit earlier but\n\n159\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.229\nthis is again is where you have\nto pay attention once again okay.\n\n160\n00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:38.255\nWe are gonna import in the source\ndata into a new table,\n\n161\n00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:40.465\nbecause that's what it is\nactually designed to be.\n\n162\n00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:46.350\nAnd when I do so, you will notice\nthat the formatting does not look as\n\n163\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.285\nnice as what we saw when we\nimported it in from Excel.\n\n164\n00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:53.604\nNotice we had those nice kind of\ncolumns really separated out and\n\n165\n00:08:53.604 --> 00:08:58.270\nthis time you are looking and going really\nis that the way is gonna end up looking?\n\n166\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.840\nIs what you end up seeing here,\nbut that's what you have.\n\n167\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.350\nNow, notice that it also gives you\nthis other option which is what it's\n\n168\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.750\nexpecting as well.\n\n169\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.710\nThere is a fixed width and that normally\nsomething like, if you do two spaces in\n\n170\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.970\nbetween everything or if you want the idea\nof a tab, it will do that same as well.\n\n171\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.100\nEven though this one says tab separated.\n\n172\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.264\nSo you can actually do a fixed width here\nyou go, I'm gonna put five spaces in\n\n173\n00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:23.901\nbetween, four spaces in between\nevery single value [CROSSTALK]\n\n174\n00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Because as you see white space.\n\n175\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.620\nThe number of white space as opposed\nto like the hidden characters.\n\n176\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.830\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like that's an actual\n\n177\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.560\ninput character as a comma\n&gt;&gt; Or a tab.\n\n178\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n179\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.740\nSo that's what we're seeing right here so\nfar, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.870\nSo at this point, we're gonna kind of\nleave this advanced part alone for\n\n181\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.000\nright now, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.960\nBecause if not, that will take me off\ninto a rabbit trail that I really\n\n183\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.650\ndon't want to get into because\nwe're simply importing.\n\n184\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.392\nWe'll probably get into it then,\nof course,\n\n185\n00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:53.060\nas we head in to just like\nadvanced access a little bit more.\n\n186\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.280\nBut for now,\nlet's just kind of ignore that because\n\n187\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.360\nwe just want to get the data\ninto access at this point.\n\n188\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.330\nI'm gonna click Next here.\n\n189\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.240\nAnd now notice this going to\nbegin to separate this out.\n\n190\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.170\nAnd you can see what are common.\n\n191\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.190\nSo here's a Tab possibility as\ndeliver if you can't identify it.\n\n192\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.900\nSemicolon, Spaces or\neven Other, if you wanted to.\n\n193\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.130\n&gt;&gt; But it usually finds like it sees\nthe commas, it will see the tabs.\n\n194\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.330\nThat should almost be an automatic\nchoice through the wizard,\n\n195\n00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.610\nand now, since it is seeing the limiter or\nthe separator,\n\n196\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.110\nit is showing us in the next\ncolumns within the wizard.\n\n197\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n198\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.465\nHopefully your data is\nseparated out the way.\n\n199\n00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:38.440\nOkay, where every single row is\nactually delimited the same way.\n\n200\n00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.870\nEvery once in a while you will\nrun across for one reason or\n\n201\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.460\nanother, that somebody's actually appended\nthese files together by copying and\n\n202\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.850\npasting from one particular\nfile into another file.\n\n203\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.970\nAnd when something like that happens, you\nmay end up getting some weirder things,\n\n204\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.990\nbut that shouldn't happen, but\nit does happen every once and a while.\n\n205\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.200\nSo first row contains Field names,\nand this is good as well.\n\n206\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.670\nEven if you have a comma separated\nvalue file is just a text file,\n\n207\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:08.430\nI would go ahead and add-in those\nheader names that I would want to see.\n\n208\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.970\nIn that, put a comma in between and\n\n209\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:16.150\nlet that actually play out the way\nthat needs to there as well, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.890\nAll right, let's go in and\nclick Next here.\n\n211\n00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.870\nAnd now you can see, oops, what did I?\n\n212\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.460\nI was trying, I unchecked it, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.190\nSo Vonne, this is actually good.\n\n214\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.810\nCuz I'm like, why did that appear?\n\n215\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.580\nBecause I forgot to put a checkbox.\n\n216\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.160\nAnd here's what you see right here, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.780\nSo this one just says instead of, I think\nI was talking about something different\n\n218\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.810\nin the previous episode where I said\nthat it would generate a header for you.\n\n219\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.357\nAnd says it's like expr 001.\n\n220\n00:11:43.357 --> 00:11:47.477\nActually it shows you what it generates\ninstead, which is just Field1, Field2,\n\n221\n00:11:47.477 --> 00:11:48.706\nField3, and Field4.\n\n222\n00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:53.079\n&gt;&gt; And that could be a problem, because\nyou can see right there in the Field5,\n\n223\n00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:55.620\nStore number, but then you have numbers.\n\n224\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's gonna kinda mess up your data\n\n225\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:02.850\nbecause then it's not all the same\ntype within that field, so yeah.\n\n226\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.149\nBut this is also, we've got a back button,\ndon't we, Ronnie?\n\n227\n00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's what we want.\n\n228\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.100\nWe want that back button,\nand then make sure.\n\n229\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.980\nSometimes you just\nforget like I did there.\n\n230\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.700\nI don't know why I thought I\nchecked it and then I moved on and\n\n231\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.410\nit showed me wrong.\n\n232\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.670\n&gt;&gt; You have to check every,\nnot just next, next, next, continue.\n\n233\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.300\nCheck every single window when\nyou're going to the wizard.\n\n234\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.468\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because I'll do the same thing,\n\n235\n00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:25.782\nyou get going too fast,\nyou're not paying attention.\n\n236\n00:12:25.782 --> 00:12:26.318\nWe all do it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n237\n00:12:26.318 --> 00:12:28.221\n&gt;&gt; So it's okay.\n[LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:12:28.221 --> 00:12:28.794\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n239\n00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:32.950\nso here's the other one that we also\nwanna pay attention too as well, okay.\n\n240\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.810\nSo, remember that we can now go back\nthrough and start to add-in our\n\n241\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.710\ndata types right here on the top under\nfield of options that were seeing.\n\n242\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.280\nAnd I simply click on\neach one of this fields\n\n243\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.280\nto make sure that it's doing what\nI want it to be able to do, okay?\n\n244\n00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.890\nSo, notice that this one\nunder Quantity this time.\n\n245\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.660\nThis is something I can calculate with,\nright?\n\n246\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.882\nI can calculate this with a unit price\nif I wanted to for my products table.\n\n247\n00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:00.700\nAnd I do that,\nI'm gonna leave it as an integer or\n\n248\n00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:06.420\neven change this to maybe Currency but\nquantity is probably not gonna be\n\n249\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.640\na currency, but an integer is\npretty good or a long integer.\n\n250\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.980\nThis one left it as long integer,\nI am gonna leave the default because\n\n251\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.710\nI don't know how long the possibilities\nare of how many items you can buy from me.\n\n252\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.170\nBut I'm not gonna limit it at this point.\n\n253\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.980\n&gt;&gt; It won't hurt to choose it as long,\neven if we're only gonna have 1 to 20.\n\n254\n00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Correct,\nyeah it's not gonna hurt anything at all.\n\n255\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.970\nSo I'm gonna select SalesID,\n\n256\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.320\nbecause this is going to be my\nparticular primary key for this table.\n\n257\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.650\nThen I'm going to select Duplicates,\nno, okay?\n\n258\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.270\nSo SalesID to be able to do this, but\nnotice something else here, Vonne,\n\n259\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.750\nI kind of skipped this\non purpose last time.\n\n260\n00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.305\nBut if there's a field like,\nI take a look at this and\n\n261\n00:13:50.305 --> 00:13:53.230\nlike I really don't need quantity, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.160\nI can simply select that one and then put\nthis and tell it to skip that field and\n\n263\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.080\nthat will only import in what\nfive out of the six columns or\n\n264\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.400\nsix out of the seven columns,\ninstead, if I can count.\n\n265\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.250\nYep, so I could do that if I wanted.\n\n266\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.950\n&gt;&gt; That just put a light bulb to me,\nbecause the whole prepping our data.\n\n267\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.419\nIt's like, hey, I've got this Excel\nworksheet, and I know that I'm not gonna\n\n268\n00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:23.310\nneed columns X, Y, Z and I'm not\nsaying that is the column headings.\n\n269\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.220\nIt's just like random ones.\n\n270\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.820\nI don't need these three columns.\n\n271\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.330\nYou don't necessarily have to delete them.\n\n272\n00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.620\nYou could just skip them.\n\n273\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.673\nWow!\nOkay sorry it was just one of those like,\n\n274\n00:14:35.673 --> 00:14:37.910\nI can make less steps for myself.\n\n275\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n\n276\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.580\nAnd so if that particular Excel\nspreadsheet does need to exist\n\n277\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.460\nthen this would be a better\noption to do this.\n\n278\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.300\nBut if you know like the prompt that we\nnormally had is everything is in that\n\n279\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.960\none Excel spreadsheet.\n\n280\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.920\nAnd we're ready moving it off but then\nwhat we want to do is we kinda wanna leave\n\n281\n00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.900\nthe other ones alone and\ndo what we wanna do.\n\n282\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.790\nAnd that hopefully should get us to\nthe point where we don't need to do this.\n\n283\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.660\nBut if you do end up where you've already\nseparated it out and then you go,\n\n284\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.910\nI really don't need that column.\n\n285\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:09.280\nYou just simply select that column\nhere and then put that check there and\n\n286\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:09.980\nit won't import it.\n\n287\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.446\n&gt;&gt; At least it's nice to know\nthat it exists and I like that.\n\n288\n00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:15.670\nYay.\n\n289\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good one for\nus to think about as well okay.\n\n290\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.388\nSo even here under the SalesID, I know\nthat's not gonna be something I gonna\n\n291\n00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:28.320\ncalculate by I'm just gonna change this\nover to a short text object instead.\n\n292\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.240\nSo even though these are all numbers\nhere it's not gonna be that.\n\n293\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.020\nClick Next, from this point it's\ngonna ask me to choose a primary key.\n\n294\n00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.470\nSo I could let Access generate its own\nauto ID field right over here, but\n\n295\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.400\nI'm gonna Choose my own\nprimary key instead.\n\n296\n00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.680\nAnd that will mark this as being\nthe primary key inside of Access.\n\n297\n00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.390\nClick next, from this point on,\nI'm going to add in the name, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.745\nNow, remember on the names, I kind\nof glossed over this when we created\n\n299\n00:15:58.745 --> 00:16:02.737\nthe other one here, I'm gonna add\nthat prefix name in there, and\n\n300\n00:16:02.737 --> 00:16:05.593\nthis one is gonna be for\nSales, at this point.\n\n301\n00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:10.923\nThen I'm gonna click Finish, and\nwe should see it'll import in and\n\n302\n00:16:10.923 --> 00:16:14.247\nand I'm not gonna worry\nabout saving the steps.\n\n303\n00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:17.526\nNow if you're doing this over and over\nagain, where you are going to do this,\n\n304\n00:16:17.526 --> 00:16:19.407\nsaving the steps may\nactually help you out.\n\n305\n00:16:19.407 --> 00:16:23.548\nBut, for us it's just simple,\nand then I can go to sales table,\n\n306\n00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:26.939\nand I can verify, and\nthere's all my data in there.\n\n307\n00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:30.409\n&gt;&gt; I tried this,\ncuz you're like try it, Vonne.\n\n308\n00:16:30.409 --> 00:16:31.009\nI'm like, no!\n\n309\n00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:33.849\nI'm like, okay, fine, I'll try it, [LAUGH]\nand then when I did the save steps, cuz\n\n310\n00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:36.895\nI'm just like I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo this, it didn't really save anything.\n\n311\n00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:42.638\nIt didn't make my steps any less snappy.\n\n312\n00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:43.983\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:45.417\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just saying hey,\n\n314\n00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:49.001\nI'm gonna recognize this later on, if I\nget the same type of data, and try and\n\n315\n00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:49.733\nbring this in.\n\n316\n00:16:49.733 --> 00:16:51.520\nSo all it's gonna really do for you.\n\n317\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it didn't do much for me,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n318\n00:16:52.815 --> 00:16:55.631\n&gt;&gt; But there's obvious reasons for\nit to be there.\n\n319\n00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:59.876\nBut just in case you're like, I'm clicking\nthis, and [LAUGH] it's not doing anything?\n\n320\n00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:00.764\nI ran into the same thing, so.\n\n321\n00:17:00.764 --> 00:17:03.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here it is.\n\n322\n00:17:03.195 --> 00:17:05.700\nNow, we've got one other\nthing that we wanna show you.\n\n323\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.190\nSo, you can now see that you\ncan import in data from Excel.\n\n324\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.196\nYou can take a comma-separated value and\ndo the same thing.\n\n325\n00:17:12.196 --> 00:17:14.481\nThe key thing is what Vonne\nhas been telling you,\n\n326\n00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:16.450\npay attention to each one of those steps.\n\n327\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.880\nMake sure it makes sense\non what you're showing, and\n\n328\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.080\nwhat you're not showing as well.\n\n329\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.720\nThe last kind of thing that\nI want to show here, and\n\n330\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.320\nthen we've got a couple other things to\ntalk about, is in a previous episode where\n\n331\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.580\nwe manually created a table Vonne, so\nif you remember, we created this products\n\n332\n00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:41.400\ntable right here, where if I go to design\nview, let me go back to create here,\n\n333\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.960\nor database tools, let me see if I can,\nwhere is my design view?\n\n334\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.650\nEmployees, there it is, Table Design.\n\n335\n00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.450\nYou've created a new table.\n\n336\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.402\nI'm trying to just get\nback to design view so.\n\n337\n00:17:55.402 --> 00:17:55.945\n&gt;&gt; In the employees?\n\n338\n00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:58.954\n&gt;&gt; Let me do that, yeah,\nnot in the Employees table, the Products.\n\n339\n00:17:58.954 --> 00:17:59.530\n&gt;&gt; We're going to the products.\n\n340\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, products table, got it.\n\n341\n00:18:01.129 --> 00:18:02.645\n&gt;&gt; Products &gt; Design, right-click.\n\n342\n00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:03.437\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; Products &gt; Design.\n\n343\n00:18:03.437 --> 00:18:04.254\nYeah, right-click &gt; Design.\n&gt;&gt; You got it!\n\n344\n00:18:04.254 --> 00:18:05.463\n&gt;&gt; I was like, it's there somewhere.\n\n345\n00:18:05.463 --> 00:18:07.180\nI know it's there, but I couldn't find it.\n\n346\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.950\nSo right here, if you remember this\nis the one that we created for\n\n347\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.130\nmanual data entry where\nwe selected everything.\n\n348\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.623\nWe typed in every individual field name.\n\n349\n00:18:16.623 --> 00:18:18.797\nWe decided everyone of these data types.\n\n350\n00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:23.997\nWe even manipulated some of the field\nproperties down here to give us what\n\n351\n00:18:23.997 --> 00:18:29.364\nwe want it to, then from that point we\nswitched over to our data sheet view,\n\n352\n00:18:29.364 --> 00:18:33.795\nand then this is what I typed in\nhere about a small purple tutu,\n\n353\n00:18:33.795 --> 00:18:37.010\nis what [LAUGH] I ended up typing in here.\n\n354\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.570\nSo, there it is, I now have a table and\ndata exists in this table.\n\n355\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.080\nNow Vonne, there's two possibilities here.\n\n356\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.733\nI have, inside of my Excel workbook,\nthe actual products, but\n\n357\n00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:52.725\nI wanna test this out with some\nsample data, and now that it's there,\n\n358\n00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:56.605\nwhat do I do with the rest of the data\ninside of my Excel spreadsheet?\n\n359\n00:18:56.605 --> 00:18:58.590\nSo Vonne, what do I at that point?\n\n360\n00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.670\nWhat do you think I have to do?\n\n361\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.750\n&gt;&gt; I think we're gonna import, right?\n\n362\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.515\nAnd then we're gonna somehow tell\nit to match up with this table and\n\n363\n00:19:07.515 --> 00:19:08.887\nmatch the fields?\n\n364\n00:19:08.887 --> 00:19:10.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to a point, right?\n\n365\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.960\nThe very fact is, if I go ahead and\nimport the same data from that table,\n\n366\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.960\nit may overwrite this record,\nor it may eliminate the record.\n\n367\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.040\nSo I don't know.\n\n368\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.450\nNow, that doesn't sound bad, because for\nme, it's one record, no big deal.\n\n369\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.870\nBut Vonne, if you had, let's say, 200\nrecords in here, and you go, hey I need to\n\n370\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:37.160\nsimply add additional records in,\nfrom this table, well what will happen?\n\n371\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.487\nThe neat thing though, and the one that\nwill scare you, is if we go ahead and\n\n372\n00:19:41.487 --> 00:19:45.677\nwe do the appending of the data, and\nthis record existing in that table,\n\n373\n00:19:45.677 --> 00:19:50.576\nit's going to scare you because at the end\nit's gonna tell you it erased the record.\n\n374\n00:19:50.576 --> 00:19:55.114\nNow not exactly a big deal with 30 or\n50 rows.\n\n375\n00:19:55.114 --> 00:19:58.879\nYou can go back, and manually go in, and\ngo, I know which one it actually erased,\n\n376\n00:19:58.879 --> 00:20:00.214\nand you'll figure that out.\n\n377\n00:20:00.214 --> 00:20:05.480\nBut you have, 1,000 rows and it tells\nyou it erased, let's say, 1,000 rows,\n\n378\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.960\nlet's say it erased 1% of those,\nthat's 20 records, if my math is right.\n\n379\n00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.140\nIf that's twenty records, that, now\nbecomes a little bit harsher to try and\n\n380\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.260\ndeal with when you start to\ndo something like that now.\n\n381\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.580\nSo, instead,\nwhat we can do is we can append the data.\n\n382\n00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.160\nAppending the data works in\nthe same way as the import, but\n\n383\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.474\ninstead of overwriting the record,\nit simply adds it on to the end,\n\n384\n00:20:30.474 --> 00:20:34.540\nand that's essentially what append\nactually means for us here.\n\n385\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.240\nNow if you do end up with\na same exact duplicate record,\n\n386\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.900\nit will still delete it out, or you go no,\n\n387\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.950\ndon't do that, it won't do the import,\nwhich is kind of neat at the same time.\n\n388\n00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:50.024\nSo I already removed this particular\nrecord from the existing table, and\n\n389\n00:20:50.024 --> 00:20:54.487\nthe reason why is, cuz I just wanted us to\ndo an append without having to go through\n\n390\n00:20:54.487 --> 00:20:58.520\nall of that that we end up seeing there,\nand deal with that for right now.\n\n391\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.500\nSo all I have to do is append it.\n\n392\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.854\nNow, when you append the data,\nyou have to close out of the table.\n\n393\n00:21:04.854 --> 00:21:06.230\nIt will warn you if you don't.\n\n394\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.050\nSo save the changes for right now.\n\n395\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.630\nI'm just gonna close out of this,\nactually, I can leave those open.\n\n396\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.405\nSo I select external data,\nthis time I select\n\n397\n00:21:17.405 --> 00:21:22.557\nNew Data Source &gt; From File\n&gt; Excel file again,\n\n398\n00:21:22.557 --> 00:21:26.211\nat least that is what I am hoping.\n\n399\n00:21:26.211 --> 00:21:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's that second option on the Wizard.\n\n400\n00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.970\n&gt;&gt; There it is, the second option, yep.\n\n401\n00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:36.720\nSelect Open, and this is where we come to,\nappend a copy of the records to the table.\n\n402\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.140\nIf the specified table exists,\nAccess will add the records to the table.\n\n403\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.930\nThat's a good thing.\n\n404\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.380\nBut if the table does not exist,\nAccess will simply create it.\n\n405\n00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.360\nChanges made to the source data\nwill not be reflected here.\n\n406\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.930\nSo this time,\nI don't want to erase anything, and\n\n407\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.299\nI don't want it to create a new table.\n\n408\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.603\nI simply want to append\nthe copy to the products table,\n\n409\n00:22:02.603 --> 00:22:07.252\ncuz that's the one that I have,\nthat I said I needed to append.\n\n410\n00:22:07.252 --> 00:22:11.120\nRemember the products table is the one\nthat only had one record in it.\n\n411\n00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.515\nIf I click OK, now of course,\ngoing through the rest of the Wizard here,\n\n412\n00:22:16.515 --> 00:22:19.522\nwe can then show the products table, and\n\n413\n00:22:19.522 --> 00:22:24.916\nnow you can see all those lovely\ndescriptions, and item names that Vonne\n\n414\n00:22:24.916 --> 00:22:30.246\nactually did take a good long time in\nactually typing all that stuff in.\n\n415\n00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:32.775\nGood going, Vonne,\nlook at all that fancy data.\n\n416\n00:22:32.775 --> 00:22:33.559\n&gt;&gt; It was fun.\n[LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:34.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n418\n00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:34.564\nThere you go.\n\n419\n00:22:34.564 --> 00:22:36.491\nSo we have all that data that exist in\n\n420\n00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:41.056\nthere, and I would've cried, Vonne, if we\nhad to manually type every single one of\n\n421\n00:22:41.056 --> 00:22:44.644\nthese things in here, which you did.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I only shed a few tears.\n\n422\n00:22:44.644 --> 00:22:47.028\n[LAUGH] Of joy honestly, knowing you're\n\n423\n00:22:47.028 --> 00:22:49.754\ngonna have to talk about this stuff.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n424\n00:22:49.754 --> 00:22:51.385\nYeah, it's pretty funny.\n\n425\n00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:52.475\nSure.\n\n426\n00:22:52.475 --> 00:22:54.772\nSo I'm gonna click Next here.\n\n427\n00:22:54.772 --> 00:22:58.320\nOn this point,\nit doesn't really ask me anything else.\n\n428\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.890\nSo it doesn't even say hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n429\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.160\nIt just says the only option you have\nis Back, Next, or Finish, or Cancel.\n\n430\n00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.640\nSo go from there.\n\n431\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.364\nImport to which table?\n\n432\n00:23:10.364 --> 00:23:16.136\nWhich I have to of course do that, and\nthen click Finish, and then click Close.\n\n433\n00:23:16.136 --> 00:23:18.422\nNow remember if it sees a duplicate,\n\n434\n00:23:18.422 --> 00:23:23.363\nif it does see a duplicate record, this\nrecord already exists in the table, and\n\n435\n00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:28.550\nyou're importing in data that it doesn't,\nthe warning is really scary, [LAUGH].\n\n436\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.236\n&gt;&gt; Is it in that Wizard,\nthat you would get a warning?\n\n437\n00:23:31.236 --> 00:23:32.053\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right at the end of it.\n\n438\n00:23:32.053 --> 00:23:32.718\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n439\n00:23:32.718 --> 00:23:33.836\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right at the end of it.\n\n440\n00:23:33.836 --> 00:23:37.944\n&gt;&gt; Because we, you fixed this before we\nstarted, and we didn't get any error.\n\n441\n00:23:37.944 --> 00:23:38.503\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n442\n00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:40.319\nthe error would happen right in that-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n443\n00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:44.950\n&gt;&gt; It was like a, would it populate with\na list of where it found it, or just like,\n\n444\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.823\nI found ten?\n\n445\n00:23:45.823 --> 00:23:47.040\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, that's all it does.\n\n446\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.180\nSee, that's why it's scary.\n\n447\n00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.697\nSee, that's what I mean.\n&gt;&gt; So there's no log of results?\n\n448\n00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:54.570\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't sit there and go,\nhey, it didn't import this record in.\n\n449\n00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.534\nIt just assumes you know what\ndata you already populated and\n\n450\n00:23:57.534 --> 00:23:59.025\nyou'll know what happened.\n\n451\n00:23:59.025 --> 00:24:01.822\nSo the scary thing is not,\nlike when we had ten and\n\n452\n00:24:01.822 --> 00:24:04.823\nwe said, we erased ten records,\nit's when you go,\n\n453\n00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:08.185\nI had ten records in there,\nand it says, We erased seven.\n\n454\n00:24:08.185 --> 00:24:10.407\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It just did it.\n\n455\n00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:11.721\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it just does it.\n\n456\n00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's letting you know, but\nyou have no idea which ones they are.\n\n457\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it doesn't just do it so\nthat you're, but\n\n458\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.520\nit just gives you,\nare you sure you want to do this, right?\n\n459\n00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.690\nSo it gives you either a cancel,\n\n460\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.850\nwhich means you're gonna cancel out\nof the entire thing on the append, or\n\n461\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.440\nyou're gonna proceed forward and go,\nthat's okay, go ahead and erase those.\n\n462\n00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.579\nI would caution you to say cancel\nif you don't know what's going on.\n\n463\n00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:36.404\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so at that point you do\nhave an eject button of like no,\n\n464\n00:24:36.404 --> 00:24:39.405\nokay, we're not even gonna attempt this,\nand\n\n465\n00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:43.477\nlet's go back and maybe kinda look\nat our data a little bit more.\n\n466\n00:24:43.477 --> 00:24:44.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n467\n00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:46.010\nif you have a hundred\nthousand records is a lot.\n\n468\n00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nthat brings us to a good point, right?\n\n469\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.260\nBefore you do anything like this,\nright, save the database, okay.\n\n470\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.680\nIf you need to, make another copy\nof the database as it exists, and\n\n471\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.470\nthat is a good backup to do.\n\n472\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.680\nAnd the reason why it's actually easy\nis because an Access database is stored\n\n473\n00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.760\nas a single file.\n\n474\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So what's the harm in making the same\n\n475\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.270\ndatabase and calling it copy or\nbackup, underscore backup.\n\n476\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.150\nMake sure you do that.\n\n477\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.190\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how many\nfiles I have with like, test.\n\n478\n00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.600\nTest one, two, three, and\nthen I can't remember.\n\n479\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.160\nBut yeah,\n\n480\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.340\ndefinitely good rule of thumb for\nanything that we're doing in any product.\n\n481\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.710\nIf you're gonna make a big jump,\nmake a backup.\n\n482\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.332\nBackup, backup, backup, backup.\n\n483\n00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:26.869\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n484\n00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:28.780\nit really does help when\nsomething like that happens.\n\n485\n00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.590\nLike I said, the scary thing is not\nwhen you realize, it erased 10 records,\n\n486\n00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:38.220\nbut it's gonna give me the same thing\nback anyways cuz it didn't wanna do that.\n\n487\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.644\nBut it's when it tells you you've got\nthree records that it erased, and\n\n488\n00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:43.840\nyou don't know which three it erased.\n\n489\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.404\nSo if you go ahead and proceed, that means\nyou're gonna guess at which three is gonna\n\n490\n00:25:47.404 --> 00:25:50.270\nhappen, unless you really did\nkeep a good backup of everything,\n\n491\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.910\nunless you really know\nyour data that solidly.\n\n492\n00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:57.595\nSo once everything is done at that point,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n493\n00:25:57.595 --> 00:26:03.170\nclick on the TBL Sales,\nactually it's Products, so there we go.\n\n494\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.860\nSo I was about to show\nyou the wrong table here.\n\n495\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.049\nSo Vonne, here it is, okay.\n\n496\n00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:11.401\nThe very first table that we created\nwhen we did manual data entry,\n\n497\n00:26:11.401 --> 00:26:15.519\nwhere only one record,\neven at the beginning of this episode,\n\n498\n00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:18.939\nnow has been populated\nwith about 37 records, and\n\n499\n00:26:18.939 --> 00:26:22.970\nI can see that down here in\nthe lower left-hand corner.\n\n500\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.950\nAnd of course I can even navigate through\nthose records if I choose to, okay?\n\n501\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.230\nSo that's why we want to make sure\nthat we understand that process.\n\n502\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.680\nSo if you're ever scared about\nthe warnings that Access gives you,\n\n503\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.562\nokay, back out of it and make sure\nyou understand what is happening.\n\n504\n00:26:38.562 --> 00:26:42.490\nAnd I kind of told you, normally, if it's\na duplicate that happens, as long as you\n\n505\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:47.110\nknow that the record didn't change between\nthe time that you manually entered\n\n506\n00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:52.200\nin the data and between the time you\ndid the append, it's no big deal, okay?\n\n507\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.405\nThen you can proceed on.\n\n508\n00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:56.685\nBut if you're not sure, and\nanything that you have doubt on,\n\n509\n00:26:56.685 --> 00:27:01.110\nlosing data is just as bad as\nnot you creating it right now.\n\n510\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.810\nYou might as well not create it and\nnot lose the data, and\n\n511\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.590\nthen walk it through carefully and\n\n512\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.590\nmake sure you understand, what is the\npossible loss of data that I have here?\n\n513\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.310\nThat's gonna be because I found duplicates\nthe majority of the time, okay?\n\n514\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.830\nSo once we understand that, Vonne,\nand we take a look at it, right?\n\n515\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.360\nNow is the time you go back and\nyou check very simple things, right?\n\n516\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.300\nDid the data import correctly?\n\n517\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.940\nSo check the original CSV file,\ncheck the original Excel spreadsheet.\n\n518\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.530\nDid I have 37 records\nin the Product table?\n\n519\n00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.090\nDid I get 37 records?\n\n520\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:36.430\nIf I appended it, and I had 10 records\nin there, I should get 47, right?\n\n521\n00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.860\nSo make sure you understand\nstuff like that, okay?\n\n522\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.790\nCheck out those data types, make sure\nthey came in the way that you wanted to.\n\n523\n00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.220\nIf you set the primary key, or\nif you allowed Access at the primary key,\n\n524\n00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.600\nverify that those are set up\ninside of Design View as well.\n\n525\n00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.170\nNow Vonne, that means that we\nhave now successfully imported\n\n526\n00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.240\nin the tables that we\nhave in our database.\n\n527\n00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.768\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so we're really ready to go.\n\n528\n00:27:57.768 --> 00:28:01.223\nWe're ready to start making queries and\nlike, okay, now I'm gonna run reports and\n\n529\n00:28:01.223 --> 00:28:03.580\nit's like,\nI've got all my stuff in the tables.\n\n530\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like it, okay.\n\n531\n00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:06.170\nIt sounds like we're ready to go.\n\n532\n00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.901\n&gt;&gt; I knew there was something.\n\n533\n00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:07.693\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n534\n00:28:07.693 --> 00:28:12.561\nwe could do that if we're only willing\nto query one table at a time, but\n\n535\n00:28:12.561 --> 00:28:17.890\nI put all those tables together into\none database so that I could do what?\n\n536\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:18.520\n&gt;&gt; Wait.\n\n537\n00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.631\nI think I have the answer.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n538\n00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.467\n&gt;&gt; It's all about relations, isn't it?\n\n539\n00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:23.601\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; That's why we call it relational\n\n540\n00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:24.573\ndatabase design?\n\n541\n00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:25.808\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yep.\n\n542\n00:28:25.808 --> 00:28:26.530\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n543\n00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it allows us to build in.\n\n544\n00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.400\nOnce we create those relationships,\nwhich is the next step that we have to do,\n\n545\n00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.200\nonce we do that, then we can run a single\nquery, and then from those queries, we can\n\n546\n00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.860\nactually pull data from all the tables\ntogether once they're related together.\n\n547\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.500\nBut now they exist\nessentially as a container,\n\n548\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.670\nor Access consists as a container, but\n\n549\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.865\nnow we have to get them all connected\ntogether so they an work together.\n\n550\n00:28:48.865 --> 00:28:50.250\n&gt;&gt; Then we know how to talk to each other.\n\n551\n00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.023\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n552\n00:28:51.023 --> 00:28:54.255\nyou have to establish relationships\nto establish communication.\n\n553\n00:28:54.255 --> 00:28:54.755\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:55.255\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n555\n00:28:55.255 --> 00:28:56.603\n&gt;&gt; Well, awesome, well,\n\n556\n00:28:56.603 --> 00:29:00.777\nI think you've communicated beautifully\nhow to import information into our\n\n557\n00:29:00.777 --> 00:29:04.405\nAccess tables.\nAnd we're close to being ready to go, so\n\n558\n00:29:04.405 --> 00:29:06.727\nI'm excited to start drawing lines.\n\n559\n00:29:06.727 --> 00:29:08.493\nWe are actually going to draw lines.\n\n560\n00:29:08.493 --> 00:29:10.117\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they kinda jump together.\n\n561\n00:29:10.117 --> 00:29:10.767\nIt's kind of fun,\n\n562\n00:29:10.767 --> 00:29:12.787\nit's like a small joy I get,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n563\n00:29:12.787 --> 00:29:16.077\n&gt;&gt; Out of relations in Access.\n\n564\n00:29:16.077 --> 00:29:18.557\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nfinish this one up.\n\n565\n00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:21.244\nAnd signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n566\n00:29:21.244 --> 00:29:22.046\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n567\n00:29:22.046 --> 00:29:22.880\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n568\n00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.030\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:17.362\nI am your host Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:20.793\nwe are continuing on our\naccess 2016 essential show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:24.700\nIn this episode we are gonna be\ntalking about relationships, yehey.\n\n6\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n7\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.676\n&gt;&gt; And here to help us is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:28.256\nHello yet again.\n\n9\n00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.065\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Vonne,\n\n10\n00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:33.331\nglad to be here at OfficeProTV.\nAnd hopefully we're not setting up one of\n\n11\n00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.781\nthose websites in which we're\ntrying to get people together.\n\n12\n00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:37.285\nYou know what I mean.\n\n13\n00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:37.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yes.\n\n14\n00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:39.366\n&gt;&gt; Now, overall, though,\n\n15\n00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:44.036\ntoday we're talking about, of course,\ncreating relationships inside of access.\n\n16\n00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:46.373\nNot between people so much, but\n\n17\n00:00:46.373 --> 00:00:48.948\nbetween tables.\nSo, believe it or not,\n\n18\n00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.894\ngetting tables together to be able to\nrelate, is a lot easier than getting\n\n19\n00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:56.373\npeople together to relate as well.\nSo, it should be fun at the same time it\n\n20\n00:00:56.373 --> 00:00:59.166\nshould be easier.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but it does almost sound like\n\n21\n00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:03.312\na dating app or whatever.\nWe need to make sure that the employees\n\n22\n00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.512\ntalk to the customers,\ntalk to the products.\n\n23\n00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:08.267\nAnd so we need to establish those\n\n24\n00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:13.064\nconnections and like, do we have a match?\nYes we do, yay.\n\n25\n00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:15.663\nWe can go on our life and be happy.\n\n26\n00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:16.669\n[LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:18.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it does sound that way and\n\n28\n00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:20.617\nyou hate to say it.\nThe database designers never\n\n29\n00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:24.845\nprobably thought about the idea of the\nrealm that we've gotten into in terms of\n\n30\n00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:28.196\nthose apps that allow us to add\nthose types of relationships.\n\n31\n00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:30.172\nSo that's probably why they still use\n\n32\n00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:31.506\nthose terms.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:32.504\n&gt;&gt; They probably thought it was gonna be\n\n34\n00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:35.297\nunambiguous.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, if you mix match things,\n\n35\n00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:38.166\nif things don't properly\nrelate to each other.\n\n36\n00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.282\nThen you're gonna have some conflict.\n\n37\n00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:41.259\nWow, we can keep on going with this.\n\n38\n00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:41.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n39\n00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:42.475\n&gt;&gt; But it is true,\n\n40\n00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:44.354\nlike if they don't match up.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n41\n00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.289\n&gt;&gt; Then the data's not gonna talk\n\n42\n00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.987\nto each other.\n&gt;&gt; Incompatible, that's right, yeah.\n\n43\n00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:48.169\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you've got to be compatible.\n\n44\n00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.503\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n45\n00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:51.218\nThat first dating thing that happens.\n\n46\n00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:52.334\nYou don't have to match it,\n\n47\n00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.045\nit just doesn't work.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n48\n00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:55.101\n&gt;&gt; Well, the same thing happens of\n\n49\n00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.377\ncourse then in databases.\nAnd so\n\n50\n00:01:56.377 --> 00:02:01.136\nwe have to talk about that idea of and\nnow that we have all of the data, right?\n\n51\n00:02:01.136 --> 00:02:03.951\nThat's inside of our access database\n\n52\n00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:08.337\nthe way that we want them to be.\nWhich means that the data is stored\n\n53\n00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.446\nin tables and\nwe've taken the time to create that,\n\n54\n00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:12.069\nright?\nSo\n\n55\n00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.581\nwe've showed you how to actually\ncreate those tables and\n\n56\n00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:19.055\nnow they're inside of my access database.\nNow we have to kinda take a step backward,\n\n57\n00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.689\nokay?\nGetting the data in is good, and\n\n58\n00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.903\nnow we have that.\nNow if we don't establish table\n\n59\n00:02:24.903 --> 00:02:28.784\nrelationships, okay?\nWhat is the result of what I can do inside\n\n60\n00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:31.308\nof Access?\nAnd that's what I have to ask Vonne as\n\n61\n00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:33.048\nwell, okay?\nDoes that mean that Access is\n\n62\n00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:35.496\ncompletely useless on that point?\nNo, okay?\n\n63\n00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:38.079\nYou can still use all those other tools\n\n64\n00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.939\nthat you have in Access, even if you\nhave multiple tables inside of it.\n\n65\n00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.626\nCan I still run queries?\n\n66\n00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:45.480\nYes, Vonne,\n\n67\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.168\nyou can actually still run queries.\nWhen you run a query, it's really going\n\n68\n00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:54.553\nto be on one table at a time, okay?\nSo, we can do something like that if we\n\n69\n00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:57.466\nchoose to, okay?\nEach and every individual table,\n\n70\n00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:00.640\nas long as the only data I'm looking for\nis within that table,\n\n71\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.790\nthen I can run queries all day long.\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of harking back to\n\n72\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.213\nthe vocabulary episode that we\ndid where we had a query and\n\n73\n00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:12.951\na select query.\nAnd that's where, okay, just a single\n\n74\n00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:17.656\ntable, a single query, that's fine.\nBut if you're gonna talk about all\n\n75\n00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:22.649\nthis information of splitting them up\ninto tables, you have to be able to get\n\n76\n00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.705\nthe tables to talk to each other\nto be able to pull from one, and\n\n77\n00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:31.317\npull from the other.\nSo, that's what the true way that we want\n\n78\n00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:35.482\nto use this relational database tool.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n79\n00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:40.178\nif you take a look at this idea, right?\nThe only way that we can clear for\n\n80\n00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:43.447\nmore than one particular table\nat a time is simple, okay?\n\n81\n00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:45.336\nWe have to find a way to make those\n\n82\n00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:49.957\ntables to connect And when you get into\nthe relational database design class,\n\n83\n00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:53.387\nyou'll talk about this idea\nof what that actually means,\n\n84\n00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:58.030\nand how that ends up working out together.\nBut for us, it's as simple as that,\n\n85\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.066\nwhere do they match?\nAnd for us,\n\n86\n00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:05.126\nit's gonna be on the idea of different\nfields that we have the matches for.\n\n87\n00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.098\nAnd that's what we want to get to,\n\n88\n00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:10.232\nis to understand that\nparticular idea as well, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:12.104\nSo Vonne if I don't do this,\n\n90\n00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:16.705\nin other words if I don't create\nthose relationships, it means that I\n\n91\n00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:20.753\nshould just stick with Excel, okay?\nCuz I'm pretty much doing\n\n92\n00:04:20.753 --> 00:04:22.761\nexactly what Excel does.\nI'm just\n\n93\n00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:26.238\nreally querying from one table anyways,\nwhen I'm doing that search for\n\n94\n00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:29.145\nsomething inside of Excel I should\njust do that and not have to\n\n95\n00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.523\nworry about anything else that's there.\nBut,\n\n96\n00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:35.205\nif I know that I need to store the data so\nit's scalable, it can grow,\n\n97\n00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:38.831\nit can do what I need to.\nAnd be able to query from multiple tables\n\n98\n00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:43.248\nand get the results that I want to then\nit means I have to establish those table\n\n99\n00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:44.491\nrelationships.\nAnd\n\n100\n00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.419\nthis is probably one of the most\nimportant aspects that we can work on and\n\n101\n00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.575\ntake the time to learn about.\nBecause if we do it wrong we\n\n102\n00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:54.953\nare definitely not gonna get\nresults that we want, okay?\n\n103\n00:04:54.953 --> 00:04:56.745\nAnd after we established a table\n\n104\n00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:01.479\nrelationship there, okay?\nIt's gonna be much more difficult to\n\n105\n00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.455\nchange them.\nSo it's not that you can't but\n\n106\n00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:09.206\nit becomes much more difficult to change\nthem after we start entering in new data.\n\n107\n00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:11.344\nSo it's very important that we get it\n\n108\n00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:15.785\nright from the beginning if we can, okay?\nBut the great thing is as long as we do\n\n109\n00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:18.386\nnot enter any more data\nwe can now take the time,\n\n110\n00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:22.662\neven after establishing relationships.\nAnd while the data amount is small,\n\n111\n00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:26.933\nwe can change them as long as we are not\ncontinuing to add data into it right now.\n\n112\n00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:28.931\nSo, it gives us a little bit of test and\n\n113\n00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.566\ntime to kind of prove that\neverything is working.\n\n114\n00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:33.154\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're saying we're gonna\n\n115\n00:05:33.154 --> 00:05:35.936\nestablish the, we've gotten all\nthe information to the tables,\n\n116\n00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.786\nthen you establish the relationship.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n117\n00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:39.930\n&gt;&gt; Or could you make your tables,\n\n118\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.123\nnot put any data into it, and\nestablish the relationships then, I guess,\n\n119\n00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:48.610\nor maybe I'm kinda confusing my steps.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n120\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:50.134\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you can do it either way.\n\n122\n00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:50.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n123\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.369\n&gt;&gt; So I can actually\n\n124\n00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:54.519\npre-populate the tables if I want to and\nthen create the relationships,\n\n125\n00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.815\ncuz that's what we're doing here, okay?\nOr I can just build the entire database\n\n126\n00:05:58.815 --> 00:06:01.622\nfrom scratch without any data into them.\nAnd\n\n127\n00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:05.044\ncreate the relationships the way\nthat I think they're gonna work and\n\n128\n00:06:05.044 --> 00:06:06.508\npopulate them as well.\nSo,\n\n129\n00:06:06.508 --> 00:06:11.346\nit just depends on what you choose to do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but you could also, if later down\n\n130\n00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:16.467\nthe road I need another table, you could\nstill go ahead and add another table but\n\n131\n00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:19.194\nthen connect the relationship.\nSo it's not like,\n\n132\n00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:21.260\nokay once you have got everything and\nyour established,\n\n133\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.220\nyou can't go any further\n&gt;&gt; Nope\n\n134\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.468\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I just wanted to make sure\n\n135\n00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:25.739\nI was understanding that right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can,\n\n136\n00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:30.088\nit does take a little bit of time to\nget everything caught up though, okay?\n\n137\n00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:31.728\nSo you have to make sure that everything\n\n138\n00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:34.321\nis connected the way that you\nthink it's gonna be connected.\n\n139\n00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:36.120\nBut normally adding in a table\n\n140\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.872\nafter the fact is probably harder than\nyou think, especially if there's data\n\n141\n00:06:40.872 --> 00:06:45.126\nentry still going on as you go.\nI now need to add this in there, okay?\n\n142\n00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:45.900\nSo normally,\n\n143\n00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.895\nif you have a time during that planning\nand during this initial stage where\n\n144\n00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:53.761\nyou have a relatively small amount of\ndata where you can make changes and\n\n145\n00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:57.884\nsee whether or not those changes are gonna\naffect the rest that you wanna take\n\n146\n00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:00.995\nthe time to do this, okay?\nSo that's what we're actually\n\n147\n00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:04.350\ntaking a look at as well, okay?\nNow the other thing I wanted to point out\n\n148\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.006\nis that if we don't establish\nthese relationship, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.866\nIt also means things like data entry.\n\n150\n00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:10.820\nWhen we do this, we have to actually have\n\n151\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.709\nto enter it in for every single table.\nSo let's take, for an example Vonne,\n\n152\n00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:20.320\nif we wanted to, enter in data for\nour entire database, and\n\n153\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.891\nwe had data in multiple tables, right?\nIt means I have to actually go and\n\n154\n00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:27.515\nopen this one table, and\nenter that piece of information,\n\n155\n00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:31.150\nopen the second table add that in there,\nopen the third table, add that in there.\n\n156\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.126\nIt means I can't use forms to populate all\n\n157\n00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:36.658\nof them too.\nThe same things with the reports that\n\n158\n00:07:36.658 --> 00:07:40.785\nare generated, it can't be done.\nSo in this aspect, establishing those\n\n159\n00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:45.633\ntable relationships really does help\naccess to work properly the way that\n\n160\n00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:50.479\nit needs to, to get the information\nfrom those multiple tables and to help\n\n161\n00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:54.962\nus as we continue to grow with the data.\n&gt;&gt; So, this is the sign of good,\n\n162\n00:07:54.962 --> 00:07:58.364\na very key concept [LAUGH] right?\nCuz unlike, wow,\n\n163\n00:07:58.364 --> 00:08:01.447\nI'm getting that this is very important.\n[LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.269\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it really is important, so\n\n165\n00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:07.889\nwhen we begin, let's remember there's some\nfundamental things that we have to pay\n\n166\n00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:11.225\nattention to as we start here.\nWhich are the idea of how those\n\n167\n00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:15.598\nrelationship works and what are those\nprimary things that we want to remember as\n\n168\n00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:18.465\nwe do this.\nSo let's start off by using what we have\n\n169\n00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:21.150\navailable to us, and we'll take\na look at my screen there, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.140\nSo inside of OneNote, this is where Vonne\nand I started off with the planning and\n\n171\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.140\ndesign of this database, and we came up\nwith different tables and, of course,\n\n172\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.020\nthe fields that are actually\nin these different tables.\n\n173\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.990\nNow, later on as we progressed through\nthis, we started to add in a few things,\n\n174\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.070\nand I even removed a few items as\nI started to go through as well.\n\n175\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those were the cross-outs\nif you see things with strike-throughs.\n\n176\n00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:45.810\nWow, that was a hard sentence to say.\n\n177\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.727\nThat was because he tasked me to go ahead\nget it how you would organize this,\n\n178\n00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:53.164\nand so I started to put some stuff in.\n\n179\n00:08:53.164 --> 00:08:56.810\nAnd then you're like, we'll actually don't\nneed this in this table because that\n\n180\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.500\nwould be a separate one, and so that's\nwhy it was more of I put it all down,\n\n181\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.025\nwe went through it together, and you\nchecked my homework for me there, Ronnie.\n\n182\n00:09:06.025 --> 00:09:08.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we have to do that, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.930\nAnd as we establish these\ntypes of relationships,\n\n184\n00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.170\nyou really have to establish\nthem logically at first.\n\n185\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.660\nAnd then what we're gonna do is,\nwhat I would normally do,\n\n186\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.940\nis I would print something like this out\non paper and then start using pencil.\n\n187\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.770\nGood advice from Vonne.\n\n188\n00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.240\nUse pencil to draw the linking\nrelationships, and then try and\n\n189\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.450\nfigure out what relationship\nthey're really in.\n\n190\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.290\nThe great thing is in Access,\n\n191\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.500\nas long as you can link them where\nyou think you can link them,\n\n192\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.475\nit will normally say, here's the type\nof relationship I see with this link.\n\n193\n00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:40.865\nSo you don't even have to decide that, but\n\n194\n00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:43.615\nunderstanding those relationships\nare really gonna be key.\n\n195\n00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:44.945\n&gt;&gt; And I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n196\n00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:47.663\nplug OneNote right here,\nbecause this is a really cool product.\n\n197\n00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:52.646\nAnd so we drew the lines and\neverything right here in OneNote, so\n\n198\n00:09:52.646 --> 00:09:54.872\nit's like a digital paper.\n\n199\n00:09:54.872 --> 00:09:59.110\nIf you're like, really, well,\nwe have shows on that too, so [LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.130\nI just really like this product [LAUGH].\n\n201\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.940\n&gt;&gt; And so it's a great product\nto at least help us, but\n\n202\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.280\nI wanted something that you didn't have to\nread my handwriting, which is atrocious.\n\n203\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.690\nBut it allows us to do that.\n\n204\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.170\nSo notice that we have\nmultiple tables here.\n\n205\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.242\nWe have the customer's table,\nwe have the sales table, and\n\n206\n00:10:14.242 --> 00:10:17.268\nI was gonna mark the primary\nkey on that sales table, okay?\n\n207\n00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:20.651\nThe product's table over here,\nas I scroll on over.\n\n208\n00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:27.441\nYou see the stores, employee demo info,\nand then employee or the store inventory.\n\n209\n00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:32.828\n&gt;&gt; So we need the primary key on the item\nnumber in the inventory, the planning.\n\n210\n00:10:32.828 --> 00:10:34.605\nSorry, that's I can see store inventory.\n\n211\n00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:36.230\nWe were on planning that out, sorry.\n\n212\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.808\nI was just looking for\nasterisk, like, nice ones.\n\n213\n00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:39.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n214\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.993\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Getting ahead of myself.\n\n215\n00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:44.013\n&gt;&gt; Well, I left that in here because\nI wanted to talk about something that\n\n216\n00:10:44.013 --> 00:10:47.495\nnormally ends up happening during your\nplanning stage even at the very beginning\n\n217\n00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:48.976\nwhich is-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is what I did.\n\n218\n00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:49.974\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n219\n00:10:49.974 --> 00:10:50.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n220\n00:10:50.744 --> 00:10:52.888\nI am reminding myself\nof what I did [LAUGH].\n\n221\n00:10:52.888 --> 00:10:53.898\n&gt;&gt; Which is fine.\n\n222\n00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:57.497\nSo sometimes you may end up finding out\nthat you plan all these tables out,\n\n223\n00:10:57.497 --> 00:10:59.620\nand you don't really need them.\n\n224\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.400\nSometimes you do need them, and\nyou bring it back in, so left that, and\n\n225\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.570\nwe put it inside of planning,\nlike we said.\n\n226\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.130\nMaybe we'll use this, maybe we won't,\n\n227\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.780\nbut let's go ahead and take a look at how\nwe established this relationships, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.252\nSo I don't know why I keep creating\nthese text boxes, I'm trying not to.\n\n229\n00:11:15.252 --> 00:11:17.892\n&gt;&gt; It's anytime you click at things,\nthat is you wanna type on the paper,\n\n230\n00:11:17.892 --> 00:11:20.769\nor write something, so it's making\na new text box, that's all [INAUDIBLE].\n\n231\n00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so let's start of here\nby taking a look at just a couple of items\n\n232\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.885\ntowards the top of the screen here, okay?\n\n233\n00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:31.944\nSo as we start to take a look\nat this particular database,\n\n234\n00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:35.001\nbetween customers and products, right?\n\n235\n00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:40.876\nIf I'm keeping track of this, what\ncustomers bought which products, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:40.876 --> 00:11:42.978\nLogically, I have to think this out, okay?\n\n237\n00:11:42.978 --> 00:11:47.680\nHow do I actually get that\nconnected to one another?\n\n238\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.843\nSo a customer, for\nhim to get that product,\n\n239\n00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:56.074\nI say that he has to actually go through\na sale to get that product, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:56.074 --> 00:11:59.527\nSo that's just the logic that\nI'm using at this point.\n\n241\n00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:03.177\nSomebody else might use a different logic,\nbut at least for me,\n\n242\n00:12:03.177 --> 00:12:06.098\nthis is what I have in my\nmind that I'm going to use.\n\n243\n00:12:06.098 --> 00:12:10.882\nSo if I'm actually selling\nDancing Dogs Incorporated stuff,\n\n244\n00:12:10.882 --> 00:12:15.755\nwell, I want my customers to be\nable to get access to the products\n\n245\n00:12:15.755 --> 00:12:21.400\nby them giving me money,\nwhich is a sale is what would occur here.\n\n246\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.220\nSo for me to do that, I want to link\nthe customers to the sales table, and\n\n247\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.700\nthen the sales table over to the products\ntable for right now is what I want to do.\n\n248\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.070\nSo if you had this on a piece of paper,\nI'm gonna use a drawing tool here for\n\n249\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.900\na moment, and I'm gonna choose the blue\ncolor cuz I think it shows up.\n\n250\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.600\nI could be wrong.\n\n251\n00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.534\nSo here in the sales table,\nI've also added in this CustomerID field,\n\n252\n00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:53.426\nand its real purpose is to become\na foreign key inside of the sales table,\n\n253\n00:12:53.426 --> 00:13:00.374\nso that when I click here,\nI can just simply do that.\n\n254\n00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:04.777\nNow, this is not doing anything in Access\nyet, but it's better if you write this out\n\n255\n00:13:04.777 --> 00:13:07.398\nbefore you try it inside\nof Access to help you out.\n\n256\n00:13:07.398 --> 00:13:13.204\nSo once I do that, now I want to\ntake a moment here to also try and\n\n257\n00:13:13.204 --> 00:13:18.140\nestablish what type of\nrelationship this might be.\n\n258\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.270\nSo I should be able to have a single\n\n259\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.250\ncustomer over here in this\ntable on the left-hand side.\n\n260\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:32.750\nThat could possibly have one sale or\nmultiple sales, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.040\nIn that type of relationship, the way that\nwe would actually make that is that we\n\n262\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.730\nwould say a single record in\nthe customer's table could have\n\n263\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:48.160\nminimum of one, but it could have multiple\nrecords over here in the sales table.\n\n264\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.090\nAnd I'm trying to draw the infinity symbol\nbecause that's how it's actually drawn in\n\n265\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.560\nAccess, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.230\nSo when I make that linking relationship,\nwhat am I expecting to see?\n\n267\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.020\nI'm expecting to see\nthat in the sales table\n\n268\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.620\nthat the customer ID could\nappear multiple times, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.610\nOr it could only appear one time,\nbut it can happen.\n\n270\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.140\nAnd that's because in the sales,\nit could be the customer comes back two or\n\n271\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.870\nthree times.\n\n272\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.850\nCould appear multiple times in a week.\n\n273\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.380\nCould come back four times in that\nsame day if they wanted to or\n\n274\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.610\ncould buy one time that's\nperfectly fine with me.\n\n275\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.190\nNow, the other thing,\nthough, is the product.\n\n276\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.260\nWell, a sale normally\nconsists of products.\n\n277\n00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.850\nWell, if I do this particular item here,\n\n278\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.070\nthis is where I have to figure out,\nI didn't add in the, and\n\n279\n00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:36.050\nthat's where you start to realize you\nmight be missing some things, right?\n\n280\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:40.460\nSo notice, I'm not actually there\nwhere I'm looking for the item number,\n\n281\n00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.920\nand that's what I also need in here, too.\n\n282\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.310\nSo if I now add an item number instead,\n\n283\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.300\nthat will help me out\nif the products table.\n\n284\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.080\nSo there's another foreign\nkey that I'm adding in.\n\n285\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.230\nAt least that's what I think I am.\n\n286\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.910\nActually, I've done it differently here.\n\n287\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.430\nSo I was trying to think\nof what I did here,\n\n288\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.200\nand this is where it becomes\na little bit different.\n\n289\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.030\nSo let me change that up,\ncuz if I just do that, for a moment, I'm\n\n290\n00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.760\nonly gonna be allowed to sell one item per\nsale, and that's not gonna work for me.\n\n291\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.250\nSo let's take one example, a single sale\ncould have what multiple products, right?\n\n292\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.490\nBut at the same time, multiple sales from\nmultiple customers could also buy what?\n\n293\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.360\nMultiple products, too.\n\n294\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.330\nSo this particular direct relationship,\nif we try to do that just by item number,\n\n295\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.090\nit would actually be a many\nto many relationship.\n\n296\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.350\nMultiple records in sales\ntable could match up to\n\n297\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.330\nmultiple records in the products table.\n\n298\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:43.370\nNow, that is a valid relationship in every\nsingle database that exists out there,\n\n299\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.360\nbut it's not valid inside\nof Access [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.503\nSo this is one of those where it's\na little bit more unusual, and\n\n301\n00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:55.437\nwe're gonna get more into this\ninside of advanced access, right?\n\n302\n00:15:55.437 --> 00:16:01.390\nNow, what I would have to do here\nis I would have to create a table,\n\n303\n00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.498\nso we'll call this one TBL SalesItems,\nat this point.\n\n304\n00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:07.820\nAnd in theSalesItem.\n\n305\n00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:18.369\nI would actually have SalesID and\nthen ItemNumber.\n\n306\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.260\nAnd the primary key in this\none though would be different.\n\n307\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.940\nIt'd be what we call\na combined primary key.\n\n308\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.110\nOr a multiple field primary key.\n\n309\n00:16:36.084 --> 00:16:40.150\nIn Access,\nthey call that a junction table, okay?\n\n310\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.010\nNow, we're not getting into\njunction tables right yet.\n\n311\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.310\nBut if I wanted to do this correctly,\nthis is what I would have to create.\n\n312\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.440\nSo sometimes when you do\nestablish this relationship,\n\n313\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.080\nthis is what would have to happen here.\n\n314\n00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.720\nSo at this point, let me go back and\ncreate this relationship,\n\n315\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.130\nwhere I have a single sale that\nwill go to the salesID here.\n\n316\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.800\nAnd then the item number\nto the item number here,\n\n317\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.310\nin this particular sales table.\n\n318\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.300\nThen I can have multiple sales with\nmultiple items that would be unique.\n\n319\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.450\nSo I could have a salesID of\none with the product ID of ten.\n\n320\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.550\nSix or seven times if I wanted to.\n\n321\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.670\nBut it's probably not\ngonna happen like that.\n\n322\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.100\nSo you will end up seeing\nsomething like that,\n\n323\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.790\nas long as it's actually\ngoing to be not identical.\n\n324\n00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.920\nSo you can do this, and\nthen this way it actually links.\n\n325\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.840\nAnd this is where now\nyou'll actually have a 1.\n\n326\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.030\nOops, put the wrong color there.\n\n327\n00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:43.630\nI've deleted the whole thing, go figure.\n\n328\n00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:48.354\nThis is where we need a 1.\n\n329\n00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:55.112\nAnd this one will be to a many,\nand this one will also be a,\n\n330\n00:17:55.112 --> 00:17:58.480\nthis is a many, and go backward here.\n\n331\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.963\nAnd this would be a 1.\n\n332\n00:18:03.963 --> 00:18:07.500\nNow, if you're wondering this\nabout the two primary keys here.\n\n333\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.930\nWell, what's gonna happen is that,\nwhen they actually relate here,\n\n334\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:16.220\nthis will actually appear\nmultiple times in this table.\n\n335\n00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.460\nBut this one will actually appear\nmultiple times in this table as well, but\n\n336\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.310\nthey won't appear in that same combination\nmultiple times, only appear one time.\n\n337\n00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.830\nSo, that's what will happen there.\n\n338\n00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.710\nAnd like I said, I'm getting a little bit\nmore complicated, but at this point we're\n\n339\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.840\ngonna actually kind of bypass that\na little bit to try and make it work.\n\n340\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.430\n&gt;&gt; I think it just kind of\ndid a little click you mean,\n\n341\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.780\ncuz I was a little kind of hmm,\nwhere are we going.\n\n342\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.550\nBut if we try to keep this in a real\nlife situation where I'm gonna go up to\n\n343\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:47.820\nthe counter, and I am buying a tutu,\nI'm buying four cans of dog food,\n\n344\n00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.170\nand a whatever.\n\n345\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.260\nSo I have different items,\nbut it's one sale.\n\n346\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.729\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's my,\n\n347\n00:18:54.729 --> 00:18:57.930\nin this table sale that is a SalesID.\n\n348\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:58.500\nThat's one.\n\n349\n00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.907\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But since I had multiple items.\n\n350\n00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n351\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.247\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nThen that's where the table's cell item\n\n352\n00:19:05.247 --> 00:19:10.760\ncomes in, cuz then it's gonna have my\nSalesID, and that could be multiple times.\n\n353\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.177\nBut, the item number that's with\nthat SalesID, it will be 22 and\n\n354\n00:19:15.177 --> 00:19:17.050\nthen same SalesID and then.\n\n355\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:17.800\n&gt;&gt; Color.\n\n356\n00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Color, there you go.\n\n357\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then, the same SalesID, but\n\n358\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.030\nthen the-\n&gt;&gt; Dog food.\n\n359\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.667\n&gt;&gt; Dog food, so that is where they\nbecome unique in the pairing.\n\n360\n00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:28.601\n&gt;&gt; In the pairing.\n\n361\n00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Wow, and then where we're getting,\nwell the dog collar.\n\n362\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.770\nThat's the connection over into\nthe products of the manufacturer.\n\n363\n00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:40.085\nAll right.\n\n364\n00:19:40.085 --> 00:19:45.102\nAnd then back on that table Sales,\nthe CustomerID.\n\n365\n00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:48.520\nThat goes over to our\ncustomer loyalty program.\n\n366\n00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.468\nTo where if you're\na customer in the program.\n\n367\n00:19:52.468 --> 00:19:57.021\nThen I can associate that\nSalesID with your CustomerID.\n\n368\n00:19:57.021 --> 00:20:03.205\nBecause actual record of the people\nin the MVP group whatever.\n\n369\n00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:07.671\nBut also in that same SalesID if I'm\nnot part of the loyalty program,\n\n370\n00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:09.500\nthat could be blank.\n\n371\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Could.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's still a sale.\n\n372\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz maybe you're\n\n373\n00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.770\nnot in the MVP program.\n\n374\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.380\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n375\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.790\n&gt;&gt; So you're still a sale.\n\n376\n00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you're not a customer.\n\n377\n00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:17.780\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n378\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.016\n&gt;&gt; All right. Wow. [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n379\n00:20:19.016 --> 00:20:21.620\nSo, I had to break it down when I go,\ncuz I do the same thing.\n\n380\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.220\nI buy my collars, and I buy my pet food,\nand I just had to kinda relate it back.\n\n381\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.526\nCuz, I was getting slightly lost there for\na [LAUGH] second Ronnie,\n\n382\n00:20:31.526 --> 00:20:35.051\nbut I explained it properly and\nin my terms?\n\n383\n00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:39.128\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we'll see that, like I said\nit's more of an advanced level thing,\n\n384\n00:20:39.128 --> 00:20:43.079\nbut to make this work realistically,\nthis is what you have to do when you end\n\n385\n00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:45.930\nup with a many to many\nrelationship inside of Access.\n\n386\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.683\nYou have to create something, and\n\n387\n00:20:47.683 --> 00:20:51.144\nI marked it with JT right here\nwhich means junction table.\n\n388\n00:20:51.144 --> 00:20:51.951\nIt's not Justin Timberlake?\n\n389\n00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:53.610\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not Justin Timberlake.\n\n390\n00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, as sad as that is, yes.\n\n391\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, and that's where I'm\nthinking of it in a real life situation,\n\n392\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.520\nI'd put this all in one worksheet.\n\n393\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.380\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or, I'm using excel, but\n\n394\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.010\nthat's where having to kinda break it up,\n\n395\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.840\nand it does take a little bit\nof practice to think about it.\n\n396\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.490\nAnd like you said,\nthis kinda junction table,\n\n397\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.240\nwe are throwing a slight\ncurve ball in there.\n\n398\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.680\nOf kind of going into\na more advanced concept\n\n399\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.300\nof database design with junction table.\n\n400\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.400\nYou're like, what's a junction table?\n\n401\n00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.820\nDon't totally really concern yourself with\nthat, but like you're saying, it's having\n\n402\n00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:35.150\nto make those relationships, and how\nyou really do have to break it all out.\n\n403\n00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.561\nAnd it's a different way of thinking.\n\n404\n00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:39.180\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n405\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.030\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm still wrapping\nmy head around it, so.\n\n406\n00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.873\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes a little bit of time,\n\n407\n00:21:43.873 --> 00:21:46.750\nbut this is the most realistic\nway to make that work out.\n\n408\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.409\nBut it is a demonstration\non what has to be done,\n\n409\n00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:51.808\nwhen you have a many to many relationship.\n\n410\n00:21:51.808 --> 00:21:54.832\nMultiple customers can buy\nmultiple products, but\n\n411\n00:21:54.832 --> 00:21:59.161\nin Access it doesn't allow you to do\na direct many to many relationship, so\n\n412\n00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:01.791\nyou have to break it up\nhere to make that work.\n\n413\n00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:03.690\n&gt;&gt; And it is a single sale.\n\n414\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.480\nThis is the sale that is being\nrung up at the register,\n\n415\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.270\nwith multiple items on that receipt.\n\n416\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.460\nAnd how it all pulls it all together.\n\n417\n00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.910\nSo that's, yeah.\n\n418\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.400\nYou gotta break it down and\nit's difficult.\n\n419\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does work, it's just you\nhave to take a moments here okay.\n\n420\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.090\nNow the other thing, is I wanna also\nget the store number out of this.\n\n421\n00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:29.200\nSo I already made the connection here,\nand this can actually say hey,\n\n422\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.210\nin the products table,\nthose parts could be in may stores.\n\n423\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.580\nBut then there's only one store number.\n\n424\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.330\nNow, remember we're not actually doing\nanything in Access right now, but we're\n\n425\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:43.290\nlogically planning this thing out, so that\nwe know what's also going to happen, okay?\n\n426\n00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.480\nNow if I scroll down a little bit,\n\n427\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.680\nI'm going to link that\nCustomerID here that loyalty ID.\n\n428\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Down to the customer pets,\nif I can do this.\n\n429\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.190\nAnd that's because Vonne wanted\nto establish his loyalty program.\n\n430\n00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.470\nI can't do that apparently.\n\n431\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.830\nIt doesn't allow me to do that.\n\n432\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.400\nI'll have to do it from the other side.\n\n433\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.330\nSo let's do it over here instead.\n\n434\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.083\nI'll kinda snake that around and do that.\n\n435\n00:23:10.083 --> 00:23:14.877\n&gt;&gt; Because this is where,\nif I'm part of the loyalty program,\n\n436\n00:23:14.877 --> 00:23:17.229\nthen I have my own loyalty ID.\n\n437\n00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:17.824\n&gt;&gt; Loyalty number, right.\n\n438\n00:23:17.824 --> 00:23:21.935\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's different from the CustomerID,\n\n439\n00:23:21.935 --> 00:23:29.100\ncuz that's where we want to make sure\nthat it's connected down into the pets.\n\n440\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.290\nAnd that's where we had\nto make that connection.\n\n441\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, but that also means,\njust like what you're talking about,\n\n442\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.620\nif I'm not part of the loyalty\nprogram I don't get an ID.\n\n443\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.435\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we want to do this.\n\n445\n00:23:38.435 --> 00:23:42.490\nCuz even though you're only gonna\nsee the loyalty ID one time up here,\n\n446\n00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.990\nremember that they could\nhave multiple pets.\n\n447\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.110\nThat single loyalty customer\ncould have multiple pets.\n\n448\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.831\nAnd that's what we also\nwant to establish too.\n\n449\n00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:51.157\n&gt;&gt; And that's when I was doing\nthe planning, I was like,\n\n450\n00:23:51.157 --> 00:23:53.746\nokay we'll go ahead and\nput all the pets into this one table.\n\n451\n00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:57.187\nWe're gonna have a customer loyalty and\ntheir pets, then I was like, wait.\n\n452\n00:23:57.187 --> 00:24:01.237\nThey can have three dogs,\nthey could have one dog.\n\n453\n00:24:01.237 --> 00:24:05.651\nAnd so that's the breaking it back out\njust kind of the same way that I was\n\n454\n00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:11.420\nexplaining it in my terminology with\nthe number, one sale, multiple items.\n\n455\n00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.890\nOne customer loyalty ID, or\none loyalty ID, multiple pets.\n\n456\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's kind of the key here\nis to make sure that you're logically\n\n457\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.226\nfiguring this out when you\nmake those connections.\n\n458\n00:24:23.226 --> 00:24:28.350\nNow, I'm going to leave the store\ninventory here, and the reason why is,\n\n459\n00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:32.120\nthat you find out, just, a couple of other\nthings, as you're working through this.\n\n460\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.080\nYou might find out that this is too big,\n\n461\n00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.000\noutside of the scope of\nyour particular database.\n\n462\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.900\nAnd that's what I ended up discovering is\nthat I would literally have to kind of\n\n463\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.530\ncreate, just kind of a whole\nother structure to make\n\n464\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.520\nthe inventory happen the way\nthat I wanted it to happen.\n\n465\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.360\nWhich is,\nif a customer bought six of these items,\n\n466\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.220\nto make sure that we also subtracted from\nthe actual inventory to make that happen.\n\n467\n00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.200\nAnd it's just a long,\ndrawn out process for this point here.\n\n468\n00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.300\nIt's not that it can't be done, I'm saying\nthat now, it just means that right now\n\n469\n00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.700\nI'm not going to deal with it so I'm\nsimply going to remove that for right now.\n\n470\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.180\nI still want to connect\nthe employee's information, and\n\n471\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.654\nI have a couple of different\nways that I am going to do this.\n\n472\n00:25:11.654 --> 00:25:14.790\nI'm going to select from the sales table,\n\n473\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.080\nbecause we want to find out who sold what,\nright here.\n\n474\n00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.050\nAnd then that means over here in\nthe sales table, I can have that employee\n\n475\n00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.070\nselling multiple times, but\nthe employees table it's only one time.\n\n476\n00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:33.960\nThe other thing that I also want to\nconnect to, is that on the manager ID for\n\n477\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.628\nthe store, and he's actually just\nan employee as well, I also want to link\n\n478\n00:25:39.628 --> 00:25:45.460\nthis over here.\n\n479\n00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.450\nNow this is actually a one to\none relationship on this one.\n\n480\n00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.800\nBecause that manager ID is not going to\nappear more than one time in this table.\n\n481\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.350\nAnd, of course, oops, I started doing\nthe other one, let me back up here.\n\n482\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.150\nAnd this one is actually\ngoing to be a one to one.\n\n483\n00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.290\nNow, normally when you\nsee that one to one,\n\n484\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.055\nit probably means that we could have\nbeen able to condense that somewhat.\n\n485\n00:26:08.055 --> 00:26:10.485\nIn other words, I could have\nactually just left it off, but\n\n486\n00:26:10.485 --> 00:26:13.167\nat this point it just tells\nme to demonstrate that too.\n\n487\n00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:16.015\n&gt;&gt; Well, this it's also in the planning\nphase, we talked about it.\n\n488\n00:26:16.015 --> 00:26:17.365\nWe just want to list the stores.\n\n489\n00:26:17.365 --> 00:26:18.015\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n490\n00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:21.550\nand then the stores would have\nthe information about the store.\n\n491\n00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:26.780\nThe address, the city, the phone number\nand who is the manager of that store.\n\n492\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.210\nLike you just said,\nthe manager is also an employee.\n\n493\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.580\nBut the employees table,\n\n494\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.565\nit's going to be connected to other\nthings like who made what sales.\n\n495\n00:26:37.565 --> 00:26:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so, I was thinking ahead,\n\n496\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.410\nyou can already kind of maybe\nstart hearing yourself say, well,\n\n497\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:49.150\nI'd like to go ahead and track what were\nour sales by store or sales by employees.\n\n498\n00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.215\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because I want to be able to see who's\n\n499\n00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:52.510\nselling the most stuff.\n\n500\n00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.010\nAnd so that's where, in thinking about\nwhat you wanted as a result of your\n\n501\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.730\ninformation, how I do I have to build that\nand that's why we separated that out.\n\n502\n00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:02.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n503\n00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.020\nSo, Vonne, here it is,\nhere is our basic design.\n\n504\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.070\nNow before we move on to\nput this into Access,\n\n505\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.500\nI would recommend that you do this.\n\n506\n00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.400\nYou print it out, so\nyou don't have to actually see this, but\n\n507\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.960\nI essentially printed it out here.\n\n508\n00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.598\nAnd you're going to spend just a little\nbit of time going through this and\n\n509\n00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:21.810\nmarking it up.\n\n510\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.010\nSo in other words, walk through\nit just like what we did here and\n\n511\n00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.370\nmake sure that it validly works.\n\n512\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.580\nSo you heard Vonne kind of\nworking it out in her, you know,\n\n513\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.830\nas she was looking at it and\nseeing it, working out, do that.\n\n514\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.000\nJust go ahead and do that and\nmake sure that that's established.\n\n515\n00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.580\nAnd once you get that done,\nthen we can move in to Access and\n\n516\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.700\nbuild these relationships\nthe way that they need to.\n\n517\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we actually,\nthis was step one.\n\n518\n00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because right now,\n\n519\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.630\nit's like, we've built tables, no.\n\n520\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:55.150\nWe designed all of this before I even\nstarted doing this stuff in Excel and\n\n521\n00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.310\ndoing everything in Access.\n\n522\n00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.360\nNow, you might not always\nhave that luxury, but that\n\n523\n00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.580\nwas before we did anything in\nthe computer and with the data.\n\n524\n00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.942\nAnd even if you have data,\nthink about how you need to reorganize it.\n\n525\n00:28:10.942 --> 00:28:15.540\nAnd luckily I had you to help me\nto guide me through all of this.\n\n526\n00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.220\nSo it takes some practice.\n\n527\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but taking the time\nto kind of work through this,\n\n528\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.060\nI know it sounds tedious, but at the same\ntime this is where you're going to get\n\n529\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:28.410\nyour best understanding of the data, and\nwhat you want to see occur from this data.\n\n530\n00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.890\nSo, you are not wasting your time,\nyou are not just treading mud, and\n\n531\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.310\nnot moving anywhere,\nyou are actually developing the database.\n\n532\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.500\nAnd then once you get in Access,\neverything from that point works so\n\n533\n00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.190\nmuch better, and you actually\nstart seeing the power of Access\n\n534\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.480\nwhen you start entering in more data,\nand the more it can crunch for\n\n535\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.880\nyou, you don't have to worry\nabout it at that point.\n\n536\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.500\n&gt;&gt; This is a great explanation,\nso I'm assuming, is it safe for\n\n537\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.490\nme to assume that we're going\nto come back with a part two and\n\n538\n00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.620\nyou're going to show us how to\ndo this in Access with the,\n\n539\n00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.050\nit's the same thing, with the lines and\nall this stuff with the symbols but\n\n540\n00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.764\nnow we're just going ahead and\ndo it within Access.\n\n541\n00:29:06.764 --> 00:29:08.430\n&gt;&gt; We are going to do it within Access and\nthen we are going to see\n\n542\n00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:12.804\nall the details that we also have to be\ncareful of as we start to do this as well.\n\n543\n00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:17.610\nBut at that point we'll see some of the\nwarnings we have to pay attention to too.\n\n544\n00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.900\nSo make sure you stay tuned for\nthat episode.\n\n545\n00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.186\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm super excited,\nI don't know about you all, but I am.\n\n546\n00:29:23.186 --> 00:29:26.190\nWell, we're going to go ahead and\nwrap this episode up and\n\n547\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.160\nwe'll see you very soon.\n\n548\n00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.310\nSo signing off for our OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n549\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n550\n00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.153\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n551\n00:29:32.153 --> 00:29:32.653\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

exciting\nedition of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.912\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n5\n00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:21.475\nwe are continuing on with our\nAccess 2016 Essentials show.\n\n6\n00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:26.060\nAnd in this episode we're doing a part\ntwo of creating table relationships.\n\n7\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.707\nAnd here to help us, guide us through\nour relationship is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:31.258\nHello how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:32.554\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine Vonne.\n\n10\n00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:35.831\nThank you again for\nhaving me back here at Office Pro.\n\n11\n00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:39.482\nAs we continue on taking a look\nat creating table relationships.\n\n12\n00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:40.922\nIn a previous episode,\n\n13\n00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:45.324\nwe did show you some of the planning\nthat goes into table relationships.\n\n14\n00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:48.178\nAnd we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that really is kind of the meat\n\n15\n00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:49.690\nof the work that we have to do.\n\n16\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.600\nLet's take a look at my screen\nas we get started here.\n\n17\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.774\nThis is essentially the end result that\nwe had, at the end of a previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:01.109\nWhere we showed you how to create\nthese relationships on paper.\n\n19\n00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.164\nNow I recommend that you do this on paper,\nnot try to do this in your head.\n\n20\n00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:08.601\nThere are people that have done this for\nyears and years, Vonne.\n\n21\n00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.346\nAnd they can just make tables and\nthen at the end of it,\n\n22\n00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:15.206\nthey start creating these relationships\nand it works perfectly for them.\n\n23\n00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:18.436\nBut if you're a beginner,\nif you're starting out, and you go,\n\n24\n00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:21.254\nhey, I really wanna make this,\nmake it on paper first and\n\n25\n00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:23.337\nthen draw the lines like what we did here.\n\n26\n00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:27.181\nSo I'm showing you the process that I\nwould do if I were creating a brand new\n\n27\n00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:28.493\ndatabase from scratch.\n\n28\n00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:31.629\nAnd I think it helps you to logically\nsee the connection between those tables,\n\n29\n00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:32.921\nthat's what I'm telling you.\n\n30\n00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:36.831\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we discuss the one to one\nrelationship and the one to many and\n\n31\n00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.226\nthat's what we have our little\ninfinity signs and the ones.\n\n32\n00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:42.602\nAnd you are our relationship guru.\n\n33\n00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:43.213\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n34\n00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:46.044\n&gt;&gt; And getting us through all these\ndifferent types of relationships,\n\n35\n00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:47.132\nrelationships to avoid.\n\n36\n00:01:47.132 --> 00:01:49.968\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Many to many, not that they're wrong,\n\n37\n00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:51.560\nbut maybe not the best.\n\n38\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.994\nSo we kinda reviewed\nall those concepts and\n\n39\n00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:57.921\ntalked about the planning of all\nof our tables connecting together.\n\n40\n00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.285\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's very important,\nthat once we get this down and\n\n41\n00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:02.378\nwe go, this is good.\n\n42\n00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:04.419\nAnd we start working\nthrough it in our minds and\n\n43\n00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:06.367\nwe believe this is what's going to happen.\n\n44\n00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:11.368\nWell since we're also working with\nAccess 2016, it's important that we can\n\n45\n00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:16.380\nnow take the knowledge that we have here\nand make it apply inside of Access, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.259\nSo we take a look at just this\nkind if paper drawing, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.610\nThink about we have going on here, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.895\nFirst, we created every single table,\n\n49\n00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:27.741\nwe marked out the primary key that\nwe believe it's gonna be in here.\n\n50\n00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:32.234\nOnce we actually got all of those things\ninside of our database that we wanted,\n\n51\n00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:35.652\nwe also went ahead and\ncreated these table relationships.\n\n52\n00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:38.929\nAnd marked them in the type of\nrelationships we believe that they\n\n53\n00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.026\nare going to show up.\n\n54\n00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:44.850\nAnd this is important because without\nthat logic in mind you can add\n\n55\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.083\ntables in to Access and\nmake relationships between them.\n\n56\n00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:53.047\nBut it may not return to you the results\nthat you want them to return.\n\n57\n00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:57.937\nSo that is our next goal, essentially, is\ntransferring this logical diagram, okay,\n\n58\n00:02:57.937 --> 00:03:01.940\ninto something that functionally works for\nus which is Access.\n\n59\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.820\nSo that is what we\nare going to do right now.\n\n60\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.568\nSo as I switch over into Access, there's\na couple of different situations in\n\n61\n00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:14.473\nwhich you'll find yourself in access once\nyou have all of your tables created.\n\n62\n00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:16.215\nSo over on left hand side,\n\n63\n00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:21.608\nwe only really on the show created just a\ncouple of tables when we showed you this.\n\n64\n00:03:21.608 --> 00:03:24.771\nWell because what the rest of\nthe process is pretty much the same, so\n\n65\n00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.030\nI've created the other tables for us.\n\n66\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.595\nThere also something else down here\nthat you gonna see, that you gonna say,\n\n67\n00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:32.066\nI don't know what's that about Ronnie,\nyou're not even talking about it.\n\n68\n00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:35.508\nWe talked about this in the previous\nepisode where we said we had to\n\n69\n00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:38.573\nform a junction table,\nthat's a more advanced concept,\n\n70\n00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:40.467\nso I just created it to make it easy.\n\n71\n00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.349\nBecause we'll have some of this stuff\nin our show notes to make sure that\n\n72\n00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.755\neverything is gonna work for you.\n\n73\n00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:48.926\n&gt;&gt; That was that sales item, JT,\nwhich I thought was Justin Timberlake.\n\n74\n00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:51.815\n&gt;&gt; Justin Timberlake, that's right.\n&gt;&gt; But it's Junction table.\n\n75\n00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.585\n&gt;&gt; And they're not necessarily anything\nwe're gonna ever query to get results\n\n76\n00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.253\nfrom, But\nthey make that logical relationship work,\n\n77\n00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:02.148\nbecause remember that we showed you that\nthere was a many to many relationship.\n\n78\n00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:05.788\nAnd even though that's a real\nrelationship inside of databases,\n\n79\n00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:09.753\nas far as the logic goes, in relational\nmanagement system like Access,\n\n80\n00:04:09.753 --> 00:04:13.265\nwhich is what it is,\na relational database management system.\n\n81\n00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:16.451\nIt doesn't know how to deal\nwith many to manys in that way.\n\n82\n00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.602\nSo instead we have to create, we'll call\na junction table and make that work,\n\n83\n00:04:19.602 --> 00:04:21.143\nand that's what I did right here too.\n\n84\n00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:22.915\nSo we have all the tables and\n\n85\n00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:28.320\nthat's really what we're focusing in on\nis right here to make this at work, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.686\nNow, if you have a table open,\nlike what I have here open, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:37.686\nSo I have the employees' table opened\nup right here to create a relationship.\n\n88\n00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:40.800\nIt's kind of weird how it does\nthis in two different ways, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.874\nIs that what we'll do is if we have\nthe table and we select it on,\n\n90\n00:04:43.874 --> 00:04:46.439\nnotice that we'll have\nthe contextual tab up here.\n\n91\n00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.345\nAt the top is Table Tools then\nwe can select Table From there,\n\n92\n00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:55.874\nwe simply click on Relationships, and that\nwill bring up this relationship window.\n\n93\n00:04:55.874 --> 00:04:59.324\nIt's blank, because we now\nneed to add in stuff in there.\n\n94\n00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:01.392\nBut we can actually do it\nthat way if we need to.\n\n95\n00:05:01.392 --> 00:05:06.132\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of reminding me of the\nmaster slide in PowerPoint if anybody can\n\n96\n00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:07.193\nrelate to that.\n\n97\n00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:10.409\nIt's kind of like we're going back\nBehind the scenes in a sense, and\n\n98\n00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.237\nit's still part of the whole\nPowerPoint presentation, but\n\n99\n00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:16.076\nit's kinda controlling everything\nwithin all the slides.\n\n100\n00:05:16.076 --> 00:05:20.120\nAnd this is like we're going to the\nrelationships that's controlling how all\n\n101\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.183\nthe tables work, and\nit's kinda Kinda behind the scenes,\n\n102\n00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:25.621\nI just made that quick correlation.\n\n103\n00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:27.610\nI see this [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.636\n&gt;&gt; There's neat thing\nabout thing about this is,\n\n105\n00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:34.354\nwe´re actually manipulating\ntables in the background.\n\n106\n00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:37.395\nThose tables actually do exist\ninside the Access database.\n\n107\n00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:40.226\nBut they are not inter-related,\nthey are not connected yet.\n\n108\n00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:42.610\nAnd that's what we're gonna\ndo in this particular window.\n\n109\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.852\nNow I wanted to show you this one because\nthis is the one that kinda trips us up,\n\n110\n00:05:46.852 --> 00:05:50.982\nbecause it is located in two different\nplaces depending on where your ent.\n\n111\n00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:55.476\nSo normally we're working the tables cuz\nthis we're start doing data entry Dummy\n\n112\n00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:56.322\ndata entries so\n\n113\n00:05:56.322 --> 00:06:00.897\nthat we can test out our relationships as\nwell as everything else that goes on here.\n\n114\n00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:04.383\nSo we can start entering in data to\nall of our tables, and Vaughn has\n\n115\n00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:08.384\ngraciously did this for us inside of\nExcel so that we could just import it in.\n\n116\n00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:12.821\nAnd we got a lot of data ahead of us,\nthat we get to work with.\n\n117\n00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:15.199\nBut what if I don't have anything open?\n\n118\n00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.465\nSo I'm gonna close out of this table Well,\nnow all the sudden,\n\n119\n00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:23.423\nnotice that the contextual\ntab doesn't appear anymore.\n\n120\n00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:26.943\nWell I'm working from this point of view,\nwhat I need to do,\n\n121\n00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:30.187\nis I need to click on,\ndatabase tools, and then under,\n\n122\n00:06:30.187 --> 00:06:34.697\ndatabase tools, notice that there's\na grouping called, relationships.\n\n123\n00:06:34.697 --> 00:06:38.386\nThen of course, we have that tool\nright there for relationships.\n\n124\n00:06:38.386 --> 00:06:42.761\nDefine how data and\ntables is related such as ID fields or\n\n125\n00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:46.871\nname fields in different\ntables that should match.\n\n126\n00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:48.496\n&gt;&gt; May be this is a silly question but\n\n127\n00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:51.521\nshould you always have the tables\nclosed or doesn't matter?\n\n128\n00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:54.078\nCan you have an open or\nclosed cuz I know sometimes you have to\n\n129\n00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:56.546\neverything closed before you\nto this particular point.\n\n130\n00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:57.656\nIt doesn't matter in this sense?\n\n131\n00:06:57.656 --> 00:07:02.736\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't matter in this sense\nof us creating the actual relationships,\n\n132\n00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:03.996\nBut it does matter.\n\n133\n00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:05.174\nI know, it is kinda weird, yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I say that all the time,\nthe same but different.\n\n135\n00:07:06.912 --> 00:07:11.071\n&gt;&gt; It's the phrase that a college\nprofessor taught me when\n\n136\n00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:13.734\nI was back in college way back when.\n\n137\n00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:17.208\nIs he said it always works\nuntil it doesn't, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:20.618\n&gt;&gt; So that's a phrase that I've\nalways kinda learned how to adopt,\n\n139\n00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:22.668\nespecially with these applications.\n\n140\n00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:26.978\n&gt;&gt; Yes, closing them out is probably\nyour best bet in getting all those\n\n141\n00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:31.362\nrelationships to work the way that\nyou want to, but at the same time,\n\n142\n00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:34.106\nleaving them open, you can still do that.\n\n143\n00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:38.458\nBut what you might find out, though, is\nthat when you leave them open and then you\n\n144\n00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.628\ngo I need to make a change here Is not\ngonna save your changes very easily.\n\n145\n00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.692\nSo in other words, you can leave them\nopen and still make those relationships.\n\n146\n00:07:45.692 --> 00:07:48.664\nBut then if you realize,\nyou have to change something in the table,\n\n147\n00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:50.452\nit might kinda wig out just a little bit.\n\n148\n00:07:50.452 --> 00:07:54.306\n&gt;&gt; So just be good to say,\nas a good rule of thumb, go ahead and\n\n149\n00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:58.263\nestablish your relationships\nwith your table's closed.\n\n150\n00:07:58.263 --> 00:08:01.959\n&gt;&gt; Right Just because [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you'll see that as\n\n151\n00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:05.460\nyou go along, but everyone works\na little bit differently, so.\n\n152\n00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.950\nAccess gives you options, but\n\n153\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.180\nit won't ever let you do something where\nyou're going to end up deleting data.\n\n154\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.090\nBecause the whole goal of\ndatabase of course is so\n\n155\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.530\nthat you'll never lose any data that\nyou have that already existing.\n\n156\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.830\nNow if you're gonna come to do\nsomething that you will lose data,\n\n157\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.410\nit will plainly tell you,\nyou're about to lose some data here,\n\n158\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.620\nyou're about to delete these records and\nonce you do it it's permanently gone.\n\n159\n00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.260\nThat's the phrase that should scare you.\n\n160\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.500\nIn other words, you won't recover\nfrom this even if you saved it.\n\n161\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.200\nSo that's why I recommend that, before you\ndo this, and this is step number two here.\n\n162\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.110\nIs, before you do this, make sure you\nhave a backup of your database up and\n\n163\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.560\nto this point, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.800\nI always like doing that, because then\nI know I have a copy of my data as it\n\n165\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.360\nexists, in the state that it exists in.\n\n166\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.140\nAnd, that way,\nI'm essentially practicing here.\n\n167\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.040\nAnd once everything is actually up and\ngoing and I get everything\n\n168\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.550\nworking the way that I want to then I can\nactually just rename this one that I did\n\n169\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.660\nall the practice on and still have the\nbackup and delete the backup if I want to.\n\n170\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.688\nBut that way I'm never at this loss where\nit says data's about to be permanently\n\n171\n00:09:11.688 --> 00:09:16.235\ndeleted, and I accidentally go I\ndidn't mean to click yes [LAUGH].\n\n172\n00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:18.637\n&gt;&gt; It's like you don't wanna\nget too far up the creek.\n\n173\n00:09:18.637 --> 00:09:19.395\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:20.445\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you have\n\n175\n00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:23.295\na couple boats in backup with your creek.\n\n176\n00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:24.750\nAnd some paddles.\n\n177\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n178\n00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:29.855\nit really does help especially if the data\nis really something that you value, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:33.905\nIf you're just working with dummy data, in\nother words if you're just building just\n\n180\n00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:37.490\nto test out can you do it or not, and\nyou're entering a dummy information that\n\n181\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.350\ndoesn't matter at all to your business or\nto you, then go for it.\n\n182\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.320\nYou know, what's the big harm?\n\n183\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.430\nAll you have to do is create it again.\n\n184\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.210\nBut overall though, especially if you're\ndealing with other people's data and\n\n185\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.400\nthey've handed it to you,\nyou need to treat it as if it's actually\n\n186\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.710\ntheir data and something that you're\nactually being allowed to use, so\n\n187\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.740\ntake very good care of it, right?\n\n188\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.110\nSo I'm simply gonna launch up the\nrelationship window by clicking on that\n\n189\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.628\nand you now notice it's pretty much\nthe same thing that we see here.\n\n190\n00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:06.020\nI'm gonna collapse this down so\n\n191\n00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.420\nwe have a little bit more real\nestate to work with, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.180\nNow at this point, okay big deal,\n\n193\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.620\nit looks like a grey background Vonne,\nand the key question is simple.\n\n194\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.560\nWell, what do we do next?\n\n195\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.010\nWell, the key thing here then is to\ngo ahead and select Show Tables.\n\n196\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:30.280\nOnce I do that, it will bring me of course\nto this nice little dialogue box and\n\n197\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.300\nI will actually have access\nto a couple of things here.\n\n198\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.990\nIn this particular way that\nwe can do relationships,\n\n199\n00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.260\nwe're only gonna be working with tables.\n\n200\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.860\nAs you become more advanced what you\ncan do is you can create queries and\n\n201\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.480\ncreate a relationship between tables and\nqueries if you want to.\n\n202\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.290\nNow the reason you might go\nwhy the heck would I do that?\n\n203\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.970\nWell that's gonna become more\nclear in the advance show.\n\n204\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.270\nBut there are times where what you\nreally do need is that particular\n\n205\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.560\nset of information.\n\n206\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.710\nThen you want to actually make\na query based off of that information.\n\n207\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:07.160\nVersus another piece of data\ninside of the tables here, but\n\n208\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.640\nyou're not actually\nseeing it in one place.\n\n209\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.460\nSo it's actually a need\nthat we can do this.\n\n210\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.010\n&gt;&gt; This is getting into like\nanother level of thinking.\n\n211\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Another level, yes.\n\n212\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.950\n&gt;&gt; Of like we say,\ngrabbing that information from may\n\n213\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.550\nbe multiple tables into one,\nrecord sets in a query, right?\n\n214\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just making sure, and\n\n215\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.760\nthen doing more off of that,\nall right, sounds fun.\n\n216\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but we're just gonna stick\nwith tables right now as we go into\n\n217\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.870\nthe advanced stuff we'll get more\ninto something like this, right.\n\n218\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.960\nSo what do I wanna do?\n\n219\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.280\nI wanna go ahead and add in some tables.\n\n220\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.500\nNow you can add in all of your tables if\nyou want to if you know that you're going\n\n221\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.270\nto be creating relationships between them,\nso let me go ahead and do that.\n\n222\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.680\nIf I wanna add in all of them I just\nsimply select the first one such as\n\n223\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.260\ncustomer pets, I hold my shift key down\nand I select not all of them, okay.\n\n224\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.690\nSo if I wanted to add them all in all\nat the same time, you can do that.\n\n225\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.580\nBut depending on how many tables you have\nand the resolution that you have on your\n\n226\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.080\nscreen, this can make things\nlook really junky very quickly.\n\n227\n00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.610\nSo just kind of be careful.\n\n228\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.070\nLet me show you what I'm\ntalking about right here.\n\n229\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.550\nSo I'm gonna click on add, and when I do\nthat notice it added in all these tables.\n\n230\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.140\nNow I've already got some links in here\nand that's because of the junction table.\n\n231\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.350\nI've left that in there on purpose so\nyou're not trying to figure that one out.\n\n232\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.080\nBut that way it'd still be in the file.\n\n233\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.260\n&gt;&gt; And it looks almost like\nthe things you drew in OneNote.\n\n234\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.110\n&gt;&gt; Just about.\n\n235\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.946\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like you wanted to\ncorrelate what you're actually\n\n236\n00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:33.940\ngonna see in Access.\n\n237\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit just depends on the way that you have.\n\n238\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.640\nBut you notice how it lists out.\n\n239\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.280\nNow you do have to be careful when\nyou have the Show Table open.\n\n240\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.310\nSo if I'm not careful,\nI can just double-click on this thing.\n\n241\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.740\nAnd double click on it, and\n\n242\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.540\nnow you'll notice that it actually\nallows you to do duplicates.\n\n243\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.700\nSo you see right here where you\nhave customers one customer two.\n\n244\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.370\nWell if I don't want that\nI simply right click, and\n\n245\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.710\nI hide that table, I right click on\nthis one, and I hide the table here too.\n\n246\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.420\n&gt;&gt; That can get a little wonky if\nyou have duplicates and everything.\n\n247\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.830\nAnd notice it didn't say delete,\nbecause you're just hiding it from this\n\n248\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.690\nparticular view of where you're\nestablishing those relationships.\n\n249\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.710\nSo, nothing's deleted.\n\n250\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.780\nEverything's good.\n\n251\n00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\nThat's actually gonna be something more\n\n252\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.530\nuseful towards the advanced stuff\nwhere we do what we call a self join.\n\n253\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.190\nBut at this point we're just trying\nto do queries is what we're gonna do.\n\n254\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.070\nSo now you wanna move them in\nthe logical order that you created.\n\n255\n00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.600\nThat great thing is if you've\nalready created that diagram,\n\n256\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.280\nit helps you because this is the way\nthat you're mind is gonna flow out and\n\n257\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.120\nthat's what you want to be able follow and\ndo.\n\n258\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.510\nSo I'm gonna rearrange the tables\njust a little bit to help us out.\n\n259\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.410\nSo let's go back to my screen.\n\n260\n00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.160\nAnd that way I can begin doing this.\n\n261\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.320\nSo, I'm simply going to move the stuff\nin kind of the way that I see it on my\n\n262\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.060\npaper over here.\n\n263\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.540\nAt least I think I am.\n\n264\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.210\nI could be wrong.\n\n265\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.300\nI want sales over here.\n\n266\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.810\nI want this junction table in\nbetween products and sales here.\n\n267\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.170\nAnd then I'll have the stores sort of over\nhere and the employee's right about here.\n\n268\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.650\nSo that's kind of the idea,\nat least very close.\n\n269\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.840\nNow, each of these fields\ndon't have to seen.\n\n270\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.920\nYou'll notice this little scroll\nbars over here on the side.\n\n271\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.850\nThat means they're collapsed down.\n\n272\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:21.550\nIf you need to see them,\n\n273\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.680\nnote that you can use the resizing\nhandles to allow you to see everything.\n\n274\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.400\nBut to make them fit on the screen right\nnow, I'm just gonna leave them collapsed\n\n275\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.560\nand then I'll actually\nscroll down when I need to,\n\n276\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.070\nto get access to them as we're\ncreating our relationships.\n\n277\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.880\nNow that I have the tables here,\nin Access ready for\n\n278\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.580\nthis relationship window,\nwe need to go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:49.000\nbegin to create this relationship\nbetween these tables okay.\n\n280\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.520\nSo the first thing that I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna work between the customer and\n\n281\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.990\nthe sales table.\n\n282\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.120\nAnd I'm simply gonna match up what I have\nin my diagram, which I said, the primary\n\n283\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.450\nkey in the customer's table is going\nto essentially connect to the customer\n\n284\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:08.740\nID over here in the sales table, which\nis my foreign key in the sales table.\n\n285\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.890\nWhen I do that,\nnotice it will bring up this window.\n\n286\n00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.700\n&gt;&gt; And just to clarify what you\nwere doing was clicking and\n\n287\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.490\nholding on-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n288\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.800\n&gt;&gt; The primary key in the customers table.\n\n289\n00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.460\n&gt;&gt; And dragging it over cuz I was\n\n290\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.200\nnoticing your mouse cursor's changed-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n291\n00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Where click hold drag, drag over\ninto the table that you want to connect.\n\n292\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.970\nIt did like a little plus sign.\n\n293\n00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The white arrows,\n\n294\n00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.680\nsomething like that, and\nthen you let go of the mouse.\n\n295\n00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And once you let go of the mouse,\n\n296\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.950\nthis little-\n&gt;&gt; Window.\n\n297\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Dialog box came up.\n\n298\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.430\nOkay, just making sure.\n\n299\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\nI just do click, drag, and\n\n300\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.500\nthen I let go is what I end up doing here.\n\n301\n00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.200\nNow you do have to be\ncareful here in this window.\n\n302\n00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.984\nYou wanna verify that this is exactly\nwhat you want to see as the connection.\n\n303\n00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:55.068\nTake a look at the tables up here\nin the grey, that's greyed out,\n\n304\n00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:57.760\ntake a look at the fields\ndown here as well.\n\n305\n00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.329\nAre those the fields that you\nthink are going to match?\n\n306\n00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:06.522\nOnce you have that, you do want to make\nsure that you'll actually see whether or\n\n307\n00:16:06.522 --> 00:16:10.570\nnot you can check this one,\nEnforce referential integrity.\n\n308\n00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.250\nNow we haven't talked about this\nidea of referential integrity yet.\n\n309\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.501\nBut when we start creating those\nrelationships between all those tables,\n\n310\n00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:23.483\nwhat it wants to ensure between those\nrelationships of those tables is\n\n311\n00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.307\nthis, okay.\n\n312\n00:16:24.307 --> 00:16:29.766\nIf you update, okay,\na particular record in one table,\n\n313\n00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:34.542\nokay, we also have to make\nsure that the same field\n\n314\n00:16:34.542 --> 00:16:39.300\nis updated in the other table as well,\nokay.\n\n315\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.780\nAnd the reason for that is it's sort of\nlike this idea what we call orphaning, or\n\n316\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.780\nwidowing lines, and stuff.\n\n317\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.470\nBut what is this actually saying\nif you go to Word, right?\n\n318\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.710\nWhat this is saying is\nreferential integrity says this.\n\n319\n00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:56.720\nIf I make an update in one table and\nthis field is updated, then I'd\n\n320\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.950\nbetter make sure that there's a matching\none over in the other table, okay.\n\n321\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.000\nBecause if I only update one and I don't\nupdate the other, that means that there is\n\n322\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.860\na possibility that a record does exist\nright there that I cannot query for or\n\n323\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.740\nI cannot find.\n\n324\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.780\nThe same thing too.\n\n325\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.360\nIf I delete a record in one table,\n\n326\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.700\nthen I also have to delete the record\nin the other table as well.\n\n327\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.910\nBecause if I delete one in one table,\n\n328\n00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.770\nsuch as the customer's table, but\nI forget to delete the sales over here,\n\n329\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.530\nwell now I have a sales that doesn't\nmatch a single customer, okay.\n\n330\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.120\nSo we want to make sure that we at least\nmatched it up in referential integrity\n\n331\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.830\nsays enforce this idea.\n\n332\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.281\n&gt;&gt; So in this particular example,\nwe have the customers, and\n\n333\n00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:47.082\nthat's our loyalty program.\n\n334\n00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:47.663\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n335\n00:17:47.663 --> 00:17:49.184\n&gt;&gt; And then we have sales.\n\n336\n00:17:49.184 --> 00:17:55.120\nBut we could have a sale without\na customer loyalty number.\n\n337\n00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.530\nSo in this sense, we wouldn't want,\nwell, I don't know,\n\n338\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.630\ncuz we don't wanna delete the sale.\n\n339\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.210\nCuz let's say the person just doesn't\nwanna be part of the loyalty program,\n\n340\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:08.000\nbut their sale is still a sale, so\nwe wouldn't, in this particular example,\n\n341\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.300\nthe way I have it in my head.\n\n342\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.960\n&gt;&gt; If we're dealing it,\nif we're doing it on customer loyalty.\n\n343\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.560\nBut the great thing is here,\nI chose customer ID.\n\n344\n00:18:15.588 --> 00:18:16.314\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n345\n00:18:16.314 --> 00:18:19.758\neven though somebody might be\ncoming in to pay cash, and\n\n346\n00:18:19.758 --> 00:18:23.884\nnow she had to adjust something in\nour tables to help us to see this.\n\n347\n00:18:23.884 --> 00:18:27.419\nEven though somebody might be\ncoming in to pay cash, well, I do\n\n348\n00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:32.040\nneed them actually registered somehow that\nthey came in and they paid cash for it.\n\n349\n00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.900\nEven though they don't have any\nreal particular individual loyalty\n\n350\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.620\nID, that's what I was trying to say,\nyou'll still be able to do that.\n\n351\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.870\nSo on this one though, I do need that,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n352\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.790\nselect enforce referential integrity.\n\n353\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.250\nNow, what happens if I don't?\n\n354\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.120\nLet's go ahead and click Create.\n\n355\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.910\nLet me show you what the result is.\n\n356\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.470\nNotice the result is different here.\n\n357\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.340\nIt doesn't establish whether this\nis a one to one, or a one to many,\n\n358\n00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.740\nor a many to many relationship.\n\n359\n00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.330\nYou'll notice that it just kind of\ngives us a line that says these tables\n\n360\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.550\nare linked on these fields, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.770\nSo it's not gonna try and\n\n362\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.840\nenforce that type of relationship\nif it doesn't need to, okay?\n\n363\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.299\nBut we want it to because of the way that\nwe have it set up, so if I select this.\n\n364\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.190\nNow, Von brought up a very\ngood instance though.\n\n365\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.188\nWhat about the customer loyalty, and\n\n366\n00:19:23.188 --> 00:19:26.756\nnotice how it changes were added\nin the actual symbols here, okay.\n\n367\n00:19:26.756 --> 00:19:31.513\nThere is a possibility that I do\nhave customers that are not part of\n\n368\n00:19:31.513 --> 00:19:35.905\nthat loyalty ID program,\nokay, that we have.\n\n369\n00:19:35.905 --> 00:19:40.785\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, it just kind of clicked\nto my head, it was that second\n\n370\n00:19:40.785 --> 00:19:45.195\none that I was connecting to the pets and\nif that's, it's separate.\n\n371\n00:19:45.195 --> 00:19:45.909\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n372\n00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:49.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n&gt;&gt; So now watch this, if I select loyalty\n\n373\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:55.210\nID and I click and I drag that down\nhere to loyalty ID, there it goes.\n\n374\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.950\nSo it says hey, you've done this,\nnotice it's a one to many relationship.\n\n375\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.160\nNeither one actually is the primary key.\n\n376\n00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.240\nThey're both essentially foreign\nkeys in these two tables.\n\n377\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.510\nBut look at what happens if I try this,\nif I enforce referential integrity and\n\n378\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.090\nI click Create, okay,\nnow it's gonna give me an error.\n\n379\n00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.350\nNow the error is actually relatively\nsimple here, okay, it's essentially saying\n\n380\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:25.412\nlook, not everybody in the customers\ntable has a loyalty ID number, okay.\n\n381\n00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:28.260\nSo there's no way I can\nenforce referential integrity\n\n382\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.230\nif not everybody in the customers\ntable has a loyalty ID number.\n\n383\n00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.080\nI could have customers that\ncome in that say, Ronnie,\n\n384\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.930\nI don't like your product that\nmuch that I don't wanna be part of\n\n385\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.120\nthe loyalty program, but\nI do need to buy this right now, okay.\n\n386\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.238\nSo it is possible, so you may see that.\n\n387\n00:20:44.238 --> 00:20:48.078\nSo you wanna make sure that you read this\nhere and this is where you can see what\n\n388\n00:20:48.078 --> 00:20:51.390\nI'm talking about,\nwhich is the second line right here.\n\n389\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.515\nFor example, there may be records relating\nto the employee in the related table, but\n\n390\n00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:59.890\nno record for\nthe employee in the primary table, okay.\n\n391\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.290\nSo this is saying you have a record over\nhere in the pets table for the loyalty ID,\n\n392\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:09.260\nbut I can't find a match for all of\nthem up here in the Customers table.\n\n393\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.590\nSo that way I can't enforce that type\nof referential integrity at all.\n\n394\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.860\nSo, will it still work?\n\n395\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.810\nYou better believe it.\n\n396\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.440\nI can go ahead and click Create here.\n\n397\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.030\nOops, I have to go and uncheck that or\nit's gonna give me the same error.\n\n398\n00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.560\nLet me go and uncheck that and\nclick Create, and\n\n399\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.610\nnow I say you got the link there and\nthat will work perfectly fine.\n\n400\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.180\n&gt;&gt; It's the primary key,\nthat's the kicker.\n\n401\n00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.638\nThat when I was like uh-oh,\n\n402\n00:21:30.638 --> 00:21:35.400\nokay, I got it because if a primary key,\nthat's the unique identifier,\n\n403\n00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.160\nyou definitely, if that goes away,\nyou'd want that to go away in the sales.\n\n404\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.100\nThe whole record of the sales\nthat would not delete.\n\n405\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; It's just that particular field.\n\n406\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep.\n\n407\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, okay, got it.\n\n408\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.720\n&gt;&gt; So now here's this junction table in\nthe middle and this is where it becomes\n\n409\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.040\na little bit more, like I said,\nthis is more of the advanced stuff.\n\n410\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.120\nWe're not gonna go over too much here.\n\n411\n00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.600\nBut I simply took the SalesID column and\nI imported it into this one here.\n\n412\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.300\nAnd I took the item number from the\nProducts column and I imported it here and\n\n413\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.800\nthe way I did that is I used\na query between those two tables.\n\n414\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.870\nThe sales and\nthe product table formed a query and\n\n415\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.940\nthen I told it to make a table out of it.\n\n416\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.560\nAnd that created my junction table, okay?\n\n417\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.540\nWhen I did so,\nI turned them both into a primary key, so\n\n418\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.250\nthat the combination of both\nare gonna be unique numbers.\n\n419\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.482\nSo it's not the single field,\nbut it's the combination.\n\n420\n00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:35.880\nSo SalesID can actually appear a couple\nof different times with different\n\n421\n00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.160\nitem numbers as you continue to go\nthrough there, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n422\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.620\nMultiple item numbers can appear with\ndifferent SalesIDs and that's fine.\n\n423\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.650\nAnd that's why you have over here, SalesID\nonly gonna appear once in this, but\n\n424\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.860\nmany times over here, and\nthe very fact is the same thing.\n\n425\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.190\nNumber ID over here and the products table\nonly appear one time on this table, but\n\n426\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:59.190\nit can appear multiple times, that this\nway sales can be linked to products.\n\n427\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.170\nSo I can have multiple sales\nwith multiple products, okay?\n\n428\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.080\nSo we're gonna see that\nagain in the more advance,\n\n429\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.800\nbut we needed that to make\nthat work in our situation.\n\n430\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.630\nNow from this point,\nI also want to connect the product ID or\n\n431\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:19.670\nthe product excuse me,\nto the actual store.\n\n432\n00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:25.245\nNow here I'm gonna select under products,\nI'm gonna select StoreNumber and\n\n433\n00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:28.392\nthen connect that to\nStore table over here.\n\n434\n00:23:28.392 --> 00:23:33.200\nSo some people always do this like,\nalways start with a primary key and\n\n435\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.640\nthen pull over to your\nforeign key relationship.\n\n436\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.390\nTo me it doesn't matter one way or\nanother, but\n\n437\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.150\nthat's the way they always start it.\n\n438\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.818\nAnd I'm gonna select Enforce\nreferential integrity and click Create.\n\n439\n00:23:44.818 --> 00:23:47.968\nAnd notice again,\nif referential integrity is enforced,\n\n440\n00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:52.198\nwe'll get the numbers and you'll get\nthe little infinity symbol here, okay.\n\n441\n00:23:52.198 --> 00:23:57.326\nThat last one that I'm also going to\ndo is down here on the Employees.\n\n442\n00:23:57.326 --> 00:24:00.452\nI wanna find out what\nemployees are actually in the,\n\n443\n00:24:00.452 --> 00:24:04.943\nactually I hooked it up to the,\nmake sure I'm seeing it, manager, okay.\n\n444\n00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:08.485\nSo I wanna find out what\nthe manager is of each store, so\n\n445\n00:24:08.485 --> 00:24:12.490\nI selected EmployeeID because\nit's gonna be the same thing.\n\n446\n00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.810\nThe ManagerID and\nthe EmployeeID are gonna be the same, and\n\n447\n00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.750\nwe'll pull it over here, and enforce the\nreferential integrity, and click Create.\n\n448\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.576\nNow, the only other thing that I did,\nbecause I wanna find out the sales, and\n\n449\n00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:32.184\nwho's actually involved in sales, is I'm\nalso gonna select the EmployeeID and\n\n450\n00:24:32.184 --> 00:24:35.812\nlink that directly to\nthe sales table over here, and\n\n451\n00:24:35.812 --> 00:24:39.796\nenforce the referential integrity,\nand click Create.\n\n452\n00:24:39.796 --> 00:24:42.601\nSo this is a little bit more\njam packed than my drawing, and\n\n453\n00:24:42.601 --> 00:24:46.540\nI can't, I don't think I can actually,\nlet me zoom out, there we go.\n\n454\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.972\nSo here's how it actually looks, and\n\n455\n00:24:48.972 --> 00:24:52.018\nthat pretty much is the same\nas what we saw here.\n\n456\n00:24:52.018 --> 00:24:56.942\nSo now that everything is actually done\nin that particular relationship here,\n\n457\n00:24:56.942 --> 00:25:01.791\nthis is what you want to actually be able\nto do at this point, is you wanna verify\n\n458\n00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:06.638\nthat everything is actually logically\nthe way that you had it on the sheet, and\n\n459\n00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:11.550\nthat if everything is good at that point,\nand that you're ready.\n\n460\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.776\nYou can do one of two things.\n\n461\n00:25:13.776 --> 00:25:18.148\nIf you just created those tables, Vonne,\nif we just created tables, and we didn't\n\n462\n00:25:18.148 --> 00:25:22.275\nhave any sample data, we would need to\nstart populating each of those different\n\n463\n00:25:22.275 --> 00:25:26.425\ntables, that we had, with the sample data,\nand that way, we're ready to go.\n\n464\n00:25:26.425 --> 00:25:28.620\nNow what if you realize you have\nto change something, Vonne?\n\n465\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.133\nWhat if I needed to change something?\n\n466\n00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:34.390\nWell if I right-click on that table,\non that line,\n\n467\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.820\nnotice I can delete the relationship or\nI can even edit the relationship, here.\n\n468\n00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.890\nI'm just gonna simply select Delete\nright now, and notice what it ask me.\n\n469\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.815\nAre you sure you want to permanently\ndelete this relationship?\n\n470\n00:25:46.815 --> 00:25:50.129\nIf you really have data in there and\nyou have queries going on,\n\n471\n00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:51.286\nthis can affect you.\n\n472\n00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:53.853\nSo you want to be careful about doing\nsomething like this, but at the beginning,\n\n473\n00:25:53.853 --> 00:25:55.082\nif I don't, it's not gonna matter.\n\n474\n00:25:55.082 --> 00:26:00.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we're not querying anything\nright now, we're still on the set up,\n\n475\n00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:05.124\nbut even if we have data in each one\nof those tables right now, it's okay to\n\n476\n00:26:05.124 --> 00:26:09.930\nsever the relationship, because we\nhaven't done anything past that.\n\n477\n00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.468\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n478\n00:26:10.468 --> 00:26:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's only if you have queries,\nreports, or anything else going on, forms.\n\n479\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and, Vonne,\nthis makes sense to us,\n\n480\n00:26:16.852 --> 00:26:20.541\nbecause if we've already built those\nthings up, queries, and forms, and\n\n481\n00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:24.748\nreports based off of these relationships,\nand I remove that relationship it's gonna\n\n482\n00:26:24.748 --> 00:26:28.696\ngo and say all right I need to use this,\nit's not there, so it's gonna break.\n\n483\n00:26:28.696 --> 00:26:30.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's kind of like cutting it off\n\n484\n00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.592\nat the source level, not all these kind of\nexternal, cuz all those forms, queries and\n\n485\n00:26:35.592 --> 00:26:39.731\nreports are all connected or coming\nfrom your tables, and your data, and\n\n486\n00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:43.303\nyour relationships, so\nthat's where it gets a little weird.\n\n487\n00:26:43.303 --> 00:26:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but this is what brings us,\nat least, to a good point again.\n\n488\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:53.186\nHaving good documentation on hand\nfiled away, whether it's electronic or\n\n489\n00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:57.297\nwhether it's on paper,\nit is going to save you in the future.\n\n490\n00:26:57.297 --> 00:27:01.273\nIf you allow other people to work\nwith your Axis database, people will,\n\n491\n00:27:01.273 --> 00:27:04.875\nafter a while, they'll get curious like,\nhow is this working?\n\n492\n00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:07.340\nThey'll go to the relationships table,\nand what will they do?\n\n493\n00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.845\nLet's take a look at my screen.\n\n494\n00:27:08.845 --> 00:27:10.110\nThey'll go, I wonder what this is about.\n\n495\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.407\nI wonder if I delete this or\nedit this relationship.\n\n496\n00:27:13.407 --> 00:27:15.780\nWell, is that actually\ngonna change anything?\n\n497\n00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.049\nWell, it depends on what they do.\n\n498\n00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:20.822\nSo like this Join Type button,\nwhich we'll hit in the.\n\n499\n00:27:20.822 --> 00:27:23.284\nYes, that will change\nthe results of what you do,\n\n500\n00:27:23.284 --> 00:27:25.370\nso that's why we're not\ndoing it right now.\n\n501\n00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:28.420\nBut what we're actually gonna,\nso somebody can come in and\n\n502\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.320\njust change something just that simple.\n\n503\n00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.330\nSo you wanna make sure that you have good\ndocumentation of your database as well,\n\n504\n00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.730\nand just starting something either\na piece of paper in a file somewhere, or\n\n505\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.870\nelectronically stored somewhere,\nis gonna help good backups are gonna help.\n\n506\n00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.486\nBut once we got the relationship ready\nto go, and we think that this is right,\n\n507\n00:27:47.486 --> 00:27:50.698\nyou can always run this\nrelationship report as well.\n\n508\n00:27:50.698 --> 00:27:54.024\nIf I select, well let me see,\nif I select that, there we go, and\n\n509\n00:27:54.024 --> 00:27:56.567\nthis is what you can print\nout to help you out.\n\n510\n00:27:56.567 --> 00:27:58.356\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like what we-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we just did, yeah.\n\n511\n00:27:58.356 --> 00:27:59.794\n&gt;&gt; Built in OneNode, we could, okay.\n\n512\n00:27:59.794 --> 00:28:01.786\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's nice, it really is.\n\n513\n00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:03.670\nIt's kind of standardized.\n\n514\n00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.960\nIt allows you to be able to see that.\n\n515\n00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.508\nThen you can write your own notes\nin-between, like if you changed anything,\n\n516\n00:28:08.508 --> 00:28:11.733\nor if you have some detail about why\nit's actually related that way, so\n\n517\n00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:12.452\nit can do that.\n\n518\n00:28:12.452 --> 00:28:16.847\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I actually just read the tab that\nwas up there on the ribbon that says,\n\n519\n00:28:16.847 --> 00:28:17.870\nprint preview.\n\n520\n00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.503\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So it says stuff like, page size and,\n\n521\n00:28:20.503 --> 00:28:25.511\nlook, it looks like you can export it out\nor something over there on the data group.\n\n522\n00:28:25.511 --> 00:28:26.090\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yep.\n\n523\n00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.649\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n524\n00:28:26.649 --> 00:28:27.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n525\n00:28:27.242 --> 00:28:31.780\nit really does give you all those\noptions that will help you out here too.\n\n526\n00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.640\nNow I just hit the Design view and\nthe Report.\n\n527\n00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.240\nSo I'm gonna close that out,\ncuz we don't need to see that yet.\n\n528\n00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.220\nI'm not gonna save any changes and\nit will bring us right back here.\n\n529\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.290\nNow Vonne, we've gotten the relationships\nnow, at least what we think is good.\n\n530\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.550\nWhat you're gonna find out, especially if\nthis is your first or second time though,\n\n531\n00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.330\nVonn, in doing this, even though you\nplanned it out and you talked it all out,\n\n532\n00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.400\nthere is a slight chance,\nthat when you go to test this, and\n\n533\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.420\nthe way that we test these relationships\nout is we run select queries.\n\n534\n00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.595\nWhen you go to test this you might find\nout it's not giving you the result you\n\n535\n00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:08.397\ndon't want.\n\n536\n00:29:08.397 --> 00:29:11.876\nThat's why you use Snapple or\nDummy Data at the beginning to do this.\n\n537\n00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:14.678\nDon't put your real production\ndata into it and go, I don't care.\n\n538\n00:29:14.678 --> 00:29:17.369\nI'm just gonna do this, cuz you\nmight find out it's not gonna work.\n\n539\n00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:20.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think you just kind of drove\n\n540\n00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.676\nthe point home to me.\n\n541\n00:29:22.676 --> 00:29:25.809\nYou build all of your field,\nyour tables, your relationship.\n\n542\n00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:30.593\nMaybe put two, three,\nfour lines of information.\n\n543\n00:29:30.593 --> 00:29:31.457\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Or, records, sorry.\n\n544\n00:29:31.457 --> 00:29:32.066\n&gt;&gt; Records.\n\n545\n00:29:32.066 --> 00:29:37.935\n&gt;&gt; Four records in each one, and then run\nvery simple parts, because you might have\n\n546\n00:29:37.935 --> 00:29:43.372\nhundreds of thousands of records that\nyou're going to go ahead and put in,\n\n547\n00:29:43.372 --> 00:29:46.713\nbut you wanna make sure it works on four-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n548\n00:29:46.713 --> 00:29:48.010\n&gt;&gt; Rather than 400,000.\n\n549\n00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.798\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz then you're gonna really,\n\n550\n00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:51.001\nwe're gonna be up a creek.\n\n551\n00:29:51.001 --> 00:29:51.604\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n552\n00:29:51.604 --> 00:29:52.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n553\n00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:54.135\n&gt;&gt; But it really is,\nit's important that we do that.\n\n554\n00:29:54.135 --> 00:29:55.415\nSo once everything is done and\n\n555\n00:29:55.415 --> 00:29:58.725\nwe don't have sample data, we've gotta\npopulate some sample data into it.\n\n556\n00:29:58.725 --> 00:30:01.015\nBut then we can run those queries.\n\n557\n00:30:01.015 --> 00:30:02.695\nIt's at that point we'll\nfind out whether or\n\n558\n00:30:02.695 --> 00:30:07.030\nnot the relationships that we\nhave in place, are working,\n\n559\n00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:11.350\nor whether we need to readjust some of\nthose relationships to make it work.\n\n560\n00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.845\nSo don't be scared and go,\n\n561\n00:30:12.845 --> 00:30:16.492\ncrud it didn't work let me just axe\nout of the whole database here.\n\n562\n00:30:16.492 --> 00:30:20.534\nGo back and we'll take a look at that\nin our, as we do some queries here.\n\n563\n00:30:20.534 --> 00:30:22.936\nSo Vonne, thatt's pretty much it for\nwhat we have.\n\n564\n00:30:22.936 --> 00:30:26.161\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so we need to make sure\nwe build our house strong, and if\n\n565\n00:30:26.161 --> 00:30:30.610\nthe foundation isn't set or poured right,\nwe're gonna have to go do another one.\n\n566\n00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.860\nI don't know how I'm pulling\nout references of construction.\n\n567\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am getting ready to remodel my\n\n568\n00:30:35.765 --> 00:30:37.148\nkitchen so maybe-\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go, sure.\n\n569\n00:30:37.148 --> 00:30:39.419\n&gt;&gt; That's why I'm thinking about that,\nand being like gosh,\n\n570\n00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:40.589\nthis is gonna take a while [LAUGH].\n\n571\n00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:44.050\nWell, anyways, thank you so much for\nreviewing the relationships with us.\n\n572\n00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.844\nIt's driving a lot of these points home\nfor me, so I hope it's doing the same\n\n573\n00:30:47.844 --> 00:30:51.595\nthing for you, and lots of planning,\nand lots of relationship building.\n\n574\n00:30:51.595 --> 00:30:55.131\nSo, [LAUGH] we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this episode up, and\n\n575\n00:30:55.131 --> 00:30:58.531\nthen we'll go ahead and\ncontinue along with more queries.\n\n576\n00:30:58.531 --> 00:31:01.755\nSo signing off for Office ProTV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n577\n00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:02.615\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n578\n00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:04.071\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n579\n00:31:04.071 -->

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.846 --> 00:00:20.905\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and we are in\nour Access 2016 Essential series.\n\n4\n00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:26.396\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\nbe talking all about queries and\n\n5\n00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:29.935\nhow they can test for our database design.\n\n6\n00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:31.268\nWow, that was a mouth full.\n\n7\n00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:33.891\nAnd here to help me talk is Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:34.730\nHow are you?\n\n9\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.158\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am fine, Vonne.\n\n10\n00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:39.303\nThank you again for allowing me\nback into the OfficePro studios.\n\n11\n00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.291\nI don't get to get out of\nITProTV too much, but here I am.\n\n12\n00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:46.254\nI'm back and we are ready to\ntake a look at well, queries and\n\n13\n00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.328\nhelping us to test for design.\n\n14\n00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:51.745\nSo this is a very important part,\nVonne, as we get started.\n\n15\n00:00:51.745 --> 00:00:56.562\nSo Vonne, let's kind of just take a very\nquick review of where we've already\n\n16\n00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:59.092\ngotten to in this series so far, right?\n\n17\n00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.697\nWe started off by just planning\neverything out, talking about, of course,\n\n18\n00:01:02.697 --> 00:01:05.025\nwhat Access is and\nhow it helps us a little bit, but\n\n19\n00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:08.035\nwe did spend a little bit of time\nin relational database design.\n\n20\n00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:11.270\nThen we moved into the paper\nplanning of everything that we did.\n\n21\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.465\nWe established those tables.\n\n22\n00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:15.899\nWe created those table relationships.\n\n23\n00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.546\nAt that point, we went into Access of\ncourse and created those different\n\n24\n00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:25.269\ntables and then at the end of a previous\nepisode, we also established what\n\n25\n00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:30.243\nwe believe is the correct relationships\nbetween all those tables in Access.\n\n26\n00:01:30.243 --> 00:01:35.591\nSo, at that point, we actually now\nhave to go in and we have to test and\n\n27\n00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:41.065\nverify that our design is going to\nwork for what we need it to do, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.545\nAt this stage, there's two things\nthat's gonna happen, Vonne.\n\n29\n00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:47.384\nOkay, one which is gonna\nbe everything works.\n\n30\n00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:51.087\nWhen I run a select query,\nwhen I run the query that I want to,\n\n31\n00:01:51.087 --> 00:01:55.811\nI'm gonna get the exact information that\nI believe I actually want to have and\n\n32\n00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:59.248\nthat's gonna verify that\nmy design is correct, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:01.494\nBut, Vonne,\nthere's also another possibility.\n\n34\n00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:04.133\nSo, Vonne, what's the other end if\neverything is not correct here?\n\n35\n00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.586\n&gt;&gt; That it's broken.\n\n36\n00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:07.529\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's true.\n\n37\n00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:09.259\nYeah, it's absolutely broken.\n\n38\n00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.740\nNow, it doesn't mean that\nevery part of it's broken.\n\n39\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.164\nYou could have gotten\npart of the design right.\n\n40\n00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:17.316\nYou could have gotten\npart of it wrong as well.\n\n41\n00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:20.330\nAnd this is not to frighten you or\nanything, but remember,\n\n42\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.655\nif this is your first one,\n\n43\n00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:25.775\nyou gotta expect that you're probably\ngonna get it wrong more often than right.\n\n44\n00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:29.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this has actually\nbeen a huge learning process for\n\n45\n00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:32.470\nme because you actually, you tasked me.\n\n46\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.263\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; He said okay, you're gonna go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:37.570\nsit down and design this database.\n\n48\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.080\nAnd, of course, he helped me\nalong the way, but I did this.\n\n49\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.924\n&gt;&gt; It did work.\n\n50\n00:02:41.924 --> 00:02:46.922\n&gt;&gt; And it wasn't until we got\ninto this area where we actually\n\n51\n00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:50.395\nhad found a couple flaws here and there.\n\n52\n00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:55.393\nFew things were great, but\nthe possibility of it working our\n\n53\n00:02:55.393 --> 00:03:00.883\nflawlessly every single time,\nit's a small margin right there.\n\n54\n00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:05.546\nSo we've kind of incorporated our\nissues that we've found throughout\n\n55\n00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:06.718\nthese episodes.\n\n56\n00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:08.777\nThis one we're gonna have,\nit's gonna work perfectly.\n\n57\n00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:09.819\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n58\n00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.014\nwe've planned this for you all, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:14.290\nSo we're gonna make sure that this one,\nyep, it works okay.\n\n60\n00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.511\nWe're all good, but as we go through\nsome other ones, we're gonna\n\n61\n00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:23.042\ntell you what I did wrong and I'm kind\nof excited to tell you all about it.\n\n62\n00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:26.831\n[LAUGH] I've never been so excited to\ntell people how many mistakes I've made.\n\n63\n00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.981\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, the neat thing is this right,\n\n64\n00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.281\nI don't want to give you\na false impression right.\n\n65\n00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:34.478\nAnd Vonne and\nI don't wanna give you a false impression.\n\n66\n00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:38.180\nIf you did everything the way that we\ndid it, it's gonna work perfectly, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.391\nBecause you're very first time you're\nlikely to second guess yourself.\n\n68\n00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:46.143\nYou're likely to kind of do things\nthat logically seem to make sense, but\n\n69\n00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.152\nAccess goes I don't like that, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:49.977\nAnd you're just gonna have\nto learn from that, and\n\n71\n00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:52.405\nthat's what we're doing here is\nthat we're learning from those.\n\n72\n00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:55.412\nAnd we included it in because\nwe didn't want you to think that\n\n73\n00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:58.441\nI followed exactly what they said and\nit worked out perfectly.\n\n74\n00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:00.557\nYou're gonna see that if you\ndid that up to this point,\n\n75\n00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:02.677\nsome of it will work out perfectly,\nsome of it won't.\n\n76\n00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:06.172\nBut we wanted to take you through\nthat because we believe that that's\n\n77\n00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:09.805\npart of actually learning and\nunderstanding how Access works as well.\n\n78\n00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:13.610\nAnd the best place to begin\nhere when we start to test for\n\n79\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.855\ndesign and it working inside\nof Access is building queries.\n\n80\n00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:20.586\nAnd so that's what we're going to begin\nwith is we need to understand queries at\n\n81\n00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:21.172\nthe beginning.\n\n82\n00:04:21.172 --> 00:04:25.630\n&gt;&gt; All right so like you said, a query,\nand let me see if I got this right,\n\n83\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.351\na query is where we're\nasking a question of\n\n84\n00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.674\nour tables of our information to\ntry to retrieve something from it.\n\n85\n00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:35.354\n&gt;&gt; Right, remember,\nwe can all ask questions.\n\n86\n00:04:35.354 --> 00:04:39.148\nBut the very fact is in database\nterminology a query or a quary,\n\n87\n00:04:39.148 --> 00:04:43.302\ndepending on who you learned it from,\nwe're asking that question,\n\n88\n00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:47.049\nbut we're trying to retrieve\nthe answers from our database.\n\n89\n00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:51.115\nAnd what is generated as a result\nof those queries is what we've\n\n90\n00:04:51.115 --> 00:04:53.273\nactually termed as a record set.\n\n91\n00:04:53.273 --> 00:04:56.612\nNow it's gonna look in the end\nresult like a table, but\n\n92\n00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:58.653\nit's kind of a temporary table.\n\n93\n00:04:58.653 --> 00:05:02.060\nWe're not really creating another\nstructure at the end of the query.\n\n94\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.790\nBut what we're doing here is\nwe're actually creating what we\n\n95\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.678\nbelieve is a result from all of\nthose different tables that we've\n\n96\n00:05:07.678 --> 00:05:10.531\nnow have connected together in\nthe relationships that we have.\n\n97\n00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.555\nAnd we believe that we can\nrun a query against them and\n\n98\n00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:18.111\nretrieve the exact information we are\nexpecting to see when we run this query.\n\n99\n00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:21.809\nSo that's why it is important that we\nunderstand this idea of the query.\n\n100\n00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:25.506\nThere are multiple types of\nqueries that are available to us,\n\n101\n00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:29.772\nespecially in Access and in the real\nworld and working with databases,\n\n102\n00:05:29.772 --> 00:05:34.199\nwe can actually do queries that do more\nthan just show us the information.\n\n103\n00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.238\nWe're gonna start with just\nshowing the information, and\n\n104\n00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:40.285\nwe'll talk about why we actually\nwanna do that in a moment.\n\n105\n00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:44.483\nBut I do wanna take the time to at least\nshow you some of the different types of\n\n106\n00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:47.630\nqueries that you can run in\nAccess to help us out, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.682\nSo Vonne, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine, and\n\n108\n00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.401\nthis will get us started, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:53.483\nSo here it is.\n\n110\n00:05:53.483 --> 00:05:57.035\nHere's my Access database that\nI have open on dancing dogs.\n\n111\n00:05:57.035 --> 00:06:00.740\nHere's all of the actual different\ntables that I have over here.\n\n112\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.727\nAnd then I've got a couple of queries\ndown here on the left-hand side.\n\n113\n00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:06.111\nThese were just for\ntesting and for practice, and\n\n114\n00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.814\njust trying to make sure that everything\nwas working the way that I want it to.\n\n115\n00:06:09.814 --> 00:06:13.656\nBut up here at the top, just to show\nyou some of the different ones, but\n\n116\n00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:16.928\nwe're actually gonna take a look\nin this group right here.\n\n117\n00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:20.155\nThat is called well queries grouping.\n\n118\n00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:24.323\nNotice that there's a query wizard and\nthere's a query design, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:29.050\nNow for us to be able to take a look at\nsome of the different types of queries\n\n120\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.719\nthat you and I can create, I'm simply\ngonna click on the query design.\n\n121\n00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.214\nAnd I'm gonna close out\nof the show tables for\n\n122\n00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:39.900\na moment cuz I want to focus in on\nthe query types is what I want to do.\n\n123\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.772\nSo up at the top, notice that\nthe Contextual Design tab has shown up\n\n124\n00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:49.210\nunderneath the query tools and\nnow I have these query types.\n\n125\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.157\nSo in the query types here,\nwe're really gonna focus on this\n\n126\n00:06:54.157 --> 00:06:58.524\nfirst big table or\nicons that you see right over here.\n\n127\n00:06:58.524 --> 00:07:03.319\nThese are more advanced types of them too,\nbut we're really gonna be focusing on this\n\n128\n00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.463\none for at least this particular show,\nwhich is the select query, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:07.463 --> 00:07:10.223\nThe select query,\nwhen we start describing this,\n\n130\n00:07:10.223 --> 00:07:13.495\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to go into our database,\n\n131\n00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:17.494\nwhether it's actually a single table or\nwhether it's multiple tables.\n\n132\n00:07:17.494 --> 00:07:20.285\nAnd we're gonna tell it\nI need to actually pull\n\n133\n00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:25.026\ninformation from these particular fields\nand I need you to display them to me.\n\n134\n00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:27.185\nAnd when it displays it to you,\n\n135\n00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:32.185\nit's actually making a copy of that\ninformation and showing it to you.\n\n136\n00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:36.946\nNow that copy itself does not turn into\na permanent table even though it actually\n\n137\n00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:40.515\ndoes look like a table at the end\nin the result when we see it.\n\n138\n00:07:40.515 --> 00:07:41.736\n&gt;&gt; Could this be similar?\n\n139\n00:07:41.736 --> 00:07:44.401\nCuz what I'm thinking\nright now again Excel,\n\n140\n00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.870\nI want to filter out certain information.\n\n141\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.033\nI mean we could kinda use\nthat term of show me all of\n\n142\n00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:54.296\nthe products that were sold in Tampa.\n\n143\n00:07:54.296 --> 00:07:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's to me in my Excel thinking like\n\n144\n00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.315\na filter.\n\n145\n00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:00.123\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n146\n00:08:00.123 --> 00:08:03.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's very similar in what we can do there.\n\n147\n00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:07.941\nAnd the difference is that we can actually\nnow do it between multiple tables wherein\n\n148\n00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:13.150\nthe Excel analogy we could do it between\nmultiple spreadsheets using one query.\n\n149\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.970\nWhereas instead inside Excel,\nyou'd have to actually run it probably\n\n150\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.000\non each spreadsheet to give you\nthe results that you want to.\n\n151\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.850\nAnd also in Excel,\n\n152\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.260\nwhen you put it someplace it actually\ndoes become another sheet as well.\n\n153\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.990\nWhere this is just temporary.\n\n154\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.000\nIt's actually just gonna be stored in\nRAM until you actually need it again.\n\n155\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.220\nYou can save the query, in other words,\ntell it hey, I wanna run this again.\n\n156\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.640\nBut it's not gonna save the results for\nyou.\n\n157\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.180\nUnless you actually do make\nit into a table of some sort.\n\n158\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI didn't wanna get too far ahead,\n\n159\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.180\nbut the cool thing that I learned\nfrom all of this is, okay,\n\n160\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.110\nI'm asking this question, what we said,\nthe products of a city or what have you.\n\n161\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.420\nAnd then it's there two months later.\n\n162\n00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.700\nI could go ahead,\nI've already got the parameters.\n\n163\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.840\nI just run it again and it's, bloop.\n\n164\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.298\nAnd it's, it's a copy of everything.\n\n165\n00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:01.590\nSo it's kinda just like I don't\nhave to reset it up or anything.\n\n166\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.910\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Just click the little button and\n\n167\n00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.860\nit goes again.\n\n168\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.470\nThat's kind of a cool feature that\ndoes start to separate it from\n\n169\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.360\nExcel in a sense.\n\n170\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.030\n&gt;&gt; It really does,\n\n171\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.600\nit allows you to be able update the data\nas well as add in whatever's appended.\n\n172\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.190\nAnd your just running that command\nagain to tell it to retrieve the newest\n\n173\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.270\ninformation.\n\n174\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.450\nSo you will see this changing, and\n\n175\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.140\nthat's kinda the key also\ninside of Access as well.\n\n176\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.490\nIs that it can dynamically\nhandle that information and\n\n177\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.470\ngenerate those reports that we need or\nthose queries that we need\n\n178\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.810\nto give us the exact information at the\nproper time that we also want it to, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.720\nNow there's some other ones that we're\ngonna get into into more advanced Excel\n\n180\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.130\nshows as we're going to.\n\n181\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.610\nSo Jessie, I get the Make Table, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.480\nNow the make table, let me just\nsee if I can select on that one.\n\n183\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.280\nOops and\nyou'll see that kind of brings up this.\n\n184\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.180\nLet me just hover over so that we can get\nto the tool is what I want to do, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.910\nSo it says make the query select\nrecords from the database and\n\n186\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.560\nsave the records as a new table.\n\n187\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.910\nSo this thing generates\na couple of different things.\n\n188\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.700\nFirst and foremost, it says, hey, what\ndo you want me to select and display for\n\n189\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.640\nyou, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.290\nThen secondly,\nit actually turns it into a table,\n\n191\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.430\nwhich will then make it a table\nover here inside of Access.\n\n192\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.760\nNow I did run this query\ninside of our design,\n\n193\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.070\nif you remember this one\nfrom previous episode.\n\n194\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.210\nWe had to create something special\nthat's a little bit more advanced\n\n195\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.840\nthat we called a junction table, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.700\nAnd I had labelled it here with a JT,\nso that I remember.\n\n197\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.528\nSo this is not\nJustin Timberlake [CROSSTALK].\n\n198\n00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:30.136\n&gt;&gt; Which I thought it was.\n\n199\n00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:31.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You thought it was.\n\n200\n00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:36.550\nThis is actually gonna be,\nof course, a junction table.\n\n201\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.200\nNow for me, I could have done\nthis in a couple of ways.\n\n202\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.780\nBut making that make table wizard,\nI just chose the fields that I wanted in\n\n203\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.260\nthose two tables, and I ran a query and\nthen actually generated it.\n\n204\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.680\nThen, once I did that,\n\n205\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.240\nI was able to turn it into a table\nby running that make table.\n\n206\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.070\nAnd I just gave it name and\nit literally made a brand new table for\n\n207\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.415\nme with the proper information\nalready populated into it.\n\n208\n00:11:03.415 --> 00:11:07.860\nIt's really great because it means I don't\nhave to go and find the information and\n\n209\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.470\nthen try and populate each particular\ncolumn or field at the time.\n\n210\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.840\nSo it is good tool so we can actually\nupdate our entire database and\n\n211\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.740\nwe need to by creating new tables,\nas well.\n\n212\n00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.660\nWe also have the ability\nto append the query, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.950\nSo notice here it says make the query\nadd records to an existing table.\n\n214\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:35.540\nNow, this is from another table into\na table that's already existing.\n\n215\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.730\nOr what it can be as from a query.\n\n216\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.310\nSo, you might actually run a query,\nyou might have imported them let's say\n\n217\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.910\ntwo additional tables in to\nthis data base that you have.\n\n218\n00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.890\nYou created a query and\n\n219\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.760\nyou wanted actually generate kind\nof a hybrid result in them that\n\n220\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.040\nactually result in that field like your\ncustomer's table let's take example.\n\n221\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.780\nWell then you can actually take that and\nactually make it append not\n\n222\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.630\noverwriting information inside\nof your customer's table.\n\n223\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.870\nBut actually add it on at the end.\n\n224\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.860\nSo the append query allows\nyou do that as well.\n\n225\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.290\n&gt;&gt; Now we did something like\nappending when we imported data.\n\n226\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:18.580\n&gt;&gt; So this is making me think it's\nkinda similar, but it's not, is it?\n\n228\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where are the differences?\n\n229\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nWell, the import is what it sounds like.\n\n230\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.830\nIt's coming from an external source,\nright?\n\n231\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n232\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.020\nwith the external source we're gonna\nimport that in, but then the same thing.\n\n233\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.350\nThe append kinda works in the same\nway I've already done the import.\n\n234\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.760\nNormally we're not gonna append\nthe data to it unless we already\n\n235\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.290\nhave the data existing somewhere, and it\ncould exist in like you did go ahead and\n\n236\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.710\nimport a table in and then you wanna\nactually add that into another table.\n\n237\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this append query is more\nlike a closed circuit in a sense.\n\n238\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.870\nIt has already be in Access, we can't\ngo and externally grab information.\n\n239\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.070\nAll right there's a clarification for me.\n\n240\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cause I just heard append we did this.\n\n241\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No that's\n\n242\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.750\nimporting from an external source.\n\n243\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.360\nThis is appending from and\ninternal source if you wanna say.\n\n244\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, well if you think about\nyou have to import it first and\n\n245\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.020\nthen you can append to another\ntable if you wanted to.\n\n246\n00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I think the practical reason is\n\n247\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.060\nthe one that I told you.\n\n248\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.520\nYou might end up finding out that when\nyou already had customers in one table.\n\n249\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.920\nBut you have broken into part but\nthat's actually part of good example.\n\n250\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.420\nYou'd actually decided that\nyou're customer's table,\n\n251\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.010\nyou actually have like customer's details\n\n252\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.670\nwhere you only have the customer ID\nmatched up to the loyalty ID program.\n\n253\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.570\nAnd then you actually have another table\nabout the customer personal details were\n\n254\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.880\nactually included in their name,\nand their address, and everything.\n\n255\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.050\nBut you really wanted to\ncombine that together, so\n\n256\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.370\nthat you could import it directly\ninto this customer's table here.\n\n257\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.830\nWell, you can actually run do\nan import of those two tables and\n\n258\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.030\nthen make them run a query together.\n\n259\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.680\nAnd then tell it I wanna import that\ninformation into the customer's table.\n\n260\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.570\nIs a little bit convoluted in that.\n\n261\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.670\nBut it actually does work\nas a practical example.\n\n262\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.290\nSame thing if you want to Update a table.\n\n263\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:11.920\nYou can make query update to update\nthe data in an existing table.\n\n264\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.798\nSo we hopefully don't do this too often,\nbut\n\n265\n00:14:14.798 --> 00:14:20.060\nit can happen where you chose to change\nthe name of a product for one reason.\n\n266\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.020\nOr you chose to actually\nchange a designation\n\n267\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.160\nto something that internal\nsomething that you actually had\n\n268\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.180\nyou appended in like you added\nin a prefix to some number.\n\n269\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.300\nYou can actually append the data and\n\n270\n00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.090\nmake sure everything actually\nhappens that way too.\n\n271\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.230\n&gt;&gt; Could this be something like\nif we change a unit price or\n\n272\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.950\na unit price from a manufacturer change.\n\n273\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n274\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.670\nAnd then we wanted to update all purple\ntutu's that by 10% or something.\n\n275\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.760\nIs that something we could do here?\n\n276\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes we can.\n\n277\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.480\nThat's a good example for\nus to actually think of.\n\n278\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.200\nSomething like that could\nactually be possible as well.\n\n279\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.390\nSo if you do have updates to that instead\nof you having to manually going to change\n\n280\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.050\nevery individual one,\nyou got a list from someone and\n\n281\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.680\nit actually said, here it is in Excel\nspreadsheet, here's all the updates.\n\n282\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.940\nYou can import that in and\n\n283\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.090\nthen run an update against\nthat now that there's a table.\n\n284\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.760\nAnd actually make it up.\n\n285\n00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, find purple tutu,\nthis is the new unit price.\n\n286\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.150\nFind purple tutu large,\nthis is the new price.\n\n287\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It would do that?\n\n288\n00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:14.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n289\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.100\n&gt;&gt; It'll let you do that.\n\n290\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.140\nNow the only, I'm gonna skip over\nCrosstab because this is kind of unusual.\n\n291\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.880\nSummarizing the tremendous amount\nof data in a tabular form.\n\n292\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.680\nSo we can do that.\n\n293\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.950\nBut this is a little but more and unusual\nfor us and is way beyond what we need so\n\n294\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.250\nwe gonna kinda skip this one for now.\n\n295\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.020\nBut there is also Delete, this is the one\nyou should be scared about, okay.\n\n296\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.728\nAnd the reason why is that when\nyou run this, notice it says,\n\n297\n00:15:38.728 --> 00:15:42.295\nmake the query delete existing\ninformation, excuse me,\n\n298\n00:15:42.295 --> 00:15:47.056\nthe information from an existing table\nwhere the data matches the criteria.\n\n299\n00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:51.799\nAt the end of this it's gonna ask you\na very good question when you run this,\n\n300\n00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:53.164\nlike, are you sure?\n\n301\n00:15:53.164 --> 00:15:56.905\nAnd it's gonna tell you,\nyou're about to delete 56 records.\n\n302\n00:15:56.905 --> 00:16:00.337\nWell, that doesn't sound bad as\nlong as you only have 56 record and\n\n303\n00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:02.545\nyou might delete everything out of of 57.\n\n304\n00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:07.990\nBut if you have hundreds of records or\nthousands of records which 56 is not gonna\n\n305\n00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.270\ntell you at the end which ones it deleted,\nyou have to know which once it deleted.\n\n306\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.738\nAnd it's easy to make sense if\nyou chose a criteria would work,\n\n307\n00:16:14.738 --> 00:16:17.780\nit is always a little bit scary I would\n\n308\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.000\nbe careful about using this delete unless\nyou know exactly what you're doing.\n\n309\n00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.950\nMy recommendation, once again, is make\nsure that you actually make a back up of\n\n310\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.980\nthe original data base, run the delete\nquery on your back up data base.\n\n311\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.770\nOr on your testing data\nbase at this point.\n\n312\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.310\nSee if it actually deletes out the record\nthat you expect to delete out.\n\n313\n00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.730\nAnd I'm only delete that\nthen you're fine and\n\n314\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.740\nyou know that you can do that\non your real data as well, okay?\n\n315\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:50.220\nSo never practice these types of select\non something that's actually gonna be\n\n316\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.140\nA database that you can't be able, to\nafford, that's the word I was looking for.\n\n317\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.540\nYou can't afford to lose the data, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.500\nSo once you actually do run it against\nthat kind of test dummy, to do so,\n\n319\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.490\nthen you can do that.\n\n320\n00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.190\nThe great thing about Access is because of\nthe way that it's stored as a single file,\n\n321\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:08.920\nit's easy for\n\n322\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.450\nyou just to right-click on the file in\nwhatever system that you're offering.\n\n323\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.730\nYou either make a copy or\nto duplicate it or whatever.\n\n324\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.850\nAnd then just change the name and\nthen try and run that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n325\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.200\nNow this could really work, it's great.\n\n326\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.760\nSo now you can just kind of close\nthat out and run it again and\n\n327\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.710\nnow you actually know what it's doing.\n\n328\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.130\nThere are a few other ones over here, but\n\n329\n00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.660\nif we can at least start with just\nthe simple ones right, select And\n\n330\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.130\nunderstand these, well we're gonna\nget to those in some more advanced\n\n331\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.385\naccess as we go on, but\nwe do wanna start off with select.\n\n332\n00:17:40.385 --> 00:17:40.990\nBecause if you notice,\n\n333\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.280\nlike all the ones that we talked about,\nit really begins with a select anyway.\n\n334\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.360\nOkay, so\nif we can actually run a select query,\n\n335\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.650\nwell it means that we actually have the\nfoundation for running everything else.\n\n336\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.100\nSo that is where we are going so start.\n\n337\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.270\nSo I'm going to close out of\nthis from the query design, and\n\n338\n00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.760\nthen let's take a look once\nagain at the two views.\n\n339\n00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.545\nSo we're actually going\nto run through both.\n\n340\n00:18:05.545 --> 00:18:10.635\nAnd if we're doing this for testing Von,\nI recommend that we do both, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:10.635 --> 00:18:11.835\nAnd there's a reason behind that.\n\n342\n00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:15.665\nNotice that there's a Query Wizard which\nagain is actually is just a wizard and\n\n343\n00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:19.585\nyou'd simply choose your criteria and\nonce you choose your criteria,\n\n344\n00:18:19.585 --> 00:18:23.285\nyou're ready to go and\nyou simply click next and you're done.\n\n345\n00:18:23.285 --> 00:18:26.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the next next\nfinished way of doing things and\n\n346\n00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:31.230\nit does it all the background you go\n&gt;&gt; Alright perfect, and we're done.\n\n347\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.985\nAnd that's good-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n348\n00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:35.570\n&gt;&gt; Because if it works, then it works.\n\n349\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.130\nThe design view is more\ngetting into where you\n\n350\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.090\ndesign every part of\nthe query that you want.\n\n351\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.560\nIt still has the interface\nDecently simple for you.\n\n352\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But those are the two ways.\n\n353\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.120\nAnd I'm assuming we're gonna probably\ntake the Wizard approach first right?\n\n354\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, and there's a good reason for\nit, so somebody will just say no\n\n355\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.890\nopen up design view and don't worry\nabout running it inside of the query.\n\n356\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.780\nIf you're new to Access right, and\nyou're not sure how this is gonna work.\n\n357\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.180\nYou're gonna see that when we start to\ncreate queries in Access it's going to be\n\n358\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.270\nrelatively simple and we even show\nyou some of the other methods.\n\n359\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.980\nWhich there's one more I need to show you\nthere and when we get to it I'll do that.\n\n360\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.120\nBut over here in the query wizard,\n\n361\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.530\nremember that Access has\nessentially made this work.\n\n362\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:24.640\nSo if you don't know if your design\nis good or is not whatever it is.\n\n363\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.540\nThe great thing is, the Query Wizard\nwill go ahead and actually try and\n\n364\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.350\nmake it work, and if it doesn't,\nit may even ask you if it can fix it,\n\n365\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.040\nor it may actually say there's something\nthat's still there that I can't run, or\n\n366\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.360\nI can't fix.\n\n367\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.030\nBut if it can fix it,\nmy particular advice,\n\n368\n00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.940\ntake it for whatever that's worth,\nit may not be worth anything.\n\n369\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.160\nBut my recommendation is,\nif you get the result you're looking for,\n\n370\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.160\ndo not go back and try and figure\nout what they did to make this work.\n\n371\n00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.280\nIn other words, don't try and go,\n\n372\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.620\nall right,\nhere's what they did to make it work.\n\n373\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.220\nYou're just, accept it for\nwhat it is, because, if not,\n\n374\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.810\nyou're gonna see things that\nyou're not going to want to see.\n\n375\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.870\nAnd that's when it's actually gonna\nbe a little bit more hefty on you,\n\n376\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.530\nbecause you're gonna try and\nfigure it out and it's not gonna work.\n\n377\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.000\nBecause they're gonna actually\nmake these unusual things here,\n\n378\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.690\nthat's gonna make the query\nall work together.\n\n379\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.640\nSo, you'll actually get that, all right?\n\n380\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.220\nSo, the easiest thing to\ndo then is to go ahead and\n\n381\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.110\nstart off with that Query Wizard.\n\n382\n00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.200\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n383\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.140\nAll right, so\nI've selected the query wizard and\n\n384\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:34.050\nyou'll see right here, here it is,\na nice dialogue box for us.\n\n385\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.420\nAnd notice we have four\ndifferent wizards here.\n\n386\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.860\nNow, I do wanna kinda point out one thing.\n\n387\n00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.550\nWe're really doing this for\nthe idea of testing, okay.\n\n388\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.230\nNow if you go, I love the wizard and\nI wanna use it for\n\n389\n00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.890\nthe rest of my life,\nI don't care about anything else.\n\n390\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.790\nAwesome, okay?\n\n391\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.530\nIt will work.\n\n392\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.620\nYou'll be able to do it all day long and\nit will work for you.\n\n393\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.670\nBut the other thing that also added in\nhere, where notice these three other\n\n394\n00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:03.150\nwizards, okay, crosstab,\nfind duplicates, find unmatched queries.\n\n395\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:08.590\nAnd it doesn't sound like much,\nbut if you kinda read this here.\n\n396\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.538\nThe wizard creates a crosstab\nquery that displays a compact,\n\n397\n00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:14.414\nspreadsheet-like format.\n\n398\n00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:15.970\nWell, that's a lot.\n\n399\n00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.790\nAnd what I mean by that is That is\na more complex Query than you and\n\n400\n00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.240\nI might have actually\nthought about trying to do.\n\n401\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.980\nSo what access has done is, it said look,\nif you wanna create a crosstab,\n\n402\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.000\nthat's perfectly fine, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.430\nBut let us do it for you.\n\n404\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.090\nYou just pick out what you want to be\ndisplayed, and let us do the cross tabbing\n\n405\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.810\nfor you Don't worry about it, we'll\nactually make sure it displays correctly\n\n406\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.010\nif you picked up the fields that\nyou want to that's what we'll do,\n\n407\n00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.670\nyou don't have to worry about trying to\nfigure out the rest and how that's done.\n\n408\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.530\nFinding duplicates may\nactually be another one\n\n409\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:56.520\nthat may be a little bit more challenging\nthan you think, and then finding unmatched\n\n410\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.910\nquery is may be a little bit more\nchallenging than what you think as well.\n\n411\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.150\nSo here they've gone ahead and\n\n412\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.170\ncreated some that are probably a little\nbit more difficult than for the person\n\n413\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.190\njust beginning with their database\nskills to try and find this stuff.\n\n414\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:12.090\nSo they do add in not only the very simple\nthing, which is the one we're gonna use,\n\n415\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.725\nbut also Little bit more\ncomplex things in there, too.\n\n416\n00:22:14.725 --> 00:22:18.575\n&gt;&gt; But you can, I mean I just,\nfrom my experience, the duplicates,\n\n417\n00:22:18.575 --> 00:22:24.205\nyou can't have two of the same employees,\nwith the employee record and everything.\n\n418\n00:22:24.205 --> 00:22:25.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, cuz that could be a\n\n419\n00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:25.973\n&gt;&gt; A big issue.\n\n420\n00:22:25.973 --> 00:22:26.694\n&gt;&gt; It can be.\n\n421\n00:22:26.694 --> 00:22:31.757\n&gt;&gt; So that right there I'm like,\nooh, I can see where I'd like that.\n\n422\n00:22:31.757 --> 00:22:33.837\nI'm half and half and I want back.\n\n423\n00:22:33.837 --> 00:22:36.677\nI'm sure we'll get to it eventually\nsomewhere down the road in another,\n\n424\n00:22:36.677 --> 00:22:37.997\nin another theories.\n\n425\n00:22:37.997 --> 00:22:42.567\nMaybe like advances access or\nanything that, but I can see that one.\n\n426\n00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Yup, so let just select\nthis simple query wizard here.\n\n427\n00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.580\nAnd click okay.\n\n428\n00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.080\nWhen we do this,\nnotice I actually have a simple wizard.\n\n429\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.600\nNow, I'm gonna throw a little\nbit of a curve ball.\n\n430\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.120\nLet's just do one table for right now and\nthat way I can show you something.\n\n431\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.000\nAnd then, we're gonna actually\ndo one where we actually\n\n432\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.300\ncreate multiple tables here.\n\n433\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.340\nAnd it's so quick, that's what I\nwanna be able to do this, okay.\n\n434\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.490\nSo right at the beginning we're testing\nvon I wanna verify that I can just simply\n\n435\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.330\nretrieve the records and\nit's gonna show me everything.\n\n436\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.270\nWell, I can pick any of my tables,\nI could pick all of them but that would be\n\n437\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.200\na mistake, don't pick all of them, cuz you\nwanna see if this things actually work.\n\n438\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.190\nSo I'm just gonna pick the customers\ntab cuz that's the one that has all\n\n439\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.650\nthe information I want.\n\n440\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.830\nIf I want to clear it for\nevery available field,\n\n441\n00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.430\nthat´s actually listed in here,\nI can click on this double arrow.\n\n442\n00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.570\nThere you go, every single is in there.\n\n443\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:40.710\nNow, if I only want to choose a field,\nsuch as Customer ID, I have two options.\n\n444\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.560\nI can click on the right arrow and\n\n445\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.700\nthat will put him there\n&gt;&gt; Or, I can even double click on them.\n\n446\n00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.810\nAnd also add that in there as well.\n\n447\n00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.030\nSo, that's what those arrows are for,\nif you choose do this.\n\n448\n00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.545\nNow, I'm actually gonna\nselect all of those fields.\n\n449\n00:23:54.545 --> 00:23:57.769\nJust so\nI can verify that the theory is working.\n\n450\n00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:59.867\nAnd I have my tables.\n\n451\n00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:03.273\nClick next, and\nnow I'm not gonna worry about the summary.\n\n452\n00:24:03.273 --> 00:24:05.080\nI'm gonna show all the details here.\n\n453\n00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.560\nClick finish.\n\n454\n00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.390\nAnd then we're gonna give it\njust a basic name here, okay.\n\n455\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:16.230\nAnd we're just gonna do QRY, which is\nthe prefix that we're gonna add in this.\n\n456\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.670\nFor tables, we did TBL,\nwe're gonna do queries here,\n\n457\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:24.440\nand we're just gonna do just\nCustomersTable, just as an example.\n\n458\n00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.739\nAnd open it, let's see,\nI don't wanna modify it.\n\n459\n00:24:27.739 --> 00:24:30.490\nI wanna click Finish, and there we go.\n\n460\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.230\nHere's the results, let me see if I\ncan collapse this down for a moment.\n\n461\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.670\nAnd what we're looking for\nright now is, did the information,\n\n462\n00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.920\nright, show up what I\nexpected it to show up?\n\n463\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.880\nIt should.\n\n464\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.480\nIf you entered in the data,\nyou should know what actually shows up.\n\n465\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.940\nThat is at least a verification that a\nsimple query is working against one table.\n\n466\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.290\nBut that's not the only\nreason why we run queries.\n\n467\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.900\nWe also run them against multiple tables.\n\n468\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.400\nAnd that's where the testing comes in.\n\n469\n00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.830\n&gt;&gt; And that's where we're gonna hopefully\nbe able to determine if our relationships.\n\n470\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Work out properly where it\n\n471\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.370\nactually understands.\n\n472\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.120\nYou're talking about two tables.\n\n473\n00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.790\nI know how they relate to each other, so I\ncan talk to the two tables and everything.\n\n474\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.850\nCuz right now, well, people might be,\nwell, that's just how it is in the table.\n\n475\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.960\nBut again, it's just the whole, I'm asking\naccess to retrieve the information,\n\n476\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.170\nthat's what I'm testing.\n\n477\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.950\nEven though it seems like\nthe simplest thing ever.\n\n478\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.950\nIf this doesn't work,\nthen we've got a problem.\n\n479\n00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this problem could\nactually be anywhere at this point.\n\n480\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.880\nSo it could be something that\nhappened when we created the table.\n\n481\n00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.570\nIt could be something that all of\nthe sudden we realize that there's a blank\n\n482\n00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.900\nfield in here and we're,\nwhy is that field blank?\n\n483\n00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.750\nOkay, so that's fairly simple.\n\n484\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.080\nAll right, so now let's get back to it,\nnow that I state it, I'm gonna say no.\n\n485\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.130\nDon't worry about saving the changes here.\n\n486\n00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.800\nWe're gonna run the query\nwizard one more time.\n\n487\n00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.480\nAnd now we're gonna do it against\nmultiple tables that we believe\n\n488\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.530\nare actually going to work here.\n\n489\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.280\nThe way that we do this against multiple\ntables is kind of the same way.\n\n490\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.790\nI wanna find out what customers\nbought what products, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.080\nVonne, that's what I really\nwant to find out here.\n\n492\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.060\nSo I can select the Customer ID, and\nlet's do first name and last name.\n\n493\n00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.150\nFor me to add in\nan additional table in here,\n\n494\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.170\nI select the dropdown and then,\nlet me zoom in so that we can see, sorry.\n\n495\n00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.420\nOkay, then I'm gonna select the products,\nokay?\n\n496\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.656\nNow, when I do this,\nremember what happened here, right?\n\n497\n00:26:28.656 --> 00:26:30.540\nIf we kind of go back a few episodes,\n\n498\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.700\nright, I can't directly\nconnect customers to product.\n\n499\n00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.600\nThere has to be sales in between.\n\n500\n00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.410\nSo I know that the sales\ntable is in between.\n\n501\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.080\nI also created that junction\ntable in between there, okay?\n\n502\n00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.050\nSo all this is working in the background,\nand this will verify to me whether or\n\n503\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.050\nnot the test actually does work, okay?\n\n504\n00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.710\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're going through a couple\nof tables here, like you just said.\n\n505\n00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.809\nGoing back,\nif you look at the diagram that we have.\n\n506\n00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.880\nYeah, there's a couple levels in here.\n\n507\n00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.490\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n508\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.660\nSo I'm just gonna pick out\njust a few more fields here.\n\n509\n00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.440\nSo customer first name, last name,\nand then item number and item name.\n\n510\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Can I ask a silly question?\n\n511\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; I notice you're applying in customer\n\n512\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.460\nID and item number,\nI mean is that because, do you have to?\n\n513\n00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.170\nBecause I know they're primary keys and\neverything, but you're just wanting,\n\n514\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.300\nbecause that's just what you wanna see.\n\n515\n00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not like you have to pull\n\n516\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.790\nthe primary key in each one to make it\nconnect, there's nothing about that.\n\n517\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.260\nI could just have first, last, item, name.\n\n518\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Name.\n\n519\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually let's do that.\n\n520\n00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.740\nThat way we don't confuse.\n\n521\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.770\nNotice I don't even have\nto pull in everything,\n\n522\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.890\nI could even do a manufacture\nif I wanted to.\n\n523\n00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.570\nSo let's just add in\nsomething just on the fly.\n\n524\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.740\nI don't know if that actually gonna\nmake sense, but let's do that, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.590\nNow that I've got that set, I click Next.\n\n526\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.690\nLet me see if I can move this over.\n\n527\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:43.895\nThen I'm not gonna worry about the summary\ninformation and then click Next, and\n\n528\n00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:49.032\nthis one is gonna be Customers_Products-\n&gt;&gt; And QR.\n\n529\n00:27:49.032 --> 00:27:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, yeah.\n\n530\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.060\nThere you go.\n\n531\n00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.660\nQRY.\nThen I'm gonna open and click Finish and\n\n532\n00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.845\nnow notice there it is Vonn.\n\n533\n00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:05.120\n&gt;&gt; We actually were able to pull in,\nexactly what particular customer,\n\n534\n00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.280\nfirst name, last name,\nwhat item they bought,\n\n535\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.898\nas well as the manufacturer Squeaky Shoes.\n\n536\n00:28:14.898 --> 00:28:18.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Squeaky Shoes as a manufacturer.\n\n537\n00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.770\nAnd here's one that Vonn wants\nme to say right here, okay?\n\n538\n00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.120\nSo notice that there's\ncouple of them here.\n\n539\n00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.447\nAnd we'll talk about this one in a little\nbit later on as we continue to go through\n\n540\n00:28:28.447 --> 00:28:29.620\nhere as well, okay?\n\n541\n00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:34.022\nBut notice here, David Brown,\nBarktastic Bow Ties.\n\n542\n00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:36.478\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here, okay, and Toto's Tutus.\n\n543\n00:28:36.478 --> 00:28:38.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n544\n00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.930\nSo you can see that at least at this\npoint, right, it seemed like our queries\n\n545\n00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:48.150\nare working, okay, and\nwhat we really wanted to actually do.\n\n546\n00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.090\nBut this is using something\nthat access the same look.\n\n547\n00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.810\nYou put it,\n\n548\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:58.190\nI'm not even gonna look at the design\nof your database relationships, okay?\n\n549\n00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.820\nIt says, if you can actually\nhave those tables on there,\n\n550\n00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.260\nI can make the queries work, okay?\n\n551\n00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.400\nSo even the background,\nit may actually be changing everything and\n\n552\n00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.900\nadding in more stuff in\nthere than you think.\n\n553\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.875\nDon't look at it, okay?\n\n554\n00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:15.770\nIf you're getting the right results\nthe same look, I'll make it work, okay?\n\n555\n00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.558\nBut if you wanna actually know\nhow it actually works and\n\n556\n00:29:18.558 --> 00:29:21.708\nhow to make it structured right,\nthat means we have to go in and\n\n557\n00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:24.772\nactually manually design\nthe actual queries themselves.\n\n558\n00:29:24.772 --> 00:29:28.150\n&gt;&gt; And just a follow up,\nif this was broken,\n\n559\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:33.400\nit would give us cannot display records or\nnothing's happening.\n\n560\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.030\nI mean, is there a warning or\nsomething or is it just nothing?\n\n561\n00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, there's a couple\nof things that can happen, okay?\n\n562\n00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.555\nOne, it could display to your results, but\nthey're not what you're expecting to see.\n\n563\n00:29:45.555 --> 00:29:46.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n564\n00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.050\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n565\n00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.800\nin other words, if you go look, I know\nthat there's, down here 136 records.\n\n566\n00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.690\nIf it only displays me ten records,\nthen I'm probably wondering,\n\n567\n00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.550\nwhy did it only display ten?\n\n568\n00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.250\nEverything in those tables\nhad all those fields, so\n\n569\n00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.880\nwhy did it only display 10,\nwhen I'm expecting to see 136, okay?\n\n570\n00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.060\nSo, that can happen.\n\n571\n00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.590\nThe other thing that could also happen is,\nit gives you a result,\n\n572\n00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.610\nbut nothing shows up.\n\n573\n00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n574\n00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.670\n&gt;&gt; And I, we're gonna show you guys this,\nbut I'm just kinda foreshadowing in\n\n575\n00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.380\na sense of the question of,\nyou're not always gonna get a warning box.\n\n576\n00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.560\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Where it says, cannot do it.\n\n577\n00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.160\nIt's just like, it'll run,\nbut it won't be right.\n\n578\n00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n579\n00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.370\nthat's just knowing your data and\neverything.\n\n580\n00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.470\nBut guess what?\n\n581\n00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.564\nYou'll see some of that, so.\n\n582\n00:30:31.564 --> 00:30:34.850\nBut like you said we're gonna do some\nmore stuff in design view because yes,\n\n583\n00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.420\nwe are out of time for\nthis particular episode, Ronnie.\n\n584\n00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.385\nBut don't worry, we're gonna have a lot of\nmore in this particular area of querying\n\n585\n00:30:42.385 --> 00:30:43.955\nand testing our design.\n\n586\n00:30:43.955 --> 00:30:46.695\nSo come back and\nwe're gonna do design view next.\n\n587\n00:30:46.695 --> 00:30:48.415\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll move on to some other\n\n588\n00:30:48.415 --> 00:30:48.955\nfun stuffs.\n\n589\n00:30:48.955 --> 00:30:50.887\nLet's go ahead and wrap it up today.\n\n590\n00:30:50.887 --> 00:30:53.987\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n591\n00:30:53.987 --> 00:30:54.787\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n592\n00:30:54.787 --> 00:30:55.492\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n593\n00:30:55.492 -->

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.517\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.205\nwe are continuing on with our\nAccess 2016 Essentials show.\n\n5\n00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:26.372\nAnd this is a part two of creating\nqueries to test our design that.\n\n6\n00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:29.139\nMan, I did it again, the database design.\n\n7\n00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:31.191\nI keep forgetting\ndatabase design in there.\n\n8\n00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:35.171\nAll right, so anyway, [LAUGH] here to\nhelp us along again is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:36.530\nSo glad to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.177\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Vonne, for\nhaving me back here at Office Pro, as\n\n11\n00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:44.757\nwe continue on our part two on being able\nto test our database design using queries.\n\n12\n00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:48.060\nNow in our first part, previous episode,\n\n13\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.659\nwe did take a look at creating queries but\nusing the wizard.\n\n14\n00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.375\nRemember that the wizard is actually very\nhelpful when you start to learn how to\n\n15\n00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.910\nactually create them.\n\n16\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.000\nAccess gives you some way to do it,\n\n17\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.455\nwithout you ever having\nto learn anything else.\n\n18\n00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:06.400\nSo, it's really simply you picking\nout the fields that you want to, and\n\n19\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.790\nit shows us the results.\n\n20\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.940\nNow, remember that a part of that,\nof course,\n\n21\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.890\nis just verifying that if you can get\nthe data that you're expecting to see,\n\n22\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020\nthen your design may already be on the\nright track, which is what we want, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.500\nBut that doesn't really show you how\nto actually create a query manually.\n\n24\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.250\nAnd that's what we're hoping to do is to\ntake this part of, or this particular part\n\n25\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.130\nof this little miniseries inside\nof our Access essentials here.\n\n26\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.720\nTo show you how to do it manually as well.\n\n27\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.490\nAnd we'll show you a couple of\ndifferent techniques to help us out.\n\n28\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.427\n&gt;&gt; I like that, miniseries.\n\n29\n00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:40.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.400\n&gt;&gt; That's essentially what we're doing.\n\n31\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We have a couple parts to this.\n\n32\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n33\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.358\n&gt;&gt; And so if you're looking like, how?\n\n34\n00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:47.650\nThat is a miniseries.\n\n35\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.200\nI like that.\n\n36\n00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.570\nSo we're continuing on with part two.\n\n37\n00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.346\nI wanna start talking in some British\nvoice of some [LAUGH] PBS movie series for\n\n38\n00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:55.060\nsome reason.\n\n39\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, as long as you\ncan actually do a British accent,\n\n40\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.735\nI don't mind at all.\n\n41\n00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:00.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I cannot.\n\n42\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.065\nYeah, I cannot do a British accent.\n\n43\n00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:04.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'd just slide into Southern very\n\n44\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.280\nquickly and then people get\nentirely confused at that point.\n\n45\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.064\nSo, I'm just gonna stick with my accent,\nis what I'm gonna stick with here, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:16.097\nSo, we are just gonna pick on\ntaking a look at Design View, and\n\n47\n00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:19.761\ncreating kinda the same exact\nqueries that we just did.\n\n48\n00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.570\nAnd the reason why is that I want\nyou to see that you can manually\n\n49\n00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.362\ncreate those types of queries as well.\n\n50\n00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:28.156\nAnd to make sure that you understand\nwhat is happening manually.\n\n51\n00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:31.717\nBut we're also gonna throw in\na little extra surprise at the end,\n\n52\n00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:35.430\nwhich of course is to actually show\nyou a little bit of SQL to do this.\n\n53\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.545\n&gt;&gt; Oo,\na little plot series in our miniseries?\n\n54\n00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:39.025\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, just a little bit.\n\n55\n00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.323\nNow I don't expect you\nto actually learn SQL.\n\n56\n00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:47.701\nBut if you are moving on to towards like,\nI really like this database stuff,\n\n57\n00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:53.430\nI think I can make a career in it, and you\ncan make a career in it, I guarantee you.\n\n58\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.425\nActually, Vonne, you and I actually had\na friend that went on to be a database\n\n59\n00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:59.838\ncreator and\nanalyst at an insurance company.\n\n60\n00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:01.034\nKale O'Quinn.\n\n61\n00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he actually did that and\n\n62\n00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:07.389\nwe were all teaching Access together and\nhe just said, I'm gonna do this.\n\n63\n00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.612\nAnd he just took off,\nand that's what he did.\n\n64\n00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he hooked on and\njust went for it, and he totally did.\n\n65\n00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.023\nHe went on and\nmade a whole career out of it.\n\n66\n00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:14.677\nYou can do it, too.\n\n67\n00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:15.981\n&gt;&gt; A whole career out of Access databases.\n\n68\n00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:16.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing.\n\n69\n00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:19.570\nYeah, so it can be done.\n\n70\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.422\nBut if you really want to do that, that\nmeans you're gonna take a little bit more\n\n71\n00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:27.117\ntime, and you are gonna end up learning\nthat SQL, is what you're gonna do.\n\n72\n00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:29.579\nBut for us,\nwe're simply running the testing.\n\n73\n00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.457\nAnd the great thing is now with\nthe Design View [INAUDIBLE],\n\n74\n00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:35.688\nonce we run this for testing and\neverything tests out correctly,\n\n75\n00:03:35.688 --> 00:03:38.057\nright, you're gonna\nlearn a little bit more.\n\n76\n00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:41.110\nYou're gonna actually gonna understand\nthe foundation and the basics of it.\n\n77\n00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.910\nThis is what's gonna help you when\nyou actually start to do this for\n\n78\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.100\ncreating your reports\nin the future as well.\n\n79\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.900\nSo the skills that we're learning just\nreally around the idea of testing and\n\n80\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.370\nmaking sure everything works\nwill end up working for\n\n81\n00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.710\nus in our production,\nwhen we get our database up and\n\n82\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.940\nrunning to retrieve the records\nthat we want to retrieve.\n\n83\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.080\nWe're still working with select queries,\nbut\n\n84\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.380\nnow we're moving on to the Design View.\n\n85\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd this view is a little bit\ndifferent than what we're used to\n\n86\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.060\nseeing inside of Access.\n\n87\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.600\nA little bit, but not much, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.575\nAnd you'll see it's a combination of\na couple things that's gonna happen.\n\n89\n00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:17.692\nSo let's take a look at my machine\nhere where I have Access open.\n\n90\n00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:21.080\nWe've created these other queries\nin the previous episode here.\n\n91\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.420\nAnd we're gonna kind of make sure\nthat we create the same ones.\n\n92\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.360\nI kept them here to remind me what I\nactually did, cuz if not I'd be going,\n\n93\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.990\nokay, Vonne, what fields did I actually?\n\n94\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.340\nI don't even remember what\nfields I actually chose.\n\n95\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.850\nBut this way, the reason why we\nwanna do this also, Vonne, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.970\nAnd this is something I wanna\nmake sure I throw out there.\n\n97\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.770\nHow do I know that I'm actually\ngetting the same exact results?\n\n98\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.430\nWell, if I can run it in query, and then\nI can create my own manual one, right?\n\n99\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.830\nI can bring them both up\nto show that they're what?\n\n100\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.150\nThey're identical, and that shows me what?\n\n101\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.540\nThat, hey, it is working.\n\n102\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.970\nIt is working the way that\nAccess says it's working.\n\n103\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.510\nSo it does help me out here to\ndo what I actually need to do.\n\n104\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.959\nSo that's why we wanted\nto do that as well.\n\n105\n00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:05.903\nAll right, so now when we go to\ncreate queries, we open up Access.\n\n106\n00:05:05.903 --> 00:05:08.183\nWe click on the Create tab,\nwe look for, oops,\n\n107\n00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.170\nI'm gonna hit the wrong button\ntrying to zoom in there.\n\n108\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.331\nWe look for the Queries grouping, and\nthis time instead of the Query Wizard,\n\n109\n00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.775\nwe are going to select the Design,\ninstead.\n\n110\n00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:22.774\nQuery design, it says, creates a new,\nblank query in Design view, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:22.774 --> 00:05:26.650\nThen, you can use the Show Table\ndialog box to add in what you need to.\n\n112\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.240\nSo, once I select this,\nhere's what automatically,\n\n113\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.800\nactually, shows up at the beginning,\nhere, which is the Show Table.\n\n114\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.420\nNow, let's make sure that we kinda\nnavigate and explore this just a little.\n\n115\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.610\nIt's not too much, okay?\n\n116\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.090\nBut just so that we can see a few things.\n\n117\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.480\nThe first time that I did this,\nthough, Vonne, is kinda weird, but\n\n118\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.030\nI was like, I can't see all\nthe stuff that's behind here.\n\n119\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.560\nWhen it was way back in Access 2002 or\nwhatever it was even before that.\n\n120\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.270\nI closed out of it and\n\n121\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.640\nthen I couldn't actually find,\nall right, how do I get that back?\n\n122\n00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.430\nWell, now in Access,\nit's actually relatively easy.\n\n123\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.220\nIt used to just be a link and\na menu, right?\n\n124\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.890\nAnd then you had to find\nwhere that actually was and\n\n125\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.548\nit was a little bit harder\nto actually make it show up.\n\n126\n00:06:08.548 --> 00:06:13.300\nIf I right-click, though, I have this\nability to actually do the Show Table here\n\n127\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.270\nor I can also do the Show Table right\nhere and that will bring it back.\n\n128\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.150\nBut let's close out of that for right now.\n\n129\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.560\nAnd this window, Vonne, if you\nremember from our previous shows and\n\n130\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.960\ndesign, it really does look like\nthe relationship window, right?\n\n131\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.380\nThat's exactly what it looks like, but\ndown here at the bottom, though, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.880\nNotice that we have this all other kind\nof weird looking grid or table view.\n\n133\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.270\nBoth these are what works together for\nAccess to do we need to, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.522\nSo, you can see where it says field and\nthe table, we can do some sorting options.\n\n135\n00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:46.549\nWe can even show or\n\n136\n00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:50.530\nwe can actually uncheck it to make\nsure it doesn't show up in a query.\n\n137\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.526\nWe can set some criteria,\nin other words, filtering,\n\n138\n00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:56.540\nlike we were talking about previously.\n\n139\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.290\nAll this can be done, and\nwe're not limited by the number of fields.\n\n140\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.150\nYou can see the scroll bar, and\nI can continue if I actually have enough,\n\n141\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.100\nI can scroll all the way over.\n\n142\n00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.570\nAnd it actually allows me to put as many\nfields in there as I have tables that\n\n143\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.350\nneed all the fields that\nI want to put in here\n\n144\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.290\nto generate the record set that I need,\nokay?\n\n145\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.692\nSo from this particular point,\nwhen we start to run a query then, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:21.692 --> 00:07:26.271\nI wanna verify that I have selected,\nI know that's weird, but clicked on,\n\n147\n00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.217\nwhatever we wanna call it here.\n\n148\n00:07:28.217 --> 00:07:31.814\nAnd then I need to bring\nthat Show Table back up.\n\n149\n00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:33.860\nSo, I'm gonna select Show Table.\n\n150\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.310\nOnce I select Show Table, notice that\nit gives me a couple of options, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.038\nNow, the two options here, and\n\n152\n00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:46.435\nthis actually good too cause we\ndid save some queries, right?\n\n153\n00:07:46.435 --> 00:07:51.271\nNotice that I can actually query\nanother query, okay, if I want to, and\n\n154\n00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:53.589\nI can query table from this, too.\n\n155\n00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:55.322\nI can have that combination\nwhere I do that.\n\n156\n00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:57.848\nIn ours, it's not gonna make\nmuch sense for us to do this.\n\n157\n00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:02.488\nBut we can actually query from a query\nif we wanted to, as well as tables.\n\n158\n00:08:02.488 --> 00:08:06.900\nWe're gonna stick to tables at\nthis point to help us out, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.010\nNow the first thing that\nwe did in the previous one,\n\n160\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.150\nright, was actually say that\nwe wanted the Customers table.\n\n161\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.630\nSo I'm gonna select Customers here, then\nI can click on the Add button down below.\n\n162\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.450\nNow if I don't want to do that,\n\n163\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.620\nI can simply double-click on the Customers\nand that will make it show up.\n\n164\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.150\nYou only want it to show up one time,\nthough.\n\n165\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.850\nNotice if I double-click again, it will\nactually allow me to make multiples here.\n\n166\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.030\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of those if you were\nadding that second table you're like\n\n167\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.499\nit didn't work, and you double-click,\n\n168\n00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:41.490\nand you double-click, and\nyou double-click, and you kept on going.\n\n169\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.145\nAnd then now you have 15.\n\n170\n00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:43.672\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n171\n00:08:43.672 --> 00:08:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Instances of the same table.\n\n172\n00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.420\nSo this is where you showing,\none don't do that.\n\n173\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.274\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And for two, if I did, oops,\n\n174\n00:08:50.274 --> 00:08:52.430\nwe can come in here and remove it.\n\n175\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, at the very top of\nthis second table where it says, and\n\n176\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.470\nit actually does list it underscore\none and it'll go through the numbers.\n\n177\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.004\nThat would generate here.\n\n178\n00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:04.039\nYou just right-click, and\nyou go to Remove Table, and\n\n179\n00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:05.304\nthat will make it back down to one.\n\n180\n00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:09.218\n&gt;&gt; And this is only in the query, it's\nnot removing the table from the database,\n\n181\n00:09:09.218 --> 00:09:12.680\njust in case if you were like wait,\nam I supposed to remove the table?\n\n182\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.700\nThis is just us kind of building,\n\n183\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.980\ncuz we're in design view of building\nthe query structure, if you wanna say.\n\n184\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.330\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne, you make a really good\npoint here, okay, is to try to and\n\n185\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.770\nremember that this really has nothing\nto do with the design view itself.\n\n186\n00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.330\nSo anything that we remove in here,\nanything that we change in here\n\n187\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.990\nis not gonna change the actual table or\nstructures that exist inside of Access.\n\n188\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.770\nThis is only for\n\n189\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.860\nthe query, queries are generated at\nthe time that they're needed and what they\n\n190\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.700\ndisplay is really in RAM until we actually\ndecide we're going to save it as a query.\n\n191\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.600\nAnd it's not actually saving the results.\n\n192\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.510\nIt's only saving that query\nis what it's going to do.\n\n193\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.262\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:09:52.262 --> 00:09:53.625\n&gt;&gt; I kind of liked that\nstatement that you just made.\n\n195\n00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:54.182\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n196\n00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:56.400\n&gt;&gt; It's not saving the results.\n\n197\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.081\nIt's saving the question\nthat we're asking.\n\n198\n00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:02.500\nSorry, that was another like.\n\n199\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; That was a lightbulb for\n\n200\n00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:04.198\nme right there [LAUGH].\n\n201\n00:10:04.198 --> 00:10:07.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, that's fine,\nyeah, so here it is.\n\n202\n00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.120\nSo I want to actually go ahead and\nnow with the single one, I wanna run that\n\n203\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.130\nsame query where we actually run it and\npull all of those fields into this table.\n\n204\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.038\nI've got two ways I can do this.\n\n205\n00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:23.850\nLets kind of do it the hard way then we'll\nshow that the easy way is actually easier,\n\n206\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.350\nwhich make sense, okay?\n\n207\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.794\nSo actually,\nlet me tell you the easy way, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The easy way is right here.\n\n209\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.150\nNotice it says, there's a star,\nthere's an asterisk right here.\n\n210\n00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.556\nIf I simply click on that and\nI pull this down here,\n\n211\n00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:40.000\nthat's gonna add all the fields\ninto that grid, okay?\n\n212\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.151\nIt's not gonna look like it but it is.\n\n213\n00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:42.580\nLets gonna add all the fields in that.\n\n214\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.330\nBut what's the fun in that, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.990\nSo if we wanted to,\nwe can simply do this, okay?\n\n216\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.920\nIf I'm picking and choosing the fields\nthat I want to, I can click and\n\n217\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.040\nI can drag down into that first one.\n\n218\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.750\nAnd notice that I'd simply selected the\nfield up here in the table, right here.\n\n219\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.402\nAnd I drag down into the field\ndown here in this query grid.\n\n220\n00:11:03.402 --> 00:11:06.320\n&gt;&gt; That was a single click, drag and drop.\n\n221\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.040\n&gt;&gt; And you want to confirm that\nit is the correct table name.\n\n222\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.880\nI know that it does sound weird, but\n\n223\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.590\nmake sure that it does match up to\nwhat you believe it's gonna be.\n\n224\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.760\nThe other way that we can do this is by\ndouble-clicking on the actual field itself\n\n225\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.460\nand notice that added\nthat in here as well.\n\n226\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.460\nSo it just depends on the way\nthat you like doing this.\n\n227\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.033\nNow, if you're in a hurry,\nwhich is what I normally am,\n\n228\n00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:32.421\nis I just simply select each of those.\n\n229\n00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:32.990\n&gt;&gt; By double-clicking.\n\n230\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.805\n&gt;&gt; Yep, by double-clicking.\n\n231\n00:11:33.805 --> 00:11:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's, that's a little easier.\n\n232\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.512\n&gt;&gt; And so now I just have to verify\nthat I'm not doing, well, there we go.\n\n233\n00:11:38.512 --> 00:11:44.970\nCity, state, zip, and\nthen phone, and email.\n\n234\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.960\nOkay, so that adds it in there on that\nsingle table and you can now see all of\n\n235\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.800\nthose particular fields are added in and\nthere's even room for more if I wanted to.\n\n236\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.830\nBut for right now,\nlet's just do this one, okay.\n\n237\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.900\nNow, when I select something like that,\nokay.\n\n238\n00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.440\nI'm ready to go, well, if that's\nall that I'm really wanting to do,\n\n239\n00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.690\nI wanna verify that this is working.\n\n240\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:13.140\nI have now manually added in the table\ninto the query design up here, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.620\nAnd then I added in each of the fields\ninto this query grid as well.\n\n242\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.750\nThe neat thing about this, right, if I run\nit, it's gonna show me that same result\n\n243\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.530\nthat I had before when I walked through\nthe actual wizard, which is great.\n\n244\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.820\nBut the other thing that design\nallows me to do on the fly,\n\n245\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:35.200\nwhich the wizard doesn't allow me to do,\nis to modify it easily.\n\n246\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.910\nNow if I run this inside of the wizard,\nit's essentially gonna say hey,\n\n247\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.130\nif you wanna modify it,\nyou have to go to the Design view anyways.\n\n248\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.750\nSo whether you run the wizard, or\nwhether you're doing a Design view,\n\n249\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.110\nif you wanna modify this,\nthis is where you go to do this.\n\n250\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:54.350\nSo let's say that I didn't wanna show up\nthe loyalty ID or the customer address,\n\n251\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.020\nstate, zip and phone number here.\n\n252\n00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.270\nBut just the customer and\ntheir email address and\n\n253\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.480\nthe first name, last name, and ID.\n\n254\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.860\nWell, I can simply uncheck\nthose boxes that I just did,\n\n255\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.320\nthose one under each of these fields here.\n\n256\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.289\nI just unchecked the ones I didn't want.\n\n257\n00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:15.600\nFrom this point, I select Run.\n\n258\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.640\nAnd now notice,\n\n259\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.570\nwe're using the filters like what Vonne\nwas talking about inside of Excel.\n\n260\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.400\nTo just really help me to eliminate\nthat if I choose to do so, okay.\n\n261\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.390\nSo it does give me the results that\nI'm looking to be able to have, and\n\n262\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.800\nhopefully this is showing me that hey,\n\n263\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.060\nI am now successfully creating\na query using the design query view.\n\n264\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.016\n&gt;&gt; And I don't wanna get too far ahead but\nback in that design,\n\n265\n00:13:40.016 --> 00:13:41.861\nsay we wanted to sort it by last name.\n\n266\n00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:43.605\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because right now I can see that it's\n\n267\n00:13:43.605 --> 00:13:45.320\nnot really sorted that way.\n\n268\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.329\nCould we do it right from here within\nthe little drop down I'm seeing,\n\n269\n00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:49.353\nkind of in an Excel way?\n\n270\n00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:51.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n271\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.100\n&gt;&gt; So we could just go ahead and\nsort it from right here.\n\n272\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.620\nWe don't necessarily have to\ngo back to the design view,\n\n273\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.870\nbut if we wanted to, we could.\n\n274\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.136\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can actually\nadd in the sort there, but\n\n275\n00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:07.240\nthis id probably the easier way\nbecause you can see the data.\n\n276\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.830\nAnd notice you still have those same\noptions that you would inside Excel.\n\n277\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.930\nYou can do of course, ascending sort or\ndescending sort here.\n\n278\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.771\nSo if I select ascending, notice that\neverything changes and it matches up,\n\n279\n00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:24.160\nand now by last name,\nwe can of course, sort that as well.\n\n280\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.710\nThat gives us that ability to\nbe able to do that on the fly.\n\n281\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.020\n&gt;&gt; Just another question here.\n\n282\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.350\nThis is where you'd probably\nwanna do this in query.\n\n283\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.700\nYou don´t always really want\nto go to the tables and\n\n284\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.436\nstart doing all this stuff-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n285\n00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:38.769\n&gt;&gt; Because this is where\nI wanna pull this up now.\n\n286\n00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:42.286\nI wanna sort by last name and\nthen filter out,\n\n287\n00:14:42.286 --> 00:14:45.536\nI only wanna see anybody in Gainesville.\n\n288\n00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:47.195\nYou want to do that in the query,\n\n289\n00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:49.220\ndon´t touch the tables-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.730\n&gt;&gt; Do the queries, get the information and\nthen you can kind of do some modification.\n\n291\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.849\nBecause like you said, it´s a copy and\nit's temporary in a sense.\n\n292\n00:14:56.849 --> 00:14:58.077\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we could always run it again\n\n293\n00:14:58.077 --> 00:14:58.930\nand do some stuff.\n\n294\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, it really is neat that\nwhen you start to take a look at this,\n\n295\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.290\nthat's what you're doing, right?\n\n296\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.830\nYour queries are essentially gonna\ngenerate what you're real hoping see and\n\n297\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.650\nyou're not really gonna disturb\nthe data that's in the background.\n\n298\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.215\n&gt;&gt; Cuz my Excel brain is wanting\nto go into the worksheets.\n\n299\n00:15:14.215 --> 00:15:16.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And those are the tables and\n\n300\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.290\nI wanna start, no, don't touch those.\n\n301\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.540\nYou wanna keep those they way they are.\n\n302\n00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.180\nRun a query, do some queries,\nbecause if it doesn't work,\n\n303\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.230\nbecause you just delete the query or\n\n304\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.640\njust not even save this and then move on,\nso that's what we really want.\n\n305\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so it really does\nhelp us out in that way, right?\n\n306\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.720\nSo there's the single table and\nthat way you just know and\n\n307\n00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.350\nnow you're a little bit more familiar with\nworking in this query view here, okay.\n\n308\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.140\nSo that will work for us as well, okay.\n\n309\n00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.514\nNow, I wanna show you one other view.\n\n310\n00:15:49.514 --> 00:15:51.527\nWhat is the result of this thing.\n\n311\n00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:55.458\nWell, we saw in the data sheet view by\nsimply clicking right here as well.\n\n312\n00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:59.201\nSo when I selected Run it automatically\nchanges to this data sheet view.\n\n313\n00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:01.300\nSo that's what we get as a result.\n\n314\n00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.480\nBut notice if I click on this drop-down,\n\n315\n00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.190\nI actually have another view\nright here called SQL View.\n\n316\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.490\nSo if I select that one,\nhere's what actually would be saved\n\n317\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.180\nright here in terms of the way\nthat it's actually done, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.130\nSo at this point, notice how it\nactually lists out every single one,\n\n319\n00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.710\nand if I could actually go ahead, and\nwhich I can't, if I could actually have\n\n320\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.400\ngiven this a bigger font so we could\ntake a look at this, I would do that.\n\n321\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.090\nBut here's the basic statement from\nevery single select query that you run.\n\n322\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.890\nYou have to select the names\nof the fields, and\n\n323\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.710\nthen you tell it what table\nyou're selecting from, okay?\n\n324\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:45.310\nSo, this is what is really being\nsaved when we do the save as, and\n\n325\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.100\nwe do the QRY, and we say that this is\nwhat's being saved in the background,\n\n326\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.330\nand then, when we run it again,\nthis is what's actually being run.\n\n327\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.360\n&gt;&gt; And in this level right here,\nthat's actually,\n\n328\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.050\nI feel like I can kind of read that.\n\n329\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.006\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're saying select the field, and\n\n330\n00:16:58.006 --> 00:17:01.440\nthen it says like TBLcustomers.customerID,\nso that's like, okay.\n\n331\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.250\nThe customerID is the field,\ncuz we know that, and then that's a table.\n\n332\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So select these fields.\n\n333\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:06.720\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n334\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.940\n&gt;&gt; From, and it looks like those\nare kind of keywords if we\n\n335\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.691\nwanna say,\n&gt;&gt; Right, they are.\n\n336\n00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:12.876\n&gt;&gt; Like within the SQL language.\n\n337\n00:17:12.876 --> 00:17:14.616\nAnd those are in uppercase letters, so\n\n338\n00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:17.250\nthat's just kinda giving\nyou that indication.\n\n339\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.799\nThat actually is readable right now.\n\n340\n00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:19.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's\n\n341\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.440\nrelatively readable, isn't it?\n\n342\n00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.090\nAnd they do it in such\na formalized fashion.\n\n343\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:28.035\nWe could actually leave off the tbl\ncustomers up here if we needed to and\n\n344\n00:17:28.035 --> 00:17:31.340\nwe'll show you that a little bit later,\nI'm trying to not jump ahead here but\n\n345\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.760\nI wanted to show you the result.\n\n346\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.075\nSo when people say, hey, what's actually\nbeing saved when you're saving a query?\n\n347\n00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:41.500\nIt really is this line that's being saved,\nso you're not really saving a whole table.\n\n348\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.610\nYou're not saving the entire record set.\n\n349\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.590\nYou're saving that\nparticular query statement,\n\n350\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.400\nwhich is now microscopic on the screen.\n\n351\n00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.560\nSo, that's what you're actually saving.\n\n352\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.170\nSo, when we generate this,\nright, inside of Access, okay?\n\n353\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.770\nUsing that query grid,\nit's building this in the background.\n\n354\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.792\nThat's what it's actually building.\n\n355\n00:18:00.792 --> 00:18:03.460\nFor most of us, though,\nthat's all that we'll really need.\n\n356\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.150\nMost of us are never gonna have to\nneed to learn how to do all this but\n\n357\n00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.330\nthis simple query is something that\nwe're actually going to run again,\n\n358\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:14.720\nwe'll do it with another table here, but\nwe'll definitely be able to do this again.\n\n359\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.065\nAll right, I'm not gonna worry about\nsaving cuz we already have a copy of it\n\n360\n00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:20.770\nover here as well, so\nI'm gonna close out of this.\n\n361\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.720\nAnd then don't worry\nabout saving that design.\n\n362\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.660\n&gt;&gt; Cuz right,\nit was just a generic in RAM,\n\n363\n00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.870\na temporary query one\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n364\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.340\n&gt;&gt; But if you wanted to keep it,\nthen that's what we did the last time.\n\n365\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And well we actually\n\n366\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.080\ndid it through the wizard.\n\n367\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.790\n&gt;&gt; We did it through the wizard.\n\n368\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.200\n&gt;&gt; So that's where it kind of\nprompted us to save it at the end.\n\n369\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.725\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n370\n00:18:35.725 --> 00:18:39.960\n&gt;&gt; In design view, we'd have to do\nthat extra step, if you want to save.\n\n371\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.200\nGo ahead, and save this.\n\n372\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.880\nAnd it prompts you all over the place.\n\n373\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.412\n&gt;&gt; Right, crazy. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; If you're\ntrying to close, I forgot to save,\n\n374\n00:18:46.412 --> 00:18:48.584\nyou made one change, okay yes,\ngo ahead and save this.\n\n375\n00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:49.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n376\n00:18:49.437 --> 00:18:50.310\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty good about warning you.\n\n377\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.947\nThere's a lot of them.\n\n378\n00:18:50.947 --> 00:18:51.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\n\n379\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.640\nbecause in those, there's a lot of work\nthat is done to generate this stuff, so\n\n380\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.980\nit will help us out.\n\n381\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:02.140\nAll right, so now let's recreate the other\nquery and then we'll also show you in SQL\n\n382\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.460\nwhy it's a big difference when you\nstart going to multiple tables as well.\n\n383\n00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.740\nSo Vonne, I'm gonna warn you right ahead,\nall of a sudden this is not gonna get as,\n\n384\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.120\nlike then we go, yeah that make sense.\n\n385\n00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.370\nOnce we get into multiple\ntables you're gonna go,\n\n386\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.040\nthat may not make as much sense\nas what I thought it did.\n\n387\n00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.845\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah I'll be there like,\nsure, whatever you say.\n\n388\n00:19:19.845 --> 00:19:21.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n389\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.940\nlet's go back to design view.\n\n390\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.410\nSo I selected the Create tab up\nhere at the top on the ribbon and\n\n391\n00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.160\nthen under the Queries group,\nI'm going to select Query Design again.\n\n392\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.210\nFrom there let's do the same one.\n\n393\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:41.200\nSo Vonne, if I remember right, there's\nactually customers, and then sales.\n\n394\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.080\nAnd in that is also the sales items and\nproducts, right?\n\n395\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.500\nSo I'm gonna click close.\n\n396\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.800\nAnd you might be wondering,\ndo I need to do all that?\n\n397\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.325\nYes.\n\n398\n00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you took the words right out of\nmy mouth, I was gonna say, last time,\n\n399\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:01.690\nin the wizard, all we said was we\nwant the customers and the products.\n\n400\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.370\nAnd we said in the background\nit's gonna know\n\n401\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.840\nthat there's a couple steps in between.\n\n402\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:12.708\nWe have to select the tables that\nconnect the customers and product.\n\n403\n00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:13.997\nThat's like, a must.\n\n404\n00:20:13.997 --> 00:20:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're gonna be\nselecting from them, right.\n\n405\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.760\nNow, the thing that I have here, and this\nis something that Access went ahead and\n\n406\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.020\ngenerated for me,\nthat I didn't see that happened.\n\n407\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.250\nUnless I did this and didn't realize.\n\n408\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.110\nActually, this is something I did\nend up generating at the end.\n\n409\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.970\nNotice that it created this extra link\nhere, in between sales and products.\n\n410\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:38.800\nSo it's saying I could've actually\nleft this out if I wanted to, okay?\n\n411\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.310\nBut I really don't want\nthe link to go directly here.\n\n412\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:48.680\nSo if I don't want that, I can do\na delete on this item right here, okay?\n\n413\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.120\nSo that was something that\nAccess generated even designs.\n\n414\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.740\nI see a direct link here.\n\n415\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.140\nWhy are you actually linking\nit the way that you have it?\n\n416\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.880\nLet me link it this way instead.\n\n417\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.990\nSo you can actually choose to leave it or\n\n418\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.480\nyou can actually choose to link\nit the way that you wanted.\n\n419\n00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.612\nBecause I'm testing for\nmy design, Vonne, okay?\n\n420\n00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:09.460\nThe way that I linked them,\nI wanted to use my links, okay?\n\n421\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.192\nI am not saying that Access can't\nfigure out a way around them, okay?\n\n422\n00:21:13.192 --> 00:21:15.940\nDesign view proves that\nAccess can figure out its way\n\n423\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.560\naround anything that it wants to.\n\n424\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.600\nBut because I am testing for design,\nthese are the manual links that I created.\n\n425\n00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.290\nAnd that's what I wanna test for.\n\n426\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.695\n&gt;&gt; So\ncuz it found store number in the sales,\n\n427\n00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:29.910\nit found store number in the product.\n\n428\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n429\n00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.800\n&gt;&gt; And it create, that's actually\nsomething to be very aware of to be like,\n\n430\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.560\nokay.\n\n431\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.240\nCuz you don't wanna start relying on\nthat because if you're relying on that,\n\n432\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.070\nthen it might be that you actually\ndidn't make the connection right.\n\n433\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n434\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that, and that was indicated\nby, was it a different colored line, or?\n\n435\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.054\n&gt;&gt; It was just a line without\nany referential integrity.\n\n436\n00:21:53.054 --> 00:21:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n437\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.570\nThen the ones in the domain, okay, gotcha.\n\n438\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.130\nAnd we know we didn't do it.\n\n439\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no, we know we didn't do it.\n\n440\n00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So remember that, yeah,\n\n441\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.930\nif I go look,\nI just want the query to work.\n\n442\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.610\nI ignore it, I just go,\nokay, sure, let's do it.\n\n443\n00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.664\nBut if you get unusual results from that,\n\n444\n00:22:08.664 --> 00:22:10.960\nlike you're not expecting\nto see something.\n\n445\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.120\nThat might actually tell you like, hey,\n\n446\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.450\nthis particular link is working in a way\nthat I'm not expecting it to work.\n\n447\n00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:22.700\nSo because I'm actually doing this query\nfor what, for testing my design, right.\n\n448\n00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.360\nMy linking here.\n\n449\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.070\nI wanna see if the links that I\nactually made work or not, okay?\n\n450\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.560\nSo if I don't make it work,\nwell, I know that.\n\n451\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.790\nAnd I know Access can figure out a way,\nbut I want to understand it so\n\n452\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.670\nI'm gonna manually do this.\n\n453\n00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.320\nSo here, the first one that we did\nI think was selected CustomerID.\n\n454\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.890\nAnd first and\nlast name if I remember correctly.\n\n455\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:48.660\nI also selected the sales ID just because\nI wanna pull out some information here\n\n456\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.530\nfrom that sales ID.\n\n457\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:56.275\nWe're gonna come all the way over here to\nthe right-hand side, and select ItemName.\n\n458\n00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:57.587\nAnd, Vonne, I don't remember.\n\n459\n00:22:57.587 --> 00:22:58.945\n&gt;&gt; Think it was the manufacturer.\n\n460\n00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:01.590\n&gt;&gt; I selected Manufacturer, okay, as well.\n\n461\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.050\nSo all of that,\nif we're using my links and\n\n462\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.115\nnot the ones that Access\ngenerate to make it work, and\n\n463\n00:23:09.115 --> 00:23:14.310\nwe're use it mine, the way that I have it\nset up, I should be able to run this and\n\n464\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.440\nget the results, the same results\nthat we had before, as well.\n\n465\n00:23:18.928 --> 00:23:23.570\nSo I look down here at the bottom where\nI made an emphasis in another episode,\n\n466\n00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:29.050\n136 records, I should be able to match\nthem up and compare them and see did what\n\n467\n00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.215\nAccess do, in the way that it generated\nfor the queries that I wanted to.\n\n468\n00:23:33.215 --> 00:23:36.460\nDid it match up in the way that I\ngenerate, If they actually do match up,\n\n469\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.560\nthen I know something is right.\n\n470\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.320\nIf they don't match up,\n\n471\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.140\nI now have got to decide is it because\nAccess fixed something that I broke or\n\n472\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.680\nis Access showing something\nthat I don't want it to show?\n\n473\n00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.822\nSo you have to go back and try and\nfigure some of that out sometimes.\n\n474\n00:23:49.822 --> 00:23:54.094\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do think that we didn't have\nthe sales ID only because we only,\n\n475\n00:23:54.094 --> 00:23:59.031\nin the wizard we can only select for those\ntwo tables and not the in between tables.\n\n476\n00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:00.703\nSo I think we did the-\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n477\n00:24:00.703 --> 00:24:04.773\nAnd the products, we did the product ID or\nsomething like that.\n\n478\n00:24:04.773 --> 00:24:09.500\nCuz those were the only two\ntables that we could choose from.\n\n479\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did remind it.\n\n480\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.230\nSo actually that brings us to a good\npoint, let's go back to design view and\n\n481\n00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.740\nfix that.\n\n482\n00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.430\nSo if we end having like a field\nthat I didn't want to see,\n\n483\n00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.320\nall I have to do is select that.\n\n484\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.320\nSo, the way we select that I know it's\nkinda hard to see here, let me zoom in.\n\n485\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.230\nYou have to kinda get on\nthis little grey bar,\n\n486\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:30.200\nsee your cursor turn into that down arrow,\nselect it.\n\n487\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.670\nThen, I should be able to,oops,\nI thought I'd be able to,oh,\n\n488\n00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.650\nit's probably because it's a link now.\n\n489\n00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.240\nI should be able to simply remove it here.\n\n490\n00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.944\nCome on,\nI'm gonna cut it that'll work instead.\n\n491\n00:24:42.944 --> 00:24:46.570\nAll right, run it [LAUGH] here and\nnow there we go,\n\n492\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.790\nI have the Customer ID and then all\nthe information from the products as well.\n\n493\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.110\nSo, I know something at this point,\n\n494\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.980\nwe're able to correct it just\na little bit in terms of the query.\n\n495\n00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.020\nWe also of course are seeing the\ninformation that we're expecting to see.\n\n496\n00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.700\nAnd I'm still got 136 records, which means\n\n497\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.190\nthat everything is actually reight at\nleast from the way that we see it.\n\n498\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:13.130\nNow Vonne,\nI wanna show you here in the View,\n\n499\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.920\nthen I'm gonna select SQL View here and\nnow, Vonne,\n\n500\n00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:23.080\nlet's see I can zoom in a little\nbit to us a little bit more room.\n\n501\n00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.990\nYou can see why this get's\ncomplicated very quickly here.\n\n502\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.954\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI'm starting to see more words in capital\n\n503\n00:25:28.954 --> 00:25:29.520\nletters\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n504\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm also seeing some brackets and\n\n505\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.430\nsquigglies and squirrelly brackets\nas I call them sometimes.\n\n506\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.125\nIt's like, okay, yeah,\nI'll let you do this Access.\n\n507\n00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:41.738\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n508\n00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:47.325\nthat's why sometimes Access will, but\nhere you're actually seeing the key here.\n\n509\n00:25:47.325 --> 00:25:50.582\nWhen we actually start doing\nqueries against multiple tables,\n\n510\n00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:54.320\nwe're gonna actually be creating\nsomething that we call joins.\n\n511\n00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.385\nNow, in Access Essentials, we're not\ngetting into joins and all that stuff.\n\n512\n00:25:58.385 --> 00:26:03.090\nAs we go into Access Advanced,\nwe'll see that we can manipulate these\n\n513\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.830\njoins to be what we call inner joins and\nouter joins.\n\n514\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.370\nAnd notice this, not only did\nwe do an inner join up here, but\n\n515\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:14.680\nnotice inside we also did another inner\njoin as well between these two tables.\n\n516\n00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.830\nSo you're doing an inner join, and\n\n517\n00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.110\ninside of that inner join\nthere's another inner join.\n\n518\n00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.450\nSo that's why this may be a little\nbit more intimidating and\n\n519\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.485\nyou can even see out here again,\nanother inner join.\n\n520\n00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:25.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n521\n00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.426\nthese are nested if statements that\ncan go super, super deep in Excel.\n\n522\n00:26:29.426 --> 00:26:34.541\nBut in the sense of a join I can\nthink of just, in the terminology,\n\n523\n00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:40.493\nwe are joining two tables, if that's\nwhat they're calling it here in SQL.\n\n524\n00:26:40.493 --> 00:26:42.753\nSo I get the concept.\n\n525\n00:26:42.753 --> 00:26:45.784\nHow to write it in that\nparticular language,\n\n526\n00:26:45.784 --> 00:26:48.520\nno not yet, but, I see the concept.\n\n527\n00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it becomes a little\nbit more challenging is\n\n528\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.440\nwhat ends up happening here.\n\n529\n00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.710\nSo, most of us are probably\nnever going to actually\n\n530\n00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.370\ndo that unless you really are starting\nto get into that place where you go hey,\n\n531\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.330\nI really want to actually learn\nhow to do something like this.\n\n532\n00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.920\nSo the great thing is Vonne, so\nfar, we've tested everything out.\n\n533\n00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.744\nNot only did we allow Access to say,\nhey let me,\n\n534\n00:27:10.744 --> 00:27:14.979\nI know that you created a relationship\nRonnie but let me just go ahead and\n\n535\n00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:17.816\nrun these queries and\nmake sure that they work.\n\n536\n00:27:17.816 --> 00:27:21.650\nAnd if they don't, I'll correct it for\nyou and don't worry about it.\n\n537\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:27.080\nThen we came to Design View here and\nwe showed you where we can actually make\n\n538\n00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.290\nthose queries work manually\nby using that query grid and\n\n539\n00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:35.480\nadding in of course the tables into\nthat query design window up at the top.\n\n540\n00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.390\nShow you the relationships that were there\nand even deleted one, which was great.\n\n541\n00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.199\nNow the last thing I want\nto do is show you you can\n\n542\n00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:45.603\nactually create one of these\nreally from scratch here.\n\n543\n00:27:45.603 --> 00:27:48.584\nLet me not change there.\n\n544\n00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:53.183\nI will go ahead and create, and this time\nI have to go to Design View instead.\n\n545\n00:27:53.183 --> 00:27:58.770\nHere I am just gonna run a simple\none by using SQL View instead.\n\n546\n00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.930\nNow I am gonna zoom in so\nthat we can see this a little bit more.\n\n547\n00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.800\nIf I could change the font, Vonne,\nI would, but I can't change the font so\n\n548\n00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.050\nthis is what happens here.\n\n549\n00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.197\nSo we're just going to\ndo another one here and\n\n550\n00:28:11.197 --> 00:28:13.582\nI got to make sure I get\nthe table name right Vonne.\n\n551\n00:28:13.582 --> 00:28:20.140\nSo let's do it for the product table,\nit's already up there.\n\n552\n00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.550\nSo if I wanted to I actually just want\nto do a simple query for everything.\n\n553\n00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.690\nSo remember I told you that in\nthe Design View, we simply,\n\n554\n00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.480\nactually, need to select all of them.\n\n555\n00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.690\nI'm not going to type them all in,\n\n556\n00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:36.090\nI'm just going to use the asterisk as\na wildcard, say, show me all the tables.\n\n557\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.470\nNow, once we have that,\nI just simply go to the second line, and\n\n558\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.930\nmy other key word right here\nis actually gonna be from and\n\n559\n00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.930\nthen I have to remember how I\nactually named this tblProducts.\n\n560\n00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.330\n&gt;&gt; And that we're actually\ndoing the select of the fields?\n\n561\n00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Selecting all the fields from\n\n562\n00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.240\nthis table?\n\n563\n00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah, that is simple enough\neven Ronnie Wong can actually run that,\n\n564\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.160\nat least I hope I can.\n\n565\n00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.680\nAnd then I simply select Run.\n\n566\n00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.031\n&gt;&gt; Yay [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n567\n00:29:05.031 --> 00:29:07.050\nSo it's very easy.\n\n568\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.060\nNow that's just the simplest\nselect statement.\n\n569\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.560\nWhen I used to teach the SQL, the\nTransact SQL, we always began with that,\n\n570\n00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.620\ncuz I wanted people to actually\nsee the data was in it.\n\n571\n00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.020\nAnd this is something that's\nvery good at the beginning,\n\n572\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.290\nis that you actually take a look\nat the data that you have.\n\n573\n00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.170\nAnd especially,\neven if it's only five or six rows,\n\n574\n00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.400\nmake sure you understand that data.\n\n575\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.090\nAnd when you query it,\nwhat it's actually showing you.\n\n576\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.940\nSo this will actually work for\nus right now.\n\n577\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.890\nSo Vonne, it looks like we're well on our\nway to actually having a good design.\n\n578\n00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.580\nBut so far though Vonne, I've only really\ntested out part of our design here.\n\n579\n00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.848\nSo let's go back and\nsee just briefly here.\n\n580\n00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:47.590\nWe've really only tested\njust a few things over here.\n\n581\n00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.670\nUp here at the top, we didn't even test\nthis particular connection out yet.\n\n582\n00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.670\nBut over here though,\nI still have the employees table,\n\n583\n00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.140\nI still have the stores table over here,\nI'm gonna test it out.\n\n584\n00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.430\nSo I'm not really complete\nwith my testing, okay?\n\n585\n00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.350\nSo we ran out of time as well.\n\n586\n00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.300\nSo at this point Vonne,\nwe are ready to move on and\n\n587\n00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.920\nwe're about to see something\nthat we haven't seen before yet.\n\n588\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.553\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie this sounds just like\na mini series in the sense that we've got\n\n589\n00:30:12.553 --> 00:30:13.800\nsome foreshadowing coming on.\n\n590\n00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.778\nThere's some lurking evil on the horizons\nthat's gonna show us where we\n\n591\n00:30:18.778 --> 00:30:20.256\nmade some mistakes.\n\n592\n00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:24.438\nWe made some mistakes in some of\nthe design and even some data entry.\n\n593\n00:30:24.438 --> 00:30:26.290\nYes, me right here.\n\n594\n00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.232\nI handed in some data wrong.\n\n595\n00:30:28.232 --> 00:30:31.480\nBut that's where we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this episode.\n\n596\n00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.680\nAnd signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n597\n00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n598\n00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.662\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n599\n00:30:36.662 --> 00:30:46.400\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] Vonne, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.861\nI am doing fine as we continue on here at\nOffice Pro, to take a look at more Access.\n\n14\n00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:56.280\nAnd of course, still testing out our\ndatabase designed by using queries.\n\n15\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.763\nSo remember that in previous episodes,\nlet's take a look at my screen,\n\n16\n00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:05.469\nwe went ahead and we took a look at\nthe relationships and we started testing.\n\n17\n00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.315\nWe went ahead and did a test on just\na customer's table that we could verify,\n\n18\n00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:10.467\nwe could pull that in.\n\n19\n00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:12.502\nWe also did it with a products table.\n\n20\n00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:17.732\nThen we ran a multiple table kind of\nquery, right between customers and\n\n21\n00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:21.141\nproducts and\npulled all that information in.\n\n22\n00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:23.295\nShowed you how we can do\nit in Design View as well.\n\n23\n00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:27.040\nAnd that tested those\nrelationships just fine.\n\n24\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.990\nBut I did leave three tables out.\n\n25\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.210\nThe stores table, the employee's table,\nas well as the customer's pets table.\n\n26\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.270\nAll of those will also need some testing\ntoo, so that's where we want to begin.\n\n27\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.760\nNow you might be wondering\nlike why did you just\n\n28\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760\nnot do all of that at one\ntime if you could do this?\n\n29\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.350\nWell, we wanted to kind of set this up in\nwhat Vonne actually led to at the end of\n\n30\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.150\na previous episode here, that there\nare sometimes there's gonna be dark,\n\n31\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.130\ntreacherous things that end up happening.\n\n32\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.550\nAnd they can be confusing,\nthey can be head scratching,\n\n33\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.420\nthey can cause you some frustrations,\nwe didn't wanna leave that out.\n\n34\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.540\nIt's easy to make everything\nperfect before the shows happen and\n\n35\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.830\nthen to not show you like here's\nwhat you're gonna run in to.\n\n36\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.870\nBut if you're at the Essential's level, if\nyou are right here and you go this is my\n\n37\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.940\nfirst database, I ran into so many\nmore issues than what you showed here.\n\n38\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.260\nWell, we don't wanna leave you out on that\ncuz we also did the same thing as well.\n\n39\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.440\nSo we are about to show you, at least\nright now, as we continue testing,\n\n40\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.592\nthis is where we found out that our\nperfect design was not so perfect.\n\n41\n00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.033\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is what it came down to.\n\n42\n00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.475\n&gt;&gt; This first one that we're doing to do,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:41.085\nthis is almost like a mini series with\nlike this as the treacherous part.\n\n44\n00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:44.325\nIt's also like the behind the scenes\nwhere the actors tell you like\n\n45\n00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:47.325\nwhat they're feeling in\nthis part of the episode.\n\n46\n00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:51.338\nAnd, I'll tell you right here\nthat I was feeling, not so smart.\n\n47\n00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:56.979\n[LAUGH] This was my favorite type\nof error, this is a PEBKAC error,\n\n48\n00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:01.816\nthis is the problem exists\nbetween computer and chair.\n\n49\n00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.635\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right here.\n\n50\n00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:06.320\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at it.\n\n51\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.040\nWe're gonna set the scene, right?\n\n52\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.990\nWe're gonna go ahead and run the query and\nthen show you something's wrong.\n\n53\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.805\nAnd then maybe we'll see if you can figure\nout what it is before we even tell you.\n\n54\n00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:17.893\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n55\n00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:19.980\nhere's where we began to run into issues.\n\n56\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.920\nRemember that one of those tables\nthat we did is that we said hey,\n\n57\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.110\nwe want to run the customers and\nthe customer pets.\n\n58\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.730\nSo logically for us, when we did this we\nselected the customers, we said first and\n\n59\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.830\nlast name and we wanted the actual\npet's name or dog's name to come in.\n\n60\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we just wanna list the names\n\n61\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.190\nof the customers in our loyalty\nprogram and then their pets.\n\n62\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.800\nSimple.\n\n63\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.900\nSeems simple, right?\n\n64\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.928\nThat has a connection between\nthe loyalty ID, right?\n\n65\n00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:47.676\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nboth tables had that loyalty ID in it and\n\n66\n00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:51.030\nthat did seem to work out\nthe way that we wanted to.\n\n67\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.690\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n68\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.700\nLet's go ahead and run this and\nthere it is Vonne, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.189\nSo there's the results that I got.\n\n70\n00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.297\nNow the weird thing is I know if I\nlook at the customers table I know I\n\n71\n00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:05.012\nhave customers in the customer's table.\n\n72\n00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:10.125\nIf I take a look in the customer\npet's table, here I have 33 pets in\n\n73\n00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:15.266\nthis one I think I have about 36\ncustomers, in the other one here.\n\n74\n00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:20.360\nSo I know that when I run a query,\nI should get some result.\n\n75\n00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Right and let's go look at\nthat customers table again.\n\n76\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.580\nSo let's actually bring in\nboth up to do a little kind of\n\n77\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.160\nplay on here to see if they could\nstart seeing what's going on here.\n\n78\n00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.780\nSo we have here, we have our customers,\nand I can see, we have a first name,\n\n79\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.810\nlast name, we have an address,\nwe have a customer ID.\n\n80\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.250\nWe said that those were a primary key,\nright?\n\n81\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.220\nAnd then, we have a loyalty ID.\n\n82\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.340\nSo we went ahead, and\nthat's their loyalty ID.\n\n83\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.104\nAnd so, that was the thing that we said,\neven though we were doing a foreign key to\n\n84\n00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:50.484\nforeign key for\nthis particular table, the customers.\n\n85\n00:04:50.484 --> 00:04:53.680\nNow let's jump over to the customer pets.\n\n86\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.410\nOkay, well there's\nthe loyalty ID there too.\n\n87\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.120\nSo it's like okay, what's going on here?\n\n88\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.260\nSo let's just have some fun with y'all.\n\n89\n00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.760\nLet's look,\nlet's switch over to the customer tables.\n\n90\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.010\nLoyalty ID, okay, pets, do you see it?\n\n91\n00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.130\nI see it now,\nbecause I had to figure it out.\n\n92\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940\nWhat's wrong with the Loyalty IDs?\n\n93\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.920\n&gt;&gt; As we start to take a look at this,\nthis is something that does happen.\n\n94\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.473\nWhereas you're creating these tables,\nand now you're entering in dummy data.\n\n95\n00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:28.564\nYou're probably trying to do\nit as quickly as you can,\n\n96\n00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:30.630\nthat's what it comes down to in reality.\n\n97\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.233\nAnd so you enter in all the data for\none table, then you switch on over and\n\n98\n00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.400\nyou enter all the data for the other table\nnow that you've got those fields set up.\n\n99\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.326\nAnd you think that you're entering\nthem all consistently, and\n\n100\n00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:45.470\nthat's what we've found\nout here's something.\n\n101\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.837\nIs that these are not consistent\nfields in these tables.\n\n102\n00:05:48.837 --> 00:05:52.593\n&gt;&gt; And this is something that\nI did all the back in Excel,\n\n103\n00:05:52.593 --> 00:05:58.458\nlike when I was testing it out, cuz he's\nlike build the concepts of your database.\n\n104\n00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:03.809\nAnd I'm like yeah, and\nthis is gonna be the Loyalty ID,\n\n105\n00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:10.160\nyeah, notice this is 1, but\nthe other Loyalty ID is L001.\n\n106\n00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.130\nSo this is a little bit\nof a self-formatting.\n\n107\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.068\nI think I just did\nan auto-generated number,\n\n108\n00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:21.060\nlike 1 then copy down fill series in one\nand then I was getting creative, and\n\n109\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.920\nwe'll put an L001 for Loyalty ID so\nit changes, I know this is right here.\n\n110\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.585\nBecause I said, Pet ID?\n\n111\n00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:31.577\nWell I wanted the Pet ID and\nthe Loyalty ID-\n\n112\n00:06:31.577 --> 00:06:32.098\n&gt;&gt; To match?\n\n113\n00:06:32.098 --> 00:06:36.800\n&gt;&gt; To be different, well, to\ndifferentiate a different numbering here.\n\n114\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.700\nSo that's why I said P for\npet and L for loyalty.\n\n115\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.410\nI remember this is the first one I did.\n\n116\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.041\nI'm like yes cuz I wanted to\nhave fun in making up dog names.\n\n117\n00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:50.024\n[LAUGH] But then when I over to\nthe customers then I was like Loyalty ID,\n\n118\n00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:53.470\nI just know it's like 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, or whatever.\n\n119\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.140\nSo I didn't match up the data itself.\n\n120\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.540\nFields were right,\nthe relationship that we made was right.\n\n121\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.110\nIt was me that put the data in wrong,\nso this is mismatched data.\n\n122\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.555\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, you said that you had\nfun making up pet names here.\n\n123\n00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:13.391\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n124\n00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:18.674\nI did see something here that I'm\nreally not sure how you look at me now.\n\n125\n00:07:18.674 --> 00:07:20.101\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well as you can see,\n\n126\n00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.802\ntowards the bottom,\nI started running out of creativity, so\n\n127\n00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:25.620\nI looked around the room.\n\n128\n00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.600\nI see Ronnie, I see Wes, and I see Daniel.\n\n129\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.408\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n130\n00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:31.105\n&gt;&gt; So that was who was in\nthe office with me at the time.\n\n131\n00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:34.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so, what do we have to do?\n\n132\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.770\nWell we have to get a match.\n\n133\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.230\nOne way or the other, right?\n\n134\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.940\nSo it doesn't matter which way you pick,\nit's just one way or the other.\n\n135\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.118\nSo as long as you pick one and\nyou're consistent that's the key.\n\n136\n00:07:45.118 --> 00:07:48.834\nNow that means that we\nhave to go back once we\n\n137\n00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:53.289\nfix all of this data in\nthe original tables itself.\n\n138\n00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.928\nIt also means that we have to go back and\n\n139\n00:07:55.928 --> 00:08:01.460\npossibly change data types If that one\nwas actually considered a number or not.\n\n140\n00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.170\nSo, let me go back to the design view\nhere, and that's of course right okay.\n\n141\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.850\nYou can't do that line or\nanything else is open.\n\n142\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.530\nSo let me close out of this query.\n\n143\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.491\nI saved it, so that we could do this.\n\n144\n00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:13.726\nThere we go, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:16.115\nSo here it is on the loyalty ID.\n\n146\n00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:18.840\nNotice that there's a short\ntext which is fine.\n\n147\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.150\nIf I go to the customer pets, and\nI select this as well, a short text.\n\n148\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.750\nThe great thing is I don't have to\nmess around with the data type, but\n\n149\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.110\nyou do have to consider this if you\nactually start it off that way.\n\n150\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.010\nMake sure you go ahead and make those\nconsistent at the beginning too.\n\n151\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is actually,\n\n152\n00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:37.192\nwe're throwing in another\none that we realized here.\n\n153\n00:08:37.192 --> 00:08:39.230\nAnd I think it's the customer one, right?\n\n154\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.738\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because at first,\nthe customer ID was a short text, correct?\n\n156\n00:08:46.738 --> 00:08:48.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I think that's when we imported it,\n\n157\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.880\nwe just said, yeah, we'll just keep it\nas short text, that's totally fine.\n\n158\n00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.440\nBut then this is something\nthat you discovered.\n\n159\n00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.982\nThat really should be a number.\n\n160\n00:08:56.982 --> 00:08:59.620\nSo do you maybe wanna elaborate\non that and where we had it.\n\n161\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.396\nIt's not just here, is it?\n\n162\n00:09:00.396 --> 00:09:05.019\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so when I started doing\nthis especially with a customer ID and\n\n163\n00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:09.933\nthe short text and then I got everything\nto work, I realized how the numbers ended\n\n164\n00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:14.245\nup looking and how they started to\nkind of sort themselves out as text.\n\n165\n00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:17.679\nWhen you have a single digit then\nyou go to two digits, right,\n\n166\n00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.855\nit doesn't actually count as 1, 2,\n3, 4 and list it all the way down.\n\n167\n00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:23.304\nIt actually counts all the ones.\n\n168\n00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:26.908\nSo it went from 1 to 10, 11, 12, 13.\n\n169\n00:09:26.908 --> 00:09:32.437\nAnd then it had a 2,\nthen it went to 20, 21, 22.\n\n170\n00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:35.270\nI started doing that, I was like,\nI really didn't want it to do that.\n\n171\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.082\nNow not that it really matter\nin the database itself,\n\n172\n00:09:38.082 --> 00:09:39.531\nas far as storing the data.\n\n173\n00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:44.228\nIt really doesn't matter at all, but\nI thought at least for the sake of the way\n\n174\n00:09:44.228 --> 00:09:48.276\nthat I wanted to actually see the data\nwhen it was reported out, and\n\n175\n00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:50.490\nI could sort the data, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.750\nThen I decided to change also\nthe customer ID up here to a number type.\n\n177\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.400\nSo where we actually had another customer\nnumber, which was in the Sales table,\n\n178\n00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.040\nI went ahead and change that one,\nas well, to that too.\n\n179\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.493\nSo notice that the customer ID here\nis also a number type as well.\n\n180\n00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:08.835\n&gt;&gt; But originally-\n&gt;&gt; With short text.\n\n181\n00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:12.345\n&gt;&gt; You would had in that particular table,\nyou had to make sure,\n\n182\n00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.380\nit's one of those, if it's here.\n\n183\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.070\nJust like with the loyalty,\nthe l001, that's the data itself.\n\n184\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.570\nThis is, you're talking about,\nthe data type of the field.\n\n185\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.080\nIf it's number one place,\nand short text in another,\n\n186\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.759\nthen that's where we would\nstill have some issues here.\n\n187\n00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:34.574\nSo it's kind of the same\nidea of the mix matching but\n\n188\n00:10:34.574 --> 00:10:39.250\njust at the different levels,\nthe data or the data type.\n\n189\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.627\nAnd so we had to make sure that we went\nback and changed them, everywhere.\n\n190\n00:10:42.627 --> 00:10:47.117\nBut also, just to make sure, we talked\nabout when we went back and changed this,\n\n191\n00:10:47.117 --> 00:10:51.147\nthere was another key thing that we\nneeded to do before you start changing\n\n192\n00:10:51.147 --> 00:10:54.020\nthe information was turn\noff the relationship.\n\n193\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.721\nUnconnect them, basically.\n\n194\n00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, especially if you have\nreferential integrity turned on, and\n\n195\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.240\nyou go and start to change stuff and\nfields, it say whoa, whoa, whoa,\n\n196\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.251\nwait a minute, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:03.251 --> 00:11:06.532\nIf you're changing in here,\nI want to change it in the other one, and\n\n198\n00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:10.690\nthen it goes, I'm not finding that match,\nor I'm not doing what it needs to.\n\n199\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.110\nSo it might prevent you from doing that.\n\n200\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.200\nIf you know that you can change it,\nall you have to do, or at least what I\n\n201\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.940\nthink is at least good practice, is to\nsimply disconnect these relationships.\n\n202\n00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.310\nThe great thing is with dummy data,\n\n203\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.060\nit's not going to hurt anything\nas long as you're not updating.\n\n204\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.140\nSo it's just saying, hey, are you sure\nthat you want to permanently do this?\n\n205\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.540\nSo I'm just going to disconnect\nthat table completely\n\n206\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.260\ncuz I just don't want to mess\naround with it right now.\n\n207\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.704\nSo once I do this, then I can go back and\n\n208\n00:11:38.704 --> 00:11:43.130\nmake sure that hopefully\neverything's saved.\n\n209\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.840\nSometimes I forget that it\nnormally asks me to save stuff.\n\n210\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.352\nBut yeah, so\nthat actually did close up fine.\n\n211\n00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:52.210\n&gt;&gt; I think if we wanted to close\nthe access all together then it would\n\n212\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.930\nprompt us.\n\n213\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.510\nCuz right now you're still just working,\nso there's not like I have to save to get\n\n214\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.895\nyou into the next place in access, at\nleast that's what I've been experiencing.\n\n215\n00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:02.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n216\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.760\nthis is where we have\nto make a decision on.\n\n217\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.019\nOkay, we had to make a decision on\nthe loyalty ID, whether we wanna keep this\n\n218\n00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:12.763\nnumber or whether we're gonna\nkeep the one with the L00, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:12.763 --> 00:12:18.085\nSo as long as you pick one or\nthe other, that's kinda the key here.\n\n220\n00:12:18.085 --> 00:12:22.705\nBut Vonne made a good point about making\nsure that we didn't kinda confuse them\n\n221\n00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:25.635\nif they ended up showing\nup together like this.\n\n222\n00:12:25.635 --> 00:12:28.805\nOkay, so this one can get a little bit\nconfusing and your minds can start to\n\n223\n00:12:28.805 --> 00:12:32.220\nkind of, you can see where it\ncan get a little bit cross eyed.\n\n224\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.107\nCustomer ID, is that a one, or\nare we talking about the loyalty ID one.\n\n225\n00:12:36.107 --> 00:12:38.460\nSo that's why we wanna do this.\n\n226\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.340\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe can even take it one step further.\n\n227\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.134\nThis is more of like a,\njust to be completely consistent, but\n\n228\n00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:44.334\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n229\n00:12:44.334 --> 00:12:45.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n230\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.579\n&gt;&gt; Like that pet ID, I did P 001.\n\n231\n00:12:47.579 --> 00:12:51.372\nHere with customer ID,\nyou might want to do C 001.\n\n232\n00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:56.403\nBut again, that's more of an internal,\nhow you are going to recognize it.\n\n233\n00:12:56.403 --> 00:12:59.396\nCuz we could keep them all as\njust straight numbers, but\n\n234\n00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:01.887\nyou'd get a couple fields\nthat have numbers.\n\n235\n00:13:01.887 --> 00:13:06.256\nAnd then how is this different than\nquantities, just straight quantities?\n\n236\n00:13:06.256 --> 00:13:11.240\nTry in giving yourself your own\nkind of internal naming convention\n\n237\n00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.260\nof something that does just have a number.\n\n238\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.789\nIt might make it a little easier.\n\n239\n00:13:16.789 --> 00:13:18.450\nAnd yes, we did decide.\n\n240\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.980\nAnd we're not gonna show you to\nchange the actual data in here,\n\n241\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.850\nwe're just kinda giving you the ideas.\n\n242\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.210\nBut the break in the relationships first,\nand then going back.\n\n243\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.638\nAnd just another question on that data\ntype with the changing it to number.\n\n244\n00:13:30.638 --> 00:13:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n245\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.236\n&gt;&gt; All the information was there.\n\n246\n00:13:33.236 --> 00:13:35.728\nBut as long,\nyou took off the relationships and\n\n247\n00:13:35.728 --> 00:13:38.420\nthen just went to the data type and\nmade it a number.\n\n248\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.168\nIt's fine now,\nchange it to all the other ones.\n\n249\n00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:46.960\nIt's not like I had to re-enter it in now,\nokay.\n\n250\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.093\nSo we're all right with that.\n\n251\n00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:51.270\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and then all you have to do\nat that point is connect them back.\n\n252\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.580\nMake sure if you had referential\nintegrity turned on, turn that back on.\n\n253\n00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.232\nAnd you are now ready to go.\n\n254\n00:13:56.232 --> 00:14:00.858\n&gt;&gt; And but if you had any\nalpha characters, like an A or\n\n255\n00:14:00.858 --> 00:14:04.740\nlike that P 001 that can not be a number.\n\n256\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.342\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; That would have to be short text.\n\n257\n00:14:06.342 --> 00:14:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; So if you're thinking like that's\n\n258\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.711\nthe naming convention that we're gonna\ngo ahead and go with in our internal\n\n259\n00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:17.272\norganization, then that kind of determines\nit for you, it has to be short text.\n\n260\n00:14:17.272 --> 00:14:20.140\nAnd that's where if it's numbers,\nit's numbers.\n\n261\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, so here's what we did.\n\n262\n00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.430\nWe went ahead and we corrected it, and\n\n263\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.150\nwe actually saved it into another database\ncuz we wanna show you the correction,\n\n264\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.230\nbut it would have taken so long for\nyou to actually figure that out.\n\n265\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.210\nSo here's what we wanted to show you,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.090\nSo at the end,\nif I go back to customer pets,\n\n267\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.420\nwe do have that loyalty ID of L00,\nwhich is fine.\n\n268\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.490\nAnd now notice that in the customers\ntable, we did the same thing.\n\n269\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.291\n&gt;&gt; And sorry to cut you off there Ronnie,\nbut just kind of reiterate that,\n\n270\n00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:53.025\nif you look at the title bar in our files,\nthis one is named dogs fixed.\n\n271\n00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:57.925\nAnd the other one is underscore data\nissues, so those are the two file names.\n\n272\n00:14:57.925 --> 00:15:01.612\nAnd if you're following them up we do have\nthose exercise files available for you,\n\n273\n00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:04.692\nso just if you're like\nwhich file are we on.\n\n274\n00:15:04.692 --> 00:15:07.534\nFix this fix, issues is the wrong one.\n\n275\n00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:10.812\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this way it's fixed at this point,\n\n276\n00:15:10.812 --> 00:15:16.172\nand let's verify cuz I never remember\nif we connected everything back here.\n\n277\n00:15:16.172 --> 00:15:17.858\nSo if I go back to relationships,\n\n278\n00:15:17.858 --> 00:15:22.070\nhere's where we also went ahead and\nconnected these things back together.\n\n279\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.209\nSo we are ready to go.\n\n280\n00:15:23.209 --> 00:15:27.057\nOkay, so at this point it's\nsimply testing out whether or\n\n281\n00:15:27.057 --> 00:15:29.891\nnot that particular query is going to run.\n\n282\n00:15:29.891 --> 00:15:34.726\nSo if I select the customer pets query,\nnotice this time it actually ran and\n\n283\n00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.426\ngave us what we wanted to.\n\n284\n00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:41.188\nLoyalty ID shows up and this time we even\nadded in pet ID when we did this as well,\n\n285\n00:15:41.188 --> 00:15:42.790\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n286\n00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.300\nAnd there is the name of the dogs.\n\n287\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's the same set up that we\ndid when we went in to design view said\n\n288\n00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.685\nthese are the two tables and went ahead.\n\n289\n00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:53.672\nSo this is just showing you it\nworked because we fixed the data.\n\n290\n00:15:53.672 --> 00:15:54.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n291\n00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:58.681\nit's really important that we do this\nbecause this is what will get you\n\n292\n00:15:58.681 --> 00:16:02.882\na better understanding Of how\nthose relationships are working.\n\n293\n00:16:02.882 --> 00:16:06.590\nYou might hear people say you don't\nhave to worry about unlinking them.\n\n294\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.700\nBut you will find, especially those errors\nthat, to me, they scare me to death.\n\n295\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.380\nEspecially when they say if you don't\ndo this you're gonna lose data.\n\n296\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.810\nI would rather lose the data in one table\nthan to actually accidentally delete\n\n297\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.720\na record and it cascades everything and\nmake that fail as well.\n\n298\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.930\nSo instead I always unlink them, and\n\n299\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.920\nthen I put them back in place once I\nmake the corrections that I need to.\n\n300\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.975\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome, and just a little\nforeshadowing, since we're doing our\n\n301\n00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:38.210\nmini-series and now we're gonna leave you\na little cliffhanger for new episodes.\n\n302\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.320\nJust to look at this particular result\nof the query, if you don't mind.\n\n303\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.920\nWe have, if you look at that\nfirst one we have Michelle West.\n\n304\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.565\nAnd Michelle West is listed three times,\nwhy is that?\n\n305\n00:16:47.565 --> 00:16:50.190\nWell because Michelle has three dogs.\n\n306\n00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.090\nShe has Maxine, Cheddar, and Unit.\n\n307\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Unit.\n\n308\n00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.760\n&gt;&gt; How did I choose that?\n\n309\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.420\nI also did some auto name generating.\n\n310\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.630\nThere's some websites where you're like,\n\n311\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.820\nyou can actually do like\ndog name generators.\n\n312\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.960\nSo I had some fun with that one too.\n\n313\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But anyways,\n\n314\n00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.950\nthat's where it's like well\nmaybe we wouldn't wanna\n\n315\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.930\nhave Michelle show up three times.\n\n316\n00:17:08.932 --> 00:17:12.562\n&gt;&gt; Kisses\n&gt;&gt; Kisses yeah.\n\n317\n00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:13.577\n&gt;&gt; That poor dog\n&gt;&gt; I'm so\n\n318\n00:17:13.577 --> 00:17:14.457\nglad you're getting joy out of this.\n\n319\n00:17:14.457 --> 00:17:18.718\nBut back to the point, Michelle,\nwe don't want it to show three times\n\n320\n00:17:18.718 --> 00:17:23.676\nIs this where we can get into, I think\nyou said something about reports, right?\n\n321\n00:17:23.676 --> 00:17:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To where we could summarize Michelle,\n\n322\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.110\nand then the three dog names.\n\n323\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.880\nSo if any of you are looking at that, and\n\n324\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.689\nlike why did it come up three times, well\ncuz that's what we asked the query to do.\n\n325\n00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We wanted it to do that.\n\n326\n00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.030\nBut when you want it to\ndisplay even prettier,\n\n327\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.220\nif you wanted to say, that's where we\nget into reports, so foreshadowing.\n\n328\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:50.930\nLook for that episode coming soon to\na TV screen or computer screen near you.\n\n329\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.570\n&gt;&gt; The reality is, that's right, most\npeople are confused the first time that\n\n330\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.750\nthey run a query and\nthey're saying is this right?\n\n331\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:02.300\nWell, it's right as long as each of\nthese rows is unique in some way, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.860\nSo notice that the first\nthree columns are not unique.\n\n333\n00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.878\nBut notice that pet id and\ndog name, at least for\n\n334\n00:18:08.878 --> 00:18:13.260\nthose three, they are going to\nmake those three rows unique.\n\n335\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.280\nSo, this is displaying the data correctly.\n\n336\n00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.811\nWhat Vonne is referring to, and\n\n337\n00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:20.488\nthat's the way that we normally\nsee the data at the end.\n\n338\n00:18:20.488 --> 00:18:24.587\nAs we're saying, why didn't it just\ndisplay Michelle West's name one time and\n\n339\n00:18:24.587 --> 00:18:27.410\nthen each of the dogs you know,\nunder her name.\n\n340\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.830\nThat's because we haven't\nactually done that yet.\n\n341\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.110\nCan we do it, yes.\n\n342\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.920\nA report is how we do something like that,\nand make it work.\n\n343\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.290\nBut the data and the way that we query it,\nand the way that we pull the information\n\n344\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.600\ntogether, this is how it's actually\ngoing to be reported, at least then.\n\n345\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.310\nThen we can massage it or format it in\nthe correct way when we do reports.\n\n346\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.980\nSo that's another thing for us to actually\nthink about when we start the testing\n\n347\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.660\nhere, and\nwhat the query reveals to us, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.510\nIf I only got two out of these\nthree results and I knew\n\n349\n00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.040\nthat there were three for Michelle, then I\nwould be a little bit more worried okay?\n\n350\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.455\nBecause I've go why did it miss one\nresult, but it gave me the other two?\n\n351\n00:19:06.455 --> 00:19:07.675\nI'd have to go and check and\n\n352\n00:19:07.675 --> 00:19:11.690\nsee why that's not working the way that\nI think it's supposed to be working.\n\n353\n00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.660\nBut at least now I know that by simply\nactually matching up that data type,\n\n354\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:22.020\nnot data type itself, but by matching\nup at least the column, the information\n\n355\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.460\nhere under loyalty ID, that was actually\nwhat fixed it before when we ran this.\n\n356\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.040\nRemember we got no data.\n\n357\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.830\nThat's because when it tried to look for\nthat other one for that matching field,\n\n358\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.450\nit says I find the field over there, but\nthere's no values that match between them.\n\n359\n00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.720\nI can't return to you anything here.\n\n360\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.426\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like you're also setting\nup to where it's gonna find matching but\n\n361\n00:19:42.426 --> 00:19:46.446\nthen the data is like wait no that\nis not what is supposed to display.\n\n362\n00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:51.155\nSo it sounds like you are foreshadowing\nyou are going to get results but they\n\n363\n00:19:51.155 --> 00:19:56.030\nare wrong and then you have to go and do\nsome more hunting of why they are wrong.\n\n364\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.720\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n365\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.894\nThere are other times where you do\nactually have to do a little bit more and\n\n366\n00:19:59.894 --> 00:20:01.209\nwe'll also see that as well.\n\n367\n00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:06.063\nBut Vonne I think for this issue we have\nsolved this issue relatively quickly and\n\n368\n00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:09.978\nthis will help us to better design\nthat we thought was perfect and\n\n369\n00:20:09.978 --> 00:20:14.630\nactually make it more towards what we\nneed to be a working design as well.\n\n370\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.540\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so we started with a problem,\nwe fixed that problem.\n\n371\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.000\nForeshadowed yet another problem.\n\n372\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.760\nSo that means that we're gonna have\nto come back and show you even more.\n\n373\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.500\nSo thank you so much for that, Ronnie.\n\n374\n00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.780\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up and put it in the can.\n\n375\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.640\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n376\n00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n377\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.667\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n378\n00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:39.390\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.446\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:20.877\nwe are continuing on with our\nAccess 2016 essentials show.\n\n5\n00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:25.673\nWe are in a part four, yes,\npart four- [LAUGH] Of our mini series in\n\n6\n00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:30.036\ndoing our queries and testing for\nour databases on, I got it right, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:31.066\nThat's true.\n\n8\n00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.685\nYes, and here to help us is Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.108\nYes, I can talk today, woo-hoo!\n\n10\n00:00:35.108 --> 00:00:39.726\n[LAUGH] All right, Vonne, thank you again\nfor allowing me back for our part four.\n\n11\n00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:44.194\nWe are getting as long as some movie\nseries at this particular point, but yes,\n\n12\n00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:47.524\nit is a mini series for\nus inside of our access essentials.\n\n13\n00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:51.681\nAnd we're continuing to take a look at\nsome of the issues that we might end up\n\n14\n00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:52.611\nfacing as well.\n\n15\n00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:56.871\nAs we're starting to now create\nqueries to test our design, we've\n\n16\n00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:01.820\nseen a couple of successful examples,\nwhere the relationships did work out.\n\n17\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.559\nAnd we were able to test them, but\nwe also in a previous episode saw where\n\n18\n00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:10.202\nsimilar design wasn't working\nas well as we thought.\n\n19\n00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.540\nAnd one of those ways to\nbe able to have a tell,\n\n20\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.508\ntell sign that maybe the design\nisn't correct, right?\n\n21\n00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:18.466\nIs that we saw where it\ndidn't return to us anything.\n\n22\n00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.457\nSo even though we queried across\na couple of different tables,\n\n23\n00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.049\nwe got no results at all.\n\n24\n00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.530\nAnd we found out that it was from\nsome data entry issues we had.\n\n25\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.880\nAnd now we're gonna continue with\nthe rest of our process here, and\n\n26\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.670\ntake a look at what may actually\nbe another issue for us as well.\n\n27\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.620\nSo Vonne, we're just gonna start doing\na query on some of the other tables\n\n28\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.868\nthat we haven't done before.\n\n29\n00:01:39.868 --> 00:01:43.706\nSo Vonne, let's do an example here\nof what we might want to find out.\n\n30\n00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:48.331\nSo Vonne, let's go ahead what we\nhave left are the store table and\n\n31\n00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:50.444\nthe employees table as well.\n\n32\n00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.000\nSo let's run a query there and\nthen we'll pick up from that point, right?\n\n33\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.278\nSo when we wanna create a query, well\nremember because we're testing for design.\n\n34\n00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:03.017\nI'm just gonna click on Create,\nand then once I click on Create,\n\n35\n00:02:03.017 --> 00:02:06.559\nI'm gonna select\nthe Query Design view as well.\n\n36\n00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:11.291\nAnd then let's select employees and\nstores, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.848\nSo Vonne, I have in my mind,\nthat I want to run\n\n38\n00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:19.730\nthis query where I find out what\nemployees are in what stores.\n\n39\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.078\nOkay, that sounds like a logical and\nreasonable- Yeah.\n\n40\n00:02:22.078 --> 00:02:25.945\nQuery that we might wanna do, especially\nif we have a large amount of employees.\n\n41\n00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:26.727\nRight.\n\n42\n00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:28.526\nAnd so we wanna see where they work.\n\n43\n00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:29.065\nYeah, it is.\n\n44\n00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.060\nIt's one of those things that,\nif you know that,\n\n45\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.683\nI would definitely wanna find that out.\n\n46\n00:02:32.683 --> 00:02:34.920\nSo that actually does\nseem like a logical one.\n\n47\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.773\nSo let's go ahead and do this,\nI'm gonna select store number here.\n\n48\n00:02:38.773 --> 00:02:43.966\nAnd then I'm also going to select the,\nlet's do this,\n\n49\n00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:48.727\nselect the employee ID,\nfirst name and last name.\n\n50\n00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:54.457\nAnd because we're all\ninside of the same state,\n\n51\n00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:59.240\nI couldn't remember- [LAUGH] What I\nwas saying, we're all inside of what?\n\n52\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.556\nThe same state.\n\n53\n00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:03.775\nI'm going to select City here as well,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:07.696\nSo when we start to take a look at this,\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n55\n00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:11.063\nIs we're gonna actually pull this\nfrom that information that we see\n\n56\n00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:11.898\nright up there.\n\n57\n00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:14.664\nSo let me expand everything.\nAll of our stores are in Florida, so\n\n58\n00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:19.672\nwe couldn't go ahead and do it by Florida,\nwe had to go ahead and go with city.\n\n59\n00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:23.499\nYeah, there's no doubt that this should\nbe the query that I want to run and\n\n60\n00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.744\nit should actually end up returning here.\n\n61\n00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:28.100\nBut when we start to do this, right?\n\n62\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.294\nI'm gonna click Run,\nwe're going to see, there it is, Vonne.\n\n63\n00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:34.956\nIt looks like that I've\nsuccessfully done this.\n\n64\n00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:39.368\nAnd so now, I have those three employees\nin each of these three stores.\n\n65\n00:03:39.368 --> 00:03:40.250\nLooks good to me.\n\n66\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.970\nYeah, this is where knowing your data,\nsince I created the data.\n\n67\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.053\nAnd I was really excited to go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:50.388\nput some people's names in\ncertain stores and everything.\n\n69\n00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:54.097\nI know that there's more\nthan one employee per store.\n\n70\n00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:58.032\nAnd then this result, it's just\nsaying that you have employee here,\n\n71\n00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:00.106\none employee there, in each store.\n\n72\n00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:03.049\nThere's five employees in each store.\n\n73\n00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.813\nSo we're seeing a result, but\nit's not the right result, is it?\n\n74\n00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:12.377\nYeah, at least not in this instance\nin what we're seeing in it.\n\n75\n00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:15.578\nSo let me change this around for\na moment VOnne, and\n\n76\n00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:18.269\nwe'll see what can actually happen here.\n\n77\n00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.964\nSo let me remove the store number\nfrom the actual stores here,\n\n78\n00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:24.959\nthat I'm going to query.\n\n79\n00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:29.682\nSo let me see if I can remove it, I wanna\ncut it, that's the easiest thing I can do.\n\n80\n00:04:29.682 --> 00:04:34.305\nAnd notice that in the employee's table\nI already have a store ID down here\n\n81\n00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:35.285\nVonne, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:40.154\nSo if I select that one, and\nI just kind of drag that over into that\n\n83\n00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:44.405\nparticular field over here and\nthen I click Run, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:44.405 --> 00:04:45.290\nNow on this one,\n\n85\n00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.775\nit's really not connecting and\nshowing me anything different.\n\n86\n00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:52.272\nBut notice that I am only pulling\nthose three records and Vonne,\n\n87\n00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:55.522\nyou said that you know that\nthere's more in the employees.\n\n88\n00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:57.818\nI should be at least seeing this many.\n\n89\n00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:00.542\nYeah, and\ndo you mind scrolling over to the right?\n\n90\n00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:04.864\nJust so we can kind of see, here we have\nthe employees, we have the first name,\n\n91\n00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:08.096\nlast name, and\nthere is a store ID right there Right.\n\n92\n00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:13.220\nSo when here, and this is kind of\nlike two pronged in a sense- Right.\n\n93\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.885\nNow, one, the query is not giving\nus the results that we know\n\n94\n00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.185\nare in here based on our data.\n\n95\n00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:21.992\nSo something's wrong with our query.\n\n96\n00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:22.826\nRight.\n\n97\n00:05:22.826 --> 00:05:25.265\nWell, actually it's not\nnecessarily the query's wrong.\n\n98\n00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:28.552\nSomehow the relationships or\nsomething's going wrong here.\n\n99\n00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:31.460\nAnd then the other thing I have\nas a question almost is like,\n\n100\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.800\nwell you have a store\nnumber here in this table.\n\n101\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.508\nCouldn't we just go ahead and\nquery this particular table, and just say,\n\n102\n00:05:38.508 --> 00:05:43.077\nokay, well just go ahead and give me\nwhat employees work in what stores.\n\n103\n00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:45.448\nSure.\nI mean that could be- Yeah,\n\n104\n00:05:45.448 --> 00:05:46.108\nlet's try that.\n\n105\n00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:46.883\n[CROSSTALK] Right?\n\n106\n00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:50.724\nSeems to be a good idea,\nso let me pull the actual,\n\n107\n00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:56.216\nlet's delete out anything that's\nregarding the stores table at all.\n\n108\n00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:58.304\nSo let me go ahead and\ncut that one out, and\n\n109\n00:05:58.304 --> 00:06:00.530\nnow we've got just about everything here.\n\n110\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.647\nAnd I click Run, and Vonne look.\n\n111\n00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:06.939\nIt's still not showing up what\nI'm expecting it to show up.\n\n112\n00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.799\nI should see at least those number of\nrecords divided up the way that we saw\n\n113\n00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:12.013\na little bit earlier.\n\n114\n00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:15.362\nSo I do have some issue that's\nhappening here that we need to address.\n\n115\n00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:17.544\nOkay, so this query right here,\nwe took out the stores.\n\n116\n00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.795\nSo that this thing saying,\ngive me the first and last name,\n\n117\n00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:22.759\nthe store ID, and the employee ID.\n\n118\n00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.904\nSo okay, this is where it's\nnot really working either.\n\n119\n00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:28.429\nRight.\nSo we have a couple issues and\n\n120\n00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:30.154\nwe're going to address them, aren't we?\n\n121\n00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:33.470\n[LAUGH] We really are, we need to actually\nfigure out what has happened here.\n\n122\n00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.254\nSo this is that second result\nthat we were talking about,\n\n123\n00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:38.168\neven from previous episodes, right?\n\n124\n00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:41.246\nAs you're testing, and you run a query and\nyou get no results at all,\n\n125\n00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:42.798\nwell that's kind of the easy one.\n\n126\n00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.900\nYou know that there's data in the table,\n\n127\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.170\nyou know that you're not getting any\nresults and you need to return results.\n\n128\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.286\nThat let us to actually take\na look at those individual tables.\n\n129\n00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:56.933\nAnd then realize that we did have a data\nproblem where it was mismatching the data.\n\n130\n00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.654\nAnd it was never gonna find\nthe result between two of them.\n\n131\n00:06:59.654 --> 00:07:02.839\nBut now that I actually\ncome to Store Number here.\n\n132\n00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.497\nAnd I'm starting to have some issues,\nwell why is it only returning\n\n133\n00:07:06.497 --> 00:07:10.400\nto me three entries,\nregardless of which way I do this, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.310\nBut actually I have more employees\nin that, and that means there is\n\n135\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.870\nsome other issue going on and this comes\nback to how we relate to those tables.\n\n136\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.985\nSo let's take a look at that table\nrelationship for just a moment here and\n\n137\n00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.488\nthis should help us out a little bit,\nokay?\n\n138\n00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:28.998\nAnd so in this example,\nthe last example is the data was wrong or\n\n139\n00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:30.398\nthe data type possibly.\n\n140\n00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:34.949\nThis is where it's an issue with\nthe relationships between the tables.\n\n141\n00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:36.064\nRight.\nOkay.\n\n142\n00:07:36.064 --> 00:07:41.522\nYeah, this one is actually an issue with\nthe relationship in between the actual\n\n143\n00:07:41.522 --> 00:07:46.260\ntables itself, and let's see what\nactually happened here, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.958\nLet's take a look at these two\ntables are here on the right.\n\n145\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.530\nI'm trying to move\neverything out of the way.\n\n146\n00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.996\n[LAUGH] So that we're not focusing in\nto much over here, but more on that,\n\n147\n00:07:57.996 --> 00:07:58.812\nthere we go.\n\n148\n00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.661\nSo that way she helped us out, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:04.657\nSo as I take a look at\nthis relationship Vonne,\n\n150\n00:08:04.657 --> 00:08:09.575\nWhat I was trying to do was to\nmake sure that every employee\n\n151\n00:08:09.575 --> 00:08:13.930\ncould actually be assigned to every store.\n\n152\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.880\nBut notice how I have this link here where\n\n153\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.010\nwhat it's gonna show me is actually\nonly the managers in every store.\n\n154\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.820\nSo even my query for employee ID's and\n\n155\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.600\nthe store is only gonna show my\nthose that have the manager ID.\n\n156\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.240\nSo there's an issue here right away.\n\n157\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.250\nWell, the logic behind why we did that\nwas like okay, well we wanna make\n\n158\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.090\nsure we can pull the manager from\nof each store from the employees.\n\n159\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.450\nRight.\n\n160\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.700\nBecause, the manager is an employee.\n\n161\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.964\nRight.\nSo that's what the [CROSSTALK] And\n\n162\n00:08:44.964 --> 00:08:46.116\nthe ID numbers were the same, right?\n\n163\n00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:48.105\nOkay.\nYeah, so I thought that,\n\n164\n00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:51.150\nthat would work and so\nof course that would do it but\n\n165\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.063\nI forgot to actually do the other thing,\nokay.\n\n166\n00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:58.398\nWhich was to take a look at this idea\nof making sure that the employees\n\n167\n00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:02.300\nthemselves could actually\nbe matched to the store.\n\n168\n00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.700\nSo here, I don't have the proper link that\nI need to, and that's what we have to fix.\n\n169\n00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.145\nSo is that actually why\nwe resulted in only three\n\n170\n00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:13.815\npeople when we said go ahead and\ngive me all the employees.\n\n171\n00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:17.345\nBecause the connection is like well\nI'm just gonna pull the manager.\n\n172\n00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:21.085\nSo that it worked but\nnot with the logic that we wanted.\n\n173\n00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:22.035\nRight.\nSo\n\n174\n00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:27.195\nit's not incorrect, it's just we it\nseems do we need another relationship?\n\n175\n00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:28.375\nIs that what we're going with?\n\n176\n00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:30.125\nWell, we really need to\nreplace this one okay?\n\n177\n00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:30.695\nReplace it, okay.\n\n178\n00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:34.040\nBecause if we don't it might\nactually pull from one or another.\n\n179\n00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.260\nAnd we don't know exactly which\nlogic its gonna use at this point.\n\n180\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.710\nSo, what we want to do here is we want\nto change this relationship here.\n\n181\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:47.510\nSo, if I go ahead and do this, where I\nright click and I select delete here.\n\n182\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.240\nI might actually cuz I want to make sure,\nokay,\n\n183\n00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.160\nI didn't actually know I\nhad the table open here.\n\n184\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.550\nSo it's gonna go ahead and\ndelete that relationship now.\n\n185\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.850\nAnd now, I have to actually be able\nto link this some other way, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:05.580\nNow for the store ID though, okay that's\nwhat I want to link this on, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.500\nSo I want to actually say, for\nall the employees that have a store ID,\n\n188\n00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.160\nmake sure that matches up to\nthat store number instead, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:22.530\nSo, here notice that I have the products\nrelated to the store number over here.\n\n190\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.030\nAnd I really didn't need that.\n\n191\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.260\nI didn't need to actually limit myself to\nwhat products were actually in the stores.\n\n192\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.470\nI also need to get rid of\nthis relationship right here,\n\n193\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.820\ncuz that one didn't really\nmake any sense either.\n\n194\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.650\nIf I did that,\nit'd only show me the products\n\n195\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.360\nthat actually had a store number\nattached to them as well.\n\n196\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.040\nAnd that way we didn't wanna do that.\n\n197\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.830\nAnd that's kind of where we didn't\nwanna limit the products to the store,\n\n198\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.250\nthe products can go to any of the stores.\n\n199\n00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.108\nOkay, so\nthat's where we got that going on.\n\n200\n00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:53.749\nAll right, wow,\nwe got a couple issues, don't we?\n\n201\n00:10:53.749 --> 00:10:59.800\n[LAUGH] It really did, so now that we have\nthat, if I now select the store number.\n\n202\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.250\nAnd I link it over to store id,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n203\n00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.040\nenforce the referential integrity,\nand I click Create there.\n\n204\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.045\nSo Ronnie I have a question.\n\n205\n00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:11.632\nRight.\nWhen you just made that relationship you\n\n206\n00:11:11.632 --> 00:11:14.170\nhad store id and store number,\n\n207\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:20.720\nthey don't match in the sense of\nthe actual words but that's okay, yes?\n\n208\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.684\nVonne, yes, you caught me\ntrying to get one over on you.\n\n209\n00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.200\nOkay [LAUGH].\nSo let's take a look at what Vonne's\n\n210\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.700\ntalking about here.\n\n211\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.680\nNotice that I just tried to emphasize\none and not the other one here, and\n\n212\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.625\nI made the linking relationship in\nhoping Vonne wouldn't catch it.\n\n213\n00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:38.640\n[LAUGH] But she did catch it cuz she knows\nher data and that's the key here, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.610\nSo notice I do have where it\nsays store ID right here.\n\n215\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.200\nAnd then over here, it says store number.\n\n216\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.870\nWell, they're not exactly exact matches.\n\n217\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.660\nI know that's a weird kind of phrasing,\nisn't it?\n\n218\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.230\n[LAUGH] They're not, the exact matches\nthat we normally expect them to be\n\n219\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.610\nif we're gonna be creating\nthat link relationship.\n\n220\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.800\nBut the name of the actual column itself\nor the field of data does not really\n\n221\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.720\nmatter so much as long as the data\nin those fields do match up.\n\n222\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.220\nSo in this instance, yes.\n\n223\n00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.320\nIt would be better if both of\nthem were named identically\n\n224\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.830\nbecause it does help with the logic of it.\n\n225\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:19.643\nIt helps us.\n\n226\n00:12:19.643 --> 00:12:21.622\nYeah.\n[CROSSTALK] Like more than anything else,\n\n227\n00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:24.278\nit's like it's store\nnumber across the board.\n\n228\n00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:25.502\nRight.\nNot store ID,\n\n229\n00:12:25.502 --> 00:12:29.060\nit's still we know that is\nthe store that they work in.\n\n230\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.360\nThe store number is\nthe number of the store.\n\n231\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.367\nIt's all the same, Right.\n\n232\n00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:36.150\nData, but\nyou might wanna- Good name different.\n\n233\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.260\nTry to keep the headings\nof the fields- Yeah.\n\n234\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.975\nConsistent, for your own brain.\n\n235\n00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:42.780\n[LAUGH] And there's no doubt\nthe data is absolutely 100%\n\n236\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.610\nthe better way to go because people\nwill get confused about this.\n\n237\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.200\nAnd when people that are inexperienced\nwith databases get confused they start\n\n238\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.905\nchanging things.\n\n239\n00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:53.560\n[LAUGH] Well the other thing that\nwe've also been kind of using,\n\n240\n00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.610\nif you wanna talk about\nour convention- Right.\n\n241\n00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.420\nAnd how we've been naming these\nfields like the store ID.\n\n242\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.950\nOr customer ID, that's almost\nkind of like our primary key.\n\n243\n00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.160\nRight.\nIn a sense, so if you're mixing IDs\n\n244\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.980\nin with numbers and we've kind of gone\non this path of ideas that unique.\n\n245\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.120\nIt's like, we're starting to\nget a little in the woods.\n\n246\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.826\nSo, We are.\n\n247\n00:13:14.826 --> 00:13:16.012\nNot do that [LAUGH].\n\n248\n00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:20.109\nYeah, we shouldn't do that okay, but\nI wanted to show you that it can happen\n\n249\n00:13:20.109 --> 00:13:22.991\nespecially when you're in\nthe middle of the design so\n\n250\n00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:25.890\nthat might be a design issue\nthat we come back and fix.\n\n251\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.080\nDepending on who you learn how\nto create databases from, you'll\n\n252\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.340\nsee a lot more abbreviations, like number\nis typically not normally written out.\n\n253\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.200\nSo a lot of times you'll see\nsomething like abbreviations\n\n254\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.480\neven to like store number.\n\n255\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.290\nSo you might see store num or store ID, or\n\n256\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.272\nyou'll see instead of product\nnumber like what we have.\n\n257\n00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:51.610\nProd P-O-R-D-N-U-M instead\nbecause we normally used to,\n\n258\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.330\nthe way that used to be\nyou kept it eight letters.\n\n259\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.450\nThat was the maximum [CROSSTALK] Really?\n\n260\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.725\nYep.\nLike back in the day.\n\n261\n00:13:57.725 --> 00:14:01.173\n[CROSSTALK] Back in the day,\nyou are right, yeah.\n\n262\n00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:06.015\nSo that's what used to happen when, so\nif you learned from a really old guy.\n\n263\n00:14:06.015 --> 00:14:10.115\n[LAUGH] Like this guy over here then yeah,\nyou might have actually kept it that but\n\n264\n00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:13.600\nI tried to change it make it easier\nin terms of learning environment.\n\n265\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.670\nSo yes, keeping consistent is\ngonna be the key for you but\n\n266\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.670\nyou may see where someone created\nit like that or created and\n\n267\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.090\nif someone says to you\nhey I want it to be this.\n\n268\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.550\nYou can go back and ask them at this point\nbecause it is an issue if it's for you,\n\n269\n00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.928\ndo you mind if I change store\nID to store number, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:31.928 --> 00:14:35.950\nAnd they'd no, I didn't even know that it\nwas different, and that's what happens.\n\n271\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.894\nSometimes you're making it really quickly,\nyou're jotting down notes and\n\n272\n00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:41.745\nyou're not even paying attention as\nyou're typing it in and you go yes,\n\n273\n00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:42.898\nit's just a store ID number.\n\n274\n00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:46.323\nAnd then the next one you start off and\nyou go Vonne said it was store num and\n\n275\n00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:47.159\nthen you, Yeah.\n\n276\n00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:48.880\nThen you follow back into convention.\n\n277\n00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.590\nBut yes,\nI was trying to pull a fast one on Vonne.\n\n278\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.080\nI actually changed this in\nthe database as well, right?\n\n279\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.970\nSo when there's change, we went ahead and\nwe actually made a fixed database.\n\n280\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.690\nHere wanna make sure that\nthis is actually the one.\n\n281\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.560\nNope that's the one with data issues,\nso there we go.\n\n282\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.260\nOkay, so this is the one where we\nfix those issues in, so that we can\n\n283\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.424\nactually run the queries that we wanted\nto, to make sure that they work, okay.\n\n284\n00:15:13.424 --> 00:15:18.690\nSo Vonne, if we actually do the same thing\nhere and I have selected lets see store.\n\n285\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.360\nSorry to interrupt, That's fine Do you\nmind if we look at those relationships\n\n286\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.135\nreal quick to show that we've got\nthat Lets do it All right, so\n\n287\n00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:27.640\nnow I mean, I know they're all\nover the place in there, but\n\n288\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.460\nnow we have our employees and our store.\n\n289\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.210\nOkay, and if you'll are like,\nthere's some other things in there.\n\n290\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.310\nWe have other examples that we'll get to\nin our other parts of our miniseries.\n\n291\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:41.100\nBut right now, yep, that's what we've got,\nwe've got our relationship, Right.\n\n292\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.350\nThe same way in this database.\n\n293\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.470\nThis one is now actually linked here, now\nwe still have to deal with something else\n\n294\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:52.315\nthat is going to come up\na little bit later on.\n\n295\n00:15:52.315 --> 00:15:54.325\nAn example that we'll\nactually point out here.\n\n296\n00:15:54.325 --> 00:15:57.655\nBut you can see I already deleted\nout also that product number here.\n\n297\n00:15:57.655 --> 00:16:00.555\nBut let's deal with that\nin just a moment instead.\n\n298\n00:16:00.555 --> 00:16:02.548\nSo I'm gonna close out this design view,\nand\n\n299\n00:16:02.548 --> 00:16:05.266\nI'm not gonna worry about\nsaving the changes right now.\n\n300\n00:16:05.266 --> 00:16:06.913\nAnd there's a little thing that got me,\n\n301\n00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:09.635\nthat little warning that just came\nup is just changing the layout.\n\n302\n00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.910\nRight It's where you\nmove the tables around.\n\n303\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.362\nAnd I'm like wait.\n\n304\n00:16:14.362 --> 00:16:16.480\nBut did I do a different relationship?\n\n305\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.695\nIt's not talking about the relationships.\n\n306\n00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:18.742\nIt's the moving of the.\n\n307\n00:16:18.742 --> 00:16:21.860\nYeah.\nPieces around the relationship view.\n\n308\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.200\nRight.\nThat got me.\n\n309\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.290\nYeah, it will, and\nit just depends on what you need to see.\n\n310\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.180\nSo if you're actually trying\nto do this for a print out.\n\n311\n00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.108\nYou might want to try and move everything\nto where you can see the lines attached.\n\n312\n00:16:33.108 --> 00:16:33.633\nYou know?\n\n313\n00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:34.260\nMm-hm.\nAnd\n\n314\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.310\nmake sure you of course can\nsee all of your field names.\n\n315\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.410\nIf you actually want to,\nto make sure of that.\n\n316\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.280\nAnd, that way you can do\nthat relationship report.\n\n317\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.220\nAnd, it prints out and\nyou see all the lines available to you.\n\n318\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.380\nYou really don't care.\n\n319\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.080\nYou simply just close out of it.\n\n320\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.720\nAnd it says, hey, do you want\nto have Sheets save the layout?\n\n321\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.280\nYou can either say yes.\n\n322\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.960\nAnd in theory, that should bring\nit back up to what we just saw,\n\n323\n00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.200\ninstead of the way they had it all\ncrunched in before when we saved it, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.480\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate that same report again.\n\n325\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.150\nAnd this time,\nas I go back to our query design.\n\n326\n00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.760\nWe're gonna select the employees and\nthe stores here, and\n\n327\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.070\nwe're gonna try that same thing again,\nokay, Vonne?\n\n328\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:21.820\nWhere I wanna find out all of the\nemployees inside of each of the stores or\n\n329\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.890\nworking for those stores as well.\n\n330\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:24.750\nSo let's select.\n\n331\n00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.530\nWe'll do the store number first here.\n\n332\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.592\nAnd also, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n333\n00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:35.264\nLet's do employee ID,\nfirst name, and last name, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:35.264 --> 00:17:37.995\nNow, the other thing that I want here,\nright?\n\n335\n00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:43.030\nIs to say, all right, where is each store?\n\n336\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.470\nSo, I come over to the stores table,\nand select state.\n\n337\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.300\nNot state, I needed.\n\n338\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.130\nCity.\nCity, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.760\nYeah.\nNow actually this is a good point that\n\n340\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.030\nI can make right here.\n\n341\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.880\nI don't always have to get\nrid of the entire column.\n\n342\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.800\nI can also click on this dropdown and\nthen select the actual field here too.\n\n343\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.590\nThat's easy.\n\n344\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.362\nYeah.\nThat's nice.\n\n345\n00:18:01.362 --> 00:18:03.350\nThat actually makes it easy for us.\n\n346\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.670\nAnd then let's select Run,\nand there it is, okay?\n\n347\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.040\nSo now we have this ability to\nwhere I can see the store numbers.\n\n348\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.707\nAnd now notice Vonne,\n\n349\n00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:18.718\nwe did actually see 15 employees\ninstead of just the original 3.\n\n350\n00:18:18.718 --> 00:18:23.739\nIf I wanted to add in,\nlet's say the manager ID to this.\n\n351\n00:18:25.642 --> 00:18:30.750\nSo who manages each store, we can now\nalso see the manager column in here.\n\n352\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.610\nOops let me see if I can\nzoom in a little bit.\n\n353\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.490\nOkay.\nAnd so now I can see for\n\n354\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.750\nthe Gainesville store, the manager is\nDEI Tim Tebow, of course, and why not?\n\n355\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:46.940\n[LAUGH] And then in Lake Vina,\nwhich I can't say, Lake Buena Vista.\n\n356\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.250\nLake Buena Vista, we have\nElsa Arandell as the store manager.\n\n357\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:51.930\nElsa Arandell.\n\n358\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.470\nThere we go.\n\n359\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.980\nYep.\n\n360\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.730\nAnd then down here in Tampa.\n\n361\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.290\nVictor Hedman, is the store manager.\n\n362\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.140\nVictor Hedman, okay?\n\n363\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.205\nSo Vonne, because she's worked\nwith the data, she knew exactly.\n\n364\n00:19:02.205 --> 00:19:04.630\n[LAUGH] I had to kind of search for\nit here.\n\n365\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.510\nSo you can see where it's actually\ngiving us the result that we want it to.\n\n366\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:15.390\nNow Vonne, let me kind of test your\nquerying master skills at this point.\n\n367\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.950\nVonne, what if I change this city,\n\n368\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.520\nfrom the stores table over\nto the employees table?\n\n369\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.540\nOkay. Okay?\nShould I get a different result?\n\n370\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.310\nWhat do you think here?\n\n371\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.582\nI'm going to take out\nthe manager as well Yes?\n\n372\n00:19:29.582 --> 00:19:33.030\n[LAUGH] Well let's check it out, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.030\nSo, yeah.\n\n374\n00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.790\nNotice that we actually did get a few\ndifferent results over here, okay?\n\n375\n00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.928\nSo Vaughn, what do you think\nactually happened at this point?\n\n376\n00:19:40.928 --> 00:19:42.086\nOkay.\n\n377\n00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:45.103\nSo this is kind of going\nback to my question of well,\n\n378\n00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:48.340\nwhy didn't you just go ahead and\nquery the same table?\n\n379\n00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.722\nBecause you had the store number.\n\n380\n00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:50.280\nRight.\n\n381\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.164\nListed there in the employees table.\n\n382\n00:19:53.164 --> 00:19:53.675\nRight.\n\n383\n00:19:53.675 --> 00:19:56.650\nSo that should do exactly\nwhat it should do.\n\n384\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.420\nWell it is, but it's pulling out\neverything the employees and\n\n385\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.160\nthe city where they live.\n\n386\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.079\nIts not the city.\n\n387\n00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.166\nWhere the store.\nOf the store they live.\n\n388\n00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:08.140\nRight.\n\n389\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.190\nAnd that's where it's like,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n390\n00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.280\nIt's still right.\n\n391\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.981\nRight.\nI mean, the query's not broken.\n\n392\n00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:19.020\nThis is more of a the question that I or\nyou.\n\n393\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.625\nRight.\nWere asking of it and\n\n394\n00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:24.974\nmaking sure that we're getting\nthe right feel from the right table.\n\n395\n00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.842\nWhich goes back to making sure\nwe have the right connections.\n\n396\n00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:29.107\nThere you go.\nTo tables.\n\n397\n00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:30.093\nThere ya go.\nDid I get it right?\n\n398\n00:20:30.093 --> 00:20:30.640\nYeah.\nYeah.\n\n399\n00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.345\nYay.\n[LAUGH] If you remember when I did this\n\n400\n00:20:32.345 --> 00:20:33.040\nearlier, right?\n\n401\n00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.314\nAnd I tried not to do this, trying not\nto give us away the actual answers here.\n\n402\n00:20:38.314 --> 00:20:42.746\nWe did this so that you could see that\nwhichever way, once I had that link done,\n\n403\n00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:46.791\nit wasn't going to show me anything but\nthe result that I didn't want.\n\n404\n00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:50.569\n[LAUGH] So, I knew I should get different\ncities over here in the employees,\n\n405\n00:20:50.569 --> 00:20:54.250\nif I queried the employees table for\nthe city because that actually matches\n\n406\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.950\nthe employees and where they live in\nterms of their personal information.\n\n407\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.140\nBut in the stores table,\n\n408\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.040\nwhen I queried the city there,\nthat should only match whatever those are.\n\n409\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.630\nSo, as I add in that from\neach of those tables,\n\n410\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.430\nthat's what gives us\nthe different results.\n\n411\n00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.246\nThat's what proves that\nthis query is working, and\n\n412\n00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:12.624\nthat our design at this\npoint is still good.\n\n413\n00:21:12.624 --> 00:21:16.343\nYeah, this result right here, that we're\nlooking at, would be a question that says,\n\n414\n00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:18.171\nwell what cities do our employees live in?\n\n415\n00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:19.067\nEmployees live in?\n\n416\n00:21:19.067 --> 00:21:19.637\nRight.\n\n417\n00:21:19.637 --> 00:21:24.939\nNot what is the store city\nthat the employee works at?\n\n418\n00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:25.450\nCorrect.\n\n419\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.583\nSo big difference there.\n\n420\n00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:30.376\nBut again, that came from us of what.\n\n421\n00:21:30.376 --> 00:21:32.200\nRight.\nQuestion we wanted to ask.\n\n422\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.360\nSo, it does make a difference, but this\nis how you begin and you do that testing.\n\n423\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.860\nAnd notice as we're changing this, you're\nlearning more and more about the queries.\n\n424\n00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.365\nAnd Vonne is showing me how she can run\naround me in the data, this right here.\n\n425\n00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:46.440\n[LAUGH] In this database as well.\n\n426\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.450\nSo Vonne, that's actually a good thing for\nus to actually run into and encounter.\n\n427\n00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.130\nBecause it did help us to\nactually run the query,\n\n428\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.660\nhelped us to understand our data a little\nbit better, showed us that we can get\n\n429\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.810\nanother result when the design\nis wrong at some point in time.\n\n430\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.200\nSo, not only did we get no results,\nbut this time we got a result that we\n\n431\n00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.680\nreally didn't need to get, no matter\nwhich way we tried to query the data,\n\n432\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.530\nit still didn't turn out\nthe way that we wanted to.\n\n433\n00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.960\nThis, though, is now showing me the proper\ndata, in the way I expected turnout, and\n\n434\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.530\nthat means the design is good, okay?\n\n435\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.875\nSo Vonne, that's actually a good place for\nus to go ahead and stop this.\n\n436\n00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:28.240\nWe've still got some\nissues to take a look at.\n\n437\n00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.950\nBut overall, though, that's kind of\na good one for us to take a look at.\n\n438\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.190\nWell, Ronnie,\nwe worked on our relationships and\n\n439\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.345\nnow everybody's in communication and\neverything is happy and good.\n\n440\n00:22:37.345 --> 00:22:39.150\n[LAUGH] So I learned a lot in this,\n\n441\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.630\nit's really solidifying how to design\ndatabases and how to test them.\n\n442\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.237\nBut like you said, we've got a few more\nissues that we have to work through.\n\n443\n00:22:48.237 --> 00:22:51.748\nSo we're gonna have to come back for\na part five, yes, a part five.\n\n444\n00:22:51.748 --> 00:22:53.800\n[LAUGH] In our mini series.\n\n445\n00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.020\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n446\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.540\nSigning off for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n447\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.540\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n448\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.758\nAnd we'll see you soon.\n\n449\n00:23:00.758 -->

[LAUGH] All right, so there we go.\n\n14\n00:00:43.253 --> 00:00:47.484\nYou're saying, cuz it's our final,\nwe don't know that, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:48.744\n&gt;&gt; That is true [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n16\n00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:53.401\nhopefully it is our final one as we\naddress a few minor issues that are left.\n\n17\n00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:57.107\nAnd this is just more about getting\neverything back to the place where it\n\n18\n00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.200\nneeds to be, and\nwe're still gonna run into issues.\n\n19\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.110\nRemember that part of right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.600\nAnd figuring out and getting\nthe database to work, is to go ahead and\n\n21\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.200\nrun into all those issues before\nwe start to put data real data,\n\n22\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280\nin other words valuable\ndata into our database.\n\n23\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.270\nBecause that's the time you want to do it,\nnot after you've now spent hours and\n\n24\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.260\nhours, and\nmaybe even days of entering data in and\n\n25\n00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.540\nrealizing your database is broken.\n\n26\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.450\nTo run into all the issues now\nis really just a minor set\n\n27\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.980\nback in comparison to when people\nare trying query for a data,\n\n28\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.510\nand this is not showing the right result\nand now you're under a time crunch.\n\n29\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.820\nNow you're trying to figure out stuff,\nand it's not working for you.\n\n30\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.546\n&gt;&gt; And even one step further when\nwe get into reports and forms.\n\n31\n00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:48.920\nWhen you start making those,\nlike everything should be set.\n\n32\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.540\nSo we don't wanna go too far down the road\nin other things that we're gonna do in\n\n33\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.850\naccess, until we kind of get all this.\n\n34\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.206\nThis is kind of a pivotal place\nof where we need to be right now.\n\n35\n00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:00.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou make a solid point there Vonne.\n\n36\n00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:05.425\nThe very fact is, if we can't query\nour data and get it to show what we\n\n37\n00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:10.980\nexpected the show, we can't expect that\na report is going to do any better.\n\n38\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.360\nWe can't expect that if we use forms for\ndata entry,\n\n39\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.041\nthat it's gonna enter data in the right\nplace that we think it's gonna enter, or\n\n40\n00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.822\neven to be able to do other things\nwith forms that we could do.\n\n41\n00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:24.063\nSo that's why it's very important that\nwe get the idea of the querying down\n\n42\n00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:24.815\ncorrectly.\n\n43\n00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:27.208\nAnd once we get that established and\n\n44\n00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:32.153\neverything is working the way that we\nwant to, well, that is essentially\n\n45\n00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:37.840\nthe firm foundation to everything else\nthat we can do inside the Axis database.\n\n46\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.960\nSo that's why we're taking the time and\nthe effort.\n\n47\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.614\nI know, it sounds ridiculous,\nbut five episodes you're saying,\n\n48\n00:02:43.614 --> 00:02:44.711\nRon are you joking?\n\n49\n00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:45.322\nNo, I'm not.\n\n50\n00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:46.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n51\n00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:49.363\nthat's because if you do this right,\nand if you do the testing and\n\n52\n00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:53.390\nyou get all the things worked out,\neverything else becomes much smoother.\n\n53\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in this part of our mini series,\n\n54\n00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:59.653\nwe're kinda focusing on\nsome more logic issues.\n\n55\n00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:04.394\nSome things of where maybe we didn't\nneed this kind of like going back,\n\n56\n00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:08.280\nit's kind of a combination of fields and\nrelationships.\n\n57\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.405\nAnd making sure that what we\nwant it to give us is right.\n\n58\n00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.435\nSo that's like the logic behind it.\n\n59\n00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.475\nSo where we're gonna start with this one?\n\n60\n00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:22.135\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a look at the\nrelationship design of our database and\n\n61\n00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.305\nsee if we can actually work\nout a few other things.\n\n62\n00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.220\nOf course,\nwe're gonna use queries to help us out.\n\n63\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.680\nSo as we take a look at my computer here,\n\n64\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.820\nI want to be able to do just\na couple more queries, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.829\nSo one of the things, of course,\nthat we've done previously, right,\n\n66\n00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.140\nis that we were able to query what\ncustomers bought what products.\n\n67\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.870\nSo let's run that query again, the great\nthing is, I've already saved that query\n\n68\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.630\ndown over here on the right hand\nside of the list, I think I did.\n\n69\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.880\nI'm gonna open it in design view,\nso that we can see this.\n\n70\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.603\nSo lets focus in on the query grid and\nmake sure we understand what it's\n\n71\n00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:59.400\ntelling us, is that we're telling it,\nthat we wanna see the actual customer ID.\n\n72\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.390\nFirst name, last name, with the items and\nthe manufacture, that was kind of our\n\n73\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.540\ninitial one that show that everything\nwas working for us which is fine, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.930\nSo that all works, everything is\nactually the way that we want to, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.520\nBut there are other issues now that we've\nactually changed a few things, that we\n\n76\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.440\nhave to actually think about as well and\ngo back to the relationship window.\n\n77\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.078\nI forget this is actually open right here,\nokay?\n\n78\n00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:26.808\nSo we've kind of done this\nwhere we've disconnected\n\n79\n00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:30.918\nthe actual products from the stores,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:34.925\nRemember that in a previous episode here\nwhere we didn't want that to actually\n\n81\n00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:35.820\nmatch up.\n\n82\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.840\nBut now I also need to make sure then,\nthat I can still query for the stores and\n\n83\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.710\neverything, including what products\nare actually in what stores as well, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.909\nSo at this point though, if I go ahead and\n\n85\n00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.404\nclick on Customer Products here on that\nquery, and let's go back to design view.\n\n86\n00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:58.468\nLet me right-click and\ngo back to design view, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:58.468 --> 00:05:03.804\nNow if I do this and I select,\nlet's say products and\n\n88\n00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.956\nstore number, and I run this,\n\n89\n00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:11.942\nnotice that what I can't find out Vonne,\nokay?\n\n90\n00:05:11.942 --> 00:05:18.920\nI cannot find out the actual store number\nthat, that particular product is in.\n\n91\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.330\nNow it's all linked together,\n\n92\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.610\nI do see where I can link around\nback into the relationships here.\n\n93\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.060\nIt looks like products connected\nthrough the junction tables, sales.\n\n94\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.350\nSales essentially ends up getting\nconnected to the stores, but\n\n95\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.340\nnotice I cannot find out what store number\nthat, that particular product is in.\n\n96\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.280\n&gt;&gt; Or are we saying that what\nparticular store the sale was in?\n\n97\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.610\nWe wanted to know what store this was\nsold at in that particular query.\n\n98\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, so far we can't do any of those.\n\n99\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.750\nSo in this instance where I try to\npull up the actual store number\n\n100\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.420\nfrom the products, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.180\nBack in design we write, I pulled it\nup right here, I can't find that out.\n\n102\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.240\nNow if I try to find out the sales though,\nand what store that appeared in,\n\n103\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.410\nlet me add that in there as part\nof the query, and let me run that.\n\n104\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.695\nNotice though, Vonne, I can find out what\nparticular store a sale happened at?\n\n105\n00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:17.127\n&gt;&gt; Because that's in the table itself.\n\n106\n00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:17.809\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n107\n00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.342\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's where we've got the\nproduct in the store and this is where it\n\n108\n00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:27.120\nwas sold, and so now we know that this\nis the route where it's coming from.\n\n109\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.799\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nat least we know this is the sale.\n\n110\n00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.024\nBut notice Vonne that even\nthe products table though,\n\n111\n00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:36.873\nI can't find out what product is actually\nin that particular store if I wanted to.\n\n112\n00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:40.491\nSo if I wanted to do something like that,\nI don't know what you would or not, but\n\n113\n00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.260\nif you wanted to we're\ngoing to actually do this.\n\n114\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.400\nI need to connect the products and\nthe store number here, or\n\n115\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.330\nI could get rid of it.\n\n116\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330\nIf I want to get rid of it,\nthen I need to get rid of it.\n\n117\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.862\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\n\n118\n00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:55.200\nthat's the thing of like, maybe this\na logical thing of like wait a second.\n\n119\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.393\nOur products that we have in Dancing Dogs\nIncorporated, they aren't store specific.\n\n120\n00:07:02.393 --> 00:07:03.404\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In a sense of,\n\n121\n00:07:03.404 --> 00:07:08.392\nI just wanted to list what our products\nthat we have for all of the company.\n\n122\n00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:13.771\nSo this is something to where,\nwell, we don't really want\n\n123\n00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:19.376\nto have like an inventory\nnecessarily in our products table.\n\n124\n00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:23.709\nSo this kinda goes into a couple\ndifferent places where it could go.\n\n125\n00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's like, they're not source specific.\n\n126\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n127\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.600\n&gt;&gt; So we really don't want\nthat feel in that table.\n\n128\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n129\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.060\n&gt;&gt; And if we wanted to do,\ntell me what store like an inventory,\n\n130\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.970\nthat goes into a whole other\narea that we're talking about,\n\n131\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.710\nthat we're gonna go into like\nan advanced access and everything.\n\n132\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.470\nBut for right now, this is the logic\nof products are not store specific.\n\n133\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.532\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we don't want that.\n\n134\n00:07:48.532 --> 00:07:51.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so we don't really\nwant this to actually show up.\n\n135\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.934\nSo if somebody tries to query for this,\n\n136\n00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:54.907\nwe instead are actually\ngonna turn that around.\n\n137\n00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:58.125\nI said that we do wanna show,\nI was trying to make sure that we didn't.\n\n138\n00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.965\nI don't know why in my mind I\nwas saying it that way, but\n\n139\n00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:01.416\nthat's exactly what happened in my mind.\n\n140\n00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:04.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, that's why we're here\ntogether to work through these issues.\n\n141\n00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:06.108\nAnd like, wait the logic order of.\n\n142\n00:08:06.108 --> 00:08:08.386\nWhat did we want from this database?\n\n143\n00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:10.670\nI know we do want that eventually.\n\n144\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.284\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n145\n00:08:11.284 --> 00:08:15.850\n&gt;&gt; But that gets somewhere a little\ndeeper down the rabbit hole.\n\n146\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.511\n&gt;&gt; So, at this point,\nwhat's the simplest thing for us to do?\n\n147\n00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:22.591\nIt's to simply go in and remove that\nparticular field from that table cuz we\n\n148\n00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:24.809\ndon't want too many querying for this.\n\n149\n00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:28.240\nOkay, so that's what we don't want\nto actually end up happening.\n\n150\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.290\nOkay, so we wanna make sure that\nwe go ahead and remove that.\n\n151\n00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.920\nAnd then in our updated database or\n\n152\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.050\nour fixed database here,\nsee if I can switch over to that.\n\n153\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.350\nWell, okay, nevermind, let me see\nif I can find the right one here.\n\n154\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.290\nSo this one, I'm gonna verify it does\nsay fixed right up here at the top.\n\n155\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.840\nAnd now you can see that in the Products\ntable, I went ahead and I changed this to\n\n156\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.480\nwhere we're no longer be able to query the\nstore number out of the Products table.\n\n157\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.480\nAnd you do want that happen in case\nsomebody else is creating queries for you,\n\n158\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.240\nand they accidentally come\nacross that store number or\n\n159\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.120\nstore ID in their products.\n\n160\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.110\nAnd that way, they're not gonna query for\nthat here, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.801\nSo that is a logical issue that we can\neasily fix by simply removing that right\n\n162\n00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:15.899\nout of the table,\nthey'll never query for that.\n\n163\n00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:18.644\nAt least at this point,\nthey won't have that to worry about.\n\n164\n00:09:18.644 --> 00:09:22.220\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis kinda goes into where the sales.\n\n165\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:28.190\nThe sales is really gonna tell us\nwhat store the product was sold in.\n\n166\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.704\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n167\n00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:33.684\nit becomes that the sales table\nkinda becomes the central focus that\n\n168\n00:09:33.684 --> 00:09:37.451\ncan give us that particular information,\nright?\n\n169\n00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's what we want.\n\n170\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.820\nSo we've now gotten rid\nof this store number.\n\n171\n00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.410\nI went back to the database issues one,\nright, the one that's broken.\n\n172\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.290\nAnd I removed the store number\nnow as far as the fixed one goes,\n\n173\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.270\nnow I need to connect\nthe store though to that sale.\n\n174\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.280\nThe great thing is we went ahead and\nwe added in the store number here, and\n\n175\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.940\nnow I need to link it here.\n\n176\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.600\nNow it's already linked\nthrough the employees table.\n\n177\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.619\nBut if I want to make sure that I can\nquery this without the employees table,\n\n178\n00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:12.419\nI can also go ahead and\nadd it directly in.\n\n179\n00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:18.884\nThis particular relationship is\nbecause I'm ready to running a query.\n\n180\n00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:22.056\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was like, hey, you're ready doing\n\n181\n00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:25.694\nthis, let me click cancel here,\nclose out of the products right now.\n\n182\n00:10:27.521 --> 00:10:29.900\nNow I'm not gonna save the changes.\n\n183\n00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.710\nLet me close out of this one too\njust in case that affects it.\n\n184\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.310\nI always forget stuff like this sometimes.\n\n185\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.222\nNow, Vonne, I don't know why, but\nI didn't mention this before and\n\n186\n00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:43.998\nwe were talking about this even between\nshows, creating these link relationships,\n\n187\n00:10:43.998 --> 00:10:45.940\nright, it can be a bit confusing.\n\n188\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.879\nAnd I kind of assumed,\nbecause I've been working with it so long.\n\n189\n00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:51.719\nBut if you need to create\nthese relationships,\n\n190\n00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:57.170\nmake sure you select and you hover over,\nokay, the actual field that you want.\n\n191\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:02.280\nClick and drag, and then you can\nactually pop it and go directly\n\n192\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.090\nover the store number and that should\ngive you the proper field relationship.\n\n193\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.620\nSometimes though, if you do this wrong\nlike you go and go okay, I selected custom\n\n194\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.290\nID, notice it shows up and you should\nget a validate that is not the same.\n\n195\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.170\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's something that I kept doing is,\n\n196\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.670\nI was just dragging it just kinda-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n197\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.793\n&gt;&gt; Willy nilly like,\njust put it in this table and I'm like,\n\n198\n00:11:21.793 --> 00:11:22.688\nwhy is it not connecting?\n\n199\n00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:27.321\nCuz I thought it just did it automatically\nlike, it just found the match, but\n\n200\n00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:32.310\nyou were actually letting go of the mouse\nover that particular field and I'm like.\n\n201\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.742\nBut as you said,\nyou can change it here if you need to.\n\n202\n00:11:35.742 --> 00:11:37.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you click in that field and\n\n203\n00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:41.895\ngo, that's the wrong one from the sales\ntable, then I can scroll down here\n\n204\n00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:45.680\nto store number, and\nI can also fix it right here too, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.080\nMake sure you validate this\nrelationship type here.\n\n206\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.080\nIn Access, you're gonna either see\none to one or one to many, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.680\nThat's the two that you want to see.\n\n208\n00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.018\nIf it shows you a one to many,\nmore than likely it means that,\n\n209\n00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.975\nsomewhere in your design\nis probably not gonna work.\n\n210\n00:12:01.975 --> 00:12:04.375\nBut go ahead and put create there and\n\n211\n00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:08.383\nnow, it didn't actually\ndo referencial integrity.\n\n212\n00:12:08.383 --> 00:12:13.390\nI wanna enforce referential integrity, and\nthen make sure that is there too, okay.\n\n213\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:18.890\nSo that is the other relationship that\nwe want to make sure of, and now if I go\n\n214\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:25.160\nback to our fixed design, make sure I\nalways gotta read before I continue on.\n\n215\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.910\nSo there it is, it says, fix.\n\n216\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.140\nYou see where it actually went ahead and\nI went ahead and created that.\n\n217\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.829\nSo now,\nI should be able to select the store\n\n218\n00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:41.200\nproduct here, And the sales as well.\n\n219\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.882\nAnd then we go to Design view, Notice that\n\n220\n00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:50.950\nthe query actually kind of creates its\nown way of doing things at times as well.\n\n221\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.830\nSo you can now see all\nthe relationships connected here.\n\n222\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.160\nSo I pulled in Item Name\nfrom the products,\n\n223\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.390\nthe sales from the sales ID,\nstore number from the stores.\n\n224\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.260\nI didn't have to pull it\nin from the Sales table,\n\n225\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.270\nI pulled it in directly from the stores.\n\n226\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.920\nIt actually all linked up\nto what I wanted to, I Run.\n\n227\n00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.890\nAnd now I can see what employee sold\nwhat particular sale in what store\n\n228\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.020\nas well, okay.\n\n229\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.914\nAnd even the item name and\nsome of the others ones here to.\n\n230\n00:13:17.914 --> 00:13:20.099\nSo a lot of adult beef and\n\n231\n00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:23.175\ngravy packs are being sold-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:24.081\n&gt;&gt; Is what we see, and\n\n233\n00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:27.160\nI don't even know what a Dog Dazzler is,\nwhat's a Dog Dazzler?\n\n234\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.805\n&gt;&gt; It's a Dog Dazzler collar.\n\n235\n00:13:28.805 --> 00:13:30.300\n&gt;&gt; And what's a Dog Dazzler collar?\n\n236\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.161\n&gt;&gt; It means it's a really\ndazzling collar for your dog.\n\n237\n00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:34.379\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well there you go, okay.\n\n238\n00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:37.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that makes sense, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:37.255 --> 00:13:38.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Gotta sparkle.\n\n240\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.556\n&gt;&gt; What's a Danny Duck down, what is this?\n\n241\n00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:43.951\n&gt;&gt; It's like a chew toy,\n\n242\n00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:48.590\nlike you see the toys that are in\ndifferent shaped animals and everything.\n\n243\n00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.370\nSo it's a duck and it's Danny Duck.\n\n244\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.685\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go, okay.\n\n245\n00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:55.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is what we wanted to be able to\n\n246\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.260\ndo, we wanna make sure that we go\nthrough every single table, right?\n\n247\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:06.660\nAs we make queries, fix them where we\nhave to fix the broken thing, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.860\nIs it gonna take time, yes?\n\n249\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.631\nOkay, will you kind of pull\nyour hair out a little bit,\n\n250\n00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:13.211\ntrying to work through logic?\n\n251\n00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:17.005\nYes, but in the end result, all you have\nto do once you actually believe that\n\n252\n00:14:17.005 --> 00:14:18.846\nyou've gone through every table and\n\n253\n00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:22.016\nyou've done this is now you\ncontinue to create those queries.\n\n254\n00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:25.892\nYou run several examples of real types\nof queries that you want to run,\n\n255\n00:14:25.892 --> 00:14:29.480\nyou may even have to get somebody\nelse's help, right, Vonne?\n\n256\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.910\nSo for instance,\nI may actually have to come to you and go,\n\n257\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.530\nwhat else would we be querying for\nif we were doing this?\n\n258\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.720\nAnd then that way,\nwe build the query together and\n\n259\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.100\nsee if we get the results that\nwe were expecting to see.\n\n260\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.295\nBecause that's the real\ntest is now putting it and\n\n261\n00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:47.030\nmaybe pulling somebody in that says,\na manager, right?\n\n262\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.692\nWhat else would you like to see in this?\n\n263\n00:14:49.692 --> 00:14:54.010\nAnd get them to ask the questions and\nsee if you can pull that data result up.\n\n264\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:15:01.010\nOnce you get all that verified,\nyour database is now in good design.\n\n265\n00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.532\nAnd that means,\nyou can take the dummy data and\n\n266\n00:15:04.532 --> 00:15:09.585\nkind of delete it out of those tables,\nor you can do what I would do,\n\n267\n00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:14.305\nwhich is, you made a backup copy and\nput a lot of data in there.\n\n268\n00:15:14.305 --> 00:15:16.677\nThen I'd go into those\nbackup copies instead,\n\n269\n00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:20.529\nwhere I don't have as much data, and\ndelete the data out of there as well, and\n\n270\n00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:23.740\nthen start all over to get\nyour data entry ready to go.\n\n271\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.990\nYeah, and I mean, that's where we were\ntalking about it could be a relationship\n\n272\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.440\nbetween the tables that we need to fix.\n\n273\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.802\nOr it could be we needed to delete\na field, or maybe we needed to add a field\n\n274\n00:15:32.802 --> 00:15:37.609\nwhich we've had to do because, one,\nit didn't come over from the Excel file.\n\n275\n00:15:37.609 --> 00:15:40.974\nOr, for example,\nwhat if we wanted to have, well,\n\n276\n00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:44.895\nwe have our customer loyalty program,\nright?\n\n277\n00:15:44.895 --> 00:15:48.272\nWe'e seen that we fixed that\nrelationship of the mismatched data\n\n278\n00:15:48.272 --> 00:15:49.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n279\n00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:55.130\n&gt;&gt; But then, we could let's do a scenario\nin a sense that you have a loyalty program\n\n280\n00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.303\nbut I could go buy at multiple stores\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n281\n00:15:57.303 --> 00:16:01.706\n&gt;&gt; Right, and especially if you had\nmultiple in say Gainesville, or whatever,\n\n282\n00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:05.910\nand I'm thinking of the loyalty program\nthat I'm part of My own pet shop and\n\n283\n00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.730\neverything.\n\n284\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.591\nAnd; so, then,\nI could go to multiple stores, well,\n\n285\n00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:15.720\nI have a home store but then,\nI also can have sales in other stores.\n\n286\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.290\nSo this whole idea of, alright,\nwhat if I need pull up,\n\n287\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.880\nnot just the sales of where\nthat loyalty came from,\n\n288\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.500\nthat loyalty customer, but what is\nthat loyalty customer's home store.\n\n289\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.749\nThose types of things, so that's where\nlooking at our customer table we,\n\n290\n00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:37.080\nin here in the fixed one\nwe added a store number,\n\n291\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.350\nbecause that's the one\nwhere they came from.\n\n292\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.950\nAnd that's like we're okay there's\nno other kind of relationship here.\n\n293\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.900\nThis is really just like raw data\nthat we would need in a table.\n\n294\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.730\nSo sometimes it comes down to that and\n\n295\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.260\njust working through the logic and\nwhat you need to fix in.\n\n296\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.760\n&gt;&gt; So Yvonne pointed out the other\nissue that I had that if we\n\n297\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.930\nreally need to distinguish between that.\n\n298\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.737\nSo here you have this idea of what store,\nthis is what sales took place in.\n\n299\n00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.650\nSo that's what the field does.\n\n300\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:08.820\nBut notice right here,\n\n301\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:14.230\nhere's that idea of that example The Home\nStore, that a customer may actually be in,\n\n302\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.100\nwhere they designated as their\nown home store, they chose to.\n\n303\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.000\n&gt;&gt; And right now, with all of this data,\nit's all going to be the same.\n\n304\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because we don't have any other stores.\n\n305\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.570\nBut when you think about that,\nthat could be something you might want\n\n306\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:33.030\nfrom your data, and you gotta know where\nto put it in the right place, basically.\n\n307\n00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now I want to point out one other\nthing here, Yvonne, is that I added in\n\n308\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.200\nkind of this unusual generic name\nwhere it says cash customer, okay.\n\n309\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.780\nAnd notice that this one doesn't actually\nhave a store location at all, and\n\n310\n00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.070\nlet's say that that's the example\nthat Yvonn was talking about here.\n\n311\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.120\nThat this particular customer,\nhe wasn't part of the loyalty program,\n\n312\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.029\nso we don't have his name on file.\n\n313\n00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:58.821\nWe don't have anything, we don't know\neven know what his home store is.\n\n314\n00:17:58.821 --> 00:18:02.745\nBut he just walked into any of our stores,\nand\n\n315\n00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:07.410\nhe chose to pay cash for\na six pack of chew rope as well.\n\n316\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:13.880\nWell I couldn't identify the idea of\nthe cash customer easily in this database.\n\n317\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.050\nSo the way that I did it is I simply\nassigned him a customer ID of this.\n\n318\n00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.250\nAnd then Cash Customer,\n\n319\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.260\nI just typed in this name to\nhelp me identify that instead.\n\n320\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.370\nSo these could be representative of\ndifferent even at different stores if we\n\n321\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.440\nwanted to where they came in.\n\n322\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.322\nIt could be totally different costumers,\nbut I had to have to some way to designate\n\n323\n00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.894\nthat as being just\na customer of some sort.\n\n324\n00:18:36.894 --> 00:18:41.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because of the way we built it\nand the way the relationships it means\n\n325\n00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:45.420\nthat every single sale would be\nsomebody in the loyalty program.\n\n326\n00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.520\nThis is the only base of customers that we\nhave in a real life situation in a sense.\n\n327\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.630\nNo, you wouldn't have that.\n\n328\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.070\nYou would have somebody that is not part\nof the loyalty program that came in.\n\n329\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.818\nWhen we did cash, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that they paid cash.\n\n330\n00:18:59.818 --> 00:19:04.590\nIt could just be any form of payment\nis just a non loyalty customer.\n\n331\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n332\n00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.720\nthen we were saying you\ncould have a vendor code or\n\n333\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.670\na employee code and\nthen an employee bought it.\n\n334\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.284\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That's why it's in a different way so\n\n335\n00:19:13.284 --> 00:19:14.790\nyou could kind of track that so.\n\n336\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:20.100\nIf you're doing that,\nthat's one way to differentiate the type\n\n337\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.790\nof customer as inside of\nyour loyalty program.\n\n338\n00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.060\nSo that way you don't have\nto do two separate things,\n\n339\n00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:31.070\nits all in one table because those\nare your types of customers.\n\n340\n00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it does make sense and\nthat's where you'll find more,\n\n341\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.600\nbut you've got to remember that if\nyou keep your particular database\n\n342\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.990\nright on scope and on focus,\nyou may not have to add these things in.\n\n343\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.200\nBut as I started seeing it,\n\n344\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.370\nI realized, if I didn't track it because\nthe way that Yvonne set up the data,\n\n345\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.520\nshe had more of these people that paid\ncash that weren't part of the program.\n\n346\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.041\nAnd I was like I've got to be able\nto account for that and I need to,\n\n347\n00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:56.451\nso if I don't, [right,\n\n348\n00:19:56.451 --> 00:20:00.970\nit throws off all the other things that\nI would really want to run reports on.\n\n349\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.010\nSo if I were to generate how much data,\n\n350\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.940\nhow much sales did we actually have and\nI didn't account for all of those\n\n351\n00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.120\nnumbers that had sales or a customer\ndo them, it would leave those out.\n\n352\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.454\nSo this is the way that I chose to do\nthat as an example in our database.\n\n353\n00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:24.562\n&gt;&gt; And this is also another example of\nsay you're talking to your employees or\n\n354\n00:20:24.562 --> 00:20:28.790\nthe board directors, and\nlike whoever is like, I want this.\n\n355\n00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:34.030\nLike you task me with this, I say this is\nwhat I wanted, you as like the designer\n\n356\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.480\nof the database say, okay I see where\nyou're going, but I'm gonna have to do\n\n357\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.890\na few things here to make this logically\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n358\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:42.750\n&gt;&gt; Work.\n\n359\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.830\nAnd that kind of happens sometimes, cuz\nyou add in some things, like the whole,\n\n360\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.100\nand we talked about it back in he\nlike loyalty ID and the customer ID.\n\n361\n00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.956\nI thought that the loyalty ID was all\nwe needed but then we needed, but\n\n362\n00:20:54.956 --> 00:20:57.840\nthen we need another field for\nlike that primary and\n\n363\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.450\nit's just those types of things\nthat you just have to work through.\n\n364\n00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, and but the more time\nthat you spend in doing that,\n\n365\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.700\nmeans that when this all is said and\ndone everything is going to be ready for\n\n366\n00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.220\nyou for data entry to go on and\nthen you can start doing the real query's.\n\n367\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:18.080\nFrom that point you can start controlling\nthe actually data entry of everything and\n\n368\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.700\nthen even creating reports.\n\n369\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.480\nBut Yvonne at least for\nnow our design and our phase of hopefully\n\n370\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.430\nwalking people through the way that we\nthought we set it up perfectly, and\n\n371\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.400\nwe found out we didn't\nreally set it up perfectly.\n\n372\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.790\nHopefully we walked through them, and\nthey were able to see our logic and\n\n373\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.980\nhow we fixed it.\n\n374\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.320\nAnd now we can move on and\ncreate some other things.\n\n375\n00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I feel we've been up and\ndown and all around.\n\n376\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.600\nAnd gone through all of our different\nthings that we were going through,\n\n377\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.540\nour mini series of.\n\n378\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Queries.\n\n379\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.380\nOur query mini series.\n\n380\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.655\nAnd now it's coming to a close, and I feel\nlike I need to shed a little tear because.\n\n381\n00:21:52.655 --> 00:21:54.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we're done with queries.\n\n382\n00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.760\nBut the exciting thing is\nthat we're gonna come back.\n\n383\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.595\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; With some more mini series.\n\n384\n00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:01.740\n[LAUGH] Or at least some episodes, right?\n\n385\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n386\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.529\n&gt;&gt; And going on to moving on to our new\nthings in our new things in our access,\n\n387\n00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:10.650\nIn the world of access, and\nseriously I want to start singing and\n\n388\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.365\nmaking closing music and everything for us\n&gt;&gt; Woah\n\n389\n00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:16.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we'll go ahead and\n\n390\n00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:17.582\nnot do that [LAUGH].\n\n391\n00:22:17.582 --> 00:22:21.833\nWell we have wrapped up so we're going to\ngo ahead and sign off for Office Pro TV,\n\n392\n00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:24.340\nI've been your host Yvonne Smith\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong\n\n393\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.819\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n394\n00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:30.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I am doing fine, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.765\nThank you again for the invitation\nback to OfficePro Studio this year.\n\n10\n00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.500\nAs we continue on taking a look\nof course at Access 2016,\n\n11\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.064\nwe are now talking about\nof course creating forms.\n\n12\n00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:44.000\nNow Vonee, we've already created tables,\n\n13\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.720\nwe've done through a little bit of\ndesign basics, we've created queries.\n\n14\n00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.760\nWe will actually have\nto ask that question,\n\n15\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.770\nwhy in the world do we\nneed to create forms?\n\n16\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.202\nSo it's actually a good question for\nus to spend a little bit of time on.\n\n17\n00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:02.676\nSo Vonne, if you were to take\na guess at the idea here of trying.\n\n18\n00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:06.458\nNow that you understand that we've gotten\neverything done, we've done our testing,\n\n19\n00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:08.090\neverything is working.\n\n20\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.686\nWhat is a form about in the database?\n\n21\n00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:11.243\nWhat do you think the answer would be?\n\n22\n00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:13.165\n&gt;&gt; Well, normally when you have forms,\n\n23\n00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:16.350\nthere's only certain things\nthat you can do in the forms.\n\n24\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.150\nLike if it asks you to enter your name,\nyou can type a name.\n\n25\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.400\nOr, there's certain ones where\nthere's like a dropdown menu.\n\n26\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.890\nSo where it's controlling\nlike what state are you in?\n\n27\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.601\nWell, if these are your only choices,\nso you can't just willy-nilly add in any\n\n28\n00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:34.845\ninformation that you want, so\nyou can kinda control things with forms.\n\n29\n00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:39.020\nSo, I'm assuming that's where you can\ncontrol how stuff is entered into your\n\n30\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.767\ndatabase and we've kind of already\nhinted on that in our vocabulary.\n\n31\n00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:45.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I've been paying attention, Ronnie.\n\n32\n00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.634\nI was like, I know that definition so.\n\n33\n00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:48.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n34\n00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:50.320\nyeah, Vonne and you're right.\n\n35\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.610\nThe very fact is we need\nsome type of control.\n\n36\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.720\nLet's take a look at my machine and\nlet's talk about what we mean here\n\n37\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.030\nif the language that we've been\nusing is a little bit confusing.\n\n38\n00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.616\nSo remember, we already created tables and\nqueries, and\n\n39\n00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:04.161\nwe're about to work in this\ngrouping here called forms.\n\n40\n00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:09.100\nBut I launched up this customer's\ntable just a few seconds ago, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.510\nIf we want to start doing some\ndata entry right now, okay, well,\n\n42\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.180\nhow do I do this in this table, Vonne?\n\n43\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.670\nOkay, well, it's simple.\n\n44\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.110\nDown here at the bottom left-hand corner\njust about, notice that I have this\n\n45\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.710\nability to be able to move through records\nby using these navigation tools down here.\n\n46\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.320\nSo I have where I can go to the next\nrecord of course using this.\n\n47\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.240\nI can of course go to the last record.\n\n48\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.294\nI can continue to navigate around, but it\ngives me this button right here too, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:39.980\nNew blank record, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.610\nWell that new blank record,\nI don't have to even use that.\n\n51\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.130\nIf I want to, I can just use the scroll\nbar over on the right-hand side,\n\n52\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.840\nscroll down, oops,\nscroll way down before I wanted to, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.020\nNow, I just click on this next field here,\nand\n\n54\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.770\nI simply start typing in\nthe information that I want.\n\n55\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.100\nNow Vonne,\nyou can see I already did that one time\n\n56\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.580\nearlier to trying make our data work\nthe way that I wanted to for number 25.\n\n57\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.220\nNotice I didn't have to enter\nin everything in there, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.620\nI skip Loyalty IDs,\nStore Number, Address, and\n\n59\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.390\neverything because I needed a way to\nbe able to account for cash customers,\n\n60\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.310\nby just name the cash customer\nthat's all I ended up doing, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.740\nBut Vonne,\nin that particular instance, okay,\n\n62\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.345\nthat was just because I wanted to work and\nI wanted to be able to account for that.\n\n63\n00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:33.140\nThere's a lot of times when we\nare not the only ones that´s gonna\n\n64\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.250\nbe doing the data entry, and\nwe don't want a record like that, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.290\nVonne, with this particular record here,\non cash customers, do I know, perhaps,\n\n66\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.050\nwhat particular store they might\nof even actually gone into?\n\n67\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.914\n&gt;&gt; No, I mean, you don't have any\nof the information that you need or\n\n68\n00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:53.477\nthat you might need if this, I know why\nwe did this for a very specific purpose.\n\n69\n00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:58.259\nAnd it's not fine to not have like\nthe information, there's just this\n\n70\n00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:03.132\nsomebody else, you need to have\nthe loyalty number and the customer ID.\n\n71\n00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And,\n\n72\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.114\nsince the customer ID is the primary,\nright,\n\n73\n00:04:06.114 --> 00:04:09.940\nyou don't wanna duplicate record and\nall those different types of things.\n\n74\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.950\nSo this would be something if\nit was like a regular customer\n\n75\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.730\nthis would be missing information.\n\n76\n00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.644\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it would like kind of,\n\n77\n00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:21.172\nI don't know if corrupt is too strong of\n\n78\n00:04:21.172 --> 00:04:23.857\na word but kind of-\n&gt;&gt; It leaves gaps in the information that\n\n79\n00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:24.850\nwe're trying to pull.\n\n80\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\ncuz corrupt sounds so broken,\n\n81\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.310\nbut it could lead to some\nreally broken results if you're\n\n82\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.120\nrelying on things a store number\nthat the customer has brought.\n\n83\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's true.\n\n84\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.229\nSo, the reason why I wanted to point\nthis out, right, is that it gives us\n\n85\n00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.489\nthis ability to actually enter in the data\nthat we want, I know at the minimum.\n\n86\n00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:44.600\nVonne's right.\n\n87\n00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.690\nI need to enter in the customer ID,\n\n88\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.150\nbut I didn't really need to\nenter anything else in here.\n\n89\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.360\nIt would probably just let me\nenter in a customer ID and\n\n90\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.050\nI could have gone on with the next record.\n\n91\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.308\nI would have had blank everything else.\n\n92\n00:04:55.308 --> 00:04:57.960\nWell, Vonne, then we go and\nquery this information and\n\n93\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.530\nyou see customer number 25, but\nyou don't know what it means.\n\n94\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.320\nIt doesn't mean anything.\n\n95\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.320\nSo a form though can give us this ability\n\n96\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.430\nto help us out a little bit more\nwhere what we can do is we can say,\n\n97\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.610\nhere's the information you\nmust enter in when we want to.\n\n98\n00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.950\nSo it can provide a measure\nof control as well.\n\n99\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.387\n&gt;&gt; It's like those required fields.\n\n100\n00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:21.030\nI mean,\nwe probably fill out forms all day long.\n\n101\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.853\nWell, you fill out a form to get to\nactually access this Access show,\n\n102\n00:05:25.853 --> 00:05:29.856\ncuz you had to become a member\nof OfficeProTV or ITProTV.\n\n103\n00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:33.854\nAnd so that's were it had just\nlike you have to insert your name,\n\n104\n00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:37.854\nyou have to insert your date of birth,\nor whatever that record or\n\n105\n00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:42.890\ninformation that we need so we have\nform controls that we can put on there.\n\n106\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.211\n&gt;&gt; And form controls will come along for\nus at least at a later day and\n\n107\n00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:50.583\nmight be a series I will\ndo on the Access Advanced.\n\n108\n00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:54.030\nBut at this point, you gotta understand\nthat forms really do help us.\n\n109\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.573\nThey also can help us by doing this.\n\n110\n00:05:55.573 --> 00:06:01.066\nVonne, let's say that this is not you and\nme doing the damage but\n\n111\n00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:05.210\nwe handed it off to\nsomeone else to do this.\n\n112\n00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.270\nAnd we said, all right,\nhere's all you have to do.\n\n113\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.088\nCopy what's on these paper forms and\nput it in there.\n\n114\n00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:12.933\nWhen they start to copy information, and\n\n115\n00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:15.870\nthen lets say they look\nat this right here.\n\n116\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.680\nNow Vonne,\nyou're a better speller than I am, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.580\nWindermere, that looks right to me.\n\n118\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.180\nBut let's say that the person\nthat did that entry said,\n\n119\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.670\nthat's not how you spell Windermere.\n\n120\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.650\nAnd they come in here and\nthey start changing that.\n\n121\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.530\nOr, they start looking and go wait,\nthat's not how you spell John.\n\n122\n00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.980\nIt should be spelled\nsome other different way.\n\n123\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.635\nWell, this actually allows someone that\ndoesn't really have any information\n\n124\n00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:42.142\nabout what was actually entered in there.\n\n125\n00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:47.305\nAnd why it was entered in the way that\nthey did to start inadvertently updating,\n\n126\n00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:52.120\nor what we call unauthorized updating\nof the records as well, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.202\nWell that can be just as damaging because\nthe people that probably entered it\n\n128\n00:06:56.202 --> 00:06:59.404\nin in the first place and\nknew exactly what they were doing.\n\n129\n00:06:59.404 --> 00:07:02.905\nYou've gotta understand that maybe\nWindermere is not the way that that person\n\n130\n00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:05.690\nwould have spelled it, but\nit is the correct spelling.\n\n131\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.760\nWhatever it is, we don't want anybody\nelse inadvertently doing this.\n\n132\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.040\nAnd our eyes automatically do this,\nright Vonne?\n\n133\n00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.700\nWe look at all of these different fields\nin here, and all of a sudden I go, that\n\n134\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.800\ncan't be the proper spelling and for some\nreason it bugs me enough I feel like what?\n\n135\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.060\nI've got to go in and\nI've got to change that.\n\n136\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.950\nWell, that's not something\nI really want to happen,\n\n137\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.160\nespecially by someone that doesn't\nknow what the data is, okay.\n\n138\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.644\nSo this is something that we really\nwant to make sure that we understand and\n\n139\n00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:35.300\nforms can help us to control\nstuff like that as well.\n\n140\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I know that\ntalking to you about databases\n\n141\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.870\nthroughout all these years and\neverything like that.\n\n142\n00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:47.402\nThat you always say, don't let your\nusers manipulate the tables themselves.\n\n143\n00:07:47.402 --> 00:07:50.460\nIt's like the sacred ground or\nsomething like that.\n\n144\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.733\nYou don't want people going\ndirectly to the source data.\n\n145\n00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:55.257\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n146\n00:07:55.257 --> 00:08:00.315\n&gt;&gt; You wanna protect that source data,\nand this is exactly where forms comes\n\n147\n00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:05.690\ninto play Is don't have them interact\nwith your data with the tables.\n\n148\n00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.360\nThey interact with the forms cuz then\nyou control what they can and cannot do.\n\n149\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nit really does make a difference here.\n\n150\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.270\nThe very fact that we can do that\ninadvertent updating means also somebody\n\n151\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.620\ncould possibly come in and\nselect a record right here.\n\n152\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.581\nRight-click on it.\n\n153\n00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:25.040\nAnd notice this, Vonne, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.930\nThat gives them access to be able\nto delete a record if they want to.\n\n155\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.440\nLet's say that just think\nthey're only deleting stuff that\n\n156\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.020\nthey entered in because they thought\nthat they entered in incorrectly.\n\n157\n00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.350\nWell, do they know that?\n\n158\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.530\nDo they absolutely know how many\nrecords that they entered in?\n\n159\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.003\nAre they just saying,\nI think I only entered in five or six?\n\n160\n00:08:42.003 --> 00:08:44.349\nAnd all of sudden they select instead,\n\n161\n00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:48.940\nlet's say, all of a sudden they\nselect all these along with it.\n\n162\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.603\nSo this is something\nthat we want to prevent.\n\n163\n00:08:51.603 --> 00:08:56.193\nWe don't really want anybody messing\naround the data that already exists in our\n\n164\n00:08:56.193 --> 00:08:56.752\ntables.\n\n165\n00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.780\nAnd along with this, right?\n\n166\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.820\nIf they have access to all this, well,\nthey can also start manipulating and\n\n167\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.610\nchanging all the other data here as well.\n\n168\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.020\nBut any of this unauthorized modification\nor deletion is really a bad thing.\n\n169\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.310\nForms can help us control that, too.\n\n170\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.780\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's where I get into organization.\n\n171\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.790\nYou might like,\nI've never even looked at the tables,\n\n172\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.973\nI've never even seen these tables.\n\n173\n00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.030\nWhich, if you're watching these episodes,\nis like I don't see any of that.\n\n174\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.830\nI mean,\ndepending on what level of database you\n\n175\n00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.180\nhave in within your organization, you\nmight have like a database administrator,\n\n176\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.650\nthat they're the only ones\nthat has access to the tables.\n\n177\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you,\n\n178\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.080\nI know we're getting kind of beyond\nthis scope of a basic class right now.\n\n179\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you can lock things down and\n\n180\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440\nput security on it.\n\n181\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.550\n&gt;&gt; And so on and so\nforth when you have multiple users.\n\n182\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.740\nSo this is where you might, okay,\nwell I've seen these forms.\n\n183\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.290\nAnd you might not even be able\nto manipulate the forms, but\n\n184\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.670\nat least you have an idea now why.\n\n185\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The forms exist in the first place.\n\n186\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.920\n&gt;&gt; And now, Vonne, you might be\nwondering why do I keep harping on this?\n\n187\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.780\nBecause it's really that important.\n\n188\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.830\nNow, Vonne, what if it's not a deletion or\na modification mistake that somebody has,\n\n189\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.900\nbut in this sense that without the forms,\nthey\n\n190\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.220\nalso end up having access to data that\nthey don't need to have access to, right?\n\n191\n00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.878\nSo someone could be doing data entry and\nthey come here and\n\n192\n00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:15.630\ngo, I wonder if I could just take\na look at the sales stuff, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.960\nAnd this is also problematic as well.\n\n194\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.823\nThe very fact that we essentially end up\ngranting somebody unauthorized access in\n\n195\n00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:28.756\nthese tables, they may not do anything to\nmodify or update or delete anything, but\n\n196\n00:10:28.756 --> 00:10:34.170\njust having access or unauthorized access\nto this data may not be what they want to.\n\n197\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.610\nOr what if or one, and\nthis would be a bad idea.\n\n198\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.660\nBut what if we actually\nkept like basic daily or\n\n199\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.810\nhourly salary information in\nour employees table here, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.500\nAnd they noticed that\ntheir name was in it.\n\n201\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.280\nAnd they noticed that Ronnie or\nVonne's name was in it.\n\n202\n00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.860\nThey started getting curious.\n\n203\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.990\nI wonder if I slide on over and\nsee if Ronnie and Vonne.\n\n204\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.830\nLook at that.\n\n205\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.810\nThere's how much they make, too!\n\n206\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.630\nOnce again, this is information we\ndon't want them just having as well.\n\n207\n00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.620\nWe can control it by using forms.\n\n208\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.190\nAnd that's why it's so\nimportant that I emphasize all of this.\n\n209\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.876\nCuz if not, beginning users,right, Vonne?\n\n210\n00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:10.850\nThis is what we do.\n\n211\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.450\nIt takes a little bit of time and\nlearning how to use the forms.\n\n212\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.700\nBut we get frustrated very easily and\n\n213\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.840\nwe'll just say let me just enter\nthe data into the tables, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.380\nWell, yes, you can do that.\n\n215\n00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.510\nBut remember, when you start to hand\nit off to somebody else to do it,\n\n216\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.570\nthey aren't going to take\nthe same approach that you are.\n\n217\n00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.588\nAnd they may have other means than,\nother just unintentional at times here,\n\n218\n00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:40.510\ninadvertently looking at data that\nthey shouldn't look at as well.\n\n219\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.010\nSo that's why we want to get into\nunderstanding and creating these forms.\n\n220\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, that, you can just think\nabout the internal conflict you could\n\n221\n00:11:48.017 --> 00:11:52.205\ncause by looking at data that you're not\nreally supposed to look at, HR records,\n\n222\n00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:53.550\nthings like that.\n\n223\n00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.550\nAnd you hear it even in the news about\nthese data breaches, and this and that.\n\n224\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.570\nBut it goes along the same\nline of making sure you secure\n\n225\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.670\nyour data in whichever\nlevel you want it to be.\n\n226\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.655\nSo that's how we're\ngoing to use our forms.\n\n227\n00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:09.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So what's our first step that we do?\n\n228\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the first thing\nthat we are going to do, right,\n\n229\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.480\nis just to make sure that we understand\nwhat's going to be happening.\n\n230\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.800\nWhat can we use forms for?\n\n231\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.710\nWe can use forms for data entry, and\nthat's what we want to start off with\n\n232\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.760\nbasically right here inside of\nour access essentials, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.370\nCan we use forms to update records?\n\n234\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:29.960\nYes.\n\n235\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.430\nCan you use forms to delete records?\n\n236\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.530\nAbsolutely.\n\n237\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.220\nAll that can be done, but it can't\njust be done by you creating a form.\n\n238\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.840\nThere still has to be other things\nthat have to be added in, and\n\n239\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.710\nwe'll talk about those things\nas we go along here, okay?\n\n240\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.510\nBut if we create forms, we wanna begin\n\n241\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.470\nby making sure that we click on\nthe Create tab up here at the top.\n\n242\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.760\nAnd now notice, we're moving from\nour Tables to our Queries and\n\n243\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.530\nnext to the Forms grouping right here,\nokay?\n\n244\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.820\nSo this one can be a little bit tricky,\nand we're gonna go through pretty much\n\n245\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:08.270\nthe majority of these up here when we\ntake a look at this Form button as well.\n\n246\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.110\nAnd the Form Design and the Blank and\nthe Form Wizard, of course.\n\n247\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.360\nLike everything else,\nMicrosoft has this nice wizard\n\n248\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.033\nthat helps us to be able to do some of\nthe things that we really want to do.\n\n249\n00:13:19.033 --> 00:13:23.909\nAnd creating the form right off\nthe bat is one that you may choose and\n\n250\n00:13:23.909 --> 00:13:27.095\ngo let's let the wizard do this for\nus,okay?\n\n251\n00:13:27.095 --> 00:13:30.420\nSo, let's go ahead and show you some\nof the things that might be a little\n\n252\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.980\nbit tricky here, too,\nat the beginning, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.040\nNow that I haven't, let me make sure,\nlet me click off something here for\n\n254\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.650\na moment and see.\n\n255\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.300\nActually, it's gonna let me do it anyways.\n\n256\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.920\nUsually, one of the things as we\nstart to pick up here on forms.\n\n257\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.610\nLet's take a look at this\nForms button right now.\n\n258\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:53.660\nCreate a form that let's you enter\ninformation or one record at a time, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.250\nNotice that we just went\nfrom actually seeing\n\n260\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.710\nall the records at the same time\nto a single record at a time.\n\n261\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:08.280\nNow, in this one, though, you still have\nto kind of figure out what you want to do.\n\n262\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.220\nSo initially,\n\n263\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.910\nthe way that we do it is that we work\nwith the individual tables, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.160\nSo it won't let you do this\nwith a query per se, but\n\n265\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.880\nit will let you do this with a table\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n266\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.790\nSo let me select customers.\n\n267\n00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.080\nNotice I'm not opening customers,\nI'm just selecting it.\n\n268\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.600\nAnd if I select customers,\nI can then click on Forms and\n\n269\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.620\nthere we go,\na form has just popped up, Vonne.\n\n270\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.530\nIt is ready to go, you and\nI are pretty much done.\n\n271\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.015\nSo there goes the end of our show,\nwe are done here.\n\n272\n00:14:41.015 --> 00:14:45.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like, wait,\nbecause you had selected-\n\n273\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.250\n&gt;&gt; I selected the table, right.\n\n274\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:52.360\n&gt;&gt; It basically made a form off of\nevery field that's in that table.\n\n275\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:52.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n276\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.808\n&gt;&gt; And made it into where you\nwould input in the customer ID.\n\n277\n00:14:55.808 --> 00:15:00.556\nIt's taking the field name up at\nthe top and making what I know as\n\n278\n00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:05.410\nsomebody that does forms like an HTML,\nthose are input fields.\n\n279\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what they are.\n\n280\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.988\nAnd the other thing, right, Vonne,\nis since we actually got our table\n\n281\n00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:17.978\ndesign back into where it needs to,\nnotice it also added in a separate,\n\n282\n00:15:17.978 --> 00:15:22.490\nwhat is technically called\na subform down here as well.\n\n283\n00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.150\nThat is because we actually\nhave the customers table and\n\n284\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.840\nthe customer pets table.\n\n285\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.070\nAnd they were in that\nrelationship together.\n\n286\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.880\nI said, if you're gonna be\nupdating the customer's table,\n\n287\n00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.910\nthere's also a possible relationship\ndown here to the pets table.\n\n288\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.030\nSo you probably want to see them together.\n\n289\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.220\nSo Vonne, it read our minds, and\nit was able to do that that quickly.\n\n290\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.870\nWithout you and\nI ever having to make a decision.\n\n291\n00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.850\n&gt;&gt; So that's interesting.\n\n292\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.996\nSo if we did, can we try the sales?\n\n293\n00:15:50.996 --> 00:15:52.980\nCuz I know that sales is\na lot of different ones.\n\n294\n00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.840\nI mean, is that going to show all\nthe other tables and the relationships?\n\n295\n00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.312\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's try and see what happens.\n\n296\n00:15:58.312 --> 00:15:58.949\n&gt;&gt; I'm just curious.\n\n297\n00:15:58.949 --> 00:16:01.638\n[LAUGH] Cuz I know we had\na lot of connections,\n\n298\n00:16:01.638 --> 00:16:04.050\nif you want to say, or relationships.\n\n299\n00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.931\nRelated to the sales table,\nbecause it went and did the products and\n\n300\n00:16:07.931 --> 00:16:09.165\nall sorts of things.\n\n301\n00:16:09.165 --> 00:16:14.593\n&gt;&gt; So let's select Sales this time, and\nthen we will click Create and then Forms.\n\n302\n00:16:14.593 --> 00:16:17.468\nAnd now you will see actually this one,\n\n303\n00:16:17.468 --> 00:16:20.968\nit directly only links\nto the item number here.\n\n304\n00:16:20.968 --> 00:16:24.524\nAnd that is because of where\nit did make this unusual\n\n305\n00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:28.009\nconnection only with\nthe products at this point.\n\n306\n00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:29.946\nNow, it doesn't mean we can't\nconnect the other ones.\n\n307\n00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:33.045\nYou actually can make other sub forums,\nbut\n\n308\n00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:37.239\nthis is the one that feels\nmost closely related to you.\n\n309\n00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.022\n&gt;&gt; It shows their favorite.\n\n310\n00:16:39.022 --> 00:16:40.273\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n\n311\n00:16:40.273 --> 00:16:41.570\nIt essentially shows their favorite.\n\n312\n00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.264\n&gt;&gt; Okay, does it also have something\nto deal with the one to many or\n\n313\n00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:49.028\nlike which ones it kind of I almost\nthink they're like inputs and\n\n314\n00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:50.797\noutputs even though-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n315\n00:16:50.797 --> 00:16:51.788\n&gt;&gt; They're not necessarily that way.\n\n316\n00:16:51.788 --> 00:16:54.477\nBut the one to many or the one to one,\n\n317\n00:16:54.477 --> 00:16:58.795\nthat has maybe something to do\nwith that table it goes in?\n\n318\n00:16:58.795 --> 00:17:00.359\nOr subform, sorry.\n\n319\n00:17:00.359 --> 00:17:01.044\n&gt;&gt; Two point, right, yeah.\n\n320\n00:17:01.044 --> 00:17:05.152\nThe subform is actually the way that it\nactually says where do I actually find\n\n321\n00:17:05.152 --> 00:17:08.634\nthe data that I think that you're\ngoing to need along with this.\n\n322\n00:17:08.634 --> 00:17:13.637\nSo it is making an assumption in the\nbackground that on the sales table, right?\n\n323\n00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:17.081\nYou're probably gonna need\nto also enter in an item.\n\n324\n00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:20.006\nSo it knows how some of this\nworks in the background and\n\n325\n00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:22.938\nit's really neat in terms\nof the navigation as well.\n\n326\n00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:26.066\nIf I start to advance to\none record at a time,\n\n327\n00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:31.323\nnotice it actually does change with\nthe ID and the numbers do change here.\n\n328\n00:17:31.323 --> 00:17:34.392\nI'm trying to get to one where\nthere's actually multiple items here.\n\n329\n00:17:34.392 --> 00:17:39.034\nI'm assuming that there's actually one,\nat least up into this point there is it.\n\n330\n00:17:39.034 --> 00:17:40.436\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:17:40.436 --> 00:17:41.969\n&gt;&gt; But it could be actually only showing\n\n332\n00:17:41.969 --> 00:17:45.223\njust a few there\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're trying to get-\n\n333\n00:17:45.223 --> 00:17:45.746\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n334\n00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:48.212\n&gt;&gt; To where if like,\nhow the relationships of the data of that-\n\n335\n00:17:48.212 --> 00:17:48.848\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n336\n00:17:48.848 --> 00:17:49.487\n&gt;&gt; Subform.\n\n337\n00:17:49.487 --> 00:17:52.591\nIt could show other things\nbesides to that single-\n\n338\n00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.105\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n339\n00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.085\n&gt;&gt; Record.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n340\n00:17:54.085 --> 00:17:55.671\n&gt;&gt; For that one.\n\n341\n00:17:55.671 --> 00:17:57.473\n&gt;&gt; And on this point,\nI don't wanna continue to go, but\n\n342\n00:17:57.473 --> 00:17:58.965\nit probably show up in\nthe few minutes here.\n\n343\n00:17:58.965 --> 00:17:59.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unless\n\n344\n00:17:59.908 --> 00:18:01.369\nit's only showing up\nthe first one right now.\n\n345\n00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:01.947\nAnd if it is,\n\n346\n00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:05.058\nit means I probably didn't link all\nthe data the way that we needed to.\n\n347\n00:18:05.058 --> 00:18:05.933\nBut over all though,\n\n348\n00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:09.197\nyou're actually starting to see as we\ncontinue to work through these records.\n\n349\n00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:12.767\nIt will at least begin to show those\nup in terms of the item numbers.\n\n350\n00:18:12.767 --> 00:18:17.007\nAnd what I didn't actually matchup\nis in maybe in doing it, but\n\n351\n00:18:17.007 --> 00:18:20.850\none record at a time here on\neach of the sales IDs instead.\n\n352\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.090\nSo may not actually be grouping\nthem together the way that I think\n\n353\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.816\nit should be.\n\n354\n00:18:24.816 --> 00:18:28.768\n&gt;&gt; Is this another indication of\nwhere we might need to go back and\n\n355\n00:18:28.768 --> 00:18:30.592\nlook at some of our?\n\n356\n00:18:30.592 --> 00:18:33.478\nNot necessarily right now, but-\n&gt;&gt; It's not really that, right?\n\n357\n00:18:33.478 --> 00:18:35.366\nIt's the way that is entered in,\n\n358\n00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:39.016\nthat it didn't the group information\nunderneath the sales ID.\n\n359\n00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:43.782\nSo like 1098 could have actually\ngone by like ten times already.\n\n360\n00:18:43.782 --> 00:18:46.885\nBut each one is actually inly\nshowing up once down here,\n\n361\n00:18:46.885 --> 00:18:50.130\nform the way that we actually\nhave the data entry going on.\n\n362\n00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.960\nSo it doesn't mean that it's\nautomatically gonna do that,\n\n363\n00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.621\nit means that we have to actually check\nthat relationship between that form and\n\n364\n00:18:56.621 --> 00:18:58.295\nthat subform as it happens, okay?\n\n365\n00:18:58.295 --> 00:19:03.966\nSo Vonne brings up a good point about\nthis particular way creating formzen.\n\n366\n00:19:03.966 --> 00:19:08.959\nIf you don't know what is supposed to show\nup, it may kind of throw you a little bit.\n\n367\n00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:13.706\nSo we've still got a few more to go\nthrough, but so what I'm saying is we\n\n368\n00:19:13.706 --> 00:19:18.234\nmight have actually run across sales\nID two or three times already.\n\n369\n00:19:18.234 --> 00:19:22.323\nAnd each one only really had that\none item number listed in them, but\n\n370\n00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:26.711\nit does mean that 1098 did actually\ncombine multiple items, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:30.834\nBut in the way that the subform is showing\nup, it was not showing up as 1098 and\n\n372\n00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:33.514\nthen the three different\nones that are here, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:33.514 --> 00:19:36.529\nNow, the other one though\nactually would do this.\n\n374\n00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:38.644\nLet me go back to the one\nthat we just created.\n\n375\n00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:43.360\nLet me not save the changes here, and\nlet's select that customers table again.\n\n376\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.103\nSelect Create and\nwe'll pull up the forms again here.\n\n377\n00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:52.830\nNow this one I know, cuz I actually\ndid go through it a time or two here.\n\n378\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.206\nAnd we'll actually see that, let me see,\n\n379\n00:19:55.206 --> 00:19:59.232\nI know that there is a customer named\nMichelle something I think, West.\n\n380\n00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:04.014\n&gt;&gt; Or that will have multiple pets.\n\n381\n00:20:04.014 --> 00:20:04.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n382\n00:20:04.895 --> 00:20:05.733\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n383\n00:20:05.733 --> 00:20:09.325\ncuz I know there's a couple that\nI made multiple pets in there.\n\n384\n00:20:09.325 --> 00:20:12.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Michelle West and\nyou can see it right here Michelle West.\n\n385\n00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:15.944\nAnd on this one though that\nrelationship did show up that way,\n\n386\n00:20:15.944 --> 00:20:18.280\nthe way that I expected it to show up.\n\n387\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.332\nWhereas the other one like I said,\nI may not actually know, but\n\n388\n00:20:22.332 --> 00:20:25.635\nthat 1098, in terms of sales ID and 1099.\n\n389\n00:20:25.635 --> 00:20:29.025\nIt could have actually all been\nlinked to that one customer number,\n\n390\n00:20:29.025 --> 00:20:30.399\nis what I should have said.\n\n391\n00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:33.205\nI think I said sales ID, sales ID\nshould have only appeared one time.\n\n392\n00:20:33.205 --> 00:20:35.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I also threw you for\na loop, but do-\n\n393\n00:20:35.793 --> 00:20:36.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fine.\n\n394\n00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:38.712\n&gt;&gt; Something else that you\ndidn't plan on doing just yet.\n\n395\n00:20:38.712 --> 00:20:39.226\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n396\n00:20:39.226 --> 00:20:39.884\n&gt;&gt; That's my bad.\n\n397\n00:20:39.884 --> 00:20:41.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n398\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.069\nthat's what we're ending up seeing here.\n\n399\n00:20:43.069 --> 00:20:47.386\nThe very fact is, as we start to see this,\nit is already starting to say hey,\n\n400\n00:20:47.386 --> 00:20:49.420\nhere's what can be done.\n\n401\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.946\nSo now if we wanted to Vonne,\neven from right here,\n\n402\n00:20:52.946 --> 00:20:56.150\nI could enter in a new dog name,\nif I wanted to.\n\n403\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.739\nI could update and\nchange this information, and\n\n404\n00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:01.590\nI don't have to worry about\nhitting the Save button.\n\n405\n00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.076\nAll I have to do is move\non to another record, okay?\n\n406\n00:21:04.076 --> 00:21:08.201\nAnd then the data is automatically\nsaved when we do that, okay?\n\n407\n00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:12.200\nSo it can be done this quickly, but\nnotice that we don't really have\n\n408\n00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.160\nany control in how the form\nwas essentially made.\n\n409\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.620\nWe don't get to pick and\nchoose what fields that we have.\n\n410\n00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.548\nWe just kind of go, all right, here it is.\n\n411\n00:21:19.548 --> 00:21:23.718\n&gt;&gt; This is almost in this sense of\nwhere you just click that one button,\n\n412\n00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:27.590\nyou're getting access to every\nsingle thing in the table.\n\n413\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.130\nAnd if you start changing primary keys or\nanything like that,\n\n414\n00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.970\nthis is kind of going back to well that's\ngreat as like maybe a starting point.\n\n415\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.960\nAnd then we might want to take this and\nthen manipulate from this point.\n\n416\n00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.708\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n417\n00:21:40.708 --> 00:21:43.338\n&gt;&gt; Or start from scratch,\nif you wanna say, or\n\n418\n00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:45.978\nsome other way of getting\nto the same place.\n\n419\n00:21:45.978 --> 00:21:50.092\nBut at least it gives you everything\nall in one place and you go from there.\n\n420\n00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:52.407\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nit is nice when you start doing that, but\n\n421\n00:21:52.407 --> 00:21:56.340\nthen when you start changing it and you're\nnot sure how that change ends up working.\n\n422\n00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:02.440\nIt begins to get a little bit more unusual\nfor all the things that you have to do.\n\n423\n00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.718\nBut at least you can see at this point\nthat one form if you don't really care\n\n424\n00:22:06.718 --> 00:22:08.521\nabout the formatting so much.\n\n425\n00:22:08.521 --> 00:22:11.260\nAnd you just care about it\nactually putting it together,\n\n426\n00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.751\nthis is probably the way to go.\n\n427\n00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:14.766\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI can see up there on the ribbon.\n\n428\n00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:17.994\nLike once you were in a forms,\nI can see like the design and\n\n429\n00:22:17.994 --> 00:22:20.426\nsee all those different buttons up there.\n\n430\n00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.191\nI know you're gonna get to it-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n431\n00:22:22.191 --> 00:22:24.869\n&gt;&gt; But for me being something\nthat knows about forms like\n\n432\n00:22:24.869 --> 00:22:26.465\nI can see there's an input field.\n\n433\n00:22:26.465 --> 00:22:30.463\nThere's gonna be a drop down menu,\nthere's gonna be different check boxes,\n\n434\n00:22:30.463 --> 00:22:31.319\nradio buttons.\n\n435\n00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:33.812\nAll those different ones\nthat you can start changing.\n\n436\n00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:38.944\nWhat type of form fields that you\ncan use to be able to put that in.\n\n437\n00:22:38.944 --> 00:22:40.914\nYou can see that they arrange the format-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n438\n00:22:40.914 --> 00:22:41.525\n&gt;&gt; Tab as well.\n\n439\n00:22:41.525 --> 00:22:48.140\nThat's coming up that we can start\nto move and manipulate from here.\n\n440\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.288\nBut I know we'll get-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n441\n00:22:49.288 --> 00:22:50.316\n&gt;&gt; Into that, but I just point that out.\n\n442\n00:22:50.316 --> 00:22:52.251\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna get into a little\nbit of that as we go on.\n\n443\n00:22:52.251 --> 00:22:57.543\nI'll let Vonne kind of get into the making\nit better looking than what I do.\n\n444\n00:22:57.543 --> 00:23:03.009\nI'm a simple guy, I just need the fields\non the screen and I'm ready to go.\n\n445\n00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:05.509\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if your company says,\n\n446\n00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.975\nhere's how to stylistically which\ncan't say, has actually looked like.\n\n447\n00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:13.369\nThen yes,\nyou should avail yourself of these\n\n448\n00:23:13.369 --> 00:23:18.025\ntools that are available to kind\nof help you out to do this too.\n\n449\n00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:20.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz these are just items if you wanna say,\n\n450\n00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:24.042\nif you've done any type of work\nin some other Microsoft products,\n\n451\n00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:26.567\nI almost said Adobe products\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n452\n00:23:26.567 --> 00:23:27.568\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Totally wrong way.\n\n453\n00:23:27.568 --> 00:23:30.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you're like in PowerPoint and\n\n454\n00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:34.587\nyou wanna like align two squares,\nI mean this form fields are squares.\n\n455\n00:23:34.587 --> 00:23:37.729\nAnd so if you really wanted to get into\nthe nitty gritty of kind of moving\n\n456\n00:23:37.729 --> 00:23:38.481\nthings around.\n\n457\n00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:42.335\nWhich we're not necessarily going to\nhave full episodes covering just that\n\n458\n00:23:42.335 --> 00:23:43.367\nparticular stuff.\n\n459\n00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:47.903\nBut like you said, this is just kind\nof getting started, get the stuff in,\n\n460\n00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:51.500\nand we're gonna cover the basics\nof how to do the form.\n\n461\n00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that\nthere's plenty of different ones to\n\n462\n00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.740\nactually take a look at here.\n\n463\n00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:02.085\nSo on this one, that's kinda the fast and\nfurious way to create a form.\n\n464\n00:24:02.085 --> 00:24:06.010\nBut just make sure it actually serves\nthe purpose that you need it to serve.\n\n465\n00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.310\nIf you're gonna do this for\ndata entry, more than likely,\n\n466\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.942\nyou're gonna create a different form for\neach one of those tables.\n\n467\n00:24:10.942 --> 00:24:14.995\nSo that you can enter the data in\nthe way that you want to, okay?\n\n468\n00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.579\nBut when you do that, right?\n\n469\n00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:19.195\nIt becomes a little bit\nmore messy in terms of you,\n\n470\n00:24:19.195 --> 00:24:22.578\nI can't believe I had to create\n16 different forms to do that.\n\n471\n00:24:22.578 --> 00:24:26.179\nYou don't really have to do that,\nbecause another way for\n\n472\n00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:28.170\nus to do this if we will trust it.\n\n473\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.863\nWe're gonna leave these kind of last here,\n\n474\n00:24:29.863 --> 00:24:32.240\nbecause these are the manual\nones a little bit more.\n\n475\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.145\nWe're going to head into the one\nthat we all love here, right?\n\n476\n00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:38.738\nThe idea of using this wizard is\nthe one that we want to be able to do.\n\n477\n00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:40.858\nSo if I just select on the forms wizard,\n\n478\n00:24:40.858 --> 00:24:45.115\nnotice it looks very similar to the other\nthings that we've been doing Vonne.\n\n479\n00:24:45.115 --> 00:24:48.569\nIn terms of the table,\nno actually, the query wizard.\n\n480\n00:24:48.569 --> 00:24:50.323\nI was trying to remember here.\n\n481\n00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:54.660\nThe query wizard as well,\nwe can pick and choose.\n\n482\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.900\nAnd look once again Vonne,\nthis is where it gets neater.\n\n483\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.352\nNotice we can pick and\nchoose between queries and tables, okay?\n\n484\n00:25:01.352 --> 00:25:04.664\nAnd this is actually kind of neat here,\nwhen we do this.\n\n485\n00:25:04.664 --> 00:25:08.490\nSo let's just pick the customer\ntable again that we want, and\n\n486\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.929\nI'm just gonna pull in all the fields.\n\n487\n00:25:10.929 --> 00:25:14.754\nOf course, the ones that I don't want\nto actually be able to address here,\n\n488\n00:25:14.754 --> 00:25:15.859\nI simply select one.\n\n489\n00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:20.030\nI can use the left arrow, leave that over\nthe available fields and we're going.\n\n490\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.934\nNow I want us to actually stop, cuz we'll\nrun through each one of these here Vonne.\n\n491\n00:25:24.934 --> 00:25:29.520\nBecause this is where it gets a little\nbit confusing when you don't see it, and\n\n492\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.154\nyou go okay, this displays\neverything in the column, okay?\n\n493\n00:25:33.154 --> 00:25:35.828\nThis displays everything in,\nyou understand that.\n\n494\n00:25:35.828 --> 00:25:38.516\nBut we wanna take a look\nat each one of these Vonne,\n\n495\n00:25:38.516 --> 00:25:42.812\nbecause it is important depending on the\nway that you want to enter your data in.\n\n496\n00:25:42.812 --> 00:25:46.720\nAnd what it is that you're hoping\nthat somebody else is also gonna see.\n\n497\n00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.720\nAnd it's gonna actually help you in your\nworkflow, if you choose the right one.\n\n498\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.139\nBut we're gonna create one of these in the\nsame exact report in each one of these, so\n\n499\n00:25:54.139 --> 00:25:56.616\nthat we can understand\nwhat's going on here.\n\n500\n00:25:56.616 --> 00:26:00.363\nBut Vonne, I have talked once again so\nmuch that we do need\n\n501\n00:26:00.363 --> 00:26:05.020\nto actually kind of cut this one at\nthis point and move into a part two.\n\n502\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.601\n&gt;&gt; Do I feel another mini\nseries coming on here, Ronnie?\n\n503\n00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:08.138\n&gt;&gt; It's possible.\n\n504\n00:26:08.138 --> 00:26:10.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well that sounds like fun.\n\n505\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.241\nSo I'm glad that we've got a nice\n\n506\n00:26:12.241 --> 00:26:13.476\nbaseline-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n507\n00:26:13.476 --> 00:26:14.571\n&gt;&gt; As to why we need to use forms.\n\n508\n00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:15.970\nWe've gone over some of the very,\n\n509\n00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.341\nvery basics which is always\ngood to start our foundation.\n\n510\n00:26:18.341 --> 00:26:22.705\nGet the mini series going, get you\ninterested and then pull you back for\n\n511\n00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:23.364\na-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n512\n00:26:23.364 --> 00:26:25.651\n&gt;&gt; Part two where we go ahead and\ngo through that form wizard.\n\n513\n00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:26.764\nSo thank you so much for that.\n\n514\n00:26:26.764 --> 00:26:28.897\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this episode.\n\n515\n00:26:28.897 --> 00:26:32.596\nSigning off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n516\n00:26:32.596 --> 00:26:33.459\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:26:33.459 --> 00:26:34.306\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you real soon.\n\n518\n00:26:34.306 --> 00:26:39.682\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.400\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.660\nwe are continuing on with our\nAccess 2016 Essentials show.\n\n5\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.422\nAnd this is our part two of our lovely\nlittle forms mini series that we've\n\n6\n00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:27.680\ngot going on here.\n\n7\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.865\nAnd back in his leading role is Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.553\nHello, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:34.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine, Vonne,\n\n10\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.280\nthank you again for\nhaving me back at Office Pro here,\n\n11\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.180\nas we continue to take a look of course\nabout why we use forms and creating forms.\n\n12\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.630\nIn the previous episode we had left\noff by teasing you just a little bit\n\n13\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.340\nabout using the actual form wizard.\n\n14\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.770\nThat's where we wanna pick up.\n\n15\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Just like every good mini series,\n\n16\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010\nyou gotta have a little\ncliffhanger at the end.\n\n17\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.570\nThat's why you're such the greatest\nleading man in the mini series role.\n\n18\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.615\nI think you deserve an Emmy, Ronnie.\n\n19\n00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:02.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n20\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.812\nthat would be the saddest\nEmmy in the world.\n\n21\n00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:07.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But hey,\n\n22\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.005\nI'll take what I can get.\n\n23\n00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:08.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here we are,\n\n24\n00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:13.470\nwe are taking a look at of course\nthe form wizard, I should say.\n\n25\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.000\nAnd what we had talked about and\nwhy we would choose to use this.\n\n26\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.080\nForm wizard is by far going\nto be the most intuitive\n\n27\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.150\ntype of tool that we can use\nto create a form for us.\n\n28\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.580\nAnd it really does display for us as\nmany different options as we have, and\n\n29\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.550\nit really sets everything up nicely.\n\n30\n00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.830\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in as\nwe start to take a look at this again.\n\n31\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.210\nSo in the previous episode I\nkind of just went ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.940\nclicked on the Form Wizard button\nwhich is right up here at the top.\n\n33\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.090\nAnd there I've zoomed out a little bit.\n\n34\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.350\nAnd here in the Form Wizard I pointed\nout a couple of different things,\n\n35\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.420\nwhich is we can query from\ntables as well as queries.\n\n36\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.600\nRight now we're just gonna select a table\nat this point as what we're going to do.\n\n37\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.575\n&gt;&gt; Can I ask a, maybe a silly question.\n\n38\n00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.307\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n39\n00:01:58.307 --> 00:01:59.639\n&gt;&gt; With the queries,\n\n40\n00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:05.390\ncuz we're talking about forms as a way\nof controlling how to input information.\n\n41\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So would we be inputting\n\n42\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.265\ninto the query result the record set?\n\n43\n00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:16.625\nI guess I'm not fully understanding\nthe query part of using forms.\n\n44\n00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, and\nit actually makes sense, right.\n\n45\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.410\nSo the good question that you have there\nis what are we actually doing when\n\n46\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.030\nwe start to actually make\na form based off a query.\n\n47\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.780\nWell, remember that what\nwe're really querying for\n\n48\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.960\nare what, well,\nthe actual fields in the tables.\n\n49\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.820\nSo the query itself is just generating for\n\n50\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.100\nus those fields that we would normally\nstill see, just like a regular form.\n\n51\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.140\nSo if I select this one,\nnotice the link here, though, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.150\nWhat I've just done instead is I've\nlimited myself to those fields instead.\n\n53\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.018\nWhereas if I select a table, okay,\nI can limit myself to certain fields but\n\n54\n00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:55.588\nI still have to actually go\nthrough that table to do so.\n\n55\n00:02:55.588 --> 00:02:59.943\nNow with a query, if I query multiple\ntables I can select the fields that\n\n56\n00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:03.700\nI really am trying to actually\nupdate from multiple tables.\n\n57\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.030\nAnd be able to use that in\na form all at one time,\n\n58\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.410\nwhich is what I would really\nrecommend in the end.\n\n59\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.318\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so okay, I think I got it.\n\n60\n00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:13.057\nLet me see if I'm saying this correctly.\n\n61\n00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:16.213\n&gt;&gt; Sure, sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz a query really is connected to\n\n62\n00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:17.490\na table.\n\n63\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.310\nSo if we're doing a form we're asking for\n\n64\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.210\nthe field within the query but\nit's connected to the table.\n\n65\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.257\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're still going to be modifying\n\n66\n00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:33.221\nthe record in the table that\nthe query is connected to.\n\n67\n00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.019\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n68\n00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.374\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I got it now.\n\n69\n00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:39.658\nIt's just more of a filtered.\n\n70\n00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:40.590\nI'll use that word.\n\n71\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.401\n&gt;&gt; No that's actually a good way.\n\n72\n00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:43.880\n&gt;&gt; Like the filtered fields\nthat I want to get out of it.\n\n73\n00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, and actually that's\nwhat I do recommend in the end.\n\n74\n00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.748\nNow I don't recommend right\nnow as a beginner, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:55.238\nBut once you get to that point\nwhere you feel comfortable in your\n\n76\n00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:59.090\ndatabase design and\nin working with queries.\n\n77\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.600\nCreating a form based off of\nthe query itself is really helpful\n\n78\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.210\nbecause now you're not going,\ndo I need to update that one or that one?\n\n79\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.820\nIf you can run a query and say,\nhere's what I need to update, and\n\n80\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.230\nyou pull that from two or\nthree different tables.\n\n81\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.569\nNow you have actually filtered out all of\nthe other stuff that you didn't want to\n\n82\n00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.784\nactually have to worry about updating.\n\n83\n00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:23.820\nAnd you can now actually just create\na form based off of that filtered data.\n\n84\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, for\nsome reason, I don't know.\n\n85\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.150\nMaybe because it's Monday,\nI know It doesn't matter for\n\n86\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.080\nyou guys when you're watching a recording,\nwhether it's a Monday or not.\n\n87\n00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.910\nBut I kind of forgot\nthe key concept of that\n\n88\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.750\nthe query is a question of the tables.\n\n89\n00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.350\nSo it all connects.\n\n90\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.169\nI was thinking of the record set,\nlike the result, and\n\n91\n00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.962\nyou would be changing the result.\n\n92\n00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:46.690\nAnd I'm like wait,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n93\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.124\nSo I got a little twisted on there,\nso thank you for explaining.\n\n94\n00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.310\n&gt;&gt; No, and it does make sense, right?\n\n95\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.820\nBut remember when we run a query the\nrecord set is not saved in itself, right?\n\n96\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.630\nThe only thing that we've actually saved\nis the query, which means the record set\n\n97\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.350\nis generated dynamically on\nthe fly as we run that query.\n\n98\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.460\nSo there's nothing that we can\nactually update from a query.\n\n99\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.692\nThe records that only exist if we run\nthe query, so that's what happens here.\n\n100\n00:05:10.692 --> 00:05:14.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, those key concepts,\nkey definitions, and\n\n101\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.020\nit just kind of,\nnow I'm back in the game, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.264\nI had to go back and like,\nin our mini series, and like,\n\n103\n00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:25.910\nwhat happened on that one episode, as I\ntalk into my little remote or whatever.\n\n104\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.638\nLike, go back 45 days.\n\n105\n00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:29.300\nOr however many days [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n106\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.589\nI can remind myself of what we're\nactually doing here on the show [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nno I do the same thing sometimes.\n\n108\n00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.235\nBecause it's actually kind of difficult\nto remember all these different things\n\n109\n00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:41.990\ncuz there's a lot of different parts\nin this especially on the database.\n\n110\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.650\nSo here's where we stopped\nlast time in the show.\n\n111\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.110\nWhat layout, and\nthis is the key here, okay.\n\n112\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.120\nThe idea of actually choosing\na layout is really dependent upon\n\n113\n00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.550\nhow your workflow is ordered\nin terms of what you need.\n\n114\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.050\nSo I want us to take a look\nat each one of these.\n\n115\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.990\nAnd the reason why is that I\nfound this confusing myself\n\n116\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.470\nas I first started making different forms.\n\n117\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.570\nAnd why would I choose one over the other?\n\n118\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.030\nWell, it doesn't really help if you\nonly continue to choose one and\n\n119\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.000\nyou never choose the other\nto take a look at them.\n\n120\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.940\nSo this is a great time for us to be able\nto take a look and explain each of these.\n\n121\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.030\nAnd that makes it a little bit easier.\n\n122\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.140\nSo I'm gonna choose this columnar\none at the very beginning.\n\n123\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.510\nAnd of course we'll take a look\nat tabular, datasheet, and\n\n124\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.540\njustified in just a moment as well.\n\n125\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.200\nSo I'm going to click Next here.\n\n126\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.270\nAnd then it's gonna ask what\nI want to name this form.\n\n127\n00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.240\nSo for this one,\nI'm just gonna make it simple here, and\n\n128\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.880\nI'm gonna use our prefix\nnotation that we've been using.\n\n129\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.938\nAnd for access and\nthe prefix reforms, it's frm.\n\n130\n00:06:43.938 --> 00:06:44.917\nAnd it's strange, Vonne.\n\n131\n00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:47.790\nRemember when we saw the sub-form\na little bit earlier?\n\n132\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.790\nYou would think that a sub form\nwould be like sfrm, right, subform.\n\n133\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.450\nBut it's not,\nit's subf is the actual prefix here for.\n\n134\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.950\nI don't know why,\nthat's just the way it is.\n\n135\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.560\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you just don't ask\nquestions and you just say, okay.\n\n136\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah and that's what you do.\n\n137\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.930\nSo let's go ahead and click Finish here,\nand now you'll see that it went ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.570\ngenerated for us, this.\n\n139\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.860\nNotice it created a title, so\n\n140\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.460\nthis allows you to know you didn't\nactually have to create it this way.\n\n141\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.340\nI wanted to because of\ndemonstration purposes here.\n\n142\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.030\nBut this is where you would put the title\nof your form for whoever it is.\n\n143\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.670\nAnd notice it would also name\nthat form the same thing.\n\n144\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.450\nSo if you wanted this for,\nlet's say, customer update, or\n\n145\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.690\ncustomer entry, you could have\nalso called it that as well, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.610\nNow, when you take a look\nat the idea of columnar,\n\n147\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.930\nnotice that everything\nis in this one column.\n\n148\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.892\nSo it does make sense\nwhen you see what it did.\n\n149\n00:07:47.892 --> 00:07:50.374\nWe of course have labels\nover here on the side.\n\n150\n00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:53.278\nAnd we have each of the fields\nbeing represented over\n\n151\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:56.451\nhere in a separate column,\nnotice two columns, right?\n\n152\n00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:57.094\nA column for\n\n153\n00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:01.084\nall of the labels and then a column for\nthe data entry that we're gonna do.\n\n154\n00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:05.663\nThen I can use the navigation, I'm gonna\nzoom in as I did this a little bit,\n\n155\n00:08:05.663 --> 00:08:08.930\nI can use the navigation and\nnavigate through them.\n\n156\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.730\nIf I want to create a new record,\nI simply create this new\n\n157\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.040\nblank record right here and then it\nwould actually allow us to do this.\n\n158\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.450\nNow I do want to actually kind of give you\n\n159\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.230\na little bit of a tentative pause here for\nmoment, okay.\n\n160\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.760\nYou cannot skip this customer ID\nfield because that's our primary key.\n\n161\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.070\nAnd the reason why this is important\nIs that when you go on and\n\n162\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.380\nyou close out of this, even if you\ndon't enter in anything else and\n\n163\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.950\nit doesn't accept the primary\nkey it's going to warn you.\n\n164\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.350\nSo let me do this, let me do a duplicate.\n\n165\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.810\nI know there is a duplicate of 22 here.\n\n166\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.450\nI say hey I want to close this thing out.\n\n167\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.210\nIt says,\nhey do you want to save the changes?\n\n168\n00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.450\nI say yes.\n\n169\n00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.460\nAnd now it gives me this warning, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.380\nThe changes you requested to the table\nwere not successful because you would\n\n171\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.590\ncreate a duplicate value in the index\nprimary key or relationship.\n\n172\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.410\nChange the data in the fields that\ncontained the duplicate, remove the index,\n\n173\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:11.080\nor redefine the index to permit\nduplicate entries and try again.\n\n174\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.960\nWell, notice now it says you cannot\nsave this at this particular time.\n\n175\n00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.010\nAre you sure you want\nto close this object?\n\n176\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.390\nClick Yes, and\nhopefully everything closes out.\n\n177\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.670\nSometimes you might find out\nthat it doesn't close out.\n\n178\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.880\nYou've already entered data in, and\nnow you try and close it out and\n\n179\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.700\nit says, you've gotta actually\nfix this before you can go on.\n\n180\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.796\nAnd this is where people will start\nupdating randomly things just so\n\n181\n00:09:36.796 --> 00:09:38.682\nthat they can get through this.\n\n182\n00:09:38.682 --> 00:09:41.540\nSo we'll put a fake record in so\nthat they can get through.\n\n183\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.580\nAnd then in the end they'll have to open\nit back up to try and delete that fake\n\n184\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.380\nrecord out of there and try and\nmake sure everything actually works again.\n\n185\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.060\nBut just kind of realize that\nbefore you move on there.\n\n186\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.130\nEspecially if you know that you are gonna\nbe updating that primary key field,\n\n187\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.950\nyou need to make sure that you are gonna\nput in a primary key that's not gonna be\n\n188\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.980\nduplicated again.\n\n189\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.090\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is\ngetting too far ahead or\n\n190\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.610\nputting the cart before the horse,\nor whatever.\n\n191\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.112\nI always say those things wrong,\nand Daniel loves to correct me.\n\n192\n00:10:07.112 --> 00:10:13.180\n[LAUGH] But, can you make that like\nan auto-generated fIeld to where it would\n\n193\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.790\njust automatically make the next number in\nthat record or is that too complicated?\n\n194\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.430\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit complicated to\nactually be able to do that.\n\n195\n00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.290\nThere are ways to do this, but you're\npretty much asking it to go through that\n\n196\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.260\nentire list and say,\nfind me one that's not in this list,\n\n197\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.193\nwhich is a tremendous amount of data\nthat it has to actually go through.\n\n198\n00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:38.850\nOr you can try to tell it to say, look at\nthe last record and then do a plus one, so\n\n199\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.830\nit actually has to be a function\nto do stuff like that.\n\n200\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.440\nCan it be done?\n\n201\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.490\nYes.\n\n202\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm already thinking of for loops\nand everything that goes, I was like,\n\n203\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.450\nI don't know if I should ask, I felt\nlike it was way out of the scope but it-\n\n204\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.000\n&gt;&gt; But yes-\n\n205\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.910\n&gt;&gt; It's possible, but it's-\n\n206\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.890\n&gt;&gt; It is possible, but\n\n207\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.990\nwe're probably not gonna\nbe doing that right now.\n\n208\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.254\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] okay.\n\n209\n00:10:57.254 --> 00:11:01.540\n&gt;&gt; So this actually does give us at\nleast a hint of what we might see.\n\n210\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.470\nAnd the reason why I'm pointing that out\nis because we're not gonna be able to show\n\n211\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.360\nyou everything that we can\ndo in forms all at one time.\n\n212\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.110\nSo that one is actually something that\nyou do work on where you click next,\n\n213\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.670\nand you tell it populate the primary, the\nnext available primary key or whatever, or\n\n214\n00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.520\nplus one on the last record,\nor whatever it is.\n\n215\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.490\nIt begins to become a little bit\nmore tricky, but it can be done and\n\n216\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.420\nthat's probably for\nmore advanced stuff as we go through this.\n\n217\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.300\nAll right, so\nlet's run that create wizard again.\n\n218\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.240\nNow that you've seen that,\n\n219\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.170\nlet me run through the form wizard\na little bit quicker this time.\n\n220\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:39.100\nAnd we'll select the same exact one,\nthis time we'll select tabular here, okay?\n\n221\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.147\nSo in that other one it's very easy as\nlong as everything is setup the way\n\n222\n00:11:43.147 --> 00:11:44.168\nthat you want to.\n\n223\n00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:47.324\nAnd then we'll come down here and\n\n224\n00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:52.401\nwe'll do this form frm_tabular,\nif I can spell it.\n\n225\n00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:55.934\nSo that's all I have done is\njust change the spelling and\n\n226\n00:11:55.934 --> 00:12:00.480\nclick Finish and now notice this\nis a little bit different, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.770\nLooks almost like the data sheet here but\nnotice the amount of spacing and\n\n228\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.430\nnow you can see more than\na single record at a time for\n\n229\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.420\nus to be able to enter data in as well,\nokay?\n\n230\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.980\nSo it does give you that\nability to be able to do this.\n\n231\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.850\nNow the spacing might be important,\nespecially if you are gonna be typing this\n\n232\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.990\nstuff in, and just manually trying to\ngo through it as quickly as you can.\n\n233\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.990\nYou can do this, so there's another\nformat that you may choose, but\n\n234\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.670\nI just wanted to show you.\n\n235\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.680\nSo the first one was columns, right?\n\n236\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.090\nThis one is if you're actually kind of\ntabbing over, doing that kind of stuff,\n\n237\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.400\nit will also help you out too, right?\n\n238\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.750\nLets go through the last\ntwo here relatively quickly\n\n239\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.500\nnow that you understand what\nit is I'm trying to show you.\n\n240\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.230\nIt makes a little bit more sense but it\ndoesn't make sense if you don't actually\n\n241\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.290\nsee it and you're trying to pick out which\nones so that's why we're doing this.\n\n242\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.850\nThis time I'm gonna\nselect data sheet view,\n\n243\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.180\nthis is probably what\nwe're more familiar with.\n\n244\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.880\nNotice the difference when we do this one,\nand I'm just gonna change this prefix\n\n245\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:07.340\nagain, frm_datasheet and click Finish.\n\n246\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.960\nThis is probably what we were\nexpecting to see instead, okay.\n\n247\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.550\nSo this is more traditional but\n\n248\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.480\nthis one requires a little bit more\ncare as you start clicking on fields.\n\n249\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.330\nEven though they give you the nice kind\nof bonded color stripes here as you\n\n250\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.530\ngo across,\nit still is more spreadsheet like than.\n\n251\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.300\nAnd most of us are probably more familiar\nwith working in something like this.\n\n252\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.120\nYou might be going, why don't I\njust update the actual table then.\n\n253\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.630\nYou're right,\nwhy not update the actual table\n\n254\n00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.880\nif you're gonna use something\nlike this as well, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.740\nCuz it's showing you just about everything\nthat the table is showing you anyways.\n\n256\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.120\nSo, but they do give you that ability\nto create one if you want to.\n\n257\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.089\nAnd then we'll take a look at this last\none here in the form wizard as far as\n\n258\n00:13:52.089 --> 00:13:53.897\nthe different styles go.\n\n259\n00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:58.446\nI wanna show you this exact same data so\nthat you don't kind of go,\n\n260\n00:13:58.446 --> 00:14:02.350\nwell I don't know, you know,\nwhat's that all about.\n\n261\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.070\nBut this one is the one that I don't like.\n\n262\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:11.030\nAt one point I might have actually\nchosen this way back in my 20s or so.\n\n263\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.260\nI might've chosen this.\n\n264\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.490\nBut justified is exactly\nlike it sounds like.\n\n265\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.160\nEach of the fields is actually\nextended out to the margins.\n\n266\n00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.278\nAll justified here, all right justified.\n\n267\n00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:30.000\nClick Finish, and\nthis is actually the width of that form.\n\n268\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.990\nAnd notice how the labels are actually\nextended all the way out.\n\n269\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.360\nNotice the field right next\nto it is extended out.\n\n270\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.490\nEdge to edge is what we see here.\n\n271\n00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.920\nNow, I would not choose this for\nmyself, but\n\n272\n00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.240\nsomeone that really has worked with forms\nthat are in this particular fashion,\n\n273\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.420\nthey may be the ones to chose\nsomething like this instead.\n\n274\n00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.718\nSo each one of those are just different\nways that the actual wizard helps\n\n275\n00:14:55.718 --> 00:15:01.294\nus to be able to create simple basic\nforms that are very utilitarian for us.\n\n276\n00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:04.845\nBut they will work,\nthey will allow us to do what we need to,\n\n277\n00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:06.780\nto be able to get access into it.\n\n278\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.270\nNow, it's not fancy but they do allow\nus to at least give a little bit\n\n279\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.330\nof control as we work through those, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.657\nNow that by far as we start\nto think about it, right?\n\n281\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.860\nSo you might choose one and\nfrom that point you start to modify.\n\n282\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.170\nAs different as they are from what\nyour original vision is for a form,\n\n283\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.330\nthat's when you have to kind of go, is\nit worth modifying, is it too much time?\n\n284\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.380\nThat's what you have to decide\non at that point, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.330\nBut the great thing is that\nwizard will ensure that you do,\n\n286\n00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.680\nat least get something to actually do\nsome data entry the way that you want to.\n\n287\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.790\nAnd you can use the query with it,\n\n288\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.010\nit will give you the filter results\nlike what Vonne was saying as well.\n\n289\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.044\nTo actually only show you the fields\nthat you want to actually have someone\n\n290\n00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:49.773\nenter in to.\n\n291\n00:15:49.773 --> 00:15:53.900\nAll right, so that brings us to\na couple of the other ones here.\n\n292\n00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.462\nAnd this is actually kind\nof a neat one as well.\n\n293\n00:15:57.462 --> 00:16:01.930\nWe're gonna talk about these just briefly,\nprobably at the end here.\n\n294\n00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.990\nBut let's talk about these\nother two big items instead.\n\n295\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.570\nNotice the one that says Blank Form.\n\n296\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.380\nAnd Vonne, when I think of blank form,\n\n297\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.840\nI go everything that's\nactually going to happen.\n\n298\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.170\nI control everything.\n\n299\n00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.280\nCreate a form with no controls or format.\n\n300\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.990\nStart from scratch, okay?\n\n301\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:24.375\nSo you would think that this would be\nthe one that gives you the most hands on\n\n302\n00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:26.721\ncontrol that you could ever do, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:28.160\nSo let's select it.\n\n304\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.400\nAnd here we are.\n\n305\n00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:37.760\nWe are now in our form with our\nform field that we see here.\n\n306\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.704\nAnd you can see that there's a field list\nover here on the left hand side, and\n\n307\n00:16:42.704 --> 00:16:44.876\nI have this blank canvas, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:44.876 --> 00:16:49.664\nWell, this means over on the field list,\nI can still select the tables\n\n309\n00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:54.627\nby clicking Show Tables, then I can\nselect the customer's table here.\n\n310\n00:16:54.627 --> 00:16:58.846\nAnd add in fields one at\na time by simply dragging and\n\n311\n00:16:58.846 --> 00:17:02.690\ndropping them on to this\nwhite area over here.\n\n312\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.240\nNow Vonne, you would think that okay,\nthat sounds cool, right?\n\n313\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.280\nI can put things where I want to.\n\n314\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.380\nBut watch what happens.\n\n315\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.890\nIf I select CustomerId,\nI'm gonna drag it down here.\n\n316\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.276\nWhere did it put it, Vonne?\n\n317\n00:17:14.276 --> 00:17:14.978\n&gt;&gt; Can we zoom out a little bit?\n\n318\n00:17:14.978 --> 00:17:21.318\nOkay, so you were trying to put it,\nsay, in the middle of, let's try again.\n\n319\n00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:21.921\nLet's do another one.\n\n320\n00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:23.684\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so\nI'm gonna select the loyalty ID,\n\n321\n00:17:23.684 --> 00:17:25.370\nI'm gonna try and\ndrag it down here, all right.\n\n322\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's still using the in\ncolumns format [LAUGH] right there,\n\n323\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.920\nso it's not really just\na complete free for\n\n324\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.650\nall of I want this element here,\nhere, here, here.\n\n325\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's just gonna\n\n326\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.910\nautomatically drop it into\nthat particular layout.\n\n327\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna drop it\nwherever it wants to drop it.\n\n328\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.194\nAnd notice that it's really just saying,\nhey,\n\n329\n00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:52.407\nI'm gonna drop it pretty much right there.\n\n330\n00:17:52.407 --> 00:17:55.177\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the next available slot,\n\n331\n00:17:55.177 --> 00:17:56.541\nif you wanna say.\n\n332\n00:17:56.541 --> 00:18:01.303\n&gt;&gt; So it seems to be,\nnow there, you started to see-\n\n333\n00:18:01.303 --> 00:18:02.027\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n334\n00:18:02.027 --> 00:18:04.465\n[LAUGH] Look at that.\n\n335\n00:18:04.465 --> 00:18:07.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, look at that.\n\n336\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.465\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] what has happened?\n\n337\n00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:10.228\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here,\n\n338\n00:18:10.228 --> 00:18:13.124\nnow if I start to place\nthem a little bit more,\n\n339\n00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:17.103\nnotice that it actually created\nthis kind of weird grid here.\n\n340\n00:18:17.103 --> 00:18:20.904\nLet me see, does it allow me to move it?\n\n341\n00:18:20.904 --> 00:18:25.150\nSee, so now that it created that\nfirst grid, it creates this grouping.\n\n342\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.190\nAnd that's what this is called.\n\n343\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.093\nSee that little kind of, whatever\nthey're called, what's that called?\n\n344\n00:18:30.093 --> 00:18:30.593\n&gt;&gt; Four point arrows?\n\n345\n00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:31.556\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I call them.\n\n346\n00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:32.686\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like I say,\n\n347\n00:18:32.686 --> 00:18:33.959\nI know they're technically\ncalled something.\n\n348\n00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:34.900\nI don't know what it's called.\n\n349\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n350\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.060\nthis is technically called a grouping\nof fields, is what it's called.\n\n351\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.570\nAnd allows us to go ahead and\nstructure the data in that play.\n\n352\n00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.435\nSo see where I can actually put certain\nthings, I can move them around.\n\n353\n00:18:46.435 --> 00:18:51.520\nBut Vonne, if I try and move this\ndown here, notice it doesn't do that.\n\n354\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.010\nSo it keeps me within that grouping,\nis what it does.\n\n355\n00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.796\nCan I move it down here?\n\n356\n00:18:54.796 --> 00:18:57.536\nYes, let me see if I can try that again.\n\n357\n00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.103\nI can move that down here, but\n\n358\n00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:02.180\nit doesn't really allow me to\nmove it out of the grouping.\n\n359\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.419\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing I've noticed is\nthat now this label and the input field or\n\n360\n00:19:06.419 --> 00:19:10.607\nthe actual form field itself is kind of,\nthey're two separate entities.\n\n361\n00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:12.665\nThey don't really go together, so\n\n362\n00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:16.642\nwhere you just kinda took that\nloyalty ID- and moved it down, well,\n\n363\n00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:20.162\nthe field it's associated with\nwas way over off to the side.\n\n364\n00:19:20.162 --> 00:19:27.095\nSo you gotta be a little careful\nabout where you're going in this.\n\n365\n00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:27.755\n&gt;&gt; You really do.\n\n366\n00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:32.552\nSo that blank thing sounds\nwonderful until you do that, right?\n\n367\n00:19:32.552 --> 00:19:35.780\nNow and this actually does lead us, let me\ngo ahead and finish the rest of this so\n\n368\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.790\nthat you can see it.\n\n369\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.224\nI'm just gonna double click and have it\nplaced where it should be, there we go.\n\n370\n00:19:40.224 --> 00:19:43.301\nOkay, and that should actually put\neverything the way they want to.\n\n371\n00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:46.951\nFrom this point, you can now add\nin modifications and formatting,\n\n372\n00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:48.688\nwhatever else needs to be done.\n\n373\n00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:52.483\nBut there is one more thing I wanna show\nyou about this field list though, okay?\n\n374\n00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:54.928\nOne of the things that really irked me,\nVonne,\n\n375\n00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:58.845\nat the very beginning when I started\nlearning about access is that field list\n\n376\n00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:01.100\nused to not be just set here, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.500\nWhen you first started, it would appear\non the screen like a floating window.\n\n378\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.040\nAnd if you were like me, you're going\nokay, I wanna look at that next.\n\n379\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.000\nLet me just take a look\nat the whole thing.\n\n380\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.669\nYou went and you clicked in here,\nand the field list disappeared.\n\n381\n00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:14.574\nSo I know you remember that, Vonne.\n\n382\n00:20:14.574 --> 00:20:18.418\nI mean, the field list would disappear,\nand you're looking like okay,\n\n383\n00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:19.663\nthe field list is gone.\n\n384\n00:20:19.663 --> 00:20:21.543\nHow do I get that back?\n\n385\n00:20:21.543 --> 00:20:23.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what am I supposed to do now?\n\n386\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.740\n&gt;&gt; What am I supposed to do now?\n\n387\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.290\nAnd that was really frustrating, because\neverything was underneath those menus.\n\n388\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:32.500\nWell, up here in the Tools section,\nor the Tools grouping, okay,\n\n389\n00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.970\nall I have to do is select Add Existing\nFields, okay, and that's what will be.\n\n390\n00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.180\nAnd that will go ahead and\nput the field list back over here\n\n391\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.200\non the right hand side for\nyou to be able to do this.\n\n392\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.040\nSo it does give us some\nmeasure of freedom.\n\n393\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.147\nBut notice how it's very controlled in\nwhat it sets in that grouping as what we\n\n394\n00:20:53.147 --> 00:20:53.725\nsee here.\n\n395\n00:20:53.725 --> 00:20:57.704\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know if this is\nthe proper place to say this, but\n\n396\n00:20:57.704 --> 00:21:01.340\nI feel like this could be\na little dangerous too.\n\n397\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.850\nIf you're just willy nilly grabbing\na field from one table and\n\n398\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.200\nthen putting another one from\nanother table and it's all together.\n\n399\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.625\nWell, if we're trying to maintain data\nintegrity, for lack of a better term,\n\n400\n00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:19.790\nyou're just gonna fill in this one place,\nbut not the rest of the record.\n\n401\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.595\nSo this is where we can kinda\nget ourselves in trouble, maybe?\n\n402\n00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:27.809\n&gt;&gt; I think it's possible if we hadn't\nturned on referential integrity, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:31.714\nSo because we actually did enable\nreferential integrity between\n\n404\n00:21:31.714 --> 00:21:34.840\nthose tables,\nwe shouldn't be able to do that.\n\n405\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.700\nIn other words, if we try and\nupdate that one table, and it may\n\n406\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.345\nactually have to update another record\nin the other table, it should update.\n\n407\n00:21:41.345 --> 00:21:45.388\nThe same thing, if I delete something out\nof this one table, and it may influence\n\n408\n00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:49.430\nthe other one on the other table,\nit should also delete that out as well.\n\n409\n00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.220\nSo that referential integrity\nis very important at this point.\n\n410\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess right here, on the one\nthat we see right here on the screen,\n\n411\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.134\nwhat if I did not put city,\nphone, email, state?\n\n412\n00:21:58.134 --> 00:22:01.560\nI just left those off and just put\nfirst name, last name, and address.\n\n413\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.940\nWell, if somebody filled this out,\n\n414\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.860\nthen the record in the table\nwould be incomplete.\n\n415\n00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n416\n00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.555\n&gt;&gt; So that's where-\n&gt;&gt; We lose gaps.\n\n417\n00:22:11.555 --> 00:22:14.377\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and you don't-\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna do that.\n\n418\n00:22:14.377 --> 00:22:18.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess that's where I was kinda\ngoing with that question in the sense.\n\n419\n00:22:18.278 --> 00:22:22.674\nAnd so if [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you forget that stop,\n\n420\n00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:26.990\nthen it won't be there for\nsomebody to enter the data entry in.\n\n421\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.870\nSo building a form, this is why I\nrecommend, Vonne, that if we do this for\n\n422\n00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.340\nsomebody else, it's easier if we\nactually say, here's what I'm gonna do,\n\n423\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.370\nI'm gonna create a select query, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.890\nAnd then this is when I know that Bob\nis going to have to enter the data in,\n\n425\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.280\nand we'll tell him.\n\n426\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.205\nMake sure you do not leave the field blank\nand later on decide with the advance\n\n427\n00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:51.658\naccess show actually see where we say,\nyou can't leave it blank.\n\n428\n00:22:51.658 --> 00:22:55.020\nIt has to have something in there\nto make sure it goes on, and\n\n429\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.910\nwe can even control the way how the actual\nletters even appear, if we want to.\n\n430\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.630\nSo it's amazing that the controls\nthat you really do have,\n\n431\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.400\nbut this is a big part of it, right?\n\n432\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.361\nThe very fact that we can at least get\nthe data in there, another fast and\n\n433\n00:23:09.361 --> 00:23:13.141\nfurious method, it gives you a little\nbit more control in this way.\n\n434\n00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:15.648\nUnlike the way that we did\nwhen we hit the form button,\n\n435\n00:23:15.648 --> 00:23:17.930\nwhere it just pulled in that table.\n\n436\n00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.950\nBut this one does give you\nthe ability to do both.\n\n437\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.248\nActually, I'm lying to you,\nthis one only gives you the ability to do,\n\n438\n00:23:24.248 --> 00:23:26.356\nI was looking over here\non the right hand side,\n\n439\n00:23:26.356 --> 00:23:29.250\ngives you the ability to actually\nonly look in the tables here.\n\n440\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.282\nI wanna share with you,\n\n441\n00:23:30.282 --> 00:23:33.081\nthis one actually gave me the ability\nto look at queries as well.\n\n442\n00:23:33.081 --> 00:23:37.056\nBut both the regular form button,\nas well as the actual blank form,\n\n443\n00:23:37.056 --> 00:23:40.488\nwhich is what this one is,\nit will not allow you to do that.\n\n444\n00:23:40.488 --> 00:23:45.042\nYou're simply gonna have to select from\ntables, so that's why we also then,\n\n445\n00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:47.531\nif we know that that is what's happening.\n\n446\n00:23:47.531 --> 00:23:49.452\nAnd this is what's happening,\nVonne, is that,\n\n447\n00:23:49.452 --> 00:23:52.401\nlet's say that we've gone through now and\nwe've taken a look at the forms.\n\n448\n00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:56.047\nAnd got, it'll work, but\nit's not what I really want.\n\n449\n00:23:56.047 --> 00:23:58.823\nWe go through the wizard and\nsay, it's basic.\n\n450\n00:23:58.823 --> 00:24:02.785\nIt shows me, and I think I could\ntake that and massage it around and\n\n451\n00:24:02.785 --> 00:24:03.876\ndo what I want to.\n\n452\n00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:06.535\nI'd have to get rid of a lot of stuff\nto make it work, we can do that.\n\n453\n00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:09.846\nAnd this one,\nit doesn't really do what I wanna do, but\n\n454\n00:24:09.846 --> 00:24:12.457\nI could work with it,\nif I needed to, okay?\n\n455\n00:24:12.457 --> 00:24:16.184\nWell, if all that is not what\nyou're really looking for,\n\n456\n00:24:16.184 --> 00:24:20.920\nthat means you have to manually create\nyour own custom form at that point.\n\n457\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.683\nAnd that's what we still\nneed to actually do.\n\n458\n00:24:23.683 --> 00:24:27.659\nSo Vonne, as we actually take a look at\nthis, it means that we really have to do\n\n459\n00:24:27.659 --> 00:24:31.416\nthat, but I don't think I can do that\nin three minutes that we have left.\n\n460\n00:24:31.416 --> 00:24:32.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne,\n\n461\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.707\nit looks like we're gonna have to\nactually do a part three here.\n\n462\n00:24:34.707 --> 00:24:36.966\n&gt;&gt; There's that fine acting\ncoming through again.\n\n463\n00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:40.391\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He'll leave us guessing of what's gonna\n\n464\n00:24:40.391 --> 00:24:41.239\ncome up next.\n\n465\n00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:43.328\nWell, you kinda already told us that,\n[LAUGH].\n\n466\n00:24:43.328 --> 00:24:44.630\nWe're gonna build a custom form.\n\n467\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.732\n[LAUGH] And I'm assuming that we're gonna\ndo some of those things that we saw up in\n\n468\n00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:51.809\nthe ribbon up there with the drop\ndowns and the check boxes.\n\n469\n00:24:51.809 --> 00:24:54.979\nAnd this is something that I\ndo know a decent amount about.\n\n470\n00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:55.839\n&gt;&gt; Good, excellent.\n\n471\n00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:58.207\n&gt;&gt; So\nmaybe I can help bring in some insight.\n\n472\n00:24:58.207 --> 00:24:59.958\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Besides just asking you question after\n\n473\n00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:00.843\nquestion after question.\n\n474\n00:25:00.843 --> 00:25:04.547\n[LAUGH] Well, let's go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n475\n00:25:04.547 --> 00:25:07.403\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for OfficeProTV.\n\n476\n00:25:07.403 --> 00:25:08.796\nI've been your host, Vonne

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And back to show us his amazing acting.\n\n7\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.620\nWell, we're not really acting here.\n\n8\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.856\nWe're just keeping it real.\n\n9\n00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:35.530\nMr. Ronnie Wong [LAUGH], how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\nI am doing fine, Vonne.\n\n11\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.600\nThank you again.\n\n12\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.080\nAnd yes, I am not acting.\n\n13\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.860\nBelieve it or not, this is who I am.\n\n14\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.080\nWe are continuing on here.\n\n15\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.070\nTaking a look at forms as Vonne\nis actually on a hangover\n\n16\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.680\nfrom layover somewhere.\n\n17\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.000\n&gt;&gt; Not that you need to know, but I was\non a plane really early this morning.\n\n18\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.781\nIt's the afternoon right now,\nand I am running on fumes.\n\n19\n00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:01.397\nSo yeah, maybe I'm the one who's acting\n\n20\n00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:02.299\na little bit-\n\n21\n00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n\n22\n00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm awake.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.195\n&gt;&gt; She's at least telling herself that.\n\n24\n00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:08.116\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; As we continue\n\n25\n00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.649\non through taking a look at,\nof course, creating a basic form.\n\n26\n00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.509\nNow Von, we've already done taking\na look at the majority of the tools.\n\n27\n00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.390\nThere are still a few.\n\n28\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.390\nI'm not gonna be able to say it.\n\n29\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.866\nThere's still a few tools.\n\n30\n00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, I can't say it.\n\n31\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.540\n&gt;&gt; We can do it.\n&gt;&gt; Tools out there\n\n32\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.760\nthat we need to take a look at as well,\n\n33\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.010\nand then we wanna create a basic\n&gt;&gt; Form,\n\n34\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.130\nusing the Form Design View which is gonna\ngive us the most control that we need,\n\n35\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.540\nand actually fit our needs better,\nmore than anything else, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.720\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this as well, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.160\nSo, last couple of things,\nI'm just gonna point this things out for\n\n38\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.720\nus a little bit more.\n\n39\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.130\nAs we've been working in the forms\ngrouping a little bit, right?\n\n40\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.000\nWe've gone through and we've created\na form using the form button and\n\n41\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480\nof course the blank form,\nwhich we showed you.\n\n42\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.020\nThe form wizard we went\nall the way through.\n\n43\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.850\nWe showed you the blank form.\n\n44\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.520\nAnd now there's two more.\n\n45\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.550\nNow, these are really for more advanced\ntypes of things that may end up happening.\n\n46\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.010\nBut notice when it says create\na form that allows people to browse\n\n47\n00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.380\nto different forms or reports.\n\n48\n00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.400\nThat's a little bit more unusual.\n\n49\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.510\nAnd what this is saying is that we can\nactually create this to give us navigation\n\n50\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.570\ndifferently here.\n\n51\n00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.050\n&gt;&gt; Is this almost like it was like\na DVD menu or something, I'm thinking-\n\n52\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.810\n&gt;&gt; Just about yes.\n\n53\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or like this is like our\nmain menu because we might have,\n\n54\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.360\nlet's see we might have 15 forms or\nsomething and three of them are for\n\n55\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.070\nemployee records and so it is a table\nof contents, or it's a form for a form.\n\n56\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.880\n&gt;&gt; It's unusual but\nthis is what, in the olden days.\n\n57\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.830\nI'm gonna use the term that\nwe all use around here.\n\n58\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.066\nWhich we don't know what it means,\nbut we do it, back in the day.\n\n59\n00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we all do it.\n\n60\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.195\nBack in the day, we used to call\nthis something like the switchboard.\n\n61\n00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:54.066\nNow, Vonne,\n\n62\n00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:59.600\nyou remember when we talked about the idea\nof a switch board as a switchboard back.\n\n63\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.270\nAnd for those that don't remember that\nspine, when you have multiple forms and\n\n64\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.130\nyou want to lock down those forms, or you\nwant to actually kind of categorize them,\n\n65\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.740\nwhat you do is you create a switchboard.\n\n66\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.360\nAnd this is the same thing\nin terms of navigation.\n\n67\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.800\nIt allows us to say you wanna go here to\ndo data entry, then you actually have\n\n68\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.430\nthree or four forms behind there\nthat you can do the data entry in.\n\n69\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.330\nYou want to go and do a query, you instead\ncan go to these areas and do a query.\n\n70\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.910\nAnd so\nthis allows you to kind of grove them and\n\n71\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.630\nallows you to navigate through them\nthe way that you want to as well.\n\n72\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.030\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhen you're saying locking them down,\n\n73\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.950\nin a sense they wouldn't like see them.\n\n74\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Over on the left hand main navigation,\n\n75\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.840\nwhere we see tables and queries,\nbut they see one navigation form.\n\n76\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You click it, and\n\n77\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.640\nthen it gives you all\nthe options of where you can go.\n\n78\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n79\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.700\nAgain, you might see buttons, or\nyou might see tabs across the top\n\n80\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.930\nthat allow you to pick this one, but\nyou don't choose to go that one.\n\n81\n00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.880\nWhatever it might be, you have that.\n\n82\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.850\nThere's also some other forms here, too.\n\n83\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.950\nMultiple Items creates a form that\nshows multiple records at one time.\n\n84\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.910\nWe really looked at this data\nsheet form inside the Form Wizard.\n\n85\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.440\nThe Split Form's a little bit more\nunusual, it says creates a split form\n\n86\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.440\nthat shoes data sheet in the upper section\nand a form in the lower one instead.\n\n87\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.390\nSo this is actually something\nthat's very good for\n\n88\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.700\nsomebody that may be trying to verify and\ndo that data entry at the same time.\n\n89\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.810\nThey enter it in the form and\n\n90\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.500\nthey watch the actual data appear in\nthat data sheet view at the top, then,\n\n91\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.480\nthey know that it actually got entered in\nand they're doing stuff like that as well.\n\n92\n00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.910\n&gt;&gt; It almost has two different views,\nthe entry view and\n\n93\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.496\nthe result of what it's\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like what we use for markdown-\n\n94\n00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:37.720\n&gt;&gt; For the preview.\n\n95\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.690\nThat makes sense.\n\n97\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.680\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen you have an interactive one too.\n\n98\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.400\nSetting up the modal dialog takes a little\nbit longer for you to be able to do.\n\n99\n00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.530\nIt is possible.\n\n100\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.370\nThis is just more interactive.\n\n101\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.670\nIt has different pop ups or different,\nand make sure you answer questions so\n\n102\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.990\nthat you end up getting what you want to.\n\n103\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.940\nAnd we used to call this\na parameterized view as well.\n\n104\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm still stuck back on\nthe navigation one of like I'm envisioning\n\n105\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.530\nbuttons and some colors and so you could\nget that far into it if you wanted to.\n\n106\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in the end, when we used to\ndo that idea, you'd lock down the entire\n\n107\n00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.410\ndatabase and the only thing that would\npop up when people would double-click\n\n108\n00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.820\non this file is that particular navigation\nor that particular switch board so\n\n109\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.810\nthat couldn't get access to anything but\nthe switchboard.\n\n110\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.020\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\nyou just kind of clicked in my brain like!\n\n111\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.620\nI'm getting it now.\n\n112\n00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.510\nYeah, they see nothing else.\n\n113\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.039\n&gt;&gt; Yes, except for\nwhat we want them to see.\n\n114\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.530\nOkay, see you have these\nkey sentences that come out\n\n115\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.540\nhere where it just kind of all\nmakes sense to me, so that was one.\n\n116\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.795\nDing ding!\nYou did a good job.\n\n117\n00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:51.183\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sometimes,\n\n118\n00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:54.540\nI have that effect on people I don't\nknow what happens but it does work.\n\n119\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.225\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you have your own shirts Ronnie,\ncome one.\n\n120\n00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:57.323\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I truly won, I know,\n\n121\n00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.050\nonce again thank you Vonne for\npointing that out.\n\n122\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.030\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\nmove out from there, now, as I said,\n\n123\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.462\nwe would see that more at the advanced\nshow, more than this projector show, but,\n\n124\n00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:10.223\nright now,\nwe want to get into creating a form, and\n\n125\n00:06:10.223 --> 00:06:13.469\nI'll create a very simple form for\nus is what I'm gonna do.\n\n126\n00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.477\nA great thing is that what you'll learn\nhere and when we go into reports,\n\n127\n00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:20.050\nyou'll see it's really not that different.\n\n128\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.402\nBut in creating the form that we want,\nit really does help us out in a couple of\n\n129\n00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:27.938\nways as we do this because it\nallows us to pick the feels I want,\n\n130\n00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:31.300\nwe can place them exactly\nwhere we want to as well.\n\n131\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.340\nSo I want to make sure I was actually in\nthe right place as I started to zoom in.\n\n132\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.268\nI'm just gonna click on the form\ndesign and when we do so,\n\n133\n00:06:38.268 --> 00:06:40.159\nyou'll notice that it changes, and\n\n134\n00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.960\nwe now have this unusual looking area\nthat we are going to get to work with.\n\n135\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.525\nWe, of course,\nhave all these access objects.\n\n136\n00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:50.700\nNow, Vonne, I did want to actually\nmention something, which I forgot to,\n\n137\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.400\nnot forgot, but I wanted to mention\nbefore I forget, is what I wanted to say.\n\n138\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.390\nIs that if you're going Ronnie, what\nabout all those other forms that we did?\n\n139\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.650\nNotice down here in the lower right\nhand corner, I went ahead and\n\n140\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.720\nI created those forms and saved them for\nus as well so we could see them.\n\n141\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.130\n&gt;&gt; And this is the beauty of post editing\nif you want to say or what have you,\n\n142\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.710\nthe behind the scenes of you created\nthis for us, for the viewers\n\n143\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.510\nto be able to see everything created and\ndone so we have like a check in point.\n\n144\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.800\nAnd so this will be in the episode\nfiles and everything, so\n\n145\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.750\nyou know where they're at.\n\n146\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I just wanted to make sure\nthat we mentioned that and you'll see\n\n147\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.270\nthe names of the file that we're working\nwith here as we go on through the show.\n\n148\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.990\nBut you'll also see it\nas you go to the show,\n\n149\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.070\nthe actual show as you're watching them in\nthe link there as well in the notes, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.569\nSo here is the area that we're essentially\nworking and when we start creating forms,\n\n151\n00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:47.392\nyou do have to pay attention to a couple\nof things in terms of size, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:49.983\nThis particular form right now,\n\n153\n00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:54.800\nnotice it goes from 0 to about 6 and\n8 or so is what it goes to.\n\n154\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.220\nIf you want to extend that,\nyou can always hover over the edge.\n\n155\n00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.491\nAnd then you can drag that out.\n\n156\n00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:02.232\nNow, you do have to worry\nabout your paper margins,\n\n157\n00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.400\nespecially if you're printing\nthis out in some way.\n\n158\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.890\nMost of us probably aren't, so\n\n159\n00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.870\nwe don't really have to worry about\nit too much as far as a form.\n\n160\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.460\nIn a report, you have to worry about more.\n\n161\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.750\n&gt;&gt; But you might wanna consider\nresolution like modern resolution, so\n\n162\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.850\npeople don't have to scroll\nhorizontally in the forms.\n\n163\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.270\nAnd it is something to at\nleast take note of, and\n\n164\n00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.530\nbe considerate, or\nmake it a consideration.\n\n165\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.999\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, that actually is a good\nidea, especially if other people\n\n166\n00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:33.942\nare gonna be using this, and we also see\nit went down to about 5 and a quarter.\n\n167\n00:08:33.942 --> 00:08:35.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume is what I did.\n\n168\n00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:38.970\nSo if I wanted to,\nI could actually drag or pull it up.\n\n169\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.240\nIt just doesn't matter.\n\n170\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.930\nIt really depends on what it is that\nyou would choose to actually see.\n\n171\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.380\nJust pull it up there to about 4 and\na half here, if I wanted to.\n\n172\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.800\nAnd say that that's the size.\n\n173\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.930\nI'm gonna put down to 5.\n\n174\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.542\nIt started to look a little bit really\nsmall on my screen here as we start to\n\n175\n00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:55.086\nsee this.\n\n176\n00:08:55.086 --> 00:08:58.741\nNow once we have this done,\nokay, now we get to pick and\n\n177\n00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.452\nchoose the fields that we want to be\ninside of this particular report.\n\n178\n00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:06.620\nI'm gonna close out of\nthis property sheet, and\n\n179\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.500\nthat's something you have to\npay attention to as well, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.680\nThe property sheet is\nhow we manipulate and\n\n181\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.310\nmodify every individual element on\nour form, as well as the form itself.\n\n182\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.620\nAnd if you take a look at this button\nright here in that upper left-hand corner,\n\n183\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.505\nokay, that particular button\nis actually kind of neat.\n\n184\n00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:29.828\nIf you double-click on it, that is\nwhat they call the Property Sheet for\n\n185\n00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:32.195\nthe entire form itself, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:36.195\nSo you wanna make sure that you pay\nattention to what shows up right\n\n187\n00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:39.251\nhere in this box before\nyou start manipulating and\n\n188\n00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:42.900\nchanging anything in terms\nof the properties here.\n\n189\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.920\n&gt;&gt; And I think you're doing a little\nforeshadowing here, cuz this\n\n190\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.950\nis the property of the form as opposed\nto when we get fields on there.\n\n191\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.021\nThen you're talking about\nthe field property.\n\n192\n00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n193\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.330\n&gt;&gt; So that's where we're saying just\npay attention to what thing your on,\n\n194\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.010\nthat individual piece, or the whole thing.\n\n195\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's very easy to think that\nyou manipulate and change something.\n\n196\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.600\nBut even though you change\nit on a property sheet,\n\n197\n00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.730\nyou might not have changed it for\nthe correct item.\n\n198\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.030\nSo that's why we wanted to\nemphasize that as well, okay?\n\n199\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.656\nAll right, so Vonne,\nI'm gonna create just a simple form, and\n\n200\n00:10:18.656 --> 00:10:21.679\ntake a look at the idea of\njust entering in some data and\n\n201\n00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:24.852\nthen adding in some information\nas we want it to as well.\n\n202\n00:10:24.852 --> 00:10:26.534\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\ndo you mind if I ask a quick question?\n\n203\n00:10:26.534 --> 00:10:27.340\n&gt;&gt; No, that's fine.\n\n204\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.294\n&gt;&gt; Well since we're on the form,\n\n205\n00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:32.988\ndo we need to take notice of\nanything on the form property?\n\n206\n00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:35.780\nDoes it have to connect\nto a specific table?\n\n207\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.597\nOr is there anything before we go into\nthe field that we should kinda focus on\n\n208\n00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:41.369\nthis part?\n\n209\n00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:43.062\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, Vonne.\n\n210\n00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:46.338\nI am trying to see if there's anything\nelse that I may be throwing out at this\n\n211\n00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:49.465\npoint, so Vonne, you point out\nsomething about miss something here.\n\n212\n00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:50.197\nYeah.\n\n213\n00:10:50.197 --> 00:10:51.232\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n214\n00:10:51.232 --> 00:10:52.481\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now.\nOkay, it went through.\n\n215\n00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:53.133\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea.\n\n216\n00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:53.885\nIt was really just a question.\n\n217\n00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:55.249\n&gt;&gt; I thought she was trying to lead me on,\n\n218\n00:10:55.249 --> 00:10:57.653\nsince I'm like I am forgetting\nsomething so let me look down here.\n\n219\n00:10:57.653 --> 00:10:58.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n220\n00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:03.430\nno, we actually will add in the fields\nthat we need to as we go along here.\n\n221\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.960\nSo it should actually work\njust fine at this point.\n\n222\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.904\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm probably to just, wait,\nand let you get the form fields in.\n\n223\n00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:11.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.\n\n224\n00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:13.396\n&gt;&gt; That's probably gonna\nanswer my question but\n\n225\n00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:15.223\nas soon as you pick the fields,\nit's gonna wait.\n\n226\n00:11:15.223 --> 00:11:15.760\nIt's gonna connect.\n\n227\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.735\nIt's enabled that they're coming.\n\n228\n00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:17.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna connect.\n\n229\n00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:18.535\nYep, that's right, okay.\n\n230\n00:11:18.535 --> 00:11:20.455\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I told you,\nI've been up for way too long today.\n\n231\n00:11:20.455 --> 00:11:22.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's perfectly fine.\n\n232\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.675\nSo the way that we're gonna\ndo that of course is up here.\n\n233\n00:11:24.675 --> 00:11:29.243\nOnce we actually have the form and design\nview, knows that will of course give you\n\n234\n00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:32.818\nthe form design tools in that\ncontextual tab, select Design.\n\n235\n00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.995\nAnd then over in the tools grouping,\n\n236\n00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:38.236\nadd in the fields that we want\nto be able to manipulate.\n\n237\n00:11:38.236 --> 00:11:43.010\nWe're going to select Add Existing Fields,\nokay?\n\n238\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:48.020\nWhen we add the existing fields in,\nthis is where on the right-hand side\n\n239\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.020\nthat you can choose the fields from\nthese tables if you want to, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.344\nSo, at this particular point,\nI'm just going to select,\n\n241\n00:11:57.344 --> 00:12:00.722\nlet's do the employees\nagain just this time.\n\n242\n00:12:00.722 --> 00:12:02.413\nI don't think I've done employees.\n\n243\n00:12:02.413 --> 00:12:04.620\nI think I've done\neverything else right now.\n\n244\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.640\nBut let's just select to update.\n\n245\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.198\nLet's say,\nthe employee ID field here, okay?\n\n246\n00:12:09.198 --> 00:12:15.158\nSo if I select employee ID, okay, I can,\nit doesn't allow me to double-click here.\n\n247\n00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:20.075\nI can just click, and I can drag, and now,\nI want you to just kind of focus in on\n\n248\n00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:23.620\nsomething before we add\nin a few more fields.\n\n249\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.900\nNotice it adds in a label, okay, and\n\n250\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.990\nthat's what this is\ncalled in the background.\n\n251\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.520\nAnd this is now considered a control.\n\n252\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.086\nNow it's still a field and a table, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:36.232\nSo over here it's called our field list,\nbut it also can be a control.\n\n254\n00:12:36.232 --> 00:12:43.060\nNow a control is technically up here which\nis an object inside of the form, okay?\n\n255\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.510\nSo, even though this is\ntechnically a field,\n\n256\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.190\nit's also technically\na control at the same time.\n\n257\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, and when we're talking to me, cuz\nI've actually referred to them quite a few\n\n258\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.827\ntimes this episode as fields because in\nbuilding HTML forms, that's a form field.\n\n259\n00:12:56.827 --> 00:12:58.937\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And there's different types of form\n\n260\n00:12:58.937 --> 00:13:03.864\nfields, whether it's an input, or a radio,\nor a checkbox, but they're all fields.\n\n261\n00:13:03.864 --> 00:13:04.407\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n262\n00:13:04.407 --> 00:13:06.972\n&gt;&gt; But\nnow since we're in the terminology of\n\n263\n00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:07.833\na database-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n264\n00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:12.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, these are now\nconsidered controls within a form.\n\n265\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep.\n\n266\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n267\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.210\n&gt;&gt; So it's just a little bit of\ndifferent naming that you have there.\n\n268\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.050\nBut I went ahead and I separated them out.\n\n269\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.870\nAnd this is gonna be\na little bit difficult.\n\n270\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.870\nLet me do that again to try and\nshow you what cuz I started to do this and\n\n271\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.440\nI started to talk at the same time.\n\n272\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.005\nSo Vonne says it's Ctrl+Delete-\n&gt;&gt; Or function.\n\n273\n00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Function-delete.\n&gt;&gt; Function-delete.\n\n274\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.910\n&gt;&gt; See, function-delete, there we go.\n\n275\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.100\nSo if I click and\nI drag this in here again.\n\n276\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.280\nNotice how they're kind of\nbunched together, okay?\n\n277\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.830\nHow they're pretty much\nright on top of each other.\n\n278\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:47.640\nIf I just click on the actual box itself,\nwhich is what holds my data in here.\n\n279\n00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.690\nNotice if I hover over the edge,\nit gives me that four point arrow?\n\n280\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.400\nIf I click and drag this, okay?\n\n281\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.883\nIt actually moves together, okay?\n\n282\n00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:57.500\nBut it doesn't separate it out.\n\n283\n00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.830\nIf I want to separate these out so\nthat they're not overlapping,\n\n284\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:05.350\nI need to hover over this\ngray square right here, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.030\nThen I can click and drag that out.\n\n286\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.070\nAnd now, notice that I've separated\nthose two fields out, okay?\n\n287\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.950\nSo, I now have my label and\nI now have my particular field or\n\n288\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.980\nmy control that I have this.\n\n289\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.806\nNow every control and\njust about every field will end up with\n\n290\n00:14:22.806 --> 00:14:27.150\nthis label idea [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And I can remember this vividly.\n\n291\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.878\nI'm like why won't it just separate?\n\n292\n00:14:28.878 --> 00:14:32.311\nAnd I don't know if it was\nthis particular program or\n\n293\n00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:36.690\nit's if you kinda clicked off of it,\ndeselected them both first.\n\n294\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.930\nThen you could be able to hover,\nlike you said,\n\n295\n00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.592\nover the gray label versus the control and\nthen move them separately.\n\n296\n00:14:45.592 --> 00:14:49.550\nAnd then once they're kinda far\nenough apart, now the yellowing,\n\n297\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.468\nis that what we call it,\nthe yellow box around it,\n\n298\n00:14:52.468 --> 00:14:56.090\nnow you can really differentiate\nwhich piece your work with.\n\n299\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.183\nBut it can be really tricky.\n\n300\n00:14:58.183 --> 00:14:58.892\nAnd one little side note.\n\n301\n00:14:58.892 --> 00:15:02.561\nThat whole function-delete thing that\nI was just calling, that's just for\n\n302\n00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:06.681\nus using Macs in a virtual machine Windows\nenvironment because the delete key doesn't\n\n303\n00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:10.024\nact like a true delete key in Windows,\nso if you do function-delete.\n\n304\n00:15:10.024 --> 00:15:11.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you're like,\n\n305\n00:15:11.558 --> 00:15:12.839\nwhat are they talking about?\n\n306\n00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:17.860\nNo, that's not some shortcut if\nyou're in Access 2016 for Windows.\n\n307\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.872\nIt's just for us.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:15:18.872 --> 00:15:19.959\n&gt;&gt; So disregard that little comment.\n\n309\n00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:22.474\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, now the other thing that you\n\n310\n00:15:22.474 --> 00:15:25.114\nmay also do is you choose to\nmove these things around, right?\n\n311\n00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:27.451\nSo if I select EmployeeID,\n\n312\n00:15:27.451 --> 00:15:33.356\nI only have to kind of lasso a portion\nof that field to get both of them.\n\n313\n00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:36.020\nSo I'm gonna have to actually\ncircle the whole thing.\n\n314\n00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.445\nI just lassoed the portion of it.\n\n315\n00:15:37.445 --> 00:15:41.080\nI hovered over until I get\nthe four pointed arrow.\n\n316\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.050\nAnd now notice I can navigate, and\n\n317\n00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.220\nthen I can drop the field\nwhere I choose to drop it.\n\n318\n00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.850\n&gt;&gt; And this,\nI can almost feel it happening.\n\n319\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.399\nIs it doing the snap to grid?\n\n320\n00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.420\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n321\n00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.196\nthat's why we have this almost grid like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n322\n00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:58.876\n&gt;&gt; Paper for Us to help kind of align\nour labels and our controls and\n\n323\n00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:02.330\nmove them all around and\nthat's how it works.\n\n324\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.197\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is gonna be\nhelpful as we continue through this.\n\n325\n00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:08.800\nBecause you'll see that they're not\ngonna all align the way that we want to.\n\n326\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.690\nAnd that way we can measure\nout exactly like here.\n\n327\n00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.206\nNotice I know that there's\none row in between.\n\n328\n00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:17.880\nIs how I can also make sure that\nthat happens too, all right?\n\n329\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:25.191\nSo let me add in first name, And\nlet me also add in last name here, okay.\n\n330\n00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.610\nSo there it is.\n\n331\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.440\nIt actually happened again.\n\n332\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.329\nNow, this time Vonne, look,\nsomething else happened.\n\n333\n00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:32.685\n&gt;&gt; Notice where it says First, Last here.\n\n334\n00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:35.040\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou could like totally overlap these.\n\n335\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't have any kind of,\n\n336\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.263\nyou're on top of each other.\n\n337\n00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:40.271\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n338\n00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:44.435\n&gt;&gt; We're being very conscientious\nabout the different pieces, and okay.\n\n339\n00:16:44.435 --> 00:16:46.840\n&gt;&gt; And so this is where it's kinda weird.\n\n340\n00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.645\nYou might be wondering, like, well,\n\n341\n00:16:48.645 --> 00:16:50.732\nhow the heck do you know\nwhere to drop it then?\n\n342\n00:16:50.732 --> 00:16:51.676\nWell, let me show you.\n\n343\n00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:56.615\nIf I, inspect and zoom in here, if I\nselect the address, cause that's the next\n\n344\n00:16:56.615 --> 00:17:01.954\nfield that I want, notice where I actually\nhave that attachment to my cursor, okay?\n\n345\n00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:05.474\nWhere that,\nwhere the point of my cursor is, okay?\n\n346\n00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:09.680\nThat's pretty much gonna be where\nthat kinda gray box actually drops.\n\n347\n00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.518\nIf I know that, at least not for\nthe label but for this part, right?\n\n348\n00:17:13.518 --> 00:17:16.410\nIf I know that,\nthat's where that gray box is gonna drop.\n\n349\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.430\nLet me select that, like right here.\n\n350\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.582\nNotice how that actually worked.\n\n351\n00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.343\nYou can kind of space\nthis out a little bit.\n\n352\n00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:30.725\nThen you can go back and\nreadjust the sizing of these things.\n\n353\n00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:35.610\nSo that they do make a little bit more\nsense in what you want them to be if\n\n354\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.576\nyou can actually take the time to do this.\n\n355\n00:17:38.576 --> 00:17:44.508\nThis is where it becomes time is\nkind of the key element here, right?\n\n356\n00:17:44.508 --> 00:17:50.053\nIf the only job you have all day is making\naccess databases, this is perfect for you.\n\n357\n00:17:50.053 --> 00:17:52.689\nThis will allow you to\ndo this all day long and\n\n358\n00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:54.906\ndo everything else that you want to.\n\n359\n00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:59.305\nBut just kind of realize that most of the\ntime we're probably doing this in more of\n\n360\n00:17:59.305 --> 00:18:00.672\na hurry than we realize.\n\n361\n00:18:00.672 --> 00:18:04.890\n&gt;&gt; And I'm assuming maybe I'm\njumping ahead, that address control,\n\n362\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.835\nyou can make it bigger cause it's more\nthan likely that you're gonna need to have\n\n363\n00:18:09.835 --> 00:18:14.580\nmore room for the street address than you\nwould for like a first and last name.\n\n364\n00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.140\n&gt;&gt; That is true so Vaughn here again,\nwe have the sizing handles.\n\n365\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.876\nIf I hover over them, right?\n\n366\n00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:25.431\nYou can see where the arrows will change\nshape for us which means we can resize, so\n\n367\n00:18:25.431 --> 00:18:31.087\nthere it is, I get the double headed arrow\nand then, I actually moved it instead.\n\n368\n00:18:31.087 --> 00:18:33.727\n&gt;&gt; Is it because you have both the label,\nand the controls selected?\n\n369\n00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:34.479\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n370\n00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:35.375\nKnowing myself.\n\n371\n00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:36.639\n&gt;&gt; So is it click off of it, single click.\n\n372\n00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yep.\n\n373\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.540\nSee, this is where I could help a lot\nbecause I know with working with\n\n374\n00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.301\nPowerPoint, and\ndifferent things like that.\n\n375\n00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:45.819\nThere's always that click off it first,\nthen go back and\n\n376\n00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:49.342\nselect the individual piece that you want,\nand it makes it a little bit easier.\n\n377\n00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.096\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n378\n00:18:54.112 --> 00:18:56.000\nI was trying to make sure I had\nthat one column in between.\n\n379\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.967\nBut there we go.\n\n380\n00:18:56.967 --> 00:18:59.488\nSo now, I zoomed in way to much.\n\n381\n00:18:59.488 --> 00:19:00.944\nThat's what happened there, okay?\n\n382\n00:19:00.944 --> 00:19:04.444\nSo now, we've added in these\nparticular fields over here and\n\n383\n00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:06.948\nI want to just continue\nto add in what I want.\n\n384\n00:19:06.948 --> 00:19:10.467\nSo I'm just gonna pull out city and\nstate in here just so\n\n385\n00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:12.847\nthat we have something to work with.\n\n386\n00:19:12.847 --> 00:19:16.961\nJust at the beginning and then we'll\nchange a few things as we go on through.\n\n387\n00:19:16.961 --> 00:19:17.877\nSo Vaughn,\n\n388\n00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:24.310\nlet's use this as our simple data as\nwe're trying to do a few things, right?\n\n389\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:29.370\nSo if I now change my view up here\nin the upper left hand corner,\n\n390\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.780\nI select the Form View.\n\n391\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.765\nIt's an ugly form.\n\n392\n00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:34.711\nI'm gonna grant you that, okay.\n\n393\n00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:35.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n394\n00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.991\nthere is some elements in here that\nwe need to pay attention to, okay?\n\n395\n00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:44.149\nSo Yvonne watch what happens as I\nstart to navigate through this, okay?\n\n396\n00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:47.908\nNow this time, I'm not gonna use the\nactual navigation arrows at the bottom.\n\n397\n00:19:47.908 --> 00:19:49.787\nI'm gonna use my tab and Vaughn,\n\n398\n00:19:49.787 --> 00:19:52.860\nlook at the way that it's\nactually tabbing through.\n\n399\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.846\nIt's kinda wierd isn't it?\n\n400\n00:19:54.846 --> 00:19:59.947\n&gt;&gt; It's tabbing through based on\nthe organization of the table as\n\n401\n00:19:59.947 --> 00:20:04.496\nopposed to the organization of the Arm, I-\n&gt;&gt; It's coming through based on the order\n\n402\n00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.153\nthat I dropped these into the actual form,\nright?\n\n403\n00:20:06.153 --> 00:20:08.994\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what I was gonna say.\n\n404\n00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:09.537\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n405\n00:20:09.537 --> 00:20:13.113\nthere's stuff that you have to be able to,\nI'm gonna right click and\n\n406\n00:20:13.113 --> 00:20:14.973\ngo back to design view here, okay.\n\n407\n00:20:14.973 --> 00:20:17.767\nNotice I can change the tab order.\n\n408\n00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:20.778\nAnd you may have to do that\nas you start designing\n\n409\n00:20:20.778 --> 00:20:24.102\nforms on your own to bring\nthem more into alignment.\n\n410\n00:20:24.102 --> 00:20:29.812\nSo now that I've done this let me\nselect the employer and employee.\n\n411\n00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:32.061\nWait when did I duplicate that?\n\n412\n00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:34.650\nI shouldn't have done that, I should\nhave just done first name, last name.\n\n413\n00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.400\nOkay.\n\n414\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.505\nSo that's what happened there.\n\n415\n00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:42.105\nApparently, I duplicated the employee\nID of which I didn't realize I did.\n\n416\n00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:47.000\n[LAUGH] So if I just click and\ndrag these back up towards the top here.\n\n417\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.265\nLet me see if I can put these in the right\norder that I want them to be in.\n\n418\n00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:55.109\n&gt;&gt; A tab order is something that it is\nimportant because if you are going to\n\n419\n00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:59.605\nbe doing data entry and you're going to be\ncreating this for people to be doing it,\n\n420\n00:20:59.605 --> 00:21:03.542\nyou want them to kinda logically\ngo through, type, tab, type, tab.\n\n421\n00:21:03.542 --> 00:21:06.171\nAnd If it's jumping all over the place and\n\n422\n00:21:06.171 --> 00:21:10.242\nwhere you would put the fields,\nthat could be really annoying.\n\n423\n00:21:10.242 --> 00:21:14.200\nThat is something that as soon as you\nsaid that, I was like, yeah, of course,\n\n424\n00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.654\nbecause this is something you can always\ncontrol in a form is the tab order\n\n425\n00:21:17.654 --> 00:21:18.720\nfrom doing things.\n\n426\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.388\nLike Acrobat and\nsome other places where I've done stuff.\n\n427\n00:21:21.388 --> 00:21:24.709\nSo here it is, the great thing is,\nsince the way that I rearranged them,\n\n428\n00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:27.007\nit was actually in the order\nthat I placed them in.\n\n429\n00:21:27.007 --> 00:21:28.317\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But normally,\n\n430\n00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:30.490\nlet's say that this actually\ndid get out of order.\n\n431\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.351\nSo, let's say for example,\nthis actually ended up here and\n\n432\n00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:38.968\nthat's the tab order that access saw,\nall you have to do is click on it and\n\n433\n00:21:38.968 --> 00:21:43.460\nnotice that the cursor ends up having\nthat little kind of gray square.\n\n434\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.850\nThen I can drop it wherever I want\nto in between those two fields.\n\n435\n00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.504\nOnce I do that, I can click OK.\n\n436\n00:21:50.504 --> 00:21:53.345\nNow, there may come a point,\nVonne, where you go,\n\n437\n00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:57.690\nI don't know exactly what happened\nbecause I've got 45 fields in this form.\n\n438\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.970\nand it can happen.\n\n439\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.150\nYou can also choose this auto order.\n\n440\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.855\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that it\nwill always get every single one right.\n\n441\n00:22:04.855 --> 00:22:08.492\nBut at least at that point you get\nthem in some semblance of the order.\n\n442\n00:22:08.492 --> 00:22:11.824\nAnd then you can move around the ones that\njust didn't get into the order that you\n\n443\n00:22:11.824 --> 00:22:12.729\nwanted them to be in.\n\n444\n00:22:12.729 --> 00:22:14.428\nAnd then you're fine from that point.\n\n445\n00:22:14.428 --> 00:22:15.034\nOkay?\n\n446\n00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:18.393\nSo, using something like that\nactually does help us out.\n\n447\n00:22:18.393 --> 00:22:23.584\nAllows us to be able to add in the things\nthat we need to, to help us out as well.\n\n448\n00:22:23.584 --> 00:22:27.445\nNow there's another field that\nI also want to put in here too.\n\n449\n00:22:27.445 --> 00:22:31.812\nWhich is going to be existing field.\n\n450\n00:22:31.812 --> 00:22:36.284\nAnd then, let's say this is active and\ninactive instead.\n\n451\n00:22:36.284 --> 00:22:40.879\nNow, if I take a look at that one, that\none actually allows me to say whether or\n\n452\n00:22:40.879 --> 00:22:44.088\nnot this particular employee is active or\ninactive.\n\n453\n00:22:44.088 --> 00:22:45.872\nLet's change it over to the form view.\n\n454\n00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:49.595\nNotice I can actually just\nput a check box here.\n\n455\n00:22:49.595 --> 00:22:53.180\nJust to allow us to mark that as\nwell as we go through the form.\n\n456\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.707\n&gt;&gt; And just as a little side note, that\nactive inactive, we just added that for\n\n457\n00:22:57.707 --> 00:23:00.135\nthis particular file for this example.\n\n458\n00:23:00.135 --> 00:23:02.128\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because this is an example of\n\n459\n00:23:02.128 --> 00:23:03.760\na Boolean,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n460\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Data type, correct?\n\n461\n00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n462\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.900\nYep.\n\n463\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.162\nIt just gives us a yes or\nno that we can actually mark in place.\n\n464\n00:23:09.162 --> 00:23:10.515\nAnd that is what they call a Boolean.\n\n465\n00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:12.951\nIt's either on or it's off, and\n\n466\n00:23:12.951 --> 00:23:18.004\nit's just another example of a form,\nor a data control that we have.\n\n467\n00:23:18.004 --> 00:23:19.420\n&gt;&gt; And it did that automatically.\n\n468\n00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.211\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because of the data type that\n\n469\n00:23:21.211 --> 00:23:26.156\nwe created within a table as an on or off,\nso it's like how'd you get a check box?\n\n470\n00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.645\n&gt;&gt; That's the reason why.\n\n471\n00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:33.370\nBut to demonstrate the way that data types\ncan kinda work with your form control,\n\n472\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.485\nespecially for the Boolean.\n\n473\n00:23:35.485 --> 00:23:36.794\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n474\n00:23:36.794 --> 00:23:38.357\n&gt;&gt; So it gives us all of this\n\n475\n00:23:38.357 --> 00:23:41.888\ninformation that we can\njust start adding in, okay?\n\n476\n00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:47.165\nNow, Vonne, once we get the fields in and\nlet's just leave it at this for right now.\n\n477\n00:23:47.165 --> 00:23:51.802\nThere are of course things that we want to\nbe able to do, which is some formatting\n\n478\n00:23:51.802 --> 00:23:56.580\nthat we haven't really had a chance to get\ninto as well I wanna make some things look\n\n479\n00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.930\na little bit better, such as even\nthis idea of first and last name.\n\n480\n00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.820\nAll of that can actually be done as well,\nbut for us, at this point, right?\n\n481\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.130\nWe now have a working basic form, so\n\n482\n00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.620\nlet's just add in a couple\nof other elements here.\n\n483\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.675\nSo, I wanna do this for\nlet's say, we'll call it.\n\n484\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.860\nEmployee form for\nupdating tables or something.\n\n485\n00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.105\nHow do I do that?\nWhat if I don't have an actual field\n\n486\n00:24:23.105 --> 00:24:24.230\nVonne, okay?\n\n487\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.290\nBut I need to add in a title\nacross the top of this.\n\n488\n00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.500\nThis is where we go up to the design tab,\nand\n\n489\n00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.140\nin the control grouping,\nwhat I'm gonna look for is this one,\n\n490\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.480\nwhich is a label, now, that sounds silly,\nbut is actually going to help us out.\n\n491\n00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.760\nI'm gonna insert it right here at the top,\nso\n\n492\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.170\nI need to move these\ndown just a little bit.\n\n493\n00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.893\nSo I'm gonna select everything, simply\nmove this down, let's say, right here,\n\n494\n00:24:48.893 --> 00:24:52.420\nI'm just picking,\nit doesn't really matter exactly where,\n\n495\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.567\nthen I'm gonna click on the control.\n\n496\n00:24:56.432 --> 00:25:00.670\nAnd notice now that actually says,\nhey, what the actual type is too?\n\n497\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.840\nNow there's actually something\nelse that I should do, okay?\n\n498\n00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.290\nNormally, when you do, you select\na control and there's a basic wizard in\n\n499\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.330\nthe background that walks you through\nlike, do I need to add something?\n\n500\n00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.050\nDo I need to add, a field into this?\n\n501\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.360\nYou wanna make sure that this\nis actually checked or selected.\n\n502\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.010\nAnd notice how mine is actually\nkinda grey boxed here, okay.\n\n503\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.630\nThat means it's on, if there's\nsomething else that needs to be done\n\n504\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.770\nwhen I select this particular field and\nI put it in,\n\n505\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.180\nit's gonna tell me exactly\nwhat needs to be done.\n\n506\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.330\nSo I'm going to make sure that my\ncrosshair at the upper left-hand corner\n\n507\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.130\ngoes where I think it's\ngonna go in the form.\n\n508\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.430\nSo, I'm gonna place it,\nthis is always exciting, isn't it Vonne?\n\n509\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:49.026\nOkay, so\nwe'll just call this one update, Update.\n\n510\n00:25:49.026 --> 00:25:50.587\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why can't I spell update?\n\n511\n00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:55.035\nUpdate or add employee info.\n\n512\n00:25:55.035 --> 00:26:01.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's so hard to type\nwhen everybody watching, isn't it?\n\n513\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:01.935\n&gt;&gt; I know, isn't it?\n\n514\n00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:03.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know\nwhat it is about that.\n\n515\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:04.970\nAnd you just clicked on it.\n\n516\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.530\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; You didn't Click+Hold+Drag\n\n517\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.390\nto make the box.\n\n518\n00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.710\nIt was just Click, type.\n\n519\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.260\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n520\n00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:09.980\n&gt;&gt; Click and type and\n\n521\n00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.890\nyou'll notice it automatically expands\nto where we want it to be, okay?\n\n522\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.830\nNow, it's now looking for\nsomething to attach to.\n\n523\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:22.500\n&gt;&gt; So if you see that little\ngreen corner right up here and\n\n524\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.430\nyou click on it,\nnotice that it actually says.\n\n525\n00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.240\nLet me see if I can make it show up again.\n\n526\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.060\nThis is a new label and\nnot associated with any control.\n\n527\n00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.520\nIt assumed that you are gonna associate\nthis with a control of some sort.\n\n528\n00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.280\nBut even if you don't, all you have to do\nis click and tell it to ignore the error.\n\n529\n00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.810\nOr you can just select as\na new unassociated label,\n\n530\n00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.370\nwhich is what it is, and\nit's not gonna allow you to do it.\n\n531\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.003\nSo if I just select ignore that error,\nthat's all we have to do, okay?\n\n532\n00:26:50.003 --> 00:26:53.950\nFrom that point on, I want this to\nactually appear a little bit larger.\n\n533\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.790\nThis is just the only basic\nformatting we're doing.\n\n534\n00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.940\nWe've still got actually a little\nbit more that we've gotta do,\n\n535\n00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.960\nbut I'm starting to run low on time, so\nthat actually means that we would probably\n\n536\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.560\ngo a little bit further\ninto this series as well.\n\n537\n00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.830\n&gt;&gt; Our forms mini series.\n\n538\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.175\n&gt;&gt; Our forms mini series.\n\n539\n00:27:09.175 --> 00:27:11.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I've selected the format tab at this\n\n540\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:17.990\npoint, and then I'm going to click on,\nlet's say, the Calibri header here.\n\n541\n00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.500\nLet's make it 24 point font, why not?\n\n542\n00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.970\nJust so it stands out a little bit more.\n\n543\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.040\n&gt;&gt; Can you make it pink?\n\n544\n00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.385\n&gt;&gt; We can make it pink.\n\n545\n00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:27.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I can find pink.\n\n546\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.400\nAll right Vonne.\n\n547\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.370\nIs that pink up here?\n\n548\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:32.970\n&gt;&gt; That's purple.\n\n549\n00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.262\nYou go to the standard tab up there at\nthe top cuz it automatically went on pick.\n\n550\n00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:38.860\nThere you go.\nPick one of those fuchsia pinkies.\n\n551\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.410\n&gt;&gt; This one?\n\n552\n00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.110\nThis one?\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n553\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nThere you go.\n\n554\n00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.331\nClick OK.\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n\n555\n00:27:43.331 --> 00:27:44.174\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n556\n00:27:44.174 --> 00:27:46.195\n[LAUGH] cuz that's really important.\n\n557\n00:27:46.195 --> 00:27:47.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n558\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.710\n&gt;&gt; It really is, okay?\n\n559\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.630\nSo there we go, Update or\nAdd Employee Info for right now, okay?\n\n560\n00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.560\nSo this gives us this ability\nto actually go back in, and\n\n561\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.800\nnow we can start updating or\nadding in information that we have.\n\n562\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.882\nSo it does help.\n\n563\n00:28:02.882 --> 00:28:05.360\nWe do have to use a combination,\n\n564\n00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.760\nour navigational tools as well as\nbeing able to add in new information.\n\n565\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.490\nAnd if I want a new record,\nI just simply click on the New Record, and\n\n566\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.390\nthis is where I can start adding in\nthe information, and mark it and\n\n567\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.637\nthen continue forward from that point.\n\n568\n00:28:19.637 --> 00:28:24.030\nNow, Vonne, there's actually a bit\nmore to that I wanted to show, but\n\n569\n00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.370\nI just realized again,\nthat I talked way too long.\n\n570\n00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that means we need to do a little\n\n571\n00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:33.020\nbit more cuz there's more on formatting,\ndefinitely a lot more that we wanna show,\n\n572\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.150\nbut will not have time for\nit this episode.\n\n573\n00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.370\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you added that label in,\nsince it was a label,\n\n574\n00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:43.890\nI'm also assuming that the ones it added\nfor us, we could go back in and modify.\n\n575\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:48.357\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because maybe the field name doesn't\n\n576\n00:28:48.357 --> 00:28:52.252\nreally make sense to our endusers.\n\n577\n00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:57.180\nI'm seeing this is right down my alley\nto where I wanna start getting in there.\n\n578\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.380\nIt was already starting to annoy me,\nnot annoy me.\n\n579\n00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.420\nThose aren't lined up.\n\n580\n00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.150\nThat needs to be a little bit longer.\n\n581\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.880\nThat's just my design OCD.\n\n582\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.280\n&gt;&gt; That's a part of what\nwe need to show Vonne.\n\n583\n00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a part we need to show.\n\n584\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.409\n&gt;&gt; Can I just drive for a minute?\n\n585\n00:29:10.409 --> 00:29:11.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me move that over and\n\n586\n00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.870\neverything like that.\n\n587\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.101\nBut I want to let the master do his work,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:29:15.101 --> 00:29:15.970\n&gt;&gt; So, but thank you so much, and\n\n589\n00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.960\nthank you for all my questions,\nand realizing ' yeah,\n\n590\n00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.120\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n591\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.470\nBut what is going to happen is we're\ngoing to come back with a Part 4\n\n592\n00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:26.670\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n593\n00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.860\n&gt;&gt; In our formsmens series.\n\n594\n00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.560\nBut let's go ahead and wrap up this\nepisode, signing off for Office Pro TV,\n\n595\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.077\nI've been your host Vonne Smith,\n&gt;&gt;

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:21.145\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\nthis is the Access 2016 Essentials show.\n\n4\n00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:25.655\nAnd we are specifically talking about\ncreating reports in this episode.\n\n5\n00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.315\nAnd here to help us with this is Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:29.552\nHello.\nHow are you?\n\n7\n00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:31.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine Vonne.\n\n8\n00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:36.700\nOnce again back here at OfficePro Studios\nand ready to actually get started and\n\n9\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.360\none of our final sections\nin taking look at access.\n\n10\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.280\nRemember that what we've actually\ncovered so far is not only of course\n\n11\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360\nunderstanding the basics\nof database design.\n\n12\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.280\nWe didn't really jumped super deep into\nit but least enough to get you started.\n\n13\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.360\nWe also showed you where you could take\nthat information and create the tables,\n\n14\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.605\nthe structures that's gonna\nhold your information.\n\n15\n00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:01.434\nAllowed you to also see\nclearing the information\n\n16\n00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:05.505\nthat you can verify that your design\nis correct as well as be able to pull\n\n17\n00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.688\nthe information out of your\ndatabase that you need to.\n\n18\n00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:12.373\nAnd then we also, of course,\ncreated different forms, and\n\n19\n00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:16.150\nnow we are into the aspects\nof talking about reports.\n\n20\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.800\nSo that is what we're actually taking\na look at is this idea of actually\n\n21\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.280\ngenerating reports off of the data\nthat exist in our database, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.190\nSo, Vonne, when we start to take a look\nat this particular aspect of it,\n\n23\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.930\nit is actually something that sounds easy.\n\n24\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.905\nMost of us have dealt with reports before,\nwhen we've all seen them but\n\n25\n00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.630\nVonne we've also seen bad reports as well,\nokay?\n\n26\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.286\nSo that's why we want to make sure\nthat we understand when we talk\n\n27\n00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:49.315\nabout building reports that we need\nto actually build good reports.\n\n28\n00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:51.695\nAnd that's what Access can help us to do.\n\n29\n00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.295\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, like you just said,\nwe have the questions with the query.\n\n30\n00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.265\nWe had the input, which was the forms.\n\n31\n00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.525\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And now we're doing\n\n32\n00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:01.325\nthe output which is the reports.\n\n33\n00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:04.193\nIt's like your bosses come up to you and\nsaid okay,\n\n34\n00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.147\nI'd love to have that TPS report.\n\n35\n00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:09.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you could have it by Friday that'll\n\n36\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.820\nbe great.\n\n37\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.090\nI know, yes, that's a lame joke but\nI can't help it, it's so\n\n38\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.720\nawesome, it's iconic.\n\n39\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.340\nBut that's really where we're at,\nwe're making a blah, blah,\n\n40\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.175\nblah report, TPS report.\n\n41\n00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:22.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this is what ends\n\n42\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.270\nup happening, kay Vonne?\n\n43\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.100\nSo most of the people end up using some\ntype of relational database system.\n\n44\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.090\nThey understand that they generate\nreports but they may not understand why\n\n45\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.110\nthe reports are generated\nthe way that they are generated.\n\n46\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.480\nAnd that can lead to some confusion,\nbecause a lot of times you\n\n47\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.760\nhand this report and you look at it and\nyou like, what is this telling me?\n\n48\n00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.740\nAnd that's were the real issue comes in.\n\n49\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.150\nWhat we need to be able to do is we need\nto understand not only have access to\n\n50\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.050\nhelps us to generate reports, but also why\nwe actually need good reports as well.\n\n51\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nLike we're getting the answer but\n\n52\n00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.105\nthe answer doesn't make any sense.\n\n53\n00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:01.030\n[LAUGH] And I've had that before.\n\n54\n00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.750\nI have all this and\nwhat does this actually mean?\n\n55\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n56\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.230\nif you have to kind of explain your way\nthrough your report and your answer,\n\n57\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.060\nthat's where the proper, not just\nformatting but just making sure you\n\n58\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.500\nadd all the elements that are needed and\nso on and so forth so yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.510\nClear reporting would be very good.\n\n60\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the kind of worst comment about\nyour report is not that it's a bad report,\n\n61\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.766\nI know that sounds weird, right?\n\n62\n00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:32.670\nBecause bad report can mean, hey we\ngot data and it doesn't look good for\n\n63\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.580\nus, and that seems to make sense.\n\n64\n00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.670\nBut is when you hand\nthe report to somebody and\n\n65\n00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.790\nthey ask you, what does this data mean?\n\n66\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.440\nWell, your report should be indicating\nwhat that data means without you having to\n\n67\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.970\nreally explain it too much, besides maybe\na title on your report that you have.\n\n68\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.780\nIt should need much more explanation.\n\n69\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.240\nNow don't get me wrong,\npeople ask for clarification.\n\n70\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.170\nBut overall though, the report\nshould say what needs to be said.\n\n71\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.980\nSo what are some examples that we're\ntalking about in terms of reports that can\n\n72\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.100\nreally be overwhelming.\n\n73\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.040\nWell, one is that you get a report and\nit has too much data in it.\n\n74\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.340\nSo when somebody hands you that report and\nyou're expected to see one or\n\n75\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.980\ntwo pages, and it turns out to be\nten pages long, you're a little\n\n76\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.270\nbit more overwhelmed by that,\nbecause you start to realize something.\n\n77\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.270\nYou're not gonna find the information\nthat you need in what you expected so\n\n78\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.970\nthey're gonna make you dig for\n\n79\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.680\nthe information through ten pages of\nthis report that they've handed you.\n\n80\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.390\nAnd more than likely that means\nthat they've handed you too much\n\n81\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.920\ninformation, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.010\nAnd the reason behind that is because\npeople that end up writing reports\n\n83\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.010\na lot of times, they don't understand what\nthe end result is supposed to do for them.\n\n84\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.830\nSo we're gonna talk about that in a little\nbit when we were designing the reports\n\n85\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.790\nthat we're actually gonna design.\n\n86\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.530\nAlso, if they give you data\nthat seems to be extraneous,\n\n87\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.530\nlet's say for example that you end\nup taking a look at your report, and\n\n88\n00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.580\nyou start to wonder why is this\nparticular field being reported on.\n\n89\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.610\nThe person handing out the report,\nthe person explaining it,\n\n90\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.505\ndidn't even address it in the whole time\nthat they were talking about the report.\n\n91\n00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:13.720\nWell when you have something like that,\nright, you gotta realize that somebody\n\n92\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.950\nended up putting that in there,\nthinking that it might be addressed.\n\n93\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.500\nBut data without context\nis essentially meaningless.\n\n94\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.380\nSo adding in meaningless data is\njust about as overwhelming as it\n\n95\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.530\nis when you actually have too much data\nbeing displayed in the report as well.\n\n96\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.124\nSo, we need to learn how to kind of filter\nout some of the information that we don't\n\n97\n00:05:35.124 --> 00:05:36.730\nwant showing up too, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.790\nThe other thing that can end up happening\nis that you give the wrong report to\n\n99\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.410\nthe wrong person.\n\n100\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.280\nNow it doesn't mean that they\ndidn't ask for that information.\n\n101\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.470\nBut it means that you didn't\nunderstand who your particular\n\n102\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.670\naudience ended up being.\n\n103\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.960\nSo now they're looking at information\nthat may be relevant to them but\n\n104\n00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.420\nthey didn't actually understand\nwhat was handed to them.\n\n105\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.960\nSo it would be something like this.\n\n106\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.290\nNow where we work, we are highly\ntechnical in everything that we do,\n\n107\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.550\nwhether we're where we are, or whether\nI should talking about our CEO as well.\n\n108\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.080\nHe can understand a lot of\nthe things that we might say and do.\n\n109\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.700\nBut if I actually had someone that didn't\nhave that background or the technology and\n\n110\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.150\nstuff, if I handed them a report that had\nall these technical figures in it and\n\n111\n00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.500\ntalked all this information and\nthe data points and all that.\n\n112\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.680\nHe might look at me like\nI didn't need this,\n\n113\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.760\nI just really needed what I needed and\nnot all this other stuff.\n\n114\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.890\nThat's why we have to be very careful.\n\n115\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.740\n&gt;&gt; Philip, somebody that worked for\nthis here our company.\n\n116\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.820\nHe gets into all these different\nnumbers of terms and burns, and\n\n117\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.040\nhe's using a lot of jargon,\nshowing me all this stuff.\n\n118\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.194\nAnd I was like wait, so\nhow many members do we have?\n\n119\n00:06:50.194 --> 00:06:54.250\n[LAUGH] It's one of those, but that's\nvery specific to what he is showing.\n\n120\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.180\nHe's showing you all these figures.\n\n121\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.830\nYou just wanted to see how\nmany total members we have or\n\n122\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.510\nhow many total number we have for\nthis month, those types of things.\n\n123\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.170\nI think that's kind of like the scope.\n\n124\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.934\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWe're talking about scope,\n\n125\n00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:11.080\ncreate before and target audience,\nall of those different things.\n\n126\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.760\nOr this is more of\nthe theoretical part of forms but\n\n127\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.410\nit's extremely important cuz,\nwell you're in an office setting and\n\n128\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.430\nyou need to make sure that you have all\nof these parts when you're doing them.\n\n129\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.693\n&gt;&gt; It's more important than we realized\nbecause if we start off with not\n\n130\n00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:29.523\nunderstanding who are audience is we'll\nmore than likely either overwhelm them\n\n131\n00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:32.676\nwith the information or\nthey'll take a look at the information and\n\n132\n00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:34.720\nnot understand what is there.\n\n133\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.750\nSo having a solid understanding\nof this is actually what helped\n\n134\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.380\nyou to develop a good report in the end\nof what you also need to be able to do.\n\n135\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.460\n&gt;&gt; And it's kinda like,\njust because you know your data,\n\n136\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.958\ndoesn't mean somebody else\nknows the data the same way.\n\n137\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.312\nI mean, cuz if you're going to\nbe in access and developing and\n\n138\n00:07:51.312 --> 00:07:55.454\nbuilding the things that we're going\nthrough the queries and everything.\n\n139\n00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:59.866\nYou're gonna have a much more intimate\nrelationship with this data so\n\n140\n00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:04.664\nyou're gonna know it really well and\nthe other people they don't see that.\n\n141\n00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:07.702\nJust the same with Philip,\nknowing all about our sales and\n\n142\n00:08:07.702 --> 00:08:09.635\nthat kind of aspect of the business.\n\n143\n00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:13.020\nWhere we are not really\nassociated with that.\n\n144\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.800\nSo it's just to each its own, but\nmake sure it's translatable [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n146\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.750\nthat target is really important for\nwhat we want to be able to understand.\n\n147\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.010\nAnd of course that means that we also have\nto focus in on the purpose of our report\n\n148\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.050\nas well.\n\n149\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.910\nNow, the idea of purpose is\nvery important in the end.\n\n150\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.650\nWe can pull out whatever numbers\nthat we want to from our data.\n\n151\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.510\nI guarantee you you can do it.\n\n152\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.150\nYou can also take the data and\nmanipulate it to show what you want to do\n\n153\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.200\nby using some advanced filtering\nif you choose to do that.\n\n154\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.743\nYou can even make somebody look\nbad if you want to as well, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:48.743 --> 00:08:51.100\nSo all that can be done.\n\n156\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.010\nBut in the end, you have to know what\nthe purpose of your report is gonna be.\n\n157\n00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.350\nThe majority of times when someone is\nasking for a report, for a database,\n\n158\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.030\nit usually is not just simple\ncuriosity that ends up happening.\n\n159\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.880\nBut it is because somebody is trying\nto make business decisions based off of\n\n160\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.440\nthe data that they are looking to take or\nthey are trying to take a look at, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.530\nSo in other words, it's very important\nthat we present the right data,\n\n162\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.630\nin the right format,\nat the right time of everything.\n\n163\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.700\nSo that what can be presented at\nthat point is accurate data, so\n\n164\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:36.180\nthat they can make good solid business\ndecisions based off of that report.\n\n165\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.420\nAnd when they can't do that\nbecause the report is wrong,\n\n166\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.810\nit's not that the data and\nthe figures are wrong.\n\n167\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.130\nIt's that the report that's generated is\none of those things that we talked about.\n\n168\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.680\nAnd that's why it's very important that we\nat least have that solid understanding of\n\n169\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:56.900\nworking in terms of building a good report\nwhen we're asked to build this report.\n\n170\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.090\nSo this is one of those things where\nworking with the forms as we did before\n\n171\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.330\nhelps us tremendously, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.700\nBecause building a form and\n\n173\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.230\nbuilding report is not super different\nin terms of layout in some measures.\n\n174\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.810\nBut when we get into how the data's\ngonna be displayed, you're gonna see\n\n175\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.000\nthat is gonna be much more different\nthan what we think it's going to be.\n\n176\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.707\nSo it's important that we\nunderstand that as we get started.\n\n177\n00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:29.430\nSo don't overlook this fact of the few\nminutes that we've been talking here and\n\n178\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.167\ndiscussing the idea why is it\nimportant that we need reports and\n\n179\n00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:34.380\nwhy we use reports.\n\n180\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.028\nBecause if we overlook this and just\nthink I'm just gonna build my reports,\n\n181\n00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:41.904\nif you do get that comment, I don't know\nwhat this data is telling me, unless you\n\n182\n00:10:41.904 --> 00:10:45.666\nhaven't built it correctly, so go back and\ntake a look at those situations and\n\n183\n00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:49.910\nthose elements that we've just been\ntalking about in a few minutes, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.270\nSo when we build a report, okay,\n\n185\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.880\nwe wanna make sure that we understand\nthere's several elements involved in it.\n\n186\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.370\nAnd then we'll jump into, of course,\nthe idea of trying to build a report or\n\n187\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.920\ntwo as well, okay,\nusing the tools in Access.\n\n188\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.120\nNow, let's take a look at\nmy machine right here.\n\n189\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.210\nAnd this is an example of a report.\n\n190\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.880\nNow, Vonne,\nI don't wanna scare you here, okay.\n\n191\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.230\nThis is done on purpose in terms\nof the the unusual formatting.\n\n192\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry I just looked up and\n\n193\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.840\nI went,\nI made a little sounds if you heard that.\n\n194\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.684\nIt's like me being a little jarred by\nthe color combination you [LAUGH].\n\n195\n00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:27.386\n&gt;&gt; By the actual coloring and\nwe'll try and change the coloring up,\n\n196\n00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:31.354\njust a little bit, but if I we're to\npresent to you a report like this,\n\n197\n00:11:31.354 --> 00:11:33.197\nthat's actually a good thing.\n\n198\n00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:35.822\nBecause all of a sudden\nyou start realizing,\n\n199\n00:11:35.822 --> 00:11:38.732\nRonnie may actually be colorblind,\none, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:43.056\nTwo, right, it's so jarring as far as\njust the formatting goes in terms of\n\n201\n00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:45.873\nthe colors and\nthe way that they're presented,\n\n202\n00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:49.530\nthat you might not actually\nbe able to look at it, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.800\nAnd so, even just the formatting\nitself is enough to throw people off.\n\n204\n00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.320\n&gt;&gt; But I do like the idea of using\nmaybe this kind of background color,\n\n205\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.760\nif I will call it, to separate it out.\n\n206\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.290\nSo it's almost like when you want\nto do the changing of the rows,\n\n207\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.970\nwhere one row is kinda darker grey and\nI can't find the, alternating colors!\n\n208\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.540\nThere.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, alternating rows, right?\n\n209\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it helps your eye travel\nalong down so like right here,\n\n210\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:26.100\neven just simple colorings of different\nsections, if you wanna say, could help.\n\n211\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.470\nMaybe not too crazy on the colors,\n\n212\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.910\nbut at least it kind of gives your eye\na quick way of knowing which is what.\n\n213\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:38.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you can see that we're\ngonna pretty much rebuild this particular\n\n214\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.490\nreport as we jump into it and when we\nstart creating custom reports here.\n\n215\n00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.580\nBut at the beginning, I wanted to show\nyou an example of a report, right?\n\n216\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.410\nAnd this report you can see\njust by the title itself, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.720\nIs Sales by Categories, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.690\nSo, inside of our database, we did\nhave essentially all of our products\n\n219\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.340\nseparated out and\nactually marked out in what?\n\n220\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.720\nTwo different category, that there is\na Category and there's a SubCategory,\n\n221\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.890\nwe even have a Manufacturer\nidentified as well.\n\n222\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.080\nAnd then the individual pieces in here.\n\n223\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.078\n&gt;&gt; Well, even by just looking at this\nright now, I can see that, all right,\n\n224\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:20.369\nwe're looking at Toto's Tutus,\nand that's what we're,\n\n225\n00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:24.261\nthese are the items that we sold\nunder this particular manufacturer.\n\n226\n00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:27.670\n&gt;&gt; , Right.\n&gt;&gt; And the way that you kind of spaced it,\n\n227\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.140\nwhere it's underneath almost like\n\n228\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.360\na bullet,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n229\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.880\n&gt;&gt; Or just like a gelling down, that right\nthere is another visual indication for\n\n230\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.390\nme of what we're looking at, and\nof course, you can say out of it.\n\n231\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.142\nYou can always bold that too, [LAUGH] but,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n232\n00:13:41.142 --> 00:13:45.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you Ronnie,\nI'm liking this [LAUGH].\n\n233\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.305\n&gt;&gt; So, it actually does show you,\nyou're sleeting your eye, as, as long you\n\n234\n00:13:50.305 --> 00:13:55.940\nkind of see that and without me explaining\nto Vonne what is actually happening here.\n\n235\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.246\nIs that she was able to pick all of that\nout by herself without me having to go,\n\n236\n00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:02.770\nall right, Vonne, let me tell you\nwhat you're looking at right here.\n\n237\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.520\nIt's laid out in a manner and\na fashion that she can take a look at.\n\n238\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.590\nAnd then, underneath that manufacturer,\nshe can start seeing all those amazing\n\n239\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.490\nDoggie Dazzler collars that we have-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.000\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much sold.\n\n241\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.960\nAnd a bow tie collar which\nshould be as embarrassing for\n\n242\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.305\na dog as I'm embarrassed by myself, okay?\n\n243\n00:14:22.305 --> 00:14:22.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n244\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.450\nyou can actually see\nsome of that information.\n\n245\n00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.400\nAs I scroll on through,\nyou can also see that there's another\n\n246\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.740\nsubcategory here where I broke it\nfrom the previous subcategory.\n\n247\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.150\nSo before where we had whatever it was,\ncallers or something?\n\n248\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Could we go up one more?\n\n249\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.620\nDo you mind, sorry,\nI just wanted to make sure.\n\n250\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.510\nCuz the category's accessories.\n\n251\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.300\nSo we're still in the main\ncategory of accessories and\n\n252\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.510\nnow this is the subcallers of dogs and\nthe manufacturers.\n\n253\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.830\nAnd now we're getting to\nanother subcategory of travel.\n\n254\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.150\nBecause there's two different\nmanufacturers, all because of the green.\n\n255\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n256\n00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.930\n&gt;&gt; Look at you.\n&gt;&gt; There you go, you see.\n\n257\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:06.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nManufacturer there for accessories and and\n\n258\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.255\nthe travel sub category of accessories.\n\n259\n00:15:09.255 --> 00:15:11.280\nOops, I got it [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.660\n&gt;&gt; And then you can see where the next\ncategory began where we have dog clothing.\n\n261\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.620\n&gt;&gt; Main level.\n\n262\n00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.270\n&gt;&gt; Which again, I find embarrassing\nthat we're clothing dogs here, and\n\n263\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.032\nwe actually have costumes for dogs.\n\n264\n00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:25.930\nSo, I guess these dogs are really\nhitting it up high here.\n\n265\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:30.919\nSo, you can see where there's a lot of\nthis information also continuing to show\n\n266\n00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:32.120\nup as well, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.755\nSo, all these kind of did break\napart in what we needed them to do.\n\n268\n00:15:36.755 --> 00:15:38.455\nEven shirts, go figure!\n\n269\n00:15:38.455 --> 00:15:41.505\nDo we have pants,\nby chance did you add in pants?\n\n270\n00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:43.580\n&gt;&gt; No, I left the pants out but,\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank goodness.\n\n271\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So somewhere along the line I was like,\n\n272\n00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:49.045\nI'm gonna run into pants here and\nI know that's gonna happen.\n\n273\n00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:51.735\nBut you can see why breaking this apart,\nright?\n\n274\n00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:54.140\nAnd setting it up in the way they want to.\n\n275\n00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.487\nMakes it easy without\na lot of explanation,\n\n276\n00:15:56.487 --> 00:16:00.240\nVonne was able to figure out the way\nthat I had to report laid out for us.\n\n277\n00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.892\nAnd that is part of is what\nwe want to be able to do.\n\n278\n00:16:02.892 --> 00:16:07.621\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure there's tons of different\noptions of like, summarizing and\n\n279\n00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:12.770\nhow you want to display it but I think\nthis is a great example to get started.\n\n280\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.102\nThe basic idea of how you want to\nlay it out cuz somebody be like,\n\n281\n00:16:16.102 --> 00:16:18.780\nwell I would have laid it\nout completely different.\n\n282\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.890\nWell, that's fine, but\nit's just those main points of,\n\n283\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.250\nI can read this really quickly as\nblue indicates the top level change.\n\n284\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:34.732\nThe orange is like the subcategory and\nthe green is like the next level down.\n\n285\n00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:35.779\nSo [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n286\n00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.876\nwe're gonna actually show\nyou how to do all that.\n\n287\n00:16:37.876 --> 00:16:41.373\nThat's the thing is show you how to\nactually kind of group these together in\n\n288\n00:16:41.373 --> 00:16:42.406\na way that we want to.\n\n289\n00:16:42.406 --> 00:16:46.486\nNow, Vonne, there's also another element\nin this that doesn't appear anywhere\n\n290\n00:16:46.486 --> 00:16:48.910\ninside of our database, okay.\n\n291\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.760\nSo, Vonne, I know that there is\na quantity field in the sales tape, okay?\n\n292\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.690\nI know that.\n\n293\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.860\nThe unit price, though,\nis inside of our products table, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.920\nBut notice this, Vonne,\nright over here, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.852\nThere's a totals field as well.\n\n296\n00:17:03.852 --> 00:17:08.140\nWhere it did take quantity, and looks\nlike it multiplied it by unit price, and\n\n297\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.830\nit gave us this number over here as well.\n\n298\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:17.870\nAnd you can see like the one directed\nhere six of these Happy Paws T-shirts.\n\n299\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.880\nYeah, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.227\nAnd unit price of $3.50 and multiplied\nit out for that $21 over here too.\n\n301\n00:17:23.227 --> 00:17:25.530\nSo notice that that actually appeared and\n\n302\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.350\nit's nowhere inside of our database,\nVonne.\n\n303\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI had another lightbulb moment here.\n\n304\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.980\nBecause while we were building all of\nthis, I was like why wouldn't we wanna go\n\n305\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.100\nahead and have the total price\nin the sales in the tables?\n\n306\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Like I kept asking that, remember?\n\n307\n00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.260\nAnd you're like no, no,\nwe're not gonna do that here.\n\n308\n00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:44.860\nI'm like why?\n\n309\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.278\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n310\n00:17:46.278 --> 00:17:51.360\nIt's because it's the reports that we want\nto generate that, that doesn't mean that\n\n311\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.940\nthe raw data if you want to say,\n&gt;&gt; That's in the tables,\n\n312\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.170\nthe reports is where we can\ndo this calculated field\n\n313\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.726\nof see, it's just one of those,\n&gt;&gt; There\n\n314\n00:18:01.726 --> 00:18:04.240\nyou go,\n&gt;&gt; Another aha moment of kind of bringing\n\n315\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.240\nAccess all together\nformulas to why we need to,\n\n316\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.650\nseparate those things out into their\ncorrect compartments if you wanna say.\n\n317\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.810\nThe tables and the queries and\nthe reports then, well,\n\n318\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.080\nthe form is another reports that's.\n\n319\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling very good over here,\n\n320\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.350\nI'm feeling very smart.\n\n321\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and Vonne is referring back to\nwhen were talking about the design right?\n\n322\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.860\nThat she did.\n\n323\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.460\nShe wanted us to go ahead and put a totals\ncolumn there, and I kinda had to say no,\n\n324\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.466\nwe'll do that inside of reports,\nand really wasn't clicking it.\n\n325\n00:18:34.466 --> 00:18:38.170\nAnd the reason is why it doesn't click for\nmost of us, why wouldn't we wanna do this?\n\n326\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.140\nVonne, if I continue to add in more sales,\nright, if I went ahead and\n\n327\n00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.320\nstacked that in here, okay?\n\n328\n00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.320\nWell that means that these would\nactually be fixed, which is fine, but\n\n329\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.920\nthose other new ones, right?\n\n330\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.880\nWe'd have to actually continually to make\nsure that those get added in as we run\n\n331\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.350\nthis report again.\n\n332\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.620\nNow with it generated like this,\nif somebody were to change the order,\n\n333\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.440\neven in mid flight like right now,\n\n334\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.480\nand somebody updated the database,\nall I'd have to do is refresh this report.\n\n335\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.540\nAnd if it happened even in live time,\nit would refresh it right here\n\n336\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.270\nbecause it's generating it on the fly,\nit's not having to actually go and\n\n337\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.100\nfind that field and then pull it in,\nit's doing it live right here.\n\n338\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.225\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of back\nto the queries right?\n\n339\n00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:17.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it is.\n&gt;&gt; Where you\n\n340\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.370\nwould say it's all stored there, and\n\n341\n00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.060\nall you have to do is run the query again-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n342\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.660\n&gt;&gt; It's the same idea here with the\nreports, it's like the report is built.\n\n343\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.410\nIt's not necessarily run it again.\n\n344\n00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.830\nThis is now refresh the report and\nit's gonna pull it.\n\n345\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.325\nMan, this Access is pretty cool.\n\n346\n00:19:34.325 --> 00:19:35.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really can.\n\n347\n00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.820\nIt does have a lot of elements to it,\nokay.\n\n348\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.718\nSo when we start to do\nsomething like this,\n\n349\n00:19:40.718 --> 00:19:44.830\nthe key here is not that you make a report\nto look like mine cuz that's plain ugly.\n\n350\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.750\nAnd I did do this on purpose so\nwhen people go, Ronnie, that's terrible,\n\n351\n00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.210\nyou should never do that.\n\n352\n00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.970\nI did it so that when we get into this and\nwe start to make it,\n\n353\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.730\nI'll show you the reason\nwhy I did it as well so\n\n354\n00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.560\nthat we can mark it off easily and\ndistinguish when we need it to.\n\n355\n00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.090\nBut you'll be able to do it by placement\nand you'll be able to do it by colors.\n\n356\n00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.060\nYou'll be able to add in a lot more\ninformation than what I have here\n\n357\n00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.050\nas just a simple example.\n\n358\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.420\nSo the great things has gone as\nwe've now also already done forms\n\n359\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.530\na lot of that information forms is\ngoing to essentially help us out here\n\n360\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.710\nas we get started in taking a look\nat the creation of reports too.\n\n361\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this kinda look like,\nfields or controls,\n\n362\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.130\nwe call them controls in the forms.\n\n363\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.740\nAnd they're just that,\nI still call them form fields.\n\n364\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.850\n&gt;&gt; Yep, they are.\n\n365\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.740\nHere's a report field.\n\n366\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nCuz it's still kinda\n\n367\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.660\nlooks like a report cuz we have\na label that looks like and.\n\n368\n00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Do we call them controls in reports?\n\n369\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.373\n&gt;&gt; Nope, these are actually\njust called fields in reports.\n\n370\n00:20:42.373 --> 00:20:44.034\n&gt;&gt; Okay, they're only called fields, okay.\n\n371\n00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:45.140\nI love how they flip those\nwords around for us.\n\n372\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.337\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, it's kinda neat.\n\n373\n00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:48.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean it's look very,\nvery similar and\n\n374\n00:20:48.756 --> 00:20:52.230\nI'm sure all the stuff we do with\nalignments is gonna be the same.\n\n375\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n376\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.320\n&gt;&gt; And if you want the label\nto be different, yeah.\n\n377\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this will be a little bit more\nchallenging, though, I promise you this.\n\n378\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.470\nAs easy as it sounds, cuz you go forms,\nI've got that one licked.\n\n379\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.130\nWhen we get into Report Writer, you're\ngonna actually see something that you\n\n380\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:13.100\nhaven't seen before, and it's gonna look\na little bit confusing, I guarantee you.\n\n381\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you warned me,\ncuz I was like okay, this looks very.\n\n382\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.790\nHe's like no,\n\n383\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.430\nwhen we get to this part, that's,\nI think it's designer, is that what it is?\n\n384\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we get into Report Designer,\nyou'll see.\n\n385\n00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and he's like no,\nit's way different than you think.\n\n386\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.701\nSee, you're already setting the stage for\nanother mini series.\n\n387\n00:21:29.701 --> 00:21:32.506\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of cliff hangers and dips and dots and\n\n388\n00:21:32.506 --> 00:21:33.651\nwhere are we gonna go?\n\n389\n00:21:33.651 --> 00:21:36.790\nSo I'm on the boat.\n\n390\n00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.570\n&gt;&gt; So, Vonne, it's right here, right?\n\n391\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.820\nI really want us to kind of leave\nwith this and get, dive in to Access.\n\n392\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.260\nSo even though we have a few more\nminutes left, let's go ahead and\n\n393\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.850\nkind of sign off for this one.\n\n394\n00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.300\nAnd then we'll get started into\nactually building some reports.\n\n395\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.420\nAnd we'll use some of\nthe built in tools and\n\n396\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.965\nthen we'll kind of save another episode or\ntwo or three, who knows, for\n\n397\n00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:02.840\nthe actual report designer and show you\nhow to actually build a report that's very\n\n398\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.950\nsimilar to this if not exactly this\none again with different colors.\n\n399\n00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.838\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou are the master of the miniseries.\n\n400\n00:22:09.838 --> 00:22:10.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n401\n00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.990\nI feel you've set the stage\nreally well for us.\n\n402\n00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.430\nI had another aha moment and\nI'm feeling a little sassy right now.\n\n403\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm like yeah, we can do this.\n\n404\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.795\n&gt;&gt; Sass away.\n\n405\n00:22:20.795 --> 00:22:25.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm really excited for\nwhat's to come, and setting the stage for\n\n406\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.560\nour foreshadowing and\nour wonderful episodes to come in reports.\n\n407\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.390\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n408\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.400\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n409\n00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n410\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.501\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n411\n00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:42.504\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:19.902\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith and\nthis is Access 2016 Essentials.\n\n4\n00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:25.498\nAnd we're continuing on with out part two\nof reporting in our report miniseries.\n\n5\n00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:30.680\nThere's so many miniseries, it's like\nyou've got mini shows in a show in a show.\n\n6\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.458\nAnd here in the starring role\nis Mr Ronnie Wong, hello.\n\n7\n00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hi Vonne, thank you again for\n\n8\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.166\nmaking fun of me,\ndragging out topics as long as I can.\n\n9\n00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.548\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you know that's my job,\n\n10\n00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:42.615\nand I love it.\n\n11\n00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:44.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\n\n12\n00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.630\nas we continue to take a look again, I do\nthank you for inviting me back here in\n\n13\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.030\nthe OfficePro.TV studios as we take\na look at now jumping into Access.\n\n14\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.070\nAnd of course,\n\n15\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.620\nusing some of the tools that are designed\nto help us to get reports done, okay?\n\n16\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.640\nNow when we start to use these particular\nutilities that they've already set up for\n\n17\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.990\nus, do not expect this to be\nwhat you think is going to be.\n\n18\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.690\nOkay, and what I mean by that is,\neverybody has this idea that, yeah,\n\n19\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.877\nthere is a simple tool,\nit should give us exactly what we want.\n\n20\n00:01:14.877 --> 00:01:17.669\nAnd it will give you\nfunctionally what you want but\n\n21\n00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:20.470\nit may not give you everything\nthat you want to do.\n\n22\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.390\nI want to make sure that you understand\nthat those tools are available to you if\n\n23\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.261\nyou only need pure functionality and\n\n24\n00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:30.890\nnot really necessarily anything about\nformatting, well, you can do this, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.278\nBut by doing that,\nyou're accepting the defaults,\n\n26\n00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:35.837\nyou're accepting whatever it\nis that Access shows you.\n\n27\n00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:37.870\nAnd that's pretty much what you have.\n\n28\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.310\nThe ability to go in and modify and\nto redo everything that you need to, it\n\n29\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.590\npretty much has been required you to kind\nof start all over, at least have a good\n\n30\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.400\nsolid understanding of what is working\nin the background for this to work.\n\n31\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.600\nSo let's just start creating some of\nthe different reports that we can do here.\n\n32\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.134\nSo let's show you where we do this.\n\n33\n00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:04.719\nNow here it is, I have opened up\nthe actual database here that we're using,\n\n34\n00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.600\nwhich is of course the forms database,\n\n35\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.020\nwhich we continued on from\na previous episode here.\n\n36\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.218\nSo now that I've got that, and\nI don't have any reports ready to go,\n\n37\n00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.384\nthat means we're ready\nto create something.\n\n38\n00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:21.273\n&gt;&gt; Just a quick little side note,\nif you're looking in the episode files,\n\n39\n00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:22.876\nit might say forms finished.\n\n40\n00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:23.401\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n41\n00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.243\n&gt;&gt; But this is just kinda continue on,\nbut we're at the same place.\n\n42\n00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:28.554\nSo just a little side note,\n\n43\n00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:32.601\nif you're like that's not the file that we\nhave, or it's a little bit different cuz\n\n44\n00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.270\nwe did like a save state-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n45\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.886\nAt the end of our forms, and\n\n46\n00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:39.550\nthen we moved on to using that\nsame file in the reporting desk.\n\n47\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.640\nSo it's slightly different,\nslightly not the same.\n\n48\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, anyway,\n\n49\n00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:48.966\njust throwing it out there for you if you-\n&gt;&gt; I did forget about that, Vonne.\n\n50\n00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:51.039\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My fault in taking a look at.\n\n51\n00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:55.562\nBut now we've actually got to this\npoint in our, with access, right?\n\n52\n00:02:55.562 --> 00:02:59.274\nWe will create all those tables, all those\nqueries, and all these forms that we see.\n\n53\n00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:03.819\nif l scroll down toward the bottom here,\nwe are missing, well, reports.\n\n54\n00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.609\nOkay so, we don't have any reports and\nthat means it's now time for\n\n55\n00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.481\nus just start generating\nsome different reports.\n\n56\n00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.010\nWell, it's fairly simple,\n\n57\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.243\nwe'll kinda follow the same thing that\nwe've been doing, where we go to Create.\n\n58\n00:03:16.243 --> 00:03:21.242\nAnd now instead of templates or tables,\nexcuse me templates, that's actually\n\n59\n00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:26.760\nright here, Tables, Queries, and Forms,\nwe are now going into the Report side.\n\n60\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.610\nAnd when you take a look at this idea\nunderneath the Reports here, okay,\n\n61\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.500\nthere's a lot fewer tools.\n\n62\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.387\nNotice that, Vonne, by comparison.\n\n63\n00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:38.260\nLook at all the ones in Forms,\nright, there's a ton of these.\n\n64\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.550\nAnd even these dropdowns\nactually bring you more forms.\n\n65\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.640\nBut notice in Reports, it says Reports,\n\n66\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.420\nReport Design, Blank Report,\nReport Wizard and Labels.\n\n67\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.400\nSo, it doesn't seem like a lot.\n\n68\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.455\nBut we're gonna see that that's\nnot really the challenging part,\n\n69\n00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:54.390\ntt's the number of tools.\n\n70\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit looks the same I'm assuming,\n\n71\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.720\nbut it slightly the same concept.\n\n72\n00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.004\nIt's just like we have with the forms.\n\n73\n00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:05.780\nIt's gonna do pretty much the same\nthing as a report, as a form.\n\n74\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.770\nBut yeah,\nwe don't have all those different options.\n\n75\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.115\nAnd looks like we have some labels,\nI'm thinking like mail merges and\n\n76\n00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:12.142\nthings like that so.\n\n77\n00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:15.340\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you do have this ability\nif you have everything set up,\n\n78\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.677\nnow we didn't set up\nour database this way.\n\n79\n00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:20.737\nBut if you had a database where\nit was designed to do that, and\n\n80\n00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:24.697\nwe could use the employee's table because\nit does have all the information for\n\n81\n00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.100\na mail merge that we could do,\nit gives us this.\n\n82\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.722\nSo let's start off with that one since\nthat's kinda the one that I'm probably not\n\n83\n00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:32.203\ngonna go and create a ton of them.\n\n84\n00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:35.331\nBut notice it says show\nthe actual label wizard, and\n\n85\n00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:39.400\nthis is the only way you can\ngenerate this inside of Access.\n\n86\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.390\nThere's no other method,\n\n87\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.720\nyou can't manually create a report\nthat will give you the labels.\n\n88\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.790\nYou must use this tool if you're\ngonna create these labels.\n\n89\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.092\n&gt;&gt; And we're saying mail merge because I'm\ngoing back to like to Word, where I wanna\n\n90\n00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:56.705\nmake labels almost like sticky\nlabels that you would use for IDs.\n\n91\n00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.969\nThat that you want the first name,\nlast name, and the room number or\n\n92\n00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:59.736\nsomething like that.\n\n93\n00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.293\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n94\n00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:04.432\n&gt;&gt; And this would be a place where you\nwould have the data source if we're taking\n\n95\n00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:05.105\nmail merge is.\n\n96\n00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.830\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n97\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.200\n&gt;&gt; Even the first and the last name,\nthe store number, put them on,\n\n98\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.110\nAvery 5106 labels and\nthen you print them out.\n\n99\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.850\nOkay, yep, that's what it looks like.\n\n100\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n101\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.770\nit's strange if you've already\nworked in other Office products,\n\n102\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.150\nit probably looks\nidentical to what you see.\n\n103\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.110\nSo at this particular point, notice\nthat you can choose whatever label, and\n\n104\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.633\nthere's the Avery ones that\nVonne was talking about.\n\n105\n00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.063\nAs well as some of the other products\nthat are available out there.\n\n106\n00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:38.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can see down there where\nit says filter by manufacturer cuz we're\n\n107\n00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.440\nnot here proposing that you-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n108\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.160\n&gt;&gt; Use Avery labels.\n\n109\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.713\nYou can use any type of labels.\n\n110\n00:05:42.713 --> 00:05:46.682\nBut they always have, when you buy\nit at whatever store, it's this and\n\n111\n00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:51.130\nthe number and then it matches up with\nthe dimensions of that particular thing.\n\n112\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.641\nMaybe file labels-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n113\n00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:55.300\n&gt;&gt; That you can put on file folder so.\n\n114\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.535\nAll sorts of different ones and\nyou can just pick that.\n\n115\n00:05:57.535 --> 00:06:02.035\nAssuming choose a table, choose a field,\nor arrange them just like you\n\n116\n00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:06.922\nwould in a mail merge, it is a mail merge\nthere's no reason for quotes there.\n\n117\n00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:08.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true.\n\n118\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.626\n&gt;&gt; It's a mail merge in word.\n\n119\n00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:11.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n120\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.530\nhere all you do is you choose whatever\nlabel size that you want If you actually\n\n121\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.050\ndo have different units of measure\nthat you want to, English or Metric.\n\n122\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.240\nWhether you have\na sheet-fed type of label,\n\n123\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.780\nwhich most of us don't anymore, actually,\nthat's probably the one, sorry.\n\n124\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.900\nWe do have sheet-fed, continuous is\nthe one that most of us don't do any more.\n\n125\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.890\nThat's requires that dot matrix\nparameter with the holes on the sides-\n\n126\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.672\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, yes.\n\n127\n00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Stuff like that.\n\n128\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.750\n&gt;&gt; You had to line them\nup with the little spooky\n\n129\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.470\nthings-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n130\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.775\n&gt;&gt; And get all, wow, blast from the past.\n\n131\n00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n132\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.900\nSo when you start to see this,\nit walks through pretty much the same way.\n\n133\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.120\nYou choose your font and you're size.\n\n134\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.073\nHopefully, I don't even\nknow which one I chose.\n\n135\n00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:56.350\nI chose this one, 2x2 and three quarters,\nI just chose it randomly here.\n\n136\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.350\nThen you choose how you\nwant the text to appear.\n\n137\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.300\nFrom that point,\nthis is where you can add in information.\n\n138\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.700\nSo I can select first name and\nlast name, and\n\n139\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.790\nthen I have to press Enter I believe, yep.\n\n140\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, can I stop you for a second?\n\n141\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.940\nWhen did we choose what table,\ndid I miss that?\n\n142\n00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.450\nOr was that just me?\n\n143\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Nope, it automatically\nlooked at all of our table,\n\n144\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.960\nand then it said, here's the only one that\nseems to fit with address and city and\n\n145\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.990\nstuff, so it automatically knew.\n\n146\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.550\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n147\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.250\nbecause it actually says, what would\nyou like on your mailing labels?\n\n148\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.360\nSo it actually did automatically\n\n149\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.420\nsay this is the only table that\nyou even meet this format.\n\n150\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.759\nSo when it found those fields like first,\nlast, address, city, state,\n\n151\n00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.523\nit automatically chose it for you.\n\n152\n00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:46.628\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so this isn't like you can\nwilly-nilly pick any of your tables and\n\n153\n00:07:46.628 --> 00:07:51.565\nfield combinations for labels cuz\nyou wanted to put loyalty number and\n\n154\n00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:54.506\nthe persons name or something like that.\n\n155\n00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.073\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not picking that,\n\n156\n00:07:56.073 --> 00:08:01.058\nit's mailing labels, if it's addressed or\nif its And the field has the heading in\n\n157\n00:08:01.058 --> 00:08:05.487\nwhat it looks like it thinks it's mailing,\nthat's all it's gonna do.\n\n158\n00:08:05.487 --> 00:08:07.443\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's pretty much about it.\n\n159\n00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:11.121\nI've messed up City, so I forgot City.\n\n160\n00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:15.941\nSo let me put City directly in there,\nand then I can even type in a comma and\n\n161\n00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:18.190\na space as you take a look.\n\n162\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.471\nTo be able to add that in and\nI can click Next from here.\n\n163\n00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:25.050\nNow, it's gonna ask me what\nfields I want to sort by.\n\n164\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.981\nWell this is important, right?\n\n165\n00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:29.831\nIf you're actually doing this for,\ncuz again it's been so\n\n166\n00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:32.221\nlong since I've done this, right?\n\n167\n00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:35.824\nIf you're doing this for\nthe presorted stuff, where you do it,\n\n168\n00:08:35.824 --> 00:08:37.237\nyou can do it by zip code.\n\n169\n00:08:37.237 --> 00:08:40.410\nYou can do all that stuff and\nmake sure it's presorted.\n\n170\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.386\nAnd then I did that for one summer,\nI never wanna do it again.\n\n171\n00:08:43.386 --> 00:08:45.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:08:45.228 --> 00:08:46.221\n&gt;&gt; A little bit about this because my\n\n173\n00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:47.197\nhusband works-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:47.197 --> 00:08:50.297\n&gt;&gt; In a print shop that does mails-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n175\n00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:52.393\n&gt;&gt; Bulk mailing, and there's all sorts\nof different ways that you can do.\n\n176\n00:08:52.393 --> 00:08:54.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How you organize the mail,\n\n177\n00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.721\nbring it to the mail room, to the post\noffice and you can get discounted rates.\n\n178\n00:08:58.721 --> 00:08:59.402\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n179\n00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:00.857\n&gt;&gt; But there are very strict standards.\n\n180\n00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:03.989\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so yeah,\nif you had to learn all of them,\n\n181\n00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:07.058\nI I only had to kind of do this by one or\ntwo things.\n\n182\n00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:09.742\nAnd it was enough, cuz there were\nlike 19 or 20 different zips and\n\n183\n00:09:09.742 --> 00:09:11.144\nI didn't wanna do that ever again.\n\n184\n00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:14.644\n&gt;&gt; Well I also help them lay\nout like a how to guide-\n\n185\n00:09:14.644 --> 00:09:15.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:18.713\n&gt;&gt; For their employees and for\ntheir customers, and so I did all of that.\n\n187\n00:09:18.713 --> 00:09:19.221\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n188\n00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:20.876\n&gt;&gt; So I know a lot about first-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:22.616\n&gt;&gt; Class mail and presort standard and\n\n190\n00:09:22.616 --> 00:09:24.650\nreturn address, all that kind of stuff.\n\n191\n00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.609\nIt's really interesting.\n\n192\n00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:27.227\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:27.227 --> 00:09:29.346\nSee, for me, not so interesting-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:09:29.346 --> 00:09:30.238\n&gt;&gt; But overall,\n\n195\n00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:32.995\nI can see why people\nwould end up doing this.\n\n196\n00:09:32.995 --> 00:09:36.357\nSo for us,\nwe're actually creating this as a report.\n\n197\n00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:39.058\nOur prefix is gonna be rpt here.\n\n198\n00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:44.594\nNow, you probably wouldn't do this for\na mailing label, but we can MailingLabel.\n\n199\n00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:47.955\nAnd then it's gonna say hey, you sure\nyou wanna see what this looks like?\n\n200\n00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:52.206\nI click Finish, and there it is,\nthere are the individual labels.\n\n201\n00:09:52.206 --> 00:09:56.477\nI did just zoom out just a little bit too\nmuch, but you can see now, there they are.\n\n202\n00:09:56.477 --> 00:09:59.625\nThey're actually kind of put in\nplace the way they want them to, and\n\n203\n00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.398\nthose labels are exactly lined\nup the way that they should.\n\n204\n00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:03.198\nIt should work.\n\n205\n00:10:03.198 --> 00:10:04.585\n&gt;&gt; It looks like we don't have\na space between the first and\n\n206\n00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:05.304\nlast name though, Ronnie.\n\n207\n00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.162\n&gt;&gt; We don't, no.\n\n208\n00:10:06.162 --> 00:10:08.485\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, Ricky Bobby is all one word.\n\n209\n00:10:08.485 --> 00:10:09.361\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:09.861\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n211\n00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:12.510\nthat was me forgetting\nto put that space in.\n\n212\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.643\nBut you can go back in and\nyou can run through the field again, and\n\n213\n00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:17.339\nprobably change it if you need to.\n\n214\n00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:18.579\nAnd that's what we have right there.\n\n215\n00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Not to jump ahead-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n216\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.706\n&gt;&gt; But\ncan we go into the design view here?\n\n217\n00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.013\nJust like we did with our forms or\nanything we could right click on up,\n\n218\n00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:28.049\nthere you go, okay.\n\n219\n00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:28.656\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n220\n00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:31.722\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's where you could\ngo ahead and put in a space.\n\n221\n00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:32.608\nAnd it's looking like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:10:32.608 --> 00:10:36.935\n&gt;&gt; Using the ampersand for\nconcatenating these fields together.\n\n223\n00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:37.907\n&gt;&gt; Fancy word.\n\n224\n00:10:37.907 --> 00:10:38.590\n&gt;&gt; Look at me.\n\n225\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.283\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:10:40.283 --> 00:10:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n227\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.640\nVonne is absolutely trending that\nI need to put a space in here.\n\n228\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.604\nSo remember,\nif you do have to use something like this,\n\n229\n00:10:47.604 --> 00:10:50.204\nit will pretty much take you to pluses or\nspaces.\n\n230\n00:10:50.204 --> 00:10:51.292\nIt will do it, okay?\n\n231\n00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:54.737\nBut this one is using ampersand,\nif I need a space to show up,\n\n232\n00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:57.050\nI need to put the space inside of quotes.\n\n233\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.730\nAnd then another ampersand in there\njust like what we see down here.\n\n234\n00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.665\nNotice that it took my comma and\nput it also inside of quotes.\n\n235\n00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:08.260\nAnd here is an example of putting\nanother space inside of here too.\n\n236\n00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.635\n&gt;&gt; And cuz we've done this in Excel,\nif you've watched the Excel shows and\n\n237\n00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:12.308\neverything.\n\n238\n00:11:12.308 --> 00:11:16.367\nWhere we're talking about having to\nactually type out text, strings of text,\n\n239\n00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:18.376\nyou put them in quotes and everything.\n\n240\n00:11:18.376 --> 00:11:22.048\nSo if it is something that you're\nfamiliar with, that's great.\n\n241\n00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:26.410\nIf you come into design and you're like\nit might just be even like you know what?\n\n242\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.834\nWhy don't I just go through the wizard,\nin the sense-\n\n243\n00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:29.363\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n244\n00:11:29.363 --> 00:11:34.419\nThe label wizard, cuz I know that place\nbetter and then I can design it that way.\n\n245\n00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:35.008\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n246\n00:11:35.008 --> 00:11:37.043\nthat might be a safe bet to go with too,\nright?\n\n247\n00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:38.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI would just walk through the wizard\n\n248\n00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:39.235\nagain-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n249\n00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:41.411\n&gt;&gt; If it were me,\nbecause I'm just previewing it,\n\n250\n00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:42.959\nI haven't printed anything out.\n\n251\n00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:46.552\nOnce I do this and\nI click on View, there we go.\n\n252\n00:11:46.552 --> 00:11:48.141\nVonne's Ricky Bobby-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:49.377\n&gt;&gt; Is still there and\n\n254\n00:11:49.377 --> 00:11:52.846\nnow he has a space between his first and\nlast name.\n\n255\n00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:55.926\n&gt;&gt; Well we don't really know since\nhe actually has two first names for\n\n256\n00:11:55.926 --> 00:11:56.751\nhis entire name.\n\n257\n00:11:56.751 --> 00:12:00.000\nWhether he has a space there or\nnot between his frist and last name.\n\n258\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.935\n&gt;&gt; Well look at the second entry.\n\n259\n00:12:00.935 --> 00:12:02.177\n&gt;&gt; I know yeah,\nlook at that second entry who's that?\n\n260\n00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:02.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who's tha?\n\n261\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.704\n&gt;&gt; That guy is nuts.\n\n262\n00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:06.273\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't trust that guy at all.\n\n263\n00:12:06.273 --> 00:12:08.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there we go, okay?\n\n264\n00:12:08.104 --> 00:12:12.528\nSo making just a simple\ntype of report here.\n\n265\n00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:16.683\nNow as far as labels go, it can be done,\nif that's exactly what you need it.\n\n266\n00:12:16.683 --> 00:12:20.230\nSo as long as you have those fields\nthere it will actually work for you.\n\n267\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.200\nI'm just gonna Save that as one\nof the changes that we have.\n\n268\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.120\nAnd we'll make sure you know that you\ncan use that as an example, okay?\n\n269\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.400\nSo labels, important at times when\nyou actually do need them, but\n\n270\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.250\nlet's go ahead and\ncreate something else as far as report.\n\n271\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.236\nNow the other thing that we wanna do is,\nso now that we started with labels,\n\n272\n00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:42.610\nI'm gonna move to the one that\nmost of us might actually think.\n\n273\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.962\nThis has gotta be the one that saves us,\nwhich is the Report button.\n\n274\n00:12:45.962 --> 00:12:49.720\nCreate a basic report of the data\nin your current query or table,\n\n275\n00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.935\nto which you can add features\nsuch as groups or totals.\n\n276\n00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:54.783\nThat's exactly what you think,\n\n277\n00:12:54.783 --> 00:12:58.224\nit sounds like everything is gonna\nwork out the way we want to.\n\n278\n00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:04.286\nBut remember that the way it actually\nsounds like is going to be easy, right?\n\n279\n00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:06.736\nSo Vonne, as l take a look at this,\n\n280\n00:13:06.736 --> 00:13:11.059\nit says l can add features such\nas groups or totals into this.\n\n281\n00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:17.497\nl simply clicking this button and then we\nare ready to go, but before you do that.\n\n282\n00:13:17.497 --> 00:13:22.236\nIf you want to actually create a report,\nlet’s say based off of a table, okay?\n\n283\n00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:25.428\nOr a query,\nall you have to do is select it first.\n\n284\n00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:29.713\nSo I’m going to select\nthe tblEmployees for right now, and\n\n285\n00:13:29.713 --> 00:13:33.140\nonce I select that, I click on Report.\n\n286\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.311\nAnd look at how easy it was Vonne,\nfor me to go ahead and create this.\n\n287\n00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:40.288\nI'm gonna close out this field list for\nnow, and\n\n288\n00:13:40.288 --> 00:13:44.847\nnow you see it literally did\ncreate a very nice report for\n\n289\n00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:48.633\nme of every single field in that table,\nokay?\n\n290\n00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:53.222\nSo it does end up working,\nwe can see all of everything going on.\n\n291\n00:13:53.222 --> 00:13:56.226\nBut notice something strange\nabout the fields Vonne, okay?\n\n292\n00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:59.450\nSo you see, how all of them actually look?\n\n293\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.842\nNotice that they're about the same size.\n\n294\n00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:03.941\nSo even for Florida, right?\n\n295\n00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:06.180\nLook at how big that is, okay?\n\n296\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.240\nSo you can something like address\nactually needing to be that size, but\n\n297\n00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.790\nwhy does Florida need to be that size?\n\n298\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.270\nAnd notice it didn't actually spread out\nenough for email address to do this.\n\n299\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.360\nAnd Vonne, what do you think these\ndotted lines are about right here?\n\n300\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.672\nWhat's going on right here?\n\n301\n00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:23.144\n&gt;&gt; I know those, those are page breaks.\n\n302\n00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:24.473\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, page breaks.\n\n303\n00:14:24.473 --> 00:14:28.829\nSo this one is not gonna print out the way\nthat we think it's going to print out,\n\n304\n00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:31.082\nif we were trying to hand this thing out.\n\n305\n00:14:31.082 --> 00:14:37.593\nSo sounds good, sounds great, but\nwhat is it really doing for us?\n\n306\n00:14:37.593 --> 00:14:42.186\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that it's kind of like\nwhen you have something in Excel.\n\n307\n00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:45.072\nWhere I need to change the column width,\nand\n\n308\n00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:48.282\nif you maybe hover up there\nyou get the two lines.\n\n309\n00:14:48.282 --> 00:14:52.009\nAnd the line with the two arrows\nto change the columns maybe?\n\n310\n00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:54.375\n&gt;&gt; I see, well not in this view.\n\n311\n00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:55.046\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n312\n00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:57.902\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if we have something like\nwe saw in the forms show a little\n\n313\n00:14:57.902 --> 00:14:58.519\nbit earlier.\n\n314\n00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:01.831\nWe have a layout view and so\nwe did see this, and Vonne,\n\n315\n00:15:01.831 --> 00:15:04.370\nif you remember from the form show.\n\n316\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.590\nWe showed you where you can\nessentially see the Report view.\n\n317\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.403\nBut with the layout, I can actually now\nmanipulate those, maybe a little bit.\n\n318\n00:15:11.403 --> 00:15:12.073\nThere you go.\n\n319\n00:15:12.073 --> 00:15:15.103\nAnd now Vonne, I can adjust that.\n\n320\n00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:16.559\n&gt;&gt; We had to go into that hybrid mode.\n\n321\n00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:19.109\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we don't wanna go into pure design\n\n322\n00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:22.582\nand get the grids and everything,\nwe are going into the layout.\n\n323\n00:15:22.582 --> 00:15:26.281\nSo yeah, I can definitely see\nthe similarities between the forms and\n\n324\n00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:27.061\nthe reports.\n\n325\n00:15:27.061 --> 00:15:31.760\nIn the sense of the same buttons if you\nwanna say, in some of the same options.\n\n326\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.820\nObviously different reasons why we have\nforms and reports input versus output.\n\n327\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.747\nBut this is good.\n\n328\n00:15:38.747 --> 00:15:40.455\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; we could change that, and\n\n329\n00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:43.857\nthen also again,\nI don't know if I'm going too far ahead.\n\n330\n00:15:43.857 --> 00:15:47.863\nThe alternating colors with the rows\nis that an automatic feature?\n\n331\n00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:51.787\n&gt;&gt; It is by default,\nthey have that turned on for you.\n\n332\n00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:53.796\nSo that you can actually\nget that set up and see.\n\n333\n00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:56.887\nSo if I select,\nlet me make sure here, Under format,\n\n334\n00:15:56.887 --> 00:15:59.912\nyou'll see that this one\nactually kind of colored or\n\n335\n00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:04.210\nremoved out because I have to be in\ndesign view for me to change that.\n\n336\n00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.430\nBut I can actually change the alternate\ncolor rows if I want to, but\n\n337\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.490\nthis one is actually by default\nthe grayish versus the white that we have.\n\n338\n00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.290\n&gt;&gt; You know, I didn't even take\na look up there at the ribbon and\n\n339\n00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.400\nlook at the contextual tab because it does\nlook like we have page set up and format.\n\n340\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.940\nSo, there's some other, page setup wasn't\nin the forms, because well, it's an input,\n\n341\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.300\nthis is an output.\n\n342\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.900\nSo we can see, maybe putting it into\na landscape view might be a good way.\n\n343\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.400\nMaybe I'm going too far ahead of you.\n\n344\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.170\nI'm just getting excited\nabout formatting so.\n\n345\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.040\n&gt;&gt; So you're starting to see some\nof the other issues that we get.\n\n346\n00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.010\nNow, Vonne, remember what that\nbutton said though, okay?\n\n347\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.220\nThis is why it's important that\nwe pay attention right here.\n\n348\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.740\nSo the button, actually if I hover\nover this again, let me remind you.\n\n349\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.800\nIt says, to which you can add\nfeatures such as groups or totals.\n\n350\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.790\nNow this one is not really the idea of\ntotalling anything that I really need to\n\n351\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.290\ndo for the employees.\n\n352\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.380\nBut how do I actually add groups\nin here that make any sense?\n\n353\n00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.900\nWell I need to go to design view and\n\n354\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.670\nthen from that point I can\nselect group and sort, and\n\n355\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:13.730\nthen I have to kind of zoom out and it's\nhere that you have to add all that in.\n\n356\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.670\nNow when I say that,\n\n357\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.150\nright, the problem is at this point\nyou don't know exactly what that does.\n\n358\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.120\nIt sounds good but\nyou're not exactly sure what happens here.\n\n359\n00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.050\nSo let me select add a group just for\nan example.\n\n360\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.130\nAnd now I have to figure out what am\nI going to group by at this point.\n\n361\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.990\nSo what actually makes sense in this\nparticular table for me to group by.\n\n362\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.410\nWell sometimes you actually find out that\nthere's really nothing, maybe StoreID.\n\n363\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.240\nSo if I do that, let's see here, and\nVonne, it looks like that I'm close.\n\n364\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.440\nThere you go, okay?\n\n365\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.330\nSo now I can see where add it in StoreID\nand it created this separate group for\n\n366\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.350\nme, and now I can see all of\nthe employees inside of store 101,\n\n367\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.080\nactually have been grouped together, okay?\n\n368\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.640\nSo that does make a little bit more sense.\n\n369\n00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.240\nWhen you're doing this in layout view.\n\n370\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay so Ronnie this is just like,\nwell, just like it says like grouping.\n\n371\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.950\nIt's like I'm summarizing the employees\nby store, so it's a sort.\n\n372\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.470\nBut I guess we can go another level\nwith the sort of taking now by store,\n\n373\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:21.240\nby last name and\nthen how do I want to summarize this data.\n\n374\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.480\nAnd this is also kind of cooking for\nme again.\n\n375\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.640\nI'm having another\nlightbulb moment of like,\n\n376\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.110\nbecause I always wanted to\nkeep doing this in the tables.\n\n377\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n378\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.943\n&gt;&gt; Because I was still\nthinking like Excel,\n\n379\n00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:34.496\nlike this is where we wanna go ahead and\ndo like the [CROSSTALK].\n\n380\n00:18:34.496 --> 00:18:35.630\n&gt;&gt; Information and everything.\n\n381\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.440\n&gt;&gt; But the output of the reports.\n\n382\n00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.680\nThat's where you really want\nto start organizing your data.\n\n383\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And this could be why,\n\n384\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.900\ncuz maybe the data wasn't inputed, or\nit's not stored in the table, in that way.\n\n385\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.010\nThis is where you do it,\nit's in the reports.\n\n386\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that should make sense.\n\n387\n00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.730\nBecause let's say that we have multiple\npeople actually doing data entry over\n\n388\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.100\na period of time.\n\n389\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.980\nWe don't know the order in which\nthey're actually going to be\n\n390\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.550\ndoing those particular\nentries of that data.\n\n391\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.000\nSo inside of the tables,\nthe data can actually be displayed\n\n392\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.640\nin whatever it chooses to be displayed in,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n393\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.970\nSo when we create a report, that's when\nwe can do that grouping that we need to,\n\n394\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.250\nand that's when we can\nactually do the sorting,\n\n395\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.240\nlike what Vonne is talking about,\nby what we need.\n\n396\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.490\nNow, Vonne, this works perfectly, and\n\n397\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.470\nlooks great when we're in\nthis layout view, okay?\n\n398\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.380\nSo, Vonne, when you take a look at this,\nit makes sense, doesn't it?\n\n399\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That we did that.\n\n400\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.600\n&gt;&gt; But what happens if I show you\nsomething else, such as the design view?\n\n401\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.180\nDoes that now make any sense to\nyou as you start to see this?\n\n402\n00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.963\n&gt;&gt; I'm a little lost,\nhonestly, there, Ronnie.\n\n403\n00:19:40.963 --> 00:19:42.016\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I mean,\n\n404\n00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:44.650\nokay so\nwe're gonna get to the design view.\n\n405\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.210\nSo this is something in which you\nhave to kind of pay attention to just\n\n406\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.170\na little bit.\n\n407\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.450\n&gt;&gt; Some that will work in\ncertain views and looks great.\n\n408\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.230\nSome that though,\n\n409\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.450\nespecially when using these tools,\nis not going to actually give you exact.\n\n410\n00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.470\nAnd then when you try and\ngo into design view and manipulate,\n\n411\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.320\nand go, what's going on in background,\nyou're gonna see\n\n412\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.600\nthat if you're not familiar with that\nbackground, it's not gonna really help.\n\n413\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.380\nAnd we'll spend a little bit of time\nwhen we go into the report designer,\n\n414\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.450\nto help us out.\n\n415\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:15.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I can see why I might want to\ngo into that layout view first because it\n\n416\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.210\nis like a final format, in a sense,\nlike with the page layouts, and\n\n417\n00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.630\nit's got all the information.\n\n418\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.920\nLet me just go ahead and\nwork with it there.\n\n419\n00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.630\nBut we have the more fine-tuning that\ncan be available in the design view.\n\n420\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we'll see that when\nwe get to that bigger point.\n\n421\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.000\nAll right, so\n\n422\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.900\nthere's an example of what we can do\nby just using that report button.\n\n423\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.520\nI'm going to save the changes there.\n\n424\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.090\nAnd it's gonna ask me what I want.\n\n425\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:46.600\nAnd we'll just simply do rpt,\nemployees and click OK.\n\n426\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.820\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n427\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.720\nuse some of the other tools that\nare also available too okay?\n\n428\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.100\nNow the other one that we also see\nhere is underneath the report grouping\n\n429\n00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.890\nis gonna be blank report.\n\n430\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.020\nCreate a new blank report so\nthat you can insert fields and\n\n431\n00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.300\ncontrols, and design the report.\n\n432\n00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.840\nSounds exactly like what I hope to do,\n\n433\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.210\nexcept what the heck is\nreport design then about?\n\n434\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:12.870\nAnd that's what it does.\n\n435\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.360\nWell, let's click on\nthis blank report first.\n\n436\n00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.530\nAnd now, notice that this is exactly\nwhat it sounds like, so we've\n\n437\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.500\nessentially got the layout view turned\non here, inside of our report rather.\n\n438\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.790\nI have my field list over\non the left hand side, and\n\n439\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.010\nwhen we work with forms, we do know\nthat we can simply create this again.\n\n440\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.600\nSo this time I'm gonna choose customers.\n\n441\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.070\nAnd when I click and\n\n442\n00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:41.000\ndrag here,notice what happens Vonne,\nit doesn't give me an option.\n\n443\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.220\nIt just says, here's how I'm going\nto start putting stuff in, okay?\n\n444\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.890\nNotice I'm not dragging into\nany one particular location.\n\n445\n00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.310\nIt just says here's what's gonna happen,\nand it starts to put them in.\n\n446\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.540\nSo now it means you'd have to go back and\nactually manipulate and\n\n447\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.340\nchange it to make it\nthe way that you want to.\n\n448\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.790\nBut you're now actually filling\nup this report pretty quickly.\n\n449\n00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.380\nAnd this actually probably gonna be\na little bit more hassle in trying to\n\n450\n00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.710\nactually re-manipulate and change where\nthings are going to be to try and\n\n451\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.720\nget it all to fit the way\nthat you want to.\n\n452\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.960\n&gt;&gt; And that group sort and\ntotal down at the bottom.\n\n453\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.510\nIs that because we had\nleft that feature on or\n\n454\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.100\nis that something that automatically\nturns on when we did a blank report?\n\n455\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.080\nI didn't know if it was like a residual\nof the last thing we were on.\n\n456\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.880\n&gt;&gt; It might have been the residual\nsince I actually did leave that on.\n\n457\n00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.740\nSo if you actually do see this here and\nit's still on if I close it out,\n\n458\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.260\nthat's probably gonna be gone and\nthat's what you can see.\n\n459\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.450\n&gt;&gt; So in case you start a new\nblank report it's like,\n\n460\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.590\nwhy don't I have that group thing\nthat Ronnie had in his episode.\n\n461\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:50.870\nIt's on that design textual tab,\nand it's the group and sort.\n\n462\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:55.170\nKinda it's almost like a turn it on\nturn it off, like a toggle type thing.\n\n463\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it really is and\nI really can't, but\n\n464\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.680\nI'm, my assumption is, it's probably\nbecause I left it on because I was trying\n\n465\n00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.270\nto get through this particular\nview as well, okay?\n\n466\n00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:10.440\nSo this will allow you to get fields\nonto your report area that you want to,\n\n467\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.265\nbut notice you don't really have a lot of\ncontrol in terms of design at this point,\n\n468\n00:23:14.265 --> 00:23:15.585\nall right, okay?\n\n469\n00:23:15.585 --> 00:23:18.165\nSo let's go ahead and close this one out.\n\n470\n00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:20.745\n&gt;&gt; It's just automatically adding another\n\n471\n00:23:20.745 --> 00:23:25.170\ncolumn in that report based on\nthe order in which you click on things.\n\n472\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.355\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, that is definitely true.\n\n473\n00:23:27.355 --> 00:23:29.200\nAnd this one was customers.\n\n474\n00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.150\nI was trying to make sure\nthat I knew what I was doing.\n\n475\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.400\n&gt;&gt; And could you like easily move\naround those columns that way?\n\n476\n00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.000\n&gt;&gt; To a point.\n\n477\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So in this one yes and no, all right.\n\n478\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.020\nIf their all lined up and\ntheir following a particular grid so\n\n479\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.220\nlet me select back to the layout view.\n\n480\n00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.333\nCan I click this and\nput it in between, yes.\n\n481\n00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:54.369\nNotice how that actually leaves\nthat blank space there so\n\n482\n00:23:54.369 --> 00:23:57.170\nit's not exactly following\nthe way that we want to.\n\n483\n00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.162\nAnd notice it didn't get the label.\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n484\n00:23:58.162 --> 00:23:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n485\n00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.307\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is maybe one of those,\n\n486\n00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:05.190\ndon't necessarily move things around.\n\n487\n00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.550\nWe probably need to, I'm gonna say we\nneed to go into design view for that.\n\n488\n00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.200\nI'm jumping all around again, but\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fine.\n\n489\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.330\nSo at this point you've seen\nthe majority of the tools.\n\n490\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.820\nSo, the last two are pretty much the tools\nwe use throughout the entire series,\n\n491\n00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:25.170\nright which is gonna be the wizard as well\nas the idea here of the report designer.\n\n492\n00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.530\nSo let's take a look at the Wizard here\nand that's gonna be our particular tool\n\n493\n00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:35.950\nof choice at least for this demonstration\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n494\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.740\nSo if I select the report wizard,\nwhich right up here under the grouping for\n\n495\n00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.880\nreports, after I click on create,\nthen I can go to report wizard.\n\n496\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.990\nAnd this is exactly like it sounds.\n\n497\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:50.040\nWe can create from tables,\nor queries, okay?\n\n498\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.150\nNow both of them have their advantages.\n\n499\n00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.560\nI always like to create from queries,\nmyself.\n\n500\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.710\nAnd the reason why is I know\nthe information, I want to see.\n\n501\n00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.560\nAnd if I can go ahead and\n\n502\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.620\ncreate a select query that shows me\nthe information I wanna see, I'm not\n\n503\n00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.950\ndigging through the tables to try and\nfind the information that I want to see.\n\n504\n00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.970\nBecause I've already done it, okay?\n\n505\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.640\nI've already selected those tables, and\n\n506\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.410\nI can simply just pull from\nthe queries if I wanted to.\n\n507\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:20.275\n&gt;&gt; Well, I've been using the terminology\nof the question and the answer.\n\n508\n00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:22.150\n&gt;&gt; Hope they kind of match right together,\n\n509\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.930\nthe queries is the question that\nI want to ask of my information.\n\n510\n00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.280\nThe report would be the output,\nthe answer that I get and\n\n511\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.550\nto be able to show people and\ndisplay the information.\n\n512\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Yep so here it is so yeah,\nonce you actually figure that out and\n\n513\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.660\nyou can create it from a query.\n\n514\n00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Notice that I've done this and\nthis not, these are now fields,\n\n515\n00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.550\nright, available fields\nfrom two different tables.\n\n516\n00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.770\nOne from the employees table and\nof course,\n\n517\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.280\nsome of them from\nthe store's table as well.\n\n518\n00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.750\nIf I select all of those fields,\n\n519\n00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.200\nI can simple drag that over\nto the right hand side.\n\n520\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.032\nClick next here and when I do so,\nit can ask me how I want to view the data.\n\n521\n00:26:00.032 --> 00:26:04.850\nYou wanna view it by the store number,\nand then every employee in that store.\n\n522\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.590\nOr do we want to view the employee\nindividually along with that?\n\n523\n00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.480\nSo, it's saying, hey,\n\n524\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.140\ndo you want to just create a simple kind\nof tabular list of all these things.\n\n525\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.100\nOr do I wanna actually\nseparated out by the stores?\n\n526\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.300\nWell let's select this one, cuz that's\nkind of what we did earlier as well, and\n\n527\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.395\nthat will help us to compare.\n\n528\n00:26:21.395 --> 00:26:24.550\nSo this one will have store manager ID,\nand\n\n529\n00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.740\ncity listed up here, and then\nthe employee first and last down here.\n\n530\n00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.640\nI click next, now it's gonna ask\nif I want to group at any level.\n\n531\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.170\nWell I'm not gonna worry about grouping,\n\n532\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.850\ncuz it looks like it's already\ndone that for us a little bit.\n\n533\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.790\nSo I can click next here, and\nnow it's gonna ask if I want to sort.\n\n534\n00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.570\nSo this is where Vonne\nwas talking about this,\n\n535\n00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.990\nI want to sort by last name,\nI can select that.\n\n536\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.040\nI can continue to sort if I had more\nfields to do it, I wanna just select last\n\n537\n00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.870\nname, click Next, and this is where it\nbecomes a little bit more challenging.\n\n538\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.730\nOkay, they kind of give you this preview\nand show you what the step is about.\n\n539\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.460\nSo they, of course,\nhave the major title up here.\n\n540\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.360\nThey have this tabular form that you see.\n\n541\n00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.800\nAnd now they're showing you\nthe grouping levels here.\n\n542\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.650\nAnd then the individual details and\nhow they should appear here.\n\n543\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:16.400\nI select Block, notice it actually\ndoes it in this block format instead.\n\n544\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.290\nAnd then of course Outline, this is\nanother one that shows you here again,\n\n545\n00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.040\nis that major grouping,\nsecondary grouping, and\n\n546\n00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.720\nthen your details underneath\nthis if you want to.\n\n547\n00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.460\nI'll just leave it at\nthe stepped right now,\n\n548\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.630\ncuz that's kind of\nthe easiest one to help us.\n\n549\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.060\nAlso adjust the field width so\nthat they all fit on a page is also nice.\n\n550\n00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.900\nIf I wanted to, I'm gonna select landscape\nbecause that's probably easier for\n\n551\n00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.360\nus to see.\n\n552\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:39.950\nClick Next here.\n\n553\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:44.360\nAnd now it's gonna say, hey,\nwhat is the title that I wanna see here.\n\n554\n00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.614\nAnd let's say that this\nis gonna be RPT and\n\n555\n00:27:50.614 --> 00:27:56.450\nthis is gonna be employees by stores.\n\n556\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.030\nI think that's what I did.\n\n557\n00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.030\nI can't remember.\n\n558\n00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.910\nAnd now, let's see, what did I-?\n\n559\n00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.450\nThis actually was,\nI changed this, I forgot.\n\n560\n00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:14.080\nI'll leave this for the actual manager so\nI have changed this particular query,\n\n561\n00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.040\na little bit before I knew it.\n\n562\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.850\nSo this one should actually be the manager\nand, or the store and the manager.\n\n563\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.150\nSo notice right here, here's the one for\nGainesville, and the actual last name.\n\n564\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.130\nLast name of the actual manager.\n\n565\n00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.280\nI was like, why did I actually\nsee all of the other employees?\n\n566\n00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.710\nThat's because I had changed the query\na little bit earlier as I was take and\n\n567\n00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.160\nlook and playing around.\n\n568\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.950\nSo this is the only other\nthing that I did wrong.\n\n569\n00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.610\nThose are actually separated first and\nlast name and employee ID that\n\n570\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:48.410\nshould probably be a little bit further\nover one way or the other, okay?\n\n571\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.560\nNow this one if we go back into\nthe design view, that can be changed.\n\n572\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.610\nBut notice again, Vonne, this looks\na little bit more foreign to us,\n\n573\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.950\nas we start to take a look at\nthe information here, okay?\n\n574\n00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.510\nSo we'll actually get into working\nwith this thing a little bit more.\n\n575\n00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.150\nBut I don't want to actually\nget into it right now.\n\n576\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:13.340\nBecause it's gonna just confuse you if\nI try and do that and at the same time.\n\n577\n00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.809\nSo am so gonna just put that back\nout there as we start to see it.\n\n578\n00:29:16.809 --> 00:29:20.850\nSo they all have their particular\nreason why you choose to do this.\n\n579\n00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.630\nBut notice that every single one\nhad something that's lacking.\n\n580\n00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.780\nYou really wanna build something you need,\nit's gonna be using the report designer.\n\n581\n00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.030\n&gt;&gt; Well even when you're like, wait,\nthis isn't exactly what I wanted it to do.\n\n582\n00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.870\nAnd the nice thing with\nthe wizard is it was\n\n583\n00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:33.800\npretty-\n&gt;&gt; Easy.\n\n584\n00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the fast and the furious where\nit was like, okay it's pretty easy for\n\n585\n00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.760\nme to go back through the steps.\n\n586\n00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.040\nMaybe my query wasn't\nexactly what I wanted.\n\n587\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.860\nOkay let me just go ahead and cancel\nthis or close out of it and not save.\n\n588\n00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.780\nDouble check my information,\ncuz this really, again this is the output.\n\n589\n00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.730\nSo it's just gonna generate\nwhatever you put into it.\n\n590\n00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:57.550\nAnd you have all those options, so if it\ndoesn't work the first time, just stop and\n\n591\n00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.840\nrun through the wizard again.\n\n592\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.670\n&gt;&gt; Run through the wizard again and\nchoose one.\n\n593\n00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.420\nAnd because I remembered actually\nright before the show, or yeah, or\n\n594\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.530\nright before actually the previous show.\n\n595\n00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.960\nI was taking a look at this and said,\nI wanna query just by managers and\n\n596\n00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.210\nsee if I could do that.\n\n597\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.460\nAnd I forgot that I had saved\nit underneath the employees here\n\n598\n00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:15.970\non that query.\n\n599\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.910\nAnd that's why I didn't\ngenerate all the employees,\n\n600\n00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.740\nbut it's easy enough to actually be able\nto fix in the query if we wanted to.\n\n601\n00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.150\nBut this one will at least show\nyou that you can use all of those.\n\n602\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.010\nFor us to get to the point\nthat we want to,\n\n603\n00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.830\nwhich is to create that kind of report\nin the way that we need to see it.\n\n604\n00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.180\nWe're gonna have to use\nthe report designer.\n\n605\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:37.840\nAnd we are going to also\nhave to understand this\n\n606\n00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.930\nmuch better as we start to do this.\n\n607\n00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.240\nSo this is technically what is\ncalled a banded report writer.\n\n608\n00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.920\nI know that this sounds strange, but we'll\ntalk about it and will show you what that\n\n609\n00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.040\nactually means, how to get done\nthe things that we want to get done.\n\n610\n00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.470\nAnd this particular report, as far as\ncreating reports that you need and\n\n611\n00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.300\nthat will help you out as well.\n\n612\n00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.710\nBut Vonne for this one,\nI kinda ran out of time already.\n\n613\n00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.220\nThat means we actually do have to\ngo to at least another part here.\n\n614\n00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.340\nTo get it done.\n\n615\n00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.652\n&gt;&gt; You've given us another\ncliffhanger there Ronnie.\n\n616\n00:31:08.652 --> 00:31:09.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n617\n00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.245\n&gt;&gt; People are just on the edge of our\nseats, we are on the edge of our seats.\n\n618\n00:31:13.245 --> 00:31:15.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Waiting to see what's coming next but\n\n619\n00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.560\nI do like the idea of being able to\ncontrol us a little bit more and\n\n620\n00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.970\ngive us exactly what we need.\n\n621\n00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.610\nBut you've already shown me\na few things that I think\n\n622\n00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.460\nare pretty cool in the reporting part.\n\n623\n00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.970\nSo at least I know I'm on the right track.\n\n624\n00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So well then we'll come back for\n\n625\n00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.040\na little but we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n626\n00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.740\nSigning off for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host Vonne Smith.\n\n627\n00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n628\n00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.688\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n629\n00:31:38.688 -->
