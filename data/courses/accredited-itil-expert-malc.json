00:00:07.926\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:09.940\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.440\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.450\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.110\nVery excited to be your host for\nITIL, managing across the life cycle.\n\n9\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.738\nAnd we'll be diving into logistics,\n\n10\n00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:30.606\nsetup and expectations with\nour very own Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:31.524\nAnd he's right there.\n\n12\n00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yup happy to be here Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.689\nAs usual we're going to setup\nthis course by talking about\n\n14\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.990\nthe basic logistics of things.\n\n15\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.190\nWork to orient yourself\ntowards the class files,\n\n16\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.800\nwhat you expect from the exam,\nwhat do you expect out of the course?\n\n17\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.510\nAnd without further adieu,\nlet's just kind of dive in here.\n\n18\n00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.910\nThis is the Capstone course for\nall of the ITIL curriculum.\n\n19\n00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.490\nIt's the final stage, if you will, before\nyou get to the ITIL expert credential.\n\n20\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.934\nSo, the prerequisite before you can\ntake this exam and get credit for\n\n21\n00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.012\nthe exam are 17 credit hours.\n\n22\n00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:07.470\nWe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n23\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.560\nAnd you see,\nwe're moving up the Blooms taxonomy scale.\n\n24\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.520\nYou have to apply your knowledge a little\nbit more expertly as the phrase goes.\n\n25\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.060\nSo, when we did foundations,\nwe were at the lower end of this.\n\n26\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080\nWe need to remember things and\nbe able to understand some concepts.\n\n27\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.932\nThe intermediate level exams that you've\ntaken dealt with applying knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:34.350\nAnd making sure that you could analyze\na given situation based on a scenario.\n\n29\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.500\nWell, what we're doing here in the MALC\nexam is taking it a little bit higher and\n\n30\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.140\nlooking at synthesizing, if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.350\nEvaluating a situation and\ncreating new knowledge, if you will,\n\n32\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.850\napplying it effectively.\n\n33\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.139\nAnd primarily that's done\nthrough this case study.\n\n34\n00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.299\nNot just scenarios but\n\n35\n00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.220\na full blown case study where you get\nvery familiar with this organization.\n\n36\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.009\nIt's a financial services organization.\n\n37\n00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.910\nIt's a challenging exam but it's also\na rewarding exam in that once passed,\n\n38\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.760\nyou get a very special\ncredential called ITIL expert.\n\n39\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.170\n&gt;&gt; And everybody wants to be\nan ITIL expert I would think.\n\n40\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n41\n00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Who wants to get in ITIL of course.\n\n42\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah..\n\n43\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.003\n&gt;&gt; So as we've done with the intermediate\nlevel exams and courses.\n\n44\n00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.482\nThere certainly are gonna be\nmy presentation of theory and\n\n45\n00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:24.810\nlecture approach giving real\nworld examples to these concepts.\n\n46\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.690\nThe primary difference is\nwe approach marker however\n\n47\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.750\nis that we are not really\nbringing in new information.\n\n48\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.220\nIt's really just going to be how\nwe can synthesize this information\n\n49\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.350\ntowards some common goal.\n\n50\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.912\nSo a little bit less\nimportance is my lecture.\n\n51\n00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:43.910\nIt's gonna be a high expectation\nthat you're gonna be diving\n\n52\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.170\ninto the practice exams,\nthe mock tests if you will.\n\n53\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.070\nYou're gonna be doing some exercises\nin getting real familiar with this\n\n54\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.250\ncase study.\n\n55\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.970\nThe good news is, is this case study that\nwe use throughout this portion of the exam\n\n56\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.440\nprep, is the exact same case study\nyou'll get on the real exam.\n\n57\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.982\nSo, you can memorize this thing.\n\n58\n00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:08.550\nYou'll know this company inside out\nbefore you even go o take the exam.\n\n59\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.030\nAnd then of course, the scenarios based on\nthis case study, this company if you will,\n\n60\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.210\nthat tease out some more details that you\nhave to approach in the actual questions.\n\n61\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of good information for\n\n62\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.130\nyou to sink your teeth\ninto in this course.\n\n63\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.483\nAll this material is owned and\noperated by AXELOS,\n\n64\n00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:33.011\nthe ones that own the copyright material,\nit's called ITIL curriculum.\n\n65\n00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:37.424\nA brief history, as you know ITIL\nhas been around since the late 80's.\n\n66\n00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:40.326\nIt's gone through some\nupgrades over the years.\n\n67\n00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:42.861\nWe're at now at version three since 2011.\n\n68\n00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:48.110\nThe only significant update to\nthe ITIL material since 2011 has been\n\n69\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.371\nthe addition of the ITIL practitioner\ncourse that came out last spring.\n\n70\n00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:57.392\nAnd that course helps answer the question,\n\n71\n00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:03.380\nhow would I go about answering\nthe question about adopting ITIL.\n\n72\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.400\nYou remember the five\nstages of the life cycle?\n\n73\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400\nAgain, no new information here.\n\n74\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.170\nI'm going to be, certainly,\n\n75\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.140\ntouching on the life cycle stages, and\nhow they integrate with each other.\n\n76\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.470\nThose inner points of integration,\nmanaging across the life cycle\n\n77\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.520\nnecessarily means you're gonna be\nlooking at this at a 5,000-foot view.\n\n78\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.380\nHolistically, looking at an organizational\nchallenges from a strategic point of view.\n\n79\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.160\nSo it's not just service strategy.\n\n80\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.850\nIt's looking at IT service management\n\n81\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.000\nthrough the lens of Strategic\napplication and strategic analysis.\n\n82\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.960\nSo again, kinda challenging, but\n\n83\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.390\nalso quite rewarding cuz it gives\nyou that nice big view of ITIL.\n\n84\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.240\nSo, The Qualification Scheme.\n\n85\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.490\nAll these is all maintained\nin accredited status\n\n86\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.490\nfrom AXELOS on through\nthe exam institutes.\n\n87\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.555\nExam institutes then accredit\ntraining organization,\n\n88\n00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:08.295\nI'm here representing PassionIT Group,\nan accredited training organization.\n\n89\n00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:11.115\nThey go through the rigors\nof designing the curriculum\n\n90\n00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:14.895\naccording to the syllabus as\npublished by the exam institutes.\n\n91\n00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:19.175\nThey are audited for compliance with\nthat syllabus and also audited for\n\n92\n00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.505\ncompliance in delivery.\n\n93\n00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:25.350\nSo that gives the PassionIT\ngroup the accreditation\n\n94\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.665\nto send me as an accredited trainer\nto deliver this for ITProTV.\n\n95\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.140\nObviously, all this is works together\nto mean that there's quality control\n\n96\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.510\nthroughout the system through the exams,\n\n97\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.679\nthrough the curriculum development,\nmapping back to a specific syllabus.\n\n98\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n99\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n100\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.675\nNow, it kinda looks like a house here,\nthe house that ITIL built.\n\n101\n00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:52.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you have a look near the bottom of\n\n102\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.110\nthis, you've got Foundation, of course.\n\n103\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.300\nThat's where you would expect\nto see the foundation.\n\n104\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.500\nIt's the bottom of the house.\n\n105\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.620\nThat is a prerequisite.\n\n106\n00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.170\nYou must have foundation.\n\n107\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.840\nAs one of your sets of credits.\n\n108\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.940\nYou get two credits for that.\n\n109\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.890\nYou'll see ITIL Practitioner\ncan get you three credits.\n\n110\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.950\nAs you go up through these courses,\nyou get different degrees of credits.\n\n111\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.720\nSo on the Capability Module side here,\nyou'll see Service Offerings and\n\n112\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.300\nAgreements, Release, Control and\nValidation, Planning, Protection and\n\n113\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.910\nOptimization, Operational Support and\nAnalysis.\n\n114\n00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.790\nThose Capability Modules\ngive you four credits each.\n\n115\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.850\nAll available on ITProTV, by the way.\n\n116\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we have the sample\npaper reviews as well that we did.\n\n117\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n118\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.620\nSo again,\nit's expectation before you take mount\n\n119\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.850\nyou've collected 17 credits.\n\n120\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.450\nHowever you get those credits two\nof them must be foundation, and\n\n121\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.190\nthen you just gotta go get 15 more.\n\n122\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.010\nDo you take these four capability ones,\nwhich is 16 a little overkill?\n\n123\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.470\nDo you take five life cycle ones,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.480\n&gt;&gt; To get those?\n\n125\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.980\nWhen you have a total of 17,\nYou are eligible to take the MALC exam.\n\n126\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.520\nAnd with the MALC exam,\nsuccessful passing the MALC exam,\n\n127\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.430\ngives you five credits, that totals 22.\n\n128\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.240\nThose 22 credits get you that magic\ncredential called ITIL expert.\n\n129\n00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.320\nTo be an accredited trainer you\nmust hold the expert credential.\n\n130\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.430\nSo, if you're in an accredited training\nclass you know that your instructor has\n\n131\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.760\ngone through the accredited\ntraining up to the expert level.\n\n132\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.710\nNow, in my particular case I've\nhappened to take both sides of these.\n\n133\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.470\nI've taken all the lifecycle ones.\n\n134\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.780\nI've taken all the capability ones.\n\n135\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.680\nI've also had practitioner and foundation.\n\n136\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.310\nAnd I bring that knowledge\nto the lecture for MALC.\n\n137\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.580\nYou need to do that too.\n\n138\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.280\nYou've gone on some path, to get here.\n\n139\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.350\nMaybe you've taken life cycle modules.\n\n140\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.070\nMaybe you've taken some\ncapability modules.\n\n141\n00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.240\nMaybe you've mixed and matched them,\nwhich is totally fine.\n\n142\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.950\nBut you're gonna be bringing\nthat knowledge to this course.\n\n143\n00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.244\nAnd more importantly,\n\n144\n00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.620\nholistically bringing that same\nknowledge to the MALC exam.\n\n145\n00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.482\nAs I mentioned before MALC\nbrings no new information.\n\n146\n00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:09.260\nIt's gonna be the trick of the trade\nhere is going to be how we use this\n\n147\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.730\ninformation in some sort of synthesis,\ncreating knowledge,\n\n148\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.280\ncreating application for this knowledge.\n\n149\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.519\nSo just a little bit step further.\n\n150\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.530\nHere they are again played out.\n\n151\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.920\nThe ITIL foundations through\nthe life cycle modules.\n\n152\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.140\nOne of the differences between the life\ncycle modules and the capability modules\n\n153\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.390\nis the life cycle modules are one to one\nrelationship to the core publications.\n\n154\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.300\nWhat I mean by that is there's\na course called service strategy.\n\n155\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.860\nThere's a core publication\ncalled service strategy.\n\n156\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.410\nThere's a course called\nservice transition.\n\n157\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.940\nThere's a book called service transition.\n\n158\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.670\nSo one to one relationship there.\n\n159\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.780\nThe capability modules are based\non a blend of the core books.\n\n160\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.547\nAs an example, service offering agreements\ntakes some from service strategy and\n\n161\n00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:00.146\nsome from service design.\n\n162\n00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:04.200\nAnd mixes them into a practical approach.\n\n163\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.630\nSo, it's more like doing.\n\n164\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.730\nYou get a bit more credit for\nthose as well.\n\n165\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.590\nAnd a little bit deeper dive\ninto the activities involved\n\n166\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.839\nin those specific processes\nthat are being discussed.\n\n167\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.340\nMALC again takes that a step further.\n\n168\n00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.180\nSo, if you're taking a Service Strategy\nExam, or you're taking a Service Offerings\n\n169\n00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.690\nand Agreement Exam,\nyou kinda know the boundaries of the exam.\n\n170\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.600\nIt's just that subject\nmatter you just took.\n\n171\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.130\nMALC is gonna be a bit more challenging\nin that the subject matter is\n\n172\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.470\nall five books all the time.\n\n173\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.060\nAnd how they blend together and how\nthey're distinguishing from each other.\n\n174\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.695\nSo that makes MALC challenging but,\nagain, it also makes it rewarding.\n\n175\n00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:46.430\nBecause you're getting to this practical\nsense of strategically looking\n\n176\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.120\nat ITIL as a strategic asset.\n\n177\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.700\nAnd that's really what we're\ntrying to position MALC for.\n\n178\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.200\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n179\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.341\n&gt;&gt; So\nthe exam itself is virtually the same as\n\n180\n00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:59.384\nthe intermediates you've already taken.\n\n181\n00:09:59.384 --> 00:10:01.940\nExcept there's ten questions and\nnot eight.\n\n182\n00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.680\nAnd one big difference is\nthere's this case study.\n\n183\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.150\nIt's about seven pages long.\n\n184\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.380\nAnd that case study forms the basis for\neight of the ten questions.\n\n185\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.420\nAs many as two of the questions can be\naway from the topic of the case study.\n\n186\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.480\nSo you get eight questions\nassociated with the case study.\n\n187\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.440\nEach question has it's own separate\nscenario in between the case study and\n\n188\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.400\nthe question if you will.\n\n189\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.095\nSo there's that extra\nlayer of Information.\n\n190\n00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:33.045\nCertainly the latter episodes when we\nstart approaching exam preparation.\n\n191\n00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:38.595\nThe latter episodes in this series are\ngonna deal with an approach to taking and\n\n192\n00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:40.245\nmastering this exam technique.\n\n193\n00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:43.155\nWhere you have a case study and\nyou have the scenario.\n\n194\n00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:45.185\nSo we'll get to that in due time.\n\n195\n00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:48.875\nYou get two hours to take the exam.\n\n196\n00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:54.100\nSo ten questions, 120 minutes,\nthat's about 12 minutes per question.\n\n197\n00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.030\nYou don't wanna be learning the case study\nfor the first time when you set this exam.\n\n198\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.870\nThis case study needs to be something\nyou know very well already.\n\n199\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.790\nAnd again, the good news is the same\ncase study that's used in this course\n\n200\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.400\nis the very same case study\nyou'll get on the exam.\n\n201\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.320\nSo there's really no excuse for not\nknowing that case study inside and out.\n\n202\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.780\nKnow it well.\n\n203\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.680\nTherefore, you won't be\nparsing it while you're\n\n204\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.910\nmanaging your time on the real exam.\n\n205\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.690\nVery important there.\n\n206\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.350\nYou still gotta get a 70%.\n\n207\n00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.053\nThat's 35 out of 50, so if you do the math\nhere, again, you gotta get 70%, that's 35.\n\n208\n00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:31.650\nThere's ten questions.\n\n209\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.490\nIf you get six three-point answers,\nthat's 18.\n\n210\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.750\nAnd you got four more to go.\n\n211\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.840\nSo you can get 20 out of that,\nthat's 38, all right.\n\n212\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.400\nSo maybe you can have seven three point\nanswers to get 21 points with three to go,\n\n213\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.530\ngives you the 15.\n\n214\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.930\nKind of do the math there.\n\n215\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.910\nSo perfection is not required,\n70% obviously is not 100%.\n\n216\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.040\nBut if you were to get a zero answer or\n\n217\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.170\na one answer then you're\nmargin of error is shrinking.\n\n218\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.080\nYou gonna have to go find some extra\nfive point answers along the way.\n\n219\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.740\nSo as you approach the exam,\na great approach is to get really good and\n\n220\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.180\neliminating the ones and the zeroes.\n\n221\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.980\nSo that you're always in this little\nwheelhouse of choosing between\n\n222\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.460\nthe best answer and the next best answer.\n\n223\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.670\nIf you're here,\n\n224\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.810\nit's because you've already had some\nsuccess on intermediate level exams.\n\n225\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.830\nSo you know how that row is hoed.\n\n226\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.860\nSo get your hoe out\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.940\n&gt;&gt; And work a little harder.\n\n228\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.738\n&gt;&gt; And I'm from Iowa, and\nbelieve me, you need to be hoeing.\n\n229\n00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:33.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n230\n00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.930\nSo that's kinda the lay of the land.\n\n231\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.710\nThat's the lay of the land,\nwhat you expect.\n\n232\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.720\nOne other big thing is,\nyou're own self study is important.\n\n233\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.420\nYou'll see episode files up above,\nthere's some up above right now.\n\n234\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.774\nAs you look at your episode files,\nyou can download the sample papers.\n\n235\n00:12:46.774 --> 00:12:51.120\nThere are process charts and\nvarious things that can help you study.\n\n236\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.730\nAnd also help you have in front of you\nwhile you're watching these lectures.\n\n237\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.980\nIt's a good visual reference,\nincluding the course handbook.\n\n238\n00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.060\nWhich has the same PowerPoint\nas going through here.\n\n239\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.960\nYou can take notes and whatnot.\n\n240\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.392\nSo I highly encourage you to\ndownload those materials.\n\n241\n00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:09.405\nAnd as you get into each episode,\nyou'll find additional materials for\n\n242\n00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:11.570\nknowledge checks and exercises.\n\n243\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.100\nI highly encourage you to go there.\n\n244\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.144\nAnd as we go through the episodes,\nI'll remind you that they're there and\n\n245\n00:13:16.144 --> 00:13:17.316\nwhat the value of those are.\n\n246\n00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:21.320\nAnd I look forward to seeing you for\nfuture episodes here.\n\n247\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Terry.\n\n248\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.760\nAnd we're gonna be diving really into this\nMALC so, and fortunately its on video.\n\n249\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.610\nYou can watch it again and\nagain and again.\n\n250\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.550\nSo again, thanks again Terry.\n\n251\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be.\n\n252\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.080\n&gt;&gt; And thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n253\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.040\nYou know a good IT Pro is always learning.\n\n254\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.940\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n255\n00:13:37.940 -->

00:00:05.188\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:07.952\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:10.672\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:15.630\n&gt;&gt; Well hello there thank you again for\nchoosing IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.670\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nwe are continuing on with ITIL Malk.\n\n9\n00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.720\nLots of episodes in this series\nyou want to watch them all,\n\n10\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.470\nbringing us to the information\nwe need is Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.430\n&gt;&gt; Hello, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.950\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Terry.\n\n13\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.580\n&gt;&gt; Yep, doing good.\n\n14\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n15\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.300\nAs Zach said, we're gonna move in\nto a foundation refresher here for\n\n16\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.430\na manager across the life cycle.\n\n17\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.670\nThis particular episode concerns\nthe concepts, and just basically\n\n18\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.180\nthe vocabulary of ITIL is part of every\nintermediate course that we offer.\n\n19\n00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.960\nSo if it looks and sounds familiar,\nit's because it's pretty much identical.\n\n20\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.110\nAt this point, you've gone through more\nthan one intermediate level course so\n\n21\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.260\nI'm going to be a little\nbit quicker about this.\n\n22\n00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.830\nDon't let my speed belay\nthe importance of this.\n\n23\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.470\nYou need to know\nthe language of ITIL because\n\n24\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.440\nif no other reason that's the language\nthat's gonna be on the exam.\n\n25\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.640\nOne of the blessings of ITIL and one of\nthe banes of ITIL is it takes words and\n\n26\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.180\ngives them specific meaning.\n\n27\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.630\nAnd it's a blessing because we\nneed communicate consistently so\n\n28\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.100\nby having a common vocabulary we\ncan more effectively communicate.\n\n29\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.630\nRight?\n\n30\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.640\nI guess the bane part of it is that\nthey've taken words that already\n\n31\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.830\nhave meaning.\n\n32\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.520\nThey take words that we're already using\nin our common life, daily life, and\n\n33\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.450\nour work life.\n\n34\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.820\nAnd they've given them\ntheir specific meanings.\n\n35\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820\nSo, we have to retranslate, or\nrelearn some of the things.\n\n36\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.360\nAgain, the blessing and the bane,\nlet's dive in and enjoy them both.\n\n37\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.656\nFirst of all, the life cycle.\n\n38\n00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:41.930\nAs you recall,\n\n39\n00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.170\nITIL divides a service across its\nlife cycle into five stages, right?\n\n40\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.330\nSo a life cycle meaning\nfrom birth to death, from\n\n41\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.965\nthe day you're hired to the day you're\nfired, whatever the life cycle might be.\n\n42\n00:01:55.965 --> 00:02:00.495\nThey divide it into five stages strategy,\ndesign, transition, operations and\n\n43\n00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.265\nCSI right.\n\n44\n00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:06.235\nYou have a chart available for\ndownloaded in episode files\n\n45\n00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:10.590\nthat shows you all these stages with\nall the processes underneath them.\n\n46\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.110\nI find it very helpful to have that as\na regular touchstone as we're learning\n\n47\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.310\ndifferent topics to put the discussion\nin the context of the lifecycle,\n\n48\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.750\nhaving that nice visual in front\nof you is very helpful, right,\n\n49\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.280\nso I encourage you to have that.\n\n50\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.640\nDownload available, or\nif you've printed it, even better, and\n\n51\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.070\nhave it at your desktop.\n\n52\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.910\nSo as we talk about these\ndifferent processes,\n\n53\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.540\nwe see it in the context\nof the entire life cycle.\n\n54\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.860\nA big part of MALK is going to\nbe understanding the interaction\n\n55\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.430\nof these various stages.\n\n56\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.420\nWhich necessarily means the interaction\namong the processes within the stages.\n\n57\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.660\nIf you're looking at a strategic view\nof an organization and you're analyzing\n\n58\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.170\nthe health of your IT service provision,\nright, your IT service management.\n\n59\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.250\nYou're necessarily gonna have\nto look across the lifecycle,\n\n60\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.400\nthus the name,\nmanaging across the lifecycle.\n\n61\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.700\nThere is a high component of strategic\nvalue To MALK or strategic scope right.\n\n62\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.650\nThat doesn't mean we're necessarily\nlooking at service strategy more so\n\n63\n00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.330\nthan service operations.\n\n64\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.500\nIt's we're looking at all these\nstages with a strategic view right.\n\n65\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.670\nSo as we continue on I mean,\ngood vocabulary here.\n\n66\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.230\nWhat is a service, the very central\n\n67\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.290\nconcept of service management of course is\na service and knowing what a service is.\n\n68\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.550\nThe textbook definition is,\nas you see there,\n\n69\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.450\na means of delivering value to customers\nby facilitating outcomes they want to\n\n70\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.980\nachieve without ownership Of cost and\nrisk.\n\n71\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.410\nIn other words, as a service provider,\nyou take the details of cost and\n\n72\n00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.000\nrisk away from the customer and\nprovide service to them.\n\n73\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.790\nWhen you go to a restaurant you\nwant it to be delivered on time,\n\n74\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.390\nyou want it to be delivered\nat the right temperature.\n\n75\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.630\nRight, of course you want\nit to taste good as well.\n\n76\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.560\nAre you monitoring how\nthey staff the kitchen,\n\n77\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.350\nor when they got their\nproduce order that morning?\n\n78\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.820\nAre you actually monitoring\nhow fresh the meat is, no?\n\n79\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.130\nYou're going to get the service,\n\n80\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.260\nyou're going to get the food\nserved at the appropriate times,\n\n81\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.150\nand the appropriate temperatures, and\nyou're going to taste it and say yep.\n\n82\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.500\nYou delivered service and\nI'm gonna pay you for that service.\n\n83\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.800\nSo the nature of service\ndelivery is understanding that\n\n84\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.850\nyou're gonna be delivering value to\nthat customer, and that they don't\n\n85\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.139\nhave to worry about all the details of\nwhat it takes to deliver that value.\n\n86\n00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.552\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; The golden concept of customer\n\n87\n00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:32.870\nservice value?\n\n88\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n89\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.800\nThey're all embodied right there.\n\n90\n00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.890\nThe three golden concepts, they will\nstill serve you on this exam as well.\n\n91\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.970\nUnderstanding that service is being\ndelivered, not just systems or solutions.\n\n92\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.530\nYou're delivering service to customers.\n\n93\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.760\nAnd you're delivering service so that\nthey can achieve some sort of outcome.\n\n94\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.760\nThrough that, they're gonna get value.\n\n95\n00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.490\nRight, so focus on the customer, deliver\nthem value and you do so through services.\n\n96\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.060\nThat's the golden triangular\nif you will elite them, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.480\nOkay so what is service management?\n\n98\n00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.510\nWell if a service is a means of\ndelivering value, service management is\n\n99\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.460\nkinda like a snake swallowing its own tail\ncuz it's kind of a circular reference.\n\n100\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.510\nService management is the ability\nto deliver value through services.\n\n101\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.390\nWhich is a means of\ndelivering value right.\n\n102\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.820\nSo it's kinda that's what I mean by\nthat little circular thing there.\n\n103\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.780\n&gt;&gt; Cyclical.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cyclical so\n\n104\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.540\nservice management is really your\ncapability to manage your services, right?\n\n105\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.210\nDeliver your value through services.\n\n106\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.010\nEither have a service management\ncapability, or you don't.\n\n107\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.750\nAnd strictest terms, ATIL,\n\n108\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.920\nbegins with understanding Service,\nright, and not just solutions.\n\n109\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.990\nSo service management is\nthat set of capabilities or\n\n110\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.640\ntools that you have available\nto make this successful, right.\n\n111\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.980\nITIL describes 26 processes.\n\n112\n00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.580\nThrough those 26 process you do them well,\n\n113\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.640\nchances are you'll be doing\nservice management well.\n\n114\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.650\nThat's basically the lay of the land if\nyou will, the service management, right?\n\n115\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.220\nSo at the heart of this is making sure you\nhave a good solid customer relationship.\n\n116\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.860\nA big part of service is understanding how\nyou're delivering value to the customers.\n\n117\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.330\nHow are you facilitating their outcomes,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.120\nThat's really what it boils down to.\n\n119\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.560\nIf you don't know your customer well,\n\n120\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.390\nchances are you're not gonna\nbe as successful, right?\n\n121\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.940\nIf you're just kinda guessing what they\nwant or throwing something on the wall and\n\n122\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.690\nhope it sticks, right?\n\n123\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.130\nRather than taking the approach of\nactually determining what the requirements\n\n124\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.920\nare, what their desired outcomes are,\nand matching your IT solutions and\n\n125\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.150\nservices to those outcomes that's the key,\nright?\n\n126\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.680\nThe three types of service providers\nagain review Type I is internal and\n\n127\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.000\nType II is also internal.\n\n128\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.530\nIt's just Type I is internal\nto the business unit and\n\n129\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.850\ntype two of shared services.\n\n130\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.960\nI worked for years in a shared services\npart of the organization where we\n\n131\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.900\nwere providing services that every\nbusiness unit consumed, like e-mail,\n\n132\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.460\nand internet portal, and learning\nmanagement, and document management.\n\n133\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.510\nThings that everyone consumed.\n\n134\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.754\nBut, I also worked in organization had\ninternal IT departments working for\n\n135\n00:07:15.754 --> 00:07:17.488\nthe specific business areas.\n\n136\n00:07:17.488 --> 00:07:23.128\nLike there was an RND IT department or\na manufacturing IT department and\n\n137\n00:07:23.128 --> 00:07:27.264\nthose IT providers service\nproviders they provided\n\n138\n00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:32.460\nthe detailed awareness of\nthe business In those cases right.\n\n139\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.715\nAnd then type 3 is an external service\nprovider where you provide services to\n\n140\n00:07:36.715 --> 00:07:39.537\ncustomers that are outside\nof your organization.\n\n141\n00:07:39.537 --> 00:07:42.080\nPerhaps for profit even right.\n\n142\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.618\nSo the nice thing about this particular\nscenario is type 1, type 2, type 3,\n\n143\n00:07:46.618 --> 00:07:50.688\nit' important to make these\ndistinguishing characteristics known,\n\n144\n00:07:50.688 --> 00:07:55.333\nright and then understand the differences\nbetween TYPE I, TYPE II and TYPE III.\n\n145\n00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:58.932\nBut in the end, these are really\ndistinctions without a difference.\n\n146\n00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:03.813\nAnd what I mean by that- Is that the\nprinicples of ITIL, delivering value to\n\n147\n00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:08.410\ncustomers applies equally to all three,\nType I, Type II and Type III.\n\n148\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.917\nNow your funding sources\nmight be different,\n\n149\n00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:12.950\nthe politics might be different.\n\n150\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.420\nI totally understand that, and\nthat's not trivial, that's important.\n\n151\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.930\nBut at the end of the day, the principles\nof ITIL apply equally to all three types.\n\n152\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.620\nAs you get to the MALC exam,\n\n153\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.640\nthe case study is an external provider,\nthey're a financial services.\n\n154\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.250\nI'm sorry,\nthey are a provider of financial services.\n\n155\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:37.440\nThey have some external components,\nsome customer use IT services, right?\n\n156\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.040\nThey also have internal customers,\nand they also have shared services.\n\n157\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.300\nSo all three are in play\neven on the MALC exam.\n\n158\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.350\nAnd yet\nwe're only talking about one organization.\n\n159\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.050\nAll right.\n\n160\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.380\nStakeholders, there are four\nstakeholder groups.\n\n161\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.100\nYou see in here, the service providers is,\na customer, a user and suppliers.\n\n162\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.440\nThe four primary stakeholder\ngroups are important.\n\n163\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.840\nIt's neat how ITIL takes and distills\nconcepts down into digestible bits.\n\n164\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.605\nHere, they're simply categorizing\nfour groups of stakeholders, and\n\n165\n00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:14.656\nthis is the only four you\nhave to worry about, right.\n\n166\n00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:17.470\nNow of course,\nthere's nuances among these stakeholders.\n\n167\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.770\nIf you're talking to executives at\nthe supplier organization as opposed\n\n168\n00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.880\nto the suppliers practitioners, this is\na different kind of an interface, right?\n\n169\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.090\nSo you'll have to manage the details\nof stakeholder management as well,\n\n170\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.870\nif you're talking to a service owner\nwithin the service organization,\n\n171\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.440\nthat's different than\ntalking to a process owner.\n\n172\n00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.450\nSo I understand that there's\nnuances below these major groups.\n\n173\n00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.160\nBut I like the fact that\nthere's four big ones here,\n\n174\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.800\nespecially as you're approaching the exam.\n\n175\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.220\nIn that these four groups need to be\nrepresented in almost all cases, right.\n\n176\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.210\nSo, if you're evaluating a question.\n\n177\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.770\nAnd you'll see that some of\nthe stakeholder groups are included, and\n\n178\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.020\nothers are not.\n\n179\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.660\nYou might wanna be suspect about\nthat particular answer, right?\n\n180\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.110\nBecause, you need to be more\ninclusive of all four groups.\n\n181\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.230\nJust a takeaway there, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.470\nAll right and moving forward.\n\n183\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.170\nInternal and external services,\nthis is just flipping the coin.\n\n184\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.180\nEarlier we had an external\nservice provider,\n\n185\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.900\nan internal service provider,\nwell what about the customer side?\n\n186\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.720\nFlip the coin a little bit,\n\n187\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.000\nyou got internal customers,\nyou have external customers.\n\n188\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.030\nAnd again, it's somewhat of\na distinction without a difference.\n\n189\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.900\nYou need to deliver value to\ncustomers whether they work for\n\n190\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.970\nthe same organization as you or\nwhether you're selling your services for\n\n191\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.200\nprofit, you need to deliver value.\n\n192\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.500\nSo these principles apply equally to both\ntypes of services whether it's internal or\n\n193\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.090\nexternal, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.180\nAnd moving forward here you'll\nsee just some examples.\n\n195\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.730\nHere you see an organization.\n\n196\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.820\nLet's take the bank for\nexample, just any given bank.\n\n197\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.560\nEnough folks, you don't use a bank,\nyou're actually a customer of IT services.\n\n198\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.128\nIf you go to an ATM machine,\nyou are using an IT service, right.\n\n199\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.240\nSomething's going on in the background and\nITs making that happen.\n\n200\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.250\nYou get your money out of the ATM right,\n\n201\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.090\nthey know it's you through identity\nmanagement involved, so you're logging in.\n\n202\n00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.457\nSo you are a customer\noutside of that organization,\n\n203\n00:11:19.457 --> 00:11:23.219\nyou don't work for the bank,\nthat's using IT services.\n\n204\n00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:28.147\nAnd then you might have a commercial\nloan department that uses very specific\n\n205\n00:11:28.147 --> 00:11:32.800\nIT services for managing commercial\nloans versus residential loans.\n\n206\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.310\nMaybe those are two separate\ndivisions within the bank, right?\n\n207\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.170\nYou might have financial services for\ninvestment portfolio management that uses\n\n208\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.450\nIT services quite a bit differently\nthan the loan side of the business.\n\n209\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.850\nAnd then of course, you have tellers\nmanaging the consumer banking where people\n\n210\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:55.140\ncome in and get money making deposits and\ngetting money in front of a live teller.\n\n211\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.700\nThey're using IT services\nperhaps differently.\n\n212\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.870\nYou've got the facilities maintenance,\nright.\n\n213\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.450\nHow do you keep power at these banks,\n\n214\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:07.000\nhow do you keep the networks\nfunctional how are the server back up.\n\n215\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.230\nWe have all that going on in\na shared services kinda way.\n\n216\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.940\nSo any given IT organization\n\n217\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.050\ncould have all three of this type of\nservices playing at a given time, right.\n\n218\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.664\nSo again, it is important to understand\nthat distinction among those type of\n\n219\n00:12:20.664 --> 00:12:21.618\nservices, right.\n\n220\n00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:27.035\nBut it's also key to know that this\nprinciple of ITIL apply all of them,\n\n221\n00:12:27.035 --> 00:12:27.704\nright.\n\n222\n00:12:27.704 --> 00:12:29.910\nAll right.\n\n223\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.440\nSo another way of looking at services,\n\n224\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:37.090\nwe have types of service providers that we\nsaw earlier, internal shared and external.\n\n225\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:42.690\nYou also have types of services core,\nenabling, and enhancing services.\n\n226\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.060\nAs example, I could use perhaps\nemail as a core service.\n\n227\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.000\nMost people understand email, right?\n\n228\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.720\nI remember when we first got email,\nthe ability to send and\n\n229\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.550\nreceive electronic messages,\nelectronic mail, right?\n\n230\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.146\nEnabling services all those\nthings in the backend,\n\n231\n00:13:02.146 --> 00:13:06.560\nat their servers there's networks,\nthere is identity management working.\n\n232\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.410\nRight, you have these services\nunderneath the hood if you will\n\n233\n00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.230\nthat allow email to work.\n\n234\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.480\nSo, the core service is email,\n\n235\n00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.490\nthe enabling service are underneath\nthe hood so to speak, right.\n\n236\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.137\nOr supporting services is another name for\nenabling, right.\n\n237\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.240\nAnd then enhance in services as\nan example, staying with the email,\n\n238\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.920\ndepending on the subject matter an email\nit might need to be archived for\n\n239\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.870\nlonger periods of time right.\n\n240\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.860\nAnd some types of communication must be\npreserved for an official record right.\n\n241\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.700\nOther types of email does not, so\n\n242\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.430\nyou have a distinguishing\ncharacteristics about record retention.\n\n243\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.630\nSo you have a little service,\nan enhancing service for email archiving.\n\n244\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.730\nRight, most people don't worry about it.\n\n245\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.350\nPerhaps it's the organization but\n\n246\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.960\nthe legal team is concerned about it and\nthe compliance team is concerned about it.\n\n247\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.850\nSo they make sure there\nis a service available\n\n248\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.505\nto serve their record\nretention needs as well.\n\n249\n00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:07.075\nSo again core email,\nenabling the backend services\n\n250\n00:14:07.075 --> 00:14:11.345\nlike identity management servers and\nnetworks and then enhancing services.\n\n251\n00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:15.845\nEnhancing services are those additional\nservices that may be a subset\n\n252\n00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:19.675\nof your organization needs\nto provide value, right.\n\n253\n00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:22.915\nI can take a more consumer approach\ninstead of an IT approach.\n\n254\n00:14:22.915 --> 00:14:27.370\nImagine your cable TV provider.\n\n255\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.280\nThe core service, and the various tiers.\n\n256\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.480\nThe basic service versus premium services.\n\n257\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.340\nYou get different kinds of content and\nyou pay different amounts of money.\n\n258\n00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.220\nBut the core service is still the same,\nin that you're able to watch TV, right?\n\n259\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.700\nEnabling services, again,\nwhat is your cable provider?\n\n260\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.150\nThey have enabling services, the\ntechnicians that come and do the install.\n\n261\n00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.680\nAnd perhaps there's the maintenance\nof the boxes themselves, right.\n\n262\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.840\nThey have a network they have to maintain.\n\n263\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.050\nThere are the support services when\nyou call someone with an outage,\n\n264\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:03.270\nthose enabling services allow this core\nservice to be delivered more effectively.\n\n265\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.430\nAnd then enhancing services could be those\nthings that you pay additional for for\n\n266\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.320\na subset of the service offerings like,\npaper view or\n\n267\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.770\npremium channels and that sort of thing.\n\n268\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.970\nNot everyone necessarily gets the core,\nother people get different ones.\n\n269\n00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.872\nThese is examples.\n\n270\n00:15:21.872 --> 00:15:23.860\nAll right, the idea of utility and\n\n271\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.394\nwarranty are central to delivering value,\nright?\n\n272\n00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:32.345\nThese words will show up on the exam,\nguarantee you in some form, right.\n\n273\n00:15:32.345 --> 00:15:35.725\nThey may say, fit for\npurpose or fit for use.\n\n274\n00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:38.210\nThey may use the synonyms, right?\n\n275\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.283\nBut utility and\nwarranty are core deliverables for\n\n276\n00:15:42.283 --> 00:15:47.964\nan IT service provider, if you can\ndeliver both utility and warranty,\n\n277\n00:15:47.964 --> 00:15:53.472\nyou're able to deliver value,\nutility is the functionality side.\n\n278\n00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:53.981\nRight?\n\n279\n00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:58.370\nYou're either removing a constraint or\nenhancing performance.\n\n280\n00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.470\nIf you are old enough to\nremember the days before email,\n\n281\n00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.826\nyou'll remember-\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n282\n00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:03.333\n&gt;&gt; Yup, me too.\n\n283\n00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:05.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got mail.\n\n284\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:06.430\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n285\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:13.670\nEmail actually enhances the performance\nof communication, right?\n\n286\n00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.150\nBefore, interoffice memos with\n\n287\n00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.010\nprinted pieces of paper going into\na physical inbox and a physical outbox.\n\n288\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.530\nUsed to be way the you\ncommunicated officially, right?\n\n289\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.971\nSo email, as a IT service, is enhancing\nthe performance of communication, right?\n\n290\n00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:32.180\nThat's the ability it provides.\n\n291\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.200\nThe outcome member's email evolved.\n\n292\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.600\nWhen I first got email, I had to be\nat work on a company computer, right,\n\n293\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.660\nand then I could use email.\n\n294\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.030\nThat constraint was removed.\n\n295\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.730\nIt's still the same service of email,\nbut that constraint was removed, and\n\n296\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.170\nit had to be at work.\n\n297\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.880\nI can be at home through a VPN connection,\nfor instance.\n\n298\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Remotely access.\n\n299\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.930\n&gt;&gt; Remotely accessing it, right?\n\n300\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.840\nBut I still had to be on a company laptop.\n\n301\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.520\nIt couldn't be just any other one.\n\n302\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.990\nThat constraint was removed, and my golly,\nwe can get our phones out now of our\n\n303\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.950\npocket and get our email,\nour official work email, to our phone.\n\n304\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.560\nSo I don't even have to be on a laptop,\n\n305\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.080\nI can have my own device and\nstill get email.\n\n306\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.960\nSo again, the same service,\nwhich was enhancing the performance of\n\n307\n00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.870\ncommunication, is now even more valuable\nbecause the constraints are being removed.\n\n308\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:26.780\nSo you can deliver value through enhancing\nperformance on the utility side,\n\n309\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.170\nor you can deliver value on the utility\nside by removing constraints, right?\n\n310\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.370\nA warranty is is the service\nthere when it's supposed to be?\n\n311\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.130\nIs it performing as it's supposed to,\nright?\n\n312\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.920\nIs it there performing as it needs to be?\n\n313\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.800\nSo this is really talking about\navailability, continuity,\n\n314\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.610\nis it secure enough, right?\n\n315\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.010\nDoes it have sufficient capacity?\n\n316\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.460\nSo the warranty aspects\nof delivering value\n\n317\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.900\nreally deal with not the functionality, or\n\n318\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:00.340\nthe business process enhancement, it deals\nwith is this service actually available?\n\n319\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.630\nWhen it's suppose to be available and\n\n320\n00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.660\nperforming as it suppose to be performing,\nright?\n\n321\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.330\nIt's not the bells and\nwhistles of interface design and\n\n322\n00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.650\nusability, that's what utility is.\n\n323\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:16.470\nWarranty is about the hard brass tax of,\nis this thing available and ready to go.\n\n324\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.860\nBoth are in play,\n\n325\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.560\nit's possible to have a highly\nfunctional service with bad warranty.\n\n326\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.140\nYou know, it falls over all time.\n\n327\n00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.983\nIts also possible to have\na highly available, you know,\n\n328\n00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.760\npiece of dung that's not very good for\npeople, right?\n\n329\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.640\nThey don't like it,\nthey don't even use it.\n\n330\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.500\nAnd it's there all the time, I can sure\ngo use that application anytime I want.\n\n331\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.820\nBut who needs it?\n\n332\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.030\nI'd rather use paper, that sort of thing.\n\n333\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.580\nSo both are in play.\n\n334\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.604\nIf you fail on one,\n\n335\n00:18:44.604 --> 00:18:48.328\nyou're going to be less likely to\ndeliver on the value proposition.\n\n336\n00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:54.680\nYou gotta be able to deliver both\nutility and warranty, all right.\n\n337\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.760\nAnd this is just a graph showing how\nworking on warranty reduces variability.\n\n338\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.810\nWorking on utility increases\nthe possible gains.\n\n339\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.620\nJust a graphic to show you.\n\n340\n00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.832\nThis graph and 25 cents will get you\na bad cup of coffee on exam day.\n\n341\n00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:12.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.770\n&gt;&gt; And who doesn't want a bad cup\n\n343\n00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.885\nof coffee on exam day?\n\n344\n00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] it's right, exactly.\n\n345\n00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.920\nWho doesn't?\n\n346\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.340\nThat's right.\n\n347\n00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.100\nAll right.\n\n348\n00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.670\nNow, again, taking language and\ngiving its own meaning.\n\n349\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.080\nThe word asset just happens to be\na word that ITIL has taken, and\n\n350\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.810\ngiven a very specific meaning.\n\n351\n00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:31.490\nAsset simply means a resource or\ncapability, right?\n\n352\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:36.190\nIn some other context, perhaps asset means\nsomething that you stick a label on, and\n\n353\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.630\nstart tracking for financial purposes.\n\n354\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.430\nOkay, it's still that, but\nit's a lot more nuanced than that.\n\n355\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.740\nAn asset is any resource or\n\n356\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.170\ncapability, whether that resource has\nan asset tag slapped on it or not, right?\n\n357\n00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.860\nAnd of course, capability is a little\nsofter, a little more intangible,\n\n358\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.950\nit's about skill sets, right?\n\n359\n00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.790\nAnother important aspect\nis that resources and\n\n360\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:02.205\ncapabilities reside in two domains,\nthey reside with the customer assets,\n\n361\n00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:05.328\nand they reside within\nthe IT service provider.\n\n362\n00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:09.960\nA way to illustrate this is,\ndo you have to be\n\n363\n00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.100\na geophysicist to work in the IT\ndepartment of an oil company?\n\n364\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.290\nHopefully, more of a rhetorical answer, of\ncourse you don't have to be a geophysicist\n\n365\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.380\nto work in the IT department\nof an oil company?\n\n366\n00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.930\nDo you have to be a lawyer to work\nin the IT department of a law firm?\n\n367\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.590\nNo, that's the assets\nthat the lawyers bring.\n\n368\n00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.880\nThat's their smarts,\nthat's their resources and capabilities.\n\n369\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.710\nThe customer assets are important.\n\n370\n00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.160\nThe geophysicist that\nworks at the oil company.\n\n371\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.370\nHe brings his assets,\nhis resources and capabilities.\n\n372\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.110\nTo the game of finding oil and\ngetting it out of the ground, right?\n\n373\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.830\nSo they bring their skills,\nyou bring yours, right?\n\n374\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.510\nYou bring your resources or capabilities.\n\n375\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:58.584\nSo, IT service providers, the service\nassets or what you bring to the game,\n\n376\n00:20:58.584 --> 00:21:03.070\nand of course the customer\nbrings their assets to the game.\n\n377\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.910\nTogether, you're going to match\nthe right type of assets on the IT side,\n\n378\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.420\ntheir resource and capabilities,\nto what the customer's trying to get done\n\n379\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.540\nto generate value or\nto generate business outcomes.\n\n380\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.450\nThat's how they set\nthese things up in ITIL.\n\n381\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.060\nTwo types of assets,\nare resources and capabilities.\n\n382\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.880\nThey exist in two domains.\n\n383\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.420\nCustomer assets and service assets.\n\n384\n00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.870\nA process, again, rogue definition here,\na structured set of activities\n\n385\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.459\ndesigned to accomplish\na specific objective, right?\n\n386\n00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:40.350\nITIL describes 26 of them.\n\n387\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:45.010\nI'm not going to short-change this any.\n\n388\n00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.480\nAs we go through and do our process\nreviews throughout this course,\n\n389\n00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.910\nI want you to refocus or\nre-energize your learning if you will,\n\n390\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.255\nbecause perhaps you've\nknown this from the past.\n\n391\n00:21:57.255 --> 00:22:01.143\nRe-energize your learning about\nthe value of these processes.\n\n392\n00:22:01.143 --> 00:22:04.680\nIf you're considering managing\nacross the lifecycle.\n\n393\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.721\nAgain, 5000 foot view, and\nyou're looking at IT service management as\n\n394\n00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:14.683\na strategic asset, which is what MALK\nhas you do, then you're necessarily\n\n395\n00:22:14.683 --> 00:22:19.511\nlooking at the strategic value of each\none of these intrinsic processes.\n\n396\n00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:22.905\nSo as we're learning and\ngoing through these episodes,\n\n397\n00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:28.080\nre-energize the value proposition for each\nof the processes we learned, all right?\n\n398\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.310\nProcess characteristics, as you see here,\nthey support business processes for sure.\n\n399\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.660\nThey have four characteristics.\n\n400\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.530\nThey are measurable.\n\n401\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:45.030\nThe implication of measuring a process\nis that you actually measure it.\n\n402\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.130\nIt's one thing that's measurable, it's\nanother thing to actually do measurement.\n\n403\n00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.900\nAs you've learned in previous courses,\nmeasurement is the key to improvement.\n\n404\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.470\nYou can't begin to manage what\nyou can't measure, right?\n\n405\n00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.320\nSo, measurement is key.\n\n406\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.900\nAnd processes have measurements, too.\n\n407\n00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.210\nThey deliver specific results\nto specific stakeholders.\n\n408\n00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.680\nYou'll see the word customer here,\n\n409\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.670\ncustomer focus, sure,\nthese customers could be internal or\n\n410\n00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:15.480\nexternal to the IT organization, but\nthere is a recipient for the output.\n\n411\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.640\nThat's what they mean by customer and\n\n412\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.540\nmaking sure that the outputs\nof your results of the process\n\n413\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.710\nare actually something that can\nbe used by another stakeholder.\n\n414\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.250\nEven if that other\nstakeholder's within IT.\n\n415\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:32.145\nSo sure, customer focus, but\nI think I'd use a more broader term,\n\n416\n00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:35.320\nstakeholder-focused, whoever\nyour stakeholder might be.\n\n417\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.180\nThe output of certain supplier\nmanagement process is gonna\n\n418\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.201\nbe going to a supplier for instance.\n\n419\n00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:48.176\nWith the customer in mind, you're going\nto be having a stakeholder as a supplier,\n\n420\n00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:49.891\njust as an example, right?\n\n421\n00:23:49.891 --> 00:23:51.732\nAnd something gets them started.\n\n422\n00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:53.490\nSo as we go through this review,\n\n423\n00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.750\nreenergize the interaction\namong these processes.\n\n424\n00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.760\nSo I invited you before, reenergize on\nthe value proposition of the process.\n\n425\n00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.090\nAlso reenergize on the points of\nintegration among the processes.\n\n426\n00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.300\nAgain, as you look at the strategic\nlevel down through the entire lifecycle,\n\n427\n00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.628\nthat's gonna be a necessary evil.\n\n428\n00:24:12.628 --> 00:24:16.370\nOkay, all right.\n\n429\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.810\nNow process model.\n\n430\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.150\nLots of words on here, but I just wanna\nbreak it down into the big concepts.\n\n431\n00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.940\nIn the orange bits here,\n\n432\n00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.210\na process control mechanism is that you\nactually want to know where you're going.\n\n433\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.940\nNotice that there's process policy\nas part of your model, right.\n\n434\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.940\nIt's also what are the process objectives.\n\n435\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.050\nThis is very high level.\n\n436\n00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.790\nProcess control is effectively about an\nappropriate strategy for your processes.\n\n437\n00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.350\nWhat are you trying to get done, and\nwhy is it important to you, right.\n\n438\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.510\nIs it so important that you need to\nhave a policy that says thou shalt\n\n439\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.045\nfollow the process?\n\n440\n00:24:51.045 --> 00:24:53.280\nSo it's one thing to have a process.\n\n441\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.720\nIt's another thing to make\nsure it's followed, right?\n\n442\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.500\nSo process policy is a way to kind\nof give some governance behind\n\n443\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.000\nthe policy to make sure that it has some\ncorporate backing, if you will, right?\n\n444\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.150\nNow, the process itself,\nyou've got process control.\n\n445\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:15.450\nAnd then, in the green bits here,\nyou got the process activities themselves.\n\n446\n00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.410\nThis is where it actually happens, right?\n\n447\n00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.920\nThis is where the process gets executed.\n\n448\n00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.700\nAnd then finally in the blue\nbits the people who get it done.\n\n449\n00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.170\nThe process enablers,\nthe ones that actually manage\n\n450\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.210\nthe process on a day to day basis,\nget it done day to day.\n\n451\n00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.690\nSo you have to have your\nprocess resources available\n\n452\n00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.168\nincluding the measure mechanisms etc.\n\n453\n00:25:36.168 --> 00:25:38.983\nAnd notice there's feedback\nloops among these.\n\n454\n00:25:38.983 --> 00:25:44.103\nThese arrows or double arrows, right,\nso it should be a constant source of\n\n455\n00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:50.073\nfeedback among the different elements of\nthe process model, right, simple as that.\n\n456\n00:25:50.073 --> 00:25:52.030\nAll right.\n\n457\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.420\nNow a function.\n\n458\n00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.050\nITIL describes four functions.\n\n459\n00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.920\nA function is a group of people\nwith special skills or tools.\n\n460\n00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.530\nYou might recall them as application\nmanagement and technical management.\n\n461\n00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:11.910\nWe also have the IT operations management\nand the service desk, those are the four.\n\n462\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.340\nA team of people with groups\nwith special skills and tools.\n\n463\n00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.850\nNow, this word function,\n\n464\n00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.120\nperhaps is an unfortunate word\nbecause function means so many things.\n\n465\n00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.610\nFunction can mean where you\ngo when you want cake and\n\n466\n00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.100\nice cream at the end of the celebration.\n\n467\n00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.860\n&gt;&gt; Highly important.\n\n468\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, highly important.\n\n469\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.610\nA function could be something\nwithin a database structure that\n\n470\n00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.340\nactually repeats something or actually\nexecutes something repeatable, right?\n\n471\n00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.741\nYou can go to the function to get\na little chain of events going on.\n\n472\n00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:47.398\nSo function has lots of meanings, right,\nand lots of different contexts that IT\n\n473\n00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:51.060\nhappens to use,\nincluding the cake and ice cream one.\n\n474\n00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.740\nBut function in ITIL simply means\na group of people with special skills or\n\n475\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.870\ntools, right.\n\n476\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.390\nSo perhaps and\nunfortunate use of the function,\n\n477\n00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.810\nmaybe functional area would\nhave been a better word.\n\n478\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.917\nI'm not gonna hash the syntax\nto this too much, but\n\n479\n00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:11.612\nyou need to understand that when they\nuse function as part of their language,\n\n480\n00:27:11.612 --> 00:27:15.604\nthey are using function in a very\nspecific way, related to ITIL.\n\n481\n00:27:15.604 --> 00:27:18.882\nSo just be wary of the word, okay.\n\n482\n00:27:18.882 --> 00:27:21.220\nSo that's just a lay of the land.\n\n483\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.370\nThat concludes this part of setting\nthe stage for the language of ITIL,\n\n484\n00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.340\nsome key concepts of ITIL.\n\n485\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.430\nIt's not new to you.\n\n486\n00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.420\nYou would have scraped your\nknuckles on these concepts\n\n487\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.320\nthroughout the foundation and\nintermediate level courses.\n\n488\n00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.430\nBut just setting the table,\n\n489\n00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.910\nwe're gonna be using that language\na lot in future episodes.\n\n490\n00:27:39.552 --> 00:27:44.100\n&gt;&gt; Terry, you did a great job and we're\ngonna continue on with more ITIL MALC.\n\n491\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.230\nLots of episodes you can watch and rewatch\nagain and again and then please do.\n\n492\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.870\nWell, thank you for watching ITProTV, and\nremember a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n493\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.770\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n494\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm Terry Decker.\n\n495\n00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.700\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you very soon.\n\n496\n00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:03.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n497\n00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:09.076\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.388\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:12.197\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:16.497\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to choose ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:19.600\nhelping you learn wherever you go\n&gt;&gt; I'm our host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.596\nAs we continue with ITIL, MALC, and\nthis is an exciting episode, and\n\n8\n00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:28.160\nbringing us all the information we need\nis Terry Decker, who's right here.\n\n9\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.878\nThat's Terry right there.\n\n10\n00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:29.472\n&gt;&gt; Hello, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:31.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Happy to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:34.580\nAs Zach said, we're gonna continue this\nmanaging across the life cycle course and\n\n13\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.550\nwe have a queued up for\nyou this time is some key concepts related\n\n14\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.100\nto the creation of value through service\nstrategy, and through service operations.\n\n15\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.320\nWe'll have a little sprinkling of some\nof the other processes in there as well.\n\n16\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.960\nSo first of all, diving in and\n\n17\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.540\nsomething we reinforced earlier\nis value to the business.\n\n18\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.920\nOnce upon a time, ITIL considered\nitself aligned with the business.\n\n19\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.894\nWhere you knew what they were up to,\nand you tried to meet their target.\n\n20\n00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:05.800\nCirca 2011,\nthey redesigned ITIL a little bit.\n\n21\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.110\nAnd republished publications, and\n\n22\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.850\ndecided that alignment, as valuable as\nthat is, should become integration.\n\n23\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.632\nSo, integrating with a business\nis a different prospect.\n\n24\n00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:20.740\nThat means, you're really going to be\nthat much closer to your customers,\n\n25\n00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.059\nand maybe even in their business a little\nbit, right, integrating with them.\n\n26\n00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:26.420\nSome customers might resist that.\n\n27\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.470\nSo one of the challenges that comes about\nas it's played out through this MALC exam\n\n28\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.710\nand this MALC experience, managed across\nthe life cycle, is that, this idea\n\n29\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.610\nof getting into the business, in with your\ncustomers, is a challenge worth taking.\n\n30\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.290\nAnd, you need to knock down that door,\nknock on the door,\n\n31\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.610\nknock it down if you need to, early and\noften in your relationships, right?\n\n32\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.790\nOf course, you're gonna deliver\nvalue through services.\n\n33\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.999\nWe talked about this in the earlier\nepisodes, value through services,\n\n34\n00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.732\nnot through just solutions.\n\n35\n00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:00.710\nYou can't just throw a solution\nout there and hope they like it.\n\n36\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.010\nYou're gonna have to be\ninvolved in providing service,\n\n37\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.160\nnot just solutions themselves.\n\n38\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.811\nSome key concepts here, value is\ndescribed, and defined by the customer.\n\n39\n00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.810\nYou know the phrase\nthe customer is always right?\n\n40\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.620\nI would challenge that,\nknow the customer can be wrong.\n\n41\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.430\nThey can be and you need to educate them.\n\n42\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.310\nThey could have wrong expectations for\n\n43\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.710\nus and\nsom they could have misguided perceptions.\n\n44\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.340\nBut it's possible you need to\ncorrect some customer behavior.\n\n45\n00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:32.160\nI'm not gonna paint it in such rosy\npictures that the customer's always right,\n\n46\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.430\nbut I will say this, if the customer's\n\n47\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.200\nperception of value is not tended to,\nyou will fail, right?\n\n48\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.620\nThe only opinion that matters when it\ncomes to value, is the customer's opinion.\n\n49\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.600\nWhen it comes to word value or\ndelivery of value.\n\n50\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.520\nIf they like it, if they're driving\nbusiness outcomes through your services,\n\n51\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.770\nthey're gonna see the value.\n\n52\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.920\nIf they can't see the value, then you've\nbecome a mysterious cost setter, right?\n\n53\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.140\nWe're not sure what you do IT,\nbut you sure cost a lot, right.\n\n54\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.838\nYou don't wanna be in that position,\nright.\n\n55\n00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:08.800\nYou don't wanna be in the position where\nyou're just a mysterious call center.\n\n56\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.210\nYou need to viewed by\nthe customers as a strategic asset\n\n57\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.010\nthat allows them to get their\njob done more effectively.\n\n58\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.570\nThat's where you need to go towards.\n\n59\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.842\nSo, focusing on what value means to them\nis the key component to this, right?\n\n60\n00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.270\nSo what is IT trying to get done?\n\n61\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.433\nAre really creating the value.\n\n62\n00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:33.319\nYou could do it through warranty,\nyou can do it through utility, but\n\n63\n00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.267\nreally what it comes down\nto on the customer side is,\n\n64\n00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:40.490\nare you able to let them get something\ndone, the business outcomes is key.\n\n65\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.255\nAs you can see in the upper right\nof this particular graphic,\n\n66\n00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:49.938\nbusiness outcomes is the primary\nfocus of creating value.\n\n67\n00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:54.410\nNow it would be nice if that's all we had\nto worry about, just business outcomes.\n\n68\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.210\nBut we also have to be concerned with\ntheir perceptions, or their preferences.\n\n69\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.810\nI'll give you a non-IT example\nto distinguish the difference\n\n70\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.127\nbetween business outcomes and\npreferences or perceptions.\n\n71\n00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:14.462\nLet's say what you've been asked\nto do is to design a service that\n\n72\n00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:19.811\nallows the user to lower the window\nof their automobile, right?\n\n73\n00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.000\nAgain, a non IT example.\n\n74\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.510\nYou've been asked to\ndesign such a solution.\n\n75\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.140\nSo, you go back to the shop.\n\n76\n00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.821\nYou researched the regulatory\nrequirements, the safety requirements,\n\n77\n00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:33.609\nthe cost benefit analysis.\n\n78\n00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:37.141\nAnd you come up with what you\nthink is the perfect solution for\n\n79\n00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:40.396\nthe business outcome of\nlowering the window in the car,\n\n80\n00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:43.318\nand what you delivered is a crank handle,\nright?\n\n81\n00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:44.274\nIt works.\n\n82\n00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:45.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The customer says,\n\n83\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.680\nI don't want a crank handle, right?\n\n84\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.860\nI don't want that.\n\n85\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.910\nAnd you would be silly to say,\nwhat do you mean you don't want it?\n\n86\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.510\nIt's exactly what you need.\n\n87\n00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.730\nIt's cost effective, it didn't cost\nnearly as much as an electric window.\n\n88\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.480\nIf you drive into a lake,\n\n89\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.540\nyou can still get your window\ndown if the power goes out.\n\n90\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.795\nIs so satisfying all of our\nsafety requirements, right?\n\n91\n00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:09.038\nThere's no real pinch factor\ninvolved here, right?\n\n92\n00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:11.880\nYou're not gonna accidentally roll\nthe window up on your finger,\n\n93\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.820\nyour child's finger, chances are, right?\n\n94\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.720\nSo what are you worried about, customer?\n\n95\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.030\nGo back and\nenjoy your crank handle, right?\n\n96\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.912\nYou can't do that, obviously.\n\n97\n00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:25.830\nYou're gonna have to deliver not just what\nthey need in terms of business outcomes,\n\n98\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.090\nbut you're gonna have to satisfy their\npreferences and their perceptions.\n\n99\n00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.810\nThey may perceive that particular\nsolution as old, outdated, not effective,\n\n100\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.260\nnot convenient enough, right.\n\n101\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.680\nAnd then you go back and\nyou do a push button.\n\n102\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.590\nAnd then they want, don't hold it down,\n\n103\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.060\nI just wanna press it once, I want it\nto be automatic just with one press.\n\n104\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.960\nAnd I want that one press\nto be both up and down.\n\n105\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.770\nRight, but what about defense factor?\n\n106\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.560\nYou could hurt your child's fingers.\n\n107\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.255\nWell, I want some anti-roll.\n\n108\n00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.690\nIf it meets some resistance, I wanna\nit to automatically roll back then.\n\n109\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.670\nAnd you get the idea,\nhow complex this value proposition can be.\n\n110\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.750\nBut if you're not interrogating\nthe customer about their preferences and\n\n111\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.200\nperceptions, and only interrogating\nthem about the business outcomes,\n\n112\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.480\nyou could miss out on the true\nvalue proposition that they need.\n\n113\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.580\nAnd again, at the end of the day,\n\n114\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.155\nno matter how righteous you might be\nin your designing of this solution,\n\n115\n00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:25.707\ncost effective, safety regulators are off\nour back, it's field replaceable units,\n\n116\n00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:29.103\nthis is obviously the best choice for\nyour customer.\n\n117\n00:06:29.103 --> 00:06:31.394\nYou're not gonna be winning that\nargument at the end of the day,\n\n118\n00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:34.460\nif they have different perceptions and\npreferences in mind.\n\n119\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.190\nSo, as this plays out in an exam as you\nare looking at exam considerations,\n\n120\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.660\nit will be clear where\nthe customer wants to go.\n\n121\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.710\nRight, and if it's not clear,\nthen your goal is to make clarity, right,\n\n122\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.560\nis to create clarity.\n\n123\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.400\nIf you're not sure what the customer wants\nin terms of perceptions or preferences,\n\n124\n00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.980\nif scenario plays out that way then\nyou need to interrogate that, right?\n\n125\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.770\nYou just can't simply consider the\noutcomes part of the value proposition.\n\n126\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.690\n&gt;&gt; And of course, those interrogations are\nvery friendly as you make the deep dive\n\n127\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.020\ninto finding out exactly\nwhat they need and want.\n\n128\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n129\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.763\nI guess interrogation does sound like kind\nof a mean where with bright lights and\n\n130\n00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:14.535\nsweaty palms, and slap [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:15.669\n&gt;&gt; Exactly [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.140\nGood on the sign, very good, right.\n\n133\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.770\nSo again, digging into the perceptions\nis gonna be a big part of it.\n\n134\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.510\nThis is just simply a graphic that\nsuggests that you talk to them often, and\n\n135\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.780\nearly, and that you have\na net positive result, right?\n\n136\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.008\nThis graphic just simply shows\nthat at the end of the day,\n\n137\n00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:37.529\nyou need to be having net positive value\nproposition instead of a negative one.\n\n138\n00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.308\nIf it's gonna cost $5 million\nto deliver this IT service, and\n\n139\n00:07:42.308 --> 00:07:44.172\nthey're paying for it.\n\n140\n00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.800\nAnd at the end of the day, they get\na return on their investment of only,\n\n141\n00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.450\n200,000, well,\nthat's not a very good positive.\n\n142\n00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.977\nSo it could be money driven, right?\n\n143\n00:07:52.977 --> 00:07:54.645\nIt could be value driven, right?\n\n144\n00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:59.061\nThey may like the idea of a push button\nbutton on the push button window.\n\n145\n00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:02.682\nThey may like that so much,\nthey're just simply delighted, right?\n\n146\n00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.972\nAnd they like you more because you\ndelivered a push button approach.\n\n147\n00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:06.603\nRight.\n\n148\n00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:07.723\nLet's take that to IT.\n\n149\n00:08:07.723 --> 00:08:11.260\nYou've automated something it's\ntaken them five days before.\n\n150\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.500\nRight.\nNow it's easy,\n\n151\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.530\nthey push a button and the results\nare available within two hours.\n\n152\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.040\nRight.\n\n153\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.890\nThey have to answer a few questions,\nright.\n\n154\n00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.600\nSo they have a few data\ninputs they have to make.\n\n155\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.480\nBut at the end of the day,\nthey push a button at the end and\n\n156\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.790\nthey have that magic report,\nready to go within two hours.\n\n157\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.550\nWhat used to take them manually\nfive days to get done, by you\n\n158\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.350\nknow moving paper around and giving it\nto a clerk to type it in this format and\n\n159\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.660\nreformat it over here then doing a\ngraphical review and manage sort of thing.\n\n160\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.140\nSo, if you give them a net positive\nbecause you're saving them time,\n\n161\n00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.900\nsaving them money then you're\ngonna be able to overvalued.\n\n162\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.960\nIf it's in that negative\nobviously you're not.\n\n163\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.598\nRight, pretty straightforward.\n\n164\n00:08:53.598 --> 00:08:58.610\nNow, interesting challenge\n\n165\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:04.490\nhow do you position yourself as\na valuable asset to your customers.\n\n166\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.400\nITIL is suggesting that you need to have\nbasically a skill set within your IT\n\n167\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.360\norganization that's a whole\nlot like marketing.\n\n168\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.580\nIt's a whole lot like sales, right?\n\n169\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.100\nYou have the happy face of IT.\n\n170\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.050\nI'm not disparaging the highly technical\npeople you need in the back end to\n\n171\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.130\nmake this stuff real.\n\n172\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.360\nI mean you need developers, you need\nserver people, identity management people,\n\n173\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.180\nyou need security people,\nyou need a lot of smart people\n\n174\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.690\nthat understand the deep dives of\nthe technology, without question, right?\n\n175\n00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.190\nBut you also need to be able to\npresent your IT organization, and\n\n176\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.410\nyour service assets,\nin a way that's sellable.\n\n177\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.070\nSo taking a marketing mindset\n\n178\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.520\nto your IT organization is\na good recommendation from ITIL.\n\n179\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.500\nAs this plays out on the exam,\n\n180\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.620\nyou might find scenarios where\nthat's really weak, right?\n\n181\n00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.480\nThat you're not able to do the soft sell,\nif you will, you're always talking techno\n\n182\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.830\njargon and customers, again, are seeing\nyou as the mysterious cost center.\n\n183\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.639\nYou just used five acronyms,\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n184\n00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go away, right?\n\n185\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.190\nSo you need to come and\n\n186\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.070\ndeliver a value proposition to\nthe customers that makes sense to them\n\n187\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.110\nwithout every mentioning the bit bucket\nin the back that makes it happen.\n\n188\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.650\n&gt;&gt; You need to speak in a language\nthat they can understand, of course.\n\n189\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.190\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly right.\n\n190\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.580\nSo again,\nnot really rocket science here, but\n\n191\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.330\nas this plays out through your\nexam you could find this missing.\n\n192\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.390\nNow you may recall that the process that\ngoverns interactions with the customers,\n\n193\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.630\nparticularly at a strategic\nlevel where you're trying to\n\n194\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.330\nascertain their requirements.\n\n195\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.140\nWhat value looks like to them is BRM,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n196\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.260\nSo, if you're looking at the scenario and\nthe case study and\n\n197\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.070\nyou find weaknesses in BRM then the\nmanifestation in that weakness could be\n\n198\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.680\na misalignment of the value propositions\nwhere IT seems to be going down the wrong\n\n199\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.940\npath not in the interest of the customer.\n\n200\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.590\nAll right,\njust trying to connect the dots there.\n\n201\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.000\nNow there's a difference between\nvalue added and value realized.\n\n202\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.160\nI like this for a lot of reasons.\n\n203\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.870\nI mean, we understand perhaps\nin the back end of IT,\n\n204\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:17.402\nwe might understand the value of\nlet's say a Server virtualization.\n\n205\n00:11:17.402 --> 00:11:22.640\nA relatively recent evolution\nin IT service management,\n\n206\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.380\nor IT service delivery, has been\nthis idea of virtualizing servers.\n\n207\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.340\nSo instead of buying a big box,\nmultiple big boxes,\n\n208\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.360\nyou can buy a big box and\nvirtualize a service with inside it.\n\n209\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.870\nSave money, save administrative costs and\nIT certainly embraced this virtualization\n\n210\n00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.920\nfor the cost savings of technical\nadministration, if nothing else.\n\n211\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.470\nThat's value added, but until you're\nactually doing something on behalf\n\n212\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.080\nof the customer, you're not actually\nrealizing any value right, so\n\n213\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.010\nyour adding value to\nthrough this initiatives.\n\n214\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.990\nI'm not saying that virtualization\nis either good or bad.\n\n215\n00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.210\nI'm saying that you can't\ntranslate it into value realize\n\n216\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.470\nuntil your converting this value that you\nhave into some sort of customer outcome.\n\n217\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:14.490\nSo as good as we are identifying\nopportunities within IT to enhance IT\n\n218\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.350\nthrough speed automation, through\nvirtualization, perhaps through cloud\n\n219\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.340\ncomputing, all the various things\nwe consider to make IT better.\n\n220\n00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.540\nSo it's good,\nI'm not saying that's wasted effort.\n\n221\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.380\nBut you need to translate that\ninto value to the business.\n\n222\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.590\nThat's the key here.\n\n223\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.730\nSo the difference between value added and\n\n224\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.550\nvalue realized is the difference\nbetween being a mysterious cost center,\n\n225\n00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.950\ndoing things in the back end that\ncost a lot of money, but to what end?\n\n226\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.230\nA mysterious cost center.\n\n227\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.540\nSo good, reinforcing those rules.\n\n228\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.270\nSo service strategy is\ntrying to link this up,\n\n229\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.960\ntrying to link the value added to value\nrealized, through business outcomes.\n\n230\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.510\nSo if you know what the business is\ntrying to do- I mean, take any business.\n\n231\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.410\nI mean, I don't know the oil\nindustry very well, hardly at all.\n\n232\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.450\nI did a little bit of consulting\nwith them a few months ago.\n\n233\n00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.770\nBut really, what an oil company\nis trying to do is find the oil\n\n234\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.360\nget it out of the ground and\nget it distributed.\n\n235\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.000\nAnd maybe later on maybe they\nhave vertical market and\n\n236\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.130\nthey're also doing the refinery piece and\nthen redistributing that.\n\n237\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.120\nRight.\nThere could be different layers\n\n238\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.250\nin this business.\n\n239\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.650\nBut that's what you can break down.\n\n240\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.722\nWhat are they trying to get done or\ntrying to find out?\n\n241\n00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:26.898\nHow can I.T. help them find it?\n\n242\n00:13:26.898 --> 00:13:28.910\nHow can I.T. help them extract it?\n\n243\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.720\nWhat's the best approach to satisfying\nthe regulatory requirements?\n\n244\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.460\nThe speed requirements?\n\n245\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.030\nThe safety requirements?\n\n246\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.960\nWhatever those might be,\n\n247\n00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.860\nIT can help all along that value\nchain that the business has.\n\n248\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.390\nHow?\n\n249\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.130\nIs the big question, right?\n\n250\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.780\nAnd making sure you have\nthat focus on the business.\n\n251\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.240\nThat integration with the business.\n\n252\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.860\nNot just alignment, but understanding\nwhat they're trying to get done.\n\n253\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.700\nSo hypothetically let's say what the oil\ncompany wants to do is find it faster,\n\n254\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:05.340\nfind it more safely and\nfind it in regulatory compliance and\n\n255\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.040\ntaking care of the risk of\nregulatory compliance issues.\n\n256\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.950\nSo you have compliance, you have speed and\n\n257\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.830\nyou have quality, basically is\nwhat you are trying to deal with.\n\n258\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.420\nHow can IT approach those three factors?\n\n259\n00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.770\nWhat are you going to bring to that game?\n\n260\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.360\nSimple as that, right.\n\n261\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.720\nKnow what they're trying to do.\n\n262\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.140\nSo if they're trying to find it faster,\nwhy not measure speed?\n\n263\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.440\nRight.\n\n264\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.450\nCertainly the business\nis gonna measure speed.\n\n265\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.660\nHow about measuring how your\nIT service makes it faster?\n\n266\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.520\nThat's integration.\n\n267\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.560\nIt's one thing to say we have\na server that's up 24/7.\n\n268\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.140\nIt's always there,\nwhat are you worried about?\n\n269\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.130\nWell actually that service is\navailable all the time, but\n\n270\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.508\nwe're finding the oil just\nas slow as we always did.\n\n271\n00:14:49.508 --> 00:14:52.630\nSo, that three million dollars\nwe spent on the new IT service\n\n272\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.870\nis not delivering the business\noutcome of finding it faster, right?\n\n273\n00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.605\nGet the idea there?\n\n274\n00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:00.590\nMm-hm, okay, absolutely.\n\n275\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:06.810\nSo again, the difference between adding\nvalue and adding a value realized,\n\n276\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.740\nrealizing value is all based\non the business outcomes.\n\n277\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.630\nSo as you're taking this exam,\nthese are concepts we've talked\n\n278\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.499\nabout throughout all the intermediate\ncourses, including foundation actually.\n\n279\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.900\nSo nothing new here.\n\n280\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.800\nBut as you're looking at this mock exam\nand considering the value proposition,\n\n281\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.040\nalways look through the eyes of\nthe business or the customer.\n\n282\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.210\nJust synonyms there, the same thing.\n\n283\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.140\nYou can't be looking it through the eyes\nof IT and get the full picture.\n\n284\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.800\nYou'll end up creating that crank handle.\n\n285\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.610\nInstead of what they really needed or\nwhat they really wanted.\n\n286\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.860\n&gt;&gt; Customer value service.\n\n287\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.380\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n288\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.870\nCustomer value services.\n\n289\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.650\nSo what's the challenge in this?\n\n290\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.250\nHaving that relationship with\nthe customer that's so synergetic.\n\n291\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.470\nYou're so connected to them that\nyou are integrated with them.\n\n292\n00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.040\nFirst of all, if you have a reputation of\nbeing the mysterious cost center, they\n\n293\n00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.540\nalready kind of have a stiff hand up to\nyou, saying, I don't want to talk to you.\n\n294\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.980\nGo talk your IT jargon to someone else.\n\n295\n00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.717\nRight?\nI'm considering outsourcing you next year\n\n296\n00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:05.644\nanyway, right?\n\n297\n00:16:05.644 --> 00:16:07.962\nThat's not a great place to be in, right?\n\n298\n00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:12.929\nSo if If you already are trying to fight\nback your reputation, or gain back your\n\n299\n00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:18.560\nreputation, you're fighting to regain\nyour reputation as a strategic partner.\n\n300\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.640\nThen obviously, it's gonna be a challenge,\nright, that could be a challenge.\n\n301\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.620\nWherever you are in that relationship\nwith your business customers,\n\n302\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.340\nthe challenge of being integrated\nwith them is going to be.\n\n303\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.078\nEven if you have a solid reputation,\nyou are not a geophysicist.\n\n304\n00:16:33.078 --> 00:16:37.238\nSo that geophysicist is gonna be scoffing\nat the mere IT guys thinking they can help\n\n305\n00:16:37.238 --> 00:16:38.660\nme do my job better.\n\n306\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.710\nThat's just a human dynamic of their\nskill set plus your skill set, right?\n\n307\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.940\nThey'll say mind your own business IT,\nI got some mold to discover here, right,\n\n308\n00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.340\nthat sort of thing.\n\n309\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.175\nSo the challenge of\nintegrating with a business,\n\n310\n00:16:51.175 --> 00:16:53.880\nit's permanent, it's always there.\n\n311\n00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.150\nIn fact, a challenge is a risk that\nhas a 100% chance of happening.\n\n312\n00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.782\nYou're gonna be facing this challenge in\nIT, right, so it's not gonna go away.\n\n313\n00:17:02.782 --> 00:17:06.146\nHow can you mitigate that challenge,\nhow can you relax that challenge,\n\n314\n00:17:06.146 --> 00:17:08.406\nhow can you get better at\nfacing that challenge,\n\n315\n00:17:08.406 --> 00:17:12.220\nis really what ITIL is trying to\nposition you for, that kind of success.\n\n316\n00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.010\nAll right.\n\n317\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n318\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.340\nagain, focusing on the business\nvalue gets you there.\n\n319\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.160\nIf you have their heart in mind,\ntheir soul in mind, and\n\n320\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.700\nnot your own,\nyou're gonna be in a better place.\n\n321\n00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.370\nAll right, so\nyou do this through good relationships.\n\n322\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.690\nBRM is certainly gonna be the process\nthat overarchingly governs that.\n\n323\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.939\nWe'll talk in some detail about\nthat a little bit later on.\n\n324\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.100\nJust killing this horse with one more,\na couple of beats.\n\n325\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.230\nBusiness value is the goal,\nnot IT value, right.\n\n326\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:48.020\nValue capture within IT is good,\nvalue adding within IT is good.\n\n327\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.020\nAdopting ITIL is value add,\nyou're adding value to the IT\n\n328\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.350\norganization when you adopt ITIL, but\nyou're not really realizing value until\n\n329\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.190\nyou can translate that value added\ninto some sort of business outcome.\n\n330\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.690\nThat's the challenge of managing\nacross a life cycle, operationally,\n\n331\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.980\nback at work, and\nacademically on this exam,\n\n332\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.070\nhow do you capture value that's\nrealized by the business?\n\n333\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.160\nAll right.\n\n334\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.850\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n335\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.140\n&gt;&gt; So we do this through functions.\n\n336\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.160\nWe had a brief review of\nfunctions earlier on.\n\n337\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.220\nHere they are in some form here,\nwe'll look at these individually.\n\n338\n00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.820\nWe got the service desk, we got IT\noperations, technical management and\n\n339\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.120\napplication management.\n\n340\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.380\nThese are the functions, groups of\npeople with special skills or tools.\n\n341\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.138\nA better word might be functional areas.\n\n342\n00:18:34.138 --> 00:18:36.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, the functionality.\n\n343\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.638\n&gt;&gt; It's not the functionality,\nthat's just it, functions, in this case,\n\n344\n00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:42.490\nis a very specific meaning,\nmeaning a group of people.\n\n345\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.055\nNow, ITIL doesn't really practice\norganizational structures,\n\n346\n00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:48.375\nthey're not really best practice for\nhow you set up your organization.\n\n347\n00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.745\nWhat ITIL is saying is,\n\n348\n00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:53.740\nthese are the skill sets you need to\nbring to a service IT organization.\n\n349\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.390\n&gt;&gt; So functions equal people.\n\n350\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.397\n&gt;&gt; And there's tools.\n\n351\n00:18:56.397 --> 00:18:58.760\n&gt;&gt; And the tools, right.\n&gt;&gt; And their skills, that's right.\n\n352\n00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.610\nA function is a group of people\nwith special skills and tools.\n\n353\n00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.482\nAnd ITIL's distilled it down into four\nseparate groups, the service desk,\n\n354\n00:19:05.482 --> 00:19:07.720\nall right, we'll start with that one.\n\n355\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.553\nThe service desk is the function, the\ngroup of people with special skills and\n\n356\n00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:13.260\ntools, right?\n\n357\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.850\nThey are the function\nthat faces end users.\n\n358\n00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.650\nThey are the interface between\nend users and the service.\n\n359\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:24.740\nAnd ITIL has a strong predisposition for\nsingle point of contact,\n\n360\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.815\nyou see it at the top here,\nthe top bullet, single point of contact.\n\n361\n00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:33.380\nITIL has a strong predisposition\nthat there's one place\n\n362\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.670\nusers go to get the help they need.\n\n363\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.852\nNow, that one place could be a phone call,\nit could be a chat room,\n\n364\n00:19:41.852 --> 00:19:46.036\nit could be an instant\nmessaging interface, right?\n\n365\n00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:49.480\nIt could be various places,\nit could be a self help tool, right?\n\n366\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:55.260\nSo the way you present the service\ndesk could have different interfaces,\n\n367\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.680\nbut at the end of the day, they know\nthey go to one place to do so, right?\n\n368\n00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.720\nIt's a group of people that's\ngonna be responsive, right,\n\n369\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.400\nthat's what the service desk is.\n\n370\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.487\nNow, once upon a time, ITIL introducing\nthe service desk was a novel idea,\n\n371\n00:20:09.487 --> 00:20:14.897\nI think it's probably more an accepted\nidea now, most organizations recognize\n\n372\n00:20:14.897 --> 00:20:19.849\nthe value of standing up a dedicated\nservice desk to handle the end users.\n\n373\n00:20:19.849 --> 00:20:22.970\nAll right, but\nonce upon a time in the evolution of ITIL,\n\n374\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.320\nthe idea of a centralized\nservice desk was novel.\n\n375\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.620\nSo that means users weren't sure who\nto call, so just do the compare and\n\n376\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.740\ncontrast there.\n\n377\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.360\nYou know John,\nhe does the server things, doesn't he?\n\n378\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.190\nJohnny, help me out with this, right?\n\n379\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.150\nSo they call Johnny for\nserver things, they call Mary for\n\n380\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.790\napplication things, right?\n\n381\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.360\nAnd they kind of get to know\nthe go to person, right?\n\n382\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.129\nAnd once they find out that Johnny is\njust simply sending it back to Ted,\n\n383\n00:20:48.129 --> 00:20:51.458\nthey'll bypass Johnny next time and\ngo to Ted, right?\n\n384\n00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:52.448\nSo the idea, again,\n\n385\n00:20:52.448 --> 00:20:56.106\nonce upon a time it was kind of novel to\nhave a central point of contact out here.\n\n386\n00:20:56.106 --> 00:21:00.650\nWell now, it's kind of accepted that you\nwant users coming through the front end to\n\n387\n00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:05.800\nstreamline the experience, to make it\nmore consistent, and also to speed it up,\n\n388\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.720\nto make it more effective, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.750\nTechnical management, I can kind\nof teach technical management and\n\n390\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.480\napplication management,\nthose two functions,\n\n391\n00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.350\nin a similar way,\nbecause they have so much in common.\n\n392\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.870\nWhat they have that's different is\nthey have different areas of knowledge\n\n393\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.280\nand tools.\n\n394\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.850\nTechnical management focuses on the back\nend things, infrastructure, if you will,\n\n395\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:35.760\nservers, databases, networks,\ncloud computing, mainframe computing,\n\n396\n00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:41.410\nthe nuts and bolts in the back end,\nthe supporting services, typically, right?\n\n397\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.310\nThey focus on that.\n\n398\n00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.130\nApplication management focuses\non the front end applications,\n\n399\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.450\nwhat are directly consumed by\nthe customers, right, HR applications,\n\n400\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.210\nfinancial management applications,\nlearning management, document management,\n\n401\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.240\nemail, Outlook applications.\n\n402\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.760\nSo you have the application\nmanagement people and\n\n403\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.010\nthe technical management people.\n\n404\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.480\nThey have different areas of specialty,\nbut what they have in common is\n\n405\n00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.250\nthey know everything there is to\nknow about their areas of specialty.\n\n406\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.510\nThey can show up at strategic meetings,\nand tactical meetings, design meetings.\n\n407\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.450\nThey can design tests and\nacceptance criteria, right?\n\n408\n00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.320\nThey can execute architectural plans.\n\n409\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.500\nThey can design capacity,\nthey can design availability.\n\n410\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.140\nThey can go deep and\nwide into their areas of specialty,\n\n411\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.876\nright, they just have different areas\nof speciality, applications and\n\n412\n00:22:31.876 --> 00:22:35.230\ninfrastructure, or technical management.\n\n413\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:40.740\nNow, distinguishing those two\nfunctions from operations management.\n\n414\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.620\nOperations management is\nthe day-to-day grind of IT,\n\n415\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:49.190\njust handling the executable things that\nhave to be executed every single day,\n\n416\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:55.090\nbackups and restores, printer maintenance,\nfacilities, wiring clauses, power outages.\n\n417\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.230\nAre the diesel generators full?\n\n418\n00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.330\nAll those types of things, right?\n\n419\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.320\nSo managing the day-to-day grind\nof IT is IT operations management.\n\n420\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.460\nNow, that's not to say\nthat any given person\n\n421\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.320\ncouldn't be a member of\nall three functions.\n\n422\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:15.340\nIn other words, I could have day-to-day\nresponsibilities, and show up at\n\n423\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.220\na technical meeting, or a tactical\nmeeting, or a strategic meeting, right?\n\n424\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.770\nSo again, not an organizational chart,\nper se, it's just a way to divide and\n\n425\n00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.166\nconquer the need for\nappropriate skills and people.\n\n426\n00:23:29.166 --> 00:23:34.230\nOperations management,\nday-to-day grind, technical and\n\n427\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.630\napplication management, deep dives, they\njust have different areas of specialty,\n\n428\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.800\nand, of course, the service desk\nthat interface with the end users.\n\n429\n00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.080\nAll right, that's probably a great\nplace to stop this particular episode.\n\n430\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.380\nWe've got a few more basic\nconcepts to pick up on.\n\n431\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.086\nWe got a few more minutes to go, but\nwe're reaching pretty close to the end of\n\n432\n00:23:53.086 --> 00:23:54.755\nthe time there, so\nwe'll take a break there.\n\n433\n00:23:54.755 --> 00:23:56.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well good.\n\n434\n00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.620\nWell, thank you Jerry,\nexcellent job as always.\n\n435\n00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.835\nOkay, this is Key Concepts of ITIL,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n436\n00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:05.692\nAnd I thank you for\nwatching, and thank you for\n\n437\n00:24:05.692 -->

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:16.560\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n8\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.740\nLots of great episodes in this.\n\n9\n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.315\nThis is part two though\nof key concepts of ITIL.\n\n10\n00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.580\nAnd bringing us all the information\nwe need is Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.990\nTerry, good to see you again, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here as always.\n\n13\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.480\n&gt;&gt; We're still here on the ITIL island.\n\n14\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.303\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n15\n00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:36.360\nwhat we're trying to do is try to\nformally build some sandcastles in MALC.\n\n16\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.020\n&gt;&gt; God, that's fun.\n\n17\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.694\n&gt;&gt; Build a perfect little sandcastle\nto get our little ducks in a row there.\n\n18\n00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:41.760\nSo yeah, as you mentioned,\n\n19\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.428\nwe're looking a little bit deeper\nat some key concepts of ITIL.\n\n20\n00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:50.890\nWe just got through in the previous\nepisode talking about the functions,\n\n21\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.480\nservice desk, IT operations management,\ntechnical management, and\n\n22\n00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.860\napplication management.\n\n23\n00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.590\nAnd all these different people\ndoing all kinds of things.\n\n24\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.530\nWhat can kinda help them out is\nif you define their roles and\n\n25\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.700\ntheir responsibilities appropriately.\n\n26\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.990\n&gt;&gt; And again it's people,\ntools, skills, right?\n\n27\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's what a function\nis, thank you for that, that's right.\n\n28\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.420\nA function is a group of people\nwith special skills or tools.\n\n29\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.253\nSo a very special definition of the word\nfunction is being played out here in ITIL.\n\n30\n00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:21.027\nSo we talked about those functions,\n\n31\n00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:23.325\na group of people with all\nkinds of things to do.\n\n32\n00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:25.845\nWe need to provide some order to that, and\n\n33\n00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:30.250\nITIL comes to the answer to that\nquestion through the use of RACI charts.\n\n34\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.560\nSo as you look at the graphic here,\na RACI Matrix, right?\n\n35\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.030\nWe've seen these before, we've seen them\nin virtually every one of the courses.\n\n36\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.920\nAnd the key rules of thumb here is that,\nyou only have one accountable for\n\n37\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.790\nany given activity.\n\n38\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.050\nIf you look at the graphic here,\nit's kinda small print there.\n\n39\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.060\nBut you've got Activity 1, you have\nthe director of service management\n\n40\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.340\naccountable and responsible for\nwhatever Activity 1 might be.\n\n41\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.760\nOf course, you'd be naming the specific\nactivities as you went down through here.\n\n42\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.720\nSo you see how it's a matrix.\n\n43\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.840\nOnly one accountable for\nany given activity.\n\n44\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.710\nBecause accountable people,\nthey make sure things get done.\n\n45\n00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.450\nThat's what accountable means here.\n\n46\n00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.460\nThey make sure it gets done.\n\n47\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.470\nThat doesn't mean they do anything.\n\n48\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.700\nIn fact, it's quite opposite.\n\n49\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.130\nAccountable people don't\nnecessarily write that test case,\n\n50\n00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.470\nor execute that script,\nright, or make that approval.\n\n51\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.532\nBut they are accountable to\nmake sure those steps are done.\n\n52\n00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:27.234\nSo because accountable people\ndon't actually do anything, right,\n\n53\n00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:31.326\nyou'd have to have, for any given\nactivity you'd have to have at least 1 R.\n\n54\n00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:34.765\nNow that doesn't mean that any\ngiven person, like an example here,\n\n55\n00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.565\nthe director of service management is\nboth accountable and responsible for\n\n56\n00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:40.160\nwhatever Activity 1 is.\n\n57\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.210\nThat's completely legal,\nright, totally legitimate.\n\n58\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.870\nOnly one accountable for\nany given activity.\n\n59\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.360\nAnd at least one responsible\n\n60\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.260\nbecause accountable people don't\nactually do anything, right?\n\n61\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.130\nThat's some rules of thumb.\n\n62\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.090\nSo if you're on an exam and\nthere's an exam environment and\n\n63\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.210\nyou're evaluating RACI charts,\nyou might be able to get rid of\n\n64\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.470\nthe zero answer right away by just\nlooking for the violation of those rules.\n\n65\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.530\nWithout diving into the details,\n\n66\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.320\nyou can just look at how many\nA's does any given line have?\n\n67\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.900\nAnd if one of the lines has more than\none A, that can't be the five answer.\n\n68\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.200\nSo just stop considering it.\n\n69\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.750\nIt's gonna be wrong.\n\n70\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.450\nSo sometimes just\nfollowing the rules without\n\n71\n00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.798\nthe details can help you out there, right?\n\n72\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.160\nThe way I remember this about accountable,\n\n73\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.600\nI learned it very specifically\nin first aid training.\n\n74\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.590\nIf you come up on a victim and\nyou're gonna be administering first aid,\n\n75\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.768\nyou don't just shout out,\nsomeone call 911.\n\n76\n00:03:33.768 --> 00:03:38.100\nYou point to someone and\nsay you, call 911.\n\n77\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.048\nSo you were accountable in\nassigning the responsibility, but\n\n78\n00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:43.335\nyou were very clear in your assignment,\nright?\n\n79\n00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:44.950\nYou gave it to a specific person.\n\n80\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.110\n&gt;&gt; Delegation of duties.\n\n81\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n82\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.180\nAnd it's transparent delegation,\nwe know who's on-point for this, right?\n\n83\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.900\nWe know who's supposed to be doing it.\n\n84\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.850\nIf I am the service level manager,\nand I look down the column, and\n\n85\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.910\nI see an R next to three\ndifferent activities.\n\n86\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.440\nAnd I know that everyone else is seeing\nan R next to those three activities.\n\n87\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.990\nI know those are the people expecting\nme to get those things done as well.\n\n88\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.500\nSo not only is it transparent, and\n\n89\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.390\na way to kind of divide\nthe activities among various people.\n\n90\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.120\nIt's in its transparency\nalso even motivating,\n\n91\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.566\neveryone knows what they're\nsupposed to be doing.\n\n92\n00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:21.910\nSo if we're meeting once a week or\n\n93\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.100\nonce a month on these activities and\nmy name is next to three different Rs,\n\n94\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.210\nI'm expected next month to\nreview on my particular actions.\n\n95\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.460\nI'm gonna be more reliable perhaps\nbecause we've made this transparent.\n\n96\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.321\nIt's also a way if you heavily dose\nsomeone up with a bunch of Rs,\n\n97\n00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.912\nonce you play this out, say wow,\nyou've got a lot of responsibility here.\n\n98\n00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:46.073\nShould we divide that up a little bit?\n\n99\n00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:51.310\nThat's also a way you can kinda\npass around the pain, if you will.\n\n100\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.090\nNow another key reminder\nhere about accountable and\n\n101\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.900\nresponsible as plays out in ITIL.\n\n102\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.750\nYou might be asked to discern\nthe accountability and\n\n103\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.220\nresponsibility of a process owner or\na process manager.\n\n104\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.270\nGenerally speaking, a process owner\nis accountable for things and\n\n105\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.370\na manager is responsible for things.\n\n106\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.980\nA manager is managing\nthe day to day things.\n\n107\n00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.310\nNow if the RACI chart is\ngetting into the details\n\n108\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.010\nof the difference between\na process owner and\n\n109\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.660\na process manager, then certainly process\nowners have responsibilities too.\n\n110\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.895\nBut if it's at a high level, you'll find\nthe process owner is probably gonna be\n\n111\n00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.540\nmore accountable than responsible.\n\n112\n00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.480\nJust a little tell-tale sign here.\n\n113\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.480\nSo dividing and\nconquering the various activities, and\n\n114\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.530\ntransparently displaying them through\nRACI Matrices is an ITIL best practice.\n\n115\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.341\nThe way this plays out\non exams is more often,\n\n116\n00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:50.350\nyou get to evaluate a RACI Matrix and\n\n117\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.384\ndetermine which one is the best\ndivision of effort, okay?\n\n118\n00:05:55.384 --> 00:05:57.260\nNow, Risk Management.\n\n119\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.120\nNow ITIL itself is not a formal\nrisk management discipline.\n\n120\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.360\nSo a deep dive into risk management\nthemes is not what this is about.\n\n121\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.560\nUnderstanding that risk is part of\ndelivering IT services, of course,\n\n122\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.420\nis important.\n\n123\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.280\nIf you wanna deliver\nhigh value IT services,\n\n124\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.030\nyou need to understand risk\nmanagement at a fundamental level.\n\n125\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.960\nYou really do.\n\n126\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.330\nIf you want a deeper dive into this, you\ncan certainly go to the institute there.\n\n127\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.980\nMoR is a registered trademark of\nthe same people that bring you ITIL.\n\n128\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.780\nThey have a discipline for\nformal risk management.\n\n129\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.811\nI wanna keep this simple.\n\n130\n00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:37.268\nRisk management is one\npart identification.\n\n131\n00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:39.200\nThat is the significant\npart of risk management.\n\n132\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.880\nAnd in the identification, you're\nalso assessing the likelihood of this\n\n133\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.260\nrisk happening, the probability and\nthe impact if it does.\n\n134\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.330\nSo it's one part identification which\nincludes the assessment of that risk,\n\n135\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.850\nhow likely is it happening and\nwhat's the impact if it does?\n\n136\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.690\nAnd it's also a second part mitigation,\nif you will.\n\n137\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.760\nSo you can't mitigate what\nyou haven't identified.\n\n138\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.240\nSo let me just make that even simpler.\n\n139\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.900\nHaving a registry of your risks,\nknowing them and\n\n140\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.512\ntransparently displaying them,\nthis is a risk, is very valuable.\n\n141\n00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:19.173\nIt's not eyes wide shut,\nit's eyes wide open, right?\n\n142\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.350\nYou are looking at the risks\ntransparently for all to see, and\n\n143\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.320\nsome of them are gonna be acceptable.\n\n144\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.410\nAnd even if they are really,\nreally risky and\n\n145\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.220\nthe impact is really high,\nyou might have to accept that risk.\n\n146\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.550\nBut at least you won't be blindsided if\nthat risk actually becomes reality, and\n\n147\n00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.970\nyou have to deal with it later on, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.250\nSo the part about risk management that's\nalmost as important as the mitigation\n\n149\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.530\nis the actual eyes-open identification.\n\n150\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.390\nYou know where you're going and\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n151\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:55.610\nIn the ITIL scheme of things, all 26\nprocesses have an effect of reducing risk.\n\n152\n00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.720\nBy this I mean at a very high level,\n\n153\n00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.150\nin the absence of an instant\nmanagement process, for instance.\n\n154\n00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.118\nYou're risking a defective way to interact\nwith end users when they call and\n\n155\n00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:05.992\nhave a problem.\n\n156\n00:08:05.992 --> 00:08:11.039\nIn the absence of availability management,\nyou're risking the chance of\n\n157\n00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:16.015\nhaving applications that fall over\nall the time, as an example, right?\n\n158\n00:08:16.015 --> 00:08:20.613\nSo all of the processes have at\nleast some aspect of risk management\n\n159\n00:08:20.613 --> 00:08:22.101\ninvolved with them.\n\n160\n00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.778\nBut among all the processes,\n\n161\n00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:27.410\nthere are two processes that\ndirectly affect risk management.\n\n162\n00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.700\nThey have risk management\nas a very specific focus.\n\n163\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.830\nThat's continuity management and\nsecurity management.\n\n164\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.438\nBoth of those processes happen to play\nin heavily with that kind of focus,\n\n165\n00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:38.029\nall right?\n\n166\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.801\nNow Knowledge Management.\n\n167\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.996\nHaving a culture of sharing\nknowledge is important,\n\n168\n00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:53.540\nand I have worked in organizations\nof various sizes and\n\n169\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.920\nvarious complexities over\nmy years of experience.\n\n170\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.060\nSome were really good and had a really\ngood culture of sharing knowledge.\n\n171\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.050\nAnd I've worked in other ones\nwhere knowledge was the power and\n\n172\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.360\nthe politics of things.\n\n173\n00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.150\nI'm not gonna tell you,\nI know this, you don't, right?\n\n174\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.759\nI've also worked in that kind of culture.\n\n175\n00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:16.165\nObviously, I think it's obviously, the one\nthat shares knowledge more readily,\n\n176\n00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:19.964\nis gonna be more successful than\nthe one that holds it too close, right?\n\n177\n00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:23.382\nGive you an example, and again,\nthis is not an ITIL recommendation, but\n\n178\n00:09:23.382 --> 00:09:26.527\nit is consulting with an organization\nthat actually had a goal, and\n\n179\n00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:29.581\nI'm not saying this is one you\nshould aspire to, I'm not at all.\n\n180\n00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:35.123\nBut they had a goal that 100% of\nthe calls to their service desk,\n\n181\n00:09:35.123 --> 00:09:39.120\n100% would be resolved\nby the service desk.\n\n182\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.600\nNow again, I am not saying\nthat is a worthy aspiration,\n\n183\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.610\nI am not suggesting that ITIL\nis not suggesting that either.\n\n184\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.068\nBut I want you to consider that goal.\n\n185\n00:09:47.068 --> 00:09:52.660\n100% of calls to the service desk\nare resolved by the service desk.\n\n186\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.684\nWhat does that mean for knowledge sharing?\n\n187\n00:09:57.684 --> 00:10:02.963\nWhose behavior, regarding knowledge\nmanagement, needs to change?\n\n188\n00:10:02.963 --> 00:10:06.020\nWell, certainly the service\ndesk needs to get smarter.\n\n189\n00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.630\nTheir behavior's gonna change.\n\n190\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.160\nMaybe your job descriptions,\n\n191\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.230\nmaybe HR has to rework the job\ndescription in such a way,\n\n192\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.370\nto attract the type of talent that's gonna\nbe at the front end of these things.\n\n193\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.200\nBut what about the backend,\nyour second and third level support?\n\n194\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.860\nHow is their behavior changing to enable\n\n195\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.370\nsuch a worthy goal or\nunworthy goal for that matter, right?\n\n196\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.690\nSo again, knowledge sharing is what\nthat particular goal had in mind, right?\n\n197\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.860\nSo maybe it was aspirational.\n\n198\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.180\nMaybe they'll never get there.\n\n199\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.130\nBut they were trying to\nmotivate an organization toward\n\n200\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.260\ngiving up knowledge and making it\nmore readily accessible to others.\n\n201\n00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.620\nAgain, this is an example of an\nenvironment that could be highly sharing,\n\n202\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.040\nversus one that kind of\nkeeps things closer.\n\n203\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.130\nKnowledge management, ultimately-\n&gt;&gt; Good example, Terry.\n\n204\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n205\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Good, so another example, or really\nwhat knowledge management is trying to do,\n\n206\n00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:05.340\nis move data, raw data toward wisdom and\nthe steps in between, right?\n\n207\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.047\nSo a knowledge management system,\nas it will,\n\n208\n00:11:08.047 --> 00:11:11.498\nI think if you look up the word\nsystem in a more generic sense,\n\n209\n00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:15.784\nyou'll find lots of things moving\ntogether toward a common goal, right?\n\n210\n00:11:15.784 --> 00:11:20.040\nI think IT, we often think of system\nas something that you go out and buy.\n\n211\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.610\nI'm gonna go buy a configuration\nmanagement system.\n\n212\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.741\nI wanna configure it and it's gonna work\nwell for configuration management, right?\n\n213\n00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:28.130\nYou go out and\nbuy something that helps you do it.\n\n214\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.911\nWhen you consider\nService Knowledge Management System,\n\n215\n00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:34.610\nI think you're considering something\nthat's more classic in definition.\n\n216\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.430\nA lot of things working\ntogether toward a common goal.\n\n217\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.280\nAnd the common goal is to\ntransform data into information,\n\n218\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.130\ninformation into knowledge,\nand knowledge into wisdom,\n\n219\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.720\ngraphically shown here\nthis transformation.\n\n220\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.324\nSo the closer you get to wisdom, now\neventually systems aren't gonna play out.\n\n221\n00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:54.999\nPeople are gonna have to be involved.\n\n222\n00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:58.257\nIt's a human endeavor to\nconvert knowledge into wisdom.\n\n223\n00:11:58.257 --> 00:12:00.060\nIt's not in computer IT.\n\n224\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.666\nI mean, as close as we get to artificial\nintelligence, we still are involving\n\n225\n00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:07.069\nhumans quite a bit in this transformation\nbetween knowledge and wisdom.\n\n226\n00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:09.710\n&gt;&gt; And wisdom is knowledge in action, yes?\n\n227\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.570\n&gt;&gt; Good call, absolutely, good call.\n\n228\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.030\nI like that,\nI'm gonna quote you on that one.\n\n229\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.503\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; That's not copyrighted or anything?\n\n230\n00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:16.082\n&gt;&gt; I think I got it from\na guy named Solomon.\n\n231\n00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:16.995\nI don't know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:12:16.995 --> 00:12:18.731\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Solomon maybe said that,\n\n233\n00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:20.346\nall right, wise man as he was.\n\n234\n00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:22.080\nIt is wisdom in action.\n\n235\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.174\nAbsolutely, it's making informed decisions\nbased on all the knowledge you have, and\n\n236\n00:12:26.174 --> 00:12:27.230\nit's cyclical too.\n\n237\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.420\nAnd it's even a spiral, if you will,\nyou get better at this, right?\n\n238\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.065\nSo transforming data and\n\n239\n00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:37.167\ninformation to knowledge into wisdom\nis a big part of knowledge management.\n\n240\n00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:41.879\nNow again, I'm gonna look at this\nrather big little example here.\n\n241\n00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:44.321\nBig, little,\n[LAUGH] this little example of-\n\n242\n00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:44.904\n&gt;&gt; Little big books.\n\n243\n00:12:44.904 --> 00:12:45.719\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little big books.\n\n244\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.690\nA Service Knowledge Management System\nwould be hard to put on a single page.\n\n245\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:57.635\nImagine the data required, all the data\nyou've collected in the IT organization.\n\n246\n00:12:57.635 --> 00:13:02.110\nImagine all the documents that are there\nwith information inside them, right?\n\n247\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.926\nAnd then imagine presenting that\ninformation in a way that imparts\n\n248\n00:13:06.926 --> 00:13:07.875\nknowledge.\n\n249\n00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:10.574\nI mean, this is not a trivial matter,\nright, and\n\n250\n00:13:10.574 --> 00:13:13.613\nthere's not gonna be a picture\nthat does justice to it.\n\n251\n00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:16.182\nIf you go to the example here,\nyou have a CMDB and\n\n252\n00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:18.635\nperhaps multiple of them\nhere in the bottom.\n\n253\n00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:20.918\nLet me get my pointer here.\n\n254\n00:13:22.422 --> 00:13:26.420\nYou got the CMDB,\nconfiguration management database.\n\n255\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.490\nYou might have multiples of those,\nand they form a single CMS\n\n256\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.290\nacross the enterprise,\nconfiguration management system.\n\n257\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:38.611\nI often describe the CMS as a big\nboat with lots of containers on it,\n\n258\n00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:42.231\nand the containers being the CMDBs, right?\n\n259\n00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:45.910\nWell, if that analogy were to hold forth,\nif a CMS is a boat,\n\n260\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.672\nand the CMDBs are the multiple containers\non that one single boat, then SKMS,\n\n261\n00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:54.085\nthe Service Knowledge Management System\nis the ocean.\n\n262\n00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:58.298\nCuz there's so many other things out\nthere, there's other boats of information,\n\n263\n00:13:58.298 --> 00:13:59.855\nthere's other data sources.\n\n264\n00:13:59.855 --> 00:14:04.005\nYou have HR data, you have performance\ndata, you have financial data,\n\n265\n00:14:04.005 --> 00:14:07.611\nyou have change data,\nyou have incident data, problem data,\n\n266\n00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:11.782\navailability management plans,\nyou have capacity management plans.\n\n267\n00:14:11.782 --> 00:14:15.670\nSo it's a flood, I mean,\nan ocean of information.\n\n268\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.800\nKnowledge management as a system,\nagain, in a classic sense,\n\n269\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.640\na lot of different things working together\nis a tough boat to row if you will.\n\n270\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.950\nIt's a tough one, right,\nalso very important.\n\n271\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.200\nSo a big part of strategizing for\n\n272\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.670\nmanaging across a life cycle\nis enabling knowledge sharing.\n\n273\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.220\nEnabling the presentation of\ninformation for more rapid and\n\n274\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.200\naccurate decision making, wisdom.\n\n275\n00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.030\nSo as you're looking at\nthe landscape of service management,\n\n276\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.030\nyou are necessarily looking at\nthe landscape of knowledge.\n\n277\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.950\nAnd how can you spread it,\nand more effectively\n\n278\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.810\nliberate it from the data and\ninformation that underlies it.\n\n279\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.520\nSo to do that,\n\n280\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.380\nyou're really trying to come up with\na knowledge management strategy.\n\n281\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.640\nWhat data's important to us,\nwhat information's important to us?\n\n282\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.850\nHow perishable is it,\nhow long do we have to hang on to it?\n\n283\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.570\nWho are the appropriate audiences?\n\n284\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.230\nAre we talking about\ntraining vehicles here?\n\n285\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.307\nAre we talking about\npresentation vehicles?\n\n286\n00:15:19.307 --> 00:15:20.779\nAll of the above.\n\n287\n00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:25.335\nThere's not one size fits all in any\ngiven organization, that's for sure.\n\n288\n00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:26.665\nNot a trivial matter,\n\n289\n00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:31.385\nsomething definitely worth considering\nat a holistic strategic view.\n\n290\n00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:36.024\nHow are we managing our data assets\nis really what this comes down to?\n\n291\n00:15:36.024 --> 00:15:39.100\nAnd of course, that could play\nout the knowledge transfer.\n\n292\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.030\nKnowledge transfer dealing with training.\n\n293\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.440\nGo take a course, right?\n\n294\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.630\nA known error database is knowledge\ntransfer from the problem management team\n\n295\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.130\nto the incident management team.\n\n296\n00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.172\nYou might remember the known error\ndatabase from service operations.\n\n297\n00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:53.385\nWe'll have another look at\nthat a little bit later on.\n\n298\n00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:58.141\nBut again service knowledge being\ntransferred to other people could be\n\n299\n00:15:58.141 --> 00:15:59.973\nthrough formal training.\n\n300\n00:15:59.973 --> 00:16:03.010\nIt could be through formal vehicles.\n\n301\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.570\nWe go to this website for that,\nwe go to that website for\n\n302\n00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.230\nthis, those types of things.\n\n303\n00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.522\nA map of where information is could be\nan important deliverable of the service\n\n304\n00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:12.782\nknowledge strategy.\n\n305\n00:16:14.888 --> 00:16:18.180\nOf course, it feeds into CSI.\n\n306\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.410\nIf you think about how good a service is\nperforming or how poorly a service is\n\n307\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:29.850\nperforming, underneath that performance\nassessment are customer opinions,\n\n308\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.400\nperhaps, survey results, process results.\n\n309\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.510\nHow are your processes performing?\n\n310\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.033\nThat's data,\nthat's knowledge you're gaining.\n\n311\n00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:43.776\nAn effective knowledge management\nregime will feed your continual service\n\n312\n00:16:43.776 --> 00:16:45.193\nimprovement regime.\n\n313\n00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:47.443\nYou won't be moving forward blindly.\n\n314\n00:16:47.443 --> 00:16:51.556\nYou'll be moving forward with good data,\ngood information and good knowledge so\n\n315\n00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:55.150\nthat you can make a wise decision\non what should be improved.\n\n316\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.540\nSo let me sum this whole thing up\nregarding knowledge management and CSI.\n\n317\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:05.300\nIf you, at a strategic level, consider\nIT service management capabilities\n\n318\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.170\nas a strategic asset, and of course,\nthat's what ITIL invites you to do.\n\n319\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.690\nIT service management becomes a strategic\nasset, managing across a life cycle.\n\n320\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.890\nThis particular course material,\nthe exam and back at the office\n\n321\n00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.330\nis inviting you to look at IT service\nmanagement as a strategic asset.\n\n322\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.700\nThe reason why you wanna\nconsider it a strategic asset is\n\n323\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.280\nbecause you want to improve your position\nas it relates to your customers.\n\n324\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.710\nYou wanna become that strategic\nasset that they rely on to\n\n325\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:38.990\nachieve their business outcomes.\n\n326\n00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.940\nMapping where you are now\n\n327\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.329\nto where you wanna be is mapping\nan improvement strategy.\n\n328\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.000\nKnowledge management is\ngonna be key to that.\n\n329\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.360\nThat's that.\n\n330\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.020\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n331\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Once again, and\n\n332\n00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:59.460\nthis was key concepts of ITIL part two,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n333\n00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.470\nLots of episodes in this series,\nwatch them all.\n\n334\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.160\nThank you, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n335\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.480\nRemember, a good ITPro is always learning.\n\n336\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.460\nI'm Zach

management.\n\n12\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.240\nThe topic is key to understanding\nthe strategic approach to\n\n13\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.920\nimplementing ITIL or adopting ITIL across\nthe organization as a strategic asset,\n\n14\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.930\nis gonna have thorough communication\nwith all your stakeholders.\n\n15\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.600\nSo that's the theme and\nthe message, communication and\n\n16\n00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.140\nstakeholders are both important.\n\n17\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.780\nSo let's dive in here a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.650\nAs you might guess,\n\n19\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.450\none of the primary processes\nassociated with communications is BRM.\n\n20\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.590\nSo as we look at the slides here We\nare just going through several slides here\n\n21\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.740\nthat talks about how BRM, Business\nRelationship Management, is alive and\n\n22\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.100\nwell throughout each\nstage of the life cycle.\n\n23\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.030\nAgain, we've touched on this before, in\nprevious intermediate classes perhaps, but\n\n24\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.580\nthe reinforcement here is how you take\n\n25\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.020\na strategic view at communication\nin stakeholder management.\n\n26\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.980\nAnd certainly BRM is involved at the\nearliest stage of the strategic review.\n\n27\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.940\nIt's in the service strategy where you\nare discerning customers needs and\n\n28\n00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.400\ncustomer requirements, and\nyou're trying to sell them, perhaps.\n\n29\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.210\nThis marketing mindset is often going to\nbe delivered through the eyes of BRM if\n\n30\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.960\nyou will.\n\n31\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.710\nWhile BRM is born in server's strategy,\nit's alive and well throughout the stages.\n\n32\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.140\nThis important stage in service strategy\nis ascertaining just what is the business\n\n33\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.220\ntrying to accomplish, and what IT services\ncan be brought to bear to help them\n\n34\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.550\nreach those business outcomes, right.\n\n35\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.330\nSo then moving forward then from\nstrategy onto service design,\n\n36\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.080\nthe next stage of the life cycle.\n\n37\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.270\nBRM is also alive there trying to\n\n38\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.730\nbridge the gap between the high\nlevel requirements and\n\n39\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.700\nthe service level requirements that\nmust be designed into the service.\n\n40\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.990\nPerhaps, we need to schedule\nwhat success looks like,\n\n41\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.720\nor ascertain what success looks like.\n\n42\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.880\nWhat measurements are going to be\nbrought to bear that show the success of\n\n43\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.706\nthe service?\n\n44\n00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:33.400\nBRM can be there as the liason between\nthese IT people and the business people,\n\n45\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.437\ntrying to discern just what we should be\nmeasuring, how we should look at success,\n\n46\n00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:44.120\nwhat are the service acceptance\ncriteria actually going to be.\n\n47\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.340\nSo BRM is going to help you there.\n\n48\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.620\nAnd then moving in to transition,\nBRM is alive and\n\n49\n00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.330\nwell because it's in service\ntransition that we're validating,\n\n50\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.050\nthat we're satisfying\nthe service acceptance criteria.\n\n51\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.650\nWhatever we decided to measure,\nwhatever we determined was going to, what\n\n52\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.920\nsuccess was going to look like is going to\nbe validated here in service transition.\n\n53\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.090\nSo BRM is there if things go awry,\n\n54\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.210\nBRM is there if things are going well,\nBRM is there, right?\n\n55\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.990\nNow its just,\nthe way to look at this is as a process,\n\n56\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.380\nbusiness relationship management is\non-going throughout all the stages.\n\n57\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.420\nI don't want you to necessarily\nthink of this as a person,\n\n58\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.700\nthat there is a person necessarily\nresponsible all the way through here.\n\n59\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.500\nThat's not necessarily the way to look\nat how the process is playing out.\n\n60\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.830\nBut then again it could be a given person,\nthis kinda care and\n\n61\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.170\nfeeding this relationship\nall the way through, right.\n\n62\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.070\nCertainly when you get into operations,\nas you get into service of operations,\n\n63\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.300\nyou gonna be concerned about\nthe customer satisfaction.\n\n64\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.700\nSo way back up in strategy\nyou discern the requirements.\n\n65\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.600\nYou, through design make sure that service\nacceptance criteria was acceptable to both\n\n66\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600\nsides, IT and the customer.\n\n67\n00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.300\nIn service transition, you verify, or\nvalidate, that acceptance criteria's been\n\n68\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.680\nmet, but actually the validation is\ngoing to be coming in operations, right.\n\n69\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.240\nIt's not until you get\nthe service operation\n\n70\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.790\nthat you actually deliver\nthe value that's intended.\n\n71\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.710\nSo, if you promised that this new IT\nservice was going to help the customer\n\n72\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.160\nsell more widgets, or find more oil,\nor find it more quickly.\n\n73\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.210\nWhatever your service was promising,\nis that being delivered?\n\n74\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.110\nThat won't be delivered until\nthe service is actually operational, so\n\n75\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.740\nBRM is right there.\n\n76\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.510\nSo if sales remain stagnant, and\noil takes just as long to find as before,\n\n77\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.830\nyou're probably going to hear\nfrom the customers a little bit.\n\n78\n00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.560\nBRM's gonna be there with\ntheir ears open a little bit.\n\n79\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.730\nHow's it going?\n\n80\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.890\nAre we helping you sell more widgets or\nfind more oil?\n\n81\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.160\nBRM is gonna be there with that\nrelationship ongoing through operations.\n\n82\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.010\nOf course, then BRM can help\nfeed CSI moving forward as well.\n\n83\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.330\nSo as we talk about communications then,\nBRM as a process is alive and well.\n\n84\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.320\nWhat about the person called\nthe business relationship manager?\n\n85\n00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.610\nHow are they involved as a person, right?\n\n86\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.180\nWell they're certainly going\nto help define the process and\n\n87\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.580\nhow it's rolled out.\n\n88\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.030\nNow that doesn't mean they're necessarily\nshow up at every single survey event or\n\n89\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.350\ncustomer interaction.\n\n90\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.330\nIn fact, it's probably better to look\nat business relationship manager\n\n91\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.320\nas an enabling role,\none that allows other people to\n\n92\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.460\nsucceed with their relationships\nwith the customers, right?\n\n93\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.360\nSo make sure that the right\nskill sets are involved,\n\n94\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.285\nthat you understand the customers'\ngoals and the desired outcomes,\n\n95\n00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:35.840\nis really what business\nrelationship manager is doing here.\n\n96\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.440\nThey're cracking the whip, maybe,\n\n97\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.410\nmotivating people in the right direction,\nor just beating the drum of success,\n\n98\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.160\nsaying yep we're doing well, keeping\npeople marching in the right direction.\n\n99\n00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:49.956\nHowever way you wanna look at this\nbusiness relationship manager,\n\n100\n00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:54.637\nin effect what they're doing is\nenabling the success of those people\n\n101\n00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:57.236\nthat do interact with the customers.\n\n102\n00:05:57.236 --> 00:06:00.290\nOkay, to do so\nyou need to understand your stakeholders.\n\n103\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.090\nSo what we've gone from communication, the\nnature of building appropriate mechanism,\n\n104\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.110\nsuch as BRM, to govern the overarching\nscope of engagement with the customer.\n\n105\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.250\nWho are your stakeholders,\nnot just the customer?\n\n106\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.180\nRemember the four stakeholder groups\nare the customer, the user the suppliers,\n\n107\n00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.620\nand the service provider themselves, they\nall need to be communicated with, right?\n\n108\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.820\nSo come up with\nan appropriate strategy for\n\n109\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.860\nunderstanding who your stakeholders are,\nby name, perhaps, by role, and\n\n110\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.930\nby involvement in your activities.\n\n111\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.410\nSo, fast forward a little bit here,\nstakeholder management.\n\n112\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.570\nHere's just a stakeholder map,\n\n113\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.720\nnow let me kind of orient you to\nthe value of this map at first.\n\n114\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:51.000\nWhat you see across the top are the major\nactivities that are under consideration.\n\n115\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.450\nLet me get my laser pointer here, right.\n\n116\n00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.960\nSo strategic direction,\nfinancial activities, operational changes,\n\n117\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.300\ninterface with customers,\npublic safety, competitive position, so\n\n118\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.970\nthese are considerations,\nright, major considerations.\n\n119\n00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.530\nAnd then along the left column her\nwe've got the various stakeholders.\n\n120\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.615\nWe've got business partners,\nproject teams,\n\n121\n00:07:16.615 --> 00:07:21.496\ncustomers, the press and\nmedia, trade unions, staff,\n\n122\n00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:27.330\nregulatory bodies, these are providing\ngrist for the millifuel.\n\n123\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.670\nWhen we're designing IT services,\n\n124\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.550\nthese are the stakeholders\nthat have a stake in it.\n\n125\n00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.776\nAgain, so now we've broken down those four\nmajor ones into some sub-texts there,\n\n126\n00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:37.400\nif you will.\n\n127\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.505\nSo, what you're doing on this stakeholder\nmap is finding where they meet.\n\n128\n00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:47.758\nSo for instance, your business partners,\nthe ones that you strategically\n\n129\n00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:53.761\ninteract with, as opposed to customers,\nthe one that eventually buy your services.\n\n130\n00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.736\nYour business partners are typically,\nif you're an internal provider,\n\n131\n00:07:57.736 --> 00:08:01.532\nthey're the executives in the other\nAreas or other functional areas.\n\n132\n00:08:01.532 --> 00:08:05.734\nMaybe the CEO and the governance team,\nthe IT governance board and\n\n133\n00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:09.277\nall of the business unit heads,\nthe executives there.\n\n134\n00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:11.900\nSo what they be interested in, right?\n\n135\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.720\nWould they have an interest in strategic\ndirection, financial directions?\n\n136\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.880\nRight, are they gonna get that\nheavily involved in operation changes?\n\n137\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.843\nNot so much.\n\n138\n00:08:20.843 --> 00:08:23.959\nThey expect things to happen and\nthey get things moving, but\n\n139\n00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:26.670\nthey're not involved in that piece.\n\n140\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.600\nAre they going to be\ninterfacing with customers?\n\n141\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.000\nAbsolutely, they're helping driving\nthat customer relationship as well.\n\n142\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.530\nAnd then, are they concerned\nabout a competitive position?\n\n143\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.910\nNow, in this idea of a competitive\nposition, certainly if you're selling your\n\n144\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:44.190\nservices to external customers,\nthose external customers have options.\n\n145\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.460\nMaybe they can get your\nservices from somewhere else.\n\n146\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.810\nSo it could be in that context,\n\n147\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.420\nwhere your competitive position\nis being affected, right?\n\n148\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.990\nHow can IT help the business\nbe more successful,\n\n149\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.700\ncompetitively is also in play here.\n\n150\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.640\nSo it's not just competition for IT,\nit's the competition of the business and\n\n151\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.460\nhow is IT involved in helping\nthe business be more competitive, right?\n\n152\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.620\nIf you're an oil company, and\n\n153\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.940\nyou're helping your company find oil more\nquickly, therefore saving some money,\n\n154\n00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:18.090\nthen obviously you could be at a better\ncompetitive position as compared to\n\n155\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.120\nthose other people out there trying to\ndiscover oil, as an example, right?\n\n156\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.360\nSo again, not to belabor this too much,\n\n157\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.120\ncoming up with just understanding\nthe value of a stakeholder map.\n\n158\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.980\nWhat might they be interested in?\n\n159\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:34.110\nSo, what you might find\non an exam environment is\n\n160\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.810\nthe need to create a stakeholder map.\n\n161\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.170\nRight, so\nthe way the scenario plays out is,\n\n162\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.430\nyou don't know who's your stakeholders\nare, so what activity could you do?\n\n163\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.630\nCome up with a stakeholder map, name them.\n\n164\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.020\nAnd come up with the activities\nthey could be involved in.\n\n165\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.290\nThat's really what this is trying to do.\n\n166\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.220\nAnother academic approach could be,\nthat you get to look at a stakeholder map.\n\n167\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.237\nAnd, more likely it's one of these,\nwhere you're trying to move the particular\n\n168\n00:10:00.237 --> 00:10:05.197\nstakeholder toward a different direction,\nthrough your communication plan.\n\n169\n00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:09.005\nHow you wanna manage a stakeholder, how\nyou wanna get the horse to the water and\n\n170\n00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:12.790\nthen make them drink it is what\nwe're talking about here, right?\n\n171\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.860\nSo in this case, if you look at this\nstakeholder, it shows the current\n\n172\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.760\nlocation, where they are now, and\nwhere you're trying to move them to.\n\n173\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.410\nSo the circle is the starting point, and\n\n174\n00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.790\nthrough your stakeholder management\nregime, which will include a big dose of\n\n175\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:32.430\ncommunication, you're trying to move\nthem toward a different location.\n\n176\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.740\nSo just as an example,\nyou have a departing\n\n177\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.780\ndirector of a customer, right,\ndeparting director of customers.\n\n178\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.970\nSo the director of your customer\nis gonna be leaving, right.\n\n179\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.890\nSo they once were at helping you make\nit happen to, well, just go away and\n\n180\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.490\ndon't make any noise, right?\n\n181\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.430\nGo make them, so they're not resisting.\n\n182\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.590\nSo they're on their way out anyway.\n\n183\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.150\nSo you're not key over\nyour communication and\n\n184\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.980\nmanagement plan,\nstakeholder management plan.\n\n185\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.497\nYou're not really keying to\nconvince them of anything,\n\n186\n00:11:07.497 --> 00:11:11.445\nother than don't disrupt what\nwe're trying to get done.\n\n187\n00:11:11.445 --> 00:11:15.675\nBe an advocate, maybe, but\nplease don't be a resistor, right.\n\n188\n00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.355\nIf you look at the next one, the chair\nof the board of the service provider.\n\n189\n00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:26.260\nYou need to get them from no resistance\nto helping you make it happen, right?\n\n190\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.820\nGet their buy in, get their investment,\n\n191\n00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.130\nperhaps in giving up funds for whatever\ndirection you're going in, and certainly,\n\n192\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.450\narticulating their support\nthrough other means, right.\n\n193\n00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.947\nAs an example, I'll give you\nan example of one where they are there,\n\n194\n00:11:40.947 --> 00:11:44.225\nyou gotta keep them there,\nwhich is a pretty cute little trick.\n\n195\n00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:45.960\nYou put the o and the x in the same place.\n\n196\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.618\nYou don't wanna lose them, right.\n\n197\n00:11:47.618 --> 00:11:50.730\nSo you are the new director\nof the service provider.\n\n198\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.681\nSo the new one is coming on board,\n\n199\n00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:56.280\nyou wanna make sure they\nare there to make it happen.\n\n200\n00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.930\nJust as you'd want the executives up\nhere to help you make it happen, right?\n\n201\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.740\nAnd also, be right there with\nyou all the time, right.\n\n202\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.310\nA customer who doesn't care to someone\nthat doesn't resist you, right.\n\n203\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.420\nSo that's an interesting migration too.\n\n204\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.051\nIt's not that, so first of all,\nthey're just unaware.\n\n205\n00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:21.196\nYou're trying to move the customer to say,\njust wait here it comes,\n\n206\n00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:22.830\nyou're gonna love it, right?\n\n207\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.210\nSo they're not resisting you.\n\n208\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.440\nAs you move down the stream,\n\n209\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.350\nyou're gonna have to be talking\nabout the value proposition.\n\n210\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.587\nWhy should they care about this IT\nservice, etc., okay, as an example.\n\n211\n00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:37.874\nSo, looking at managing\nthe movement of a given\n\n212\n00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:42.493\nstakeholder is a part of\nstakeholder management.\n\n213\n00:12:42.493 --> 00:12:45.690\nOperationally speaking,\nthis is not that hard or cumbersome.\n\n214\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.560\nYou could come up with the people,\nright, maybe you name them.\n\n215\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.390\nRight, maybe you give them names and\npeople know them by names.\n\n216\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.370\nMaybe you give them titles,\nlike in this case, you give them roles.\n\n217\n00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.550\nAll that is very appropriate, right.\n\n218\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.370\nEither way is appropriate, but you need\nto identify who the stakeholders are, and\n\n219\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.020\nwhat is your goal in managing them?\n\n220\n00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.860\nWhere are you moving them to,\n\n221\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.100\nis a very interesting trick\nin stakeholder management.\n\n222\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.120\nAnd again, not very cumbersome.\n\n223\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.403\nHaving a brainstorm session\nwith the project team or\n\n224\n00:13:14.403 --> 00:13:17.918\nthe motivators, the change initiators.\n\n225\n00:13:17.918 --> 00:13:21.635\nHaving a good discussion, brainstorming\nsession with them to highlight this\n\n226\n00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:25.409\nstakeholder map and highlight the movement\non their commitment levels is not,\n\n227\n00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:29.080\nthat doesn't mean to be overwrought,\nyou don't have to over think this.\n\n228\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.465\nKeep it simple.\n\n229\n00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:34.511\nAnd academically speaking on the exam,\njust focus in on the absence of, or\n\n230\n00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:37.230\npresence of, the stakeholder map itself.\n\n231\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.005\n&gt;&gt; So once again,\nthe four is customer, user, supplier,\n\n232\n00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:42.505\nand service provider, right?\n\n233\n00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:43.035\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n234\n00:13:43.035 --> 00:13:45.075\n&gt;&gt; That's the four large\nstakeholder groups.\n\n235\n00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.125\nWhen you get into stakeholder management,\n\n236\n00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:49.825\nyou're dividing those things down\nin little sub-text a little bit.\n\n237\n00:13:49.825 --> 00:13:51.456\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right, excellent.\n\n238\n00:13:52.557 --> 00:13:54.567\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so.\n\n239\n00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:55.300\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n240\n00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, moving on here.\n\n241\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.340\nDefining services.\n\n242\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.190\nCertainly this happens\nat the strategic level.\n\n243\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:04.580\nService strategy is the stage of\nthe life cycle, where you define,\n\n244\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.080\nwhat services you wanna bring to life,\nwhat services currently exist, and\n\n245\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.670\nactually what services\nmight need to be retired.\n\n246\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.670\nYou might recall that service\nportfolio management is the process\n\n247\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.130\nthat manages that life cycle of a service,\nfrom identifying an idea\n\n248\n00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:23.855\nof consideration of a service to make\na decision to bring it to life, so\n\n249\n00:14:23.855 --> 00:14:26.105\nit's an operational one\nin service catalog.\n\n250\n00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:28.745\nSo you got your pipeline,\nyou got your catalog, and normally,\n\n251\n00:14:28.745 --> 00:14:30.505\nyou retire these services.\n\n252\n00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:35.670\nSo service strategy is the stage\nthat governs that activity,\n\n253\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.590\nservice portfolio management,\n\n254\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.380\nis the process that manages the ongoing\nconsideration of these services, right.\n\n255\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.600\nAll right, perfect.\n\n256\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.172\nAn example of a service model,\nas you go to the full screen here,\n\n257\n00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:54.323\nyou can kinda see that it almost\nlooks like a process flow,\n\n258\n00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:56.630\nif you will, for-\n&gt;&gt; Like a flow chart.\n\n259\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Almost like a flow chart.\n\n260\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.460\nBut really what this is,\nis describing the various elements\n\n261\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.530\nof delivering an end to end service,\nand what has to be put in play.\n\n262\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.050\nNow, again it kinda looks like the way\nyou would design an application, almost.\n\n263\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.900\nAnd application design and service design\nare not that far from each other, right.\n\n264\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.810\nBut, along the paths of things that must\nbe delivered, you will have options for\n\n265\n00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.870\nservices to be in play.\n\n266\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.910\nSo, describing the model in business\nterms, and that's what this one does.\n\n267\n00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:29.560\nIf you look at part one, which is in\nthe upper right here, is shopping.\n\n268\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.640\nSo, going and finding things,\n\n269\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.690\nshopping card eventually becomes\npart of that recommendations, etc.\n\n270\n00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:42.740\nSo just imagine the workflow at\na typical amazon.com type interface,\n\n271\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.660\nwhere you go in, you find the product\nyou wanna get, through the catalog,\n\n272\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.230\nthe browsing, and that sort of stuff.\n\n273\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.912\nEventually, you order something, so\nthere is interface for shipping.\n\n274\n00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:52.586\nRight, so\nit looks like an application flow,\n\n275\n00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:55.203\nthis is also showing\nthe value proposition.\n\n276\n00:15:55.203 --> 00:15:59.413\nOf the service model, the various things\nthat make this service work is the ability\n\n277\n00:15:59.413 --> 00:16:01.997\nto shop for things,\nthe ability to pay for things,\n\n278\n00:16:01.997 --> 00:16:05.650\nthe ability to have them shipped\nto the appropriate address.\n\n279\n00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.760\nAnd all those provide interfaces\nwith other systems of identity,\n\n280\n00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.190\nother systems of fulfillment,\nother systems of discovery.\n\n281\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.980\nSo the systems in the back end\nare doing what they do but\n\n282\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.940\nin the front end, you have a model of\nservices toward business outcomes.\n\n283\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.190\nIf I were to replace this one with\nyou know, find oil, extract oil,\n\n284\n00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:30.930\ndistribute oil.\n\n285\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.213\nRefine oil, distribute refined oil,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n286\n00:16:35.213 --> 00:16:36.884\never how many different things.\n\n287\n00:16:36.884 --> 00:16:40.718\nYou have different place holders\nat the top, here, and potentially\n\n288\n00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:44.900\ndifferent IT services for filling\nthose different parts of the business.\n\n289\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.930\nSo think of a service model as a way that\nyou collect various groups of services.\n\n290\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.640\nThey may have shared components.\n\n291\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.370\nThey may have unique exclusive components,\nbut\n\n292\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.960\nyou have a collection of services\nthat allow you to model them in a way\n\n293\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.370\nthat delivers to the business\nwhat they're trying to achieve.\n\n294\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:06.640\nThat's what a service model is.\n\n295\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.260\nSo that's what service strategy does for\nyou.\n\n296\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.730\nNow, you move in to design coordination.\n\n297\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.190\nWe got the ideas of what services\nwe should have in place and\n\n298\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.350\nwe've made a strategic decision that\nwe should support the discovery of oil,\n\n299\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:27.320\nthe transportation of oil,\nthe refining of oil, etc., extraction.\n\n300\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.280\nSo we got this idea how we're gonna\ndesign IT services to satisfy\n\n301\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.830\neach one of those service areas.\n\n302\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.170\nThat's what design coordination does.\n\n303\n00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.269\nWe'll look at some detail later\nabout how design coordination\n\n304\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.070\ndesigns the specific\naspects within a service.\n\n305\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.630\nWe'll talk in detail about\nthe service design package, etc.\n\n306\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.650\nBut moving from strategy down to design,\n\n307\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.048\nyou'll see that strategy made the decision\nof what services we should have.\n\n308\n00:17:54.048 --> 00:17:58.050\nIt's now design stage that's gonna\nsee well, how do we do this?\n\n309\n00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.360\nHow do we make this thing possible in the\nright spend, for a right amount of money,\n\n310\n00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.680\nin the right amount of time, and\nwith a right amount of quality?\n\n311\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.149\nThat's what design is trying to answer.\n\n312\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.420\nSo along the way, you're gonna\nbe communicating these things.\n\n313\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.909\nAnd communicating this through service\ntransition is a big piece of it.\n\n314\n00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:19.869\nSo you've made some strategic\ndecisions with the customer involved,\n\n315\n00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:23.920\nyou've made some design decisions\nwith the customer involved.\n\n316\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.010\nAnd now you're gonna recommit with\nthe customers and other stakeholders, not\n\n317\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.410\njust the customer stakeholders, a way to\nvalidate the design is actually effective.\n\n318\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.900\nSo you might get involved in user\nacceptance testing, the customers that is.\n\n319\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.132\nYou might get the availability managers,\nan IT group,\n\n320\n00:18:42.132 --> 00:18:46.060\navailable to test for availability or\ncapacity or security.\n\n321\n00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.170\nYou may have some security compliance\nsign off or check off as part of\n\n322\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.480\nthe transition to make sure everything is\nright on the security side of things, etc.\n\n323\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.010\nAre the suppliers ready to go?\n\n324\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.980\nAre the contracts signed?\n\n325\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.030\nAre they ready to perform?\n\n326\n00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.600\nHas training been performed or executed?\n\n327\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.030\nHas knowledge been transferred\nto the right people?\n\n328\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.820\nIs the service desk ready?\n\n329\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.580\nThese things are going on, lots of\ndifferent stakeholders with lots of\n\n330\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.820\ndifferent stakes in the game,\nand service transition,\n\n331\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.200\nyou're bringing them all together,\nyou're bringing them to life.\n\n332\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.200\nSo that they're validated and acceptable.\n\n333\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.660\nService accept this criteria has been met.\n\n334\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.500\nAnd then, of course, you bring it to,\nthrough transition, through workshops,\n\n335\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.820\nthrough training organization,\nnewsletters.\n\n336\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.650\nOrganizational meetings, lots of things.\n\n337\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.120\nLots of ways of communicating,\nalways in play.\n\n338\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.250\nSo consider the media is\nthe message sometimes.\n\n339\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.680\nIs it a great big global meaning?\n\n340\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.310\nEveryone's there at the same time.\n\n341\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.540\nIs it sub team meetings?\n\n342\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.270\nIs it face to face training?\n\n343\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.140\nIs is something you say,\nhey go take this module online.\n\n344\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.795\nLet me know when you've completed it.\n\n345\n00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:51.956\nDepending on what kind of knowledge you're\ntrying to impart or how important it is,\n\n346\n00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:55.415\nyou might have different points of\nvalidation for that training or for\n\n347\n00:19:55.415 --> 00:19:56.778\nthat knowledge transfer.\n\n348\n00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:58.875\nAgain, no magic elixir here.\n\n349\n00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:01.650\nJust look at it broadly and\ncover the bases.\n\n350\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.710\nIn this particular diagram,\nwhat you're trying to move, you can see,\n\n351\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.420\nfrom current state to the predicted state.\n\n352\n00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.970\nSo, we expected certain\nthings to be in place.\n\n353\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.270\nDid we get there?\n\n354\n00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:21.830\nYou could look at it as a before,\nafter, a change evaluation.\n\n355\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.090\nWhere it says,\nhere's what we expect to get.\n\n356\n00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.800\nAnd then after the change is implemented\nyou say, did we actually get it?\n\n357\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.990\nSo there's various ways\nto skin this cat but\n\n358\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.150\nthe overarching importance of this is\nyou communicate all the way through.\n\n359\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.120\nYou know what success looks like and\nthen you ask yourself, did we reach it?\n\n360\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.195\nAnd this happens, not just in transition,\n\n361\n00:20:42.195 --> 00:20:46.669\nit happens in operations, too,\nbut you continue to move forward.\n\n362\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.630\nAll communication must have an intended\npurpose or a resulted action.\n\n363\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.450\nLet me put this another way,\ndon't communicate just because.\n\n364\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.735\nCommunicate with purpose.\n\n365\n00:20:58.735 --> 00:21:03.357\nAnd you communicate with purpose\nwith the audience in mind.\n\n366\n00:21:03.357 --> 00:21:06.315\nSo make it real to the audience\nyou are sending to.\n\n367\n00:21:06.315 --> 00:21:07.925\nIf action is requested or\n\n368\n00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:12.175\nrequired at the end of the communication,\nbe explicit about what action.\n\n369\n00:21:12.175 --> 00:21:15.565\nIf it's just an FYI,\nactually be explicit about that.\n\n370\n00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.005\nThis is for information,\nno action is required.\n\n371\n00:21:19.285 --> 00:21:23.570\nIt just helps with the communication\nby setting expectations,\n\n372\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.820\nwhat's the person, the recipient of\nyour message supposed to do with it?\n\n373\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.750\nAre they supposed to do something\nmeaningful, in terms of action?\n\n374\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.510\nAre they supposed to follow the way for\na future meeting?\n\n375\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.928\nAre they supposed to go out and\nevaluate something?\n\n376\n00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:44.575\nSo, be clear about the intended purpose\nof the particular communication.\n\n377\n00:21:47.408 --> 00:21:48.510\nHow many ways?\n\n378\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.360\nYou can send them things, you can have\nmeetings, that's a means of communication,\n\n379\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.860\ngetting together.\n\n380\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.850\nThe frequency of the meetings\ncan also be part of it.\n\n381\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.830\nIt can also be part of the message, we're\ngonna meet everyday until this is fixed,\n\n382\n00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.350\nis a different message than saying,\nhow about we meet next month and\n\n383\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.190\nsee how you guys are doing?\n\n384\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.220\nEven the frequency of the meetings\ncan be communicating something.\n\n385\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.860\nSo I don't wanna wait til\nthe end of the month.\n\n386\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.460\nI wanna meet every day or every week\nuntil we get this thing resolved.\n\n387\n00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.910\nAs an example,\n\n388\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:23.380\nthe frequency of meetings could also\nbe part of the communication message.\n\n389\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.780\nThe medium itself,\nis it simply an email or is it a meeting?\n\n390\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.707\nComparing a message being sent to a\nmeeting, getting people in the same room,\n\n391\n00:22:31.707 --> 00:22:34.779\nwhether it's a virtual room or\na physical room.\n\n392\n00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:38.209\nIs a different thing than\njust sending out an email.\n\n393\n00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:44.480\nSo, coming up with all these various\nmeans or all these stakeholders,\n\n394\n00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.576\nstakeholder map and trying to move them,\nsuggests that you should actually\n\n395\n00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:52.670\nbe methodical about your\ncommunication strategy and your plan.\n\n396\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.792\nWrite down what it is you plan to do.\n\n397\n00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:58.162\nWe're gonna meet with the customer\nstakeholders once a month.\n\n398\n00:22:58.162 --> 00:23:00.582\nWe're gonna meet with\nthe design people once a week.\n\n399\n00:23:00.582 --> 00:23:03.080\nWe're gonna meet with\nthe testers once a week.\n\n400\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.350\nWe're going to meet with the service\ndesk once a week, however that might be.\n\n401\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.020\nIt may start off once a month\nwith the service desk.\n\n402\n00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.670\nAs you get closer to operations\nmaybe you're meeting every day\n\n403\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.520\nwith the service desk.\n\n404\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.600\nUnderstanding the frequency\nof communication and\n\n405\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.270\nthe stakeholders, is going to help\ndrive the strategy and this plan.\n\n406\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.133\nThe media, the way you present\nthe information is one consideration.\n\n407\n00:23:27.133 --> 00:23:29.680\nHow often you can do it, is another.\n\n408\n00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.780\nAnd remember, it's not one size fits all.\n\n409\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:38.053\nOne blanket statement to all audiences is\neffective for some types of communication.\n\n410\n00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:41.215\nIt's disruptive for\nother types of communication,\n\n411\n00:23:41.215 --> 00:23:45.655\nwhere you need to get very specific to\nthe actions that need to be required.\n\n412\n00:23:45.655 --> 00:23:49.401\nSo no real magic, somewhat, common sense.\n\n413\n00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:52.140\nAs you take this operationally\nback at the office,\n\n414\n00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.082\nhaving a discipline of\nplanning your communication.\n\n415\n00:23:55.082 --> 00:23:57.521\nIs better than just kind of winging it,\nright.\n\n416\n00:23:57.521 --> 00:24:00.729\nAnd it starts with understanding\nyour stakeholders, and\n\n417\n00:24:00.729 --> 00:24:05.384\nunderstanding what messages need to be\ndelivered, how often, and to whom, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:05.384 --> 00:24:06.303\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n419\n00:24:06.303 --> 00:24:08.070\n&gt;&gt; So coming up with a plan, then.\n\n420\n00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.850\nThe strategies, the big picture, the plan\nis the very specific deliverables.\n\n421\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.830\nAnd once you've done one or\ntwo of these, it becomes almost rote.\n\n422\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.500\nYou understand your stakeholders better,\nyou can reuse the plans\n\n423\n00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.080\nfrom one big project to another,\nand just tweak the differences.\n\n424\n00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.050\nIt really can be done in a rather\nrepetitive way, so just get good at it.\n\n425\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.470\nITIL is not a communications planning\nbest practice, it's not intended to be.\n\n426\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:41.239\nBut that said, ITIL certain recognizes\nthe importance of effective communication.\n\n427\n00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:46.791\nAll right, Key exam factors,\n\n428\n00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:51.620\nso this is really for,I t also helps\nyou in operational context too.\n\n429\n00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.660\nBut as we finish up this particular topic,\nkey exam factors for\n\n430\n00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.720\ncommunication is look for,\nin the exam,I n the scenario or\n\n431\n00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.550\nwithin the question,\nor within the answers.\n\n432\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.071\nAnd ask the question,\nis the communication two-way?\n\n433\n00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:10.186\nIn other words, is there ability to get\nfeedback from the stakeholder you're\n\n434\n00:25:10.186 --> 00:25:13.192\ncommunicating with,\nis that built into your planning?\n\n435\n00:25:13.192 --> 00:25:16.999\nBecause communication\nshould be bidirectional,\n\n436\n00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:20.015\nnot just broadcast and hope they get it.\n\n437\n00:25:20.015 --> 00:25:21.945\nThe feedback could be simple,\nit could be simple,\n\n438\n00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:25.362\ndid you get it,\ndid you understand it, right?\n\n439\n00:25:25.362 --> 00:25:26.859\nDo you know you have action to do, right?\n\n440\n00:25:28.082 --> 00:25:29.772\nAnd of course, the ultimate feedback,\n\n441\n00:25:29.772 --> 00:25:32.882\nif there's action to be done,\nis that the action is completed.\n\n442\n00:25:32.882 --> 00:25:34.632\nThat's why it needs to be two-way.\n\n443\n00:25:34.632 --> 00:25:38.348\nBut even if it's really just informational\nonly, you want to make sure that they can\n\n444\n00:25:38.348 --> 00:25:41.282\nfeedback to you whether they go it or\nnot, right?\n\n445\n00:25:41.282 --> 00:25:45.102\nIf they choose not to respond,\nyou can selectively say, okay,\n\n446\n00:25:45.102 --> 00:25:47.952\nwell they must have understood it,\nall right?\n\n447\n00:25:47.952 --> 00:25:51.433\nOr you could be more proactive and say,\nI want to make sure they understand it.\n\n448\n00:25:51.433 --> 00:25:54.550\nAnd I'm going to send it again to\nthem next month, that same message.\n\n449\n00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.670\nIs communication tailored appropriately?\n\n450\n00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.030\nAnother good question,\n\n451\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:06.220\ndoes it meet the stakeholder that\nyou're trying to target, right?\n\n452\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.770\nA business leader's not\ngoing to be too concerned\n\n453\n00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.650\nabout the details of how you\nmanage a test case in UAT.\n\n454\n00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.880\nThey wanna know, did UAT pass, right?\n\n455\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.670\nNot necessarily the nuances of\nthe failures of user acceptance testing.\n\n456\n00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.277\nSo when you send out the email\nregarding the failed attempt at user\n\n457\n00:26:25.277 --> 00:26:27.300\nacceptance testing, UAT.\n\n458\n00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:32.126\nWhen you're sending out that email,\nyou're gonna send a different email to\n\n459\n00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:36.950\nthe project team, up, than you would\nfrom the project team, down, right,\n\n460\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.540\nto the practitioners down below.\n\n461\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.490\nSo make sure you got the right\naudience in mind, and\n\n462\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.880\nyou're communicating at the right time,\nright, further action, etc.\n\n463\n00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.710\nIs communication constant, all right, is\nit frequent enough, is it always in play?\n\n464\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:59.980\nThis plays back to the two-way part, as\nwell as communicating at the right time.\n\n465\n00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.873\nAlways have the channels open, so\n\n466\n00:27:01.873 --> 00:27:05.019\nthat's one way that communication\nis always constant.\n\n467\n00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:09.554\nBut realize that repeating a message\nis not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n468\n00:27:09.554 --> 00:27:12.668\nEspecially if time has passed since\nthe last one, and milestones,\n\n469\n00:27:12.668 --> 00:27:15.560\nmore importantly,\nhave passed since the last one.\n\n470\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.780\nYou're getting closer to your targets,\nright?\n\n471\n00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.360\nSo the message could be right today,\nbut does not resonate later,\n\n472\n00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.310\nso make sure you you tweak the message\nas you go through, as well.\n\n473\n00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.970\nAnd is communication inclusive?\n\n474\n00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.130\nNow, earlier when I mentioned that\ncommunication should be tailored for\n\n475\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.010\nthe right audience,\nyour communication plan\n\n476\n00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.993\nshould holistically cover all\nyour stakeholders, right?\n\n477\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.930\nThe four major groups that we've talked\nabout before, the service provider,\n\n478\n00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.112\nthe customer, the user, the suppliers, and\nall the subtexts underneath those, right?\n\n479\n00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.021\nAs you come up with your stakeholder\nplan and your communication plan,\n\n480\n00:27:53.021 --> 00:27:55.810\nare you including the broad scope, right?\n\n481\n00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.280\nA very easy thing academically,\nwhen you're taking a test,\n\n482\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.040\nthat is, is if the questions and\n\n483\n00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.461\nthe answers somehow exclude the customer,\nit cannot be the right answer, all right.\n\n484\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.362\nIf you somehow leave out a key\nstakeholder, whether it's the customer or\n\n485\n00:28:13.362 --> 00:28:16.285\nnot, certainly a customer\nalways should be involved, but\n\n486\n00:28:16.285 --> 00:28:18.926\nit could be that you leave\nout some key stakeholders.\n\n487\n00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:23.301\nAnd it's explicit, it'll say, don't\ninvite them, right, don't invite them,\n\n488\n00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:25.090\njust work within your team.\n\n489\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.725\nThat's a red flag,\non the ITIL exam, that's a red flag.\n\n490\n00:28:28.725 --> 00:28:31.362\nI understand why we kinda limit\nthe message sometimes, and\n\n491\n00:28:31.362 --> 00:28:33.113\nwe invite fewer people to the meeting.\n\n492\n00:28:33.113 --> 00:28:36.029\nBecause the more people you invite,\nthe harder the meeting is,\n\n493\n00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:37.540\nto work through an agenda.\n\n494\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.940\nI get that challenge, and\nthe dynamic of the business.\n\n495\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.210\nBut ITIL,\nwhile they recognize that challenge,\n\n496\n00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.520\ndon't want you to ignore\nthe importance of inclusion.\n\n497\n00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.560\nSo it's better to have them in\nthe meeting, and work through their\n\n498\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.830\nobjections, than it would be to face those\nobjections later, when success is gonna be\n\n499\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.410\nmore critical, all right, so-\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n500\n00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty much\nthe subject matter related to this.\n\n501\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.059\nI would like to draw your attention\nto this slide, though, there is\n\n502\n00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:09.640\nan exercise available, it's available\nto you just up here, in Episode Files.\n\n503\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.741\nAnd it's a practice, a little exercise\nthat walks you through some of the steps,\n\n504\n00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:15.954\nand some of the things we've talked about.\n\n505\n00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:21.418\nAnd this particular one is called Generic\nRoles, which gives you a foundational\n\n506\n00:29:21.418 --> 00:29:26.410\naspect to the roles of service owner,\nprocess owner, process manager.\n\n507\n00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.260\nBusiness relationship manager versus\nbusiness relationship process owner, and\n\n508\n00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.710\nthose types of things.\n\n509\n00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:36.020\nAnd gives you the basis for\nunderstanding how a RACI chart\n\n510\n00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.090\nmight flesh out for\nthose generic roles, as you go through.\n\n511\n00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.290\nSo don't forget\nthe importance of self-study,\n\n512\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:46.920\nexercises are available up there, sample\npaper, practices are available up there.\n\n513\n00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.570\nDive in, and please join the forum,\nask questions here at ITProTV.\n\n514\n00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.327\nOther experts,\nof other peers that are taking the course.\n\n515\n00:29:54.327 --> 00:29:58.472\nAnd if you have any darkness,\ndark areas, I should say?\n\n516\n00:29:58.472 --> 00:30:01.880\nBring them to the forum,\nwe can shine light.\n\n517\n00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.380\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n518\n00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:02.884\n&gt;&gt; Great job,\n\n519\n00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.678\ncommunication/stakeholder management.\nAnd I wanna communicate to you, Terry,\n\n520\n00:30:06.678 --> 00:30:09.263\nthat you're doing an amazing job as usual,\nthank you so\n\n521\n00:30:09.263 --> 00:30:10.300\nvery much.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n522\n00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.170\n&gt;&gt; And thank you

00:00:08.443\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:10.747\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:15.924\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:18.620\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.530\nI'm your host Zack Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.020\nAs we continue on, With ITIL MALC and\na focus on integration is our topic.\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.010\nWith us is Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.470\nTerry, good to see you sir.\n\n11\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.210\n&gt;&gt; As always Zach I'm happy to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.180\nAnd as Zach said we're gonna\nbe focusing on integration.\n\n13\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.280\nAs we looked that foundation, and as we\nlooked at the intermediate level exams,\n\n14\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.130\nthe focus got increasingly\nmore integrated.\n\n15\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.940\nI will say that.\n\n16\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.130\nFoundation was rote memorization\nwith lots of disparate topics and\n\n17\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.740\nyou had to recall things.\n\n18\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.110\nIntermediate would focus on a particular\namount of subject matter but\n\n19\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.770\nnot all the lifecycle.\n\n20\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.460\nThere'd be some subset of the lifecycle\nthat you are focusing on.\n\n21\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.770\nSo therefore, the challenge\nof integration was limited to\n\n22\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.720\nthe challenge of integrating among\nthose processes within that subset.\n\n23\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.503\nAs we go to MALC, however, MALC is looking\nat managing across the life cycle,\n\n24\n00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.955\nthe entire life cycle.\n\n25\n00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:16.830\nSo integration across all the life cycle\nis really what we're talking about here.\n\n26\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.980\nSo the subject matter is\nnot that much different.\n\n27\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.060\nWe'll certainly about how\nstrategy interfaces with design,\n\n28\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.230\ninterface with transition and\noperations and CSI.\n\n29\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.060\nWe'll also dive into some processes,\nthe CLE integrate with each other.\n\n30\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.970\nSo it's a similar\nexercise in academics but\n\n31\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.010\nI want you to take that 5,000\nfoot view as we look at this and\n\n32\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.000\nlook at the stages in their integral\nparts and how they fit together, right?\n\n33\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030\nSo let's first of all start with process.\n\n34\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.831\nIf you look at the graphic here,\n\n35\n00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:50.309\neffectively what you're talking about\nwhen integrating across a lifecycle,\n\n36\n00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:55.346\neffectively what you're talking about is\nintegrating process and integrating roles.\n\n37\n00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:59.801\nSo integrating these process is really\nunderstanding the roles interact with\n\n38\n00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.140\neach other.\n\n39\n00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.320\nSo where does the service\nowners responsibilities end and\n\n40\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.550\nbusiness relationship pick\nup as an example, right?\n\n41\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.151\nSo was we begin to dive into this focus\nand as you continue to reenergize learning\n\n42\n00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:19.854\nyou all ready had, please pay real close\nattention on what the people are doing.\n\n43\n00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:24.421\nAnd what the processes are doing to make\nsure there's efficient and sufficient,\n\n44\n00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:28.300\nefficient and sufficient handoff\nat the appropriate times.\n\n45\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.299\nBy efficiency I mean you don't\noverlap too much, right?\n\n46\n00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.429\nThere is a handoff among the different\nroles, and by sufficiency is that\n\n47\n00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:39.460\nyou've covered all the bases,\nthere's no missing pieces, right?\n\n48\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.350\nSo as you can see here,\nwe've got service owner, process owners,\n\n49\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.840\nthe process practitioners, the ones on\nthe ground getting things done, right?\n\n50\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.460\nAnd then other stakeholders.\n\n51\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.600\nHow does this interface\nwith your suppliers,\n\n52\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.590\nor how does it interface with\nyour other process owners, or\n\n53\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.690\nyour other business partners, or\nother stakeholders within IT?\n\n54\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.085\nSo understanding the scope,\npurpose, and value of each process,\n\n55\n00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:08.015\nwith an overlay of who\nis doing those things,\n\n56\n00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:12.197\nis where you really get this idea\nof integration becoming real.\n\n57\n00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:16.320\nAnd MALC invites you to do\nthat every singe question.\n\n58\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.030\nHow do we integrate these across,\n\n59\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.480\nmanage across the life cycle is\nwhat we're trying to get down here.\n\n60\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.240\nCertainly, the role of your service\nknowledge management system is gonna be\n\n61\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.660\nkey, right.\n\n62\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.430\nMaking sure you have appropriate\ninformation available at each stage and\n\n63\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.540\nthat information is passed down\nappropriately to the other stages.\n\n64\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.195\nMore importantly, let's all look at\nthis next graphic have a look at this.\n\n65\n00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:38.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice the waterfall effect.\n\n66\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.600\nService strategy kind of downloads its\ninformation towards service design.\n\n67\n00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.350\nDesign takes those good\nstrategic decisions, and\n\n68\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.120\ntries to design an appropriate service.\n\n69\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.360\nAnd they answer all the good questions\nthat need to be answered, and put\n\n70\n00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.780\nthose into a Service Design Package, that\nthey then pass down to Service Transition.\n\n71\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.020\nService Transition takes that\ngood Service Design Package, and\n\n72\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.860\nmakes the thing come to life.\n\n73\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.100\nThis thing called a service, right?\n\n74\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.430\nAnd after it's brought to life they\ncan transition it into operation so\n\n75\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.150\nthat value can be delivered\nback to the business.\n\n76\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.740\nSo I like that little waterfall effect,\nit starts at the top, rolls its way down.\n\n77\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.410\nIt's an interesting way to look at it.\n\n78\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.499\nBut please note,\n\n79\n00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:26.084\neven this graphical treatment these\nlittle arrows going back to the SKMS.\n\n80\n00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:31.213\nThey each one of these stages is feeding\ninto the various information and\n\n81\n00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:33.240\ndata that's responsible.\n\n82\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.920\nOr they allows us to be responsible\nabout designing good services,\n\n83\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.320\nmaking good strategic decisions,\ntransitioning effectively etc., right?\n\n84\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.340\nAnd notice that there is also\narrows flowing upstream, right?\n\n85\n00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.010\nThey go back up.\n\n86\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.030\nSo these stages are intended to\nhave these constant feedback loops.\n\n87\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.020\nLet me put this a different way.\n\n88\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.420\nIt would be really silly for\n\n89\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.680\nserver strategists to make\na decision in a vacuum.\n\n90\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.790\nTo say, okay, let's go ahead and\nspend that $3 million for\n\n91\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.480\nthis project this year to bring in\na new IT Service Management Suite.\n\n92\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.090\nLet's just go ahead and\nmake that decision, and\n\n93\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.289\nwe'll let them figure out the details.\n\n94\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.060\nWell, was three men enough,\nwas three men too much, right?\n\n95\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.900\nIt would be silly for service strategist\nto make such a decision without involving\n\n96\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.900\npeople from design, people from\ntransition, people from operations, right?\n\n97\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.169\nYou got to get everyone\ninvolved in such decisions.\n\n98\n00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.449\nSo the stakeholders being managed\nthere are within IT predominantly.\n\n99\n00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.500\nBut what about the business value?\n\n100\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.297\nWhat are you gonna be delivering\nback to the business?\n\n101\n00:05:34.297 --> 00:05:37.543\nIf you implement a new\nIT Service Management Suite,\n\n102\n00:05:37.543 --> 00:05:39.550\nhave you got them to buy in?\n\n103\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.050\nDoes the business leaders think it's\na good idea for IT to spend $3 million\n\n104\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.320\nof their money, on something that only\nIT is gonna be using or primarily using.\n\n105\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.920\nSo you're managing those\nstakeholders well enough?\n\n106\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.770\nSo again, I think, again,\nthat's probably an egregious example.\n\n107\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.770\nBut I'm trying to show you in stark\ncontrast just how silly it would be for\n\n108\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.700\nservice strategists to make decisions.\n\n109\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.150\nWithout appropriate feedback\nfrom those other stakeholders,\n\n110\n00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.900\nwithin the IT organization.\n\n111\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.340\nWithin your IT service management\nframework as well as with the business.\n\n112\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.470\nSo these feedback loops need\nto be open all the time.\n\n113\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.090\nWe talked about, in previous episodes,\n\n114\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.570\nabout the importance of\ntwo-way communication.\n\n115\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.710\nCertainly, when you talk about process\nintegration and capability integration,\n\n116\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.450\nyou're talking about the sharing of\nknowledge across the organization.\n\n117\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.250\nSo again, what do service strategy and\nservice design bring to this game?\n\n118\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.720\nService Strategy defines what services\nshould be delivered, design makes those\n\n119\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.480\nthings possible by answering all the good\nquestions that need to be asked.\n\n120\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.570\nHow big does it have to be?\n\n121\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.530\nHow small?\n\n122\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.570\nWhat kind of functionality?\n\n123\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.030\nWhat kind of availability\nis it gonna have?\n\n124\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.360\nDo we have suppliers that can\nprovide the development work, or\n\n125\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.200\ndo we have to do it ourselves, right?\n\n126\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.070\nMaking all those real important\ndecisions at a design level\n\n127\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.860\nallows transition to be more effective for\nsure.\n\n128\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.570\nSo how does service strategy\ninteract with transition?\n\n129\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.200\nGetting feedback for\nwhat their capabilities are.\n\n130\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.785\nCan we effectively test for performance or\nare we gonna have to use benchmark\n\n131\n00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:08.330\nmeasurements that we get\nfrom the industry, right?\n\n132\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.250\nAre we gonna accept the vendor's\nrecommendation for for scale?\n\n133\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.400\nAre we going to test it ourselves?\n\n134\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.530\nTransition, the people, the practitioners,\n\n135\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.810\nthe service transition can help make an\ninformed decision about how much we should\n\n136\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.540\ninvest in whatever area of transition\nprocesses we need to bring forth, right?\n\n137\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.130\nAnd back and forth, right?\n\n138\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.020\nSo strategy is telling transition\nwhat we should be working on, but\n\n139\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.350\ntransition is telling strategy\nwhat's possible, right?\n\n140\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.750\nAnd what's affordable.\n\n141\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.010\nSame with operations Service strategy\nneeds to interact with operations to\n\n142\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.170\ndetermine what is actually possible.\n\n143\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.750\nDo we have enough staff for the amount\nof training to support such a service?\n\n144\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.440\nImagine Barnes and\nNoble before Amazon.com.\n\n145\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.966\nBarnes and Noble, a brick and\nmortar bookseller, right?\n\n146\n00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:57.536\nCushy chairs, nice brown paneling,\ncoffee nearby,\n\n147\n00:07:57.536 --> 00:08:02.046\nvery nice place to go and shop and\nbrowse for books, and music etc..\n\n148\n00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:06.584\nNow, when amazon.com became more of\na competitive reality for Barnes and\n\n149\n00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:10.470\nNoble, what was the IT\ndepartment thinking then?\n\n150\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.250\nHow was that IT department gonna\nhave to transform themselves\n\n151\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.360\ninto being a service provider for\ntheir business now?\n\n152\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.870\nRight?\n\n153\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.680\nWere they going to have n\ne-commerce solution that's a bit\n\n154\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.060\nmore robust than the one\nthey currently had.\n\n155\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.820\nAre they going to have an e-reader?\n\n156\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.100\nThose types of things.\n\n157\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.270\nSo, certainly the competitive\njuices were flowing for\n\n158\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.420\nthe business called Barnes and Noble.\n\n159\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.670\nThat those juices get flowing for\nthe IT organization as well.\n\n160\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.770\nAnd how well do those juices\nflow is really kind of\n\n161\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.380\nthe question we're trying to ask here.\n\n162\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.220\nSo operationally speaking, server\nstrategists looking at their current\n\n163\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.840\ncapability at the operational level say,\nwhat's possible for us to do?\n\n164\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.430\nWhere do we need to invest if we\nwanna compete in this kind of market?\n\n165\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.170\nAre we gonna tear down all of our stores?\n\n166\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.750\nAre we still gonna be\na brick-and-mortar bookstore?\n\n167\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.820\nWhat is our business strategy?\n\n168\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.730\nSo the business is thinking\nwhat's ITs response to that and\n\n169\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.180\nmore importantly in this particular\ncontext, what is ITs capability right now.\n\n170\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.132\nDo we need to invest in new capabilities?\n\n171\n00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.590\nYou're gonna get a lot of that\nfeedback from the operations people.\n\n172\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.500\nWhat skill sets do they\ncurrently have in place?\n\n173\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.880\nHow scalable are they?\n\n174\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.130\nCan we reuse some of our assets\nnow toward these new directions?\n\n175\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.410\nDo we have to reinvest in\nwhole new infrastructure, etc.\n\n176\n00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.830\nSo you get the challenge to that.\n\n177\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.423\nServer strategists could\nnot make that wise decision\n\n178\n00:09:27.423 --> 00:09:31.056\nwithout necessarily understanding\nwhat their current operations cost,\n\n179\n00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:32.566\nwhat capabilities they have.\n\n180\n00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:33.934\nSo that's good feedback there.\n\n181\n00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:34.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it's great.\n\n182\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.155\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Putting all these nuts and\n\n183\n00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:36.995\nbolts together.\n\n184\n00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:37.575\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n185\n00:09:38.855 --> 00:09:40.075\n&gt;&gt; So again, it would be silly for\n\n186\n00:09:40.075 --> 00:09:43.245\nservice strategy to be operating\non an island all by themselves.\n\n187\n00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:45.375\nThey have to integrate\nwith the other stages.\n\n188\n00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.125\nThat's the overarching theme here\nis the focus on integration.\n\n189\n00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.145\nYou're gonna have to integrate\nacross the life cycle.\n\n190\n00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:53.845\nYou're gonna have to manage\nacross the life cycle.\n\n191\n00:09:53.845 --> 00:09:58.689\nThis is another just a way to consider\nthe big picture of what other\n\n192\n00:09:58.689 --> 00:10:02.670\nlifecycle stages we'll have to deal with.\n\n193\n00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.320\nCertainly you can consider service design.\n\n194\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.560\nThese are the constraints\nyou're trying to deal with.\n\n195\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.010\nIt's a pretty neat little graphic here.\n\n196\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.890\nIf you look at the full graphic here,\n\n197\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.645\nservice design needs to understand what\nis the expected level of warranty and\n\n198\n00:10:14.645 --> 00:10:17.615\nwhat's the expected level of\nutility to be provided, right.\n\n199\n00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:20.565\nJust how many bells and\nwhistles is this gonna have, right.\n\n200\n00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:22.655\nAnd how available does it have to be.\n\n201\n00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.492\nIs it 24/7?\n\n202\n00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:24.962\nIs it just Monday through Friday?\n\n203\n00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:25.572\nIs it 9 o 5?\n\n204\n00:10:25.572 --> 00:10:29.272\nThose are questions that\nare being played out here.\n\n205\n00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:31.712\nSo those are the operating constraints,\n\n206\n00:10:31.712 --> 00:10:34.712\nif you will, this much warranty and\nthis much utility.\n\n207\n00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:36.460\nAnd look what's all in between them.\n\n208\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.080\nRight.\n\n209\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.670\nWhat are resources?\n\n210\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.140\nDo we have the skill set?\n\n211\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.705\nShould we buy something off the shelf,\nshould we develop ourself?\n\n212\n00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:43.830\nRight.\n\n213\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.720\nCan we distinguish ourselves in the\nmarketplace with a homegrown solution that\n\n214\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.950\nwill drive better business outcomes\nbecause we're better at this, right.\n\n215\n00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.700\nWhat are our values and ethics?\n\n216\n00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.920\nHow much money do we have?\n\n217\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.800\nWhat are technology constraints?\n\n218\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.740\nRight, so\nin between that level of warranty and\n\n219\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.020\nthe level of utility are all these\nconsiderations about your assets.\n\n220\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.080\nHow good are they, how mature are they,\n\n221\n00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.120\nhow well honed are they,\nhow weak they are, etc.\n\n222\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.960\nHow much does it cost, how much money do\nwe have, the operational constraints,\n\n223\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.925\nthe time constraints, etc.\n\n224\n00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:21.670\nSo, design, as a life cycle stage,\nis operating within those constraints.\n\n225\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.880\nThey got to deliver on warrant.\n\n226\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.960\nThey got to deliver on utility.\n\n227\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.080\nBut what is the balance that they\nhave to bring to the design to\n\n228\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.070\nsatisfy these other constraints\nthat you're operating with, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:38.360\nSo, moving from strategy now to\nwhat design has to deal with.\n\n230\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.130\nDesign is dealing with the right balance.\n\n231\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.945\nYou see a nice little bulleted list here.\n\n232\n00:11:43.945 --> 00:11:45.990\nIt;s getting the requirements and\n\n233\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.050\nturning those requirements into\nsomething that's actionable, right?\n\n234\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.610\nYou're not building it yet, but\nyou're just designing it yet.\n\n235\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.070\n&gt;&gt; Now, you were saying\ndesign makes things happen.\n\n236\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:56.580\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n237\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Makes things possible, possible.\n\n238\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.255\nMakes thing possible, right.\n\n239\n00:12:00.255 --> 00:12:04.715\nIt's putting to paper, if you will,\nthe appropriate approach for\n\n240\n00:12:04.715 --> 00:12:06.675\nhow we can bring this service to life.\n\n241\n00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:10.075\nAnd in transition, that particular stage,\nwill bring it to life.\n\n242\n00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:11.362\nBut before you can bring\nsomething to life,\n\n243\n00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:13.572\nyou gotta understand how it\ncould be brought to life.\n\n244\n00:12:13.572 --> 00:12:15.372\nHow many servers are going in need?\n\n245\n00:12:15.372 --> 00:12:16.752\nHow we gonna test it?\n\n246\n00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:18.822\nDo processes need to be re-engineered?\n\n247\n00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.622\nDo we have the right capabilities\nin our supplier pool?\n\n248\n00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:26.270\nDo we have the proper, right capabilities\nwithin our own service management pool.\n\n249\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.000\nWhat do we outsource, what do we not, etc.\n\n250\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.159\nDesign has lots of constraints to operate\nthem with, time, money, capabilities.\n\n251\n00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:35.253\nWhat are we gonna be able to do, right?\n\n252\n00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:37.863\nA key component,\nI'm just gonna highlight it here,\n\n253\n00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:42.490\nis that service design actually answers\nthe question, what does success look like?\n\n254\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.450\nIt's called here service\nacceptance criteria.\n\n255\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.140\nIt's within the service acceptance\ncriteria, very key deliverable.\n\n256\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.710\nAt service design,\nyou are saying what success looks like.\n\n257\n00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.200\nThis is not a trivial matter.\n\n258\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.480\nNow, you can have service\nacceptance criteria for a system.\n\n259\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.660\nAnd that could be system\nintegration passes,\n\n260\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.490\nuser acceptance testing passes,\nperformance test pass.\n\n261\n00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.550\nAnd then step away from it, right.\n\n262\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.105\nYou've handled a bit of the utility,\nyou've handled a bit of the warranty and\n\n263\n00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:15.020\nyou're accepting that this\nsystem is ready, right.\n\n264\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.910\nService acceptance criteria is\na little bit broader than just system\n\n265\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.850\nacceptance criteria.\n\n266\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.090\nRemember that, the difference between\na system and a service is many fold,\n\n267\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.170\nthere's lots of things to consider there.\n\n268\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.630\nService acceptance could include,\nwe have the capacity at the service desk,\n\n269\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.330\nenough people with the right\nknowledge to support this service.\n\n270\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.170\nIf the service requires headsets, you\nknow, you're introducing a new service,\n\n271\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.747\nbut the users are actually gonna\nhave headsets to use the service.\n\n272\n00:13:41.747 --> 00:13:44.040\nHave you got enough headsets ordered?\n\n273\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.140\nI mean it could be logistics like that,\nnot just does the system work, but\n\n274\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.960\nhave we've got all these other processes\nand fulfillment needs taken care of.\n\n275\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.720\nSo in service design,\nyou're asking all those questions.\n\n276\n00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.310\nAnd coming up with a checklist of things\nthat must be put in place to consider\n\n277\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.330\nthis service acceptable.\n\n278\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.670\nSure, passes integration testing,\npasses UAT, passes performance testing.\n\n279\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.000\nThose can still be in\nservice acceptance criteria.\n\n280\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.240\nIn addition to that, we have enough\nheadsets, training has been accomplished.\n\n281\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.255\nThe users have been trained, right?\n\n282\n00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:23.250\nAnd the test results have been posted\netc., those types of things, right.\n\n283\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.960\nAgain, notice this is happening,\n\n284\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.170\nthe exceptions criteria is\nhappening at service design.\n\n285\n00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.510\nVery early.\n\n286\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.790\nThe reason I highlight that is\none of the things you might\n\n287\n00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.240\nfind in an academic setting.\n\n288\n00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.460\nI think you could also\nfind it back at work.\n\n289\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.190\nIs that you get down the line\na little bit then you realized\n\n290\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.970\nyou know what we should\nhave a performance test.\n\n291\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.780\nReally to prove this is gonna work but\n\n292\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.260\na performance test is\ngonna cost you 10 grand.\n\n293\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.410\nWhere's the 10 grand coming from?\n\n294\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.290\nThey approved this project six months ago,\nwhy are you asking for 10 grand now?\n\n295\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.000\nRight?\n\n296\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.940\nSo again, that's why you get\nthese stages involved earlier\n\n297\n00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.020\nin the strategic decision.\n\n298\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.780\nHow much money's coming?\n\n299\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.880\nBut it's also why you design success in,\ninstead of waiting for\n\n300\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.106\nlater to discover what you might need.\n\n301\n00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:07.220\nOkay.\n\n302\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.207\nAll right.\n\n303\n00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:10.260\n&gt;&gt; Grief.\n\n304\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.860\n&gt;&gt; So again, looking at the thing\nwe just talked about before.\n\n305\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:19.050\nBusiness capability is almost as\nimportant as your own capability.\n\n306\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.740\nAs an example, when I was still a\nconsulting recently with the oil company,\n\n307\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.690\nthey were introducing a new technology,\nbasically MRI.\n\n308\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.950\nI'll simplify this cuz I don't know\nthe geophysics, physical nature of this.\n\n309\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:38.660\nBut basically, instead of having to drill\ndown and bring up samples and do essays in\n\n310\n00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:44.880\na lab, basically out in the field or ship\nit to someone and they do it remotely.\n\n311\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.190\n&gt;&gt; Like a ground MRI, right?.\n\n312\n00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Basically like that, yeah.\n\n313\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.902\nSo, a new technology is driven by\ntechnology and IT service, if you will,\n\n314\n00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:59.289\nto streamline the discovery of potential\noil deposits is this idea like a MRI.\n\n315\n00:15:59.289 --> 00:16:01.980\nA magnetic resonance of the Earth, right.\n\n316\n00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.120\nPretty cool, right?\n\n317\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.440\nNow, it's one thing to have\nthis technological advancement.\n\n318\n00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.839\nIn that field.\nIt's another thing to purchase\n\n319\n00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:09.995\nthe appropriate hardware and\nsoftware to make it happen.\n\n320\n00:16:09.995 --> 00:16:13.456\nWhich IT could certainly do on\nbehalf of this company, right,\n\n321\n00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:15.490\ndo that in a streamlined way.\n\n322\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.130\nTo provide a support model for\nthe instrumentation, sure, IT can do that.\n\n323\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.360\nIT could test it,\nmake sure it works, etc., but\n\n324\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.470\nwhat if your geophysicists\ndon't know how to use it?\n\n325\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:31.090\nRight, they're still expecting a core\nsample and their assay tubes and\n\n326\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.230\neverything else.\n\n327\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.640\nSo if your geophysicists aren't\nready to move on with the service,\n\n328\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.010\nthat service is likely to fail, right?\n\n329\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.820\nSo when you see how they did it here,\n\n330\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.270\nwhat's the business capability and\nmaturity?\n\n331\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.370\nYou might not think it's your business\nat all to worry about the business'\n\n332\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.150\ncapabilities, but in fact, it is.\n\n333\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.710\nWhat you're trying to do,\nas an IT service provider,\n\n334\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.280\nis link your assets with their\nassets up in a synergetic way.\n\n335\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.010\nIf you don't know what\nthey're trying to do,\n\n336\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.370\nthen you're gonna be losing\non that proposition.\n\n337\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.270\nIf you know what they're trying to do, but\nyou don't know that they know how to do\n\n338\n00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.390\nit, you're gonna be losing\non that proposition as well.\n\n339\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.690\nSo business capacity,\n\n340\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:10.610\nbusiness maturity, is also a concern\nwhen you consider design elements.\n\n341\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.340\nThat happens to all fall under\ncapacity management, by the way.\n\n342\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.090\nCapacity management is component capacity,\nservice capacity,\n\n343\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:20.330\nas well as business capacity.\n\n344\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:24.410\nSo judging the capabilities of your\nbusiness is effectively judging\n\n345\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.960\ntheir capacity to use your service, right.\n\n346\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.780\nAnd if they're unable to use your service,\n\n347\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.260\nit doesn't matter how well\nyou've designed your service.\n\n348\n00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.020\nIf they're unable to use it,\nthat service is gonna fail.\n\n349\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.120\nSo again service design is in play here,\nvery holistic, right?\n\n350\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.498\nAgain, I'm not trying to\nteach you new things,\n\n351\n00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:44.397\nthese things would have been borne out\nin your intermediate-level learning.\n\n352\n00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:48.159\nWhat I'm trying to orient you toward\nis this holistic view, looking across,\n\n353\n00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:52.070\nmanaging across a life cycle, cuz you\ncan see how these things integrate.\n\n354\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.536\nSo the focus on integration is key.\n\n355\n00:17:53.536 --> 00:17:56.347\n&gt;&gt; 5,000-foot view.\n\n356\n00:17:56.347 --> 00:17:59.623\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, give or take 10 or 20,000\nfeet, give or take 10 or 20,000 feet and\n\n357\n00:17:59.623 --> 00:18:01.014\nsometimes they'll appreciate that.\n\n358\n00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:02.205\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\n\n359\n00:18:02.205 --> 00:18:06.591\none of the challenges of the intermediate\nlevel exams, and the MALC exam,\n\n360\n00:18:06.591 --> 00:18:11.280\nis zeroing in on details, and then\ncoming back out to the 5,000 foot view.\n\n361\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.780\nZeroing in and coming back, cuz you\ngotta pay attention to the details, or\n\n362\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.450\nyou'll miss an important factor, right?\n\n363\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.940\nAnd I think, by the way,\nisn't that true in real life, too?\n\n364\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.820\nBack at the operations,\nback at the office,\n\n365\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.470\npaying attention to details\nis a necessary evil.\n\n366\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.445\nAnd keeping the eye on the big\npicture is also a necessary evil.\n\n367\n00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:33.500\nWell, management across the life cycle\nrequires both looking at the details, and\n\n368\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.320\nzooming back out.\n\n369\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.150\n&gt;&gt; Checks and balances.\n\n370\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.290\n&gt;&gt; Checks and balances, yeah.\n\n371\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.063\n&gt;&gt; Along the way.\n\n372\n00:18:38.063 --> 00:18:41.681\n&gt;&gt; So\nto sum up here then on this integration.\n\n373\n00:18:41.681 --> 00:18:46.072\nThis is a wonderful graphic of\nhow service design is in play,\n\n374\n00:18:46.072 --> 00:18:50.270\nand some of the constraints\nwe're operating on.\n\n375\n00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.190\nIf you were to pause this\nepisode if you have time and\n\n376\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.435\nstudy this graphic, you'll have\nsome good grist for the mill here.\n\n377\n00:18:58.435 --> 00:19:02.120\nLet's have a look here,\nnotice this project team,\n\n378\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.395\nit's even highlighted in red here?\n\n379\n00:19:03.395 --> 00:19:07.920\nITIL does not present itself\nas a best practice for\n\n380\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.460\nproject management, doesn't pretend to\nbe a project management best practice.\n\n381\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.865\nHowever, you can't successfully\nimplement or bring in new services, or\n\n382\n00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:23.820\na major change to a service, without\nhaving some project discipline in play.\n\n383\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.652\nSo, this is not just a nod to\nthe importance of project management,\n\n384\n00:19:27.652 --> 00:19:31.031\nit's absolutely shaking hands\nwith project management.\n\n385\n00:19:31.031 --> 00:19:34.620\nThere is a process within service\ndesign called design coordination.\n\n386\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.036\nAnd design coordination is\nthe process that is the nice,\n\n387\n00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:43.460\nthorough handshake with\nproject management.\n\n388\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.380\nThere's also one in service transition,\nit's called transition planning and\n\n389\n00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.120\nsupport, that also is a handshake\nwith project management.\n\n390\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.180\nSo present this in this way.\n\n391\n00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:58.674\nIf project management and service\nmanagement are to be linked together?\n\n392\n00:19:58.674 --> 00:19:59.874\nIn the ITIL framework,\n\n393\n00:19:59.874 --> 00:20:03.680\nthey would be linked together\nthrough those two processes.\n\n394\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.150\nI'll put that yet another way.\n\n395\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:10.580\nIf you're a project manager for\nan organization that has a mature\n\n396\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.820\nITIL adoption, you've adopted ITIL and\nyou're very mature in it.\n\n397\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.600\nAnd you have a design coordination\nprocess, and a transition planning and\n\n398\n00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.270\nsupport process.\n\n399\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.195\nIf you're a project manager in that\nkind of organization, you are very\n\n400\n00:20:24.195 --> 00:20:28.930\nwell-versed on the deliverables of those\ntwo processes, what their outputs are.\n\n401\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.570\nBecause those two processes, what design\ncoordination does for service design,\n\n402\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.970\nis the same thing transition planning and\nsupport does for service transition.\n\n403\n00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.610\nThey shepherd the resources\nwithin that stage,\n\n404\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.564\nto make sure they're operating in\na cohesive way, in an efficient way,\n\n405\n00:20:45.564 --> 00:20:49.390\nin cost-effective ways,\nin time-effective ways.\n\n406\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.990\nIn other words, they're managing the\nresources, coordinating the resources, so\n\n407\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.950\nthat deliverables are made on time and\non budget.\n\n408\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.150\nDoes that sound like project management?\n\n409\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.339\nIn fact, it is very much\nthe principles of project management.\n\n410\n00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:06.281\nDeliver on time, on budget,\ngiven your resource constraints,\n\n411\n00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:08.727\ngiven your time and money constraints.\n\n412\n00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:12.940\nAnd making those things come together\nat the right moment, all right.\n\n413\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:20.330\nSo again, to recap, project management and\nITIL merge at those two processes,\n\n414\n00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.540\ndesign coordination and\ntransition planning and support.\n\n415\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.680\nThat's the handshake you're looking for.\n\n416\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.580\nOn the exam, as well as back at the\noffice, getting your project management\n\n417\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.670\noffice will-versed in service management\nstarts with those two processes.\n\n418\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.121\nThat's the focus on integration\nI intended to provide.\n\n419\n00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:39.552\nKnowing how these stages\ninteract with each other,\n\n420\n00:21:39.552 --> 00:21:41.659\nknowing how roles\ninteract with each other.\n\n421\n00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:45.679\nAnd more importantly, understanding how\nall of this interacts with an overall\n\n422\n00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:48.140\nscope of delivering value to customers.\n\n423\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Awesome as usual,I s there anything\nelse you'd like to add before we close out\n\n424\n00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.000\nthis segment?\n\n425\n00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I'd like to take\na look at just a couple more of things,\n\n426\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:55.930\nfor self-study.\n\n427\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.990\nFirst of all, there's a handout,\nit's called Input and\n\n428\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.810\nOutput Across the Life Cycles.\n\n429\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.740\nIt's very good,\nit shows how these processes integrate,\n\n430\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.860\nrather than me reading a bunch\nof bulleted statements to you.\n\n431\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.560\nIt's a very good way to\nsee the inner connections,\n\n432\n00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.550\nI highly recommend you\nhave a look at that.\n\n433\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.600\nAnd again, I won't say it's new learning,\n\n434\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.650\nit's re-energized learning you've already\nhad, about how these things work together.\n\n435\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:22.273\nAnd then one other thing to show you,\nthere is an episode file up above here.\n\n436\n00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:27.068\nYou can download a link there, that will\nget you to a directed self-study called\n\n437\n00:22:27.068 --> 00:22:29.410\nService Strategy Inputs and Outputs.\n\n438\n00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.981\nA 30-minute little exercise that can kind\nof walk you through the paces of how these\n\n439\n00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:34.131\ninteract with each other.\n\n440\n00:22:34.131 --> 00:22:36.789\nIt's more of a thought-provoking exercise.\n\n441\n00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:39.196\nIf those thoughts\nare already well-provoked,\n\n442\n00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:42.110\nthen you might find less\nvalue in that exercise.\n\n443\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.980\nIf they're not,\nit's a way to re-energize them.\n\n444\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.050\nSo don't forget the options for\n\n445\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:51.380\nself study, very important, and I'll look\nback to see you another episode soon.\n\n446\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.190\n&gt;&gt; Terry, you do a wonderful job,\nI'm going to applaud you right now.\n\n447\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.248\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very good.\n\n448\n00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:58.196\nA focus on integration, ITIL MALC.\n\n449\n00:22:58.196 --> 00:23:01.972\nAnd there's so many other\nepisodes in the ITIL MALC series,\n\n450\n00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:05.240\nI wanna make sure you watch\nevery single one of them.\n\n451\n00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.780\nThank you for watching ITProTV,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n452\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.160\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n453\n00:23:12.160 -->

00:00:10.847\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:15.840\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.650\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.520\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n7\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.140\nThis particular episode,\nService Strategy Processes, and\n\n8\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.275\nwho's bringing us this\ninformation is Sherlock Terry.\n\n9\n00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks.\n\n10\n00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Sherlock Holmes Terry.\n\n11\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr.\nWatson, I appreciate that.\n\n12\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Elementary, no, you say that.\n\n13\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.231\nThe investigation continues,\nwe're gonna be looking\n\n15\n00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:43.450\nat the value proposition of each of\nthe five processes in service strategy.\n\n16\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.313\nAnd this is starting a series of episodes\nthat deal with the process focus,\n\n17\n00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:51.490\nif you will, within each of the stages.\n\n18\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.100\nSo service strategy is weighing\nin with five processes,\n\n19\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.240\nwe'll look at each of\nthose five processes.\n\n20\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.269\nAnd the reason why you wanna refocus or\n\n21\n00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.820\nre-energize your understanding of the\nvalue of these processes is cuz when you\n\n22\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080\nare trying to manage across a life cycle,\nyou're either experiencing that value, or\n\n23\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.530\nyou're not experiencing that value.\n\n24\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.898\nSo as you're taking this, operationally\nspeaking, back at the office, you might\n\n25\n00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:17.388\nnot say, we're never gonna have a business\nrelationship management process.\n\n26\n00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:19.505\nOkay, I can accept that on the surface,\n\n27\n00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:24.190\nthat you're not gonna have a process\ncalled business relationship management.\n\n28\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.990\nBut somehow, you are delivering\non the value proposition of what\n\n29\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.660\nBRM is supposed to bring.\n\n30\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.282\nWhether you call it BRM or\nwhether you call it XYZ,\n\n31\n00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:34.975\nthe value preposition must be delivered.\n\n32\n00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:39.204\nSo ITIL is not prescribing to you the way\nyou must manage your relationship with\n\n33\n00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.445\nthe business.\n\n34\n00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.130\nITIL is not that presumptuous.\n\n35\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.300\nBut what they are saying and what they are\nsuggesting and recommending is that you\n\n36\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.630\nunderstand the value of these processes\nand make sure you're realizing that value.\n\n37\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.390\nAnd if you're not,\nyou have an opportunity for improvement.\n\n38\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020\nAs you look at this academically then,\non the exam,\n\n39\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.010\nthat is, as you're taking the exam,\nyou might see a scenario\n\n40\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.140\nbased on the case study that reflects\nthe absence of that value being delivered.\n\n41\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.137\nAnd be able to recognize that\nin the absence of this value,\n\n42\n00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:13.060\nwhat process is going to fill the void.\n\n43\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.800\nThat's the academic challenge here.\n\n44\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.730\nSo that's why re-energizing your awareness\nof the value of each of these processes is\n\n45\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.800\nimportant.\n\n46\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.610\nSo this is not a long episode,\nit's just that attempt to re-energize.\n\n47\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.120\nAnd if you're not effectively\nenergized yet, take that sample paper,\n\n48\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.790\nreview example exam, and you'll find\n\n49\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.810\nhow the questions are based on the\nscenario will re-energize that for you.\n\n50\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.380\nLet's have a look.\n\n51\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.680\nSo, first of all, service strategy,\n\n52\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.210\nlooking at the process called\nstrategy management for IT services.\n\n53\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.550\nIt's a process, it's a process by name.\n\n54\n00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.050\nAnd effectively what this process does,\n\n55\n00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.440\nis provide overarching governance of\nthe stage called service strategy.\n\n56\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.310\nIt's like the mother hand of\nservice strategy, if you will.\n\n57\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.433\nIt makes sure these other processes are\ndone well and are working well together.\n\n58\n00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:06.867\nSo if you wanna pick a different format,\nor\n\n59\n00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.182\nmaybe choose Boss Hog,\nstrategic management for\n\n60\n00:03:10.182 --> 00:03:15.490\nIT services is that process that governs\nthe entire stage call service strategy.\n\n61\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.744\nIn the absence of this, perhaps you'll see\nsymptoms where the processes aren't well\n\n62\n00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:21.211\nintegrated with each other.\n\n63\n00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:25.258\nThat BRM doesn't know what service\nportfolio management's doing,\n\n64\n00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:29.581\nand financial management is not bringing\nenough cost data to the portfolio\n\n65\n00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:30.347\ndecisions.\n\n66\n00:03:30.347 --> 00:03:34.292\nOr demand management is not\neffectively predicting demand, so\n\n67\n00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:38.100\nwe're building services that\naren't ready for prime time.\n\n68\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.400\nBecause we end up with 20,000 users,\ninstead of 4,000.\n\n69\n00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.570\nSo demand management is\nkind of failing you.\n\n70\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.880\nSo in the absence of the value,\nyou're gonna see some symptoms.\n\n71\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.710\nBe able to recognize those symptoms.\n\n72\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.300\nIn the absence of strategy management for\nIT services,\n\n73\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.920\nthe symptoms would be poor integration\namong the processes and service strategy.\n\n74\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.940\nThey don't talk well to each other.\n\n75\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.311\nAnd again, moving forward,\nstrategy management for\n\n76\n00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.824\nIT services must interact\nwith these other process.\n\n77\n00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:08.987\nYou'll see many of them are related\nto service strategy, but of course,\n\n78\n00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:11.542\nsome of them go a little bit different.\n\n79\n00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:14.580\nStrategy management for\nIT services needs to provide interface\n\n80\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.820\nwith knowledge management,\nall the stages have to do that.\n\n81\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.730\nIn fact, as we go through the process\nintegrations and how they work and\n\n82\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.690\nthe value propositions, they are going\nto touch base with knowledge management.\n\n83\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.070\nAll of them are feeding the knowledge\nmanagement system, all of them do.\n\n84\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.278\nStrategy management for\n\n85\n00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.769\nIT services needs to provide\nappropriate handoff to service design.\n\n86\n00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:37.730\nStrategy management for\n\n87\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.962\nIT services are gonna be there to\nsign off on the new charter, etc.\n\n88\n00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:46.790\nStrategy management for IT services is\ngonna interact with service transition.\n\n89\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.960\nAnd service operations to make\nsure that sufficient data and\n\n90\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.850\ninformation is collected from them,\nbefore you decide to to invest\n\n91\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.870\non a new project for a new service,\nas we talked about before.\n\n92\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.422\nAnd of course,\nCSI can always be in play for\n\n93\n00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:07.364\nall services, for\nall stages, all the time.\n\n94\n00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:09.687\nWhat's the value of portfolio management?\n\n95\n00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:14.088\nIf you recall that the service\nportfolio is this deliverable,\n\n96\n00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:17.493\nbut service portfolio\nmanagement is a process,\n\n97\n00:05:17.493 --> 00:05:22.300\none of which outcomes is to\ndeliver the portfolio itself.\n\n98\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.310\nBut service portfolio management\nis not just the process\n\n99\n00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.140\nthat generates this deliverable called the\nportfolio, which consists of a pipeline,\n\n100\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.210\nthe service catalog, and retired services.\n\n101\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.880\nCertainly, portfolio management\nis governing that tool.\n\n102\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.650\nBut service portfolio management is\nactually governing and processing,\n\n103\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.030\nif you will, the movement of a given\nservice through those various milestones\n\n104\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.470\nof an idea into operations,\n\n105\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.290\ninto retired services, the pipeline,\nthe catalog, retired services.\n\n106\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.660\nPortfolio management is the process\nthat shepherds the service\n\n107\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.170\nthroughout its life cycle.\n\n108\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.070\nTherefore gonna be involved\nthroughout its life cycle.\n\n109\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.330\nSo while its primary\npurpose is a strategic one,\n\n110\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.930\nservice portfolio management is\ngoing to deliver strategic value\n\n111\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.580\nto the stage called service strategy.\n\n112\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.120\nIt doesn't die there.\n\n113\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.960\nIt's born there, but\nit lives on throughout the life cycle\n\n114\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.070\nof a service to make sure that business\noutcomes are continually being met.\n\n115\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.320\nThat the right investment is made for\nthese services, and\n\n116\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.890\nthat ultimately, the customer has the\nright services in place at the right time.\n\n117\n00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.250\nSo, it's gonna be interacting with the\nprocess called service catalog management\n\n118\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.280\nfor sure,\nthat happens to happen in design.\n\n119\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.250\nThat's one part of the portfolio.\n\n120\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.758\nIt's gonna be interacting with financial\nmanagement to make sure there's\n\n121\n00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:48.278\na sufficient data regarding the cost\nof the service to make a wise decision.\n\n122\n00:06:48.278 --> 00:06:51.530\nI mean it's one thing to say yeah,\nwe'd like that service.\n\n123\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.978\nIt's another thing to say,\nlet's invest $3 million in that service.\n\n124\n00:06:54.978 --> 00:06:56.783\nWait a minute, we don't have $3 million.\n\n125\n00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.166\nHow else can we get there?\n\n126\n00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:01.270\nWe're operating under those constraints,\nas well.\n\n127\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.000\nPlaying out with information security,\n\n128\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.840\nthat you're not violating your security\nprinciples by introducing new services.\n\n129\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.840\nCapacity and availability,\nare you building it to the appropriate\n\n130\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.590\nspecifications for\ncapacity and availability?\n\n131\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.760\nPortfolio management can\nhelp with that decision, and\n\n132\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.270\nof course, the other warranty processes\nalso played out there with continuity.\n\n133\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.320\nIn a nutshell, what you're talking about\nhere is, you're going to be investing in\n\n134\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.258\na new service, what's it gonna cost,\nand how resilient must it be.\n\n135\n00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:32.580\nPortfolio management's gonna have\nthose points of interaction.\n\n136\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.880\nNow financial management for IT services,\nagain, it happens to be a strategic asset.\n\n137\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.210\nIt's in service strategy, and it certainly\ndoes play in to strategic decisions.\n\n138\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.480\nKnowing how much money you have,\n\n139\n00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.900\nhow much money you are willing to spend is\ngonna be delivered through good reasonable\n\n140\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.250\nevaluation of the information that\nyou have at your beck and call.\n\n141\n00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.070\nSo financial management for IT service is\ntrying to make that information available,\n\n142\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.330\nso that wise decisions could be made for\ninvestment into services.\n\n143\n00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.040\nIf you want to adopt IT\nservice management and\n\n144\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.660\none of the goals is to adopt\nan integrated tool set,\n\n145\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.340\na suite of applications that help you with\nIT service management, what's it cost?\n\n146\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.750\nFinancial management\ncan help you with that.\n\n147\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.690\nWhat's the value proposition, is gonna be\nbrought to that same kind of question.\n\n148\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.270\nSo now you can do a cost\nversus benefit analysis.\n\n149\n00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.160\nWithout the cost being identified,\n\n150\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.990\nhow can you make a wise decision\nabout cost versus benefit?\n\n151\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.320\nUltimately though, financial management\nis also in play, through design.\n\n152\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.120\nWhat does it cost to design services?\n\n153\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.220\nWhat's it cost to transition services?\n\n154\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.530\nWhat's it cost to operate services?\n\n155\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.822\nFinancial management is there for\nthose kinds of answers too.\n\n156\n00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:50.580\nSo it's trying to help with your\ndecision to bring in a new service.\n\n157\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.350\nWhat's it gonna cost to bring it to life?\n\n158\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.799\nBut also, what does it cost to operate?\n\n159\n00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:01.668\nPerhaps, I know in my own experience,\nI've been involved with projects that\n\n160\n00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:06.980\ndelivered a solution on time and\non budget, and got pretty good at that.\n\n161\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.400\nIf there were a few things broken, that's\nokay, we'll fix it on the other side.\n\n162\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.870\nThat was the basic mentality,\nwhich is not bad, necessarily.\n\n163\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.420\nBut what about ongoing costs, license\nrenewal, ongoing maintenance contracts,\n\n164\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.970\nthose kinds of things.\n\n165\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.730\nWas that built into the project budget?\n\n166\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.802\nWas it somehow accommodated in\nthe operational budget or capital budget?\n\n167\n00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:31.224\nFinancial management's gonna be there\nto help you govern those kind of\n\n168\n00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:34.590\nfactors to make sure the right\nquestions are asked at the right time.\n\n169\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.366\nAnd therefore, no big surprises later\nwhen you need to renew the license and\n\n170\n00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:40.973\ndon't have the money for\nthem, that sort of thing.\n\n171\n00:09:40.973 --> 00:09:43.100\nSo, cost, risk, value,\n\n172\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:49.650\nfinancial management can help you\nwith that cost side of the situation.\n\n173\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.150\n&gt;&gt; Great job.\n\n174\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Now, demand management,\ndemand management, again,\n\n175\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.990\nbeing able to predict demand, so\n\n176\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.450\nthat you design the appropriate capacity,\nis one aspect of demand management.\n\n177\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.150\nIf you're anticipating 5,000 users and\n\n178\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.135\ndemand management can discern that their\npatterns of business activity will suggest\n\n179\n00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:15.820\nthat 2,000 to be concurrent\nat any given time.\n\n180\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.176\nYou understand the patterns of business\nactivity sufficiently enough to make\n\n181\n00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:21.890\na wise prediction of use.\n\n182\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.580\nThen obviously,\n\n183\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.190\nwhen you get down to the design phase, you\ncan build more appropriately the capacity.\n\n184\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.639\nYou can build it in.\n\n185\n00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:32.941\nNow demand management, so it's trying to\nbe predictive of what demand is there, so\n\n186\n00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:35.810\nyou can build the appropriate capacity.\n\n187\n00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.928\nBut it's even more strategic than that.\n\n188\n00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:41.677\nDemand management can be there to say or\nto ask and then answer,\n\n189\n00:10:41.677 --> 00:10:46.580\nis there going to be sufficient demand\nthat warrants investment in this service?\n\n190\n00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.600\nSo this really means you're gonna be\nengaging with the business somewhat.\n\n191\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.660\nMaybe through BRM, business relationship\nmanagement, the key strategic process.\n\n192\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.720\nAs you work with BRM to\ndiscern potential demand for\n\n193\n00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.360\na service you're considering, demand\nmanagement can be there to maybe discern,\n\n194\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.130\nyou know what,\nthey're not gonna need this.\n\n195\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.090\nThey can go to this service\nprovider already and get it for\n\n196\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.750\nhalf the price that we could build it.\n\n197\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.260\nLet's just make sure we build\nan appropriate interface\n\n198\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.761\nto that external service and\nnot even build this ourselves.\n\n199\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.040\nSo again, demand management can\nbe there to nix a decision,\n\n200\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.430\nnot just to justify a decision for\nnew investment.\n\n201\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.500\nIt can be there to say you know what,\n\n202\n00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.018\nthere's not gonna be enough demand\nhere let's not do this service.\n\n203\n00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:37.380\nOr that can be better met more\neffectively over here instead of by us.\n\n204\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.540\nSo while it's attempted to be predictive,\n\n205\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.590\nso that you can effectively budget toward\nappropriate capacity for something\n\n206\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.090\nyou wanna build, it can also be predictive\nto say, let's not even build this.\n\n207\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.290\nWe've got this demand met by other means.\n\n208\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.920\nSo demand management is critical there.\n\n209\n00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.985\nAnd I've already introduced BRM,\nanother of the five end service strategy.\n\n210\n00:11:56.985 --> 00:12:02.430\nWe talked about it earlier as the fulcrum\nfor all communications with the business.\n\n211\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.045\nIt's where the rubber meets the road,\nso to speak,\n\n212\n00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:07.314\nis with business relationship management.\n\n213\n00:12:07.314 --> 00:12:12.570\nAmong all the processes in ITIL, this one\nis distinguishable in this characteristic.\n\n214\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.652\nIt's probably not really a starting\npoint and an ending point.\n\n215\n00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:24.760\nBRM is always active,\nit's also probably the least siloed.\n\n216\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.810\nAnd by that, I mean financial\nmanagement has a very specific scope\n\n217\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.010\nrelated to money and cost factors.\n\n218\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.020\nPortfolio has a very specific scope,\nrelated to evaluating\n\n219\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.461\nthe portfolio to make sure the right\nmix of services are involved.\n\n220\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.640\nDemand management has a very specific\nsiloed scope referring to demand.\n\n221\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.337\nBut BRM, because it is responsible for\nthe relationship with the business,\n\n222\n00:12:48.337 --> 00:12:51.110\nit's involved everywhere all the time.\n\n223\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.660\nThere's probably not one\npractitioner at any given time,\n\n224\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.603\nthere's probably several practitioners.\n\n225\n00:12:55.603 --> 00:12:59.550\nThink about at your own job site.\n\n226\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.880\nHow many people interact with\nthe customers or with the business?\n\n227\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.480\nHow many people actually have\nconversations with the business\n\n228\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.390\nthat are meaningful operationally,\nstrategically.\n\n229\n00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.540\nThey're happening all\nthe time in different venues.\n\n230\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.010\nThe IT steering committee is getting\ntogether, that's part of BRM.\n\n231\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.160\nYou're doing a service review.\n\n232\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.460\nBack in operations, well,\nhow good your service is doing.\n\n233\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.290\nThat's BRM.\n\n234\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.840\nSo BRM is not really a monolithic process\nwith a starting point and an ending point.\n\n235\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.030\nMore than it is a governance umbrella for\n\n236\n00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.880\nhow we're gonna integrate with\nthe business, at what points?\n\n237\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.423\nHow often do we meet with them?\n\n238\n00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:41.420\nAt what levels do we speak, at what time?\n\n239\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.610\nWhich strategic meetings do we have?\n\n240\n00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.610\nWhich tactical meetings do we have?\n\n241\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.840\nWhich operational meetings do we have?\n\n242\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.800\nBRM is kinda the umbrella.\n\n243\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.940\nSo unlike the other processes with a kind\nof narrow scope, BRM is rather broad,\n\n244\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.780\na big umbrella under which there\ncould be many practitioners.\n\n245\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.688\nTake, for instance,\nthe service owner role,\n\n246\n00:14:00.688 --> 00:14:05.137\nthe service owner role is responsible for\nthe quality of their service.\n\n247\n00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:08.631\nThey are gonna be there at service\nmeetings, service review meetings, and\n\n248\n00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:12.120\nthey could be their strategic meetings for\nnew directions.\n\n249\n00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.780\nThis is a service owner, so in effect,\na service owner is a practitioner\n\n250\n00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.879\nof BRM because they're involved in\nthe relationship with the business.\n\n251\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.830\nTake the process called\nservice level management.\n\n252\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.710\nLet's say you are a service level manager\nconducting service review meetings.\n\n253\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.660\nYou are integrating with\nthe business at that point.\n\n254\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.840\nYou are talking with the business.\n\n255\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.960\nThey're coming to the review meeting,\nyou're leading the meeting,\n\n256\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.310\nyou're taking notes,\nyou're assigning actions for improvement.\n\n257\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.970\nIn that particular context,\n\n258\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.210\nyou are involved in the business\nrelationship management.\n\n259\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.540\nSo you're a practitioner\nof this umbrella process.\n\n260\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.040\nSo, even though SLM as a process\nis well defined and the roles and\n\n261\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.630\nresponsibilities of a service\nowner are well defined,\n\n262\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.990\nthere's obviously points\nof interaction among those.\n\n263\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.580\nWhere these particular roles and these\nparticular people become practitioners of\n\n264\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.420\nthis big umbrella called business\nrelationship management, a big one.\n\n265\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.302\nSo I don't think I could overstate.\n\n266\n00:15:09.302 --> 00:15:10.968\nThis is a probably a limited list,\n\n267\n00:15:10.968 --> 00:15:15.171\ntherefore BRM certainly interacts with\nthese other processes, without a question.\n\n268\n00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:19.840\nThey see the spider web areas going out\nand touching lots of different things.\n\n269\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.890\nIt'd be hard for me to limit BRM cuz it\nwould be involved at just about any level.\n\n270\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:31.500\nIf the customers are upset with change\nmanagement because they're always late, or\n\n271\n00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.520\nthey might deliver on time, but when they\ndeliver something, it's always broken.\n\n272\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.963\nSo the business could be very upset\nwith our change management process.\n\n273\n00:15:39.963 --> 00:15:41.960\nTherefore, you could put\nchange management up here.\n\n274\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.930\nYou could look at put BRM and\nchange management\n\n275\n00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.210\nin the same list to say they talk\nto each other, they certainly can.\n\n276\n00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.902\nSo because BRM is more of an umbrella and\nbecause it's really more like a spider web\n\n277\n00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:57.710\nthat gets out into everything,\nI don't want you to think that this\n\n278\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.669\nparticular process is anywhere\nclose to being monolithic.\n\n279\n00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:06.095\nIt is not, there is not one practitioner\nand one best way to do this.\n\n280\n00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.709\nSo when you're considering how you're\ntrying to capture the value of BRM,\n\n281\n00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:18.121\nwhat is the value of BRM as related to\nSLM, or as related to demand management,\n\n282\n00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:21.170\nor as relates to availability management?\n\n283\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.977\nBRM gives you a structured approach,\na structured set of activities.\n\n284\n00:16:24.977 --> 00:16:27.190\nThat's what a process is.\n\n285\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.342\nIt gives you a structured\nset of activities toward\n\n286\n00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:32.297\na specific business outcome.\n\n287\n00:16:32.297 --> 00:16:37.159\nOr a specific deliverable, in this case,\nthat outcome is effective manager of\n\n288\n00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:41.090\ncustomer expectations and\nvalue propositions, straight up.\n\n289\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.530\nThat's it with the service\nstrategy processes.\n\n290\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.800\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we got, yep.\n\n291\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, any kind of a wrap up on this or?\n\n292\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.912\n&gt;&gt; No, actually not this time.\n\n293\n00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:49.655\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n294\n00:16:49.655 --> 00:16:51.451\n&gt;&gt; There's no specific\nexercise related to this.\n\n295\n00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:55.070\nYou'll certainly find this tested\nthrough the sample papers.\n\n296\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.480\nYou'll find this reinforced\nin the sample papers, so,\n\n297\n00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.730\nas I mentioned before, the importance of\nthose sample papers cannot be overstated.\n\n298\n00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.920\nMake sure you take some practice exams\nbefore you get out there to the real exam.\n\n299\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.000\nAnd you'll get to hone your skills\non those particular topics there.\n\n300\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it,\nITIL MALC service strategy processes.\n\n301\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.870\nGreat job as usual, Terry.\n\n302\n00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.550\nThanks very much.\n\n303\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.270\nAnd there's so\nmuch more in the ITIL MALC series.\n\n304\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.876\nHey, thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n305\n00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:24.480\nA good IT pro is always learning.\n\n306\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.190\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n307\n00:17:25.190 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.610\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.240\n&gt;&gt; Hello again,\n\n7\n00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.230\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.620\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas continue on with ITIL MALC,\n\n9\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.100\nand this look is gonna be\nservice design processes.\n\n10\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.080\nAnd giving us all the information we need,\nis Terry Decker, right over here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.790\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.060\nAnd as Zach mentioned, we're gonna be\nlooking at the service design processes.\n\n13\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.370\nThese processes,\n\n14\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.410\nas we did with service strategy in\na previous episode are they have value.\n\n15\n00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.740\nAnd in the absence of a given process,\nyou could be missing that value.\n\n16\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.570\nThat's the value proposition,\nif you will, of IT service management.\n\n17\n00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.230\nITIL defines 26 processes,\n\n18\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.950\nsuggesting that these 26 processes,\nif done well, will deliver value.\n\n19\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.000\nSo, what if that value is missing, right?\n\n20\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.770\nWhat are the symptoms\nof that value missing?\n\n21\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.460\nSo as we go through this lecture,\nI would like for\n\n22\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.930\nyou to be thinking or re-energizing your\nawareness of the value of these processes.\n\n23\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.234\nThis won't be the first time that\nyou've been exposed to them.\n\n24\n00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:15.540\nI know you got a little bit of them in,\ncertainly in foundation course, and\n\n25\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.903\nyou would've touched some\nof them at a deeper level,\n\n26\n00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:19.919\nand the intermediate path if you've taken.\n\n27\n00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:24.311\nBut what we're focusing on here and\nwe're trying to refocus on the value\n\n28\n00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:28.775\nproposition, is because when your\ntrying to manage across a life cycle,\n\n29\n00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:31.350\nyou could get lost in the trees, right.\n\n30\n00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.370\nYou're not necessarily see the forest.\n\n31\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.270\nSo what we're trying to do at managing\nacross a life cycle, is get you keen\n\n32\n00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.155\non finding where value is missing\nin this process model called ITIL.\n\n33\n00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:49.100\nSo if there is a particular weakness\nsuggested in a scenario on the exam,\n\n34\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.680\nif there's a particular weakness,\nactually,\n\n35\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.590\nin the case study, there's something is\nshown to be a little bit of a shortfall.\n\n36\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.430\nYou don't have this process formalized, or\n\n37\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.840\nyou don't have this\nprocess formalized yet.\n\n38\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.099\nThat might play out in a scenario,\nit might play out in the case study.\n\n39\n00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.554\nBut if this is not formalized,\nyou can kinda be keening in on, or\n\n40\n00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:12.580\nzeroing in on, is there gonna be\na manifestation of that being missing?\n\n41\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.890\nAnd that's gonna be is the value missing,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.060\nSo understanding what these\nprocesses do is one thing.\n\n43\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.390\nUnderstanding why that's\nimportant is another.\n\n44\n00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.620\nAnd when you consider\nmanaging across a life cycle,\n\n45\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.280\nit's as important enough to\nknow why as it is to how.\n\n46\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.740\nSo let's take a look at the why's here.\n\n47\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.410\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n48\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, there are eight\nprocesses in service design.\n\n49\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.760\nI'm gonna fast forward\nthis really quickly,\n\n50\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.800\ncuz many of these are located here.\n\n51\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.340\nDesign coordination, I'll go back and pick\nup some of the pieces here in a second.\n\n52\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.970\nBut design coordination, among the others\nthat are in service design are service\n\n53\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.520\nlevel management, supplier management,\navailability, capacity, and\n\n54\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.750\nIT service continuity management.\n\n55\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.510\nSo, a bunch of warranty processes here,\nright.\n\n56\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.380\nThe one missing is security management.\n\n57\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.721\nIt also could be in play, right?\n\n58\n00:03:03.114 --> 00:03:08.540\nSo these are within service design.\n\n59\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.110\nNotice these other process integration,\nas you go around the bend, right.\n\n60\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.420\nSo design coordination, obviously,\n\n61\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.070\nintends to have conversations outside\nof service design, to be successful.\n\n62\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.720\nThis is reinforcing what we've talked\nabout earlier, as these stages don't\n\n63\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.230\ninteract in a vacuum, I mean,\nthey don't exist in a vacuum.\n\n64\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.740\nThey interact with each other, and\n\n65\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.390\nto be successful, they have to know\nwhat the other ones are doing.\n\n66\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.400\nWhen you're trying to successfully\nmanage across a life cycle,\n\n67\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.610\nyou're often gonna be looking at\nthe interactions among these stages, and\n\n68\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.390\nthe interactions among these processes.\n\n69\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.710\nSo what about design coordination?\n\n70\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.517\nGoing back up a step here.\n\n71\n00:03:47.517 --> 00:03:51.970\nDesign coordination delivers\nvalue to business because it is\n\n72\n00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.882\nthe process that effectively governs,\n\n73\n00:03:54.882 --> 00:04:01.310\nthat intends to effectively govern\nthe entire stage called service design.\n\n74\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.690\nSo if you understand what service\ndesign is trying to accomplish,\n\n75\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.470\nyou'll find that design coordination is\nat the fulcrum of that value proposition.\n\n76\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.530\nIt's the one that delivers things.\n\n77\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.490\nSo what is service design trying to do?\n\n78\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.040\nIt's trying to answer all\nthe questions that need to be answered\n\n79\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.155\nto eventually successfully\nbring a service to life.\n\n80\n00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:25.715\nNot a system to life,\nnot a solution to life, but a service.\n\n81\n00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:27.835\nWhich means,\nall the trappings of a service,\n\n82\n00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:31.422\nincluding processes,\ntechnology for sure, right?\n\n83\n00:04:31.422 --> 00:04:33.802\nThe people, are they trained,\nare they ready to go?\n\n84\n00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.542\nAre suppliers on board, right?\n\n85\n00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.212\nAre we affecting the right\norganizational structures?\n\n86\n00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:43.361\nOr, are the organizations gonna interface\nwith each other effectively, right?\n\n87\n00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.631\nDo we have metrics in place?\n\n88\n00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:47.781\nWhat does success look like?\n\n89\n00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:50.481\nWhat is the service acceptance criteria?\n\n90\n00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:55.151\nAnswering all the questions before\nyou write that first bit of code, or\n\n91\n00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:57.040\npurchase that first server.\n\n92\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.420\nOr design that first\navailability management plan.\n\n93\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.980\nYou're trying to answer the questions,\nwhat are we trying to get done here?\n\n94\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.010\nSo design coordination,\nnot only answers these questions\n\n95\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.350\nthrough the other seven processes in\nservice design, it makes sure those other\n\n96\n00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.560\nseven processes within service design are\ndone well, at sufficient level of quality.\n\n97\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.490\nThat they're done efficiently and\neffectively, on time and on budget.\n\n98\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.710\nAnd coordinating all the resources,\nmanaging the workflow.\n\n99\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.560\nThere is a high component\nof project management\n\n100\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.440\nexpectations within design coordination.\n\n101\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.610\nAnd it's gonna be the handshake with your\nproject management office, for sure, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.980\nIn the absence of design and coordination,\n\n103\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.050\ncould you still be doing availability\nmanagement, continuity management,\n\n104\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.750\ncapacity management, supplier management,\nservice level management?\n\n105\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.190\nAbsolutely, you could be effectively\ndoing those other processes and\n\n106\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.020\nnot have designed coordination, but\n\n107\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.520\nwhat you'd be missing is the handshake\nwith project management.\n\n108\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.600\nThe coordination of those seven things,\n\n109\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.660\nthe interaction of those seven\nthings that are going on.\n\n110\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.500\nThe appropriate cost justifications and\n\n111\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.420\nimprovement across the life cycle\nstage called service design.\n\n112\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.167\nSo in the absence of design coordination,\nthe value you'd be missing would\n\n113\n00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:15.357\nbe a holistic approach to\nall design activities and\n\n114\n00:06:15.357 --> 00:06:18.791\nholistic approach to improving them all,\nall right.\n\n115\n00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n116\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.160\n&gt;&gt; That's design coordination.\n\n117\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.690\n&gt;&gt; Another process within service design,\nservice catalog management.\n\n119\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.430\nYou'll recall that service catalog\nmanagement is responsible for\n\n120\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.130\nmaintaining the service catalog.\n\n121\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.600\nThis listing of all your\noperational services,\n\n122\n00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.420\nthe ones that are currently active.\n\n123\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.316\nAnd keeping up with details of\nthose operational services, and\n\n124\n00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:45.164\nproviding the appropriate views of\nthe services to be appropriate audiences.\n\n125\n00:06:45.164 --> 00:06:48.840\nThat's what service service\ncatalog management purpose is.\n\n126\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.630\nBut what's the value of it?\n\n127\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.701\nRight, why have a listing\nof your existing services.\n\n128\n00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:58.237\nRight, let me put it in another way.\n\n129\n00:06:58.237 --> 00:07:01.645\nIf you want to adopt\nIT service management,\n\n130\n00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:05.155\nyou need to identify\nwhat your services are.\n\n131\n00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:13.110\nIn the absence of service definition,\nyou can't manage services.\n\n132\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.900\nYou're chasing solutions,\nyou're chasing phantoms,right,\n\n133\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.725\nyou're chasing something\nthat's not service-oriented.\n\n134\n00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:22.730\nYou're just chasing\ntechnology around the bend.\n\n135\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.088\nRight, service management\nrequires services to be defined.\n\n136\n00:07:28.876 --> 00:07:30.955\nOnce defined, they need to be reposited,\n\n137\n00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:34.830\nthey need to be in a place where we\ncan see them and talk about them.\n\n138\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.790\nThat's what the catalog is.\n\n139\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.830\nIf you've never began this sort\nof catalog management process,\n\n140\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.430\nthen the first stage is having\na conversation about what a service is.\n\n141\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.300\nMaking sure you get a common\nunderstanding across your organization\n\n142\n00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.870\nwhat a service is.\n\n143\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.320\nAnd I say this operationally speaking,\nthis also could play out on the exam,\n\n144\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.316\nright, academically speaking.\n\n145\n00:07:55.316 --> 00:08:00.244\nIn the absence of a service catalog, how\ndo you articulate what services you have?\n\n146\n00:08:00.244 --> 00:08:04.577\nHow do you begin to have a conversation\nabout services without listing what\n\n147\n00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:05.826\nservices you offer.\n\n148\n00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:09.932\nSo the service catalog is providing\nvalue by providing a single point of\n\n149\n00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:12.960\ntruth about your existing services.\n\n150\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.820\nAnd with that you could then launch into\nyour ideas about service management.\n\n151\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.910\nIt's kind of a predicate step.\n\n152\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.940\nNow this doesn't have to be complicated,\nlet me put it another way.\n\n153\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.420\nEventually it can become quite complex.\n\n154\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.740\nIn fact, building out your\ncatalog with multiple views for\n\n155\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.220\nall your different kinds of customers,\ncould be a data model challenge.\n\n156\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.660\nHow are we going to put this data in a,\nis it gonna be a spreadsheet?\n\n157\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.100\nA SharePoint list?\n\n158\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.530\nDoes it need to be a relational database?\n\n159\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.380\nYou'll eventually get to\nthat kind of conversation.\n\n160\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.600\nItell is not trying to ask\nyou to solve the data model\n\n161\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.860\nchallenge of service catalog, I promise.\n\n162\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.610\nOn the exam you're not going to be asked,\nwork out the date model for\n\n163\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.452\nyour service catalog.\n\n164\n00:08:50.452 --> 00:08:52.150\nYou don't have to go there.\n\n165\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.140\nOperationally speaking, if I were to\nchallenge you to go back to work, and\n\n166\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.810\nbegin to create a catalog, I wouldn't\nget out my relational database guru,\n\n167\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.920\nor talk to a database engineer.\n\n168\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.560\nI'd talk to people in the business.\n\n169\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.190\nI would talk to the practitioners\nin your architectural group and\n\n170\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.130\nyour application group,\nto find out how are these things consumed.\n\n171\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.310\nWho is responsible or accountable?\n\n172\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.760\nFor that application.\n\n173\n00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.800\nWho is responsible and\naccountable for that infrastructure.\n\n174\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.882\nAnd you start building some\nconsensus over, well that's a thing.\n\n175\n00:09:23.882 --> 00:09:24.510\nRight?\n\n176\n00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.640\nJimmy's responsible for servers,\nMary is responsible for\n\n177\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.510\nlearning management applications.\n\n178\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.098\nWhy don't we come up with a service\ncalled learning management and\n\n179\n00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:34.850\nget Mary the service owner.\n\n180\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.140\nWhy don't we come up with a server or\na service called server services.\n\n181\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.180\nAnd let Jimmy be the owner of that,\nyou start developing these things, right?\n\n182\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.030\nHave those kind of conversations and maybe\nthis is an Excel spreadsheet at first.\n\n183\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.800\nRight?\nThat is a very good starting point.\n\n184\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.940\nDon't worry about the data\nmodel on the exam.\n\n185\n00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.640\nAnd don't get lost in the data\nmodel back at the office.\n\n186\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.540\nStart somewhere, get this conversation\ngoing about what is a service and\n\n187\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.940\nstart listing them.\n\n188\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.250\nYou'll get a catalog.\n\n189\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.930\nThat's kind of the value of\nthe service catalog, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.859\nService Level Management,\n\n191\n00:10:11.859 --> 00:10:15.420\nyou remember some of the purposes\nof Service Level Management.\n\n192\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.300\nThere's lots of verbs in\nService Level Management.\n\n193\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.914\nDefine what success looks like, define it.\n\n194\n00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:25.630\nDocument it,\ndocument what success looks like.\n\n195\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.148\nAgree.\n\n196\n00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:29.401\nBroker the agreement.\n\n197\n00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.370\nSo let's just talk about success.\n\n198\n00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.040\nLet's talk about success,\nabout one metric.\n\n199\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.120\nHow available it is.\n\n200\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.070\nLet's say that's one of\nthe targets you want to chase.\n\n201\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.150\nService level management is gonna\nchase availability metrics.\n\n202\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.680\nSo what does success look like?\n\n203\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.924\nSuccess looks like 99% availability.\n\n204\n00:10:47.924 --> 00:10:52.380\nNot 99.999 not 99.8, just 99%.\n\n205\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.520\nThat's what success looks like.\n\n206\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.080\nSLM was there to define the 99%.\n\n207\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.350\nThey wrote it down.\n\n208\n00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.930\nIt's gonna be 99%,\n\n209\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.760\nand they got the customer to sign off\nwe're gonna deliver at 99% availability.\n\n210\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.550\nThat's kinda what happens\nin service design, right?\n\n211\n00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.130\nAnd then after, I'm sorry, it's SLM.\n\n212\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.420\nAnd then after that, service level\nmanagement is available in operations.\n\n213\n00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.190\nWe're measuring availability.\n\n214\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.930\nSo we're monitoring, and measuring,\nand we're keeping score, and\n\n215\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.190\nwe're putting this information in\na useable format, in a usable report.\n\n216\n00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.990\nAnd we're presenting that\nreport to the customer.\n\n217\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.360\nSo, 18 months ago we started off on\na project to bring in a new service and\n\n218\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.590\nduring that design, SLM was there to get\nthe customer to agree to 99% availability.\n\n219\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.930\n18 months later, we're in operations and\nwe're starting to keep score and\n\n220\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.680\nwe're weighing in at 98% availability.\n\n221\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.849\nWe're not meeting our target.\n\n222\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.580\nJust as a thumbnail example of\nhow service level management\n\n223\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.140\nis born in service design but lives\non through later on at the operations\n\n224\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.790\nto make sure that the actual\ntargets are being met.\n\n225\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.180\nAnd of course there's\nperhaps more than one target.\n\n226\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.530\nHow fast does your service desk respond,\nhow quickly do they resolve tickets?\n\n227\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.590\nWhatever it might be,\n\n228\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.820\nyou come up with your metrics that\ndefine what success looks like.\n\n229\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.810\nAnd you get the customers to agree,\nI like that.\n\n230\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.370\nIt's very objective driven,\nit's not opinions, right?\n\n231\n00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.110\nMaybe there's a thing about speed.\n\n232\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.340\nA user says it's slow, but what's slow?\n\n233\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.870\nIf the login takes more than 15 seconds,\nit's slow.\n\n234\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.500\nOkay, let's agree to that one.\n\n235\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.030\nLogins will take less than 15 seconds.\n\n236\n00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.540\nWrite that in your\nservice level agreement.\n\n237\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.390\nAnd start monitoring on the other side, in\noperations, measure the speed of logins so\n\n238\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.270\nthat you can report\nback to them whether or\n\n239\n00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.240\nnot you're achieving that success, right?\n\n240\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.500\nSo that is what SLM is doing.\n\n241\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.090\nIn the absence of SLM, right,\nwhat's the value proposition?\n\n242\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.440\nAs you're looking at it operationally\nspeaking, back at the office, or\n\n243\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.490\nlooking at it on an exam, in the absence\nof a robust service level management\n\n244\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.020\nprocess, you could be\ndealing with opinions.\n\n245\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.690\nSomeone calls and says it's slow.\n\n246\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.970\n15 people call and say it's slow.\n\n247\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.140\nAnd you say my gosh, it's slow.\n\n248\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.900\nLet's redesign this thing,\nlet's get more servers involved,\n\n249\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.300\nlet's increase the bandwidth\nat the network, etc.\n\n250\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.500\nI mean, you might overreact, right?\n\n251\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.310\nAnd actually that was only anecdotal.\n\n252\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.880\n15 people called and said it was slow, you\nnever took the first measurement, right.\n\n253\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.640\nSo now you're responding to opinion and\nsubjectivity instead of data and\n\n254\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.830\nobjectivity.\n\n255\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.290\nSo, service level management\ncan help you not only build\n\n256\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.240\nthe expectations appropriate with\nthe business, appropriate expectations.\n\n257\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.310\nWe're gonna define slow as 15 seconds,\nnot when Johnny calls and says it's slow.\n\n258\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.410\nYou just getting a little\nbit difference there.\n\n259\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.740\nIn the absence of SLM the value\nyou're missing is objective targets.\n\n260\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.570\nNow SLM might be in play, but\nyou don't have effective measurements.\n\n261\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.890\nSo now you've got to champion your SLM\nregime by building a capability for\n\n262\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.310\nbetter measurements.\n\n263\n00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.580\nRight?\nThat also could play out operationally.\n\n264\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.150\nYou got the right idea,\nSLM wants to get things agreed.\n\n265\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.390\nWe agreed that logins will be fast.\n\n266\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.710\nWell, I'm glad you agreed to it,\nhow are we gonna measure it?\n\n267\n00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.040\nWe have no idea.\n\n268\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.430\nSo now you're listening to Johnny call and\n\n269\n00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.460\nsay it's slow again because\nyou don't have the data.\n\n270\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.260\nSo again, SLM,\n\n271\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.190\ntrying to drive an objective approach\nto measuring the success of a service.\n\n272\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.820\nIn the absence of SLM,\n\n273\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.820\nyou could be missing out on\nthe value proposition of SLM.\n\n274\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.010\nLooking at some of the interfaces\nthat the might have you look at here.\n\n275\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.730\nService Level Management absolutely could\nbe involved in every single process\n\n276\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.200\nbecause every single\nprocess could be measured.\n\n277\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.729\nThere could be a target for cost.\n\n278\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:00.180\nThe customers may say, we want you\nto deliver 99% this year and next\n\n279\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.206\nyear we want 15% savings on delivering\nthat particular availability metric.\n\n280\n00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:09.810\nSo you need to now start measuring\nsome financial data in year two.\n\n281\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.970\nThat sort of thing.\n\n282\n00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.250\nSo because service level management can\nabsolutely touch any given process,\n\n283\n00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.350\nthis list is neither exhaustive or\nfully illustrative of\n\n284\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.100\njust how much service level management can\nbe embedded into your operational success.\n\n285\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.370\nNow, the golden goose if you will,\nof many metrics is availability.\n\n286\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.710\nI kind of started with that one.\n\n287\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.830\nIf you've got great functionality, great\nutility, you got really good security,\n\n288\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.810\nyou got plenty of capacity built into it,\nyou got continuity plans in place.\n\n289\n00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:48.020\nAnd yet the thing falls over everyday, the\nthing, the service just fails everyday.\n\n290\n00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.680\nRight.\nIf it falls over everyday You're gonna be\n\n291\n00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.150\nupsetting customers, right?\n\n292\n00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.952\nAvailability is just one of those aspects\nthat need to be covered, and covered well.\n\n293\n00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:01.877\nMaybe the lack of capacity\naffects availability.\n\n294\n00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:04.693\nMaybe the lack of continuity\naffects availability.\n\n295\n00:16:04.693 --> 00:16:07.098\nMaybe the lack of security\naffects availability.\n\n296\n00:16:07.098 --> 00:16:12.530\nSo those Other warranty processes could\nbe a reason why availability fails.\n\n297\n00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.110\nBut availability is what the customers\nabsolutely see every time.\n\n298\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.190\nIf that thing's down or\nthey get an error message or\n\n299\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.530\nthey get a bleep service not available at\nthis time, come back later, all right?\n\n300\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.190\nSo, again, depending on the tolerance\nof the customer and expectations of\n\n301\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:33.730\nthe customer, your availability targets\ncould be very high or not so high.\n\n302\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.630\nBut whatever they are, you got to\nmeet those expectations, all right.\n\n303\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.650\nSo availability management one of\nthose kind of golden goose metrics.\n\n304\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.800\nAnd I've already mentioned how\nit can interact with other ones.\n\n305\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.200\nIncident management,\nincident management is responsible for\n\n306\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.590\nrestoring service as quickly as possible.\n\n307\n00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:55.580\nSo if a service falls over,\nthe service desk gets a call, right?\n\n308\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.620\n15 minutes have passed and\n\n309\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.250\nthen the service desk escalates\nit to a problem management team.\n\n310\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.760\nIt goes to the network team,\nit gets passed over to the database team.\n\n311\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.800\nIt gets sent over to the network team\nagain, then back tot he server team, and\n\n312\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.890\nnow you're talking about a four\nhour outage because you're just\n\n313\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.370\nthrowing this thing all\naround the organization.\n\n314\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.870\nThen incident management could be\na factor in your availability management.\n\n315\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:25.360\nSo making sure incident management has a\nbetter troubleshooting checklist or making\n\n316\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.950\nsure there's quick resolution to certain\ntypes of failures, those types of things.\n\n317\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.160\nCould be a big piece of your\navailability management success.\n\n318\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.725\nSure you have a failure, but\nhow quickly do you restore?\n\n319\n00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:38.570\nIncident management is to restore quickly.\n\n320\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.251\nAnd again ,as you see here,\nthere's also continuity, security,\n\n321\n00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:43.970\ncapacity that could be in play.\n\n322\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.370\nAccess management could effect if you\nallow the wrong user onto the network\n\n323\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.380\nwhat havoc they could wring, right.\n\n324\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.200\nSo understanding that you control access\nto these service assets is an important\n\n325\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.710\naspect, potentially for availability,\ntightly linked to security management.\n\n326\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.080\nOf course service level management\nis in play to measure objectively\n\n327\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.730\nhow available we are.\n\n328\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.390\nAnd change management can be there to\neffectively make changes in a real time\n\n329\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:18.930\nenvironment to bring services back to\nlife should they fall over, etc, right.\n\n330\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.300\nValue propositions, capacity management.\n\n331\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.750\nHaving a sufficient capacity,\n\n332\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.770\nI wanna remind you though that capacity\nis not just component capacity.\n\n333\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.950\nCertainly having the right amount of\nservers, having the right amount of\n\n334\n00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.940\nbandwidth on your network, having\nthe right amount of storage space, memory.\n\n335\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.600\nThose types of things are all in\nplay when you talk about capacity.\n\n336\n00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.450\nAnd ITL just simply describes\nthat as component capacity.\n\n337\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.810\nBut in addition to component capacity\nthere's also service capacity.\n\n338\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.930\nAs an example that I've\nmentioned in another episodes,\n\n339\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.430\nwhat if your service requires\nthe users to have headsets or\n\n340\n00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.410\na stylus for their touch screen, right?\n\n341\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:04.050\nYour ability to provide headsets and\nstylus provisions\n\n342\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.380\nare almost as important as the actual\ntechnology in the background, right?\n\n343\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.494\nSo it's one thing one thing to\nhave the component capacity, but\n\n344\n00:19:12.494 --> 00:19:16.070\ndo you have sufficient capacity to leave\nthe headsets on time or to deliver\n\n345\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.435\nthe stylus on time, to provision\nlaptops to people on time, right?\n\n346\n00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:22.053\nDo you have that kind of service capacity?\n\n347\n00:19:22.053 --> 00:19:24.881\nRight, in addition to\ncomponent capacity and\n\n348\n00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:29.676\nservice capacity, capacity management\nalso deals with business capacity.\n\n349\n00:19:29.676 --> 00:19:34.620\nDoes the business have the capacity\nto consume your service, right.\n\n350\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.800\nDo they have the right skill sets,\n\n351\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.920\nthe right numbers of people\nwith the right skill sets, etc?\n\n352\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.160\nAre they effectively trained?\n\n353\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.770\nDo they have the headset they need, right.\n\n354\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:49.770\nHow do you accommodate folks\nwith disabilities potentially.\n\n355\n00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.510\nThose types of things are on\nthe business capacity side of things.\n\n356\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.360\nAnd while you may not be in the sphere of\ncontrol or they may not be in your sphere\n\n357\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.680\nof control, you may not be able\nto control business capacity.\n\n358\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.680\nYou certainly can't ignore it,\nbecause their ability\n\n359\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.610\nto use your service is important\nto the success of your service.\n\n360\n00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.190\nSo in the absence of capacity management,\n\n361\n00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.356\nyou could fail on the proposition\nof having sufficient components.\n\n362\n00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:21.235\nYou could fail on the proposition of\ndelivering sufficient service capacity or\n\n363\n00:20:21.235 --> 00:20:25.190\nyou could fail on your\nanalysis of business capacity.\n\n364\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.230\nI've seen on some academic questions,\ntest takers,\n\n365\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:34.160\nI've seen where capacity management,\nthe value of capacity management was shown\n\n366\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.290\nby the failure to be able to produce\nbusiness capacity understanding.\n\n367\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.090\nYou did not understand the business well\nenough to make a service designed for\n\n368\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.440\nthat particular business.\n\n369\n00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.400\nThe example that I mentioned earlier,\n\n370\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.805\nif you're bringing MRI\nmessaging to the geophysicists.\n\n371\n00:20:50.805 --> 00:20:53.514\nAnd they have no idea\nhow to use the device or\n\n372\n00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:58.407\nto interpret the data in this nice,\nbeautiful, brand new IT service, those\n\n373\n00:20:58.407 --> 00:21:03.606\ngeophysicists don't have the capacity\nto use the new service you've designed,\n\n374\n00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:08.609\nthen your service is gonna lack in\nthe value it's intended to deliver, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:09.705\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n\n376\n00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:11.550\n&gt;&gt; Continuity management.\n\n377\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.240\nMoving through the warranty processes,\nwe got availability, capacity.\n\n378\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.310\nContinuity management is\nasking that question.\n\n379\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.290\nWhat if something fails?\n\n380\n00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.545\nHow quickly can we recover?\n\n381\n00:21:21.545 --> 00:21:24.945\nAnd what's the impact of that\nfailure if we can't, right?\n\n382\n00:21:24.945 --> 00:21:26.952\nSo business impact analysis and\n\n383\n00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:31.566\nrisk management are at the forefront\nof service continuity management.\n\n384\n00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:34.975\nThey're specifically asking\nthe question what if this falls over?\n\n385\n00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:38.705\nWhat's gonna be the business\nimpact to that?\n\n386\n00:21:38.705 --> 00:21:40.055\nAnd if it's gonna be significant,\n\n387\n00:21:40.055 --> 00:21:41.995\nthen we better have another\none ready to go right away.\n\n388\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.800\nWhat's right away?\n\n389\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.010\nIs it a day?\n\n390\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.410\nIs it instantly?\n\n391\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.980\nIs it three days?\n\n392\n00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.090\nThat's what continuity\nmanagement's trying to figure out.\n\n393\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.990\nBased on the business impact,\nhow quickly must we be back in service?\n\n394\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.340\nRight, very risk based approach here.\n\n395\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.950\nIT service continuity is\nalso tightly linked to\n\n396\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.020\nbusiness continuity management plans.\n\n397\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.370\nUnderstanding what the business would\nlose in the absence of something and\n\n398\n00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.680\nasking what IT can do to fill that gap.\n\n399\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.500\nSo if the business were to lose\na factory due to a tornado, comes in and\n\n400\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.790\nwipes out a factory.\n\n401\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.790\nThey may have a business continuity plan\nthat suggests well we'll retrofit these\n\n402\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.980\nother factories and\nregain 50% of production within two weeks.\n\n403\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.065\nAfter that,\nwe're not sure what we're gonna do.\n\n404\n00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:30.440\nBut at least they've got a two week\nplan to regain 50% production,\n\n405\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.750\nthat's the business continuity side.\n\n406\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.770\nWhat's IT's response to that?\n\n407\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.610\nThat's IT service continuity.\n\n408\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.480\nWhat do we have to do to maintain\nservice continuity if that were to\n\n409\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.730\nhappen to the business?\n\n410\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.390\nDo we need to go there and\nhave additional network drops?\n\n411\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.190\nAre the network drops already there?\n\n412\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.820\nAre there servers there?\n\n413\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.200\nWhat do we have to do, right?\n\n414\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.570\nIs there power there, etc.\n\n415\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.460\nAll right.\n\n416\n00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.150\nService continuity,\nin the absence of service continuity,\n\n417\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.510\nwhat you would find is failures, is\na disconnect between business continuity,\n\n418\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.160\nbusiness impact and\nthe architecture of your service.\n\n419\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.930\nThere'd be some sort of\ndisconnect between them.\n\n420\n00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.204\nNow, IT security management.\n\n421\n00:23:13.921 --> 00:23:18.655\nI'm not sure if anyone was affected by the\nrecent outbreak of the malware that hit\n\n422\n00:23:18.655 --> 00:23:20.735\na lot of older operating systems.\n\n423\n00:23:20.735 --> 00:23:24.365\nJust that I think XP was the big\nculprit there, Windows XP.\n\n424\n00:23:24.365 --> 00:23:28.005\nAnd a pretty big hit for\n\n425\n00:23:28.005 --> 00:23:30.965\nthat particular software on that\nparticular operating system.\n\n426\n00:23:30.965 --> 00:23:33.145\nCorrupting data, bringing down systems,\n\n427\n00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:38.175\nand effectively bringing down\nservices in a major way, right?\n\n428\n00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:42.535\nSo that type of thing is what information\nsecurity management is all about,\n\n429\n00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:47.910\nkeeping your systems protected from\nviruses, protected from attacks, right?\n\n430\n00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.034\nMaking sure the right people\nhave access to resources and\n\n431\n00:23:51.034 --> 00:23:52.928\nthe wrong people don't, right?\n\n432\n00:23:52.928 --> 00:23:57.898\nAnd to be able to effectively\nmanage the identities of people so\n\n433\n00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:02.984\nthat you can effectively manage\nrepudiation, etc., right?\n\n434\n00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:06.489\nSo security management,\nin the absence of security management,\n\n435\n00:24:06.489 --> 00:24:08.751\nyou're gonna be Subjected to such risks.\n\n436\n00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:11.189\nSecurity management is trying\nto hole up those risks,\n\n437\n00:24:11.189 --> 00:24:14.114\nsecure those things against attack,\npretty straightforward.\n\n438\n00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:15.221\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n439\n00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:15.922\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n440\n00:24:17.634 --> 00:24:19.758\nFinally, Supplier Management.\n\n441\n00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:25.035\nDealing with your suppliers is a separate\ndiscipline in ITIL's framework,\n\n442\n00:24:25.035 --> 00:24:27.310\nand I think it makes sense.\n\n443\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.102\nNot only do supplier managers have to\nnavigate through their own bureaucracy of\n\n444\n00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:34.738\nyour own organization for procurement and\nperhaps legal considerations.\n\n445\n00:24:34.738 --> 00:24:37.380\nSo you have to deal with\nthese internal processes.\n\n446\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.840\nYou also have to deal with\nthe intricacies of a third party\n\n447\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.645\noutside your organization.\n\n448\n00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:46.665\nIf you're trying to motivate someone\nwithin your organization, you\n\n449\n00:24:46.665 --> 00:24:51.885\nhave the cultural dynamic of, if you don't\ndo this I'm gonna tell your supervisor.\n\n450\n00:24:51.885 --> 00:24:55.015\nAnd you could be disciplined,\nultimately could be fired, all right?\n\n451\n00:24:56.395 --> 00:24:59.843\nWith suppliers, the relationship\nis not cultural, it's legal,\n\n452\n00:24:59.843 --> 00:25:01.424\nyou have a contract with them.\n\n453\n00:25:01.424 --> 00:25:05.377\nNow I'm not saying you don't develop\ncultural synergies, you should, right?\n\n454\n00:25:05.377 --> 00:25:09.027\nBut ultimately, at the end of the day,\nwhat governs the relationship between you\n\n455\n00:25:09.027 --> 00:25:13.427\nand your supplier is a legal agreement,\nall right?\n\n456\n00:25:13.427 --> 00:25:17.147\nThey may operate on a improvement\ncycle that's different than yours,\n\n457\n00:25:17.147 --> 00:25:21.650\nthey may demand money for improvement,\n\n458\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.590\nwhere you kind of expect improvement\ninside, etc., ongoing improvement.\n\n459\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.200\nSo managing the supplier\nis a separate discipline.\n\n460\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.920\nIn the absence of Supplier Management, you\nmight have a lot of misalignment between\n\n461\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.900\nthe effectiveness of your suppliers as it\nrelates to your business outcomes, right?\n\n462\n00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.457\nYou may have been promising the business\nthat you can resolve incidents and\n\n463\n00:25:43.457 --> 00:25:48.087\noutages within four hours and your\nsupplier thinks they have all day because\n\n464\n00:25:48.087 --> 00:25:51.504\nthey recategorize the severity\ndifferent than you do.\n\n465\n00:25:51.504 --> 00:25:55.697\nAnd so all of a sudden you have a supplier\nthat's making your service fail and you\n\n466\n00:25:55.697 --> 00:26:00.570\nhave an explanation to your customer, why\ndidn't you deliver this within four hours?\n\n467\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.480\nIt's taken two days to get my\nservice back, that's unacceptable.\n\n468\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.140\nBack to the supplier again.\n\n469\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.760\nSo in the absence of Supplier Management,\n\n470\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.940\nyou could be spending more\nmoney than you need to, right?\n\n471\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.570\nYou're not synergizing the competitive\nefforts among your different suppliers.\n\n472\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.040\nYou might have a very complex,\n\n473\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.690\nyou might have a lot more\nsuppliers that you need to manage,\n\n474\n00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:24.800\nyou might have 100 different suppliers\nsupplying the same type of service.\n\n475\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.420\nAnd therefore not getting\nthe economies of scale and\n\n476\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.130\nquality that you could engender with\na supply management discipline.\n\n477\n00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.410\nYou might be making poor decisions\nabout whether to outsource something or\n\n478\n00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.910\nkeep it in house.\n\n479\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.097\nSo Supplier Management becomes the focal\npoint for supplier decisions and\n\n480\n00:26:40.097 --> 00:26:44.019\nprovides a repeatable process for\nongoing management of suppliers,\n\n481\n00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:46.427\nthat's the big value proposition there.\n\n482\n00:26:46.427 --> 00:26:49.011\nObtaining value for money, more value for\n\n483\n00:26:49.011 --> 00:26:54.130\nless money eventually is what Supplier\nManagement can deliver for you, all right?\n\n484\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.154\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n485\n00:26:55.154 --> 00:26:58.784\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's it for\nthe Service Design processes,\n\n486\n00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:02.426\nas we look at these processes and\nthe value therein.\n\n487\n00:27:02.426 --> 00:27:03.525\nThat's it.\n\n488\n00:27:03.525 --> 00:27:08.370\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, well, ITIL Service Design\nprocesses and that concludes this episode.\n\n489\n00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.160\nAnd there is a lot of episodes\nin the ITIL MALC library, so\n\n490\n00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.230\nmake sure you catch every\nsingle one of them.\n\n491\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.105\nTerry, once again, marvelous,\nmarvelous information.\n\n492\n00:27:16.105 --> 00:27:17.940\nAnything else you wanna wrap up with or\nno?\n\n493\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.830\n&gt;&gt; That's it for the supply,\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n494\n00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.728\nwe'll take a look at\nService Transition processes.\n\n495\n00:27:21.728 --> 00:27:24.444\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, thank you for\nwatching ITProTV

00:00:08.618\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:12.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITproTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.958\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\njoining us at ITPROTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.839\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.150\nI am your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC and\n\n8\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.190\nwe are looking at service\ntransition processes.\n\n9\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.196\nWith our very own Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:27.030\nTerry, let's get on\nthat ITIL island again.\n\n11\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you very much Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to the island.\n\n13\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed.\n\n14\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.140\nAs Zach mentioned, we're gonna be diving\ninto the service transition processes.\n\n15\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.300\nAnd as we've done for\nthe service strategy, and\n\n16\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.100\nthe service design processes.\n\n17\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.610\nWe're going to be focusing on the value\npropositions each of the processes makes.\n\n18\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.830\nUnderstanding the value that\nthe process brings to the mix\n\n19\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.130\nis a great way to understand how you can\nmanage across the life cycle of a service.\n\n20\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.530\nThe operationally speaking when\nyou get back to the office\n\n21\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.210\nlooking at where you have failings.\n\n22\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750\nYou can look at those failings or\nthose short comings and\n\n23\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.700\nsay, what process will sure that up?\n\n24\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.580\nUnderstanding the value proposition\nof these processes helps you\n\n25\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.980\nidentify where your improvements can come\nthrough the processes themselves and\n\n26\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.930\nthe best practice framework.\n\n27\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.778\nAcademically speaking, on the exam,\nthe same type of thing.\n\n28\n00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:19.200\nYou'll see shortcomings either\ndescribed in the case study or\n\n29\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.860\ndescribed in the scenario and highlighted\nin the answers to the questions.\n\n30\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.230\nWill be those opportunities for\nimprovement.\n\n31\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.120\nPicking the right answer will often be\nbased on your understanding of the value\n\n32\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.870\nproposition these processes bring.\n\n33\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.590\nSo let's dive in to\nthe service transition.\n\n34\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.100\nYou'll see here, we'll start with\nthe mother hen if you will transition\n\n35\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.640\nplanning and support and the value it has.\n\n36\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.170\nJust as design coordination shepherds\nall the resources of service design,\n\n37\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.120\ntransition planning and\n\n38\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.540\nsupport is the process that shepherds all\nthe resources within service transition.\n\n39\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.640\nAnd by shepherding,\nI mean that there arrive on time,\n\n40\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.980\nthat they arrive with good quality and\nthat you continually get better.\n\n41\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.640\nAnd if you continually get better you\nwill be able to take on more work, right?\n\n42\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.750\nAs you can see by the first bullet here,\neffective transition planning and\n\n43\n00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.880\nsupport can significantly improve\na service provider's ability\n\n44\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.560\nto handle high volumes of change and\nreleases for their customers.\n\n45\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.950\nSo, if you get good at this,\nyou can increase scale,\n\n46\n00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.180\nyou can increase volume, and therefore\nsatisfy your customers more quickly and\n\n47\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.910\nmore thoroughly through\nthe transition phase.\n\n48\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.169\nSo you can't overstate that, can overstate\nthat should I say, transition planning and\n\n49\n00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.660\nsupport is going to make service\ntransition as a whole more effective.\n\n50\n00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.520\nAnd because of that, the business can gain\nvalue through higher volume of change and\n\n51\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.550\nhigher quality of change, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.620\nSo speaking to change,\nthe process called Change Management.\n\n53\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.320\nA very authoritative process within\nthe service transition framework\n\n54\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.580\nis the Change Management\nprocess that assesses change\n\n55\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.680\nin terms of risk and benefit.\n\n56\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.680\nAnd makes sure that\nbeneficial changes happen.\n\n57\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.220\nAnd not so\nbeneficial when it's don't, right?\n\n58\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.000\nSo what's the governing\naspect of transition?\n\n59\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000\nAllowing things to happen or nixing them?\n\n60\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.090\nNot allowing authorization.\n\n61\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.150\nSo change management is\nhighly accountable for\n\n62\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.190\nthe quality of introducing\nchange into the environment.\n\n63\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.340\nHighly accountable.\n\n64\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.920\nA little bit later, we'll talk about\nrelease deployment management.\n\n65\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.800\nRelease and deployment management\nis highly responsible.\n\n66\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.560\nThey make sure things get\ndone well on time, etc..\n\n67\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.520\nChange management authorizes\nthose things to happen.\n\n68\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.310\nIt's the gatekeeper, if you will.\n\n69\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.770\nGood gatekeeping means good things happen\nand all bad things get to stay out.\n\n70\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.520\nThat's what change management\nis primarily for, right?\n\n71\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.280\nAs you look here, you change management\ninterfaces with other processes.\n\n72\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.350\nYou'll see that certainly,\n\n73\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.590\nyou're gonna interface with\nthe Configuration Management System,\n\n74\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.820\nor the CMBBS and underneath that.\n\n75\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.620\nThe configuration management system\nis gonna be the repository for\n\n76\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.560\nall your assets that you care about it,\nthat you care about.\n\n77\n00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.670\nAnd that you want to keep\nunder change control.\n\n78\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.010\nSo when you want to create a change\nrecord and have a historical record for\n\n79\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.685\nwhen changes happen to your key assets,\nyour configurable items.\n\n80\n00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:16.796\nYou will store the picker\ninformation within the CMS.\n\n81\n00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:19.465\nWhich is a great place for it, right?\n\n82\n00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:22.610\nAnd also note that this sort of\ngraphic shows that you're showing it.\n\n83\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.160\nAcross the life cycle of any given change.\n\n84\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.780\nYou know when it was approved.\n\n85\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.290\nYou know when it has been tested.\n\n86\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.610\nYou know when it has been deployed, etc..\n\n87\n00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.210\nSo all these different items\ncan come play in there.\n\n88\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.610\nSo service asset configuration management,\n\n89\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.900\nenabling the CMS is obviously a key point\nof interface between change management.\n\n90\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.930\nAnd the rest of the CI's that\nyoure keeping under control.\n\n91\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.380\nWhich is a good Segway to SACM, Service\nAsset and Configuration Management.\n\n92\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.748\nMy goodness, the value of SACM is\nalmost equal to its complexity.\n\n93\n00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:01.830\n[LAUGH] What I mean by that is,\nby gosh it's complex.\n\n94\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.030\nWhat is a CI, is what service asset and\n\n95\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.280\nconfiguration management\nis first answering.\n\n96\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.860\nWhat do we care about\nkeeping under control?\n\n97\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.720\nSACM is determining what we care about?\n\n98\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.470\nDo we care about servers?\n\n99\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.318\nWhen they change,\ndo we gonna keep them under control?\n\n100\n00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:22.040\nWe probably would say yes, do we wanna\nkeep changes to databases under control?\n\n101\n00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.280\nWe care about databases,\n\n102\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.780\nthat's a CI, let's make sure changes for\ndatabases are under control.\n\n103\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.200\nDo we care about network switches?\n\n104\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.698\nDo we care about other components\nin the infrastructure?\n\n105\n00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:36.700\nThe answer might be yes, we want those\nthings under control, let's identify and\n\n106\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.040\nlet's put it into the CMS.\n\n107\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.368\nThat's gonna be unique identifier, let's\ntrack the attributes of those things and\n\n108\n00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:46.780\nmake sure that we keep them\nup to date ongoing, right?\n\n109\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.678\nSo if you have a small organization with.\n\n110\n00:05:49.678 --> 00:05:53.906\nA couple of dozen servers and\na couple of dozen databases perhaps and\n\n111\n00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:56.940\na couple web accelerators here and there.\n\n112\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.020\nAnd a pipeline to the world.\n\n113\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.956\nThen that CMS challenge is not\nnearly as big as operating for\n\n114\n00:06:02.956 --> 00:06:07.762\na multinational with 3,000 servers and\nmultiple links to all kinds\n\n115\n00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:11.877\nof interfaces throughout\nthe interwebs if you well, etc..\n\n116\n00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:15.432\nSo, the complexity of this\nobviously depends on the size of\n\n117\n00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:17.700\ncomplexity organization.\n\n118\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.100\nBut even for small organizations,\nkeeping this data current and\n\n119\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.510\naccurate is a difficult challenge.\n\n120\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.040\nYou have to have good discipline.\n\n121\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.670\nAnd with the bad data could\ncome some bad decisions.\n\n122\n00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.440\nAs an example,\n\n123\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.210\nthese relationships among these different\ncomponents can help you troubleshooting.\n\n124\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.830\nSo if you don't keep that data current,\nyou might be troubleshooting a server\n\n125\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.560\nthat's not even in the service\nchain anymore, right?\n\n126\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.450\nOr if you don't keep it current,\n\n127\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.170\nyou may be working on the wrong server for\nthat matter.\n\n128\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.370\nYou may be trying to update a server\nthat's already been updated.\n\n129\n00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.820\nSo you can waste effort,\nyou can misuse your time,\n\n130\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.900\nif you will, if you don't have good data.\n\n131\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.950\nSo even in smaller organizations,\n\n132\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.678\nmaintaining accurate data ongoing\nis a tough challenge for SACM.\n\n133\n00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:09.410\nSACM gonna identify the CIs and\n\n134\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.410\nhope to govern the ongoing maintenance of\nall the attributes related to the CIs.\n\n135\n00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.570\nAnd also show you\nthe relationship among the CIs,\n\n136\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.880\nwhich is not a trivial matter sometimes.\n\n137\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.310\nAny given component\ncould serve 20 services,\n\n138\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.720\ndepending on where it is\nin the infrastructure.\n\n139\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.712\nThat could be a complex\nstructure to try to show.\n\n140\n00:07:28.712 --> 00:07:31.877\nAnd it may have interdependencies\non three other components you need,\n\n141\n00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:32.730\nalso need to show.\n\n142\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.360\nSometimes they're interdependent.\n\n143\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.905\nThey rely on each other and\nwork in some sort of fail over fashion.\n\n144\n00:07:39.905 --> 00:07:41.152\nHow do you show that kind of relationship?\n\n145\n00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:44.985\nYou get the idea that it's not\nnecessarily a trivial matter.\n\n146\n00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:47.805\nThe value though cannot be overstated.\n\n147\n00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:53.325\nThe value of having awareness over your\nCIs, and keeping them under control.\n\n148\n00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.715\nBecause it helps so many other processes.\n\n149\n00:07:55.715 --> 00:07:59.105\nIt helps financial management, it helps\nchange management, troubleshooting and\n\n150\n00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.275\nproblem management.\n\n151\n00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:02.575\nDoing root cause analysis for instance.\n\n152\n00:08:02.575 --> 00:08:07.740\nIt can help with the analysis of\ncapacity planning, capacity fulfillment,\n\n153\n00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.290\nit can serve with that.\n\n154\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.500\nIt can help with demand management\nsituations, all sorts of things.\n\n155\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.585\nHaving good data about all\nyour CIs can form the baseline\n\n156\n00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:22.415\nof good information management across\nall the stages of a life cycle.\n\n157\n00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:23.685\nSACM is pretty darn important, right?\n\n158\n00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:27.945\n&gt;&gt; So SACM should be right\nthere at the forefront almost?\n\n159\n00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:30.465\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's probably\none of the foundational ones.\n\n160\n00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:31.390\nGetting it right.\n\n161\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.230\nIn the absence of it.\n\n162\n00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.200\nYou'll continue to stub your toe,\nbasically.\n\n163\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.980\nNow, release and deployment,\nclose related to change management.\n\n164\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.630\nIn that change management\nauthorizes things to happen.\n\n165\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.580\nRelease and deployment gets them done.\n\n166\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.796\nSo, for instance, change management\nauthorizes the planning of a release.\n\n167\n00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:51.246\nSo that you can get it\nscheduled correctly and\n\n168\n00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:55.610\nunderstand the complexities both\ntechnically and organizationally.\n\n169\n00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.130\nIs there a big training component?\n\n170\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.320\nIs there a little training component?\n\n171\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.640\nIs there lots of technology\nthat needs to be coordinated?\n\n172\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.210\nDo we have to coordinate across\nmultiple service providers.\n\n173\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.580\nWe got the server team,\nthe database team and\n\n174\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.060\nthe web services team, all have to\ncome together on a given weekend.\n\n175\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.500\nHow can you get those things coordinated?\n\n176\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.850\nSo, the complexity on the technology side,\nthe complexity on the organizational side,\n\n177\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.720\nthe training requirements are all\npart of the planning stage.\n\n178\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.400\nChange management could authorize\nthe due diligence to plan it out, and\n\n179\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.550\nthen later on authorize the building and\n\n180\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.050\ntesting which release and\ndeployment management does.\n\n181\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.400\nThey actually build the components,\n\n182\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.110\nthey build the training plan, they build\nthe test plan, they execute the tests.\n\n183\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.900\nThey make sure that those\nthings are in play, right.\n\n184\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.610\nUltimately, the change management will\nauthorize the deployment saying, yup,\n\n185\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.580\nyou did all the testing.\n\n186\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.620\nWe agree with all of that, we now\nauthorize releasing deployment management\n\n187\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.260\nas a process to go ahead and deploy\nthis into the production environment.\n\n188\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.020\nAnd then, there's some sort of\nfollow-through at the other side.\n\n189\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.960\nIn the absence of a regimented\napproach to these specific activities\n\n190\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.281\nof approve a planning, building, testing,\n\n191\n00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:09.724\ndeployment, and closure in\nthe absence of a methodical way.\n\n192\n00:10:09.724 --> 00:10:12.127\nYou're just kind of swimming\nalong inefficiently.\n\n193\n00:10:12.127 --> 00:10:16.079\nHaving a release and deploy management\nas a disciplined process will help you\n\n194\n00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:20.297\nstreamline the deployment of your releases\nand govern them effectively, okay.\n\n195\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.720\nNow, Service Validation and Testing.\n\n196\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.350\nI just mentioned that one of the steps\nof releasing deployment management is\n\n197\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.156\nbuilding and testing.\n\n198\n00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:36.010\nAnd Service Validation and Testing as\na separate process is a relatively new\n\n199\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:41.500\naddition to ITL, brought to life\nin 2011 as part of the updates.\n\n200\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.100\nAnd Service Validation and\nTesting is seen as\n\n201\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.600\na specific process unique to\nthe challenges of validation and testing.\n\n202\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.140\nNow notice the word Service Validation and\nTesting.\n\n203\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.270\nWe're not talking necessarily\nonly about solutions or systems.\n\n204\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.990\nCertainly you'll do UAT,\nyou'll do system integration testing, UAT,\n\n205\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.680\nuser acceptance testing.\n\n206\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.530\nSystem integration testing perhaps,\n\n207\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.520\nperhaps you'll do load testing or\nperformance testing.\n\n208\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.010\nYou can test technology\nabsolutely its in the scope\n\n209\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.820\nof Service Validation and Testing.\n\n210\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:20.670\nBut remember service validation, or\nservice, is something bigger than system.\n\n211\n00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.020\nSo whatever your service acceptance\ncriteria turns out to be which is\n\n212\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.990\ndecided and service design.\n\n213\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.610\nService Validation and\nTesting is going to meet,\n\n214\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.420\nmake sure that service accepts\nthis criteria has been met.\n\n215\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.264\nWhich again could include all\nthis test that are passed,\n\n216\n00:11:36.264 --> 00:11:37.933\nthis technology test or passed.\n\n217\n00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:41.880\nBut also can include things like\ntraining has been completed.\n\n218\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.650\nSo how would you validate the training\nhas been completed is it a scouts honor?\n\n219\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.600\nWhich could be, totally appropriate.\n\n220\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.450\nThey said they took the training so\nyou checked the box, right?\n\n221\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.060\nYou asked them, did you have the training?\n\n222\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.970\nYes, box checked.\n\n223\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.210\nThat could be your point of validation.\n\n224\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.280\nOr is it more thorough than that?\n\n225\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.310\nDo you actually give them a test?\n\n226\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.760\nSay okay, you said you took the training.\n\n227\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.540\nHe's a quiz, show me you know\nwhat you're talking about here?\n\n228\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.690\nSo you walk them through the steps for\ninstance.\n\n229\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.830\nIn my own experience we used to validate\nthe training of the service desk for\n\n230\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.630\ninstance by calling him up and\nsaying here is the scenario.\n\n231\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.790\nSimulating a call saying,\nhere's what we have.\n\n232\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.200\nWhat do you do, right?\n\n233\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.000\nAnd can they follow the right\nscript of troubleshooting?\n\n234\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.020\nCan they find the right answer or\nthe right workaround, etc.?\n\n235\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.740\nWe'd actually walk them through the paces.\n\n236\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.520\nSo, yes they had training, but\n\n237\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.010\nthen we would validate that\nthat training was effective.\n\n238\n00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.730\nBy pushing them through\na little exercise if you will.\n\n239\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.260\nSo again, Service Validation and Testing\ngoes beyond system validation and testing.\n\n240\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.380\nAnd it's all within the scope\nof this process called\n\n241\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.860\nService Validation and Testing.\n\n242\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.930\nNow, in the absence of this\nwhat's the value being missed?\n\n243\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.560\nI mean I have a feeling that if\nyou've been in IT long at all.\n\n244\n00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.180\nYou've seen effective testing, and\nyou've seen ineffective testing.\n\n245\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.920\nSo iTool is simply presenting this as\na key discipline so that you don't\n\n246\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.210\nfall into the pit of bad testing, or\nthe manifestations of bad testing.\n\n247\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.960\nIf you deliver something that tested out\nperfectly In the test environment, and\n\n248\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.580\nthen you launched it in the production and\nit falls over the first day,\n\n249\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.030\nand you're troubleshooting\nall kinds of things.\n\n250\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.340\nThen obviously your testing\nwasn't robust enough,\n\n251\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.455\nyou didn't manage the environments\nwell enough, etc..\n\n252\n00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:26.165\nSo whatever the cause of bad testing,\n\n253\n00:13:26.165 --> 00:13:29.975\nor good testing Service Validation and\nTesting, as a process,\n\n254\n00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:34.485\nis gonna be the discipline that you\nneed to make sure that's well governed.\n\n255\n00:13:34.485 --> 00:13:36.625\nAs this shows up on the exam,\n\n256\n00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:41.600\nit's gonna be the kind of situation\nwhere there'll be proof of bad testing.\n\n257\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.790\nOr there'll be proof of ineffective\nenvironmental management or\n\n258\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.110\nthere'll be proof of no testing.\n\n259\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.520\nThat sort of thing.\n\n260\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.410\nAnd in the absence of those, you're gonna\nmanifest those things in certain problems.\n\n261\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.476\nHow would you fix that?\n\n262\n00:13:54.476 --> 00:13:58.917\nMaybe do some analysis on how chronic the\nproblem is and consider the adoption of\n\n263\n00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:03.220\na service and validation and\ntesting receipt as an example.\n\n264\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.720\nAll right.\n\n265\n00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.220\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n266\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.140\n&gt;&gt; Now change evaluation.\n\n267\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.358\nInteresting, interesting, history.\n\n268\n00:14:11.358 --> 00:14:12.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now\n\n269\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.590\nchange management is the process\nthat evaluates changes.\n\n270\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.879\nBut you can formalize change evaluation to\nbe its own separate process, and therefore\n\n271\n00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:29.680\nfeed the change management process with\na good evaluation of the change, right?\n\n272\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:37.900\nJust as release and deployment management\nhas a step called build and test.\n\n273\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.020\nTesting tends to be so\n\n274\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.850\nnuanced that you have a separate process\ncalled Service Validation and Testing.\n\n275\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:48.880\nSo again, change evaluation can\nprecede the approval of a change.\n\n276\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.070\nIt also can come after the implementation\nof a change to make sure\n\n277\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:00.510\nthat the value that was sought Is\nactually the value being delivered.\n\n278\n00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.800\nSo consider the change of\nevaluation s of formal process\n\n279\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.680\nto predict what value should be given.\n\n280\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.045\nAnd therefore, feed the decision\nwhether or not to approve a change.\n\n281\n00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:14.850\nChange evaluation can also be brought\nafter a change is implemented\n\n282\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.560\nto evaluate whether the change\ndelivered the appropriate value.\n\n283\n00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.577\nNow, what's value?\n\n284\n00:15:19.577 --> 00:15:21.860\nWe talked about this before.\n\n285\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.920\nThe only arbitrary value that really\nmakes any difference is the business.\n\n286\n00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.380\nSo if you've promised that a change you're\nmaking is going to improve availability.\n\n287\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.280\nOr it's going to allow them to\nresolve tickets more quickly or\n\n288\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.880\nreduce the volume of incidents\nthat you're receiving.\n\n289\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.280\nIf the change is promising to reduce those\nvolumes or increase the availability,\n\n290\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.290\nwhatever they might be, then you want\nto evaluate it post defacto, right?\n\n291\n00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.560\nAfter you've launched it or\nbrought the change about,\n\n292\n00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.870\nyou might wanna evaluate to see\ndid we achieve that value, right?\n\n293\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.030\nOr you are just kind of guessing.\n\n294\n00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.040\nWe think this might work.\n\n295\n00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.305\nSo you try this and you find out\nthe availability actually went down.\n\n296\n00:16:03.305 --> 00:16:09.234\nA formal change evaluation will give you\nthe data the objective view of whether or\n\n297\n00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:14.070\nnot the value you are seeking\nis actually delivered.\n\n298\n00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.250\nNow, does that mean you\nevaluate every single change?\n\n299\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.450\nNot necessarily.\n\n300\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.630\nI mean formally,\nevaluate every single change,\n\n301\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.140\nyes, you evaluate all changes\nat some level of rigor.\n\n302\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.810\nNot all changes would require a full\nformal change evaluation process.\n\n303\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.920\nThat's what your governance models\nwill take care of, which ones do,\n\n304\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.410\nwhich ones don't.\n\n305\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.440\nBut having a formal regime to\nevaluate the effectives of change\n\n306\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.580\nis an important value you can add through\nthe change evaluation process, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.850\nNow, circling back around to\nsomething we've talked about already,\n\n308\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.650\nknowledge management.\n\n309\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.170\nIt's one of those transition processes\nthat happens to show up in transition.\n\n310\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.810\nBut we've also seen where knowledge\nmanagement is absolutely in play\n\n311\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.290\nat every single stage of the life cycle,\nevery time, all the time.\n\n312\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.550\nKnowledge management is data,\nit's information.\n\n313\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.890\nIt's becoming knowledge of some\nsort of presentation layer\n\n314\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:13.500\nof this information to make it\npossible to discern knowledge.\n\n315\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.610\nAnd then hopefully, enable wise decisions.\n\n316\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.670\nNow, wisdom is not in\nthe domain of just one stage.\n\n317\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.748\nYou need to be wise across\nall the stages of life cycle.\n\n318\n00:17:23.748 --> 00:17:28.329\nSo to call out knowledge management\nis a service transaction process is\n\n319\n00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:29.635\nreally a misnomer.\n\n320\n00:17:29.635 --> 00:17:33.203\nIt happens to be born there in the book\ncalled service transaction but\n\n321\n00:17:33.203 --> 00:17:37.800\nknowledge management is something we do\nwhether we have a formal process or not.\n\n322\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.860\nWe have to share information\namong ourselves.\n\n323\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.000\nFormalizing knowledge management builds\nthe culture of knowledge sharing.\n\n324\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.600\nAnd that's the primary value it delivers,\na holistic approach\n\n325\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.140\nto how information is shared, across\nthe organization and across all stages.\n\n326\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.640\nThat's the value proposition\nof knowledge management.\n\n327\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.450\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.264\nThat's the service transition\nprocess is in a nutshell.\n\n329\n00:18:04.264 --> 00:18:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Wow okay, well we did that.\n\n330\n00:18:06.320

ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.470\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.900\nI'm your host Zach Memos as\nwe continue on Vitel Mac.\n\n8\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.240\nAnd we're looking at service operation\nprocesses right now with Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.260\nGood morning, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.590\nGood to see you again.\n\n12\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Happy to be here, as always.\n\n13\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.020\nAnd as Zach said,\n\n14\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.480\nwe're continuing on with our look at\nthe processes within the MALC course.\n\n15\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.840\nI want to, as we did with the Everest.\n\n16\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.910\nSo I to want to frame the context of this,\nlook at the processes as\n\n17\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.910\nre energizing the value proposition for\nthese processes.\n\n18\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.698\nUnderstanding what these processes do.\n\n19\n00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.588\nOf course, it's important, understanding\nthe value through the business is even\n\n20\n00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.563\nmore important as you consider\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n21\n00:00:55.563 --> 00:00:58.821\nSo that's going to help you operationally,\nback at the office,\n\n22\n00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:01.720\nunderstanding the value\nof these processes bring.\n\n23\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.880\nIf you need to sell the idea to someone,\n\n24\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.250\nlike, why to we need\nthe availability management process?\n\n25\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.790\nOr why do we need a portfolio\nmanagement process?\n\n26\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.150\nThe reason why is because some\nvalue can be delivered from them.\n\n27\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.110\nITIL didn't make this stuff up,\nthey did a lot of research.\n\n28\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570\nAnd as we look at service operations,\n\n29\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.820\nlooking at those five processes\nwithin service operations.\n\n30\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.080\nAgain, look to reenergize\nyour understanding of\n\n31\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.220\nwhy these processes exist,\nnot just what do they do.\n\n32\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.720\nRight?\nSo\n\n33\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.190\nfirst of all,\nlet's have a look at event management.\n\n34\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.790\nYou recall that event management is\n\n35\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.600\nthe process that manages those things\nthat can automatically be detected.\n\n36\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.105\nSo the detection of an event is automated\n\n37\n00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:47.480\nthat can in itself lead to\nthe automation of a response.\n\n38\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.840\nSo if you automatically detect an event,\nyou have a basis for\n\n39\n00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.830\nautomating your response to the event.\n\n40\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.650\nAnd therefore, you could keep\nincidents from even happening.\n\n41\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.664\nRight, so if as an example\nan intrusion detection system for\n\n42\n00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:06.770\nsecurity measures is a very\nelaborate event management system.\n\n43\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.080\nIf it has algorithms working within it so\n\n44\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.170\nthat it can understand the behavior\non the network and perceive or\n\n45\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.370\ndetect, I should say, anomalous\nactivity that could be suspicious.\n\n46\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.590\nAnd it could automate\nthe response to suppress it or\n\n47\n00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.980\nto limit its effects, as an example.\n\n48\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.750\nSo the value of management really\nis borne on the early detection.\n\n49\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.960\nRight.\nAnd therefore,\n\n50\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.240\nthe prevention of significant\nincidents happening.\n\n51\n00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.854\nOkay.\nSo as we decided on service design is\n\n52\n00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:43.601\ninvolved in event management as\na Precursor to what event should you be\n\n53\n00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:44.573\nmonitoring.\n\n54\n00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:47.383\nOr what event should you\nbe trying to detect.\n\n55\n00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:51.835\nSo service design is trying to build\ninto the fabric of your operation\n\n56\n00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:54.610\nan appropriate event management regime.\n\n57\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.520\nService transition can be used to\nvalidate event management, to make\n\n58\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.540\nsure that your event management regime as\nintended is gonna be built accordingly.\n\n59\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.100\nAnd of course,\n\n60\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.610\nin service operations, it's where event\nmanagement actually provides its value.\n\n61\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.010\nAnd it has a very tight integration with\nincident and problem management, right?\n\n62\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.830\nAs we'll discuss as we continue here\non this particular graphic showing\n\n63\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.269\nthe interaction among\nthese different processes.\n\n64\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.510\nNow, I think I'd ask it this way,\ndoes every event lead to an incident?\n\n65\n00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:37.174\nThe reason I ask that is to assess\nthe stage for distinguishing between and\n\n66\n00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:38.559\nevent and an incident.\n\n67\n00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.420\nSo, is it an event when\nI log in in the morning?\n\n68\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.020\nWell, in effect, it's officially\nan event because it's probably logged.\n\n69\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.530\nSo the detection of that particular\nactivity is logged, it's automated.\n\n70\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.580\nSo it is an event,\nit's just an informational event.\n\n71\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.640\nAnd you might remember that\nthere's also warning events.\n\n72\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.420\nWhat if Terry Decker is\ntrying to login 50 times\n\n73\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.436\nsimultaneously from 17\ndifferent geographic locations?\n\n74\n00:04:02.436 --> 00:04:04.458\nRight?\nThat's something [CROSSTALK]-\n\n75\n00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:05.590\n&gt;&gt; It would be a lot of fun, actually.\n\n76\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.385\nRight.\nI would like to see that if you would.\n\n77\n00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:08.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it couldn't be me personally, but\n\n78\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.590\nobviously, something's going on.\n\n79\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.890\nWe could be under attack\nin that situation.\n\n80\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.950\nSo that could be an event that leads\nto no, we got to look at this, right?\n\n81\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.590\nThat sort of thing.\n\n82\n00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.540\nSo an event doesn't necessarily\nlead to an incident, but it can.\n\n83\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.450\nAnd by that,\n\n84\n00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.550\nif disk is 75% full, then maybe you should\ngo take care of the storage base, right.\n\n85\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.130\nSo before it falls over or\ngets completely full,\n\n86\n00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.900\nyou would respond and that response\nwould come through incident management.\n\n87\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.750\nSo or perhaps even through automated\nif you could automate such things.\n\n88\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.780\nSo Event Management serves as a basis for\nautomation.\n\n89\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.930\nIt also allows for\nan integration with Incident management.\n\n90\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.880\nNow, problem management and\nevent management are also gonna be pretty\n\n91\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.680\nsynergetic, in that problem managers can\ndo due diligence for when events happen.\n\n92\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.020\nThey can look at the logs,\nthey can look at the circumstances, and\n\n93\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.920\ndetermine unhealthy situations or\nopportunities for improvement.\n\n94\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.920\nSo problem management doing deep dives\ninto the kind of Information that event\n\n95\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.830\nmanagement can bring is a good point\nof synergy between those two processes.\n\n96\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.480\nSo again, the value of this boils down to\n\n97\n00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.650\nearly detection means\npotentially early prevention.\n\n98\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.990\nSo you don't even get\nthe disk getting full or\n\n99\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.940\nyou don't get servers falling over.\n\n100\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.510\nOr you don't get Terry Decker logged\nin 50 times simultaneously from\n\n101\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.424\n17 geographic locations.\n\n102\n00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:36.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which would again be a lot of fun.\n\n103\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.130\nRight so now onto incident management.\n\n104\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.000\nThe primary purpose of incident\nmanagement also tells about its value.\n\n105\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.550\nThe primary purpose of incident\nmanagement is to restore service\n\n106\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.070\nas quickly as possible.\n\n107\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.300\nAnd therein, lies its value.\n\n108\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.540\nIncident management streamlines\nthe recovery when service is disrupted,\n\n109\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.610\nright, therefore, pleasing clients.\n\n110\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.280\nThey don't have to experience\nas many outages or\n\n111\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.530\nas much disruption to their\nday to day life, right?\n\n112\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.360\nThey're trying to work through a service.\n\n113\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.700\nAnd the service is down.\n\n114\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.270\nThat's painful,\nthey're trying to get work done.\n\n115\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.140\nAnd yet they can't get it done\nbecause the service is down.\n\n116\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.860\nEfficient management can\nquickly restore service.\n\n117\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.720\nThen, obviously, you're streamlining that\noperation for the customer themselves.\n\n118\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.800\nSo the primary value of instant management\nis intrinsic to its primary purpose,\n\n119\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.578\nrestoring service as quickly as possible.\n\n120\n00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:30.480\nOkay?\n\n121\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.385\nAn effective incident management regime is\ngoing to interact with lots of different\n\n122\n00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:35.380\nother processes.\n\n123\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.240\nAn effective incident management team is\ncertainly going to work with the primary\n\n124\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.900\nfunction, the service desk, but\nservice level management is going to be\n\n125\n00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.520\nperhaps monitoring the health of incident\nmanagement through specific measurements.\n\n126\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.210\nIt's very common that service level\nmanagement will have an agreed\n\n127\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.600\nincident resolution time.\n\n128\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.370\nFor instance, we'll resolve 80% of\nour incidents within two days, or\n\n129\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.020\nwithin two hours, or within two minutes.\n\n130\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.400\nWhatever that target might be\nservice-level management is gonna kinda\n\n131\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.420\nsetting the stage for those targeted\nperformance levels, all right?\n\n132\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.450\nInformation security management and\nincident management.\n\n133\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.530\nAnd, of course, anything become\nan incident, infrastructure management,\n\n134\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.400\nsecurity management, capacity management,\navailability management.\n\n135\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.470\nAll those processes have born into them,\n\n136\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.030\nhopefully, some sort of monitoring so\nyou'll know if they're being effective.\n\n137\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.840\nAnd through that monitoring,\nan incident may arise, right?\n\n138\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.500\nThat monitoring may come formally through\nevent management or it may come through\n\n139\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.770\na little bit less formally through\ndashboards and whatnot so that you're\n\n140\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.450\nlooking at the health of the environment\non an ongoing basis, all right.\n\n141\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.020\nOf course, incident management could\nbe affected with access management.\n\n142\n00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.600\nInappropriate use of access\ncould trigger an event,\n\n143\n00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.900\nthat event could trigger and incident.\n\n144\n00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.700\nProblem management and incident\nmanagement, a very closely related.\n\n145\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.110\nIn fact, problem management's job is\nto reduce the number of incidents and\n\n146\n00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.440\nto reduce the likelihood\nof them recurring.\n\n147\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.460\nSo problem management is kind of\na watch dog over in instant management.\n\n148\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.500\nDoing the due diligence for\nall the incidents that might arise.\n\n149\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.880\nProblem management is there to deep dive,\nroot out problems and\n\n150\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.190\ncarry on which is a great\nsegue to problem management.\n\n151\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.550\nEffectively what problem management is\ntrying to get done is higher service\n\n152\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.990\navailability.\n\n153\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.500\nIn my own experience on the earliest\nprocesses, we adopted was incident and\n\n154\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.620\nproblem management.\n\n155\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.400\nAnd shortly after that was availability\nmanagement because problem management and\n\n156\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.460\navailability management were so\nclosely linked together.\n\n157\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.440\nLet me put that a different way.\n\n158\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.200\nCustomers tend to really notice down time,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they do.\n\n160\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, now if there's a little glitch\nin the application where a button is kinda\n\n161\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.680\nskewy or there's not quite\nthe functionality they want,\n\n162\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.380\nthat'll concern them for sure.\n\n163\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.370\nBut when the service is completely down,\nthat gets a lot of notice.\n\n164\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.370\nSo customers are highly dissatisfied\nwhen there is downtime.\n\n165\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.820\nSo, availability, therefore,\nis an important aspect.\n\n166\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.860\nProblem management gets into high\ngear when there are outages.\n\n167\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.790\nThey do, that's a major incident\nwhen there's an outage,\n\n168\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.630\nand problem management's involved,\nand a major incident reviews, so\n\n169\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:25.130\nthat you can find the root cause of\nthat outage and eliminate it or at least\n\n170\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.240\ntry to prevent it from coming back if you\ncan't quite eliminate it, reduce the pain.\n\n171\n00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.957\nProblem management can also be\nhelpful in troubleshooting scripts so\n\n172\n00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:34.537\nwe can more quickly recover.\n\n173\n00:09:34.537 --> 00:09:39.346\nSo maybe it's a pipe drink to think we'll\nnever, we'll get rid of all outages but\n\n174\n00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:43.737\ncan you get better at restoring service,\nnot just preventing the outage,\n\n175\n00:09:43.737 --> 00:09:45.390\nwhich you hope to do.\n\n176\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.720\nBut if you can't prevent them,\ncan you bring it back more quickly.\n\n177\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.700\nProblem management is there for that due\ndiligence and that deliberative look.\n\n178\n00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.910\nProblem management also does trend\nanalysis of incidents to discern\n\n179\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.120\ndo we see the same thing all the time.\n\n180\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.890\nRight.\nWe're not\n\n181\n00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.200\nnecessarily talking about availability,\nbut how many users called last week saying\n\n182\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.100\nthey couldn't find the submit button,\nright?\n\n183\n00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.600\nMy goodness!\n\n184\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.860\nWe had 150 calls last year,\nmaybe last week.\n\n185\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.850\nMaybe we should redesign the application\nso the submit button is a little bit more\n\n186\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.590\nobvious because people keep\nasking about that thing.\n\n187\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.858\nSo if you do trim analysis and\nfind some high\n\n188\n00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:30.570\ndegree of attention to a particular area,\nProblem Management can recognize it and\n\n189\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.980\nhopefully, put in some countermeasures to\nforestall those incidents coming back in.\n\n190\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:41.470\nSo the value of Problem Management is\nto make availability problems go away,\n\n191\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:48.310\nto reduce the ongoing impact\nof service disruptions and\n\n192\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.610\nto minimize the recurrence\nof service disruptions.\n\n193\n00:10:54.744 --> 00:10:56.892\nRequest fulfillment.\n\n194\n00:10:56.892 --> 00:11:02.560\nRequest fulfillment is\nthe process that takes care\n\n195\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.390\nof the standard activities\nto deliver service such as\n\n196\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:14.990\nsomeone needs a new password that\ncould be a request fulfillment engine.\n\n197\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.050\nSomeone needs a headset.\n\n198\n00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.690\nSomeone needs to replace the battery\nin a laptop, a new mouse, right?\n\n199\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.990\nOr they need to request a virtual\nserver be built for them.\n\n200\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.540\nSomething that may be standardized.\n\n201\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.660\nSo these standard activities could\nbe turned into a request fulfillment\n\n202\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.130\nopportunity, where you put\nsome sort of process flow\n\n203\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:39.390\nin place to streamline the fulfillment\nof those standard activities.\n\n204\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.300\nSo the nature of it being fairly\nrepeatable is intrinsic to request\n\n205\n00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.990\nfulfillment and to do these things\nvery quickly and in a repeatable,\n\n206\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.100\nin predictable way, if you could\ndo it repeatedly and predictably,\n\n207\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.630\nyou can lower cost for providing\nstandardized services, all right?\n\n208\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.330\nIf the service that you're providing\nrequire users have handsets,\n\n209\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.980\ndo they have to travel to a location and\npick up headset?\n\n210\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.690\nCan it be delivered to\nthem at their desktop?\n\n211\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.200\nHow easy is it for\nthem to request it, right.\n\n212\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.940\nSo, if it's a common thing that happens,\n\n213\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.090\neveryone requests a headset every time,\nthen standardize that request.\n\n214\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.630\nWhat about request for a new laptop?\n\n215\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.020\nAll right, they have an existing laptop.\n\n216\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.000\nThey need a new laptop but\n\n217\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.960\nyou gotta get the data off of it and\ndo all sorts of things.\n\n218\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.500\nIs there a way you could\nstreamline that process?\n\n219\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.540\nSo that when a user is getting his\nlaptop replacement, it's streamlined for\n\n220\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.650\nthat user and for the provider of\nthat service making repeatable.\n\n221\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.174\nSo the value of request\nfulfillment is to streamline and\n\n222\n00:12:41.174 --> 00:12:44.815\nlower costs of fulfilling\nthose standardized services.\n\n223\n00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:51.390\nAccess management and\nthe value to business.\n\n224\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.270\nGiving the right people access and\n\n225\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.760\npreventing the wrong people from gaining\naccess is what access management is about.\n\n226\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.200\nAccess management is\nthe operational extension\n\n227\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.659\nof your security management process and\nyour security policies.\n\n228\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.940\nSo, streamlining access management so that\nthe right people get access to the things\n\n229\n00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.560\nthey need, and the wrong people don't,\nis the value access management brings.\n\n230\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.250\nSo, as example, my first day of\nemployment, I call the Service Desk and\n\n231\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.260\nsay, I'd like access to the HR database,\nI'd like to review everyone's salaries.\n\n232\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.070\nAccess management's there\nas a governance factor.\n\n233\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.020\nSo, sir, I appreciate that,\nthat's not how we do access management.\n\n234\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.430\nThere's a process for\nrequesting this and it's not by you, but\n\n235\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.170\nit's the HR director that must\nmake that request on your behalf.\n\n236\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.011\nAnd then, once that request\ncomes from the HR Director,\n\n237\n00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:48.913\nwe will give you appropriate access.\n\n238\n00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:51.900\nSo contact the HR Director if\nyou have any other questions.\n\n239\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.910\nAnd perhaps I am\nthe compensation analysts,\n\n240\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.840\nI'm suppose to have access to it.\n\n241\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.110\nThen the process,\nI'll go back to may boss and say hey.\n\n242\n00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.950\nHR director could you\nplease make this request?\n\n243\n00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.100\nI need access to the database.\n\n244\n00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.160\nHaven't got it yet.\n\n245\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.630\nAnd hopefully, there is a request\nfulfillment process in front of this\n\n246\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.070\naccess management process\nto make that easier.\n\n247\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.380\nBut nonetheless, access management\nis handling it in the back end.\n\n248\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.919\nSo keep in mind that access management\nis not in the business of authorizing.\n\n249\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.310\nAccess.\n\n250\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.110\nRight?\nThe HR\n\n251\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.080\ndirector is the one who\nauthorized it in this case.\n\n252\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.350\nAccess management is managing that\nrequest and making sure that a particular\n\n253\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.940\nprocess is followed so the right people\nhave access and the wrong people don't.\n\n254\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.950\nSo again,\naccess management is the operational\n\n255\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.330\nextension of security management.\n\n256\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.085\nSo you'll see it certainly\nin the upper left here.\n\n257\n00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:41.690\nService-level management,\n\n258\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:47.080\nyou could put Service Level targets\nagainst this process of access management.\n\n259\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.115\nIf shouldn't take six\ndays to get your access.\n\n260\n00:14:49.115 --> 00:14:51.510\nCould they do that a bit more quickly?\n\n261\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.180\nSo you could put targets\nto motivate the performance\n\n262\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.490\nof the access management process,\nso that's also streamlined.\n\n263\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.300\nAs I mentioned before, you might put\na request fulfillment methodology in\n\n264\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.455\nfront of such access management\nrequests as well, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:07.455 --> 00:15:09.360\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.860\nThat's the five processes\nof service operations, and\n\n267\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.780\nthe value propositions\nthat each of them hold.\n\n268\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.500\nAgain, not any new learning here in MALC,\na lot of refocusing and\n\n269\n00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.410\nreenergizing What learning\nyou've already had.\n\n270\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.540\nSo as you're taking on the challenge\nof analysing the processes and\n\n271\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.360\nhopefully you've printed the little\nhandout that has all the processes listed\n\n272\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.390\nby the stage they're in.\n\n273\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.920\nAs you look at those processes And\nyour asking yourself why do these things.\n\n274\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.980\nYou should have a ready answer.\n\n275\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.330\nWhy do availability management?\n\n276\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.220\nWhy have a process called\nservice portfolio management?\n\n277\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.720\nAnd the way you answer that question is.\n\n278\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.280\nWhat is the value to the business?\n\n279\n00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:48.840\nAll right.\n\n280\n00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.010\nIs it saving money?\n\n281\n00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.430\nIs it reducing risk?\n\n282\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.670\nIs it reducing or increasing quality?\n\n283\n00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.190\nWhat is it actually doing?\n\n284\n00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:55.920\nRight.\n\n285\n00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.990\nOn the MALC exam, for\nthese taking the exam.\n\n286\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.780\nIt is a very common approach for\nthe test maker.\n\n287\n00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:07.960\nTo put you in a position of proving or\nrecommending a process being implemented.\n\n288\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.480\nAnd the way you recommend it is through\nthe business value that it brings.\n\n289\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.410\nSo you're going to talk about\nthe purpose and activities involved.\n\n290\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.070\nBut ultimately,\nyou're going to have to highlight why.\n\n291\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.890\nThis process exists,\nnot just what does it do, all right?\n\n292\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.740\nThat's that, Zack.\n\n293\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.690\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job, Jerry.\n\n294\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.470\nService operation processes.\n\n295\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.860\nThis is ITIL MALC.\n\n296\n00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.900\nSo many episodes in this series.\n\n297\n00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.470\nWatch them all.\n\n298\n00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.210\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n299\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.040\nAnd thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n300\n00:16:33.040 -->

00:00:12.055\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:14.968\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you again for\njoining us on ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:17.380\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.680\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\nITIL MALC as we continue with this series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.295\nRight now,\nwe're looking at universal value of CSI.\n\n8\n00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:29.430\nAnd bringing us all the information\nwe need is Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.555\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Zach,\nhappy to be here as always.\n\n10\n00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:32.890\n&gt;&gt; Glad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.360\n&gt;&gt; And as Zach said, we're gonna be\ntalking about the universal value of CSI,\n\n12\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.900\nwhich is kinda interesting.\n\n13\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.108\nWe talked about in these previous\nepisodes, the service strategy processes,\n\n14\n00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.812\nthe service design processes.\n\n15\n00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:45.790\nAnd it was always plural, processes.\n\n16\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.800\nAnd when we get to CSI,\nthere's only one process,\n\n17\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.670\nthe seven step improvement process.\n\n18\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.349\nThe simplicity of discussing CSI\nbelies its importance, it really does.\n\n19\n00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:02.516\nCuz it is a fairly simple approach,\nit's fairly simple to teach.\n\n20\n00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:05.632\nIt's even fairly intuitive\nto actually implement.\n\n21\n00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.039\nThe challenge is finding\nthe right improvements and\n\n22\n00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.005\nworking on the right ones at the right\ntime and seeing them through, right?\n\n23\n00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.066\nThat's where the challenge really comes,\nbut conceptually and\n\n24\n00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.828\nacademically, it's fairly straightforward.\n\n25\n00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:22.043\nNow, if you'll look here at the slide,\n\n26\n00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:25.575\none of the value statements of\nseven step improvement process.\n\n27\n00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:29.971\nThat you ensure current and\nfuture business requirements can be met,\n\n28\n00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.630\nthat's fairly generic.\n\n29\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.415\nYou're able to improve services\nwithout spending more money,\n\n30\n00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:36.077\nthat's another way to look at it too.\n\n31\n00:01:36.077 --> 00:01:42.302\nTo continually improve services\nwithout spending more money, right?\n\n32\n00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:46.480\nSo that's the trick and\nthat's the real value that CSI brings.\n\n33\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.764\nNow, as we look here, CSI is certainly,\nit's a stage, it has its own book.\n\n34\n00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:56.855\nAnd ITIL has described the five\nstages of the life cycle.\n\n35\n00:01:56.855 --> 00:02:01.138\nService strategy, design,\ntransition, operation, and CSI.\n\n36\n00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:04.538\nIt gets its own book,\nit's even called a stage, but\n\n37\n00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:07.880\na stage seems to follow\nsome chronological order.\n\n38\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.930\nCertainly, you come up with a strategy\nbefore you design something.\n\n39\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.840\nAnd you design something\nbefore you transition it, and\n\n40\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.899\nyou transition it and\nit becomes live in operation.\n\n41\n00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.695\nSo I like the fact that it's own book,\nit's certainly appropriate.\n\n42\n00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:24.520\nThe fact that it's called a stage is\nsomewhat of a misnomer because it's\n\n43\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520\nalways open.\n\n44\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.803\nIt's always open for business,\nit should just be the way you work, right?\n\n45\n00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:34.970\nSo CSI is not necessarily a stage\nbecause it's always there.\n\n46\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.289\nAnd, as we've described\non the screen here,\n\n47\n00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.912\nthe CSI is certainly involved\nin service strategy.\n\n48\n00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:44.340\nAnd service design and\nservice transition and service operations.\n\n49\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.023\nIt's there for all of them,\ntrying to improve all of them, right?\n\n50\n00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:52.295\nIt could be for instance,\na CSI initiative,\n\n51\n00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:57.130\nlike an improvement initiative\ncould be a strategic initiative.\n\n52\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.080\nIf you hope to improve the quality\nof a service that requires\n\n53\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.150\na major upgrade to the platform and\nthe softwares being used by the client.\n\n54\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.960\nYou're getting away from mainframe and\nW terminals perhaps to an intuitive\n\n55\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.670\nweb interface,\na major change to the front end.\n\n56\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.820\nAs well as a major change to the back end,\n\n57\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.510\nthat could be your strategic\ndirection you're making, right?\n\n58\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.280\nWell, this could have\nbeen born out of CSI,\n\n59\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.700\nyou could have done lots of customer\nsurveys and seen the results.\n\n60\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.850\nAnd gotten a lot of customer feedback\nthat says, this is not working very well,\n\n61\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.990\nit's too hard to use, not very intuitive.\n\n62\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.081\nCould we have a web interface instead?\n\n63\n00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:40.430\nRight, so CSI could feed strategy,\ncertainly could.\n\n64\n00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.954\nCertainly CSI could be there to help\nwith design in transition operations.\n\n65\n00:03:44.954 --> 00:03:50.435\nHave you ever operated or had to\noperate a service or an application or\n\n66\n00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:54.511\na system, if you will,\nthat wasn't fully baked?\n\n67\n00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:59.210\nYou got it and\nit was clunky, it fell over.\n\n68\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.557\nAnd you discovered needs for\nimprovement, and the needs for\n\n69\n00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:07.090\nimprovement actually could have been\nforestalled up in service design, right?\n\n70\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.885\nService design as its value proposition is\nto make sure there's no remediation work,\n\n71\n00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.535\nas little remediation work as possible.\n\n72\n00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:18.610\nWell, if you're always remediating\nthings here in service operation then\n\n73\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.750\nmaybe what you gotta go\nimprove is service design.\n\n74\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.520\nSo CSI can certainly motivate improvements\nto the service design process and\n\n75\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.032\nof course, with transition.\n\n76\n00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:31.379\nI mean, I can cite all kinds of examples\nhere but a common one, at least I\n\n77\n00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.720\nexperienced was where we bring something\nnew into the operational environment.\n\n78\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.465\nAnd it breaks and someone says,\nwell, did you test it?\n\n79\n00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:40.889\nAnd I said yep, we tested it.\n\n80\n00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.802\nAnd you go back and\nlook in the environments and\n\n81\n00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:48.358\nyou realize you tested it on a test\nenvironment that wasn't a reasonable\n\n82\n00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:51.362\nenough replica of\nthe operation environment.\n\n83\n00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:55.035\nSo the test was not really that valid,\nit worked in the test environment,\n\n84\n00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.150\nwhy doesn't it work in operations?\n\n85\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.090\nWell, because operations or a production\nenvironment has all these other\n\n86\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.980\nconfigurations that conflict\nwith that particular code.\n\n87\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.538\nAgain, we have a successful\npass in transition but\n\n88\n00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:13.499\nit failed when we actually\nbrought it into operations.\n\n89\n00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.999\nCSI can look at that kind of data and\nsay, well, what's up with our testing and\n\n90\n00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.340\nvalidation regime?\n\n91\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.294\nLet's improve it, right?\n\n92\n00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:21.024\nAnd of course, day to day operations.\n\n93\n00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:25.948\nIf your service desk is resolving\nincidents at a pretty strong clip but\n\n94\n00:05:25.948 --> 00:05:30.390\nnot meeting the targets in\nthe service level agreement.\n\n95\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.010\nFor instance, they're supposed to resolve\n80% of the tickets within two hours and\n\n96\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.300\nthey're only resolving about 60%\nof the tickets within two hours.\n\n97\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.972\nThat's operational data you're getting,\nright?\n\n98\n00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:44.580\nWhat could you do to help improve that,\nright?\n\n99\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.430\nReduce the incidents perhaps,\n\n100\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.400\nget better at troubleshooting,\nhave a better known error database.\n\n101\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.390\nWherever the cookie crumbs may lie,\nfollow them through\n\n102\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.630\na methodical CSI process and you can\nimprove day to day operations as well.\n\n103\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.480\nSo again, to reinforce this idea, I like\nthe fact that CSI gets its own book, and\n\n104\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.850\nif you wanna call it a stage.\n\n105\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.030\nThat's all right too, but actually, it\nshould be embedded into everything we do.\n\n106\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.580\nIt just becomes the way we work,\nall right?\n\n107\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.800\nNow here's some examples as it plays out\nas it relates to some specific processes.\n\n108\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.354\nNow you'll recall that the seven step\nprocess has, and here's four of them,\n\n109\n00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:25.942\ngather and process, analyze,\npresent and use the data, and\n\n110\n00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:27.894\nimplementing the improvement.\n\n111\n00:06:27.894 --> 00:06:32.524\nSo there's four of them,\nwhat we're missing are the three steps\n\n112\n00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:37.080\nrelated to the actual defining\nwhat we are going to measure.\n\n113\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.313\nWhat data we're gonna get, I should say,\ndefining the data we're gonna get.\n\n114\n00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:44.613\nAnd how does that relate to the business,\nso the overall vision or\n\n115\n00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.360\nthe strategy of the improvement?\n\n116\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.050\nSo gathering and processing are actually\na couple of different steps there,\n\n117\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.160\nservice level management involved\nin the gathering and processing.\n\n118\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.610\nService level management\nhas one of its jobs,\n\n119\n00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.880\nis to make sure you're gathering data.\n\n120\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.910\nThe example I just mentioned\nthat there's a target for\n\n121\n00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.830\n80% of the tickets to be\nresolved within two hours.\n\n122\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.930\nYou're only resolving 60% that's\ncoming from service level management,\n\n123\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.610\nyou have the target that came\nfrom service level management.\n\n124\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.520\nYou also have the ongoing monitoring,\nthat came from service level management.\n\n125\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.470\nAnd you have the reporting, we're only\ngetting 60%, so you get the idea there.\n\n126\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.220\nNow, not to belabor this point too much,\nbut\n\n127\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.680\neach process has the effectiveness\nof being measured.\n\n128\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.532\nThat's one of the ITIL principles is that\neach process has a characteristic of being\n\n129\n00:07:37.532 --> 00:07:38.360\nmeasurable.\n\n130\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.370\nThe implication is, there,\nis that you're measuring it.\n\n131\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.480\nIf you are measuring a process,\nwhatever the process might be,\n\n132\n00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.181\nyou get data that can point\nto improvement opportunities.\n\n133\n00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:54.023\nSo again, availability management,\nif you've promised 99% availability and\n\n134\n00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:57.980\nyou're only delivering 98%, ding, ding,\nding, you have an opportunity for\n\n135\n00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.148\nimprovement, right?\n\n136\n00:07:59.148 --> 00:08:00.320\nSo really,\n\n137\n00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.190\nI'm just repeating the same thing as I go\nthrough all of these different processes.\n\n138\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.356\nHow can these processes be measured?\n\n139\n00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:07.718\nIf they are measured,\n\n140\n00:08:07.718 --> 00:08:12.020\nyou have a dataset on which you\ncan brace improvement ideas on.\n\n141\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.030\nThat's really what this points to, so\nagain, we could look at any one of these.\n\n142\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.020\nI used incident management\nas one of the ideas.\n\n143\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.690\nFinancial management,\nthings cost a lot, let's reduce cost.\n\n144\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.690\nThat's a measurement, right?\n\n145\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.482\nHow much does it cost to\nresolve a four-hour outage?\n\n146\n00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:31.590\nIs there a cost associated with\nthat that we can point to?\n\n147\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.355\nSo we have an availability\nmanagement figure,\n\n148\n00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:38.610\n99% is our target,\nwe're only getting 98% there, right?\n\n149\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.900\nBut what's that actually cost?\n\n150\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.818\nWell, then now you have a linkup\nto financial management.\n\n151\n00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:45.906\nCould you come up with a cost basis for\noutages and\n\n152\n00:08:45.906 --> 00:08:48.930\ntherefore improve on\nthe money side of things?\n\n153\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.290\nSo really, all this points to is\nan ability to measure your processes and\n\n154\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.940\nbased on those measurements,\ncome up with ideas for improvement.\n\n155\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.120\n&gt;&gt; Checks and balances.\n\n156\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.480\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, now as you see as we depart\na little bit, down near the bottom here,\n\n157\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.370\nwe've got Problem management is there for\nthe analysis in presenting and using.\n\n158\n00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.820\nI like this a lot, problem management\nis a very deliberative process.\n\n159\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.020\nBy deliberation it means,\nit finds the root cause,\n\n160\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.900\nit does the really deep dive\ninto the analysis of things.\n\n161\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.469\nAnd provides a way forward for\ngetting rid of it,\n\n162\n00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:24.611\nthat's what problem management does.\n\n163\n00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:28.358\nSo here it is in the seven step\nimprovement process heavily involved in\n\n164\n00:09:28.358 --> 00:09:31.978\nanalysis and making recommendations\nthrough the presentation and\n\n165\n00:09:31.978 --> 00:09:33.767\nusing of that analysis, right?\n\n166\n00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:34.708\nSo it makes sense there.\n\n167\n00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.215\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, okay.\n\n168\n00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:39.190\n&gt;&gt; And of course, change management,\nlooking at the bottom here.\n\n169\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.430\nChange management is also in play and\n\n170\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.880\nthat's where you actually\nmake your improvement.\n\n171\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.726\nSo if you have an idea to change\nsomething, to improve availability\n\n172\n00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:52.524\nfrom 98% to 99% or to improve incident\nresolution time from 60% to 80%.\n\n173\n00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:56.263\nYou're gonna come up with an idea,\nmaybe you're changing a process,\n\n174\n00:09:56.263 --> 00:10:00.930\nmaybe you're changing a tool set,\nmaybe you're doing some extra training.\n\n175\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.040\nThose changes, that activity\nare governed by change management.\n\n176\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.160\nSo change management is the one that\ncan actually get the improvement idea\n\n177\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.505\non the ground and\nready to go through service transition.\n\n178\n00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:17.515\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I see what you mean by CSI\nthroughout the entire lifecycle,\n\n179\n00:10:17.515 --> 00:10:18.820\nit just makes sense.\n\n180\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.353\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and as you look at this list\nof processes, some come from strategy,\n\n181\n00:10:23.353 --> 00:10:28.172\nsome come from design, some comes from\ntransition and some come from operations.\n\n182\n00:10:28.172 --> 00:10:32.800\nAnd again, this is just a sample of\nthings, you could pick any process.\n\n183\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.054\nNo matter what the process is,\nall 26 of them, including the CSI process,\n\n184\n00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:38.895\nyou could actually improve CSI.\n\n185\n00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:41.530\nSo CSI can be involved in\nimproving itself as well.\n\n186\n00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Always be bettering yourself.\n\n187\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.945\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n188\n00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So then playing out through what we\n\n189\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.840\ndescribed, I described a lot of this text,\nI'm not gonna read these bullets to you.\n\n190\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.738\nI described the fundamental\nconcepts as we go through here.\n\n191\n00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.860\nI talked about its interaction\nwith service level management.\n\n192\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.340\nI talked about its interaction with\navailability and capacity management,\n\n193\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.720\nright, looking at event management,\nincident management, service desk.\n\n194\n00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.251\nLet's take a look at this\njust a little more deeply.\n\n195\n00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:10.472\nEvent management,\ndidn't call that one out specifically.\n\n196\n00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:12.680\nHow could you measure event management?\n\n197\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.477\nRemember, event management is\nthere to detect events, right,\n\n198\n00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:21.764\nand potentially that event\nleads to an incident, right?\n\n199\n00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:26.187\nMaybe it leads to an incident\nthat is preventative.\n\n200\n00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:31.464\nLike I said, if you can automatically\ndetect that the disk is 75% full and\n\n201\n00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:36.087\nperhaps automate the response to\nsend a ticket to the server team.\n\n202\n00:11:36.087 --> 00:11:39.803\nAnd the server team goes and\nadds more storage or deletes some files or\n\n203\n00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:43.021\nwhatever they need to do to\nincrease the storage capacity.\n\n204\n00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:47.780\nThen you have forestalled\na potential failure, right?\n\n205\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.630\nSo event management can\nlead to early detection,\n\n206\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.330\nincident management can lead to quick\nrestoration or even quick prevention.\n\n207\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.898\nSo if you look at it\nfrom a CSI perspective,\n\n208\n00:11:59.898 --> 00:12:03.139\nif you're analyzing event management.\n\n209\n00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.396\nAnd again, through problem management\nas well, during the deep dive,\n\n210\n00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:06.693\nthat's where that analysis would come.\n\n211\n00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:11.419\nYou perhaps could connect the dots\nbetween the number of storage\n\n212\n00:12:11.419 --> 00:12:15.897\nincidents we had that were not\ndetected by that management.\n\n213\n00:12:15.897 --> 00:12:18.848\nSo maybe you're not\nmonitoring all the disks or\n\n214\n00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:23.298\nmaybe there is a slow down between\nthe detection and the actual action.\n\n215\n00:12:23.298 --> 00:12:28.545\nSo maybe you need to automate the steps in\nbetween the event and incident management.\n\n216\n00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:32.647\nSo you see how CSI could just be paying\nattention to the data coming from these\n\n217\n00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:34.330\ndifferent processes.\n\n218\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.832\nAnd therefore streamline and\n\n219\n00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:38.905\nimprove the service as it's\nbeing delivered to customers.\n\n220\n00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:43.752\nSo they don't experience the outages or\nthe disruption to begin with, right?\n\n221\n00:12:43.752 --> 00:12:51.048\nSecurity management, we talked about\nthese earlier, financial management.\n\n222\n00:12:51.048 --> 00:12:54.925\nAll of them can be in play because they\nget measurement, and if you measure,\n\n223\n00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:57.070\nyou have ability to improve.\n\n224\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.560\nThey also can be involved in\nthe seven step process and\n\n225\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.640\ngiving you the clues as to\nwhat you should be working on.\n\n226\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.628\nPerhaps what you're trying to\nimprove is cost containment, right?\n\n227\n00:13:07.628 --> 00:13:11.138\nSpiraling cost, we keep spending more and\nmore and more on support,\n\n228\n00:13:11.138 --> 00:13:12.237\nwhy is that, right?\n\n229\n00:13:12.237 --> 00:13:15.820\nFinancial management could be giving\nyou that financial data, right?\n\n230\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.607\nAnd maybe you determine that that\nfinancial, that all that's grind,\n\n231\n00:13:20.607 --> 00:13:24.691\nall that spin is related to\nmaintenance tasks on databases.\n\n232\n00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:26.590\nSo now you got two different\nthings going here.\n\n233\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.150\nYou got the financial management\ngiving you the measurement of\n\n234\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.770\nthe data of money being spent.\n\n235\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.410\nAnd you got problem management coming\nin and doing a root cause to find out,\n\n236\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.290\nwhere are we spending this stuff?\n\n237\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.220\nAnd then you have a key candidate,\n\n238\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.050\nwe're spending too much money\non database maintenance.\n\n239\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.280\nWhat should we do to improve that?\n\n240\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.743\nRight, we get the idea how\nthese can interact, okay.\n\n241\n00:13:51.743 --> 00:13:54.505\nAs you get toward analyzing data,\nthe same we talked about before,\n\n242\n00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:57.450\nthis is the deep dive,\nespecially with problem management.\n\n243\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.290\nLooking at the data, what does it tell you\nabout where your improvements might lie,\n\n244\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.960\nas we talked about on that graphic before.\n\n245\n00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.830\nIncident management can\ngive you data to analyze,\n\n246\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.870\nproblem management is doing the analysis.\n\n247\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.688\nAnd of course, information security\ncan assist CSI in documenting and\n\n248\n00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:15.537\nreview your security incidents.\n\n249\n00:14:15.537 --> 00:14:18.350\nAnd say, how many did you have, and what\nwas the impact of that security incident?\n\n250\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.565\nWe had a virus attack last week,\nno data was corrupted.\n\n251\n00:14:21.565 --> 00:14:25.288\nOr we had a virus attack last week,\nwe didn't notice it for three days,\n\n252\n00:14:25.288 --> 00:14:27.430\nwe lost 3 terabytes of data.\n\n253\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.120\nYou see the difference, information\nsecurity is to be monitoring and\n\n254\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.860\ndetecting those types of things.\n\n255\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.080\nBut what is the measurement\nthat could be acted on?\n\n256\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.293\nSo also helping out with\nthat additional thing.\n\n257\n00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:43.620\nSo we had a security incident,\nit lasted three minutes, no damage done.\n\n258\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.250\nVersus we had a security incident, it\nlasted three days, we lost lots of data.\n\n259\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.210\nCSI can be there to get that information\nfrom information security and\n\n260\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.950\nmake appropriate recommendations for\nimprovement.\n\n261\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.870\nSo intrinsic to this understanding of CSI\n\n262\n00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.130\nis the understanding of what the processes\nare actually bringing, right?\n\n263\n00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.503\nWhat do they do,\nwhat is their scope of value?\n\n264\n00:15:06.503 --> 00:15:10.754\nAnd if that value is not being fully\nrealized, then their CSI is to\n\n265\n00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:15.253\nincrease that value, right, and\nreduce cost along the way, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:15.253 --> 00:15:19.708\nAnd then ultimately what you need to\ndo in CSI is use this good data and\n\n267\n00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:23.240\nmake an appropriate response,\nwhat are we gonna do?\n\n268\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.072\nWe have all this information,\n\n269\n00:15:25.072 --> 00:15:29.945\nwe realize that we had seven security\nincidents with no data loss, that's good.\n\n270\n00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:36.030\nWe had five security incidents last month\nwith multiple terabytes of data lost.\n\n271\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.160\nDo the compare and contrast,\nmake a recommendation.\n\n272\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.260\nAnd the presenting and\n\n273\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.640\nusing the information really\njust means making your plan.\n\n274\n00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.610\nHere's what we think is happening,\nhere's what we think we can do to fix it.\n\n275\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.229\nMake a presentation, basically make\na case for what action you need to take.\n\n276\n00:15:52.229 --> 00:15:55.720\nNow, CSI could be for big things.\n\n277\n00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.684\nIt could be for let's say,\nwe're gonna adopt iTool.\n\n278\n00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:00.708\nWe're gonna adopt iTool\nacross the organization,\n\n279\n00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:02.710\nwe're gonna do this over\nthe next three years.\n\n280\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.950\nIt could be something big like that, it\ncould be something at the minutiae level,\n\n281\n00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.190\nvery down deep.\n\n282\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.259\nCSI could be brought in to say,\nlet's improve our known error database so\n\n283\n00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:14.896\nthat we can improve\nincident resolution time.\n\n284\n00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:17.718\nRight, so it could be down in the weeds,\n\n285\n00:16:17.718 --> 00:16:22.290\nit could be way up high,\nCSI operates at both levels all the time.\n\n286\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.020\nSo the challenge on the exam and\n\n287\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.430\none way to take this on an exam,\nthere is a methodical approach,\n\n288\n00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.450\nwhether it's a minutiae type thing or\na big picture thing.\n\n289\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.290\nYou look before you leap, you analyze\nbefore you come up with a plan, and\n\n290\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.500\nyou plan before you act.\n\n291\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.567\nOn any given test question, you might find\nan answer that's not gonna be the five\n\n292\n00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:46.549\nanswer that will jump to a conclusion.\n\n293\n00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:51.489\nGo buy that server, go buy that database,\nimplement ITSM right away instead of\n\n294\n00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:56.003\nstepping back and getting stakeholder\nfeedback, analyze the vision.\n\n295\n00:16:56.003 --> 00:16:58.430\nWhere are we trying to go?\n\n296\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:03.380\nMap that vision to a baseline of\nwhere you are right now, measurement.\n\n297\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.985\nAnd then move forward with a plan to move\nthat needle of measurement into the right\n\n298\n00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:07.578\ndirection.\n\n299\n00:17:07.578 --> 00:17:10.000\n&gt;&gt; So taking that 5,000 foot view first.\n\n300\n00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and consistently.\n\n301\n00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.763\nSo a lot of times,\nyour success on a question will be because\n\n302\n00:17:16.763 --> 00:17:20.400\nyou recognize a look\nbefore you leap approach\n\n303\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.396\nas a better approach than just\njumping to a solution, right?\n\n304\n00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:30.265\nThat's ITIL basically reinforcing\nthe idea that the principles of CSI,\n\n305\n00:17:30.265 --> 00:17:35.465\nof looking before you leap, are embedded\nin every decision you make, right?\n\n306\n00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:39.316\nHave data-based decisions,\nmeasurement-based decisions,\n\n307\n00:17:39.316 --> 00:17:41.070\nlook at those measurements.\n\n308\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.267\nKnow where you are now and\n\n309\n00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:45.409\nwhy you care about moving the needle\ninto a different direction.\n\n310\n00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:50.387\nOnce you have that understand, then you\ncan go into the idea of planning in for\n\n311\n00:17:50.387 --> 00:17:52.190\nthat improvement.\n\n312\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:59.165\nOkay, all right, that's it for CSI, and\nthe value of it throughout the life cycle.\n\n313\n00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:00.926\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, and you did it quickly too.\n\n314\n00:18:00.926 --> 00:18:07.158\nSo CSI, very important and it's throughout\nthe entire lifecycle, we got that.\n\n315\n00:18:07.158 --> 00:18:12.470\nNow speaking of lifecycle, we have so\nmany episodes in the ITIL MALC series.\n\n316\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.316\nWatch them all,\nyou'll be very glad you did.\n\n317\n00:18:14.316 --> 00:18:18.070\nAnd thank you for\nwatching ITProTV, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n318\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm Terry Decker.\n\n319\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.882\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you very soon.\n\n320\n00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:27.556\n[MUSIC]\n\n321\n00:18:27.556 --> 00:18:30.157\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.117\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:11.718\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:15.989\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:18.100\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.855\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC, and\n\n8\n00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.890\nthis is service design across\nthe life cycle, with Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.700\nTerry, good to see you again, I know\nyou've got a lot of information for us.\n\n10\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.437\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, as always,\nI'm happy to be here, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:35.217\nThe big challenge, what I'm focusing\non in these next several episodes,\n\n12\n00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:39.298\nwe've gone through processes, we've\nlooked at the big picture prior to that.\n\n13\n00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.098\nAnd these next several ones\nare gonna be looking at\n\n14\n00:00:42.098 --> 00:00:46.508\nhow each of the life cycle stages has its\ntentacles in other life cycle stages.\n\n15\n00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:51.084\nAnd how those tentacles from\nother life cycle stages infect or\n\n16\n00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.940\naffect service design.\n\n17\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.911\nSo it's about this integration,\nthe tentacles coming together, and\n\n18\n00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.299\nlooking at these things,\nfrom a holistic point of view.\n\n19\n00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.976\nAgain, management across a life cycle is\ntrying to do that very strategic 5000 foot\n\n20\n00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:05.968\nview of how these things\nare intended to work together.\n\n21\n00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:09.452\nIt's strategically mis-minded,\nyou need to know the value,\n\n22\n00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.266\nyou need to know the activities.\n\n23\n00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:16.300\nBut actually you're looking at, how does\nthis equate to the value to the customers?\n\n24\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.351\nSo as we look at the design\nconsiderations here on the graphics,\n\n25\n00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.082\nI like the use of the scale.\n\n26\n00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.514\nBecause service design is\nconstantly trying to weigh\n\n27\n00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:29.416\nthe cost-benefit analysis of\ndifferent design elements.\n\n28\n00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:34.291\nAnd remember, service design is a lot\nmore complicated than solution design.\n\n29\n00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:37.189\nIn that you still have\nto design solutions, but\n\n30\n00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.247\nyou also have to design the policies,\nthe processes around them,\n\n31\n00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:44.950\nto make sure that testing has\ngot the appropriate strategy.\n\n32\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.005\nAll sorts of things have to be played\ninto, this game called service design.\n\n33\n00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.515\nSo getting the right balance,\nhow much money do we have,\n\n34\n00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:53.627\nhow much time do we have?\n\n35\n00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:58.040\nWhat value proposition is actually being\ndelivered here, that sort of thing.\n\n36\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.791\nUnderstanding the endgame,\n\n37\n00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:04.419\nunderstanding your constraints is what\ndesign policy is trying to consider.\n\n38\n00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:07.079\nSo as you move into\nfurther analysis of this,\n\n39\n00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.930\nwhat you're now trying to balance\nis the idea of functionality.\n\n40\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.685\nWhat's it supposed to be doing, the\nutility of it, also the warranty of it,\n\n41\n00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:21.300\nhow robust does it have to be,\nand what resources do you have?\n\n42\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.765\nAnd I appreciate the resources\nbeing identified here as people,\n\n43\n00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:26.030\ntechnology and money.\n\n44\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.747\nThat's really what you have,\nwhat capabilities do you have,\n\n45\n00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.100\nconsider that one of\nthe resources as well.\n\n46\n00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.710\nAnd then of course you\nalso have time scales,\n\n47\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.670\nthe resource of time is\nalso important aspect.\n\n48\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.859\nSo, how many by when and by whom, and\nhow are they gonna get that done,\n\n49\n00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.997\nis really what service design\nis trying to get done.\n\n50\n00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:48.223\nNow, service design necessarily is\ngonna get a lot of their guidance and\n\n51\n00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:51.561\na lot of the constrains defined\nby service strategists.\n\n52\n00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:55.922\nService strategists are gonna be the ones\nthat approve the charter that allows\n\n53\n00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:59.030\nthe service to come to life and\nto be designed.\n\n54\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.620\nThey're providing the money,\nthey are setting the end goal,\n\n55\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.300\nwhat time frame it is.\n\n56\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.970\nSo, service design already has this\ninteraction with service strategy,\n\n57\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.330\nbecause service strategy\nis setting the direction.\n\n58\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.130\nIs providing the resources, or as it\nmight be, not providing the resources.\n\n59\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.400\nSo operating within those\nconstraints as well.\n\n60\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.350\nSo, when you're considering how\ndesign policy then, how you govern\n\n61\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.950\nservice design, you really are considering\nthese three elements of resource,\n\n62\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.420\nschedule and functionality.\n\n63\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.130\nAnd how they apply to strategy and\noverarching governance, and\n\n64\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.170\nby governance, in this context,\nwe're talking about strategic governance.\n\n65\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.193\nI mean, governance happens all the way\nthrough the organization at all levels.\n\n66\n00:03:41.193 --> 00:03:44.438\nBut strategic governance is,\nwhich direction are we going in and\n\n67\n00:03:44.438 --> 00:03:45.680\nwhy we're going there?\n\n68\n00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.516\nAre we trying to satisfy\nregulators in a different way now?\n\n69\n00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:55.392\nImagine financial management organizations\nbefore Sarbanes-Oxley years ago,\n\n70\n00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:59.360\nand the impact that the passage of\nthat legislation had on financial\n\n71\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.350\norganizations, or financial reporting,\nor public companies at large.\n\n72\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.873\nSo a major shift, governance through\nregulations at a strategic level was\n\n73\n00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.897\nchanging that kind of behavior.\n\n74\n00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:15.462\nIf you work in other areas that are highly\nregulated, the change in regulation\n\n75\n00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:19.267\nis obviously gonna affect the way\nyou develop your strategies for\n\n76\n00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:23.718\nimprovement, the way you develop your\nstrategies for business outcomes.\n\n77\n00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:26.654\nCertainly when you consider functionality\nyou're considering what the business is\n\n78\n00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:28.540\ntrying to do,\nyou can see in the lower quadrant there.\n\n79\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.410\nThis all needs to be done in balance,\nif you tip too heavily in one direction,\n\n80\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.440\nyou could upset the apple\ncart in the other.\n\n81\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.325\nSo it's pretty picture, trying to show how\nthese things come together with a fine\n\n82\n00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:42.651\npoint at the top,\nin this magic little pyramid.\n\n83\n00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:46.666\nIn effect, it's a very delicate balancing\nact throughout the service design.\n\n84\n00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:50.097\nAnd the overarching value that\nthese processes bring, and\n\n85\n00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:53.740\ngetting good at these processes\nwithin service design.\n\n86\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.800\nThe overarching value is that you don't\nhave to reinvent the wheel every time\n\n87\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.054\nto keep this balance.\n\n88\n00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:03.246\nYou have repeatable activities,\nrepeatable processes,\n\n89\n00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:06.439\nrepeatable points of sign off and\napproval.\n\n90\n00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.702\nThat are well understood,\nwell practiced, and\n\n91\n00:05:09.702 --> 00:05:14.150\nhave known to be very good\npredictors of actual delivery.\n\n92\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.560\nSo if you get good at this,\nthe balance becomes easier to maintain.\n\n93\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.316\nThat's really what service design\nis trying to get done here.\n\n94\n00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:21.252\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n95\n00:05:22.737 --> 00:05:25.629\n&gt;&gt; So again, keeping the good\ncommunication open as you're trying\n\n96\n00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.790\nto discern the particular requirements.\n\n97\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.290\nHow else can you get stakeholders'\nneeds fully understood,\n\n98\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.820\nand the requirements fully documented?\n\n99\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.080\nNow we realize that service strategy\nis at the forefront of this.\n\n100\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.840\nBRM is a process that's born\nin service strategy, but\n\n101\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.820\nBRM is going to be very high level,\nservice level requirements.\n\n102\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.485\nJust as an example, maybe the BRM process\ndiscerns that this new service for\n\n103\n00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:54.307\nthis new customer needs\nto be available 24/7.\n\n104\n00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:59.374\nWell it's one thing to say 24/7/365,\nthat the service needs to be available.\n\n105\n00:05:59.374 --> 00:06:03.250\nIt's another thing to get into the details\nabout availability, for instance,\n\n106\n00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.273\nto say, well, can we have\nmaintenance periods every Sunday?\n\n107\n00:06:06.273 --> 00:06:09.779\nCan we have a maintenance period\nevery Tuesday for two hours, and\n\n108\n00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.450\nfour hours on Sunday?\n\n109\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.910\nWe need to maintain the system,\nwe gotta provide patches,\n\n110\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.610\nwe gotta upgrade this and fix that.\n\n111\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.703\nCan we target some maintenance windows\nthat are acceptable to you, customer?\n\n112\n00:06:20.703 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd he says, yeah, you can do that.\n\n113\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:28.628\nSo now, instead of 24/7,\nit's 24/7 minus six hours of maintenance,\n\n114\n00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:31.685\n2 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Sunday.\n\n115\n00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:36.314\nSo you've changed the game and gotten to\nthe very details of just how a warranty,\n\n116\n00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:39.190\nin this case availability,\nneed to be targeted.\n\n117\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.783\nYou're expecting 2000 users,\nis that demand accurate?\n\n118\n00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:47.790\nOr are you going to be growing in the next\nsix months or the next three years?\n\n119\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.580\nAre you anticipating a growth spurt\n\n120\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.890\nwhere you expect maybe twice that\nnumber three years from now?\n\n121\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.000\nSo while the initial service\nlevel requirement may suggest\n\n122\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.390\nthat you need to only target for\nthe capacity for 2000 users.\n\n123\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.150\nMaybe you realize the growth is going to\nactually mean that we could triple that\n\n124\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.430\nover the next three years,\nthat's a design consideration.\n\n125\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.550\nSo while these requirements begin to\nbe formulated at the strategic level.\n\n126\n00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.250\nService design is gonna be there to\nreally hone in on the actuals, and\n\n127\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.910\nthe predicted future.\n\n128\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.662\nTrying to be a good forecaster\nof future needs, future demand,\n\n129\n00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:26.656\nfuture capacity,\nsecurity requirements, etc.\n\n130\n00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:31.460\nSo planning for growth is also part of the\nbalance the design needs to bring in too.\n\n131\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.240\nWhat architecture's in place,\nmust we be on the mainframe,\n\n132\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.056\ncan we have a web service,\ndo you want it to be client-server?\n\n133\n00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:41.640\nSometimes the customers\nhave a predisposition, or\n\n134\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.340\nstrategists have a predisposition for what\nthe actual architectural style's gonna be.\n\n135\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.171\nYou need to be there in service design,\nhoning in on that architectural element,\n\n136\n00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:55.194\nto make sure that it's fit for\npurpose and fit for use.\n\n137\n00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:58.142\nThat sort of thing,\nthe high level view comes from strategy.\n\n138\n00:07:58.142 --> 00:08:01.277\nDesign's gonna be looking at\nthe devil in the details.\n\n139\n00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:04.720\nSo again, as you're identifying\nthese service requirements,\n\n140\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.450\nyou see some of the things\nI just talked about.\n\n141\n00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.850\nScalability, how are you\naffecting the business processes?\n\n142\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.580\nI keep going back to this\noil company scenario,\n\n143\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.970\nyou don't have to be a geophysicist.\n\n144\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.440\nBut you need to know what\nthe geophysicist is trying to get done.\n\n145\n00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.940\nYou don't have to be a lawyer but\n\n146\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.260\nyou need to know what is that\nlawyer trying to do, right?\n\n147\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.480\nYou need to understand what\nthe business processes are.\n\n148\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.120\nIf you're in financial management,\nyou don't have to be a financial guru, but\n\n149\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.780\nyou need to know what those financial\nmanagers are trying to get done, etc.\n\n150\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.932\nHopefully that horse is sufficiently\nbeaten, you got that one down.\n\n151\n00:08:37.932 --> 00:08:38.784\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n152\n00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:42.180\n[LAUGH] So\nagreeing to functional requirements.\n\n153\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.030\nThat's the utility piece of things.\n\n154\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:49.250\nAgreeing to the warranty processes, making\nsure you have agreements in place, right?\n\n155\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.090\nService level management is one of\nthose activities that plays out in\n\n156\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.210\nservice design.\n\n157\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.610\nSo quite holistically then, if you're\ntalking about agreements, you're gonna be\n\n158\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.060\nusing SLM for service level agreements and\noperational level agreements.\n\n159\n00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.890\nWhat about your suppliers?\n\n160\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.640\nAre they gonna have to be coming\nalong on this journey as well?\n\n161\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.050\nWhat's your supplier man's regime doing\nto make sure the suppliers are coming\n\n162\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.160\non board?\n\n163\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.830\nAre they ready?\n\n164\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.940\nDo they have the right training?\n\n165\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.660\nDo they have the right capacity?\n\n166\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.730\nCan you trust them with this new service?\n\n167\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.690\nThat sort of thing.\n\n168\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.060\nSo service design is gonna be there not\nonly to ensure that the requirements\n\n169\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.850\nare understood between the service\nprovider and the business, but\n\n170\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.920\nthese are also between the service\nprovider and the suppliers as well.\n\n171\n00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.530\nSo, very important.\n\n172\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.050\nWhat about regulatory requirements?\n\n173\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.280\nWhat about cost constraints?\n\n174\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.300\nWhat about time constraints,\nall these things in play all the time.\n\n175\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.320\nSo if you get good at this,\nif you get good at service design,\n\n176\n00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.890\nthese questions become something\nthat you can easily answer.\n\n177\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.350\nYou have a methodology in place that\ncan easily approach these questions and\n\n178\n00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.880\ncome up with good answers.\n\n179\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.430\nYou are not reinventing\nthe wheel every time.\n\n180\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.100\nSo finding out your requirements,\nin this particular case we're\n\n181\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.190\ntalking about business processes\nacross multiple business units.\n\n182\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.270\nThis graphic is also showing how\nyou need to filter this down into\n\n183\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.920\nthe requirements among the infrastructure.\n\n184\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.720\nRight, so\n\n185\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.430\nit's one thing to understand what the\ntargets are from the business perspective.\n\n186\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.810\nIt's another thing to understand\nhow these targets can be met\n\n187\n00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.220\nfrom the infrastructure perspective or\nfrom the application perspective.\n\n188\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.880\nAnd here's design in the middle.\n\n189\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.480\nRight, not a trivial matter.\n\n190\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.470\nBeginning good at this means you have\nfewer problems in operations later.\n\n191\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.490\nBeing bad at this means you may launch\na lot of services that fail often and\n\n192\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.480\nfail to deliver on the quality\nthat they are intended to deliver,\n\n193\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.680\nto deliver the value that\nthey are supposed to deliver.\n\n194\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.900\nAll right, all right.\n\n195\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.050\nSo, write this stuff down.\n\n196\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.990\nIdentifying and\nDocumenting Business Requirements.\n\n197\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.300\nAnd becoming very methodical to it.\n\n198\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.480\nIf you have any experience in\nthe software development life cycle,\n\n199\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.480\nyou would have scraped your knuckles\non business requirements before.\n\n200\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.440\nIn a software development life cycle,\nbusiness requirements for solutions or\n\n201\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.440\nfor an application are often\ntranslated into system requirements or\n\n202\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.980\nfunctional requirements.\n\n203\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.680\nSo once you start with the baseline on\nwhat the business is trying to do, you\n\n204\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.990\nthen start building on the system and or\nfunctional requirements to satisfy those.\n\n205\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.960\nSo in the software development life cycle,\n\n206\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.650\nyou have a good analogy of what\nhappens in the service life cycle.\n\n207\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.980\nService design life cycle's a little\nbit different than solution design,\n\n208\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.470\nin that you can't just think about\nthe technology, which is also in play.\n\n209\n00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.480\nYou have to think about\nall these other things.\n\n210\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.580\nProcess models, policies, governance,\n\n211\n00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.010\nmeasurement, right, the people,\nwhat training needs to be involved,\n\n212\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.500\ntesting, what testing needs to be\nbrought to bear, all sorts of things.\n\n213\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.920\nAnd ultimately,\nservice acceptance criteria.\n\n214\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.490\nOkay, now, service models.\n\n215\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.250\nService models are effectively\ndesigned between\n\n216\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.500\nservice portfolio management and\nservice design.\n\n217\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.070\nThis is where you're trying to build\nthe right number of services and\n\n218\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.780\nput them in play at the right amount of\ntime in the right amount of expensive to\n\n219\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.320\nsatisfy the business outcomes\nthat they that are being sought.\n\n220\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.080\nThis is an example.\n\n221\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.990\nA service model for\n\n222\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:25.280\ncommunications within an organisation\ncould include a blend of telephones,\n\n223\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.390\ninstant messaging, email,\nmaybe even hard copy mail.\n\n224\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.040\nHard copy things could also\nbe part of the service model.\n\n225\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.230\nIT can help in all those, right?\n\n226\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.430\nThey could help in all those\ntypes of environments.\n\n227\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.320\nSo your service model satisfying\nthe business process,\n\n228\n00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.150\ncommunication could have\nseveral moving pieces.\n\n229\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.970\nNow, what's underneath those services?\n\n230\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.430\nEmail, instant messaging.\n\n231\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.670\nWhat's underneath those?\n\n232\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.475\nYou have servers underneath those.\n\n233\n00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:57.970\nYou've got database systems underneath\nthose or services underneath those.\n\n234\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.160\nYou have network services.\n\n235\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.080\nYou have identity management services.\n\n236\n00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.340\nSo now, it's not just a first layer\nof service modeling you have to\n\n237\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.800\nbe concerned with about how you create\nthe right types of services to satisfy\n\n238\n00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.300\nthat business process of communication.\n\n239\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.360\nYou also have to consider\nthe underlying services and\n\n240\n00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.520\nhow they are presented to\nsupport this model of services.\n\n241\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.590\nSo, service modeling has layers.\n\n242\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.080\nIt's having the right mix of layers and\n\n243\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.030\nthe right amount of expense\nat the right amount of time,\n\n244\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.650\nthe right amount of effort at the right\namount of time for the business outcomes.\n\n245\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.570\nNow, email is one of those things I mean,\nwhat's the value of email?\n\n246\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.700\nHow do you put a return on investment,\npotentially, on that?\n\n247\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.070\nTake email away for a week and\nsee what the value of email is, right?\n\n248\n00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:41.870\nI mean, I think you'd get that.\n\n249\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.630\nMaybe some people would say yea,\nplease take it away, take it away.\n\n250\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.590\nI don't wanna see my inbox again, right?\n\n251\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:52.810\nI totally get that as well, but,\nmy point there is, while it's easy in some\n\n252\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:58.170\ncases to quantify the value of a given\nservice, some things are just expected.\n\n253\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.540\nAnd that's one of the unfortunate\ndichotomies of IT\n\n254\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.810\nservice management sometimes, is if you're\nreally good at delivering something,\n\n255\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.840\nyou don't get a pat on the back,\nit's just expected.\n\n256\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.030\nRight, and that's the case\nwith some of the commodity or\n\n257\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.320\nbaseline types of services.\n\n258\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.168\nEveryone expects email.\n\n259\n00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:18.877\nEveryone expects it to work,\nexpects us to be there every day and\n\n260\n00:14:18.877 --> 00:14:23.013\nit could be an extraordinary effort\nto invest in that type of delivery.\n\n261\n00:14:23.013 --> 00:14:25.950\n99.9% availability.\n\n262\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.170\nPlenty of space for all your email,\nyou never delete a thing,\n\n263\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.390\nyou got your email from eight years ago,\nyeah, we got it covered for you,\n\n264\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.280\nall that storage issues, right?\n\n265\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.210\nManaging the storage,\nmanaging the access, right?\n\n266\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.920\nAll sorts of things, and yet,\nit just becomes an expectation.\n\n267\n00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.050\nSo service design is there to\nunderstand those expectations and\n\n268\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.870\ndeliver on them in a delightful way,\nbasically.\n\n269\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.150\nSo, that's what a service model is.\n\n270\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.630\nGetting the right things built to\nsatisfy those business processes.\n\n271\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.220\n&gt;&gt; In the most delightful way.\n\n272\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.310\n&gt;&gt; In the most delightful way as you can.\n\n273\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.740\nThat's right.\nWe can sing, right.\n\n274\n00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.040\n&gt;&gt; I almost broke into it.\n\n275\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.600\n&gt;&gt; You almost did.\n\n276\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.321\nI can appreciate that.\n\n277\n00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:01.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Spoonful of sugar,\nis that where that comes from?\n\n278\n00:15:01.982 --> 00:15:03.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right, exactly right.\n\n279\n00:15:03.534 --> 00:15:04.034\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n280\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:10.080\nAgain, service modelling, just to recap on\nthis, service modelling is making sure you\n\n281\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.890\nhave the right number of services to\nsatisfy these business processes.\n\n282\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:19.150\nGoing back to the oil company, they want\nto find the oil, they want to extract\n\n283\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.670\nthe oil, I mean this is high level, do you\nhave services that helps them find it?\n\n284\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.640\nDo you have services that\nhelp them attract it?\n\n285\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.690\nDo you have services that\nhelps them distribute it?\n\n286\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.580\nThat sort of things.\n\n287\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.340\nWhat does IT bring in their services\n\n288\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.520\nthat help the business get\nthat stuff done, right.\n\n289\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.640\nNow in that stuff there's\nalso the sub categories.\n\n290\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.940\nIt's not just about extracting it or\njust finding it.\n\n291\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.340\nIt's finding it quickly.\n\n292\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.560\nIt's finding it safely, right?\n\n293\n00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.910\nIs finding it within\nregulatory constrains, right?\n\n294\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.422\nSo, again, IT can help with those\nsubsets of business out comes or\n\n295\n00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:52.800\nprocesses as well.\n\n296\n00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.598\nComing up with the right services, they\nsatisfy those business processes as well,\n\n297\n00:15:56.598 --> 00:15:58.427\nthis is what service modeling is about.\n\n298\n00:15:58.427 --> 00:16:01.050\nA lot of these happens\nin service strategy.\n\n299\n00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.433\nBut service design must be there,\n\n300\n00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:07.304\nto understand what the models\nare intended to deliver.\n\n301\n00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:10.429\nAnd make sure that the right\nbalance of investment and\n\n302\n00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:14.767\nresource utilization is brought to\nbear on those service models, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:14.767 --> 00:16:15.881\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n304\n00:16:15.881 --> 00:16:20.957\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, doing all this work,\nservice design, getting all this done.\n\n305\n00:16:20.957 --> 00:16:24.489\nSpecifically through the process\ncalled design coordination,\n\n306\n00:16:24.489 --> 00:16:27.710\nultimately ends up with\na deliverable that's huge.\n\n307\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.070\nIt's called the service design package.\n\n308\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.722\nNow it sounds so succinct and\neasy, service design package.\n\n309\n00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:38.279\nJust deliver the service design package,\nand service transition will have\n\n310\n00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:41.514\neverything they need to know,\nto build and bring this thing to life.\n\n311\n00:16:41.514 --> 00:16:42.965\nBut it's not a trivial matter.\n\n312\n00:16:43.975 --> 00:16:49.205\nFrom my own experience, the service\ndesign package, it grew over time, right?\n\n313\n00:16:49.205 --> 00:16:53.435\nWe started off with what amounted to\na check list, and it had 100 items on it.\n\n314\n00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:59.165\nHere's the 100 questions you should\nanswer with reasonable confidence,\n\n315\n00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:00.729\nbefore you agree to funding.\n\n316\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.750\nAnd then we grew to 150,\nto include a few things,\n\n317\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.920\nit says, before you agree to\ngo to transition, all right.\n\n318\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.640\nThen it came up with a few more options,\nit says before you agree to go to\n\n319\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.260\noperations, right,\nall these types of things.\n\n320\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.920\nSo all of these things, and what I mean\nby things, are actually deliverables.\n\n321\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.840\nWe talked about the business\nrequirements document earlier.\n\n322\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.150\nYou document the business requirements.\n\n323\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.750\nYou document system and\nfunctional requirements.\n\n324\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.160\nYou document a test strategy,\nyou document a test plan, right?\n\n325\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.605\nYou document a service architecture.\n\n326\n00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:36.935\nYou document a system architecture.\n\n327\n00:17:36.935 --> 00:17:38.965\nYou might document\nan organizational architecture,\n\n328\n00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:41.675\nhow the organization\ninteracts with each other.\n\n329\n00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:44.195\nYou might document a change\nmanagement process.\n\n330\n00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:47.535\nYou might document a brand new\nincident management process.\n\n331\n00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:51.915\nYou might document lots of things as\npart of introducing a new service,\n\n332\n00:17:51.915 --> 00:17:55.050\na replaced model, a changed model, etc.\n\n333\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.750\nAnd all those things,\nall those deliverables,\n\n334\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.070\nall those documents are formulated\ninto a service design package.\n\n335\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.750\nNow in terms of execution, you might get\nlost and say well, how does that work?\n\n336\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.890\nI got 78 different documents here,\nor 170 different documents,\n\n337\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.350\nhowever many documents it might be.\n\n338\n00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.800\nI got this number of documents that,\n\n339\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.600\nwould these documents have answered all\nthe questions that need to be answered?\n\n340\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.980\nI know what my availability\nmanagement plan is,\n\n341\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.690\nI know what my security management\nplan is, all those types of things.\n\n342\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.280\nI got all these things,\nhow do I package it?\n\n343\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.850\nYou might get lost in that\nparticular challenge.\n\n344\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.660\nWhat's that data model look like,\nor how is that done?\n\n345\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.820\nDon't get lost in that,\nespecially on the exam.\n\n346\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.460\nGetting lost back at the operations,\nI can give you a hint about that.\n\n347\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:43.100\nBut in terms of the exam itself,\ndon't worry about the data model.\n\n348\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.980\nUnderstand the value of\nthe service design package.\n\n349\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.152\nUnderstand that it's a big thing\nthat has lots of answers to\n\n350\n00:18:49.152 --> 00:18:50.809\nlots of important questions.\n\n351\n00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:55.140\nAnd that it's a deliverable that's done\nearly in a life cycle of a service.\n\n352\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.825\nBy early, I mean, in service design.\n\n353\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.990\nNow, operationally speaking, when you\nconsider the service design package,\n\n354\n00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.030\nI can only give you some\nof my own experience.\n\n355\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.933\nIn this regard,\n\n356\n00:19:03.933 --> 00:19:08.480\nthe way we executed a service design\npackage should start it off as a list.\n\n357\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.740\nJust imagine an Excel spreadsheet\nwith a few lines on it.\n\n358\n00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.430\nThe lines kept getting,\nwe kept getting more and\n\n359\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.760\nmore lines, right, but\nthey described it deliverable.\n\n360\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.200\nHave business requirements been approved?\n\n361\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.290\nYes, just a simple check box, yes it has,\nno it hasn't, no it's gonna be,\n\n362\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.870\nmaybe a comments section, all right?\n\n363\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.595\nSystem requirements, functional\nrequirements, design spec, all those\n\n364\n00:19:31.595 --> 00:19:35.569\nthings, whatever it might be that you need\nto answer ends up with a deliverable.\n\n365\n00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:39.870\nAnd simply ask the question,\nhas it been delivered, right?\n\n366\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.380\nAnd, if it has been delivered, how about\na column over here to the far right,\n\n367\n00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.820\nthat just links to it somewhere, right?\n\n368\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.610\nMaybe to a document repository, or maybe\nto a SharePoint list, for that matter.\n\n369\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.240\nSo, we created basically what\namounted to an electronic\n\n370\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.192\nway to capture the service design package.\n\n371\n00:19:56.192 --> 00:20:00.490\nIt started off as a checklist,\nit evolved to a way, from the checklist,\n\n372\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.402\nget to the actual deliverable.\n\n373\n00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:06.810\nAnd it ultimately became the touchstone\nthroughout the design process, and\n\n374\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.990\nthroughout the transition process.\n\n375\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.495\nAnd even used in service operations,\nto go and\n\n376\n00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:16.310\nfind the appropriate artifacts at\nthe appropriate time for troubleshooting.\n\n377\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.710\nAnd what's the architectural diagram?\n\n378\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.983\nWell, I'll look at\nthe services design package,\n\n379\n00:20:18.983 --> 00:20:20.550\nbecause I know they created one of those.\n\n380\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.175\nI go to the architecture, okay,\nhere's what this server does,\n\n381\n00:20:23.175 --> 00:20:24.191\nit hooks off to this one.\n\n382\n00:20:24.191 --> 00:20:27.080\nMaybe we need to troubleshoot this\ninterface, that sort of thing.\n\n383\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.482\nSo they have a life cycle,\nthese deliverables,\n\n384\n00:20:30.482 --> 00:20:33.270\nthat serve the design process very well.\n\n385\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.185\nThey have a life cycle that serves\nthe transition life cycle very well.\n\n386\n00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:39.762\nAnd these same deliverables\nin the service design\n\n387\n00:20:39.762 --> 00:20:42.910\npackage can also serve\nservices operations well.\n\n388\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.910\nSo, that's how service design can impact\nthe entire life cycle of a service.\n\n389\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.320\n&gt;&gt; All the pieces of that puzzle\nfit very nicely, thank you.\n\n390\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.340\n&gt;&gt; Good, glad to hear that.\n\n391\n00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.450\nNow, policies, principles and basic\nconcepts with the service design package,\n\n392\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.090\nthat kind of got played out here.\n\n393\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.910\nOne of the earliest things you\ncan get Is a service charter.\n\n394\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.126\nThis is the decision and\n\n395\n00:21:02.126 --> 00:21:04.930\nthe announcement that the service\nis gonna be brought to life.\n\n396\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.724\nIt describes the major role players,\nthe major stakeholders,\n\n397\n00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:10.219\nthe value that the service is\nsupposed to be delivering.\n\n398\n00:21:10.219 --> 00:21:13.790\nThe timeline for when the service\nis gonna be brought to life,\n\n399\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.270\nand perhaps even its intended lifecycle.\n\n400\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.086\nIt's a five-year plan to\nhave this service in place,\n\n401\n00:21:19.086 --> 00:21:22.590\nit's gonna be replaced by a different\nservice five years from now.\n\n402\n00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.820\nThe service charter would have\nthat kind of detail in it.\n\n403\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.040\nWhat is its strategic objective,\nwhy are we doing this?\n\n404\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.785\nHere are the major stakeholders,\nhave a nice design day, basically.\n\n405\n00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:34.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The service charter is doing that.\n\n406\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.940\nAll right, it's a public assessment\nof why we're doing the service.\n\n407\n00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.290\nThis also includes the expected\nutility and warranty.\n\n408\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.120\nAnd then you get into those other things,\nthe service specifications,\n\n409\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.220\nthe service model,\nthe architectural diagrams.\n\n410\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.610\nAll those things that may be\na meaningful deliverable.\n\n411\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.140\nWhat's the availability management plan,\nwhat's the security plan look like?\n\n412\n00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.931\nDo we need a new process for incident\nmanagement, because the one we have now is\n\n413\n00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:01.754\nnot gonna be scalable enough\nto this particular service?\n\n414\n00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:08.334\nDo we need a request fulfillment model,\nto satisfy the demand for headsets, right?\n\n415\n00:22:08.334 --> 00:22:11.077\nI'll give you an example\nfrom my own experience,\n\n416\n00:22:11.077 --> 00:22:14.700\nwe had introduced a learning\nmanagement service.\n\n417\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.990\nIn effect, what we had done is we\nintroduced a learning management system.\n\n418\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.797\nWe didn't really think the holistic\napproach to service, to be quite honest.\n\n419\n00:22:22.797 --> 00:22:26.829\nAnd as we launched this new\nlearning management system,\n\n420\n00:22:26.829 --> 00:22:33.110\none of the business propositions was,\nyou can convert PowerPoints to eLearning.\n\n421\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.510\nSo when you people were getting people in\na classroom, and showing a PowerPoint,\n\n422\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.760\nwe can make that easier to deliver\nby converting it to eLearning.\n\n423\n00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.700\nBut we didn't build that service,\n\n424\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.770\nwe didn't build the Powerpoint\nconversion service.\n\n425\n00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.880\nWe just said the system can support it,\nright?\n\n426\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.684\nSo then the business, all these many\npractitioners in the business in the large\n\n427\n00:22:53.684 --> 00:22:55.750\norganization, they started calling IT.\n\n428\n00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.633\nSaying, hey, we like this new\nlearning management system, and\n\n429\n00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:03.736\nwe heard we could convert PowerPoints\nto e-learning, I want that.\n\n430\n00:23:03.736 --> 00:23:06.595\nGood, have a nice day.\n\n431\n00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:08.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We weren't ready for it, right?\n\n432\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.540\nSo when you consider request models,\n\n433\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.350\nthat could be part of service design,\nbe ready for that.\n\n434\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.134\nIf you're promising that\nthe value proposition for\n\n435\n00:23:17.134 --> 00:23:21.183\na given service is X, and\npart of delivering X is Y and Z?\n\n436\n00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:24.164\nThen you'd better have Y and\nZ in the backroom, ready to go,\n\n437\n00:23:24.164 --> 00:23:26.040\nis what this is talking about.\n\n438\n00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.960\nSo coming up with those various things,\n\n439\n00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.800\nthose various deliverables, is what\nservice design package is geared to do.\n\n440\n00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.760\nAnd that could go many\ndifferent directions.\n\n441\n00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.160\nMaybe there's not a need to have\na request fulfillment model for\n\n442\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.780\nthe service you're introducing,\nmaybe there is.\n\n443\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.420\nAnswer the question, right?\n\n444\n00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.508\nIf there's not a need for\na request fulfillment model, check no,\n\n445\n00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:45.620\nyou're good, right?\n\n446\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.592\nIf there is a need for one,\nthen who's delivering it?\n\n447\n00:23:48.592 --> 00:23:52.466\nLet's sign it out, right, make sure it's\ndelivered on time and ready to go, and\n\n448\n00:23:52.466 --> 00:23:54.336\nit's fully tested before you launch.\n\n449\n00:23:56.879 --> 00:23:59.108\nAll right, big important thing\nhere at the bottom here,\n\n450\n00:23:59.108 --> 00:24:02.090\nthe service acceptance criteria,\nlet me get my laser pointer right quick.\n\n451\n00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.930\nThe service acceptance criteria,\nnot a trivial matter,\n\n452\n00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.220\nit's one bullet I wanna highlight.\n\n453\n00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.530\nThere's lots of deliverables, but service\ndesign is gonna be very explicit about\n\n454\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.020\nwhat success looks like\nbefore you go live, right?\n\n455\n00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.350\nSo before we accept this into\nthe production live environment,\n\n456\n00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.320\nwhat does success look like?\n\n457\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.750\nAll tests have passed, right?\n\n458\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.560\nAll risks have been mitigated to\na satisfactory level as approved by\n\n459\n00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.760\nJoe Blow and Mary Market,\nwhoever it might be, right?\n\n460\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.620\nYou're accepting the criteria,\nyou're stating what the criteria is.\n\n461\n00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.290\nWhen Joe and Mary say that the risks\nhave been mitigated effectively enough,\n\n462\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.290\nwe'll consider that good enough for\nus, that type of thing.\n\n463\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:52.530\nWhen all the tests have passed,\nwhen the load balancing tests,\n\n464\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.400\nthe service integration tests,\nthe system integration tests,\n\n465\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.720\nwhen the processes have been completed,\nwhen training has been completed.\n\n466\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.260\nWhatever the acceptance criteria is,\nwrite them down,\n\n467\n00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:08.350\nand we'll consider ourselves ready to go\nwhen these things have been accomplished.\n\n468\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:13.473\nAnd then you use that as your checklist\nthere in service transition to say,\n\n469\n00:25:13.473 --> 00:25:17.885\nI gotta satisfy this criteria\nbefore I go live, simple as that.\n\n470\n00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:19.903\nNotice when this is happening,\n\n471\n00:25:19.903 --> 00:25:23.573\nservice acceptance criteria\nis not figured out later on.\n\n472\n00:25:23.573 --> 00:25:26.966\nIt's figured out early in the life cycle,\nso\n\n473\n00:25:26.966 --> 00:25:33.052\nyou know what success looks like before\nyou launch, simple as that, all right.\n\n474\n00:25:33.052 --> 00:25:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Covering all your bases.\n\n475\n00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right, now service design\ninteraction with service transition\n\n476\n00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.180\nis gonna be highly influenced by policies.\n\n477\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.790\nWell one thing I just mentioned, service\nacceptance criteria, you will not go live\n\n478\n00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:51.380\nunless all service acceptance\ncriteria has been satisfied, right?\n\n479\n00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.220\nExceptions to this policy must be\nreviewed by senior vice president, or\n\n480\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:56.990\nsomething like that.\n\n481\n00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.644\nSo if you have a policy that backs\nup this interaction of discipline\n\n482\n00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:03.400\nbetween the two stages.\n\n483\n00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.981\nIf you have a policy that says thou shalt\ndo this, and not just a process that\n\n484\n00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:11.979\ndescribes how to do it, then you\nhave a bit more meat on that bone,\n\n485\n00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:17.270\na little bit more driving, buy-in, if you\nwill, from the executives, all right.\n\n486\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.160\nSo in my own experience,\nthat was a challenge.\n\n487\n00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.580\nI guess it always is, to make sure that\nif you create a process, some people will\n\n488\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.120\nembrace it, other peoples will scoff at\nit and say it's just another process.\n\n489\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.910\nI've been doing it this way for years,\nI don't need to change my behavior, right?\n\n490\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.290\nSo you get in the varying range,\nI just refuse to follow a process\n\n491\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.750\nall the way up to thank you very much for\nprocess and all points in-between.\n\n492\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.475\nWell, the way you can kinda drive some\nadherence to process is through policy,\n\n493\n00:26:44.475 --> 00:26:46.200\nit's just part of governance.\n\n494\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.979\nSo if you're trying to\ndrive from service design\n\n495\n00:26:48.979 --> 00:26:53.740\ninto service transition some certain\nbehaviors, then policy can come into play.\n\n496\n00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.804\nWe're gonna have a good lesson\na little bit later on on governance,\n\n497\n00:26:56.804 --> 00:26:58.930\nan episode on governance a bit later on.\n\n498\n00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.950\nAnd we'll remind ourselves then, or\nre-energize our learning then just how\n\n499\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:07.879\nimportant governance is to this\nfabric of IT service management.\n\n500\n00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.640\nOkay, so now as you're in service\ntransition, you'd be looking at policies.\n\n501\n00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.539\nNow this is where we kinda get in\na transitions phase from service design to\n\n502\n00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:21.470\nservice transition, to mix the language.\n\n503\n00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:25.455\nAs you move from service\ndesign to service transition,\n\n504\n00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:30.840\npolicy can help and you also consider\nwhat kind of activity this is.\n\n505\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.868\nNow, if it's a major release,\na minor release or an emergency release.\n\n506\n00:27:34.868 --> 00:27:38.370\nI mean, obviously emergency releases\nare things you gotta do right now.\n\n507\n00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.890\nMinor releases could be like\nbreak fix things along the way.\n\n508\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.280\nMajor releases could be something as\n\n509\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.560\nbig as replacing your Lotus Notes\nplatform with Exchange.\n\n510\n00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.630\nThat's a big change, right?\n\n511\n00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:58.055\nSo what is a major, what is a minor,\nwhat is an emergency change or a release?\n\n512\n00:27:58.055 --> 00:28:01.965\nAll those factors affect some decisions\nbeing made at the design level as you're\n\n513\n00:28:01.965 --> 00:28:04.435\ntrying to design these solutions.\n\n514\n00:28:04.435 --> 00:28:07.835\nSo that's kind of a point of\ninterface between design and\n\n515\n00:28:07.835 --> 00:28:11.895\ntransition is how big a deal is this,\nright?\n\n516\n00:28:11.895 --> 00:28:13.075\nAnother way to put this is,\n\n517\n00:28:13.075 --> 00:28:18.640\nnot all design decisions have to follow\nthe same amount of rigor, right?\n\n518\n00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.230\nA major release is gonna\nget a bit more concerns and\n\n519\n00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.710\nhave a bit more rigor\nthan a minor release.\n\n520\n00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.593\nEmergency releases obviously have\na sense of urgency that the other ones\n\n521\n00:28:26.593 --> 00:28:27.620\ndon't as well.\n\n522\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.720\nSo how does that play in\nto design considerations?\n\n523\n00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.898\nSo we'll be looking at service transition\nprocesses in a bit more detail in the next\n\n524\n00:28:34.898 --> 00:28:35.445\nepisode.\n\n525\n00:28:35.445 --> 00:28:37.870\nBut that's all we have now for\nservice design.\n\n526\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.039\n&gt;&gt; Service Design Across the Lifecycle,\nthis is ITIL MALC,\n\n527\n00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:47.110\nthere's lots of episodes\nin the ITIL MALC series.\n\n528\n00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.900\nWatch them all,\nyou'll be very glad you did.\n\n529\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.448\nTerry, awesome job as usual.\n\n530\n00:28:50.448 --> 00:28:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; And thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n531\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.320\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n532\n00:28:57.320 -->

00:00:29.180\nas I call him Sherlock Terry.\n\n10\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you,\nDoctor Watson as always.\n\n11\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.960\n&gt;&gt; As always.\n\n12\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.140\n&gt;&gt; So, here we are moving through the past\n\n13\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.630\nthe value propositions of each of\nthe processes in each of the stages.\n\n14\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.120\nAnd now moving into how these\nstages interact with each other.\n\n15\n00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.650\nThey get their tentacles wrapped\naround each other somewhat.\n\n16\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.980\nSo these feedback loops between design and\ntransition,\n\n17\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.660\nbetween transition and strategy,\nbetween operations and\n\n18\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.690\ndesign, all these feedback loops is what\nwe're trying to build out and understand.\n\n19\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.350\nAcademically speaking, what I mean\nby that, as you're taking the exam,\n\n20\n00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.410\nunderstanding or\nrecognizing potential fault lines\n\n21\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.040\namong the communication loops, or\nthe feedback loops between the stages,\n\n22\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.000\nis an important aspect of MALC, or\nmanagement across the life cycle.\n\n23\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.880\nIn each of the other intermediate exams,\n\n24\n00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.030\nyou're always operating within that\nlittle silo of that intermediate exam.\n\n25\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.190\nMALC is not in a silo, it's got\nthe entire lifecycle in front of you and\n\n26\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.600\nyou have to manage across it, right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.980\nThat's the challenge here.\n\n28\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.355\nSo you can expect on the exam that\nyou're going to get some questions\n\n29\n00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:37.375\nthat kind of dissect\nthe interactions among the processes\n\n30\n00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.875\nacross stages as well the interaction\nacross stages themselves.\n\n31\n00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:45.620\nSo that's what we're exploring now is how\nthese stages interact across other ones.\n\n32\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.260\nWe had an episode just now on design, and\n\n33\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.900\nnow we're talking about\nservice transition.\n\n34\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.035\nAnd as we look at the graphic here then,\nyou'll see, again,\n\n35\n00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:58.810\nlinking back to design or straightaway,\nis a Service Design Package.\n\n36\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.280\nWe talked about how it's answering all\nthe questions that service transition\n\n37\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.450\nneeds to successfully bring\nthis service to life, right?\n\n38\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.870\nSo it's actually asking\nquestions about exit and\n\n39\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.240\nentry criteria and\nwhere are the quality gates along the way.\n\n40\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.389\nSo have we signed off on\nbusiness requirements?\n\n41\n00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.360\nThat's one of the quality\ngates particularly, right?\n\n42\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.910\nThere could be many different gates\nas you go through the process.\n\n43\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.090\nThis also could affect\nproject management gates,\n\n44\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.090\nlike when do you get your approvals?\n\n45\n00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.210\nWhen do you get additional funding?\n\n46\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.900\nMaybe you have a particular service that\nyou want to design under one project and\n\n47\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.199\ndo a review, and\nthen approve the transition project.\n\n48\n00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.337\nI mean, that's possible, I wouldn't say\nthat was common, but it's also possible\n\n49\n00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:48.320\nthat you could break down these two\ninto separate different projects.\n\n50\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.080\nMore commonly,\nthis is considered as a single project.\n\n51\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.450\nYou're gonna design, transition and\nbring to life a new service.\n\n52\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.030\nIt's probably under the auspices of\na single project management scope,\n\n53\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.530\nin most cases.\n\n54\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.140\nWhatever that might be, however you\ndecide to dissect the project planning,\n\n55\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.590\nthe actual gates of approval or\n\n56\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.140\ngates of acceptance are built into\nthrough the Service Design Package.\n\n57\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.470\nSo, by the time it gets to transition,\ntransition has, basically,\n\n58\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.460\ntheir path laid out in front of them.\n\n59\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.830\nBut I got to say, service design did\nnot make these decisions in a vacuum.\n\n60\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.240\nThey were working with the transition\nfolks to understand these quality gates\n\n61\n00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.570\nall along, right?\n\n62\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.340\nSo that SDP wasn't formed in a back alley,\n\n63\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.520\nin a back room with no lights on, they\nwere interacting with the other processes.\n\n64\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.402\nUnderstanding what is acceptable?\n\n65\n00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:41.545\nWhat is the current throughput you have?\n\n66\n00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:43.535\nWhat's the current workload you have?\n\n67\n00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:46.070\nWhat's the current capabilities you have?\n\n68\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.790\nCan we do this?\n\n69\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.210\nWhat about that?\n\n70\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.047\nSo service design is not gonna be\nmaking these decisions in a vacuum.\n\n71\n00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:55.170\nThey're going to be working with\ntransition to build these things out.\n\n72\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.790\nSo I think what we're saying here is,\nthat service design as a stage,\n\n73\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.700\ngets finalized before\nyou get into transition.\n\n74\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.780\nI kind of like that way of thinking.\n\n75\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.768\nBut that doesn't mean the service\ndesign operates by itself.\n\n76\n00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.020\nThese things are going to be coordinated.\n\n77\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.470\nSo as you can see here, typical transition\nthrough the lifecycle stages here, right?\n\n78\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.330\nAcquire and\ntest the new configuration items.\n\n79\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.870\nBuilding and testing.\n\n80\n00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.200\nYou have a service release test,\n\n81\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.170\nthat's not just system release,\nyou test the release of the service.\n\n82\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.540\nBasically, you're validating that the\nservice acceptance criteria has been met,\n\n83\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.440\nthat's what the service release test is.\n\n84\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.150\nOperational readiness test.\n\n85\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.780\nHave they been trained?\n\n86\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.170\nIs the service desk ready?\n\n87\n00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.600\nIs the supplier ready?\n\n88\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.810\nAre we ready to tun the lights\non in this brand new service?\n\n89\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.373\nAre we ready to go?\n\n90\n00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:45.896\nAnd of course,\nonce readiness is determined,\n\n91\n00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.510\nthere's actually the steps of deployment.\n\n92\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.454\nYou get this thing out on the streets,\nyou make it live.\n\n93\n00:04:52.454 --> 00:04:55.846\nAnd then you provide early life support,\nearly care support,\n\n94\n00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:59.440\nsometimes this is called\na warranty period in the industry.\n\n95\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.440\nOf course warranty has a very specific\nname at ITIL, so we avoid that term here.\n\n96\n00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.050\nBut it just means that after you launch,\nyou have the period where the project\n\n97\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.195\nremains alive and support remains\ninside the project as you hand over\n\n98\n00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:19.550\nto operations just as caretaker status\nwhile you get to service things.\n\n99\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.080\nAnd then, of course, you review and close.\n\n100\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.906\nSo transition has lots\nof things to do here.\n\n101\n00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:27.718\nNow can you imagine just now how these\ncould be interacting with the stages\n\n102\n00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:29.960\nimmediately before and after.\n\n103\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.366\nCertainly accepting and\ntesting the new CIs.\n\n104\n00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:36.805\nService Designed has already designed what\nkind of services we're supposed to have,\n\n105\n00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:40.814\nyou know, build this kind of system,\nconfigure it with this kind of network,\n\n106\n00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:42.970\nconfigure it with this type of security.\n\n107\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.965\nSo these CIs that are being\nbuilt have been determined by\n\n108\n00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:49.610\nthe Service Design folks.\n\n109\n00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.110\nBuilding and\ntesting an activity within transition\n\n110\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.000\nas you move on toward operations,\nyou're probably gonna have\n\n111\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.290\na lot of coordination at\nthe deployment level with operations.\n\n112\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.560\nCertainly through the early life support,\n\n113\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.590\nyou're gonna be interacting\nwith operations.\n\n114\n00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.830\nAnd indeed interacting with operations\nas you consider the review and\n\n115\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.490\nclosure activities.\n\n116\n00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.340\nDon't go away too soon,\noperations might say,\n\n117\n00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.790\nyou got a fire to put out over here,\nthat sort of thing, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.350\nHow does service transition interact\nwith the lifecycle stage you see here?\n\n119\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.890\nCertainly the interaction\nbetween service design and\n\n120\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.200\nservice transition\nare very tightly linked.\n\n121\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.620\nThere's a lot of conversation\nbetween these two disciplines.\n\n122\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.280\nIn fact, if you look at\nthe design coordination process\n\n123\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.040\nwithin service design, and\nthe transition, planning, and\n\n124\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.000\nsupport process within service transition,\nyou'll see that they have common goals.\n\n125\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.480\nThey just have a little bit\ndifferent area of responsibility.\n\n126\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.353\nTransition planning and\nsupport is responsible for\n\n127\n00:06:46.353 --> 00:06:48.410\neverything that happens in transition.\n\n128\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.040\nDesign coordination is responsible for\neverything that happens in service design.\n\n129\n00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.165\nIf you can connect these two processes,\ndesign coordination and\n\n130\n00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:59.750\ntransition planning and support,\nyou are also connecting the dots for\n\n131\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.730\nthe holistic project management approach,\nright?\n\n132\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.620\nSo these two processes are going\nto be tightly integrated.\n\n133\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.800\nSo now imagine that at a people level,\nat a personal level.\n\n134\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.170\nYou have people that are practicing\nthe design coordination process and\n\n135\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.420\npeople that are practicing the transition,\nplanning, and support process.\n\n136\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.890\nChances are those two people might be\nformed into one project manager, right?\n\n137\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.605\nJust as an example, these two\nstages will be tightly integrated,\n\n138\n00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:31.715\nperhaps that integration actually\nhappens at a project management level.\n\n139\n00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:34.735\nITIL is certainly inviting\nthat consideration by putting\n\n140\n00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:38.225\nproject management scope\nwithin transition planning and\n\n141\n00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:40.185\nsupport, and within design coordination.\n\n142\n00:07:40.185 --> 00:07:41.905\nThat's where the handshake happens, right?\n\n143\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.090\nOther relationships are delivered by how\nmobile is your staff, where are they?\n\n144\n00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.550\nIf you have two different people design\ncoordinator and the transition and\n\n145\n00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.980\nplanning support person where are they?\n\n146\n00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.310\nCan they easily talk to each other?\n\n147\n00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.136\nCan they easily interact?\n\n148\n00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:02.700\nIs it a global organization that\nmakes that easy or makes that hard?\n\n149\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.150\nHow can we get these synergies\nacross your organization?\n\n150\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.830\nAs you look at the MALC exam and\n\n151\n00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.170\nsome of the challenges there,\ngeography could play into it.\n\n152\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.570\nMaking sure that you have some\n\n153\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.280\nmobility built into the interaction\namong these practitioners is important.\n\n154\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.750\nSo whether you move people around or\nbuild the ability for\n\n155\n00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.512\nthem to virtually connect could\nbe a challenge it plays out.\n\n156\n00:08:28.512 --> 00:08:33.000\nAnd process communications,\nhow do processes talk to each other?\n\n157\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.479\nService transitions is going to make sure\nthat the processes of change management,\n\n158\n00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:41.203\nrelease and deploy management\nare inter-operating with testing and\n\n159\n00:08:41.203 --> 00:08:43.450\nvalidation, change evaluation.\n\n160\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.318\nAnd even, talking back to service design,\nin the service acceptance criteria.\n\n161\n00:08:48.318 --> 00:08:52.170\nMaybe, you gotta tweak the criteria\na little bit, so you get another sign off.\n\n162\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.206\nMaybe, one of your system\nrequirements is satisfying,\n\n163\n00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:57.928\none of the business\nrequirements really well, but\n\n164\n00:08:57.928 --> 00:09:00.664\nnot satisfying the other\none it's intended to do.\n\n165\n00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:05.260\nSo you have to regroup on\nthe requirements sign-off?\n\n166\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.250\nAll those things are possible in midstream\n\n167\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.090\nto have interactions across those life\ncycle stages, very important ones.\n\n168\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.460\nHow would transition interact\nwith service strategy?\n\n169\n00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.316\nLet me put this in another way,\nwhat would service strategist need to know\n\n170\n00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:28.646\nabout service transition to make a wise\ndecision about funding, as an example?\n\n171\n00:09:28.646 --> 00:09:33.106\nService strategists could make a wise\ndecision about funding without knowing\n\n172\n00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:36.600\nthe capabilities that\nservice transition has.\n\n173\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.680\nWhat are you current strengths?\n\n174\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.880\nWhat is your workload now?\n\n175\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.740\nWhat is your current capability?\n\n176\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.610\nDo you have the right kind\nof people that can do this?\n\n177\n00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.950\nAre we going to develop it in house?\n\n178\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.310\nDo we have developers?\n\n179\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.230\nAre we buying it off the shelf?\n\n180\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.800\nAre we contracting a supplier?\n\n181\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.640\nAll of these things could play\nin to the strategic decisions so\n\n182\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.770\nservice strategy must be talking\ndownstream to get that appropriate data.\n\n183\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.430\nHow does transition interact\nwith service operations?\n\n184\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.200\nAgain, because service transition is going\nto be bringing something to life that\n\n185\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.850\noperations needs to then operate\nongoing in steady state or\n\n186\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.580\nin the production environment.\n\n187\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.558\nIt would be pretty silly for operating\nsystems to simply be surprised someday.\n\n188\n00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:25.357\nBy the way, here's a new\nservice have a nice day, right?\n\n189\n00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:28.180\nI mean obviously some of\nthis is rather intuitive,\n\n190\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.080\nthere's gonna be some hand-off between\ntransition and operations, right?\n\n191\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.545\nSo between service design and\ntransition, lots of intricacies.\n\n192\n00:10:36.545 --> 00:10:39.735\nBetween transition and\noperations, lots of intricacies.\n\n193\n00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:43.155\nLots of things, lots of points of contact.\n\n194\n00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:48.485\nAnd, of course, all these talking to\nother stages is expected as well.\n\n195\n00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:50.785\nSo where would operational staff,\nthen, be involved?\n\n196\n00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:55.365\nCertainly they would be looking\nat those acceptance tests.\n\n197\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.570\nWhat makes you so\n\n198\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.550\nwise that their transition to think\nthis is essential to us in operations.\n\n199\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.370\nIf you find a problem\nin service transition,\n\n200\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.680\nare you logging that problem so we can\nstart tracking it in service operations?\n\n201\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.080\nIt's not that every service must be\ndelivered without any flaws, but\n\n202\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.450\nservices should be delivered if they\nhave flaws, transparently delivered.\n\n203\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.690\nSo we know what flaws they are and\n\n204\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.820\nknow how to perhaps have work\narounds built into place.\n\n205\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.440\nAt least have the communication channels\nopen so that we know that these issues\n\n206\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.630\nexist and our customers won't be\nsurprised or found wanting, etc.\n\n207\n00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo be there to participate\nin transition planning.\n\n208\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.650\nBe there in the testing aspects of it.\n\n209\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.310\nCertainly be there to take on the new\nknowledge, learning, and training.\n\n210\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.000\nBe there for that.\n\n211\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.130\nAnd of course, there's operational\nstaff involvement in CSI.\n\n212\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:58.541\nOnce a service becomes operational,\nthere can be lots of opportunities for\n\n213\n00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:03.520\nidentifying problems\nin service transition.\n\n214\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.930\nSo again, an example I used earlier, where\nwe have a service being delivered and\n\n215\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:14.200\nit's broken on delivery and you ask\nthe question, hey didn't you test that?\n\n216\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.320\nAnd the transition folks says,\nyeah, we tested it.\n\n217\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.160\nAnd then you find that\nthe testing environment and\n\n218\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.069\nproduction environment were so out of sync\nthat the test wasn't really appropriate.\n\n219\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.004\nYou didn't test it enough.\n\n220\n00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:31.920\nSo if that happens a lot, the service\noperations is going to say hey we're\n\n221\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.790\nputting fires out everyday because\nthey're not testing effectively.\n\n222\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.550\nThen that becomes an idea for\n\n223\n00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.570\ntransition to be improved,\nthat's bubbling up from operations.\n\n224\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:46.316\nI give that same story about design flaws.\n\n225\n00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:51.093\nOperations could bubble up problems\nthat can be fixed ongoing if you had\n\n226\n00:12:51.093 --> 00:12:54.180\na better service design approach.\n\n227\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.796\nSo operation staff certainly involved in\nfeeding back to transition post de facto.\n\n228\n00:12:59.796 --> 00:13:04.610\nBut also involved with interacting\nwith service transition before we\n\n229\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.352\never get to launch, be there.\n\n230\n00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:11.300\nITIL has a strong predisposition\n\n231\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.510\nto encourage involvement of operational\nstaff early in the life cycle stages.\n\n232\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.420\nAnd that predisposition is borne out\nof the research they've done, right?\n\n233\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.700\nAgain, all of ITIL is based on\nresearch and practice, right?\n\n234\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.390\nThey see it work, they see it not work,\nand they write recommendations to\n\n235\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.490\naddress the shortcomings that they\nhave observed in their research.\n\n236\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.060\nOne of the shortcomings they've\nobserved in their research effort.\n\n237\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.875\nHow many researches do you have today?\n\n238\n00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:43.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Two.\n&gt;&gt; Two, okay, two researches, all right.\n\n239\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.470\nIn their research, they have determined\nthat the absence of operational\n\n240\n00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.430\nstaff at the other stages in the life\ncycle can prove problematic.\n\n241\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.670\nSo they found that more than once.\n\n242\n00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.420\nSo they have a strong predisposition that\noperational staff should be involved\n\n243\n00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.420\nin other stages of the life cycle.\n\n244\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.780\nCertainly into transition, certainly into\ndesign, and certainly even into strategy.\n\n245\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.040\nYou gotta get those feedback loops open,\nright?\n\n246\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.280\nOperation staff,\nas it was observed in the research,\n\n247\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.550\nhave often been left out of that and\ntherefore problems arose because.\n\n248\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.940\nHad they just simply asked\nthe operations folks,\n\n249\n00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.849\nthey would have forestalled\na particular shortcoming.\n\n250\n00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.630\nI mean, how many times in operations\nperhaps have you scratched your head\n\n251\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.880\nsaying, what were they thinking?\n\n252\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.700\nITIL is basically recognizing that\ntheir thoughts need to be influenced by\n\n253\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.392\npeople on the ground.\n\n254\n00:14:35.392 --> 00:14:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n255\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:44.173\n&gt;&gt; So when you consider operating service\ntransition across the life cycle you\n\n256\n00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:47.821\ncertainly considering its keen\ninteraction with service design.\n\n257\n00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:50.809\nAnd that they're gonna be there to\ninfluence the development of that\n\n258\n00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:52.270\nService Design Package.\n\n259\n00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.920\nThe editing, the renewal of that Service\nDesign Package as it continues to live.\n\n260\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.740\nThey're going to be there to access the\nservice acceptance criteria and to provide\n\n261\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:07.060\nfeedback on what is possible, the art of\npossible in service transition, right?\n\n262\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.550\nOf course service transition is gonna\nbe also interacting quite a bit\n\n263\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:15.370\nwith service operations and managing all\nthose tentacles of interaction as well.\n\n264\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.890\nSo service transition needs to be backed\nby good policy that says, we are gonna do\n\n265\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:25.170\nit this way and have suitable controls\nin place, suitable governance in place.\n\n266\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.430\nMaking sure that you have the ability\nto determine your faults,\n\n267\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.560\nknow your weaknesses, and therefore\nimprove those weaknesses as you can.\n\n268\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.648\nInvolve customers, key aspect here,\n\n269\n00:15:35.648 --> 00:15:39.820\nstakeholder management is important\nthroughout the life cycle stage.\n\n270\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.160\nInvolving customers throughout this\ntransition stage is also there.\n\n271\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.770\nThey should be there signing off on\nthe service acceptance criteria.\n\n272\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.820\nWhen it's created in service design,\nthey should be there signing off\n\n273\n00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.540\nthat that criteria has been\nmet in service transition.\n\n274\n00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.440\nThe customer should be involved there.\n\n275\n00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.040\nThat's not an easy grab,\nI mean the customers,\n\n276\n00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.990\nI've certainly worked with customers\nto say IT don't bug me with this.\n\n277\n00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:09.180\nI got to go find more oil, I gotta go to\ncourt, whatever the business might be.\n\n278\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.240\nI got other things to do than\ncome to an IT meeting and\n\n279\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.380\ntalk about service acceptance criteria.\n\n280\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.400\nJust do it and do it good,\ndon't ask me any more questions.\n\n281\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.650\nThat's unacceptable, honestly.\n\n282\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.120\nAnd what I mean by unacceptable\nis it's unworkable.\n\n283\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.490\nIf you can't get the customer to\nagree to what success looks like,\n\n284\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.640\nyou're putting yourself at risk\nof delivering the wrong things.\n\n285\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.161\nBut more importantly,\nyou are putting the customer at risk for\n\n286\n00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.627\ndelivering the wrong things and\nthey need to recognize that.\n\n287\n00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:44.490\nSo, as you take the exam, you need to\nbe looking for that particular failing.\n\n288\n00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.930\nThe customer is not involved,\nthe customer doesn't want to come.\n\n289\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.560\nIt's not acceptable to ITIL that\nthe customer can take a pass.\n\n290\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.390\nYou've got to get them involved.\n\n291\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.020\nJust straight up.\n\n292\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Customer, value, service.\n\n293\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.785\n&gt;&gt; That's right, customer, value, service.\n\n294\n00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:02.629\nSo self study is very important you're\ngoing to get a chance to take some sample\n\n295\n00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:05.270\npapers, there's a couple\nof those available.\n\n296\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.560\nThere's also for a lot of the subject\nmatter some good little exercises.\n\n297\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.070\nSome directed self study if you will.\n\n298\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.682\nFor the topics related to Release and\n\n299\n00:17:12.682 --> 00:17:16.540\nDeployment Management service transition\nhere there's a good little exercise.\n\n300\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.526\nIt's available in the episode\nfiles which is find that link, and\n\n301\n00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:23.362\ninside that you'll find\nthis good exercise.\n\n302\n00:17:23.362 --> 00:17:25.891\nPace yourself through that\nlearning opportunity,\n\n303\n00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:27.910\nthat reinforcement opportunity.\n\n304\n00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.910\nIf you got any questions\nat all about these things,\n\n305\n00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.310\njoin the forum, ask some questions there.\n\n306\n00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.010\nExperts will be there to\nanswer your questions or\n\n307\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.930\nother peers will be there to\nhave discussion with you.\n\n308\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.000\nSo remember the forum's there for\ndiscussion, the exercises are there for\n\n309\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.480\nreinforcement and enjoy your studies.\n\n310\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.985\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as always,

00:00:12.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.390\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.700\njoining us at ITPRO.TV where we\nhelp you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.640\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with ITIL MALC,\n\n7\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.140\nthis happens to be service operation and\nCSI across the lifecycle.\n\n8\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.180\nAnd Terry Decker, once again, is gonna\ngive us all that great information,\n\n9\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.395\nbecause he's amazing.\n\n10\n00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:35.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm happy to be here,\nhappy to be amazing.\n\n11\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.740\nAnd as Zach said, we're gonna explore,\n\n12\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.460\nagain, how these stages\noperate amongst each other.\n\n13\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.320\nAnd we've gone through service design,\nservice transition, and\n\n14\n00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.370\nnow we are moving towards\nservice operation and CSI.\n\n15\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.416\nSo, as we look at the graphic here,\nit is pretty indicative\n\n16\n00:00:54.416 --> 00:01:01.040\nof a lot of churn here between operation\nand CSI, and that is absolutely true.\n\n17\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.360\nThat has been my experience is that\nwhen you are actually delivering\n\n18\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.300\nthe service where you see plenty\nof opportunities to improve.\n\n19\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.450\nRight.\n\n20\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.680\nIt's certainly visible to\nthe customer at this point.\n\n21\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.220\nYou're delivering the service and\noperation, so\n\n22\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.810\nthe customer's going to be\nperhaps knocking on your door.\n\n23\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.050\nThey're using the service,\n\n24\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.310\nthey might be complaining, they might\nbe hitting the service desk every day.\n\n25\n00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.030\nWith not complaints, but with an incident.\n\n26\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.860\nI can't find the submit button.\n\n27\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.350\nThe printer's not working.\n\n28\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.750\nHow come my headsets didn't arrive?\n\n29\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.720\nI mean,\nthere could be some complaints involved.\n\n30\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.350\nBut also could be, I don't know how to\ndo this, I don't know how to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.230\nThere could be some help issues involved\nin these calls to the service desk.\n\n32\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.590\nSo, when your in operation, they're\ngoing to have an opportunity to start.\n\n33\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.590\nKeeping your finger on the pulse\nof customer satisfaction as well.\n\n34\n00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.670\nSo, there are certainly a lot of churn for\nCSI that comes out of service operations.\n\n35\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.770\nThat's a very appropriate\nlittle graphic here.\n\n36\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.110\nLots of things happening in\nbetween service operation and CSI.\n\n37\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.500\n&gt;&gt; It's a good graphic too,\nit makes sense.\n\n38\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, and we saw this earlier,\nit shows up at all the courses.\n\n39\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.240\nAnd we saw this earlier even in this\ncourse, where it's got the downhill\n\n40\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.880\nflow from service strategy to design,\nor transition to operations.\n\n41\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.260\nAnd then CSI, as if it's at the bottom,\nwaiting for something to do.\n\n42\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080\nNow, I don't want you to get that idea.\n\n43\n00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.040\nRemember, CSI is alive and\nwell everywhere.\n\n44\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.420\nBut certainly it's possible that\nservice operations could churn up\n\n45\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.590\nsome issues that actually\ncould be improved upstream.\n\n46\n00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.590\nNow, while we might need to\nimprove service operation itself.\n\n47\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.190\nRight.\nAnd\n\n48\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.680\nthat's where the improvement idea lies,\n\n49\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.570\nit could be that the improvement\nidea actually is upstream.\n\n50\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.260\nI know in my own experience we regularly\nfound, we were bringing on services that\n\n51\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.530\nalready existed, but fires were burning\non them, I mean, there was something,\n\n52\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.830\nthere were architectural problems,\nthere was outage issues,\n\n53\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.980\nthere weren't request models, or incident\nmodels in place, that sort of thing.\n\n54\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.773\nAnd when we took these on we found\na recurring theme that, you know what?,\n\n55\n00:03:00.773 --> 00:03:03.906\nthey could have asked this\nquestion up in service design, and\n\n56\n00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:06.890\nwe wouldn't be facing this question now,\nright?\n\n57\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.500\nSo, we understood kind of the whole\nlifecycle approach to service management.\n\n58\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.730\nWe hadn't been practicing that in\nthis organization very long at all,\n\n59\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.660\nin fac,t in some cases.\n\n60\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.370\nSo, if we discern that the problems are\nactually existing upstream, then by golly,\n\n61\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.230\nlet's go change things upstream.\n\n62\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.290\nSo, while there is a lot of churn here,\n\n63\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.700\nI recognize the churn here\nbetween operations and CSI.\n\n64\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.850\nRemember, CSI is alive and\nwell throughout the life cycle stages.\n\n65\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.720\nAnd operations is just showing\nthe symptoms of those issues.\n\n66\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.460\nSo, that's the theme of the rest\nof this particular episode,\n\n67\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.710\nis that CSI is there to improve things,\nabsolutely.\n\n68\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.925\nAnd, because operations is where\nthe blemishes are often exposed.\n\n69\n00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:56.845\nService operations is key\ncomponent to improving, all right.\n\n70\n00:03:56.845 --> 00:03:58.265\nSo, as we continue to go.\n\n71\n00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:00.195\nYou should have service reviews.\n\n72\n00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:01.375\nThe way to expose and\n\n73\n00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:06.350\nbe very transparent about how you're\ndoing is to review your services.\n\n74\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.020\nNow, remember, service level management,\n\n75\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.370\nway back up in service design,\ndefined what success looks like.\n\n76\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.960\nIncidents will be resolved\nwithin two hours.\n\n77\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.580\nAvailability will be 99.9%.\n\n78\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.110\nChanges will be delivered on time and\nnot cause any problems.\n\n79\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.970\nI mean, all of these things could be\nbuilt into a service level agreement.\n\n80\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.830\nAnd you're also promising within\nthat service-level agreement\n\n81\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.770\nthat you're going to review things.\n\n82\n00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.820\nSo, what you're actually reviewing is\nthe operational effectiveness, right?\n\n83\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.480\nOf service operations.\n\n84\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.160\nSo, have these reviews.\n\n85\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.230\nLook at how well you're doing, or\nconversely, how well you're not doing.\n\n86\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.480\nAnd if you're not doing well, highlight\nyour commitment to improving, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.530\nObviously playing through there.\n\n88\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.140\nSo, there's that connection to SLM, right?\n\n89\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.250\nBecoming a true service provider means,\nyou're gonna keep score, right?\n\n90\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.580\nIf you want to improve your performance,\nthe first\n\n91\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.960\nstep is to measure your performance,\nagree to what success looks like, right?\n\n92\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.350\nSo, if the client says, or the customer\nsays, it's slow, define what slow is.\n\n93\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.090\nIf they say, it's always down,\ndefine availability, right?\n\n94\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.110\nIf they say, the service desk is slow,\ndefine slow, right?\n\n95\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.000\nCome up with measurable targets.\n\n96\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.850\nCommit to those targets and\n\n97\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.380\ntransparently reveal your\nperformance versus those targets.\n\n98\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.020\nSLM provides the basis for that, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.770\nSo, SLM has a play in service operations,\nright.\n\n100\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.850\nCustomer satisfaction.\n\n101\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.210\nNow, BRM is there to handle complaints,\nand to deal with unsatisfied customers.\n\n102\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.960\nThat's what the process called business\nrelationship management is about.\n\n103\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.540\nAnd what your trying to do is to\nensure they use the word secure here.\n\n104\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.520\nHow can we secure customer satisfaction\n\n105\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.390\nthrough our service offerings is\nreally what you're trying to get done.\n\n106\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.360\nYou do this by designing the right\nservices through an appropriate strategy.\n\n107\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.630\nYou design them to satisfy that strategy.\n\n108\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.560\nYou make sure that the service-accepted\ncriteria is fully vetted, and\n\n109\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.360\nthen validated in service transition.\n\n110\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.200\nAnd of course, continual service\nimprovement is going to be there\n\n111\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.350\nto highlight when you have a shortfall,\nwhen you are not meeting that commitment.\n\n112\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.400\nI want to challenge you to\nsomething else to consider as well.\n\n113\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.620\nIntegration with the business means,\n\n114\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.360\ncertainly you are going to understand\nwhat they're trying to get done.\n\n115\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.590\nMeasuring your performance is going to\nhelp give you indications of whether,\n\n116\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.480\nor not you're satisfying the customer.\n\n117\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.090\nBut, being very explicit, and\nspecific about customer satisfaction.\n\n118\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.140\nAnd by explicit and specific,\nI mean, you know, ask them often.\n\n119\n00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.630\nDon't just take the anecdotal complaints,\nright?\n\n120\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.960\nFormalize your feedback\nmechanisms with the customer, so\n\n121\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.040\nyou know if you're on the right track,\nor not, formalize that.\n\n122\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.680\nThat's what I mean by explicit, and\n\n123\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.320\nby specific, I mean,\nfocus on their business outcomes.\n\n124\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.210\nBe very specific to that, now, that's not\nan easy grab, but it's a worthy grab.\n\n125\n00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.260\nIf you have promised that your\nIT service will help the lawyer\n\n126\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.190\nget cases filed more timely and\nmore accurately.\n\n127\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.010\nThen measured speed and\nmeasure accuracy of court filings, right.\n\n128\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.870\nIf you promise your service is\ngoing to help the oil company\n\n129\n00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.460\nfind the oil more quickly,\nmeasure the speed.\n\n130\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.730\nTo find oil.\n\n131\n00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.943\nNow, you're giving here the business\nis business there and they say, no!\n\n132\n00:07:31.943 --> 00:07:34.850\nStay away IT I get that, right?\n\n133\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.180\nYou can measure the availability\nof your services, and\n\n134\n00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.330\nbe a proxy measurement to their business\noutcomes that maybe the best you can do.\n\n135\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.270\nBut how valuable would it be?\n\n136\n00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.220\nHow strategic would it be for\n\n137\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.590\nyou to integrate with the business so\nmuch that they can see direct pay off.\n\n138\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.840\nOf your services to\ntheir business outcomes.\n\n139\n00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.960\nYou're not going to get\nthat without measurement.\n\n140\n00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.150\nSo, this idea of measuring your\nown performance is important.\n\n141\n00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.240\nI'm not degrading that in any way.\n\n142\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.210\nIt's right up there as a gold standard.\n\n143\n00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.090\nMeasure your performance.\n\n144\n00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.990\nBut measure how your performance affects\ntheir business outcomes is a next step of\n\n145\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.360\nintegration with the business that can't\nbe overstated how important that is, okay.\n\n146\n00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.600\nAnd look for\nthat opportunities back at work.\n\n147\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.910\nLook for those opportunities to\nsqueeze that value proposition\n\n148\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.570\non the MALC exam as well.\n\n149\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.620\nGet as much value as you can, so\nthe difference between a five answer, and\n\n150\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.160\na three answer regarding improvements\n\n151\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.520\nmight be the difference between\njust focusing on IT performance.\n\n152\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.300\nAnd focusing on business outcomes.\n\n153\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.670\nThe five answer that looks for\n\n154\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.690\nthat business value proposition\nis probably gonna be there, okay.\n\n155\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.620\nNow, so you're gonna measure,\nyou're gonna grab.\n\n156\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.680\nThe SLM is gonna do a lot of measurement,\ngonna get all the stuff,\n\n157\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.680\nthe collating part is putting it\ninto a digestible report, right.\n\n158\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.540\nCollate that information maybe\nthey're dissatisfied with service desk\n\n159\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.040\nperformance.\n\n160\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.080\nMaybe they're dissatisfied\nwith availability.\n\n161\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.890\nMaybe they hate the functionality.\n\n162\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.090\nIt's clunky, it doesn't work,\nit's not intuitive.\n\n163\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.690\nI can never find the submit button,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n164\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.300\nthey might be up there complaining\nabout lot's of things.\n\n165\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.260\nCollate those things and\nunderstand where you need to go.\n\n166\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.310\nI like these little equation here,\n\n167\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.950\nSatisfaction = Perception- Expectation,\nright?\n\n168\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.970\nExpectation management is\nvery important here, right?\n\n169\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.220\nWhat is slow for a login?\n\n170\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.570\nAsk one person, they may ten seconds.\n\n171\n00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.790\nAsk another, they'll say, if it takes\nmore than five seconds, I'm giving up.\n\n172\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:42.000\nAsk another person, and they are quite\nfine waiting 15 seconds, right?\n\n173\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.210\nWhat is slow?\n\n174\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.360\nSo, if their expectation\nis that speed means logins\n\n175\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.640\nare less than five seconds, you might\nneed to change your expectations.\n\n176\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.360\nRight?\n\n177\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.720\nSo, that their satisfaction level goes up,\nbecause their perceptions have been reset.\n\n178\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's an old saying that says,\nthat you'll be happier,\n\n179\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.135\nif you accept rather than expect.\n\n180\n00:10:06.135 --> 00:10:07.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n181\n00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.750\nAccept rather than expect.\n\n182\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.420\nYeah, that's pretty good, yeah.\n\n183\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.220\nI remember taking a leadership course\nthat talked about this idea of happiness\n\n184\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.220\nas a choice.\n\n185\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.760\nA pastor at my church years ago told us\na little story that when he was a little\n\n186\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.710\nboy, he was scraping some paint off\nthe eave of a house in the summertime in\n\n187\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.120\nFlorida, grew up down in Florida, and\njust sweaty, and it's in his face,\n\n188\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.310\nit's sticking on his skin.\n\n189\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.560\nAnd he's a 12-year-old boy that much be\nrather playing baseball down the street,\n\n190\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.055\nand he's just mad going through this.\n\n191\n00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:36.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n192\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:42.500\nhis father said, you have a choice,\nyou're going to be doing this today.\n\n193\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.310\nYou can either choose to be mad,\nor you can choose to be happy.\n\n194\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.940\nRight.\nSo,\n\n195\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.802\njust a little philosophical\nquestion there.\n\n196\n00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:49.757\n&gt;&gt; Accept, not expected.\n\n197\n00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:51.190\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, very good.\n\n198\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.700\nSo, in this expectation management,\nyou need to allow your\n\n199\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.310\ncustomers to understand appropriately\nwhat they can't expect, so\n\n200\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.210\nthat they can accept-\n&gt;&gt; There it is, yeah.\n\n201\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.550\n&gt;&gt; More appropriately\nwhat you're providing.\n\n202\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.820\nNow, that doesn't mean you lie, or you\ncheat, or you say, don't worry about it.\n\n203\n00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.960\n15 seconds is fast enough.\n\n204\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.860\nGo away.\n\n205\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.510\nI'm not saying that you\ndiscount it in any way.\n\n206\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.640\nBe aware that their expectations are going\nto affect their perceptions, and\n\n207\n00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.100\nyou need to manage both, right.\n\n208\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.460\nYou need to manage those things.\n\n209\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.800\nAnd then, you have a better chance of\nmanagement of satisfaction, right?\n\n210\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.405\nAll right, so we've churned up a bunch of\nideas potentially from service operations.\n\n211\n00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:32.335\nCSI looks at those opportunities and\n\n212\n00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:36.290\nmakes the appropriate judgment as\nwhere we need to go to improve.\n\n213\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.150\nMaybe it is just simply\nimproving operations.\n\n214\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.980\nMaybe it's improving\nsomething more holistically,\n\n215\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.160\nlike up at service design, or\nat service trans, even service strategy.\n\n216\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.810\nWherever the dog may sniff out\nthe opportunity, follow that dog there,\n\n217\n00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.380\nand enjoy the prey.\n\n218\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.625\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully not my dog,\nbecause my dog doesn't smell very well.\n\n219\n00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n220\n00:11:57.825 --> 00:11:59.772\nAll right.\nThe last shows us how CSI, and\n\n221\n00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:03.349\noperations kind of interact to\nimprove things across the life cycle,\n\n222\n00:12:03.349 --> 00:12:05.260\nnot just between themselves.\n\n223\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.220\nHow about some homework?\n\n224\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.650\nI know, you love homework.\n\n225\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.870\nSo, there's options available,\n\n226\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.920\nmany options available to\nreinforce these many topics here.\n\n227\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.720\nThere's one called customer satisfaction.\n\n228\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.340\nYou see that highlighted here.\n\n229\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.440\nThere's yet another one called\nService Desk Survey Techniques.\n\n230\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.330\nAnother exercise there.\n\n231\n00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.100\nAnd yet another one called,\nstrategic assessment.\n\n232\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.160\nAll three of these knowledge checks, or\n\n233\n00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.450\nself study opportunities\nare available in episode files.\n\n234\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.210\nSo, finally, link the episode files,\ndownload these and enjoy them.\n\n235\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.000\nIf you have any questions about them.\n\n236\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.570\nOr any other subject matter, come to the\nforum and interact there with the experts,\n\n237\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.450\nor the peers taking this learning and\nenjoy it.\n\n238\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.100\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job as usual\nTerry ITIL MALC service operation and\n\n239\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.500\nCSI across the life cycle, and there is so\nmuch more content in the ITIL MALC series.\n\n240\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.950\nMake sure you watch every single video.\n\n241\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.429\nYou will be glad you did.\n\n242\n00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:01.060\nAnd thank

00:00:12.440\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.530\nchoosing ITPro.TV helping\nyou learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.680\nI'm Zach Memos, your host,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n7\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.340\nAnd this is Managing Success Across a Life\nCycle with, you know him, you love him,\n\n8\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.800\nyou can't live without him,\nTerry Decker right here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.970\nTerry, good to see you again.\n\n10\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.290\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here Zack.\n\n11\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.460\nAnd yes, we're gonna dive into\nsome critical success factors and\n\n12\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.800\nchallenges associated with\nmanaging across a life cycle.\n\n13\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.270\nThe discussion of the challenges\nrelated to service management\n\n14\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.140\nfocus on the customer,\nas you would expect from ITIL.\n\n15\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.654\nIt also focuses on\nresistance to change and\n\n16\n00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:56.815\nwhen you talk about a culture\nof continuous improvement,\n\n17\n00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:01.220\nyou' re also talking about\na culture of continuous change.\n\n18\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.710\nAnd change is not necessarily\nembraced by everyone equally.\n\n19\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.660\nSome people like it,\nsome people will hate it.\n\n20\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.760\nSome people resist it, some people\ndon't like it, but get along with it.\n\n21\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.280\nSome people just can't wait for\nthe next newest flavor.\n\n22\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.240\nSo that is the dynamic generally in play\nas we discuss these various challenges and\n\n23\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.880\ncritical success factors\nof service strategy.\n\n24\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.280\nSo let's have a look.\n\n25\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.760\nLooking here at service strategy and\n\n26\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.830\nsome of the challenges,\nI mentioned the complexity.\n\n27\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.380\nOrganizational complexity, these\nvarying degrees of attitudes and goals.\n\n28\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.990\nYou might have folks that are just\ntrying to keep the lights on and\n\n29\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.290\nkeep things stable.\n\n30\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.770\nThey've been working their several years.\n\n31\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.970\nThey don't want anything new.\n\n32\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.120\nI like the old system, don't give me\nthe new system, that sort of thing.\n\n33\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.460\nAnd again the type of folks that says we\nneed something new, something better.\n\n34\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.360\nLet's make it snappier, easier to use etc.\n\n35\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.820\nSo that means from a strategic level,\nyou have some complexity in coordinating\n\n36\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.610\ntoward these common goals,\nor common outcomes.\n\n37\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.640\nGetting a common understanding\nof where you're going and\n\n38\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.750\nhow you're going to get\nthere is somewhat difficult.\n\n39\n00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.890\nAgain, not really providing any\nexpert guidance here, just giving you\n\n40\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.160\nthe context of the challenges\nassociated with server strategy.\n\n41\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.340\nIf you consider some other ones,\nI wanna hone in on this one a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.400\nSo if you go for screen, I wanna specially\nlook at the first column here and\n\n43\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.645\nreally focus on this things.\n\n44\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.835\nBegin on the outside not the inside\nof the service organization.\n\n45\n00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:32.035\nBegin on the outside, meaning don't\nfocus on IT, focus on the customer.\n\n46\n00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:36.725\nI've reinforced this in various ways\nthroughout the various episodes.\n\n47\n00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:39.265\nIt even includes\nthe challenge of measurement.\n\n48\n00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.595\nIf you want to measure your performance,\nsure, measure IT performance,\n\n49\n00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:45.695\nthat's important to the customers.\n\n50\n00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:49.450\nIt should be, but\nwhat is the business doing?\n\n51\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.500\nHow are they performing?\n\n52\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.600\nIf they are trying to\nfind something faster, or\n\n53\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.690\ndo something with more accuracy,\nthen measure speed, measure accuracy.\n\n54\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.560\nBe part of the business metrics\ndiscussion, and make sure your\n\n55\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.570\nIT services are aligned with those\nspecific outcomes that are measurable.\n\n56\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.740\nAnother aspect of measurements\nis that you need to be\n\n57\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.120\nresponsive to the customer's\nchanging needs.\n\n58\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.670\nAnd focusing on what the customer's\ntrying to do is gonna beat\n\n59\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.030\nall your other measurements.\n\n60\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.560\nLet me put it this way, is it possible for\nyou to go to a service meeting and have\n\n61\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.970\nall pretty shiny green metrics they're all\nreally good and have an upset customer?\n\n62\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.140\nAll your measurements are good,\nbut the customer is unhappy.\n\n63\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.820\nIs that possible?\n\n64\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n65\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.340\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so that either means you need\nto set a different framework for\n\n66\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.400\nyour measurements have a more\nbalanced approach to your scorecard.\n\n67\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.320\nFor instance, or\nyou certainly need to recognize, and\n\n68\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.840\nkeep your finger on\nthe pulse of the customer.\n\n69\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.160\nYou're not paying attention.\n\n70\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.150\nIf you're all green, and\nhave a dissatisfied customer, and\n\n71\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.780\nyou're unaware of that, then you're\nobviously, you're found lacking.\n\n72\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.260\nSo, focus on the customer.\n\n73\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.760\nThat's also part of\nthe outside in approach.\n\n74\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.670\nWhat do they need?\n\n75\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.327\nWhat are they trying to get done?\n\n76\n00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:04.590\nI like this next one too.\n\n77\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.510\nThink of process and service as equals.\n\n78\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.490\nNow I know this is a tough nut for\nsome people to crack.\n\n79\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.770\nI know some folks that find\nprocess to just mean bureaucracy.\n\n80\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.390\nWe've always done it this way before,\n\n81\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.150\nwe never needed a process before,\nwhy do we have to follow a process now?\n\n82\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.250\nIf you get that kind of feedback.\n\n83\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.500\nOr, the process is too cumbersome.\n\n84\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.700\nI have to get to many\napprovals along the way.\n\n85\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.160\nNow, I'm not saying you\nignore that feedback.\n\n86\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.990\nYou'd listen to that feedback and,\nperhaps,\n\n87\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.710\nyou do need to tweak your processes some.\n\n88\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.070\nMaybe there are too many steps for some\ntypes of activities, and other activities\n\n89\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.940\ncould be more streamlined with, automatic\napprovals or something like that.\n\n90\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.570\nSo when you are considering processes\non equal footing with services,\n\n91\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.310\nyou pay attention to them.\n\n92\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.680\nIt's not that you throw them out and\nignore them.\n\n93\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.310\nIs that you tailor them\nto particular needs.\n\n94\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.940\nNow, ITIL talks about in\n\n95\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.450\nrather casual terms sometimes\nabout just follow the process.\n\n96\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.630\nAnd if you are casual about it,\n\n97\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.900\nthen you'll have a casual\napproach to your success as well.\n\n98\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.370\nFormalizing our steps,\nformalizing your activities allows for\n\n99\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.280\nmeasurement, it allows for consistency\nacross different organizational, elements.\n\n100\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.950\nIt also allows for\na regime of methodical improvement\n\n101\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.600\ninstead of just trying to throw something\non the wall and see if it sticks.\n\n102\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.375\nConsidering process as an important\n\n103\n00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:34.795\nvaluable asset instead of a bureaucratic\nasset would be a big help.\n\n104\n00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:37.845\nNow, academically speaking,\nI've been talking about operations, there.\n\n105\n00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:38.965\nAcademically speaking,\n\n106\n00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:43.415\nabsolutely ITIL's going to have\na predisposition that processes are good.\n\n107\n00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:46.298\nSo as you're looking at\nyour exam questions and\n\n108\n00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:50.841\ntrying to figure out how to best apply\nthe right answer the given scenario,\n\n109\n00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:55.384\nbased on this case study, you're going\nto be looking at opportunities for\n\n110\n00:05:55.384 --> 00:05:58.651\nprocesses, to fill the gaps\nwhere value is missing.\n\n111\n00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:03.257\nThis is the regular theme that plays out\nthrough this [INAUDIBLE] across the life\n\n112\n00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:04.060\ncycle exam.\n\n113\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.920\nThings are going wrong,\n\n114\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.300\nthe way you can try to forestall these\nthings is get stakeholders involved.\n\n115\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.370\nGet their feedback, measure and\n\n116\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.560\nperhaps introduce new\nprocesses is they are missing.\n\n117\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.670\nAll right, numbers matter,\nmaking measurements.\n\n118\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.290\nThis is all about\nthe measurements framework here.\n\n119\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.020\nNumbers matter, and numbers can be\nvolume numbers, how many in a certain\n\n120\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.300\namount of time, what percentage of this\nwas good, what percentage was bad.\n\n121\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.710\nWorking through the measurements,\ncoming up with actual numbers and\n\n122\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.080\nputting a time box around them as well.\n\n123\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.200\nYou know, 60% of our tickets from\nJanuary were resolved within two hours.\n\n124\n00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.030\nIn February, 80% of them were.\n\n125\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.230\nYou got these time elements involved here.\n\n126\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.270\nSo what's so\ndifferent about February than January?\n\n127\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.790\nWas there something that\nwas assignable to January?\n\n128\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.030\nYeah, that's when the data\ncenter melted down.\n\n129\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.190\nThe data center melted down in January and\nwe were going crazy at the service desk.\n\n130\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.450\nSo yeah,\nwe definitely got behind in January.\n\n131\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.420\nBut you have an assignable cost for that.\n\n132\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.860\nSo having time scales\nassociated with your actual\n\n133\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.500\nnumbers is also a valuable asset\nwhen you consider measurement.\n\n134\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.690\nAnd then finally the last one here,\ncompete as an organization.\n\n135\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.690\nYou have competition with\npotential outside organizations.\n\n136\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.480\nCompete within your organization.\n\n137\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.640\nA good, friendly competition.\n\n138\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.680\nSetting these measurements\nin play against each other.\n\n139\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.130\nSay, but the server team gets 80%\nof their tickets resolved on time.\n\n140\n00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.170\nThe database team only gets 60% of theirs.\n\n141\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.690\nJust by expressing the performance you're\nkinda building in the competition because\n\n142\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.810\nit becomes transparent,\nit becomes visible.\n\n143\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.550\nAnd it doesn't need to be a blame culture,\n\n144\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.830\nit just needs to be\na motivational culture.\n\n145\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.610\nNot assigning blame,\njust assigning accountability and\n\n146\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.560\nmoving toward improvement\nwith the actual numbers.\n\n147\n00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.764\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, they did a study once.\n\n148\n00:07:51.764 --> 00:07:55.454\nThey were sending fish across the United\nStates and they would get to the other\n\n149\n00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:58.944\nside of the States, like from the west\nto the east, and they'd be dead.\n\n150\n00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:01.415\nThey just they couldn't keep them\nalive until they put catfish in there.\n\n151\n00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:05.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The catfish kind of kept them alive.\n\n152\n00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.463\nIt was that motivation.\n\n153\n00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:07.410\n&gt;&gt; I got you.\n\n154\n00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.126\n&gt;&gt; Motivation.\n&gt;&gt; They were sort of just swimming around.\n\n155\n00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:11.004\n&gt;&gt; They were motivated to stay alive.\n\n156\n00:08:11.004 --> 00:08:11.620\n&gt;&gt; Motivation to stay alive.\n\n157\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n158\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.160\nThat's pretty interesting.\n\n159\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.170\nStaying active.\n\n160\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.810\nInteresting approach.\n\n161\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.340\nAll right.\n\n162\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.420\nFurther looking at the risk.\n\n163\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.640\nNow this we're looking\nat service strategy.\n\n164\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.790\nThe risk would be failing on\nthese opportunities to measure,\n\n165\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.006\nnot having sufficient measurement in\nplace, or making the wrong guesses, right?\n\n166\n00:08:29.006 --> 00:08:31.630\nSo to speak, you shouldn't be guessing but\n\n167\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.190\nyou're gonna make some\ncalculated risks along the way.\n\n168\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.870\nWhat if you kind of miss\non that risk assessment and\n\n169\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.290\nyou deliver a service that's not\nreally satisfying to the customers or\n\n170\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.130\nyou over build or over spend on stuff\nthat the customer didn't really need?\n\n171\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.780\nI've certainly seen that happen too where\nwe responded to the flashy object as an IT\n\n172\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.880\norganization, the nice shiny object in the\ndistance because it really looked good.\n\n173\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.130\nIt was in our wheelhouse,\nwe really are good at this.\n\n174\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.500\nSo give me one of those again and I'll do\nit again for you, customer, kind of thing.\n\n175\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.030\nGive you an example of this challenge of\nstrategy ongoing through an organization.\n\n176\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.880\nI'll use a little quaint\nmilitary example for this one.\n\n177\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.825\nIf the strategy is to keep the enemy from\nmoving north, one of the tactics might be\n\n178\n00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:19.260\nlet's take out the bridges 40 kilometers\nfrom here, from here, 40 kilometers out,\n\n179\n00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.330\nlet's wipe out all the bridges, so\nthat they can't easily move north.\n\n180\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.750\nNow, if later you learn that the enemy\nhas actually moved 100 clicks away,\n\n181\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.640\nor 200 kilometers away,\n\n182\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.849\nthen taking out bridges 40 miles from\nhere is no longer a viable tactic.\n\n183\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.240\nIf you understand the strategy,\nkeep the enemy from moving north.\n\n184\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.380\nAnd you can reorient yourself\nto that strategy all the time.\n\n185\n00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.430\nThen you won't waste so many tactics,\nlike taking out out a bunch of bridges.\n\n186\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.320\nWaste the resources on bridges.\n\n187\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.610\nIn an IT sense, I've seen that happen,\ncertainly play out.\n\n188\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.550\nI've seen IT departments figuratively say\n\n189\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.190\ncan you give us another\nbridge to take out?\n\n190\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.080\nWe have the skill set for that,\nwe are really good at that.\n\n191\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.780\nWe got in a bonus last year for\ntaking out bridges.\n\n192\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.040\nCan we take out some more bridges please?\n\n193\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.650\nGive me a bridge.\n\n194\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.676\nI wanna take out a bridge.\n\n195\n00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:06.444\nBecause you're good at it.\n\n196\n00:10:06.444 --> 00:10:07.076\nRight?\n\n197\n00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:11.717\nService strategy needs to be\nvery careful about articulating\n\n198\n00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:16.190\nthe goals of the strategy as\nopposed to the tactical goals.\n\n199\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.920\nYou have to measure the tactical goals too\nand you have to get that feedback from\n\n200\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.100\non the ground that the bridge\nhas actually been removed and\n\n201\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.020\nthe enemy's not moving north, etc.\n\n202\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.730\nBut you can't lose track of the goal.\n\n203\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.690\nIf you get involved in measurement,\nhow many bridges have you taken out\n\n204\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.850\nthis month, you'll be looking for\nbridges, right?\n\n205\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.717\nThat's just the way it goes, so\nyour measurements and your tactics for\n\n206\n00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:40.830\nmeasurements will generates\nthe behavior changes potentially.\n\n207\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.860\nBut are those behaviour changes\nconsistently matching the strategy?\n\n208\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.680\nA very big challenge and\nthat happens when you're designing things,\n\n209\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.870\ndid you overbuild?\n\n210\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.450\nDid you build only for bridges and\ndidn't consider airports?\n\n211\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.460\nDid you only take out\nbridges in your operations?\n\n212\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.351\nDid you only go 40 clicks away?\n\n213\n00:10:59.351 --> 00:10:59.973\nEtc.\nAnd\n\n214\n00:10:59.973 --> 00:11:01.910\nthen of course there's the market risk.\n\n215\n00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.750\nWhat are your competitors doing?\n\n216\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.990\nAre you spending too much money?\n\n217\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.980\nAre you costing too much money?\n\n218\n00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.263\nDoes your organization consider\noutsourcing you, because you're so\n\n219\n00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:13.870\nexpensive?\n\n220\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.860\nAre you in competitive mode with\nan external, you're an external provider,\n\n221\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.190\nyou have an external competitor.\n\n222\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.650\nAre they gaining market share and\nyou're losing market share?\n\n223\n00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.910\nAre you too expensive?\n\n224\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.590\nAre you not niched enough?\n\n225\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.200\nDo you not have the right\nkind of mix of services?\n\n226\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.660\nThose are all challenges that\nservice strategy has to take on,\n\n227\n00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.020\nand risks that they face, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.200\nSo what makes service strategy successful?\n\n229\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.670\nWhat are the critical\nfactors of service strategy?\n\n230\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.410\nHaving good trained staff that\nunderstand strategic directions.\n\n231\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.540\nWise people making wise decisions.\n\n232\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.290\nHaving good data in front of them.\n\n233\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.770\nAdequate support from the business.\n\n234\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.450\nYou're not that mysterious cost center.\n\n235\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.310\nWhere they say we're not sure what\nyou cost, I'm more not sure you do.\n\n236\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.300\nBut you sure cost a lot.\n\n237\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.920\nRight.\nYou want to get away from that and\n\n238\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.760\nbecome that strategic asset.\n\n239\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.810\nSo becoming a strategic asset\nmeans you're good at what you do.\n\n240\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.300\nAnd what you do affects their outcomes.\n\n241\n00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.260\nSo get their backing from the business\nside and get their backing within\n\n242\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.250\nyour organization that you're moving\ntoward the right goals at the right time.\n\n243\n00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.010\nThose are the critical success\nfactors of service strategy.\n\n244\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.491\n&gt;&gt; Awesome\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n245\n00:12:25.491 --> 00:12:27.120\nNow consider some of\nthe challenges of Service Design.\n\n246\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.650\nI'm not going to read you\n20 bullet statements here.\n\n247\n00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.000\nI want to wax poetic,\nif I will, for a minute.\n\n248\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.031\nWe talked about service design-\n\n249\n00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:35.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Throughout.\n\n250\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.590\nWe talked about how service\ndesign is trying to answer\n\n251\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.530\nall the questions that need to be answered\nbefore you start building things.\n\n252\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.130\nBefore you start testing things.\n\n253\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:51.410\nBefore you start assembling, I should say,\nthis thing called a service.\n\n254\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.140\nAnswering all the questions about how it\nshould be built, why it should be built,\n\n255\n00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.700\nat what time, what processes,\nwhat people are involved, right?\n\n256\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.160\nWhat partners,\nmaybe suppliers are involved.\n\n257\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.160\nAnswering all those questions and\ngetting all those documents created so\n\n258\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.300\nthat you can articulate clearly to\nthe transition stage what has to happen.\n\n259\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.740\nThat's what you're trying to get done.\n\n260\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.290\nSo just imagine where the challenges come.\n\n261\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.800\nYou don't have sufficient data.\n\n262\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.890\nYou don't have a good vetting\nof the requirements, right?\n\n263\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.200\nYou're not sure of your own capabilities.\n\n264\n00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.190\nYou're asked to do too\nmany things at once, and\n\n265\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.850\nyou can't even manage your own\nwork flow and service design.\n\n266\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.370\nYou got 25 projects happening this year,\nand they're all starting in March, and\n\n267\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.610\nyou have no idea how you're gonna\nget all that work done, right?\n\n268\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.150\nSo you're not even managing\nthe workflow appropriately.\n\n269\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.050\nThese are the challenges\nin service design.\n\n270\n00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.410\nA lot of things coming to you,\na lot of questions to answer, and\n\n271\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.620\ndoing so in a way that's predictable.\n\n272\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.750\nAnd manageable on a day to day basis and\nrepeating them.\n\n273\n00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.495\nSo among those bullet statements\nis what I've just said.\n\n274\n00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:57.220\nIs that you're trying to find the magic\nelixir that you get good at this.\n\n275\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.128\nDrink the snake oil and\nbe a good service design technician-\n\n276\n00:14:00.128 --> 00:14:01.004\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Snake oil, not the kool-aid.\n\n277\n00:14:01.004 --> 00:14:02.106\n&gt;&gt; That's right?\n\n278\n00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:02.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n279\n00:14:02.619 --> 00:14:05.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so\nwhat could happen then\n\n280\n00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:08.320\nis you could over commit\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n281\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.810\nyou got 25 projects yeah no problem we'll\ntake them on bring them to us, right.\n\n282\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.420\nWe'll take these 25 projects and we'll\ndeliver all these service design packages\n\n283\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.080\nat the end of April and\nwe'll just dump it on service transition.\n\n284\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.790\nObviously you got to be\nconcerned about that team too,\n\n285\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.110\nthose groups of people trying to\nget that kind of work done, right.\n\n286\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.980\nNow ultimately you're gonna have to\ndeliver on the business outcomes.\n\n287\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.320\nSo you're just by having\nthe idea to say yes,\n\n288\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.580\nwe can get it done is not\nnecessarily a great answer.\n\n289\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.810\nYou need to know what you can get done and\nwhen you can get doing so\n\n290\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.330\nyou can manage this\nworkflow appropriately.\n\n291\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.900\nSo, cost and integrity, planning and\n\n292\n00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:49.350\nintegrity, execution and integrity, all\nthose things in play in a balanced way.\n\n293\n00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.685\nSo among those challenges,\n\n294\n00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:54.380\na challenge is simply a risk that\nhas 100% of chance of happening.\n\n295\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.265\nService design is hard, right?\n\n296\n00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:57.810\nYou've got a lot of things to consider.\n\n297\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:02.170\nThe risks are if you don't do service\ndesign well you're gonna have risks of\n\n298\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.820\nfailure, you're gonna deliver\na service that's not fully baked.\n\n299\n00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.040\nCustomers will be dissatisfied, you'll\nlose reputation, you'll become not only\n\n300\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.920\nthe mysterious cost center, you'll become,\nyou cost a lot and you do harm, right?\n\n301\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.274\nThat sort of thing which\nis a bad place to be.\n\n302\n00:15:17.274 --> 00:15:20.790\nSo, making sure you have a good\nrelationship with strategists, so\n\n303\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.439\nyou clearly understand and\ncan vet the requirements that are coming.\n\n304\n00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:27.666\nAnd that you have a good relationship\nwith service transition so\n\n305\n00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:31.074\nyou understand their working environment,\ntheir capabilities,\n\n306\n00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:34.140\ntheir throughput,\ntheir bandwidth, if you will.\n\n307\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.210\nUnderstanding what that part of\nthe organization can do, what the strategy\n\n308\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.120\npart of the organization can do and\nmanaging the bridge between them.\n\n309\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.522\nIs certainly fraught with some risks,\nokay?\n\n310\n00:15:42.522 --> 00:15:45.120\nI would want to encourage\nyou to something else.\n\n311\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.335\nI should have said this from the outset.\n\n312\n00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:50.921\nWhen we consider these challenges and\nrisks for any of these processes or\n\n313\n00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:54.880\nany of these stages, test makers consider\nthese challenges and risks as well.\n\n314\n00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.335\nSo as you go back and review If you\npause on these particular slides and\n\n315\n00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.533\npick up on the nuance between the lines,\n\n316\n00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:09.560\nyou might find the same testable\nobjective that a test maker would find.\n\n317\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.690\nPut that another way, when the test\nmaker's setting out to write an exam\n\n318\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.855\nquestion, they're trying to think,\nhow would this play out in the real world?\n\n319\n00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:19.036\nWell they can go to the IT service\nmanagement books, the ITIL books and say,\n\n320\n00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:20.241\nhm, they put it right here.\n\n321\n00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:23.310\nSo the things that an IT\norganization may face,\n\n322\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:27.700\nlet me build a scenario around\nthis particular challenge, right?\n\n323\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.150\nAnd thenn that challenge somehow faced\nthrough appropriate design of processes,\n\n324\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:37.620\nappropriate training of processes,\nintegration of processes etc, all right.\n\n325\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.120\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n326\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.860\n&gt;&gt; Moving to the service transition.\n\n327\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.590\nOf course the challenge of\nthe service transition,\n\n328\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.530\nas they are with service design,\nmanagement, stakeholders,\n\n329\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.210\nyou have a lot of stakeholders,\nyou have to manage a big group of people.\n\n330\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.760\nThe business is involved there,\ndesigners are involved,\n\n331\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.300\nyou've got operations people.\n\n332\n00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.850\nHere in transition you're\ntaking the download\n\n333\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.760\nfrom the service design\npackets from Service Design.\n\n334\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.490\nYou're helping form that out,\nat the same time,\n\n335\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.240\nyou're managing expectations\non the operation side.\n\n336\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.040\nBuilding a capability for\ninstance to support this new service,\n\n337\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.110\nplanning the training, planning the\ntesting, maintaining the environments for\n\n338\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.030\ntesting, building new things,\ntesting new things.\n\n339\n00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.919\nIts a very very busy place as well and\nyou have to satisfy a lots of masters.\n\n340\n00:17:20.919 --> 00:17:24.157\nThe design elements,\nthe service acceptance criteria,\n\n341\n00:17:24.157 --> 00:17:27.592\nright and you also satisfy\nthe ongoing operational value that\n\n342\n00:17:27.592 --> 00:17:31.372\nneeds to be delivered through that\nservices acceptance criteria.\n\n343\n00:17:31.372 --> 00:17:36.520\nSo again tough place to be, striking\nthat balance between taking a risk and\n\n344\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.690\ngetting things done and not causing\nharm is a big part of organisation.\n\n345\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.149\n&gt;&gt; And I like what you said about\nchallenges being about 100%, or\n\n346\n00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:48.191\na risk is a challenge that\nhas 100% chance of happening\n\n347\n00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:48.893\n&gt;&gt; A challenge.\n\n348\n00:17:48.893 --> 00:17:50.038\n&gt;&gt; A challenge.\n&gt;&gt; Is a risk.\n\n349\n00:17:50.038 --> 00:17:52.180\n&gt;&gt; Is a risk there is 100%\nchances of happening.\n\n350\n00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.700\n&gt;&gt; Love that.\n&gt;&gt; You will face this.\n\n351\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, a risk has different probabilities.\n\n352\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.780\nA challenge has 100% chance of happening.\n\n353\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.280\nYou will face these things.\n\n354\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.350\nAll right, good, so\na critical success factor for\n\n355\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.670\nservice transition is to have\ngood fences and good neighbors.\n\n356\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.130\nKnow what your design folks are doing,\nknow what operational people need.\n\n357\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.240\nThat's the good fences between them.\n\n358\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.920\nSo managing those expectations\namong those different stakeholders.\n\n359\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.745\nKnow what your throughput is,\nknow what your capabilities are.\n\n360\n00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:24.930\nThis integration part, automation, right?\n\n361\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:30.037\nI recall a great success story that\nwe had after many attempts and many\n\n362\n00:18:30.037 --> 00:18:35.690\nfailures at managing test environments\nversus production environments.\n\n363\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.363\nThe advent of virtualization helped us\ntremendously, when we could virtualize our\n\n364\n00:18:40.363 --> 00:18:44.905\nserver environments, basically take images\nof different things and pretty much\n\n365\n00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:49.809\nreplicate those environments, we got a lot\nbetter at managing our test environments.\n\n366\n00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:54.560\nTherefore we got a lot better at\npredicting the success of our launches qas\n\n367\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.590\nwe went forward, as an example, right?\n\n368\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.220\nSo having good tools and technology in\nplace so that you can make those happen,\n\n369\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.140\nhaving good data sets, having an effective\nconfiguration management system.\n\n370\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.400\nKeeping all your stuff in one sock so\nto speak.\n\n371\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.790\nIf you can keep all that stuff\norganize and up to date,\n\n372\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:18.358\nyou have a better chance\nof predicting success.\n\n373\n00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:22.700\nAll right, some of the risk, to continue\non with the risks of service transition.\n\n374\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.950\nThe moving landscape of accountability,\nof people changing roles.\n\n375\n00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.160\nThe business not engaging\nwith you appropriately.\n\n376\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.080\nYou alienate key support staff\nbecause they operation says, my gosh,\n\n377\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.040\nyou didn't even come talk\nto me about this, and\n\n378\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.080\nnow you want me to support it,\ngive me a break.\n\n379\n00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.100\nSo that's a risk,\nyou need to mitigate that risk,\n\n380\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.260\nyou want operations people involved,\nright?\n\n381\n00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:55.955\nAlienation of operation staff is\nnot a good idea, you resist change.\n\n382\n00:19:55.955 --> 00:19:59.300\nIt would be kind of silly for\ntransitional folks to resist change.\n\n383\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.140\nBut they're gonna face\na resistance to change.\n\n384\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.789\nThe stake holders in the customer group,\nthe stake holders in operations,\n\n385\n00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:08.936\neven the stake holders in service\ndesign may be averse to change.\n\n386\n00:20:08.936 --> 00:20:14.550\nYou're gonna have to face\nthat risk head on, right.\n\n387\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Changes, sorry.\n\n388\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.187\n&gt;&gt; Sing it David, sing it David.\n\n389\n00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:21.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Service operations, that's right.\n\n390\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.592\nI like this, poor coordination with\ndevelopment and project staff.\n\n391\n00:20:25.592 --> 00:20:26.920\nThe reason why I like it,\n\n392\n00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.285\nI'm not saying I like poor coordination, I\nlike the fact that it's highlighted here.\n\n393\n00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:34.518\nITIL, as mentioned in earlier episodes,\nITIL has a strong\n\n394\n00:20:34.518 --> 00:20:39.355\npredisposition to highlighting\nthe deficiency of not involving.\n\n395\n00:20:39.355 --> 00:20:43.625\nWhen you don't involve operational's folks\nyou have a better chance of failure,\n\n396\n00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:44.540\nall right?\n\n397\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:50.230\nSo a challenge for operation's people,\nis not being involved upstream with those\n\n398\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:55.230\ntransitional folks and with those design\nfolks or project staff, get them involved.\n\n399\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.830\nNow, I've seen this play out on\nthe MALC exam and other exams, for\n\n400\n00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.850\nthat matter,\nin the absence of operational involvement,\n\n401\n00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.470\nthere will be manifestations of risk,\nthey will pop up, right?\n\n402\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.340\nAnd the scenario may play\nout very explicitly saying\n\n403\n00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.440\nyou ignored the operations people,\nwell that's a red flag.\n\n404\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.140\nYou're gonna pick an answer that says\nhow we're gonna fix this in the future,\n\n405\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.380\nwe're gonna involve operations people.\n\n406\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.008\nIt might not be so drastic, it might\nbe more subtle, but the absence of\n\n407\n00:21:22.008 --> 00:21:26.950\noperational staff at the upper stages,\nI say upper, the earlier stages,\n\n408\n00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:32.070\ndesign and transition, could be a tell\ntale sign of failure later on, okay?\n\n409\n00:21:35.007 --> 00:21:38.460\nNotice some of these things,\nI like the second last bullet there.\n\n410\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.370\nService operation staff are held\naccountable for bad design.\n\n411\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.719\nAs an example,\nyou fail to design in good availability.\n\n412\n00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.590\nIt just goes all the way\nthrough transition,\n\n413\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.220\nit's not even tested very well.\n\n414\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.798\nIt gets into operation and\nnow you're operating a house of cards and\n\n415\n00:21:56.798 --> 00:21:58.131\nit falls over every day.\n\n416\n00:21:58.131 --> 00:22:00.195\nAnd the service desk gets\ncalled out every day for\n\n417\n00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.750\nhow long it them takes to\nrestore the darned thing.\n\n418\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.540\nThey just get beat up every day,\navailability's down,\n\n419\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.810\nthe response time is bad,\nwhat are you guys doing in operations?\n\n420\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:14.350\nSo operations is taking all the hits,\nI mean that's just the political\n\n421\n00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.770\nnature sometimes of organizations is well,\nit's happening in operations.\n\n422\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:25.310\nI know in my own experience, that was\nrecurring, we regularly found services\n\n423\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:30.040\nthat were not fit for purpose, they\nweren't quite ready for prime time, right.\n\n424\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.840\nAnd after a few questions or\na few iterances of just going and\n\n425\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.680\nfixing it, we said, wait a minute,\nwhere is this broken?\n\n426\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.840\nAnd it was upstream, it was up in\nservice design, so we got the attention\n\n427\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.210\nof that regime, so to speak,\nthose people up yonder, if you will.\n\n428\n00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.760\nAnd operations could\nconvince those design people\n\n429\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.050\neventually that these failures\nare costing us down here.\n\n430\n00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.640\nWhat can we do to fix it,\nwe had ideas about fixing it.\n\n431\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.150\nWe brought those ideas,\nthey resisted those changes.\n\n432\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.380\nWe got more outages, we came back again.\n\n433\n00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.130\nSo I understand the political dynamic,\n\n434\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.108\norganizational dynamic that\ngets in place sometimes here.\n\n435\n00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:10.770\nITIL simply gives you a roadmap or\na framework to say, you know what,\n\n436\n00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.940\nwe could do availability\nbetter if we designed it in.\n\n437\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.900\nHow is your availability\nmanagement process up there?\n\n438\n00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.160\nWe don't have one, hm,\nthings that make you go hm.\n\n439\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:22.925\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n440\n00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:24.865\nthat's what happens on\nthe MALC exam a lot,\n\n441\n00:23:24.865 --> 00:23:27.234\nthere will be manifestations of failure,\nsomehow.\n\n442\n00:23:27.234 --> 00:23:31.910\nAnd discerning where that failure was and\nhow you can shore it up is often,\n\n443\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:32.891\nin ITIL sense,\n\n444\n00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:37.963\nplugging in the right process with the\nright accountability at the right time.\n\n445\n00:23:37.963 --> 00:23:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Very good information.\n\n446\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\ncritical success factors for\n\n447\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.060\nservice operations is having\nmanagement support, right?\n\n448\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:51.614\nHaving senior support for funding and\nfor resourcing, having middle\n\n449\n00:23:51.614 --> 00:23:57.466\ntactical budgets awareness and stuff,\nand having that type of support.\n\n450\n00:23:57.466 --> 00:24:00.349\nSo not only strategic thinking\nat the executive level, but\n\n451\n00:24:00.349 --> 00:24:03.320\ntactical day to day thinking\nat the management level.\n\n452\n00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.322\nGetting that management support for\nthings you need in operations, right.\n\n453\n00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:12.170\nBusiness support, that the business\nsupports what you're doing, right?\n\n454\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.930\nBeing able to give value back\nto the business could mean,\n\n455\n00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:20.103\nShoring up your SM management process, or\n\n456\n00:24:20.103 --> 00:24:23.940\nmaking your problem management\nprocess a little bit better, right?\n\n457\n00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.870\nThose are operational processes\nthat need some meat some\n\n458\n00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.680\nmanagement support behind him.\n\n459\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.090\nAnd you can get business support for\n\n460\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:36.670\nthat, if you can show the value\nproposition of these processes, okay?\n\n461\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:41.350\nHaving champions,\nthis idea of champions just means you have\n\n462\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.490\nkey resources spread\nthroughout the location,\n\n463\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.370\nincluding within the business that like\nwhat IT does and wants to help them.\n\n464\n00:24:48.735 --> 00:24:52.520\nSuper users, I'll use that as\na potential example of a champion,\n\n465\n00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.330\nin the business there might be\nsomeone that gets along with IT,\n\n466\n00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.880\nnot just the organization but\ngets along with information technology.\n\n467\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.310\nThey're good at computers let's say,\n\n468\n00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.950\njust paraphrase a little bit,\nthey're really good at it.\n\n469\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.220\nHaving them out in\nthe field with the business\n\n470\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.240\nproviding interface to the business,\nas a trusted member of the business, and\n\n471\n00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.235\nalso providing interface to the IT\norganization as a trusted member of IT,\n\n472\n00:25:14.235 --> 00:25:18.620\ncan be a very effective way\nto kind of bridge the gap\n\n473\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.595\nbetween the business people, the users\nif you will and the IT organization.\n\n474\n00:25:23.595 --> 00:25:27.830\nHave those champions spread out across\nthe organization can be very helpful.\n\n475\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.300\nAnd not just within the business side,\n\n476\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.240\nhaving those champions spread out\nthrough out your IT organization\n\n477\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.750\nat the strategic level, at the design\nlevel, at the transition level.\n\n478\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.170\nHaving those champions in play as well.\n\n479\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.670\nOkay, as relates to some risks\nassociated with service operation.\n\n480\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.310\nWell they go hand and\nhand with some challenges.\n\n481\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:51.810\nInsufficient funding, not enough time,\nnot enough money, not enough servers,\n\n482\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.330\nnot enough phone lines, not enough\nheadsets, wherever that might be.\n\n483\n00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.420\nLost of momentum, you're trying to\nimplement something really good and\n\n484\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.020\njust kind of lose interest and\nit kind of falls away.\n\n485\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.330\nYou don't keep the momentum going.\n\n486\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:09.770\nThe continual improvement cycle can be\ncontinual, right, tend to be continual.\n\n487\n00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.450\nAnd you just kind of grow tired of it and\nyou can't keep that momentum going.\n\n488\n00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.080\nVery tough risk to manage there.\n\n489\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.460\nYou lose key personnel, right.\n\n490\n00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.160\nServer could be hurt,\nturnover can be there.\n\n491\n00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.530\nYou don't have the management support.\n\n492\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.590\nYou have faulty designs,\nalways keeping your life miserable.\n\n493\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.350\nThings fall over all the time,\n\n494\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.460\nit can be a tough place to work\nwhen everything is failing.\n\n495\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.390\nSo these are some of\nthe risks you might face.\n\n496\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.280\nAnd obviously they're closely related\nto the challenges involved as well.\n\n497\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.300\nNow what about CSI?\n\n498\n00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:38.960\nWhy have it?\n\n499\n00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.110\nI've mentioned it and I've placed it as\nbeing holistic and around everything.\n\n500\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.010\nIt's not just a stage that\nyou do after operations.\n\n501\n00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.710\nIt's something that's embedded,\nshould be embedded,\n\n502\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.260\nin all stages of the life cycle and\nshould be embedded in the way you work.\n\n503\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.840\nYou think in terms of improvement which\nmeans you think in terms of measurement.\n\n504\n00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.740\nYou think in terms of\nmonitoring that measurement and\n\n505\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.190\nresponding to those measurements, right?\n\n506\n00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:08.940\nSo, in the absence of management,\ncommitment to CSI,\n\n507\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.920\nit could definitely fall apart,\nbecause it is a cultural thing, not just\n\n508\n00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.600\na little process you're supposed to\nfollow, but a way you're supposed to work.\n\n509\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.660\nIf you don't have management behind you,\nit's probably gonna fall,\n\n510\n00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.490\nit's probably gonna fail.\n\n511\n00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.670\nSo make sure you get management involved,\nso we'll put in resources, budget and\n\n512\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:30.270\ntime, a commitment to this idea of\ncontinual improvement is pretty\n\n513\n00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.750\ngood, very important.\n\n514\n00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.780\nSo the challenges associated with CSI is\nnot understanding how the impacts of your\n\n515\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.920\npotential ideas can be articulated\nin business terms, right?\n\n516\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.040\nIt's one thing to say, we're going to\nimprove incident management process.\n\n517\n00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.770\nWell good, thanks for doing that.\n\n518\n00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.920\nAnd the customer says, what's an incident\nmanagement process, why do I care?\n\n519\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:59.405\nHow do you translate an improvement of\nan IT process into business terms, right?\n\n520\n00:27:59.405 --> 00:28:02.370\nIt's a rhetorical question but that's\ndefinitely a question you need to be able\n\n521\n00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:06.055\nto answer fairly authoritatively\nwhen it comes to a MALC exam.\n\n522\n00:28:06.055 --> 00:28:10.250\nAs you're on this exam you are trying to\nfilter out through the various answers,\n\n523\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.410\nyou're gonna be looking for those answers\nthat focus on the business impact\n\n524\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.070\nof your decision to improve, all right.\n\n525\n00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.955\nNow, back in to the office,\nthe same thing is in play.\n\n526\n00:28:19.955 --> 00:28:24.085\nIt's one thing to say, I'd like to\nintroduce a new IT service management\n\n527\n00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:28.045\nsuite of tools, because I wanna manage\nchange management, incident management and\n\n528\n00:28:28.045 --> 00:28:29.525\nproblem management better.\n\n529\n00:28:29.525 --> 00:28:33.295\nRight now spending this amount of money\nwith six different spreadsheets for\n\n530\n00:28:33.295 --> 00:28:37.175\nthat unit, and this other unit has two or\nthree other spreadsheets that they use for\n\n531\n00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:39.365\nchange management, it's just a mess.\n\n532\n00:28:39.365 --> 00:28:44.490\nWe'll save money if we standardize,\nall that I've just said could all be true.\n\n533\n00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.880\nAnd saving money could\nbe a business value,\n\n534\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.770\nmaybe the business want to save money.\n\n535\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.090\nThat's also true, but\nwhat about business impact, right?\n\n536\n00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.120\nTranslate that saving of money or\ntranslate that streamlined process,\n\n537\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.050\nof standardization process to something\nthat the business cares about.\n\n538\n00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.930\nAs an example, if you have better change\nmanagement, better incident management and\n\n539\n00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:11.090\nbetter problem management, when there\nare outages you will recover more quickly.\n\n540\n00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.620\nYou will be less likely to have\nthose outages come back, and\n\n541\n00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.870\nyou'll fix them more quickly and\nefficiently.\n\n542\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:22.480\nAnd you will cause less harm\nas you go about fixing things.\n\n543\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.220\nTherefore, customer,\nyou will experience less downtime and\n\n544\n00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.350\nless disruption to your service.\n\n545\n00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.230\nDing, ding, ding, now I start to ring\nin the bells of the customer saying,\n\n546\n00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.870\nyou mean I won't have to wait two\ndays to file that report next month?\n\n547\n00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.590\nNo you won't, it'll be there for\nyou next month.\n\n548\n00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.080\nSo you're talking about business outcomes,\nand that's what business wants to hear.\n\n549\n00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.220\nGet used to translating your IT outcomes\n\n550\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.450\nto business outcomes, or\nyour IT improvements to business outcomes.\n\n551\n00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.107\nGet used to that operationally,\nas well as on the exams.\n\n552\n00:29:57.107 --> 00:29:59.149\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n553\n00:29:59.149 --> 00:30:02.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so some risks\nassociated with CSI are clearly,\n\n554\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.720\nif you don't have the management buy-in,\nwe've talked about this earlier.\n\n555\n00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.770\nYou don't have management buy-in,\nyou don't have the toolsets,\n\n556\n00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.310\nyou don't have the ability to measure,\nyou're lacking a measurement framework.\n\n557\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.930\nWith the lack of measurement, you're not\ngoing to be able to manage very well.\n\n558\n00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.470\nYou need to show some objective data to\nmove through your improvement cycles,\n\n559\n00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.040\nobjective data.\n\n560\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.460\nSo if you're promising faster reports,\n\n561\n00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.070\nmore accurate reports, you're measuring\nspeed and you're measuring accuracy.\n\n562\n00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.378\nThat's what you should be measuring, and\n\n563\n00:30:28.378 --> 00:30:32.020\nthe absence of that measurement,\nyou can only tell part of the story.\n\n564\n00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.880\nYou can say, well my service was up.\n\n565\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.950\nWell, that's good,\nI'm glad your service was up, but\n\n566\n00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.120\nare we actually generating\nreports more quickly?\n\n567\n00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.630\nAre they actually more accurate?\n\n568\n00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.470\nSo connecting the dots\nbetween the measurement and\n\n569\n00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:48.090\nthe business is also a big risk that you\nneed to mitigate, make sure of that.\n\n570\n00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:53.540\nImplementing improvements means\nimplementing change, it can be big,\n\n571\n00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:58.680\nit can be small, but you're changing\nsomething if you're improving something.\n\n572\n00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.610\nAnd the stakeholders you\nmight have to manage\n\n573\n00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.910\ncould be a large group of stakeholders or\na small group of stakeholders.\n\n574\n00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.920\nThe stakeholders could have different\nattitudes about what you're doing.\n\n575\n00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.040\nThey may be very excited about the change,\n\n576\n00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.270\nthey may be very apathetic\nabout the change, right.\n\n577\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.240\nSo you got all that dynamic playing\nout when you're talking about\n\n578\n00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.298\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n579\n00:31:18.298 --> 00:31:23.120\nSo recognizing CSI as a disruptive force,\nand\n\n580\n00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.820\nI say disruptive in a positive way,\nis what you really need to understand, and\n\n581\n00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:35.090\nbring forth with business commitment and\nwith management commitment.\n\n582\n00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:40.120\nSCSI, that's actually looking at managing\nsuccess across all the life cycle stages.\n\n583\n00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.560\nFundamental to that is\nthe ability to measure,\n\n584\n00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.210\nfundamental of that is the ability to\nmanage all stakeholders effectively and\n\n585\n00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.890\nfundamental of that is\nto focus on business.\n\n586\n00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:54.090\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job Terry, I tell MALC\nmanaging success across the life cycle\n\n587\n00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.370\nthere is so\nmuch more content in the I tell libraries.\n\n588\n00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.570\nSo many videos that you can actually\nwatch and I encourage you to watch them,\n\n589\n00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.130\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n590\n00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.160\nAnd thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n591\n00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.950\nRemember a good ITPro is always learning.\n\n592\n00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.010\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n593\n00:32:10.010 -->

00:00:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.980\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.670\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with ITIL MALK.\n\n6\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.790\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is governance across the life cycle.\n\n7\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.350\nAnd the only person I can think of who\ncan help us here is Terry Decker and\n\n8\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.020\nhe's right here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.045\nHere's Terry, right here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you much, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.970\nHappy to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.340\nAnd governance, what is governance?\n\n13\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.720\nGovernance across the what is governance?\n\n14\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.868\nWhat's it mean to you Zach?\n\n15\n00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:45.410\n&gt;&gt; Watching over, protecting,\nmaking sure it's all running smoothly.\n\n16\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, keeping within the lines,\nso to speak.\n\n17\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Good examples, making sure it's running\n\n18\n00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.090\nsmoothly, within the lines,\nyou're coloring within the lines, etc.\n\n19\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.280\nWhat are the sources of governance,\ncould I ask you that?\n\n20\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.870\n&gt;&gt; Zach, what are sources of governance?\n\n21\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.650\nOr motivators of governance?\n\n22\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.255\n&gt;&gt; Motivators, well let's see, we have\na Governor of the state of Florida.\n\n23\n00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:06.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good point.\n\n24\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.220\nYou got mayors.\n\n25\n00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Certainly mayors, I mean anyone in an\noffice in power, chief executive officer,\n\n26\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.350\nfor instance.\n\n27\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.810\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\nSo there you talk about corporate,\n\n28\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.530\nwe talk about CEOs.\n\n29\n00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, CEOs.\n\n30\n00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.090\n&gt;&gt; He has some governance, so\nthe business has governance.\n\n31\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.410\n&gt;&gt; I like how this is going.\n\n32\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.210\nSo, and then how do CEOs or other\nexecutives articulate the boundaries?\n\n33\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.410\nHow do they do that?\n\n34\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.230\n&gt;&gt; Delegation of duties, I mean.\n\n35\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, description of goals and\nresponsibilities,\n\n36\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470\nthe delegation of duties is part of it,\nthat's right, policies, right?\n\n37\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.690\nEven processes, here's how you do this.\n\n38\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.560\nFollow this process, don't follow that,\ndon't just make it up,\n\n39\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.670\nfollow this process is also a way\nwe keep in within the lines, right?\n\n40\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.970\nSo I definitely appreciate Zach's\ncontributions there as it relates to\n\n41\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.880\nthe people factor.\n\n42\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.930\nYou delegate responsibilities.\n\n43\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.260\nWe know people that are responsible for\nthis.\n\n44\n00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.820\nRight.\nSo\n\n45\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.120\nthe CFO has responsibilities for finance.\n\n46\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.910\nRight?\nThe CIO has responsibilities for IT.\n\n47\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.240\nThat's part of governance.\n\n48\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.470\nRight?\nWe have people involved in this.\n\n49\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.100\nThere's even a cultural\ndynamic to governance.\n\n50\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.640\nRight?\nThere's certain ethical behaviors\n\n51\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.300\nthat go assumed in many walks of life.\n\n52\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.880\nRight?\n\n53\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.490\nIncluding the corporate walks of life.\n\n54\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.150\nThere's ethical concerns there\nthat generally play out.\n\n55\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.270\nBeing fair to others,\n&gt;&gt; Right, being open, not discriminatory,\n\n56\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.590\nvarious things like that.\n\n57\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.330\nSome of them come from\noutside organization.\n\n58\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.800\nCertainly the CEO sets guidelines and\npolicies.\n\n59\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.230\nThe CIO has guidelines,\npolicies, processes, etc.\n\n60\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.010\nBut the federal government, the state\ngovernment, perhaps local governments,\n\n61\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.910\nare also playing into this\nfabric of governments that.\n\n62\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.640\nTell us how we're supposed to behave at\nany given time in addition to the cultural\n\n63\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.580\nelements of ethics and morality\nare also playing into those as well.\n\n64\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.930\nSo governance is a broad fabric.\n\n65\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.890\nIt covers lots of different things but\nas Zach pointed out,\n\n66\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.760\ngenerally what it's trying to do is\nkeeping us in order Keeping us in line\n\n67\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.188\nwith certain objectives at certain amount\nof times, within certain contexts.\n\n68\n00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:06.350\n&gt;&gt; And with governance we need to take\nthat 5000 foot view I'm sure, yeah?\n\n69\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nonce again we're doing that.\n\n70\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.872\nIf we're looking at managing\nacross the life cycle,\n\n71\n00:03:10.872 --> 00:03:14.046\nI entitle this particular episode\nGovernance across the Life Cycle.\n\n72\n00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:19.810\nAt that 5000 foot view, how do we have the\nappropriate governance in place, right.\n\n73\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.190\nSo, let's take a look first of all\nthird bullet here is pretty telling,\n\n74\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.630\na good tell tell sign you might\nfind on your MAC exam and\n\n75\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.180\nalso back at the office\nis that IT governance is\n\n76\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.450\nsomehow viewed as something separate\n&gt;&gt; From the business governance.\n\n77\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.350\nYou come up with your own policies and\nyou come up with your own practices.\n\n78\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.940\nThat's the tail wagging the dog.\n\n79\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.740\nIT should harmonize with\nbusiness governance,\n\n80\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.100\nwhatever your organizational\ngovernance is.\n\n81\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.710\nSo the IT organization, while it's\ngoing to have subsets of policy, and\n\n82\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.190\ncertainly have subsets of regulations,\nperhaps, or policies,\n\n83\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.598\nbest used policies here and\nthose kind of things.\n\n84\n00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:03.100\nThose should be in complete harmony\nwith the business objectives\n\n85\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.390\nthrough the business governance framework.\n\n86\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.540\nBusiness governance framework should\ninform the IT governance framework,\n\n87\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.110\nnot the other way around.\n\n88\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.250\nOkay.\n\n89\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.060\nSo, why govern?\n\n90\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.640\nAs we talked about, to evaluate,\nto direct or to monitor.\n\n91\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.210\nThat's right, three primary activities for\n\n92\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.520\nsetting the strategy, setting the policy\nand plans for an organization.\n\n93\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.480\nYou're trying to move people\nin the right direction, right.\n\n94\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.770\nOr you're trying to monitor to\nmake sure they're complying, or\n\n95\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.070\nyou're evaluating the overall\neffectiveness of this, right?\n\n96\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.070\nIt could be in all kinds of\ncategories of activities.\n\n97\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.420\nHow do we manage our money?\n\n98\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.450\nHow do we manage our security?\n\n99\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.420\nHow do we manage our use of the internet?\n\n100\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.620\nHow do we manage privacy,\nhow do we manage patient records,\n\n101\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.770\nhow do we manage customer contacts and\nsupply of contracts.\n\n102\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.990\nAll sorts of things.\n\n103\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.570\nThis governance factor can be in play\nacross all of the different spectrum\n\n104\n00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.760\nof IT service management.\n\n105\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.110\nGovernment activities, the evaluation\npart, pretty straight forward here,\n\n106\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.080\non going evaluation of how you're doing,\n\n107\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.530\nare you coloring within the lines,\nright, basically.\n\n108\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.210\nEvaluating your fabric of\ngovernance if you will and\n\n109\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.480\nmaking sure that it's a sustainable right?\n\n110\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.400\nSo you do this,\nperhaps acceptable use of the internet.\n\n111\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.710\nYou probably all had to\nsign off on a policy,\n\n112\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.830\nthe things you can do while you're at\nwork while you're surfing the internet\n\n113\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.010\nare different than what\nyou can do at home, right?\n\n114\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.930\nAcceptable use, right?\n\n115\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.310\nHow do we manage patient records?\n\n116\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.240\nWhat care do we take here?\n\n117\n00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.260\nAll these different factors are gonna\nbe fed by different stakeholders at\n\n118\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.780\ndifferent times, including external\nstakeholders such as the government or\n\n119\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.300\nregulatory agencies, etc., okay?\n\n120\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.010\nSo you're evaluating how you are going\nto assess your governance needs.\n\n121\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Governance needs,\n\n122\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.650\nof course you can also use it to direct.\n\n123\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.810\nTo motivate people in the right direction.\n\n124\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.940\nSet a policy, thou shall do this or\nthou shall not do that,\n\n125\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.040\nthose types of things\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.000\n&gt;&gt; You are directing people's activities.\n\n127\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.900\nYou are giving them orders if you will.\n\n128\n00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.930\nYou are giving them specific directives\non how they are supposed to behave.\n\n129\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.459\nI remember we had related\nto IT service management.\n\n130\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.800\nWe had a rash over many months of\nunauthorized changes causing harm, right?\n\n131\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.550\nAnd, it got so bad and so impactful with\nmajor outages affecting major services,\n\n132\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.550\nthat it got executives attention says,\nwhy is this happening?\n\n133\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.810\nAnd, the root cause was, Johnny did\nthis and didn't tell anybody, so\n\n134\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.870\nthe reason why it took us so long to get\nback up is we didn't know Johnny did this.\n\n135\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.292\nWe were chasing other windmills instead\nof that windmill, that sort of thing.\n\n136\n00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:52.940\nAand again,\nthat's just kind of a superficial example.\n\n137\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.700\nI over-simplified it a little bit,\nbut in the end, the root cause was,\n\n138\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.520\nwe don't have control of\nour change management.\n\n139\n00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.040\nWhat is up with that?\n\n140\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.870\nAnd we responded to the governance\nfactors, we had business people involved,\n\n141\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.850\nwe had IT executives involved saying\nwhat's going on here, and again,\n\n142\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.240\nthe analysis was,\nwe're not in control of our change.\n\n143\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.000\nWell, get in control of your change.\n\n144\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.670\nAnd we said well we have a process,\nbut no one's following it.\n\n145\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.250\nWhy aren't they following it?\n\n146\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.080\nThey don't have to.\n\n147\n00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.830\nTheir boss says it's bureaucracy.\n\n148\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.090\nOkay, we're gonna stop that,\nand then policy came out.\n\n149\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.510\nThou shalt not execute changes\n\n150\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.680\nwithout going through the change\nmanagement process basically, right?\n\n151\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.590\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; So it became a directive,\n\n152\n00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.810\na policy that back to the process, right?\n\n153\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.330\nAnd then we started getting people\nactually using the process,\n\n154\n00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.830\nwe certainly found opportunities for\nthe improvement of the process.\n\n155\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.380\nWe certainly found opportunities where it\nwas not completely fit for purpose, so\n\n156\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.910\nwe fixed the process.\n\n157\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.180\nBefore, we didn't have the indications\nit was even broken, the process,\n\n158\n00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.981\nbecause it wasn't even being followed.\n\n159\n00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:56.826\nAnd because it wasn't being followed,\n\n160\n00:07:56.826 --> 00:07:59.277\nwe found the real problems\nacross the organization.\n\n161\n00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:03.057\nSo again, this is to simplify\nthe example of how- Policy and\n\n162\n00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:05.590\nprocess are providing the governance.\n\n163\n00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:11.214\nYou're directing people to\nbehave in a particular way.\n\n164\n00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:14.498\n&gt;&gt; And it was probably Don Quixote\nthat made that determination.\n\n165\n00:08:14.498 --> 00:08:15.335\n&gt;&gt; It was, long ago, that's right.\n\n166\n00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:15.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:17.446\n&gt;&gt; It was Don Quixote that figured\nwhat that whole thing was, right?\n\n168\n00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:20.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Desdemona was nowhere to be found on\n\n169\n00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:23.047\nthat particular night, he as sleepless,\nsleepless on the plain.\n\n170\n00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:26.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here we are,\n\n171\n00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:27.835\nthe directing part of it.\n\n172\n00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:29.965\nAnd then you have the monitoring piece.\n\n173\n00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:33.860\nThe monitoring is keeping up,\nare you keeping score?\n\n174\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.483\nSo you got the evaluation that\nwe should have, let's say,\n\n175\n00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.150\nchange management process.\n\n176\n00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.500\nYou got a policy that says, thou shalt\nfollow the change management process.\n\n177\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.170\nSo you got the evaluation piece\nthat the process is necessary,\n\n178\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.230\nyou got the directive piece that\ndemands people follow it or\n\n179\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.810\nelse they'll be fired or subject to\ndisciplinary action, that sort of thing.\n\n180\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.360\nSo you got the policy backing, and\nthen what about the on-going monitoring?\n\n181\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.350\nAre you following it?\n\n182\n00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.350\nAre you actually doing it?\n\n183\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.730\nSo it's almost like auditing here, right?\n\n184\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.200\nAre you following the process?\n\n185\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.120\nMonitoring and\n\n186\n00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.330\nkeeping score after the fact is also\nan important part of governance.\n\n187\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.338\nI give you an idea from\nthe financial management world.\n\n188\n00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:16.087\nI'm not steeped on this, I'm not\na financial manager, I never was, right?\n\n189\n00:09:16.087 --> 00:09:21.175\nBut my understanding is that one\nof the regulatory responses to\n\n190\n00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:27.895\nsome of the financial management practices\nof some of the not so up-and-coming.\n\n191\n00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:30.680\nEnron, I think,\nwere played in other world, kind of,\n\n192\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.960\nthe hiding profit lost to get their\nstocks up, and then cashing out later on.\n\n193\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.630\nThat practice was found to be dubious.\n\n194\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.055\nRegulations came out that says,\nwe're not going to do that anymore.\n\n195\n00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:43.100\nSarbanes-Oxley is a particular regulation,\nor a set,\n\n196\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.410\na suite of regulations that says, we're\ngoing to change your financial management\n\n197\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.970\nreporting, technicians, or techniques.\n\n198\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.390\nSo in the case of monitoring,\nthe government can monitor and\n\n199\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.220\nthey do, monthly, submit your reports.\n\n200\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.760\nAnd there is a brush of an audit and\n\n201\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.690\nthose reports are complying\nwith the basic templates.\n\n202\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.640\nThey're following the basic parameters.\n\n203\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.230\nAny negative findings are identified and\n\n204\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.930\nreported back to the organization\nsaying nope, you messed up here.\n\n205\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.550\nAnd those could be so egregious that\nthe company gets a fine, right?\n\n206\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.780\nSo it's not just monitoring with a stick\nbehind it, there's a carrot do this right.\n\n207\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.130\nThere's also the stick to slap\na company across the wrist or\n\n208\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:29.340\nworse if they're not complying with the\nspirit and letter of those regulations.\n\n209\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.050\nSo again, that's an example\nof monitoring compliance.\n\n210\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.420\nThis done through regulatory channels.\n\n211\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.020\nDown on the ground here in IT, not so\n\n212\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.210\nmuch worried about government\nregulator necessarily.\n\n213\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.440\nYou could be monitoring\nthe effectiveness of your process' and\n\n214\n00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.590\nthe effect, and\nactually are they being complied with.\n\n215\n00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.820\nSo monitoring against compliance.\n\n216\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Cause and effect,\ntruth and consequences.\n\n217\n00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n218\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.890\nSo all we've been talking about really\nis kind of the framework of governance.\n\n219\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.590\nI mentioned policy, I mentioned process.\n\n220\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.130\nI even mentioned culture, the ethical\nmoral standards that come into play.\n\n221\n00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.910\nAnd, there's a standard out\nhere called ISO/IEC 38500,\n\n222\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.870\nwhich gives the six principal domains\nof governance, and they talk about, and\n\n223\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.020\nthis is the one that Zach\nwas good to point out.\n\n224\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.340\nAssign responsibility,\ndelegate appropriate authorities.\n\n225\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.120\nAnd you give those authorities power.\n\n226\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.410\nNow they're accountable for it and\nyou've got skin in the game.\n\n227\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.940\nLiterally a person is\nplaying this game out.\n\n228\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.180\nThey have responsibilities.\n\n229\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.140\nSo, if you hire a security manager or if\nyou name or delegate a security manager,\n\n230\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.280\nsomeone that's going to take\ncare of IT security for\n\n231\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.550\nyou, then they now have accountability.\n\n232\n00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.340\nThey get paid because they're good at\nbeing accountable for security management.\n\n233\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.620\nNow they have a stake in the game.\n\n234\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.840\nThe organization has a stake,\nnow an individual has a stake.\n\n235\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.980\nSo again, the first one,\nestablish responsibilities.\n\n236\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.681\nLet's consider that an ITIL framework,\nan ITIL context.\n\n237\n00:11:57.681 --> 00:12:01.880\nOne of the key fundamental\ndrivers of accountability\n\n238\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.120\nin ITIL is coming up with ownership.\n\n239\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.590\nThe idea of service ownership.\n\n240\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.720\nWe've talk about the service\nowner being accountable for\n\n241\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.270\nthe service they own, right?\n\n242\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.910\nThey make sure they are accountable.\n\n243\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:17.930\nThey get paid to be good at making\nsure their service is of good quality.\n\n244\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.950\nThat's their job, right?\n\n245\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.720\nSo your building in this governance\nframework just by assigning ownership.\n\n246\n00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.450\nFurther related to ITIL,\nprocess ownership.\n\n247\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.390\nYou're putting a stake in\nthe ground when you say,\n\n248\n00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.720\nwe're gonna have an availability\nmanagement process.\n\n249\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.630\nThe stake's in the ground is when you\nactually appoint a process owner for\n\n250\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.710\navailability management or for incident\nmanagement or for problem management.\n\n251\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.730\nThese 26 processes, so as you're taking\nthe exam, and actually back at the office,\n\n252\n00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:52.470\nif you think you're practicing a process,\nfind that process owner.\n\n253\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.250\nAnd if none exists,\nthen you're missing the ITIL train.\n\n254\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.880\nThe ITIL train would say, you don't have\na process without process ownership.\n\n255\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.040\nThey're the ones that shepherds,\nowns and operates that process.\n\n256\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.800\nNot operates, but owns and is accountable.\n\n257\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.310\nFor that process and the quality thereof.\n\n258\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.460\nThat's ITIL's idea of ownership and\n\n259\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.830\nit's establishing responsibilities,\npassing those things out.\n\n260\n00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.560\n&gt;&gt; That's the ITIL train\non the ITIL island.\n\n261\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.020\n&gt;&gt; That's really good, that's right.\n\n262\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.610\nITIL train latch on, that's very good.\n\n263\n00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.085\nMixing metaphors there,\nITIL train on an ITIL island.\n\n264\n00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:28.570\nGet on a train, get on the island,\nbut it's a big enough island.\n\n265\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Plenty of railroad, I like it.\n\n266\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n267\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Now, conformance, basically conforming\nwith it, you can measure this, right?\n\n268\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.030\nYou can measure that people are actually\ncomplying with a process, so do so.\n\n269\n00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.260\nCome up with a framework for conformance,\ncome up with a framework of processes.\n\n270\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.550\nMeasurement is a form of auditing,\nor a form of governance.\n\n271\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.610\nIf you're keeping score on how\nwell the process is behaving,\n\n272\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.420\nyou're building in some\naccountability there.\n\n273\n00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.130\nIf you are the process owner\nof change management, and\n\n274\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.830\nyou have determined that the best way\nto measure change management is with\n\n275\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.250\nthree metrics, and\nyou've got three metrics that are key.\n\n276\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.960\nAnd, you've enabled\nthe measurement of that.\n\n277\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.060\nAnd, people are keeping score.\n\n278\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.790\nAnd, you're always bad at it.\n\n279\n00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.730\nThen as a change management process owner,\nyou have data that suggests if everyone's\n\n280\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.610\nbad at it, then, maybe, your process\nneeds to be improved, perhaps.\n\n281\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.750\nMaybe your training of\nthe process needs to be improved.\n\n282\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.710\nMaybe your tool set that supports\nthe process needs to be improved.\n\n283\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.800\nWho knows?\n\n284\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.700\nBut you're keeping score, right?\n\n285\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.870\nSo even measurement is a form of\ngovernance because it's a way to assess\n\n286\n00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.930\nwhether or\nnot you're on the right path, okay.\n\n287\n00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.120\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Again, coloring\n\n288\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.319\nbetween the lines, right?\n\n289\n00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.403\nAnd of course, ensure respect for\nhuman factors.\n\n290\n00:14:46.403 --> 00:14:50.157\nThis isn't meant to be inhumane at all,\nit's meant to be governing people,\n\n291\n00:14:50.157 --> 00:14:51.545\nunderstanding the moral and\n\n292\n00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:54.290\nethical implications of\nthe policies you're making.\n\n293\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.210\nI remember someone, an authority,\n\n294\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.150\nonce told me, I don't care how\nlong it takes you and your team.\n\n295\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.150\nI want you to stay here\nuntil these things are down.\n\n296\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.750\nThis number of tickets or\nwhatever is down to this, right.\n\n297\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.240\nAnd I looked at the list and I looked at\nthe three people that worked for me and\n\n298\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.265\nwe, literally we would have had to have\nbeen in there for three days straight.\n\n299\n00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:19.608\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I appreciate the governance, I do.\n\n300\n00:15:19.608 --> 00:15:22.362\nI appreciate the motivation,\nI appreciate the work log.\n\n301\n00:15:22.362 --> 00:15:26.540\nI totally understand the spirit of what\nthis person was asking me to do, but\n\n302\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.290\nI begged to differ that we were gonna\nbe there three consecutive days,\n\n303\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.330\n24 hours a day.\n\n304\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.050\nSo again, talking about the governance\nfactors and how you play these things in.\n\n305\n00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.920\nDon't do unethical things.\n\n306\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.990\nDon't do unworkable things, etc.\n\n307\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.680\nSo how does corporate governance of IT?\n\n308\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.227\nHow does corporate govern IT?\n\n309\n00:15:52.227 --> 00:15:54.816\nInteresting question here.\n\n310\n00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:57.720\nPrimarily this is done through\nsome sort of board of governors,\n\n311\n00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.510\nyou've got the people in play, start off\nwith the delegation responsibilities.\n\n312\n00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.512\nAnd you have executives in\nplay The executives might be\n\n313\n00:16:04.512 --> 00:16:08.370\nthe executives from each of the business\nunits in your organization.\n\n314\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.880\nMaybe the financial officer,\nmaybe HR director.\n\n315\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.540\nThe head of research and development,\nthe head of manufacturing, as an example.\n\n316\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:21.587\nMaybe they're part of this executive team\nand those executives need to work with\n\n317\n00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:26.424\nthe IT executives to create some sort of\ndirection that IT should be going in.\n\n318\n00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:29.559\nDon't just go spend about your money on\na virtualization project unless you can\n\n319\n00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:32.249\nprove to me that there's gonna be\nsome business value, all right.\n\n320\n00:16:32.249 --> 00:16:36.155\nSo the corporation is governing IT and\nIT's behavior, and\n\n321\n00:16:36.155 --> 00:16:41.245\nthe primary vehicle for doing that is\nshown here is the IT's steering group.\n\n322\n00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:44.581\nI'm not sure if that's the familiar\nterm with a broad audience, but\n\n323\n00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:46.060\nis very familiar to me.\n\n324\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.850\nWorking in a large organization,\nwe certainly had an IT steering group.\n\n325\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.610\nNow if you work for\n\n326\n00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.050\na small organization, you might\nnot call it an IT Steering Group.\n\n327\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:17:00.155\nIt might be that the CIO is also the CEO,\nthe President, and the HR Director.\n\n328\n00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:03.668\nIn a small organization, there could\nbe lots of people wearing lots of hats.\n\n329\n00:17:03.668 --> 00:17:05.630\nTotally get that, right?\n\n330\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:11.280\nBut the concept of dividing and\nconquering the business aspects and\n\n331\n00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.840\nthe IT aspects, and providing\nthe governance between the business and\n\n332\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.470\nIT is what this is talking about.\n\n333\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.380\nSo even if a lot of people are wearing\nlots of hats, this technique\n\n334\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.870\nof dividing and conquering the\nresponsibilities and accountabilities for\n\n335\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.092\nwho decides, what money is spent for\nwhat purposes is what this is about?\n\n336\n00:17:29.092 --> 00:17:32.080\nAll right, so as you look at here again,\n\n337\n00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.620\nthis is example here has the board of\ngovernors at the top of the organization.\n\n338\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.850\nYou have the executive offices\nwithin the organization.\n\n339\n00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.680\nAnd then you have some sort of interface\nbetween the executive officers, and\n\n340\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.260\nthe IT function.\n\n341\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.560\nAnd typically that's called\nthe IT Steering Group.\n\n342\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.350\nBy steering,\nyou can see the strategic nature of it.\n\n343\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.560\nIt's intent to put things\nin the right direction.\n\n344\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.070\nIt's not tactical.\n\n345\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.520\nIt's very strategic.\n\n346\n00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.950\nHow much money you gonna have?\n\n347\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.010\nWhat kind of value are you\nsupposed to be bringing?\n\n348\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.003\nAgain, imagine that steering group for\nBarnes &amp; Noble for Amazon.com.\n\n349\n00:18:05.003 --> 00:18:10.080\nAnd that steering group discussion\nafter the advent of Amazon.com, right?\n\n350\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.158\nTo be successful in this business,\n\n351\n00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:16.387\nwe're gonna have to change our business\nmodel a little bit from brick and\n\n352\n00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:21.403\nmortar only, to brick and mortar plus\ndelivery through Internet services, right?\n\n353\n00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:23.610\nWe're gonna have to make that switch.\n\n354\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.615\nWe do we need a NOOK?\n\n355\n00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:30.360\nThe e-reader to versus the Kindle,\nand what are we gonna do, right?\n\n356\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.120\nWell, that was a lot of strategic\nthinking from the corporate executives.\n\n357\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.793\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n358\n00:18:34.793 --> 00:18:38.141\nAnd getting IT involved through\nthe steering group to say yes,\n\n359\n00:18:38.141 --> 00:18:40.870\nhere's the money go make this happen,\nall right.\n\n360\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n361\n00:18:43.783 --> 00:18:46.530\n&gt;&gt; So then how does service\nstrategy relate to governance?\n\n362\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.400\nIn a nutshell, what service strategy does,\nwithin the IT context,\n\n363\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.260\nwithin the ITIL service\nmanagement context.\n\n364\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:59.110\nWithin that context what service strategy\ndoes for governance is set the direction.\n\n365\n00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:04.140\nSo if you've got the IT steering group\nis where the business gets to steer IT.\n\n366\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.110\nService strategy is to set\na processes where IT gets to steer\n\n367\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.310\nthe IT organization.\n\n368\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.400\nSo it's a subset below\nthe IT Steering Group.\n\n369\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.500\nObviously, synergy's between\nthe steering group and\n\n370\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.200\nservice strategy need to be built.\n\n371\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.250\nService strategy practitioners\nare answering the call\n\n372\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.030\nthat comes from the IT Steering Group.\n\n373\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.290\nThat's what they're trying to get done.\n\n374\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.500\nThat's it in a nutshell.\n\n375\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.060\nSo financial management,\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n376\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.900\nunderstanding demand, having all these\nprocesses in play, the portfolio,\n\n377\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.850\nwhat services should we be\noffering gives you a context.\n\n378\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.865\nOutside of service management,\nif you're just providing solutions,\n\n379\n00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:45.229\nyou don't have a service minded context.\n\n380\n00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:48.794\nObviously, ITIL brings you\na service-centric context in\n\n381\n00:19:48.794 --> 00:19:53.510\nwhich you can talk about the value\nyou're presenting to the business, okay?\n\n382\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.240\nWhat about sourcing for governance?\n\n383\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:03.880\nNow what it means by this is what people\nget what responsibilities, right?\n\n384\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.500\nWhat comes into play when you talk about\nthe people aspect of governance, right?\n\n385\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.970\nThe governance body, the governance\ndomains, that we have governance over\n\n386\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.510\nfinance, governance over security,\ngovernance over human relations, right?\n\n387\n00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.690\nAre you dividing and conquering it\nthrough those types of elements?\n\n388\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:30.520\nDo you have, depending on your\nthe regime you're working under,\n\n389\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.960\nmaybe you need a regulatory\ncompliance governance?\n\n390\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.870\nAgain, if your a financial services\norganization, you're probably gonna be\n\n391\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:43.010\nheavily involved in compliance with\nfederal regulations related to finance.\n\n392\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.720\nIf you're a drug manufacturer,\n\n393\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.460\nthe FDA is gonna be knocking on your door,\noccasionally.\n\n394\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.910\nSo, you might have a compliance\nofficer for FDA relations.\n\n395\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.120\nDepending on what kind\nof business you're in.\n\n396\n00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.470\nYou could have different domains of\ngovernance you have to be concerned with.\n\n397\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.390\nSo again, sourcing them means getting\nthe right people in the right places\n\n398\n00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.983\nover the right domains to manage\nyour governance framework, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.370\nWe've talked about some of these, too.\n\n400\n00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.330\nWe have supplier management,\nthat's a governance framework for\n\n401\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.740\nmanaging your suppliers.\n\n402\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.379\nThat supplier management process is\nvery likely gonna have to deal with your\n\n403\n00:21:17.379 --> 00:21:20.137\nprocurement process, your legal process.\n\n404\n00:21:20.137 --> 00:21:24.820\nSo you have a legal domain, a procurement\ndomain, closely related but different.\n\n405\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.700\nAnd now you have supplier\nmanagement domain.\n\n406\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.250\nSo these all interrelate as it relates to\nspiral management, understanding those\n\n407\n00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:37.080\ndifferent domains is a big part of\nsetting up your governance framework.\n\n408\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.000\nITIL is effective defined\n26 governance domains,\n\n409\n00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.040\nif you will, by describing 26 processes.\n\n410\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.953\nWe need to govern change,\nwe need to govern release,\n\n411\n00:21:44.953 --> 00:21:47.387\nwe need to govern incident,\nwe need to govern problem management.\n\n412\n00:21:47.387 --> 00:21:51.969\nIn that regard, ITIL is a governance model\nin and of itself because it's divide and\n\n413\n00:21:51.969 --> 00:21:55.186\nconquered these domains of accountability,\nall right?\n\n414\n00:21:55.186 --> 00:21:58.925\nAll right, those are IT Steering Group\nwe talked about it earlier,\n\n415\n00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:03.380\nnothing really magical on this slide\nthat we didn't talk about it before.\n\n416\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.240\nIt's taking the output and I'm sorry\ntaking the input from the business and\n\n417\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.310\nturning them to directives.\n\n418\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.410\nWhere can IT go?\n\n419\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.390\nAnd again, steering is a strong term,\n\n420\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.760\nyou've got to move the big old\nship in a particular direction.\n\n421\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.720\nYou're just steering it like\na rudder moving across the ocean.\n\n422\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.320\nMoving it in the general right direction.\n\n423\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.080\nNot sudden moves, but where are we going?\n\n424\n00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.743\nOrientation, directive,\nsteering committee.\n\n425\n00:22:27.743 --> 00:22:28.517\n&gt;&gt; The tortoise, not the hare.\n\n426\n00:22:28.517 --> 00:22:30.930\n&gt;&gt; That's right, typically speaking.\n\n427\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.840\nGradual and continual improvement.\n\n428\n00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.398\nMoving forward.\n\n429\n00:22:33.398 --> 00:22:33.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n430\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.910\nthat doesn't mean that you couldn't be\nworking, again, imagine Barnes and Noble.\n\n431\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.289\nBack in the day when they were\nconsidering the advent of Amazon.com.\n\n432\n00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:45.093\nI am not sure sure how quickly they had\nto respond, but it became obvious to\n\n433\n00:22:45.093 --> 00:22:50.071\na lot of consumers anyway that Amazon\nis disrupting this business, right?\n\n434\n00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:51.898\nI think it became obvious\nto Borders books, right?\n\n435\n00:22:51.898 --> 00:22:54.394\nTheir business was disrupted I think\nthroughout that sort of thing.\n\n436\n00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:55.146\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n437\n00:22:55.146 --> 00:22:59.380\n&gt;&gt; It was a disruptive factor\nin the retailing of books.\n\n438\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.700\nBarnes and Noble is still doing business.\n\n439\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.470\nThey still got their brick and\nmortar stores.\n\n440\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.007\nThey had response to it, right?\n\n441\n00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:06.150\nHow quick that response was?\n\n442\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.270\nIt couldn't be done overnight, but\n\n443\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:11.170\nthey certainly have to\nrespond to the marketplace.\n\n444\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:16.210\nDepending on the marketplace, you might\nhave to be very, very agile, right?\n\n445\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.960\nTherefore, your steering needs\nto be a bit quicker to adjust.\n\n446\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.930\nAgain, depending on your business\nyou might work in a business area\n\n447\n00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.320\nwhere it's very slow to\nmove to different things.\n\n448\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.020\nLet's keep it steady,\n\n449\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.370\ndon't break anything, it's working,\nyou're very risk averse, right?\n\n450\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.760\nSo it's not that there's\nvarying degrees of urgency\n\n451\n00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.890\nacross the steering organizations,\nkeep that in mind, okay?\n\n452\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.717\nSo again,\n\n453\n00:23:40.717 --> 00:23:44.711\nhere's the steering group, getting a lot\nof feedback from the business units.\n\n454\n00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:49.240\nAnd feeding it into its own internal\npractices of portfolio management.\n\n455\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.580\nYou see service portfolio down\nthere in the lower right.\n\n456\n00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.418\nThat is the process that's responsible and\naccountable for evaluating\n\n457\n00:23:57.418 --> 00:24:02.263\nthe current portfolio of services and\nunderstanding the market space.\n\n458\n00:24:02.263 --> 00:24:08.361\nWhat opportunities are there available to\nus, to either find additional customers?\n\n459\n00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:11.522\nFor our existing services or\nfind existing,\n\n460\n00:24:11.522 --> 00:24:15.330\nadditional services for\nour existing customers.\n\n461\n00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.250\nLet me put that back again.\n\n462\n00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.660\nWell, IT steering group is getting general\ndirection on where they should go,\n\n463\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.080\nportfolio as in management process,\n\n464\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.690\nan IT service management process,\nis trying to discern the market space.\n\n465\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:34.590\nTheir market space is an opportunity\nto either deliver additional services\n\n466\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:39.440\nto existing customers or\nfind additional customers for\n\n467\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.460\nexisting services, that's what portfolio\nmanagements trying to get done, right?\n\n468\n00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.300\nAs a strategic asset,\nservice portfolio management\n\n469\n00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.470\nis right there next to the IT steering\ngroup in terms of governance.\n\n470\n00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.180\nOkay.\n\n471\n00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.618\nDoing so in a methodical way.\n\n472\n00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:56.710\nOf course,\ngovernance in change management.\n\n473\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.340\nWho gets to approve what kind of change?\n\n474\n00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.149\nWhen is that approval provided?\n\n475\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.790\nWhat criteria is used to grant\napproval for authorization?\n\n476\n00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.210\nThat's part of governance\nwithin change management.\n\n477\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.600\nChange management happens to be divided\nup among the release management\n\n478\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.820\nsteps if you will, or phases.\n\n479\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:25.390\nThe approval of the planning stage,\nthe approval of the build and test phase,\n\n480\n00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.970\nthe approvement of the deployment\nstage and review and closure.\n\n481\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.620\nSo there's various phases in\nrelease at a point in management\n\n482\n00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.510\nthat change management is overseeing and\nauthorizing.\n\n483\n00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.050\nThat is governance.\n\n484\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.680\nYou have a different group of people\nthat says yes, you may proceed.\n\n485\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.510\nAnother form of governance\nrelated to change management\n\n486\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.950\nis the separation of duties.\n\n487\n00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.750\nAgain, something that Zach pointed out\nearlier where you have, you define and\n\n488\n00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.790\ndelegate appropriately.\n\n489\n00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.550\nThat's where the accountabilities come as\nrelates to change management, that could\n\n490\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:00.070\nbe the separation of the person that\nbuilds it from the person that tests it.\n\n491\n00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.170\nAs a general principle, you don't have\nthe same person building something and\n\n492\n00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.730\nalso testing it.\n\n493\n00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.870\nYou don't have them test\nthe thing they built.\n\n494\n00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.110\nYou build it, someone else tests it.\n\n495\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.700\nThat's like having someone\nproofread your paper, right?\n\n496\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.470\nIt's best if you have someone else do\nthe proofreading because you'll just glide\n\n497\n00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.420\nright over the same mistake you\nmade every time you read it.\n\n498\n00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.120\nAnd the person proofreading will find,\nyou missed a comma there.\n\n499\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.540\nYou used of twice, etc.\n\n500\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Good analogy.\n\n501\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.800\n&gt;&gt; So that's a general\nprinciple of being able to\n\n502\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.700\ndelegate authorities in an appropriate\nway for governance, right?\n\n503\n00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.320\nChange management is rife with them and\nmany other ones.\n\n504\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.960\nYou have this idea of\na Change Advisory Board\n\n505\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.770\nthat gets together to\napprove these various phases.\n\n506\n00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:47.592\nIn the build and test deployment regime.\n\n507\n00:26:47.592 --> 00:26:52.580\nYou perhaps have a separate authority, the\nEmergency Change Advisory Board the ECAB\n\n508\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.060\nthat gets together just to\nfocus on Emergency CAB changes.\n\n509\n00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.900\nWhich could have different\nmembership altogether.\n\n510\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.120\nSimilar membership, but\ndifferent membership.\n\n511\n00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.270\nThat group of people that gets\ntogether to approve change.\n\n512\n00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.830\nOkay?\nNow this whole idea of holistically\n\n513\n00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.930\nlooking at service management as a system.\n\n514\n00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.830\nRight?\nService management systems or again,\n\n515\n00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.210\nusing the word system in\na more classic sense.\n\n516\n00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.730\nA lot of things moving\ntogether toward a common goal\n\n517\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.910\nas opposed to something you go and\nbuy, right?\n\n518\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.250\nI think I'll go buy me\na service management system,\n\n519\n00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.710\nit's probably gonna be lots\nof moving parts, right?\n\n520\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.510\nDisparate parts that's going\nto be federated together\n\n521\n00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.560\nin a meaningful way, right?\n\n522\n00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:41.350\nSo a tool set that's called service\nmanagement system can help you.\n\n523\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.960\n&gt;&gt; Direct and\n\n524\n00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.920\ncontrol some of the governance\nactivities you need to go, right?\n\n525\n00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.500\nSo as an example in change management,\nyou could build in the workflow for\n\n526\n00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.710\nwho can request it and\nwho can approve it, right?\n\n527\n00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:58.780\nSo if I am registered as an approver of\nchanges, then when it gets to that part of\n\n528\n00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.780\nthe workflow, I'm able to go in there and\nclick the lever that says, yes, I approve.\n\n529\n00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.380\nIf I don't have that permission,\n\n530\n00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.500\nif I don't have that role, I'm not able\nto click that lever to say it's approved.\n\n531\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.360\nSo you can kinda build in governance even\nwithin your tool sets which is a great\n\n532\n00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.660\ntrick to have.\n\n533\n00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.310\nIf you can pull that one off,\nit's awesome.\n\n534\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.530\nAll right.\n\n535\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.390\nQuality as a means of\nGovernance is pretty darn cool.\n\n536\n00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.050\nRight?\n\n537\n00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:31.540\nIf you're promising deliver at 99.9% and\nyou are only delivering\n\n538\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.150\nat 96%,\nyou are governing some behaviors there.\n\n539\n00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.490\nYou are pointing out very transparently,\nyou are not meeting the grade.\n\n540\n00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.070\nRight?\n\n541\n00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.830\nSo it's a way, again, to keep people\nmotivated in the right direction\n\n542\n00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.170\nto govern the way they\nare going to behave.\n\n543\n00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.180\nMeasurement itself in\nthe improvement cycle itself\n\n544\n00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.240\nis a means of governance, right?\n\n545\n00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.920\nSo quality governance can be done\nthrough this constant cycle of\n\n546\n00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.970\ncontinual improvement.\n\n547\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.390\nAnd that's what's shown here, the Deming\ncycle, the plan, do, check, act.\n\n548\n00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.740\nAs relates to governance,\nthat's what you're doing.\n\n549\n00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.350\nYou're planning for appropriate behavior.\n\n550\n00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.740\nPeople behave.\n\n551\n00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.430\nYou check on their behavior.\n\n552\n00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.010\nIf it's good, great.\n\n553\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.130\nIf it's not, you act, right.\n\n554\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.220\nSo, even as it relates to governments,\nthe plan do check\n\n555\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.380\nact cycle otherwise known as\nthe Deming cycle is a key motivator,\n\n556\n00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.410\na key methodology, if you will,\njust to make sure you're going right.\n\n557\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:33.010\nAgain, consider again acceptable use\npolicy for people using a laptop.\n\n558\n00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.120\nDepending on the organization,\nmaybe you can't have a thumb drive.\n\n559\n00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.420\nSo acceptable use policy is don't\nbring your thumb drive to work.\n\n560\n00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.750\nDon't even put a thumb\ndrive in that USB port.\n\n561\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.430\nDon't even do it.\n\n562\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.030\nAlright.\n\n563\n00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.540\nOther company's are a bit more lax.\n\n564\n00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.580\nRight.\nYou can do that.\n\n565\n00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.150\nThat's governance behavior.\n\n566\n00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.010\nNow how would you monitor that behavior?\n\n567\n00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.540\nWell maybe you'd do it electronically.\n\n568\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.190\nMaybe its scouts honor.\n\n569\n00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.720\nMaybe you'd search people with\na wand when they come in.\n\n570\n00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.560\nThey have USB drive you'd confiscate it,\nand they'd lose it.\n\n571\n00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.500\nAgain, you see the behaviors\nhere are advertised.\n\n572\n00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.250\nThey are monitored, and\n\n573\n00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.870\nperhaps consequences in that\nparticular cycle of work.\n\n574\n00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:17.285\n&gt;&gt; I had a manager once, he used to say\nall the time, under promise, over deliver.\n\n575\n00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:19.486\nOver-promise, under-deliver.\n\n576\n00:30:19.486 --> 00:30:22.140\nUnder-promise, then over-deliver.\n\n577\n00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\nGood points.\n\n578\n00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.168\n&gt;&gt; How do you react to that?\n\n579\n00:30:24.168 --> 00:30:26.864\n&gt;&gt; Under-promise, over-deliver.\n\n580\n00:30:26.864 --> 00:30:28.900\nYeah, I understand that tactic.\n\n581\n00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.070\nI do.\nI appreciate that.\n\n582\n00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.640\nI think it's often so\n\n583\n00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.460\ndangerous to do it the other way,\nwhere you over promised and under deliver.\n\n584\n00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.260\nBecause that's so slippery of a slope and\n\n585\n00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.360\nso disappointing, your expectations\nare high, the approvals are low.\n\n586\n00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.570\nThat there's so\nmuch danger in over promising\n\n587\n00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:51.700\nthat I would go to the other side of that\nball myself, under promise a little bit.\n\n588\n00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.190\nIn the optimum, straight up world,\nyou always predict where you're going and\n\n589\n00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.480\nyou deliver just as you promised.\n\n590\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.030\nThat's the best place to move.\n\n591\n00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.660\nI think if you under promise and\n\n592\n00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.090\nover deliver, that's awesome in\nterms of expectation management.\n\n593\n00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.438\nBut they could also get used to that.\n\n594\n00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:08.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, Mm-hm, Mm-hm.\n\n595\n00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nAnd they realize,\n\n596\n00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.860\nwell that's what you do every time.\n\n597\n00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.020\nSo then they start squeezing you even\nmore the next requirements round.\n\n598\n00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess.\n&gt;&gt; I guess there's a payoff either\n\n599\n00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.260\nway you go.\n\n600\n00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is.\n\n601\n00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.450\n&gt;&gt; I think in the perfect world,\nyou're just completely transparent and\n\n602\n00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.390\ncompletely aware of what\nyou're capable of doing.\n\n603\n00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:22.980\nRight?\n\n604\n00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.840\nAnd you're willing to adjust if those\ncapabilities are falling short and\n\n605\n00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.650\nyou're transparent about falling short.\n\n606\n00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.740\nSo I think an honest approach.\n\n607\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.704\nI think generally speaking, and\ncertainly preaches this as well,\n\n608\n00:31:35.704 --> 00:31:41.120\nthat being transparent Is in of\nitself in improvement, right?\n\n609\n00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.990\nBeing transparent in another\nword you are not afraid to show\n\n610\n00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.820\nthat we are monitoring ourselves and\nby the way we fell short this month.\n\n611\n00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.900\nWe are only at 96%, you wouldn't have even\nknown that customer if we hadn't told you,\n\n612\n00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.470\nso that's building trust even integrity.\n\n613\n00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.500\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's integrity.\n\n614\n00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.180\nYou're building trust and integrity just\nby being transparent about it, right?\n\n615\n00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.340\nSo I think in the end, I think in the end\nwhat you'll wanna do is be as clearly\n\n616\n00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.050\narticulate as you can be\nabout your capabilities and\n\n617\n00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.240\nwhat you want to deliver and what\nthe constraints are for delivering that.\n\n618\n00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.850\nIdentify the risks.\n\n619\n00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.220\nDo that transparently and\nwhen you get there and\n\n620\n00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.460\nyou have fallen short of the goals, be\ntransparent about that, fallen or short,\n\n621\n00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.140\nsay yup we're gonna try and\ndo more better.\n\n622\n00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.600\nAnd therefore building the integrity,\nbuilding the trust and\n\n623\n00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.320\nhave an ongoing relationship\nis probably better.\n\n624\n00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.210\nSo that's a whole lot about governance,\nI'll get a little piece\n\n625\n00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.360\nabout some organizational structures\nto help with this governance but\n\n626\n00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.640\nwe need to take that\nup in another episode.\n\n627\n00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.300\nTerry, once again, fantastic, so\nmuch information and it's great.\n\n628\n00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.890\nAnd this is ITIL MALC,\ngovernance across the life cycle.\n\n629\n00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:45.140\nMake sure you watch it as many times as\nyou need to, repetition's good for you.\n\n630\n00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.530\nAnd also there's all kinds of\ncontent in the ITIL MALC series.\n\n631\n00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.370\nWatch them all, you'll be glad you did.\n\n632\n00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.870\nAnd thank you for\nwatching ITProTV

00:00:08.462\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:12.160\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.260\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for choosing\nITProTV helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.680\nI'm your host Zach Memos\nas we continue on.\n\n7\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.440\nWith ITIL Malc and this is gonna be\norganization across the lifecycle and\n\n8\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.180\nwe're gonna learn more about that from\nMr Terry Decker, who's right here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.905\nGood, good guy.\n\n10\n00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you very much Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.590\nHappy to be here as always,\nappreciate the enthusiasm and\n\n12\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.165\nendorsement of my expert credentials here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:39.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Looking at\n\n14\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.320\norganization across the lifecycle.\n\n15\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030\nFirst of all, to set the stage here,\nITIL is not a best practice for\n\n16\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.870\norganizational development.\n\n17\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.500\nOkay, now that said, organization\ndevelopment could play a very key\n\n18\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.810\nsuccess factor in your adopting and\n\n19\n00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.790\nimplementing IT service management\ncapabilities across your organization.\n\n20\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.120\nWe need to look at it.\n\n21\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.850\nIt's not that ITIL is telling you, you\nmust organize your organization this way.\n\n22\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.690\nOr here's the best practice for\nhow to set up your organization.\n\n23\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.330\nOrganizations vary in size,\ncomplexity all the time.\n\n24\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.550\nSo ITIL really couldn't get\ninto under the hood in details\n\n25\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.870\nof organizational structure.\n\n26\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.040\nSo we're gonna keep it\nto 5,000 foot view and\n\n27\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.230\nhave a look at organizational\nstructures and\n\n28\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.240\nhow they could impact, either positively\nor negatively, your implementation\n\n29\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.420\nof IT service management across\nthe organization or across the life cycle.\n\n30\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.030\nSo let's have a look.\n\n31\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.510\nI want to focus on these\nbullets a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.980\nI tend not to read the bullets, but\n\n33\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.240\nthere's some really good\nones here worth focusing on.\n\n34\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.390\nThis first one, adoption of service\nmanagement to service delivery.\n\n35\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.050\nSo adopting a service management approach\ninstead of a solutions design approach,\n\n36\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.480\nor a system delivery approach.\n\n37\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.140\nDesigning a service management approach\n\n38\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.630\nto service delivery could mean\na new vision for your organization.\n\n39\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.160\nAll right,\nlet me put this a different way.\n\n40\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.180\nAre you practicing ITIL now\nanywhere in your organization?\n\n41\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240\nIs it just an idea in someone's head?\n\n42\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.495\nThey think it might be a good idea.\n\n43\n00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:07.860\nRight, depending where you are on this\ndevelopment model or this maturity model\n\n44\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.840\ntoward IT service management,\nyou might be at the very beginning.\n\n45\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.850\nAnd if you're at the very beginning,\nthen obviously it's a sea change, right.\n\n46\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.000\nIt's a big change to move toward the\nadoption of a service management approach.\n\n47\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.470\nIf it is a sea change or a new vision,\nyou're probably gonna get some\n\n48\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.720\nresistance, or it's gonna require\nsome organizational change.\n\n49\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.510\nYou got to reorient people towards the new\nbehaviors that you're trying to do.\n\n50\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.200\nRelated to governess which we just\ntalked about in the previous episode is\n\n51\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.130\nthis organizational aspect of getting\nthe right people in the right roles.\n\n52\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.240\nAnd putting them in the right amount\nof tension with each other and\n\n53\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.790\nby tension I mean positive tension.\n\n54\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.860\nThey work well against each other.\n\n55\n00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.420\nThey work well with each other, right.\n\n56\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.820\nHave change management,\nrelease management built.\n\n57\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.120\nHave incident and problem.\n\n58\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.330\nThey work with each other and\nthey have tension between each other.\n\n59\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.640\nIt's a positive tension, a right kind\nof friction between them, right?\n\n60\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.950\nSo the introduction of IT service\nmanagement is necessarily introduction\n\n61\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.530\nof new processes.\n\n62\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.410\nThe introduction, the processes is\nnecessarily a change in behavior,\n\n63\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.280\npeople are gonna have to\nfollow the processes, right?\n\n64\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.490\nSo in that going to the bullets,\nhigh performance organizations.\n\n65\n00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.330\nThis is a blanket statement,\na very generic statement.\n\n66\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.580\nHigh performance organizations tend to\ndrift toward decentralized management.\n\n67\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.200\nWhat they're trying to say there is that\nample sampling of delegation of authority.\n\n68\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.510\nAllowing the right people to make\nthe right decision at the right level\n\n69\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.630\ntends to be a more high\nperforming organization.\n\n70\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.290\nI believe it's called right the ship.\n\n71\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.270\nA Navy commander of a nuclear\nsubmarine wrote a book and\n\n72\n00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.520\nhis approach, and you might think\nthe Navy very hierarchical.\n\n73\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.430\nThe commander says jump,\neveryone says how high, right?\n\n74\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.260\nThat's the typical way maybe\na stereotypical way to consider\n\n75\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.020\na military regime, if you will or and\nobviously there is a top down command\n\n76\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.400\nstructure where it does flow downstream\nwhen the orders are passed down.\n\n77\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.070\nBut what this commander did even\nwithin that structure of hierarchy,\n\n78\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.400\nhe delegated a lot of\nauthority throughout the ship.\n\n79\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.770\nAnd expected people to be able to think\non their feet in certain situations, and\n\n80\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.590\nhe authorized them to think on\ntheir feet in certain situations.\n\n81\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.060\nSo he gave the rules of engagement and\nallow them to be decisive, right?\n\n82\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.410\nSo how empowering is that?\n\n83\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.810\nThe user or\nthe person I should say the user,\n\n84\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.550\nthe person feels like they have\nmore at stake in this game.\n\n85\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.600\nThey feel like they're valued more.\n\n86\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.850\nThey're part of the solution,\nnot just being, not just following orders.\n\n87\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.420\nNow again, this commander didn't\nbreak down the command structure.\n\n88\n00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.230\nHe just opened it up in a way,\n\n89\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.340\nwhere authority was given\nat the appropriate levels.\n\n90\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.710\nAnd over and over again,\nin the various exercises they had,\n\n91\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.120\nin competitions with other\nsubmarine commanders and whatnot.\n\n92\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.720\nThey continually outperformed\neveryone in the Navy, right?\n\n93\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.030\nSo just an example, again,\nnot one that ITIL cites.\n\n94\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.690\nBut this idea that a high performance\norganization tends to be one\n\n95\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.080\nthat decentralizes the authority matrix,\nright?\n\n96\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.850\nIt's not all just top-driven and down.\n\n97\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.290\nSo it resonates with me.\n\n98\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.520\nI know I work in those\nenvironments more effectively\n\n99\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.340\nthan I do in the top-down approach.\n\n100\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.690\nAgain, you're not destroying\nthe structure of hierarchy,\n\n101\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.880\nyou're just expanding the authority matrix\nin a way to make it more effective and\n\n102\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.210\nget more buy-in and more, and actually,\nbetter performance on the ground.\n\n103\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Delegation of duties\nto the right people.\n\n104\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n105\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.550\nThe following, as we look at this\nfollowing slide we're gonna look at\n\n106\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.750\nsome of these organizational\ndynamics that could play out.\n\n107\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.920\nAgain, I don't want even now I don't want\nto think that this is stage of evolution.\n\n108\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.080\nThat you're a better organization if\nyou get to the top, cuz different\n\n109\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.280\norganizations operate in different ways\nand ITIL is certainly not saying that\n\n110\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.580\neither that you must evolve toward\nservice through collaboration, right.\n\n111\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.300\nThey're not saying that, directly.\n\n112\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.220\nThey're suggesting it.\n\n113\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.220\nAnd highly suggestive that,\nthe more decentralized you are,\n\n114\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.160\npotentially the higher\nperforming you will become.\n\n115\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.000\nAgain, not prescribing.\n\n116\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000\nBut as you're looking on the exam,\nI think if you look on the exam.\n\n117\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.749\nYou're gonna find instances\nwhere this dysfunction of\n\n118\n00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.440\nhaving not enough control,\nis causing problems.\n\n119\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.950\nAnd then the dysfunction of\nhaving too much control and\n\n120\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.130\nnot delegating enough is causing problems.\n\n121\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.150\nSo try to find another way out of it.\n\n122\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.710\nSo it's not that one is right,\nor one is wrong.\n\n123\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.800\nIt's just, if you're struggling with one,\nit may be time to move toward another.\n\n124\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.710\nAnd notice this dichotomy,\nI'm gonna stay here for a bit.\n\n125\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.580\nWhat you get on services through network.\n\n126\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.360\nAnd we'll look at these\nindividually in a minute.\n\n127\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.410\nBut services through network just\nsimply means, we all kinda get along.\n\n128\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.960\nThere's no real delegation of authority.\n\n129\n00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.385\nI got some stake in the game,\nZach's got some stake in the game.\n\n130\n00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.345\nHe works on some things.\n\n131\n00:07:00.345 --> 00:07:04.815\nI work on some things and we might get\nto the same conclusions, we might not.\n\n132\n00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:07.975\nWe might deliver toward the same goals,\nwe might not.\n\n133\n00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:10.745\nWhat's really pretty good about that\n\n134\n00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:13.935\nis that we could have very\ncreative opportunities, right.\n\n135\n00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:16.795\nWe can be very spontaneous\nin where we're going.\n\n136\n00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:18.310\nThat could be a good thing.\n\n137\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.500\nBut what you're lacking there,\npotentially, as this graphic shows,\n\n138\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.890\nif you're just servicing through\na network, I do a little bit,\n\n139\n00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.260\nyou do a network, you're kinda\nlosing this challenge of leadership.\n\n140\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.375\nYou have no direction to move toward,\nno common goal necessary,\n\n141\n00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:36.555\npotentially necessary to move you\ntoward the right kind of success.\n\n142\n00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:38.865\nSo then, you fix that.\n\n143\n00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:40.890\nLack of leadership,\nwith lack of direction.\n\n144\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.075\nZach, you do these six things.\n\n145\n00:07:43.075 --> 00:07:45.005\nTerry, you do these 23 things.\n\n146\n00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:46.745\nI think that's the right balance, right?\n\n147\n00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:49.020\n&gt;&gt; That's a good balance.\n\n148\n00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.180\nYou know, you just point to people and\ndo do do, do do do, right?\n\n149\n00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.570\nNow you're very directive.\n\n150\n00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.357\nYou're telling people what to do.\n\n151\n00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:58.381\nOne of the challenges of that, well you're\ncertainly taking care of the leadership\n\n152\n00:07:58.381 --> 00:07:59.753\nthing, because you're leading it.\n\n153\n00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:01.842\nYou're telling everyone what to do, but\n\n154\n00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:04.660\nwhat you're losing there is autonomy,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.510\nAnd the value of autonomy is\nthe creative thinking aspects, so\n\n156\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.440\nI'm kind of squashing my even\nsense of being creative.\n\n157\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.020\nBecause if you tell me what to do,\nI won't even ask anymore, right?\n\n158\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.270\nI've had situations like that,\ntraveling through different bosses in\n\n159\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.480\nthe organization where one\nwas highly directive, right?\n\n160\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.400\nAnd I was used to one that\ngave me lots of autonomy.\n\n161\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.700\nAnd coming from an autonomous\noperation to a directive one,\n\n162\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.900\nwow where do we misconnect, right?\n\n163\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.980\nShe gave me a directive,\nI did something, right?\n\n164\n00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.520\nThe other one gave me a directive,\nI did something.\n\n165\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.950\nI kinda created my own response to it.\n\n166\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.530\nI gave the response to one,\nthat's a pretty good job, Terry, nice job.\n\n167\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.210\nGave my response to the other one,\nI didn't tell you to do that,\n\n168\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.730\nI told you to do this.\n\n169\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.900\nI didn't ask you for\nyour opinion do, do, do, right?\n\n170\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.130\nDifferences right?\n\n171\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.430\nSo you got the leadership part but\nyour losing the autonomy part.\n\n172\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.040\nSo now you go through delegation and\n\n173\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.300\nthis is what Zach pointed to when we were\ntalking about governance a long time ago.\n\n174\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.320\nDelegate it.\n\n175\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.440\nI'm not telling you what to do, but\nhere's what your responsible for.\n\n176\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:12.095\nBy the end of the quarter,\nI want you to have done x, go, right?\n\n177\n00:09:12.095 --> 00:09:16.950\nZach, by the end of the quarter I want\nyou to do y, so Zach goes off and does y.\n\n178\n00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.630\nI'm giving him direction.\n\n179\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.150\nI want you to accomplish x.\n\n180\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.430\nI want you to accomplish y.\n\n181\n00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.750\nSo the direction is there without\nthe subjugation of autonomy,\n\n182\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.540\nallowing me to think, okay,\nhow I'm gonna get there,\n\n183\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.320\nwhat am I gonna do, who do I need to\ninvolve, what stake I'm gonna manage.\n\n184\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.630\nObviously that involves a lot of trust,\nright.\n\n185\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.070\nThe person making this assignment\nneeds to trust that I can get to\n\n186\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.830\nthat particular location\non time on budget etc.\n\n187\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.690\nThey need to trust Zach\nto get there as well.\n\n188\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.290\nRight, so there's some trust in there.\n\n189\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.940\nBut my autonomy is regained, right.\n\n190\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.680\nBut then now you could be\nlosing some control, right.\n\n191\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.050\nWhat if I don't deliver them on time?\n\n192\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.820\nThey said square and\nI kind of built a rectangle, right.\n\n193\n00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.240\nZach's over there with an ellipse\ninstead of a circle, right?\n\n194\n00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.290\nWe didn't quite build it\nexactly what they said, so\n\n195\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.830\nnow we're losing some of the control.\n\n196\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.800\nSo how do you get that\ncontrol back is the thing.\n\n197\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.950\nSo now it's coordination.\n\n198\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.882\nNow you're getting to this evolution,\nwell I'm gonna give you what you need.\n\n199\n00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:19.520\nI'm gonna give you enough rope,\nyou can go fashion the perfect bridge and\n\n200\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.440\nthen go hang yourself from it perhaps.\n\n201\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.170\nHere's your own,\nwe'll give you enough rope.\n\n202\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.210\n&gt;&gt; My mother used to\nsay that all the time.\n\n203\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.380\n&gt;&gt; Bridge and the hang yourself,\nyeah, totally get it.\n\n204\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.430\nSo, I'm going to give you enough rope.\n\n205\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.480\nAgain, I like to put\nthe constructive part in.\n\n206\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.110\nYou can go out and\n\n207\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.210\nbuild the perfect bridge with this rope,\nright, instead of just go hang yourself.\n\n208\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.830\nBut, coordination now.\n\n209\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.910\nAll right, so I got the rope.\n\n210\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.180\nZach's got some rope.\n\n211\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.480\nWe gotta build a bridge and we gotta\nkeep people from hanging themselves.\n\n212\n00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.640\nSo, now we're starting to\ncoordinate our activities and\n\n213\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.130\nwe know what the bridge\nis supposed to look like.\n\n214\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.320\nWe know it has to be a bridge right?\n\n215\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.460\nIt's nothing but a bridge.\n\n216\n00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.320\nWe gotta build a bridge.\n\n217\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.356\nThey didn't tell us,\n\n218\n00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:57.959\nIf you use the general dimensions of the\nbridge how long it has to be, what it's\n\n219\n00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:02.110\ngot to span, but how we fasten out\nthe rope we got is still up to us, right.\n\n220\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.400\nSo, now you are getting coordination,\nthe direction is kinda back,\n\n221\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.850\nthe overall action goes is kinda back,\nright?\n\n222\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.210\nWe got that back in the house,\nright, and then, but\n\n223\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.250\nthen you got the challenge of bureaucracy.\n\n224\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.120\nYou've introduced a bunch of processes.\n\n225\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.960\nCoordination, okay.\n\n226\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.650\nBefore I move on to\nsection two of the bridge,\n\n227\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.660\nI got to make sure Zach signs off on\nit because his sign off on section two\n\n228\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.910\nallows me to build section three\nwhile he's building section four.\n\n229\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.640\nSo we got to get this right.\n\n230\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.153\nSo all of a sudden because my gosh,\nbureaucracy!\n\n231\n00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:34.943\nEveryone'll be crying against bureaucracy,\nright?\n\n232\n00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:40.880\nSo how do we limit bureaucracy, now we're\ngetting to the world of collaboration.\n\n233\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.170\nVery close to coordination right?\n\n234\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.850\nBut with the added effect of\nwe're all in this together.\n\n235\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.050\nSo I'm not just waiting for Zach.\n\n236\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.500\nI'm going over there to help\nhim finish his part two\n\n237\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.260\nwhile he helps me finish my part three.\n\n238\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.200\nGetting this collaboration affect going.\n\n239\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.690\nWe're empowered to do it.\n\n240\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.200\nNow we're collaborating together.\n\n241\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.410\nThe stakes are similar, not identical and\n\n242\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.830\nyet we can help each other\nget this thing done.\n\n243\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.320\nSo again, moving up this,\nI'll call it evolution, but\n\n244\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.860\nreally, you can be at any stage any time,\nat different parts of the organization.\n\n245\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.530\nThey have limitations.\n\n246\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.100\nThey have advantages.\n\n247\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.599\nLet's take a look at these\nas we go through them.\n\n248\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.580\nThe development stage.\n\n249\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.802\nOrganizational development if you're at\nstage one, again, I don't want you to\n\n250\n00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:27.430\nthink I want total counter the,\nit's kind of counter intuitive.\n\n251\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:33.220\nStage one up to stage five suggests that\nwe're moving toward the nirvana right?\n\n252\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.480\nWe're getting better up here.\n\n253\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.080\nI want to forestall that\nmentality as you consider this.\n\n254\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.250\nStage one could be the perfect stage for\nany given part of the organization,\n\n255\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.120\nwhere you do want to have\na lot of independent thinking,\n\n256\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.350\nworking on maybe a software development\nshops need that type of environment,\n\n257\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.980\nwhere it really is a network environment,\nwhere it says just be creative.\n\n258\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.000\nIf you wanna stop developing for a while\nand start writing code and wanna play\n\n259\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.660\na few pinball games and have another cup\nof coffee, then just go over there, right?\n\n260\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.550\nYou don't even have to come in\nat 7 o'clock in the morning if\n\n261\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.470\nyou don't want to.\n\n262\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.100\nCome in at ten, right?\n\n263\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.970\nBut we expect that there's gonna be some\nsort of deliverable at some point, right?\n\n264\n00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.980\nGo be creative.\n\n265\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.570\nSo this could be an effective tool,\nan effective organizational model.\n\n266\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.440\nNow I'm suggesting that ITIL would\nnot like this one a whole lot,\n\n267\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.710\nbecause ITIL wants to\nintroduce some controls.\n\n268\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.340\nWants to introduce some collaborative\nopportunities and governance, right?\n\n269\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.090\nSo as an ITIL service\nmanagement discipline,\n\n270\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.610\nyou're probably going to evolve quickly\naway from this type of environment,\n\n271\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.150\nbecause you necessarily need\nto get people corralled,\n\n272\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.898\nif you will, toward common\nstandard deliverables, right.\n\n273\n00:13:43.898 --> 00:13:47.500\nSo you're gonna be changing this\nkind of dynamic a little bit, right.\n\n274\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.850\nAs you move up the stages to the idea\nof services through direction.\n\n275\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.210\nYou want to, sure you want to govern\npeople, but this top down approach can be\n\n276\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.740\nvery stifling to creativity and\nvery stifling, even to attitudes.\n\n277\n00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.260\nYou don't creative thinking.\n\n278\n00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.990\nYou don't get wise people\nmaking suggestions.\n\n279\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.420\nWell, my boss just told me to do it.\n\n280\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.000\nI think it's stupid, but I'm gonna\ndo it anyway, that sort of thing.\n\n281\n00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.280\nThat's one of the downfalls\nof the directive approach,\n\n282\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.640\nis that you're stifling creativity.\n\n283\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.650\nAnd you're stifling, potentially,\nthe good attitudes of good, wise people.\n\n284\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.600\nYou could have a lot of burnout here,\nright?\n\n285\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.970\nA lot of people say well I don't\nwanna work here anymore, it's no fun.\n\n286\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:33.490\nI'm just told what to do, they don't\nvalue for me my opinion, etc, right?\n\n287\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.490\nThat sort of thing.\n\n288\n00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.710\n&gt;&gt; I have experienced that.\n\n289\n00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, and I think most people's\nwork experience you've come across it,\n\n290\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.980\nif you've ever had to be under the thumb\nof it, you've certainly witnessed it and\n\n291\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.156\nI've been under the thumb of\nsome of these things as well.\n\n292\n00:14:45.156 --> 00:14:49.200\nJust told what to do and well,\nhey this is not me, right?\n\n293\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.880\nAnd there was a lot of turnover.\n\n294\n00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.040\nI mean, just depends on the industry and\nwhat you're working with.\n\n295\n00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.840\nIT service management doesn't\nwant to tolerate a whole lot of\n\n296\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.780\ncowboy network,\njust go do what you wanna do.\n\n297\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.060\nIT services management discipline\nas the word suggests discipline,\n\n298\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.020\nis more disciplined and\ncontrolled, it's intended to be.\n\n299\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.190\nSo if you look at services\nthrough delegation,\n\n300\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.380\nnow this is giving someone some autonomy.\n\n301\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.955\nGo get this done like the example I\nmentioned earlier, Terry you go do x,\n\n302\n00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:21.520\nZach you go do y.\n\n303\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.583\nWe're not told what steps\nare involved in there.\n\n304\n00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:25.662\nWe have that level of freedom.\n\n305\n00:15:25.662 --> 00:15:28.558\nI want you to have y done\nby the end of the quarter,\n\n306\n00:15:28.558 --> 00:15:33.450\nyou have x done by the end of the quarter,\nwe'll watch in that direction, right?\n\n307\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.840\nSo this does provide room for innovation.\n\n308\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.540\nIt does give some controls.\n\n309\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.070\nIt does make people accountable, right?\n\n310\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.461\nSo, as your looking at the IT\nservice management methodology,\n\n311\n00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:47.750\non the exam or back at the office.\n\n312\n00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.537\nYou probably wanna be approaching\nthis one sooner than later,\n\n313\n00:15:51.537 --> 00:15:54.090\nwhere you're assigning ownership.\n\n314\n00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.009\nWe're not sure what the change management\nprocess is supposed to look like.\n\n315\n00:15:57.009 --> 00:15:59.046\nBut you'll get that done\nwithin this quarter.\n\n316\n00:15:59.046 --> 00:16:04.004\nManage the stakeholders as best as you\ncan, and come up with a operating process\n\n317\n00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:09.000\nthat we can begin to review, not\nimplement, that we can begin to review.\n\n318\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.870\nMake that happen, right?\n\n319\n00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.780\nThat's assigning ownership and\naccountability.\n\n320\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.670\nDelegation is a great place to begin when\nyou consider IT Service Management, right?\n\n321\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.494\nA great place to begin.\n\n322\n00:16:18.494 --> 00:16:21.792\nNow, obviously, there's gonna have to be\nsome interactions among these different\n\n323\n00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:22.345\nprocesses.\n\n324\n00:16:22.345 --> 00:16:26.900\nSo, moving up the chain, if you will,\nto this idea of co-ordination.\n\n325\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.850\nWhere I'm developing this imaginative\nprocess, Zack is implementing, or\n\n326\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.147\ngoing to be bringing the problem\nmanagement process together.\n\n327\n00:16:34.147 --> 00:16:36.980\nNow, we have to co-operate\nwith each other.\n\n328\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.190\nI get mad at Zack because his problem\nmanagement process is not syncing up with\n\n329\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.190\nmine very well.\n\n330\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.970\nThe tool set is kinda cloggy.\n\n331\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.460\nI can't share my incident information\nwith his problem formation tool.\n\n332\n00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.531\nDang it.\n\n333\n00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:49.379\nOkay, never mind, Zack,\nI'm gonna stick with me,\n\n334\n00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:51.202\nI'm gonna go with my incident management,\nright?\n\n335\n00:16:51.202 --> 00:16:55.867\nThat's getting back to the delegation part\nand not so much the collaboration piece,\n\n336\n00:16:55.867 --> 00:16:58.216\ntrying to work toward those common goals.\n\n337\n00:16:58.216 --> 00:17:02.215\nSo again, as an entry point for\nadopting IT Service Management,\n\n338\n00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:07.089\nyou're probably gonna have to have a level\nof organizational development that\n\n339\n00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:12.490\nat least supports, as I go back one,\nthe service through delegation, right?\n\n340\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:17.140\nHopefully you're going to quickly evolve\ntoward this idea of collaboration\n\n341\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.720\namong the different people,\nthe different stakeholders, right?\n\n342\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.230\nAnd hopefully eventually\nget there where you have\n\n343\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.300\ncollaboration across the entire\norganization, right?\n\n344\n00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.080\nAnd, beautiful picture here,\ncross-functional, look, everything's\n\n345\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.340\ngreen, everything's nice, everyone's\nlined up nice and pretty, right?\n\n346\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.720\nWe've got our silos, right?\n\n347\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.490\nBut we got all the interfaces\nbuilt between the silos.\n\n348\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.830\nThey are all well oiled.\n\n349\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.700\nIt's perfect, right?\n\n350\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.455\nThis is the ITIL layout.\n\n351\n00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:46.765\n[CROSSTALK] Where we would like to go,\nall right?\n\n352\n00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:51.730\nSo, you remember the functions\nwe talked about?\n\n353\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:57.020\nFunctions, we had service desk as\na function, we had technical management,\n\n354\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.498\napplication management, and IT operations\nmanagement as the four primary functions.\n\n355\n00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:07.080\nAnd we described the functions as a group\nof people with special skills and tools.\n\n356\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.908\nAnd as I described functions, I also said,\n\n357\n00:18:09.908 --> 00:18:14.504\nremember ITIL is not an organizational\ndesign best practice, right?\n\n358\n00:18:14.504 --> 00:18:18.498\nThey're not, but they have described that\nyou need these four skill sets working in\n\n359\n00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:20.000\nyour organization.\n\n360\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.560\nThese are the kind of people you need.\n\n361\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.099\nNow, let's say you work in\na real small organization.\n\n362\n00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:28.090\nMaybe you are a person that\nexists in all four functions.\n\n363\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.610\nYou are the help desk technician.\n\n364\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.540\nYou are the technical manager that knows\neverything there is to know about all\n\n365\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.900\nthe servers in your environment.\n\n366\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.350\nYou are also the application manager,\n\n367\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.150\nknows everything about\nthe application your business uses.\n\n368\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.070\nAnd you manage the backups and\nrestores for these things everyday.\n\n369\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.040\n&gt;&gt; Many hats.\n\n370\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Many hats.\n\n371\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.870\nSo you, okay, so\nyou maybe only wear two of those hats and\n\n372\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.890\nyou have you know an IT\ndepartment of 15 people, right?\n\n373\n00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.060\nSo you see how this can scale up.\n\n374\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.560\nUltimately, you're going to scale\nout of these functional areas and\n\n375\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.220\nmay have to departmentalize things, right?\n\n376\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.990\nIn a large organization you might be able\nto definitely have the structure where\n\n377\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.820\nthere's the technical management team.\n\n378\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:11.240\nThey have 40 people in the technical\nmanagement team, they do infrastructure.\n\n379\n00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.920\nWe have the application team,\nthe application management team,\n\n380\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.460\nthey have 20 people and\nthey work over in applications.\n\n381\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.820\nWe have the IT operations team,\nthere's 60 people there.\n\n382\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.240\nAnd we have 28 people on the service desk,\nright?\n\n383\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.380\nThat sort of thing.\n\n384\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:30.340\nAnd you actually name the functions\nby the way ITIL calls them out.\n\n385\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.720\nYou have organizational departments,\nif you will.\n\n386\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.900\nSo this departmentalization,\nthis idea of departmentalization\n\n387\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.090\nis a method of governance as we\ntalked about in the previous episode.\n\n388\n00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.410\nIt's also a method of just understanding\nhow you build in these interfaces.\n\n389\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.850\nSo if you're marching toward a pretty\npicture, if you look at the graphic here,\n\n390\n00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.770\nif you're marching toward a pretty picture\nwith the pretty organizational silos\n\n391\n00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:00.030\ncompletely interfaced horizontally\nin a matrix type of organization,\n\n392\n00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.520\nif that's what your goal is,\n\n393\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.580\nthen a necessary step is probably\ngonna be some departmentalization.\n\n394\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.130\nAgain, not gonna belabor this deeply.\n\n395\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.750\nITIL does not position itself as\nan organizational design best practice.\n\n396\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.580\nBut as you take the exam, be looking for\nthose opportunities to identify\n\n397\n00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:23.430\nare these functions represented, and\nare they represented authoritatively?\n\n398\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.990\nSo even if it's a small organization where\nyou have one person who is the director of\n\n399\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.190\neverything in IT, and he has to make\nall the decisions about technical,\n\n400\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:36.150\napplications, day to day operations,\nand service desk, he manages it all.\n\n401\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.480\nIf that particularly scenario plays\nout that way and there are things\n\n402\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.210\nfalling over, it might be an opportunity\nto delegate and get more resources.\n\n403\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.290\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n404\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.818\nIs it scalable enough?\n\n405\n00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:54.480\nAll right, so as we look at the graphic\nhere regarding organizational design.\n\n406\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.900\nAgain, ITIL is not a best practice for\norganizational design.\n\n407\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.460\nAs you're trying to consider the question,\n\n408\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.090\nthe departmentalization,\nfunctions can be part of that.\n\n409\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.260\nYou might decide to divide and\nconquer by product, right?\n\n410\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.860\nMaybe you offer three core products.\n\n411\n00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.860\nImagine a bank.\nI am not sure\n\n412\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.270\nbanks structure themselves this way,\nI am totally making this up, all right?\n\n413\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.390\nBut this kind of resonates\nwith me as an example.\n\n414\n00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.650\nYou might have a commercial\nloan department,\n\n415\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.580\nyou might have a consumer loan department.\n\n416\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:27.380\nMaybe both of those loan departments\nreport to a single person for loans.\n\n417\n00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.670\nSo, I can kinda see that\norganizational structure.\n\n418\n00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.960\nImagine organizational chart\nlooks like that, right?\n\n419\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.240\nAnd then you have the consumer\nbanking piece, not the loans, but\n\n420\n00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.440\nthe consumer banking side of it.\n\n421\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.300\nAnd then you might have the financial\nmanagement side of it as different\n\n422\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.250\nbusiness concerns.\n\n423\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:48.270\nSo that's breaking it down by the market\nspace that you're playing in.\n\n424\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.690\nYou're playing in the load department,\nyou're playing in the banking department,\n\n425\n00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.380\nyou're playing in financial\nservices department, right?\n\n426\n00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.290\nThat could be one way to departmentalize,\nright?\n\n427\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.350\nSo, as IT would respond to that,\n\n428\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.380\ndoes IT respond to that with\na separate IT department for each one?\n\n429\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.070\nDoes IT respond to that with a single\nIT department that serves them all?\n\n430\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.230\nSome hybrid of that?\n\n431\n00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.910\nAgain, ITIL is not answering\nthat question, and, honestly,\n\n432\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:21.320\nthey're not going to be diving into on\nan exam the intricacies of such questions.\n\n433\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.720\nThey don't pretend to be\nan organizational best practice.\n\n434\n00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.163\nBut can you get a sense for how the lack\nof organizational sign could affect\n\n435\n00:22:29.163 --> 00:22:31.705\nyour success in delivering IT services?\n\n436\n00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:33.880\nThat' s where you try to connect the dots.\n\n437\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.539\nAs this happens on the exam,\nthey will be more explicit,\n\n438\n00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:40.070\nnot trying to ferret out some nuances.\n\n439\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.170\nThey will be explicit about the effects\nof organizational design on any given\n\n440\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.409\nscenario and ask you to say\nwhat would you do differently.\n\n441\n00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:51.020\nAnd the primary difference you\nwould make would be beginning with\n\n442\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.960\nthe delegation of responsibilities.\n\n443\n00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.410\nAssigning an ownership to a process.\n\n444\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.606\nAssigning an ownership to\nthe entire stage, potentially.\n\n445\n00:22:58.606 --> 00:23:02.480\nOkay, all right, good.\n\n446\n00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.480\nSo moving forward through some more\norganizational design factors.\n\n447\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.880\nYou see here what is\nthe appropriate design?\n\n448\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.280\nThis is suggesting,\nwe saw these five stages earlier,\n\n449\n00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.130\nthe network, directive, delegation,\ncoordination, and collaboration.\n\n450\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.950\nYou see them on the right side here.\n\n451\n00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.870\nMake it a process design.\n\n452\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.078\nIf you delegate processes\nto appropriate owners, and\n\n453\n00:23:29.078 --> 00:23:34.144\nthen attach the ownership of those\nprocesses to the appropriate stages in\n\n454\n00:23:34.144 --> 00:23:39.209\nthe organization, you'll tend to find,\nagain, you'll tend to find,\n\n455\n00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:44.137\nthat strategy decisions are gonna\nbe upper management and executive.\n\n456\n00:23:44.137 --> 00:23:48.063\nSo, more technical management and\napplication management are gonna be\n\n457\n00:23:48.063 --> 00:23:52.261\nthe functions that provide the people\nthat can show up at strategy meetings.\n\n458\n00:23:52.261 --> 00:23:55.829\nWhereas IT operations management\nis more The day to day grind,\n\n459\n00:23:55.829 --> 00:23:59.127\nturn the crane get this thing out,\nback up those servers,\n\n460\n00:23:59.127 --> 00:24:02.490\nrestore those servers,\nfix the printer queue, right?\n\n461\n00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.210\nThat day to day maintenance of things,\n\n462\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.140\nthe fill the generators up, keep the\nlights on in the data center, etc, right?\n\n463\n00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.620\nIt could be that geographic\nfactor affect this,\n\n464\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.800\nthat you have distinct\ngeographic locations.\n\n465\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.870\nThere each different business unit and\nthey are different geographically\n\n466\n00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.340\nprovided a appropriate level of\ncollaboration across those multiple\n\n467\n00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.500\ngeographies to make it work, okay.\n\n468\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.389\nNow again, how this is equate to at\noverall structure you see here that\n\n469\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.560\nyou have your strategy.\n\n470\n00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.800\nWhat you're trying to get done,\nyou have a departmental structure.\n\n471\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.520\nThis is happening outside the business,\nI'm sorry, outside of IT.\n\n472\n00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.770\nThe business is making these\ndecisions to a large part, right?\n\n473\n00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.850\nAnd you have your key processes,\nthese are key business processes.\n\n474\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.685\nAnd then you associate the organizational\nstructure with those processes, right.\n\n475\n00:24:57.685 --> 00:25:01.805\nOf course, identifying the right people,\nthat's where the delegation comes,\n\n476\n00:25:01.805 --> 00:25:05.950\ngiving them the right roles and\nresponsibilities, and then keep score.\n\n477\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:06.450\nHow you doing, right?\n\n478\n00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.280\nI'm supposed to design\nthe change management process or\n\n479\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.780\ninstant management process, Zach's over\nthere designing the problem management\n\n480\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.780\nprocess, how good's the problem\nanswering process going, Zach?\n\n481\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.640\nI look at the measurements,\ndoesn't look like you're doing too good.\n\n482\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.790\nZach calls to me,\nhey I saw your instant management metrics,\n\n483\n00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.390\nthey're not looking too good,\neither, right.\n\n484\n00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.930\nSo measurement can be a way\nto govern the success of me,\n\n485\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.380\nas an instant management process owner.\n\n486\n00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.710\nIt could be a way to measure Zach\nas a problem management owner.\n\n487\n00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.750\nAre we going to get these measurements up?\n\n488\n00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.520\nGet the idea there.\n\n489\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.350\nSo, ultimately measurement and\nperformance are gonna play in.\n\n490\n00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.110\nAnd, hopefully, you come up with\nan appropriate improvement scheme.\n\n491\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:49.660\nAnd training and orientation scheme to\nlift up theses processes from the ground.\n\n492\n00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.860\nAnd make them effective across\nthe organization, okay.\n\n493\n00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Checks and balances.\n\n494\n00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.240\nThat's organizational considerations\nin a nutshell regarding ITIL.\n\n495\n00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:04.310\nI highly recommend that as you\nlook at the sample papers look\n\n496\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.550\nat how they focus on organizational,\nand validate that it's important,\n\n497\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.580\nit's not to be scoffed at but\nit's not deep, either.\n\n498\n00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.560\nYou're not gonna go deep diving into\nthe organizational aspects of design.\n\n499\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.030\nIf you want to implement ITEL, if you\nwant to adopt ITEL into an organization,\n\n500\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.830\nalso understand that\nit's not a trivial thing.\n\n501\n00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.250\nThat's the real key thing\nthat will show up on an exam.\n\n502\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.390\nIf you wanna adopt Itil,\nit's not a two month project.\n\n503\n00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.240\nIt's not, okay, get back to me in three\nmonths and we'll be an ITIL shop, right?\n\n504\n00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.020\nIt's not that kind of deal.\n\n505\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.930\nIt's the kind of deal that requires\na lot of thought, a lot of delegation,\n\n506\n00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.020\na lot of organizational considerations.\n\n507\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.560\nPotentially even organizational changes.\n\n508\n00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.380\nThat's what the overarching themes of,\n\n509\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.830\nhow you would approach the organizational\nchallenges of IT service management.\n\n510\n00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.170\nSo in addition to following these\nepisodes along from my lecture,\n\n511\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.960\nthe importance of self-study\ncannot be overstated.\n\n512\n00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.170\nSo please take a look at the exercises and\nactivities that are available for you.\n\n513\n00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.690\nIn the episode files link up above, click\non that, and you'll find various things\n\n514\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.100\nthat will reinforce the learning\nobjectives that we just went through.\n\n515\n00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.950\nOne of them is called Service Strategy,\nthe Logical Organization Structure for\n\n516\n00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.220\nan IT Service Provider, right.\n\n517\n00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.430\nAnd then there's another one called\nService Operational Functions,\n\n518\n00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.000\nService Operations Functions.\n\n519\n00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.940\nSo it'll look into those functions and\ndescribe them meaningfully.\n\n520\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.718\nAnd then there's another one\ncalled selecting service delivery,\n\n521\n00:27:31.718 --> 00:27:37.870\nright strategies, is how we go about\nappropriating the appropriate strategy for\n\n522\n00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.380\nthe given service delivery\nmodule that we're talking about.\n\n523\n00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.410\nSo, have a look at those exercises.\n\n524\n00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.730\nReinforce that learning.\n\n525\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.520\nCome visit the forum, ask your questions\nthere, about that subject matter,\n\n526\n00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.770\nor any subject matter related to ITIL.\n\n527\n00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.590\nYou'll find experts there to respond.\n\n528\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.190\nOther peers, other students learning this.\n\n529\n00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.100\nCome to the forum, interact.\n\n530\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.000\nAnd enjoy your studies.\n\n531\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Come to the ITIL island and\nstay a while.\n\n532\n00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.040\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Terry, great job, great job.\n\n533\n00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.640\nITIL MALC,\norganization across the life cycle.\n\n534\n00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.470\nThere is so\nmuch content in the ITIL MALC library, so\n\n535\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.980\nmany videos to watch, watch them all.\n\n536\n00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.860\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n537\n00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.600\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n538\n00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.390\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n539\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.450\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n540\n00:28:15.450 -->

00:00:11.902\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.380\njoining us ITProTV helping\nyou learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.410\nI'm you host Zack Memos,\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n7\n00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.230\nThis is the importance of measurement.\n\n8\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.250\nAnd I know a guy who can tell us all\n\n9\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.901\nabout this because he's an ITIL\nexpert Terry Decker right over here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.407\nHi Terry?\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n11\n00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:34.110\nAnd I know a guy who's listened to enough\n\n12\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.490\nlectures for me that he can answer some\nof these questions about the importance\n\n13\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.080\nof measurements.\n\n14\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.810\nSo I'm gonna pick on Zach a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.100\nZack why measure?\n\n16\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.450\n&gt;&gt; So you have an exact,\nyour using data as opposed to conjecture.\n\n17\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.230\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n18\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.800\nIt's not an opinion anymore.\n\n19\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.550\nIf someone says it's slow and you don't\nhave a measurement, they're whining.\n\n20\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.840\nIt's just a complaint, it's anecdotal.\n\n21\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.920\nIt's just a story to tell.\n\n22\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.059\nNow I'm not saying they're wrong.\n\n23\n00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.660\nI'm just saying it's a rumor,\nit could be slow.\n\n24\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, without data it's just whining.\n\n25\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.621\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, without data it's just\nwhining, you can quote me on that.\n\n26\n00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.157\n[CROSSTALK] itiL book, but\nwithout data it's just whining.\n\n27\n00:01:12.157 --> 00:01:13.659\nI think I'll try that with my wife.\n\n28\n00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.704\n&gt;&gt; That was it, that was.\n\n29\n00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:18.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so the importance\nof measurement is just that,\n\n30\n00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:21.730\nnow, I've said this in earlier episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.360\nAnd I want to reinforce it here,\n\n32\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080\nthat measuring IT performance\nitself is important.\n\n33\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.660\nAnd I'm not degrading it in any\nway by stating this next factoid.\n\n34\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.760\nIt's also important to\nmeasure business outcomes.\n\n35\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.100\nSo if you look at this first graphic,\nthis first little slide of bullets.\n\n36\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.770\nI'm not going to read\nthese bullets to you.\n\n37\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.130\nBut as you read these bullets, please note\nthat they are all focused on the business.\n\n38\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.210\nThe only one that's maybe slightly\nnot focused on the business\n\n39\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.300\nis improving service quality.\n\n40\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.080\nThere's not a direct line to the business\nnecessarily but of course, if your service\n\n41\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.610\nis better probably the business is doing\nbetter too, so I kinda get that one.\n\n42\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.580\nSo it's okay to measure your own\nperformance as a server provider,\n\n43\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.640\nabsolutely do.\n\n44\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.440\nMeasure availability, measure the speed\nof your service disk, do all that.\n\n45\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.190\nIt's important.\n\n46\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.920\nThose are good indicators.\n\n47\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.800\nBut really what you're trying to do is\nyou're trying to move the needle for\n\n48\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.730\nthe business.\n\n49\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.450\nSo you align your services with the\nbusiness goals, that's the first bullet.\n\n50\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.580\nThe last is, IT service is aligned\nwith business needs, very synonymous.\n\n51\n00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.970\nBusiness, business, business, making\nsure you are protecting these things.\n\n52\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.620\nMaking sure you are delivering on time,\non budget.\n\n53\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.085\nMaking sure there's\nconsistency in your delivery.\n\n54\n00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:36.860\nBecause the word regularity,\nI believe, in here.\n\n55\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.260\nRight, in sheer regularity.\n\n56\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.430\nIt's predictable.\n\n57\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.830\nThey know it's gonna be there.\n\n58\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.800\nThey know about how quickly you can\nrespond to this type of thing or\n\n59\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.890\nthat type of thing.\n\n60\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820\nThere's some expectations built in,\nand they like those expectations.\n\n61\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.800\nThat's the goal of measurement.\n\n62\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.390\nIt's not a rumor.\n\n63\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.440\nYou're actually measuring these things.\n\n64\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.770\nSo fundamental to improvement,\nas you consider CSI.\n\n65\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.580\nIs understanding where you are right now.\n\n66\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.980\nIs it slow?\n\n67\n00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.470\nGood question.\n\n68\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.480\nWe get lots of complaints that it is slow.\n\n69\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.930\nHow many complaints do\nwe get that it's slow?\n\n70\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.720\nThat would be perhaps\nthe metrics you have, maybe.\n\n71\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.334\nIt would be even better if you're\nactually measuring the speed of things.\n\n72\n00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:21.567\nAnd you have actual data that talks\nabout how slow, not just how many\n\n73\n00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:25.960\ncomplaints you have you have a way\nto measure how fast logarithms are.\n\n74\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.510\nMaybe you do a little special test.\n\n75\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.520\nYou get on there and you try to log\nin ten times this minute and measure.\n\n76\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.080\nDo a little clip board measurement.\n\n77\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.010\nYou do that tomorrow, you take some data.\n\n78\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.900\nOf course, it'd be better if that\nwas automated instead of manual.\n\n79\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.360\nClearly, it would be better\nif that was automated.\n\n80\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.430\nBut, you can get a baseline\nin the absence of data,\n\n81\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.300\nyou can kind of go chase the data,\nand create a baseline for\n\n82\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.980\nwhere you are right now, and\ndo some measurements later.\n\n83\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.920\nYou know what a baseline might be?\n\n84\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.032\nThe baseline could be, I have no data.\n\n85\n00:03:56.032 --> 00:03:59.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what's your improvement idea?\n\n86\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.460\nGet data.\n\n87\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It obviously could be that.\n\n88\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.580\nThe baseline measurement\ncould be I don't have data.\n\n89\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.190\nWhat's the improvement idea?\n\n90\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.360\nI'm gonna go get data,\nI'm gonna figure out how I can collect\n\n91\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.355\ninformation about this rumor\nI hear that it's slow.\n\n92\n00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:18.035\nSo maybe that's your first\nstep in your improvement idea,\n\n93\n00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.075\nis to establish a measurement.\n\n94\n00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:21.855\nIt could be just that.\n\n95\n00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:24.585\nSo as you're looking at the exam\nchallenges, as you're looking at\n\n96\n00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:30.625\nthe the operational challenges, back at\nwork, whether it's the exam or operations,\n\n97\n00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:34.440\nyou're gonna have an opportunity\nto understand where you are now.\n\n98\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.190\nBefore you should move forward.\n\n99\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.700\nThat is critical to your\nsuccess on the exam,\n\n100\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.460\nit's absolutely fundamental\nto your success back at work.\n\n101\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.730\nKnow where you are before\nyou plan your next step,\n\n102\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.510\notherwise you're just kinda\nchasing windmills as Don Quixote.\n\n103\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.532\n&gt;&gt; Don Quixote again.\n\n104\n00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:52.080\n&gt;&gt; Don Quixote again, right.\n\n105\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.750\nOkay.\n\n106\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.880\nSo why measure?\n\n107\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.480\nYou can measure to validate\nthat you're doing fine.\n\n108\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.320\nYou can measure to direct.\n\n109\n00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.570\nMaybe you're not doing so fine so\nnow you're trying to intervene.\n\n110\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.730\nOr you're using to justify.\n\n111\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.410\nMaybe you invested in some technology that\nshowed some improvements in this area of\n\n112\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.742\nthe business, now you want to go and\ndo it in that area of the business.\n\n113\n00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:18.840\nIf you've got data to back up that\nthis actually worked over here?\n\n114\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.080\nYes, yes we do.\n\n115\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.664\nWe had a return on investment\nwithin 18 months, and\n\n116\n00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:27.650\nwe're now just swimming in the gravy for\nthis service.\n\n117\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.480\nLet's do the same thing for\n\n118\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.520\nthis service to see if we can't\nfind that same gravy to swim in.\n\n119\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.100\nThat type of thing.\n\n120\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.900\nSo why measure?\n\n121\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.110\nTo validate, to direct,\nto justify, or to intervene.\n\n122\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.920\nWe've seen this.\n\n123\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.660\nSo, why bother?\n\n124\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.040\nWell, three questions,\nwhy are we monitoring and measuring?\n\n125\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.690\nVery good question.\n\n126\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.340\nIt's possible that you just get\nkind of stale in your metrics.\n\n127\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.000\nWhy are we even measuring this things?\n\n128\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.010\nStart with the vision, why do we\neven care about this measurement?\n\n129\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.630\nWhen should we stop measuring?\n\n130\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.330\nThat's also a valid question.\n\n131\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.110\nAnd is anyone actually using the data?\n\n132\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.330\nI've certainly seen regimes where\nthey get lost in their measurements.\n\n133\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.140\nThey're so good at measuring,\nthey just measure all the time, and\n\n134\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.710\nno one even cares.\n\n135\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.210\nSo coming back to your measurements and\n\n136\n00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.910\nasking these three questions\nto validate that you're\n\n137\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.710\nactually measuring the right things,\nis also important step in your regime.\n\n138\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.070\nNow you've seen this before,\n\n139\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.490\nthe 7 step improvement process,\ngoes around in a circle.\n\n140\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.790\nThe circle's kind of squared off, but you\ncan see it goes around in a circle there.\n\n141\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.440\nAnd it starts off in the upper left\nthere with defining why we even care.\n\n142\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.710\nIt starts with the question.\n\n143\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.990\nWhy do we wanna make this improvement?\n\n144\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.290\nWe have this process for improvement.\n\n145\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.780\nWhy do we care about this improvement?\n\n146\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.250\nSo let's say we're improving speed.\n\n147\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.120\nWhy are improving speed?\n\n148\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.240\nWe have lots of complaints about slow.\n\n149\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.670\nWe got data that suggests it's very,\nvery slow.\n\n150\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.570\nLogins take 30 seconds.\n\n151\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.510\nSpeed is bad.\n\n152\n00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.670\nWe wanna improve speed.\n\n153\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.340\nOkay, you can mess me we\nhave an appropriate vision.\n\n154\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.050\nWe got lots of complaints,\ncustomers care about it, business focus.\n\n155\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.600\nWe got data that says improves, and\nshows that yes in fact, we are slow.\n\n156\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.060\nAll right, let's go define what\ndata we need to go capture\n\n157\n00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.240\nthat's going to give us the indicators of\nwhere we should pick up on this speed.\n\n158\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.800\nSo maybe we go and look at server logs.\n\n159\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.900\nMaybe we pick up database logs,\n\n160\n00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.122\nmaybe we look at the network,\nmaybe the network's a problem.\n\n161\n00:07:28.122 --> 00:07:31.860\nSo we're defining what we want\nto capture in terms of data and\n\n162\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.210\nmaybe it is those three things,\nserver, database, and network.\n\n163\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.170\nBy the way the network people\nsay it's never the network so\n\n164\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.335\ndon't even worry about that one.\n\n165\n00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:40.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n166\n00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:42.390\nyou have three things to go and chase.\n\n167\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.980\nYou're gonna go chase those three\nlogs from all those different\n\n168\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.460\ninfrastructure elements.\n\n169\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.540\nYou've defined what you want to capture.\n\n170\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.620\nYou then go get it.\n\n171\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.910\nYou gather the data,\nyou bring it around the bend.\n\n172\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:52.663\nYou begin to analyze it.\n\n173\n00:07:52.663 --> 00:07:55.514\nMaybe you got to process it\nfirst before you analyze.\n\n174\n00:07:55.514 --> 00:07:56.861\nYou process the data.\n\n175\n00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:58.365\nYou got to normalize it a little bit.\n\n176\n00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:03.660\nLike, for instance, you don't want\nthe server logs on the day of maintenance.\n\n177\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.390\nBecause we know the server\nwasn't available, and\n\n178\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.200\nthey took the darn thing down, so\nlet's get that noise out of there.\n\n179\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.060\nThe same thing for the network, there\nwas a big network outage last weekend.\n\n180\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.550\nLet's get that data out of there,\nsame with database.\n\n181\n00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.900\nKinda normalize it,\nget rid of the noise, so\n\n182\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.630\nyou're looking at a more\nsteady set of data, right?\n\n183\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.130\nSo, you're processed a little bit.\n\n184\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.450\nNow you're analyzing it and it looks like\nfrom the data, the network's sure up,\n\n185\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.190\nthose guys were right.\n\n186\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.940\nIt's not the network, it's always there.\n\n187\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.390\nIt's not the network,\nthe data's good for the network.\n\n188\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.730\nThe server has a problem, but\nwhenever there's a server problem,\n\n189\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.300\nit seems directly related\nto this database issue.\n\n190\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.870\nSomewhere between the server and\nthe database, we got an, now you're doing\n\n191\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.169\nthe analysis of this, so you got\nan idea that's actually the database.\n\n192\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.620\nYou're coming around the bend,\nit's a database.\n\n193\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.890\nYou're coming around the bend and you\npresent the idea that says, we think we\n\n194\n00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.420\ncan improve performance if we do further\nanalysis of database performance.\n\n195\n00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.720\nWe like that idea, now we're not\ntalking about a new project yet.\n\n196\n00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.210\nWe're still going around\nthe bend of what needs to happen.\n\n197\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.998\nWe come back around the bend and say,\n\n198\n00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:09.831\nokay, I see your idea about\nthe database being the issue.\n\n199\n00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:11.143\nThanks for that new data.\n\n200\n00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:14.706\nThe vision is still the same,\nwe are trying to speed up something,\n\n201\n00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:17.838\nbut now we have a target\nregarding database performance.\n\n202\n00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:22.010\nWhat do we need to go look at\nregarding database performance?\n\n203\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:27.540\nWell, our DBAs say that indexes have\na big play into database performance.\n\n204\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.690\nWe don't stop the network,\nso indexes is one of them.\n\n205\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.680\nProcedural overruns,\n\n206\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.660\nbusiness logic could be broken in\nthe the nature of the database.\n\n207\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.400\nIs that slowing down things?\n\n208\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.030\nAll right, all right,\nwe've got a couple avenues.\n\n209\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.350\nGo get its data on that,\naround the bend you go, right?\n\n210\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.240\nNow, again, I was very systemic in that,\nI was looking at systems, right?\n\n211\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.400\nWhat if the challenge is we're not\nvery good at service management?\n\n212\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.460\nThat's a pretty big question, right?\n\n213\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.970\nI'm talking about measure\nacross a lifecycle, so\n\n214\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.900\nI gave you a technical example for\nthe step and step approval process.\n\n215\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.230\nOne of the idea for improvement is,\n\n216\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.110\nI think we need to have formal\nincident in problem processes.\n\n217\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.320\nWhy do you think that's true?\n\n218\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.250\nWhy do you think that's the target?\n\n219\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.440\nWell, the service desk is inconsistent.\n\n220\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.900\nThey respond some days very quickly,\nother days not so quickly,\n\n221\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.760\nand the issues seem to be the same, but\nwe don't really know what the issues are.\n\n222\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.340\nThat sounds like a good candidate for\ninstant management problem is that it\n\n223\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.940\ncould do with some trend analysis that's\nwhat the value of these things are.\n\n224\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.610\nOkay, I believe you that the service\ndesk is unresponsive, and\n\n225\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.140\nthe data to prove that is customer\nsatisfaction surveys that are saying\n\n226\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.350\nthe service desk is unresponsive,\nso it's really just opinion based.\n\n227\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:51.170\nBut we want to improve customer\nsatisfaction and service desk is failing.\n\n228\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.830\nWe want to improve instant management and\nproblem management has a way to do that.\n\n229\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.790\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n230\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.920\nAgain around the bend you go.\n\n231\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.300\nYou implement the processes and\nthen you measure again.\n\n232\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.730\nMaybe do the survey again.\n\n233\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.780\nMaybe you start tracking\nthat incident data.\n\n234\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.120\nAnd you corroborate that indeed.\n\n235\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.310\nThe customer's complaining\nabout service desk response,\n\n236\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.870\nit's corroborated by the data.\n\n237\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.210\nWe are pretty bad.\n\n238\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:19.180\nAbout 60% of our tickets are resolved\nwithin two hours, but 40% are not.\n\n239\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.500\nThat's probably going to indicate\ntheir dissatisfaction with it.\n\n240\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.430\nBy the way, do we have an SLA for this?\n\n241\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.350\nHm, that's another good idea for\nIT service level improvement.\n\n242\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.000\nDo we have a service management process?\n\n243\n00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.300\nNo, so we got targets.\n\n244\n00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.660\nWe got data, but we don't even\nknow what the customer wants.\n\n245\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.830\nMaybe 60% is effective, who knows?\n\n246\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.970\nWell, let's go talk with the customers.\n\n247\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.150\nSo, all these improvement ideas can\ncome out in different manifestations.\n\n248\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.050\nCustomers complaining,\ncosts are overrunning, quality is down,\n\n249\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.570\navailability is down,\nit fails all the time.\n\n250\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.650\nFunctionality is bad, right?\n\n251\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.130\nThere could all kinds of indicators,\nthere could be rumors or\n\n252\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.000\nit could be backed by data.\n\n253\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.800\nIn the absence of data, your answer on\nthe question is to find the regime,\n\n254\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.640\nto find data, right?\n\n255\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.550\nIn the presence of data, your regime is to\nfind a way to analyze it effectively and\n\n256\n00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.690\nmeasure it effectively.\n\n257\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.370\nProcess it, present it, etc.\n\n258\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.510\nThe seven step approved processes,\nback to the graphic is simply trying\n\n259\n00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:20.030\nto get you oriented toward something\nthat you can do as a matter of regiment.\n\n260\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.310\nIt can be done for the big things.\n\n261\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.010\nLet's adopt ITIL.\n\n262\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.410\nIt could also be done for\nthe smaller things,\n\n263\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.960\nlike lets improve incident management.\n\n264\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.970\nAnd all points in-between.\n\n265\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.190\nA consistent theme here is,\nyou look at the cycle, and\n\n266\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.920\nyou look at exam questions...and as you\ntry to apply this back at the office.\n\n267\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.450\nLook...\n\n268\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.920\nBefore you leap, understand where you are.\n\n269\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.980\nThat's the importance of the baseline.\n\n270\n00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.950\nUnderstand where you want to\nbe based on business vision.\n\n271\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.930\nWhat is the business trying to do?\n\n272\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.950\nThen you can effectively plan\nan appropriate response and\n\n273\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.020\ngo around this cycle of\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n274\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.470\nNow this could turn into\na knowledge spiral.\n\n275\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.620\nI'll give you an example of an.\n\n276\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.180\nIf you've taken, listened to some of my\nother courses, this comes up in those too.\n\n277\n00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.580\nBut this is a true story,\nabout how an in a technical environment\n\n278\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.330\ncould have been better served\nthan what I did back in the day.\n\n279\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.540\nSo, I'll give you what really happened.\n\n280\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.180\nWhat really happened, was I had an outage\nto this service I was responsible for.\n\n281\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.930\nI got to wake in 3 o'clock in the morning,\nservice was really degraded, I came,\n\n282\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.760\ntried to respond right away,\nI really couldn't find it.\n\n283\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.040\nFive hours later, the US is coming online\nand it just falls over completely.\n\n284\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.550\nI'm five hours in to\ndegradational outage now, right?\n\n285\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.860\nAnd 1 o'clock in the afternoon now,\nanother five hours have passed and\n\n286\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.630\nI still don't know why my service\nisn't working, I don't know why.\n\n287\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.910\nNot a great place to be,\nwasn't a fun morning.\n\n288\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.890\nRight?\nBy happens to ask\n\n289\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.455\none of the database administrators\nadministrators happen to be on the call,\n\n290\n00:13:58.455 --> 00:14:01.135\nthey didn't work for me, they're just\nsomebody who has some expertise,\n\n291\n00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:05.205\ncome to the call, come to the meeting,\nsaid I got an idea.\n\n292\n00:14:05.205 --> 00:14:06.495\nAnd his idea was correct.\n\n293\n00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:08.485\nIt was having to do with the indexes.\n\n294\n00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:10.125\nThey needed to be recompiled.\n\n295\n00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.695\nI had no idea that indexes\nneed to be recompiled.\n\n296\n00:14:12.695 --> 00:14:17.805\nThank you Mr DBA, recompiled my indexes,\nI'm back and up and running.\n\n297\n00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:21.580\nNow I have some skin in this game,\nI'm glad I'm up and running Right?\n\n298\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.900\nThankfully, I would have done this anyway,\nbut certain I should say thankfully.\n\n299\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.740\nYou know what happens.\n\n300\n00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.410\nWhat happened, Terry?\n\n301\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.890\nWhat are you gonna do about it?\n\n302\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.080\nWhat are you gonna do to keep\nthat from happening again?\n\n303\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.270\nI got it.\nI got it, I got it.\n\n304\n00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.220\nI talked to the DBA,\nI said please, write me a script.\n\n305\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.850\nDo something that lets me, without\nbothering you, recompile these scripts\n\n306\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.190\nWhen I do maintenance schedules,\nthat sort of thing, so he did.\n\n307\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.750\nSo I took an operational lesson that day,\nwow,\n\n308\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.760\ndatabases can have indexes that need\nto be recompiled, I did not know that.\n\n309\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.290\nI took an operational lesson and\n\n310\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.930\ncame up with a tactic to\nkeep that happening for me.\n\n311\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.100\nSo I took an operational lesson and\nturned into a tactical response.\n\n312\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.640\nMy tactical response is,\nthis is not gonna happen to me anymore.\n\n313\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.940\nGood for me.\nNow here's where\n\n314\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.260\nthe story gets kinda sour,\nseven years later, so quite a bit later,\n\n315\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.840\nthe knowledge-life cycle spiral should\nbe a little bit faster than that.\n\n316\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.590\nBut seven years later I'm now\nin their IT service management,\n\n317\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.310\nI'm no longer the technical\noperations manager for this service,\n\n318\n00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.530\nI'm not involved in the servers\nanymore Anymore, right.\n\n319\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.550\nI'm not a technical manager,\n\n320\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.470\nI'm a service manager, and\nI come to work at the normal time.\n\n321\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.840\nAnd it just so\nhappens it was the same general service.\n\n322\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.300\nIt was a different platform, etc.\n\n323\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.760\nbut it was the same service, same group\nof people were at the meeting, basically,\n\n324\n00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.320\nwhen I came in.\n\n325\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.800\nThey said, \"Terry, you used to work\non this.\" Does this ring a bell?\n\n326\n00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.360\nYou have any idea?\n\n327\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.420\nWe've been down five hours, right?\n\n328\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.969\nI said, I looked like a genius that day.\n\n329\n00:15:46.969 --> 00:15:49.877\nI said,\ndid you check the recompile index things?\n\n330\n00:15:49.877 --> 00:15:54.048\nLike, as if I knew, right, because it\nwas just a flashback instantly, right.\n\n331\n00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:58.331\nNow, think about the knowledge\nspiral in a more methodical way.\n\n332\n00:15:58.331 --> 00:15:58.928\nRight?\n\n333\n00:15:58.928 --> 00:16:03.294\nWhat if seven years prior,\nafter I created my operational lesson, or\n\n334\n00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:08.570\nit was created for me, and\nthen I created my tactical response to it.\n\n335\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.810\nWhat if back then I took the effort\nto let other people know, hey,\n\n336\n00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.940\nyou know what,\nthis could happen to you too.\n\n337\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.030\nWhy don't you avoid the pain I just felt,\nby implementing, testing,\n\n338\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.440\nlooking at your databases.\n\n339\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.340\nDo they suffer from this vulnerability,\nright?\n\n340\n00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.680\nNow, again,\nseven years after the fact, I realized\n\n341\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.110\nthat this knowledge spiral should\nprobably escalate a little bit higher.\n\n342\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.780\nBe better,\nmore strategic in it's approach.\n\n343\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.420\nAnd what I did, because I had more\nstake in the game now, I had a lot\n\n344\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.180\nmore services I was responsible for, I did\ntake a more methodical approach to it.\n\n345\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.771\nI analyzed all the services I had\nthat had databases underneath the,\n\n346\n00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:50.164\nI had a DBA say whether or not my\nservices were vulnerable to that same\n\n347\n00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:54.580\ndefec,t if you will, and\nturns out that I had several in the woods.\n\n348\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.519\nNow, I don't know how\nto fix it completely,\n\n349\n00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:58.867\nI could just keep up with\nthe maintenance schedule, or\n\n350\n00:16:58.867 --> 00:17:02.210\nwas there a more holistic way to\ndeal with database issues like this.\n\n351\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.260\nAnd I got funding for a little project for\n\n352\n00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.010\nsix months to take care of mine,\nto optimize my databases.\n\n353\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.040\nNot to just to maintain them but\nto optimize the indexes.\n\n354\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.570\nSo they self recompiled at\nappropriate times basically.\n\n355\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.370\nWhich you can procedurally do,\nagain who knew, I wasn't that expert, but\n\n356\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.640\nI got the right experts in the room\nto make such recommendations.\n\n357\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.130\nAnd because we have such critical\noutages of critical systems,\n\n358\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.500\nI can get funding for\nthis availability improvement, right.\n\n359\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.600\nNow, I should also publish the white\npaper for everyone to see.\n\n360\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.180\nNow, as an organization,\nwe had evolved over they years.\n\n361\n00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.420\nThere was a place for me to go, and\nreport my findings of a major outage.\n\n362\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.930\nWe didn't have that back,\nseven years prior.\n\n363\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.150\nSo the organization evolves somewhat,\nso, if there was a major outage,\n\n364\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.510\nthere was a place she went to\nshow your lessons learned.\n\n365\n00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.160\nAnd it was a matter of discipline that\npeople would regularly go there and\n\n366\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.480\nsee if they might have some\nvulnerabilities themselves.\n\n367\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.230\nAgain to try to forestall,\nto have strategic learning,\n\n368\n00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.710\nnot just tactical learning.\n\n369\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.800\nAnd sure enough, people saw my response,\n\n370\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.290\nthey saw my findings and my response and\nthey wanted to be part of it.\n\n371\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:12.250\nSo, my six month project with\ntwo DBA's became a 12 month\n\n372\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.560\nproject with four DBAs, supporting\nlots of different organizational\n\n373\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.830\nchallenges across the database landscape,\nif you will.\n\n374\n00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.769\nSo, you see the idea.\n\n375\n00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:26.475\nAgain back to the graphic, this knowledge\nspiral of turning an operational\n\n376\n00:18:26.475 --> 00:18:30.370\nlesson into a tactical one,\nnotice the seven step approvement\n\n377\n00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.430\nprocess is what that little graphic is,\nis looking at division.\n\n378\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.970\nWhy do we care about this?\n\n379\n00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.080\nWell, because there was an outage, right?\n\n380\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.430\nThe little picture is,\nactually, this big thing here.\n\n381\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.760\nSo, it's just a little microcosm of\nthe seven step improvement process driving\n\n382\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.940\nimprovements across, in my case,\neventually to a strategic direction.\n\n383\n00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:58.150\nSo, CSI, and measurement together can\ndrive organisational improvements,\n\n384\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.960\nnot just operation ones, not just tactical\nones, but actually strategic ones.\n\n385\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.920\nSo, the organisation as\na whole can get better, right?\n\n386\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.960\nNow, this really started with,\nwhat, yep Zack\n\n387\n00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.830\n&gt;&gt; Great, that's great.\n\n388\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.580\nThat's fantastic.\n\n389\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.070\n&gt;&gt; So now looking at, what metrics to use,\nwhich ones you're gonna,\n\n390\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.345\nobviously that example I just mentioned\nhad availability at its core.\n\n391\n00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:24.557\nThe services were down and that's kind of\none of the golden metrics, if you will,\n\n392\n00:19:24.557 --> 00:19:26.094\nis the service unavailable?\n\n393\n00:19:26.094 --> 00:19:27.133\nIs it available?\n\n394\n00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:29.720\nSo you are talking about\ntechnology metrics there.\n\n395\n00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.650\nThings making that service\navailable is an important aspect.\n\n396\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.110\nSo you wanna measure technology metrics.\n\n397\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:41.620\nYou also wanna consider process metrics,\nhow effective are your processes, right?\n\n398\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.980\nAnd also end-to-end service metrics.\n\n399\n00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.630\nSo if you consider the metric's framework,\n\n400\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.400\nyou wanna have a breath of measurement,\nnot just technology metrics.\n\n401\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.363\nBut you also wanna look at how\neffective the service is, right.\n\n402\n00:19:54.363 --> 00:19:57.340\nAnd they're related but\nnot identical, right?\n\n403\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.130\nAnd process metrics are,\n\n404\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.160\nand technology metrics are subset\nof your service metrics.\n\n405\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.240\nService metrics end to end.\n\n406\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.710\nHow is the service doing?\n\n407\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.430\nAre you selling more widgets?\n\n408\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.410\nAre you doing things more\nquickly with more accuracy?\n\n409\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.560\nRight, that's the service metrics,\n\n410\n00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.510\nthe business value proposition,\nas well as everything in between.\n\n411\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.150\nI've cited some examples before.\n\n412\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.470\nWhat if your service requires\nthe fulfillment of requests\n\n413\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.040\non a regular basis, right?\n\n414\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.990\nPeople come to you and request things and\nyou must fulfill that request.\n\n415\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:33.690\nFor hardware or for some sort of\nprocess implementation or whatnot.\n\n416\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.810\nIf your service is driven through request\nfulfillment, then your end to end service\n\n417\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.810\nmetrics are gonna be tightly related to\nyour request fulfillment process, right.\n\n418\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.580\nSo if the service is available but\n\n419\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.200\nyou can't fulfill the request,\nthen can they even use your service?\n\n420\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.210\nThat sort of thing.\n\n421\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.230\nSo that's what we're talking about, end to\nend and have some sort of balance in this.\n\n422\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:21:00.060\nAnd ultimately, what your metrics need to\nbe related to is critical success factors.\n\n423\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.780\nIf you look up through here,\nyou'll see we got measurements and\n\n424\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.600\nMetrics down here, lower right.\n\n425\n00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.370\nLet me get my laser pointer going here.\n\n426\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.430\nWe got measurement and metrics down\nhere in the lower right, right?\n\n427\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.400\nThey are supporting key\nperformance indicators,\n\n428\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.830\nwhich then in turn support\ncritical success factors.\n\n429\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.460\nAnd critical success factors are based on\nthe objectives that you're trying to meet.\n\n430\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.600\nSo let's say your objective\nis customer satisfaction.\n\n431\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.830\nWhat could be a critical success\nfactor for customer satisfaction?\n\n432\n00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.080\nYour objective is to satisfied customers.\n\n433\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.053\nCritical success factor\ncould be 99.9% availability.\n\n434\n00:21:38.053 --> 00:21:40.470\nWe want the service to be available.\n\n435\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:45.470\nWe want the service desk to be very\nresponsive when they have issues.\n\n436\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.230\nThose are critical success factors.\n\n437\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.058\nResponsive service desk,\nthat plays into customer satisfaction,\n\n438\n00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:56.720\nan available service,\nthat plays into customer satisfaction.\n\n439\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.670\nSo now you got two critical success\nfactors, availability and responsiveness.\n\n440\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.429\nCritical success factors\nare often rendered in words.\n\n441\n00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:12.100\nKPIs, key performance indicators,\nare always rendered in numbers, right.\n\n442\n00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.920\nThere’s measurements for underpinning\nthese key performance indicators, right.\n\n443\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.980\nSo you're going out and get the data,\nyou find out how available you are,\n\n444\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.790\nyou find out how responsive you are,\nyou produce those measurements and\n\n445\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.680\ndriving them towards metrics.\n\n446\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.082\nWhich the difference\nbetween a measurement and\n\n447\n00:22:28.082 --> 00:22:31.451\nmetric is basically between raw data and\nprocessed data, right?\n\n448\n00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:36.136\nAnd once you have this metric to\nshows that 60% of your tickets\n\n449\n00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:39.120\nwere resolved within 2 hours, right?\n\n450\n00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:45.780\nThat is a metric now, your KPI could be\na percentage increase, 80% is the target,\n\n451\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:52.720\nso we need a 20% increase in the number\nof tickets resolved within two hours.\n\n452\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.373\nThat sort of thing.\n\n453\n00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:54.550\nSo, you're linking the dots.\n\n454\n00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.663\nNow, if you go upstream to the green bits,\n\n455\n00:22:56.663 --> 00:23:00.030\nyour objectives are actually based\non business outcomes, right.\n\n456\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:07.280\nThe goals and mission and vision,\nthe strategic context for\n\n457\n00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.970\nwhy you even are beginning to measure,\nright.\n\n458\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.460\n&gt;&gt; Grace.\n\n459\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.679\n&gt;&gt; So that's critical stress factors and\nKPIs, right.\n\n460\n00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.580\nSo, what does this mean?\n\n461\n00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.295\nIt means that you need to measure often,\nmeasure well,\n\n462\n00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:27.157\nby well I mean pick the right metrics, and\nmeasure with an appropriate breath, right.\n\n463\n00:23:27.157 --> 00:23:31.489\nA balance of key performance\nindicators will give you a good lens\n\n464\n00:23:31.489 --> 00:23:35.630\nthrough which to judge\nthe satisfaction of your customers.\n\n465\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.994\nYou're moving the needle\non your [CROSSTALK].\n\n466\n00:23:36.994 --> 00:23:38.368\n&gt;&gt; Measure twice cut once.\n\n467\n00:23:38.368 --> 00:23:39.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.475\n&gt;&gt; So what about these measurements?\n\n469\n00:23:40.475 --> 00:23:44.350\nI completely just said\nthat KPIs are often,\n\n470\n00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.024\nare always rendered in numbers, right?\n\n471\n00:23:48.024 --> 00:23:52.573\nThey're also rendered as\na movement toward a target.\n\n472\n00:23:52.573 --> 00:23:59.330\n10% increase in, 20% decrease in,\nmovement toward, increase, decrease.\n\n473\n00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.851\nNot just a target, but\na movement toward a target,\n\n474\n00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:08.582\nand I mentioned that there\nare going to be numbers, so\n\n475\n00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:12.382\nhow is it that I can\nhave a qualitative KPI.\n\n476\n00:24:12.382 --> 00:24:17.940\nI mean if I'm measuring speed, that's just\na stopwatch, that's a number, has time.\n\n477\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.680\nIf I'm measuring availability,\nit's just math.\n\n478\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.510\nYou promised to be up 40 hours,\nyou're only up 36 hours.\n\n479\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:30.950\n4 hours out of 40 year down that\nmeans you have 10% downtime.\n\n480\n00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.575\nThat means your availability is 90%.\n\n481\n00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:33.570\nIt's just math.\n\n482\n00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.610\nSo that is quantitative.\n\n483\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.882\nHow can you have a qualitative?\n\n484\n00:24:37.882 --> 00:24:39.910\nI'm challenge you a little bit here Zach.\n\n485\n00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:44.670\nHow could you have a measurement,\na number, for\n\n486\n00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.290\nqualitative, subjective opinions?\n\n487\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.400\n&gt;&gt; Well qualitative would not\n\n488\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.880\ninfer getting opinions\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n489\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.320\n&gt;&gt; From individuals, even.\n\n490\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.550\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n491\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.650\n&gt;&gt; How can you turn that\ninto a number potentially?\n\n492\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.300\n&gt;&gt; You've stumped me.\n\n493\n00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.570\n&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry.\n\n494\n00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.100\nWe're good.\n\n495\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.810\nThat's fine.\n\n496\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.090\n&gt;&gt; You got me there.\n\n497\n00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:04.590\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n498\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.070\nAsk them and put it on a scale,\nfor instance.\n\n499\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.500\nLike a survey.\n\n500\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.340\nHow satisfied are you?\n\n501\n00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.190\nWell, that's an opinion.\n\n502\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.340\nAre you satisfied?\n\n503\n00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.185\nIt could be yes or no.\n\n504\n00:25:13.185 --> 00:25:13.857\n&gt;&gt; Those are opinions, right.\n\n505\n00:25:13.857 --> 00:25:16.510\n&gt;&gt; You could say how satisfied, right?\n\n506\n00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.200\nOn a scale of one to five,\nare you very satisfied.\n\n507\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.320\nSo now you're starting to turn that into\na number on the scale of things, right?\n\n508\n00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.320\nEven if it's just a yes, no answer, what's\nthe percentage of people that said yes?\n\n509\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.980\nWhat's the percentage\nof people that said no?\n\n510\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n511\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.960\n&gt;&gt; So even if you don't have\na scale like one through five,\n\n512\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.120\nyou could quantify qualitative\nsubjective data, if you will.\n\n513\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.549\nIf you ask 100 people, do you like it,\nand 60 of them say yes,\n\n514\n00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:47.290\nthen 60% of your people like it,\nand 40% don't.\n\n515\n00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, then you get a number, right.\n\n516\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthen you end up with a number.\n\n517\n00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Also something you can march toward.\n\n518\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:57.620\nNow, again scale and surveys and I'm not\ngonna get into art of survey making and\n\n519\n00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.580\nart of measurement of qualitative,\nsubjective data.\n\n520\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.150\nBut I do want to reinforce\nthat qualitative,\n\n521\n00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.820\nsubjective things can\nbe turned to numbers.\n\n522\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.680\nAnd when you talk about measurement,\nultimately it's going to be a number.\n\n523\n00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.280\nAnd you wanna show movement\ntowards those particular targets\n\n524\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:14.988\nyou're trying to get done.\n\n525\n00:26:14.988 --> 00:26:16.630\nFantastic.\n\n526\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.430\nAll right, so you can get qualitative.\n\n527\n00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.760\nOf course, you can get quantitative.\n\n528\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.220\nHere's some quantitative KPIs.\n\n529\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.540\nCritical success factor reduce IT cost.\n\n530\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.890\nSo notice the movement toward a target,\nthe KPI.\n\n531\n00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.750\nSo the critical success\nfactor is We must be cheaper.\n\n532\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:39.757\nThe KPI is 10% cash reduction in\nthe cost of handling printer incidence.\n\n533\n00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:41.521\nAll right, SO there is a KPI,\n\n534\n00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:45.488\n10% cash reduction in the cost\nof handling printer incidence.\n\n535\n00:26:45.488 --> 00:26:46.624\nIt's KPI in two ways.\n\n536\n00:26:46.624 --> 00:26:51.690\nIt's got a number, 10% it's also\ngot a movement towards a target.\n\n537\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.170\nIn this case a decrease reduction, right?\n\n538\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.850\nSo to get that particular KPI delivered,\nwhat do you have to measure?\n\n539\n00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.310\nYou have to know what it currently costs,\nright?\n\n540\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.830\nIf you're trying to move for\na 10% reduction,\n\n541\n00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.752\nwell you gotta know where you are now.\n\n542\n00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:10.270\nRemember the idea about a a baseline?\n\n543\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.680\nSee how it's all tying back in to\nthe same things we've run before?\n\n544\n00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.060\nSo original cost of handling printer\ninstants, you gotta know that.\n\n545\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.880\nAnd then of course your final cost.\n\n546\n00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.830\nWhat’s it now costing you and\nthen do the math.\n\n547\n00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.460\nIs it 10% less.\n\n548\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.570\nSo yes measurements,\nyou've got metrics, right.\n\n549\n00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.730\nSo the measurements here, so\n\n550\n00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.930\nyou've got the metrics you're\ndoing the analysis of it.\n\n551\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.800\nHere the measurements is\ntime spent on the incident.\n\n552\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.570\nNotice how this is being fed here.\n\n553\n00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.250\nTime spent on the incident by first\nlevel and second level support and\n\n554\n00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.099\nthey average salary.\n\n555\n00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.020\nWow, we're getting some\npretty nuanced data here.\n\n556\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.030\nThe measurement is based on\nsome saddlery extrapolation.\n\n557\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.550\nIf the service desk technician\nmakes x dollars and hour, and\n\n558\n00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.200\nhe spends 0.25 hours on this,\n\n559\n00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.700\nyou're starting to develop a cost\nper incident potentially, right?\n\n560\n00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.780\nTime spent on problem management,\nthat's a second level sport.\n\n561\n00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.240\nHow long do we spend on this?\n\n562\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.810\nTraining first level around workarounds.\n\n563\n00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.850\nIt costs money.\n\n564\n00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.720\nIt costs time I guess I should say.\n\n565\n00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.270\nTo work, churn through these incidents.\n\n566\n00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.660\nAnd if you have 80 incidents\nper printer restart, or\n\n567\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.010\nprinter queue fixes, whatever it might be,\nif you have 50 of those a day.\n\n568\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.640\nDo the math on how many 50 is, right,\nand how much you need to reduce those.\n\n569\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:35.130\nSo maybe the KPI becomes a 20%\nreduction in the number of incidents.\n\n570\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.155\nIt also could be on that side,\n\n571\n00:28:37.155 --> 00:28:42.428\nsee how different KPIs could support\nthat overarching reduce IT cost Right.\n\n572\n00:28:42.428 --> 00:28:47.345\nSo, you can slice this pie many\ndifferent ways in terms of measurement,\n\n573\n00:28:47.345 --> 00:28:49.630\nand in terms of reporting.\n\n574\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:53.030\nThey need to be consistent,\nrecognizable, and transparent.\n\n575\n00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.530\nBasically, you need to recognize\nthat it's a direct interaction\n\n576\n00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.500\nwith the particular\ncritical success factor.\n\n577\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.090\nA direct link between.\n\n578\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.850\nAnd you'll have a nice pie too.\n\n579\n00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:02.700\n&gt;&gt; And a good pie.\n\n580\n00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.200\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n581\n00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.128\nI like this, value added report it\njust mentioned it, a good segway here.\n\n582\n00:29:09.128 --> 00:29:14.042\nAny measurement framework,\nwhatever the side side to measure,\n\n583\n00:29:14.042 --> 00:29:19.666\nit needs to lead to value added reporting,\nI think I might put a little hyphen there,\n\n584\n00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:24.450\nvalue added reporting, in other\nwords the reporting Leads to action.\n\n585\n00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.750\nYour value added,\n\n586\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.750\nyou're adding value by being able\nto lead to appropriate response.\n\n587\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.780\nSo, any reporting, any measurement\nframework that you decide to put together\n\n588\n00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.020\nneeds to lead to value added reporting.\n\n589\n00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.760\nI'll go back to an example I\nmentioned in an earlier episode.\n\n590\n00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.470\nIt it possible for you to have all green\nmetrics and a dissatisfied customer.\n\n591\n00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.210\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n592\n00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.610\n&gt;&gt; So when you come to that service review\nmeeting with this report that says, hey,\n\n593\n00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:50.610\nwhat are you complaining about?\n\n594\n00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:54.715\nYou're absolutely not adding value,\nyou're just reporting the green.\n\n595\n00:29:54.715 --> 00:30:00.245\nValue added would be able to\naction a particular item.\n\n596\n00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:03.645\nSo, in that particular meeting where you\ndiscover the customer is dissatisfied.\n\n597\n00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:05.005\nWhat metrics were missing?\n\n598\n00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:09.265\nHow are we missing\nthe satisfaction quotient here,\n\n599\n00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.815\nin that particular metrics things.\n\n600\n00:30:10.815 --> 00:30:12.795\nSo you're talking about\ndefining what you want to do,\n\n601\n00:30:12.795 --> 00:30:16.335\nbuild your measurements, come up\nwith the appropriate responses, and\n\n602\n00:30:16.335 --> 00:30:20.130\nhave appropriate roles and\nresponsibilities to respond.\n\n603\n00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.870\nTo the given metrics.\n\n604\n00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.120\nWho gets this data who processes it,\nwho responds to it,\n\n605\n00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.310\nis what we talk about there.\n\n606\n00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.380\nAll right, now,\nhere we are really regarding\n\n607\n00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:35.310\nschematic of framework this would have\nto be an example of a high level goal\n\n608\n00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.470\nwhich has manage availability and\nreliability of a service.\n\n609\n00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.040\nThe goal is to have good management\nof availability and reliability.\n\n610\n00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.405\nThe KPI for that particular goal is\na percentage improvement in overall\n\n611\n00:30:46.405 --> 00:30:49.037\nend-to-end availability of services.\n\n612\n00:30:49.037 --> 00:30:56.060\nNice high-level option here, the KPI\ncategory is for value and for quality.\n\n613\n00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.495\nThe quality of services is going\nto drive up the value of service.\n\n614\n00:30:59.495 --> 00:31:00.806\nTrying to make the connections there.\n\n615\n00:31:00.806 --> 00:31:06.950\nRight, the measurement target and\nhow and who.\n\n616\n00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:11.540\nThis is basically an example to the CSI\nregister with the improvement opportunity\n\n617\n00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.710\nis shown and the scope of it is shown and\nyou're signing ownership of it as well\n\n618\n00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.880\nas we've mentioned before,\nthis is continuous.\n\n619\n00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.921\nThe seven step process is a cycle,\nit goes rond the bend, based\n\n620\n00:31:26.921 --> 00:31:32.500\non a cycle and you continually and\ngradually improve things.\n\n621\n00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.400\nSo, as this plays on our exam and\nat the back of our office,\n\n622\n00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.350\ndon't just jump to the golden goose\nsolution do some gradual improvements.\n\n623\n00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.140\nWork your way toward the end goal.\n\n624\n00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.718\nIt is totally appropriate\nin the actual framework.\n\n625\n00:31:46.718 --> 00:31:49.197\nGet your quick wins,\nconsolidate those wins and\n\n626\n00:31:49.197 --> 00:31:51.562\nmove on to another\nimprovement opportunity.\n\n627\n00:31:51.562 --> 00:31:53.517\nRinse and repeat.\n\n628\n00:31:53.517 --> 00:31:55.738\nOver and over, okay?\n\n629\n00:31:55.738 --> 00:32:00.490\nAnd finally a little bit of\nexamination of monitoring and control.\n\n630\n00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.020\nThis idea of open-loop systems and\nclosed-loop systems.\n\n631\n00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:10.490\nOpen-loop systems give you the basis for\nperforming specific activities, right?\n\n632\n00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.060\nBut they are independent of anyone else.\n\n633\n00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.530\nClosed loop means, they're interacting\nwith each other at given time, right?\n\n634\n00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.550\nSo what you're trying to\nestablish here is a cycle\n\n635\n00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.520\nthat's effectively a closed looped\nsystem where they're inter reactive.\n\n636\n00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.710\nThey're not so independent, right?\n\n637\n00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.590\nSo monitoring control, how you set up\nyour monitoring of your measurements, and\n\n638\n00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:36.280\nthen follow through with appropriate\nactions is more of a closed loop, right?\n\n639\n00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.960\nIt just keeps going where open loop\nis the data continues to flow.\n\n640\n00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.630\nRight so trying to build these in.\n\n641\n00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.614\nHere's a complex control loop with\nlots of things being concerned.\n\n642\n00:32:47.614 --> 00:32:52.487\nWhat your norm is is what you're trying\nto achieve on an ongoing basis or\n\n643\n00:32:52.487 --> 00:32:55.505\nwhat you are achieving\non an ongoing basis.\n\n644\n00:32:55.505 --> 00:32:59.555\nAnd then a less IT service\nmanagement deals with\n\n645\n00:32:59.555 --> 00:33:03.310\nhow effective are you at service strategy?\n\n646\n00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.370\nHow effective are you at service design?\n\n647\n00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.460\nHow that plays down through\nthe organization and\n\n648\n00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.850\nthen the feedback loops\nfrom the various processes.\n\n649\n00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.840\nLet me give you an example,\na real-life example.\n\n650\n00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:20.460\nIf, in service operations, you discover\nthat the reason for most of your major\n\n651\n00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:27.280\noutages is related to architectural\nproblems within the application.\n\n652\n00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.380\nBetween the application and the database,\nbetween the server and the database.\n\n653\n00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.520\nBetween the database and\nthe network, right?\n\n654\n00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.240\nIf you discern through your good problem\nanalysis that through operational data,\n\n655\n00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.640\nthat most outages are because\nof architectural failures.\n\n656\n00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.650\nThen where are you going to\ngo to try to solve this, and\n\n657\n00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.930\nprevent this from happening again?\n\n658\n00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.070\nService design,\ncuz that's where architecture happens.\n\n659\n00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.870\nThat's where you build\nthe architecture of things out.\n\n660\n00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.620\nMaybe you're also going to service\ntransition where things are tested and\n\n661\n00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.750\nvalidated to be working appropriately.\n\n662\n00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:05.000\nSo, maybe you turn your\nattention to service transition.\n\n663\n00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.510\nSo here you have an operational\nfeedback loop that says,\n\n664\n00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.500\nwow we have lots of failures here.\n\n665\n00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.670\nWe've done the root cause analysis of\nthese hundred failures we've had in\n\n666\n00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:19.110\nthe last six months, and 60% of them,\nthe heaviest hitter by far,\n\n667\n00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:22.400\nis architectural related to databases and\nservers.\n\n668\n00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.260\nOkay, let's work about this design issue.\n\n669\n00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.000\nHow is that weak?\n\n670\n00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.130\nIs it weak in transition, or\nis it weak in service design?\n\n671\n00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.900\nTalk about a technical issue there.\n\n672\n00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.980\nPerhaps it's process related.\n\n673\n00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.470\nPerhaps the reason for\n\n674\n00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:40.390\nfailures, outages may be 60% of them\nare caused because change management\n\n675\n00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.050\nintroduced us something that's quirky,\nright, and not fully tested.\n\n676\n00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.140\nSo again, you know where to look.\n\n677\n00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.427\nJust wanna talk about closed loops,\nfinding and\n\n678\n00:34:47.427 --> 00:34:51.900\nnot closing off these loops and\nmaking it happen, working through those.\n\n679\n00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.058\n&gt;&gt; It's all a cycle.\n\n680\n00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:54.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n681\n00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.620\nSo also, closely related to\nmonitoring is event management.\n\n682\n00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:04.030\nWe talked about event management a little\nearlier in that it is a detective process,\n\n683\n00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.370\nit's trying to detect\nthings early enough so\n\n684\n00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.870\nthat you can get in front of\npotential problems, right?\n\n685\n00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.170\nSo as good as your event\nmanagement tool sets are,\n\n686\n00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.400\ncould be as good as your response rate.\n\n687\n00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.860\nThey feed each other.\n\n688\n00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.850\nEvent management can detect but\nare you there to respond, right?\n\n689\n00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:28.790\nSo very key to perhaps focusing on\nan improvement idea for all of your\n\n690\n00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.210\ninfrastructure and all your services would\nbe to have effective event management.\n\n691\n00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:37.850\nThe automatic detection of potential\nfailures and potential weaknesses, right?\n\n692\n00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.945\nAll right, all right, the importance\nof measurement, can't overstate it.\n\n693\n00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:46.665\nIt's fundamental to IT service management.\n\n694\n00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:49.775\nIt's fundamental to continue\nservice improvement.\n\n695\n00:35:49.775 --> 00:35:51.595\nIt's fundamental to the way you operate.\n\n696\n00:35:51.595 --> 00:35:55.683\nIt becomes the cultural way that\nyou deal with the issues at work.\n\n697\n00:35:55.683 --> 00:36:00.875\nNo longer do you respond to rumors or\nthe squeakiest wheel,\n\n698\n00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:06.310\nyou respond to data pointers,\nspecific input by specific factors.\n\n699\n00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.780\nTo reinforce some of this learning,\n\n700\n00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.920\nthere's a good exercise here called\nDesigning Measurement Methods.\n\n701\n00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.450\nIt's a really good one.\n\n702\n00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.955\nIt's available for you, for\nyour self-study needs, and\n\n703\n00:36:16.955 --> 00:36:19.698\nthe episode files link,\ngo inside that link.\n\n704\n00:36:19.698 --> 00:36:22.720\nDownload this activity,\nwork through this activity.\n\n705\n00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.980\nIf you have any questions about it or any\nother of the subject matter in this course\n\n706\n00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.220\nor any of the other courses,\ncome to the forum, find experts there.\n\n707\n00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:36.510\nFind other students and peers there,\ndiscuss it, learn, and carry on.\n\n708\n00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.330\nGood luck.\n\n709\n00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.790\n&gt;&gt; Without data, it's just whining.\n\n710\n00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:39.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n711\n00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.850\n&gt;&gt; Terry, great job as usual.\n\n712\n00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.220\nThe importance of measurement,\nthere are so much in the libraries so\n\n713\n00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.320\nmany video to watch,\nwatch them all you will be glad you did.\n\n714\n00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.940\nAnd thank you for watching

00:00:08.798\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:12.322\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.956\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for choosing\nITProTV helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:20.622\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with ITIL MALC.\n\n7\n00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:23.905\nAnd we are going to dive into\nimplementing and improving ITSM with,\n\n8\n00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:27.090\nyou know him you love him,\nTerry Decker, right over there.\n\n9\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.120\nGood to see you again sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be back, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.660\nAs always, it's a pleasure to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.689\nAnd as Zach said, we are going to be\nlooking at some of the improvement\n\n13\n00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:37.710\nmethodologies you can take toward\nmanaging across the lifecycle.\n\n14\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.970\nHere we are at this again, this 5,000 foot\nview looking at an entire organization,\n\n15\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.820\nlooking at the capabilities in\nthe IT service management sphere and\n\n16\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.950\nsaying what should we do and how should\nwe do it and go about making decisions.\n\n17\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.360\nThat's gonna be a big part\nof your exam challenge.\n\n18\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.130\nIt's also the big part of your challenge\nback at the office is coming up with\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.660\nthe appropriate vision and scope of\nwhat it is you're trying to accomplish.\n\n20\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.767\nSo as you look here at the graphic,\nthe CSI approach,\n\n21\n00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:07.533\nthe Continual Service Improvement\napproach,\n\n22\n00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.157\nis the approach that can\nserve you very well,\n\n23\n00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:14.744\nwhether the change is a major change or\nwhether the change is something small.\n\n24\n00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:18.134\nThe improvement is something\nthat can be project based,\n\n25\n00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:20.897\nit's gonna happen over\nthe next three years.\n\n26\n00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:23.940\nIt can be something you're going to\ndo over the next three weeks, right.\n\n27\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.310\nThis approach works in both situations,\nmacro and micro.\n\n28\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.195\nSo have a look at this.\n\n29\n00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:32.920\nYou're familiar with it from past courses.\n\n30\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.380\nWe reinforced it in just about\nevery intermediate course\n\n31\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.100\nthat you start with a vision as to why\nyou even care about making this change or\n\n32\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.610\nmaking this movement.\n\n33\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.250\nNow as you take the exam you're gonna\nbe looking at business opportunities.\n\n34\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.146\nThe business is trying to move somewhere.\n\n35\n00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:51.953\nAnd maybe that's what's motivating you as\nan IT practitioner or a service management\n\n36\n00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:55.619\npractitioner to make some adjustments to\nyour service management capabilities.\n\n37\n00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.010\nIt is because the company\nis moving somewhere.\n\n38\n00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.910\nOr maybe you've done a self-assessment,\nand you found that you're weak on\n\n39\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.955\nsomething and you want to make\na sell to the business partners.\n\n40\n00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:10.475\nTo say, hey we would be well\nserved if we had an ITSM\n\n41\n00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:13.725\nsuite of tools and\nhere's what kind of value it would bring.\n\n42\n00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:17.135\nCan you help us,\ncan you get behind us on this effort?\n\n43\n00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:20.085\nSo again,\nstarting with the vision as to why we care\n\n44\n00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:22.350\nreally means starting with the business.\n\n45\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.220\nGetting them to care, understanding\nwhat pushes their buttons, or\n\n46\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.838\nwhat excites them, or\nwhat they're trying to accomplish.\n\n47\n00:02:28.838 --> 00:02:33.220\n&gt;&gt; And Terry, just from my own little\nbrain here, ITSM is IT Service Management.\n\n48\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for the reminder.\n\n49\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.010\nAbsolutely, IT Service Management.\n\n50\n00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.330\nWhich is the best practice\nthat ITIL brings forth, right?\n\n51\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.130\nIt's a practice for IT service management.\n\n52\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.975\nSo again,\nwithout having going slow through this,\n\n53\n00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:49.330\nI want to just make sure that\nyou always go slow as well.\n\n54\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470\nWhen you are on the exam and\nyour are evaluating what the five\n\n55\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.640\npoint answer might be or\nthe three point answer might be.\n\n56\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.700\nOften times you might be\nattracted by an answer that\n\n57\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.130\nkind of jumps to the solution you kind of\nalready formulated in your head, right?\n\n58\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.230\nAnd I understand that's human nature.\n\n59\n00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.290\nYeah, that's where I would be going.\n\n60\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.080\nAnd you'll see an answer that says yeah,\nlet's go there, right?\n\n61\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.700\nBut ITIL loves, the exam makers at\nITIL love to reinforce the idea\n\n62\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.510\nof looking before you go and decide.\n\n63\n00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.820\nSo take a pause back, right?\n\n64\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.230\nMake sure that the steps\nyou're following are following\n\n65\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930\nthe basic premise of\nwhat's the business focus?\n\n66\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.540\nIs the business involved in this decision?\n\n67\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.490\nAre they a stakeholder we've\nmanaged appropriately and\n\n68\n00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.520\ndo we fully understand what they need?\n\n69\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.690\nIf that has been covered by the scenario\nor through the case study and\n\n70\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.630\nit's absolutely clear, then okay,\nyou can miss that step and\n\n71\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.180\nyou can move on to the next\nstep about baseline, right?\n\n72\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.660\nBaseline is knowing where you are now,\nhow well you are performing right now.\n\n73\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.860\nThis is not just an opinion.\n\n74\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.486\nThis should be some sort of\nmeasured approach, objective view.\n\n75\n00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:59.640\nWhether it's the objective view of how\nmature you are at a given process or\n\n76\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.272\nan objective view of how well that\nprocess is actually performing,\n\n77\n00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.620\nyou're gonna have some metrics\nto show you that, right.\n\n78\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.460\nAnd once you know what the vision is and\n\n79\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.470\nhave an idea of where you are right now,\nyou can then begin to formulate\n\n80\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.340\nmovement toward the goal of where\nyou're trying to get to, right.\n\n81\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.040\nThat's when you can come up with\nsome priorities and plans and\n\n82\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.160\nassess your current capabilities or\nanalyze those in\n\n83\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.940\na meaningful way for the next step which\nwould be to implement the plan, right?\n\n84\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.029\nHow do we get there is one thing, right?\n\n85\n00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:35.130\nComing up with that plan and\n\n86\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.400\nthen you assess, after the implementation\nof that plan, did you get there.\n\n87\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.640\nOf course you need to keep momentum\ngoing or ask the next question.\n\n88\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.340\nHow is it that we would make sure that we\ndon't fall backwards in this improvement,\n\n89\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.220\nhow can we solidify these gains and\nensure ongoing success?\n\n90\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.680\nNotice it's cyclical too,\nthat's gradual and\n\n91\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.900\ncontinual improvements in play in here.\n\n92\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.640\nThis approach, again, whether it's for\nbig things or small things,\n\n93\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.800\nwill serve you well back at the office.\n\n94\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.510\nIt'll serve you very\nwell on the exam as well.\n\n95\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.090\n&gt;&gt; So an analysis of data before\ntaking the action is important.\n\n96\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.990\n&gt;&gt; And understanding the vision as\nto even why we even care about it.\n\n97\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.291\nThat's even the fundamental one and\n\n98\n00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:16.891\nthen understanding the data and\nbe on that, Zach.\n\n99\n00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:20.260\nBut even why we even care,\nwhy do we want to try to do something?\n\n100\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.161\nAnd that something needs to have\nsome sort of customer value or\n\n101\n00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:28.240\nbusiness outcome in mind.\n\n102\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.440\nOf course there's external internal\ndrivers that affect our vision,\n\n103\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.420\nright, that motivate us,\nthat perhaps hamper us in some ways.\n\n104\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.650\nMaybe we have some constraints\ndue to some external factors.\n\n105\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.940\nMaybe it's the external factors that\nis moving us toward the change.\n\n106\n00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.940\nIf you work, again,\nthe example I've used in other episodes.\n\n107\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.761\nIf you were at Barnes &amp; Noble about\nthe time Amazon.com started gaining some\n\n108\n00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:55.160\nmomentum in the sale of books, you might\nthink, well, what are we gonna do?\n\n109\n00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.970\nAs a organization,\nhow are we gonna continue to survive?\n\n110\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.360\nNow we're not an online store, we're\na book, brick, and mortar with nice chairs\n\n111\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.490\nand wood paneled walls and\ngood coffee on the corner, right?\n\n112\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.133\nThat's a very good business model for\nthem, it served them well.\n\n113\n00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:11.700\nBut we have this real big competitor over\n\n114\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.013\nhere that could cause some pain to\nour bottom line and market share.\n\n115\n00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:16.857\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n116\n00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:19.810\nAnd we kinda saw the response\nwhat Barnes &amp; Noble did.\n\n117\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.974\nAnd where Barnes &amp; Noble as a business\nhad to reorient towards some electronic\n\n118\n00:06:24.974 --> 00:06:30.120\nmedia and some toward electronic sales\nas well as the NOOK reader, right?\n\n119\n00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.050\nAs they went in that direction,\nIT was there to respond.\n\n120\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.020\nAnd these are IT services that\nare helping this business survive.\n\n121\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:46.040\nSo the external factors there was the\ncompetition was a danger to the business.\n\n122\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.250\nSo what are we gonna do to respond?\n\n123\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.716\nWell, Barnes &amp; Noble came\nup with a response, right?\n\n124\n00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:51.020\nAnd they still have the brick and mortar,\n\n125\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.668\nthey're still distinguishing\nthemselves there.\n\n126\n00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:56.191\nThey still have cushy chairs and a nice\nwarm cup of coffee in the corner, right?\n\n127\n00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:57.920\nAnd it's still a pleasurable experience.\n\n128\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.730\nSo they haven't abandoned that\npart of their business model.\n\n129\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.307\nThey just adapted to that and\nIT was there being pushed.\n\n130\n00:07:05.307 --> 00:07:07.904\nYou can call that external factor,\nwell it certainly became one.\n\n131\n00:07:07.904 --> 00:07:10.572\nBecause that IT organization\nhad to do something different\n\n132\n00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:12.820\nto support that business direction.\n\n133\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.290\nAs you look at the case study for the\nsample paper a little bit later, when you\n\n134\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.170\nlook at that you're gonna find that that's\nalso some of the dynamics playing on.\n\n135\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.740\nThe business,\ncompetitive nature of the business.\n\n136\n00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.630\nIt's a banking organization.\n\n137\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.080\nMergers and acquisitions, the potential\nfor being beat out by a customer.\n\n138\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.840\nAlmost a feeding frenzy to go and\nacquire other banks and\n\n139\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.120\ngrow and get your portfolio up and\nexpand services in the IT arena.\n\n140\n00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.334\nOnline banking and being able to cash or\ncheck on your phone,\n\n141\n00:07:42.334 --> 00:07:45.561\nthose kinds of things, or\ndeposit your check on your phone.\n\n142\n00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:50.121\nThe various things that drive the banking\nindustry are in play in that case study,\n\n143\n00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.312\nand you can consider those\nexternal as well as internal.\n\n144\n00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:56.453\nWhat's the business trying to do?\n\n145\n00:07:56.453 --> 00:08:01.070\nAnd as you look at yourself internally,\nhow are you positioned to respond to that?\n\n146\n00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.596\nDo you have a flexible model of service\nmanagement and service delivery?\n\n147\n00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:11.460\nIs it pretty strict and\nnot able to go with the flow?\n\n148\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.711\nSo as you analyze your own internal\ncapabilities, you're going to find\n\n149\n00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:19.555\nsome of those that are good and\nsome of those that aren't so good.\n\n150\n00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:22.937\nAcademically speaking, when you're\nreading through the case study,\n\n151\n00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:26.087\nyou're going to be focusing on\nwhat's strong and what's weak,\n\n152\n00:08:26.087 --> 00:08:28.340\nthe same thing you would\ndo back at the office.\n\n153\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.010\nWhere are we strong?\n\n154\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.653\nLet's use that strength and\n\n155\n00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:34.290\nleverage that strength to\nimprove where you're weak, okay.\n\n156\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:43.420\nSo taking a life cycle approach,\nif you will, to managing service strategy.\n\n157\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.805\nNow, what I mean by that is we\nknow service strategy is one of\n\n158\n00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.895\nthe stages in the life cycle of a service.\n\n159\n00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:54.219\nAnd when you see this, and we've seen\nthat in other intermediate classes.\n\n160\n00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:58.218\nWhen you say following a life cycle\napproach to implementing something,\n\n161\n00:08:58.218 --> 00:09:01.970\nyou're effectively saying you're\ngonna start with why do we care?\n\n162\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.685\nWhat's the strategy?\n\n163\n00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.330\nAnd then you're gonna come\nup with an effective design.\n\n164\n00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.326\nYou need to plan the transition\nof this change, right.\n\n165\n00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:12.190\nAnd then you need to bring\nthe change to life, right.\n\n166\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.600\nWhich is what we talk about when we\ntalk about bringing a service into life.\n\n167\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.133\nWell, you can do this by also\nbringing a strategy to life, right.\n\n168\n00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:23.209\nCome up with the appropriate strategy\nof how you want to make this happen.\n\n169\n00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:24.817\nCome up with an appropriate design.\n\n170\n00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:30.503\nAppropriate transition plan,\nultimately testing and validating it,\n\n171\n00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.492\nmaking sure it's fit for purpose.\n\n172\n00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:35.179\nJust as you would for a service,\nyou can also do that for\n\n173\n00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:37.560\na strategic improvement, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.190\nIn this example here.\n\n175\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.905\nUnderstanding where you currently are.\n\n176\n00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:43.960\nSeen that before, the baseline, right.\n\n177\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.671\nWhere we wanna be, the target state.\n\n178\n00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:49.463\nSo we know where we are,\nwhere do we wanna be, and by when?\n\n179\n00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:53.811\nAnd then you're managing the gap,\nright, between those.\n\n180\n00:09:53.811 --> 00:09:55.725\nYou might need to bring a project in play.\n\n181\n00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:58.641\nIf you wanna would adopt ITIL,\nit's not trivial thing.\n\n182\n00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:00.617\nSo you bring a project into play.\n\n183\n00:10:00.617 --> 00:10:03.387\nSo now you get the project\ndeliverables understood, and\n\n184\n00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:05.994\nthe project scope estimations and\nconsolidations.\n\n185\n00:10:05.994 --> 00:10:10.123\nAnd then you set this out within\na framework of a program of work,\n\n186\n00:10:10.123 --> 00:10:14.268\na road map if you will,\nof when you're gonna do what and by when.\n\n187\n00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:19.438\nSo looking at managing across the life\ncycle, again, the 5,000 foot view,\n\n188\n00:10:19.438 --> 00:10:23.373\nyou can take a very methodical\napproach to the CSI approach.\n\n189\n00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:27.540\nYou can take a life cycle approach,\nwhere you plan, then design,\n\n190\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.849\nthen transition,\nbefore bringing it into operations, right.\n\n191\n00:10:32.849 --> 00:10:34.240\nSo here comes the design piece.\n\n192\n00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:40.615\nSo you answer all the questions,\nyou try to do as holistic as you can about\n\n193\n00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:46.040\nunderstanding what the factors are for\nbringing this new strategy to life.\n\n194\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.023\nSo the same approach that we have kinda\ninfused you with about the service\n\n195\n00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:54.861\nstrategy, or I'm sorry,\nabout service management,\n\n196\n00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:58.553\ncan be brought to strategy management,\nif you will.\n\n197\n00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:00.786\nA strategy has a life cycle, too, okay.\n\n198\n00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:06.910\nThen moving on through, again,\nimplementation for the transition.\n\n199\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.910\nYou're gonna develop the right skill sets.\n\n200\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.290\nYou're going to train the right\npeople at the right time.\n\n201\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.697\nYou're going to make sure\nthat your tools are working.\n\n202\n00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:18.532\nYou're gonna validate that\nthe people can use the tools, right.\n\n203\n00:11:18.532 --> 00:11:22.540\nAnd as you're implementing these new\nstrategies for IT service management,\n\n204\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.423\nthe synergies between your tools and\n\n205\n00:11:24.423 --> 00:11:27.350\nyour processes is gonna have\nto be tweaked here and there.\n\n206\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.490\nSo how are you gonna validate those\nlittle tweaks to make sure they work?\n\n207\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.541\nAnd then, of course,\nyou eventually deploy.\n\n208\n00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.363\nSay, okay, we're gonna go live with\na new change management process.\n\n209\n00:11:35.363 --> 00:11:39.480\nOr we're gonna go live with a new\navailability management process.\n\n210\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.894\nHere's the tool set, here's the process,\nhere are the practitioners.\n\n211\n00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:45.810\nWe've tested it all, go live with it.\n\n212\n00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.190\nJust as you would a service, including\nreviewing after implementation, all right.\n\n213\n00:11:53.163 --> 00:11:57.670\nSo, of course, once you're in operations,\nyou need to keep score, right.\n\n214\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.560\nMonitor how are you doing?\n\n215\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.700\nWhat are your measurements telling\nyou about this new thing you've done?\n\n216\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.870\nThis new thing you've done is supposed\nto have provided some sort of value.\n\n217\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.930\nAre we getting that value, right?\n\n218\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.312\nSo that post launch, if you will,\n\n219\n00:12:11.312 --> 00:12:15.276\nassessment of how well you're\ndoing is also important.\n\n220\n00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:20.109\nIt validates in operation that the value\nthat you intended is being delivered.\n\n221\n00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:24.890\nIt also gives you the indications of\nwhere, if it's not being fully delivered,\n\n222\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.422\nhow you can shore up those shortfalls, and\n\n223\n00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:31.234\nmake sure that you're optimizing\nacross operations, right.\n\n224\n00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:35.240\nAnd, of course, CSI,\nalways present, right.\n\n225\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.060\nI'm just basically give you a CSI\napproach to this whole idea.\n\n226\n00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:47.370\nNow, considering metrics and\ndoing a SWOT analysis of your metrics.\n\n227\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:51.945\nSWOT, remember, it means strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities and threats.\n\n228\n00:12:51.945 --> 00:12:55.662\nAnd sitting down and looking at where\nyou're strong, where you're weak,\n\n229\n00:12:55.662 --> 00:12:57.357\nthat's an internal assessment.\n\n230\n00:12:57.357 --> 00:13:00.893\nAnd then you're looking at\nthe external things with, well,\n\n231\n00:13:00.893 --> 00:13:04.975\nwhat opportunities do you have to be\nmore successful for the business?\n\n232\n00:13:04.975 --> 00:13:09.221\nAnd what threats do you have that\ncould hinder you from providing for\n\n233\n00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.722\nthe business, right.\n\n234\n00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:13.722\nSo you can do a SWOT analysis\nat a corporate level,\n\n235\n00:13:13.722 --> 00:13:16.370\nwhich is highly recommended, right.\n\n236\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.620\nHow's the business doing?\n\n237\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.430\nAgain, imagine what Barnes and\nNoble was doing.\n\n238\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.273\nWell, we're strong with our\ncushy chairs and hot coffee.\n\n239\n00:13:22.273 --> 00:13:25.909\nBut we're kinda weak on the electronic\npart of it, the business-\n\n240\n00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:26.599\n&gt;&gt; On the Internet part.\n\n241\n00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:27.779\n&gt;&gt; On the Internet part, right.\n\n242\n00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:29.057\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, I mean, again,\n\n243\n00:13:29.057 --> 00:13:30.440\nkinda oversimplifying that.\n\n244\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.380\nBut, as an example, they had strengths,\nand they also had some weaknesses.\n\n245\n00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.102\nAnd then their opportunities were we\ncould increase market share if we had\n\n246\n00:13:38.102 --> 00:13:43.110\nan e-learning, or I'm sorry,\nan electronic methodology.\n\n247\n00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.249\nThe threats are Amazon is gonna\nkick our butt if we don't change,\n\n248\n00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:47.227\nthat sort of thing.\n\n249\n00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:49.953\nSo you get the idea is that\nthere's a business SWOT.\n\n250\n00:13:49.953 --> 00:13:54.689\nAnd then you can analyze yourself as\nan internal organization, as an IT service\n\n251\n00:13:54.689 --> 00:14:00.790\nprovider, and assess your own strengths\nand weaknesses, opportunities and threats.\n\n252\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.024\nI highly recommend, we'll get into a SWOT\na little bit later when we talk about\n\n253\n00:14:04.024 --> 00:14:05.357\nbreaking down this case study.\n\n254\n00:14:05.357 --> 00:14:09.330\nBut, fundamentally, what the SWOT is\ngiving you is kinda the lay of the land.\n\n255\n00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.788\nIt's a brainstorm, right,\nget together with a few people.\n\n256\n00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:17.980\nIf you're preparing for the exam,\nperhaps, it's a lone wolf type operation.\n\n257\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.756\nBut it's a great\nbrainstorming opportunity.\n\n258\n00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:27.970\nLook at yourself, evaluate yourself, and\nsee where you can move forward, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.773\nSome of the common pitfalls of a SWOT\nanalysis is that you're not sure\n\n260\n00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:34.310\nwhat the end state is.\n\n261\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.306\nAnd what I mean by this is the tool,\ncalled a SWOT analysis,\n\n262\n00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:43.656\nis intended to compare your strengths and\nweaknesses to a given goal, right.\n\n263\n00:14:43.656 --> 00:14:47.330\nLet's take that Barnes and\nNoble business SWOT.\n\n264\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.583\nTheir given goal was market share for\nselling of books and CDs, perhaps.\n\n265\n00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:53.800\nJust hypothetically speaking here, right.\n\n266\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.653\nThey sell books, they sell music, right.\n\n267\n00:14:56.653 --> 00:15:01.388\nAnd that's what drives\nthe profits of this organization.\n\n268\n00:15:01.388 --> 00:15:04.925\nSo if you look at the SWOT\nanalysis of that business,\n\n269\n00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:11.260\nthey may be looking at what are our\nstrengths in terms of market share?\n\n270\n00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.600\nThe goal being market share, right.\n\n271\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.645\nNow later one,\n\n272\n00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:21.640\nthe IT organization may look at what\nis our strength related to e-commerce?\n\n273\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.270\nWhat are weaknesses related to e-commerce,\nright?\n\n274\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.481\nIs it infrastructure, is it technology,\nis it capabilities, etc?\n\n275\n00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:31.677\nSo the end state,\n\n276\n00:15:31.677 --> 00:15:36.305\nwhat you're comparing your strength to or\nfor, is an important aspect.\n\n277\n00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:40.695\nSo a pitfall of a SWOT is you\ndon't just say how am I doing?\n\n278\n00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:44.848\nIt's how are you doing in relationship\nto a specific objective or\n\n279\n00:15:44.848 --> 00:15:46.669\na specific concept, okay.\n\n280\n00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:49.588\nSo don't forget that aspect of it.\n\n281\n00:15:49.588 --> 00:15:54.864\nAnother pitfall is Confusing opportunities\nwith defects that you have or\n\n282\n00:15:54.864 --> 00:15:57.270\nweaknesses that you have.\n\n283\n00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.650\nNow I appreciate how this could happen.\n\n284\n00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.620\nIf you have a weakness,\nyou have an opportunity to improve, right?\n\n285\n00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.209\nSo I can see the direct connection\nbetween the W and the O, if you will.\n\n286\n00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:08.210\nYou could describe a weakness.\n\n287\n00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.048\nLet's take that Barnes &amp; Noble example,\nwe are weak at e-commerce, right?\n\n288\n00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:13.400\nWe don't have the scale, right?\n\n289\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.350\nAnd then the opportunity, well,\nlet's increase our e-commerce or\n\n290\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.020\nlet's increase our scale.\n\n291\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.080\nBut strengths and weaknesses are internal\nself assessments of yourself.\n\n292\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.620\nOpportunities and threats\nare rendered in the external factors.\n\n293\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.740\nMove the business somewhere,\nmake more money, that's the opportunity.\n\n294\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.449\nMake more money through e-commerce, right?\n\n295\n00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:38.294\nSo you have weakness?\n\n296\n00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:41.884\nYeah, which you also have an opportunity\nto make more money through e-commerce,\n\n297\n00:16:41.884 --> 00:16:43.127\nthat sort of a thing, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:44.960\nAnd those threats are also external.\n\n299\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.510\nMixing up your weaknesses\nwith the threats.\n\n300\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.620\nAgain, threats are external.\n\n301\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.291\nWeaknesses, you're just weak at it.\n\n302\n00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:56.260\nThreats are related to what would happen\nif that weakness is not shored up.\n\n303\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.110\nYou'll lose market share,\nyou'll lose sales.\n\n304\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.473\nOr the competition will gain market share,\nwe won't.\n\n305\n00:17:01.473 --> 00:17:02.980\nAll right, that sort of stuff.\n\n306\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.840\nSo we'll have a little\nreview of a SWOT later on.\n\n307\n00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.700\nThe little question mark down here\nsuggesting that you conduct a SWOT\n\n308\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.500\nanalysis for the case study.\n\n309\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.230\nI highly recommend that you do that.\n\n310\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.640\nYou'll get to know\nthe case study very well.\n\n311\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.480\nWe have a case study review\nepisode coming up soon\n\n312\n00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.890\nthat will dive into the details\nof that particular factor.\n\n313\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.360\nNow, this idea of assessments and\nthe gap, right?\n\n314\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.445\nSo the gap analysis is looking\nat where you want to be and\n\n315\n00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:32.930\nwhere you currently are.\n\n316\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.410\nThat's the delta, if you will,\nthe gap that you're trying to fill.\n\n317\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.170\nGap analysis is not intended\nto be any magical term here,\n\n318\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.030\nit's just the difference\nbetween where you are and\n\n319\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.460\nwhere you wanna be,\nthat gap in-between, right?\n\n320\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.440\nSo that gap analysis is saying,\nwell, how can we bridge this gap?\n\n321\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.540\nWe are currently at a market\nshare of this but we're losing,\n\n322\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.040\nwe're trending down,\nthat's a business type thing.\n\n323\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.570\nIn the internal IT organization,\n\n324\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.890\nyou might be looking at, right now we're\nnot very flexible, it takes us a long time\n\n325\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.680\nto design a service or to design something\nnew, we have to be better at it, right?\n\n326\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.580\nSo, maybe the idea is, design coordination\nwill drive those improvements through\n\n327\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.600\nthe service design stage.\n\n328\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.141\nSo, again, you are analyzing the data and\nfinding out where the weaknesses are.\n\n329\n00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:20.188\nAnd thought,\n\n330\n00:18:20.188 --> 00:18:25.861\nmaybe the way we can bridge this gap is\nby introducing a streamline process and\n\n331\n00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:30.677\nnot just guessing and reinventing\nthe wheel every time etc., okay?\n\n332\n00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:35.594\nSo, as you can see there, gap analysis can\nbe conducted from different perspective,\n\n333\n00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:37.910\nthe organizational perspective.\n\n334\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.960\nThe gap could be in the number\nof trained DBAs you have.\n\n335\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.480\nYou can't be effective at database\nmanagement without the right skill set,\n\n336\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.800\nit could be organizational, as an example.\n\n337\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.340\nThe business direction, or the business\nprocesses, what's the gap between those?\n\n338\n00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.190\nAnd, of course,\n\n339\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.870\ntalking about your own internal\nissues with information technology.\n\n340\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.972\nSo, as you take on that case study,\nin a few minutes we'll get on to that one.\n\n341\n00:19:01.972 --> 00:19:04.730\nWe should take on that case study.\n\n342\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.120\nLook for the gaps, what could be better.\n\n343\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.110\nPart of the SWOT is gonna\nhelp you with that and\n\n344\n00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:14.645\nanalyzing how you can move from where\nyou are now to the desired state.\n\n345\n00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:15.716\n&gt;&gt; So you can fall into the gap.\n\n346\n00:19:15.716 --> 00:19:16.653\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n347\n00:19:16.653 --> 00:19:18.179\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n348\n00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:21.340\nthen having the maturity model set up.\n\n349\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.160\nThe CMMI maturity model is\npretty straight forward.\n\n350\n00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.060\nThis one here is just that you\ncurrently don't have anything in place.\n\n351\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:35.530\nSo, as you read through your case study,\nyou can find an opportunity to\n\n352\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.490\nevaluate the maturity level of each\nof the processes that are described.\n\n353\n00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.550\nNow, they may not even talk about\na process, so you can't make an assumption\n\n354\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.200\nthat it's there, or it's not there\nas you're reading the case study.\n\n355\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.060\nBut, they do specify certain strengths and\nweaknesses about different processes.\n\n356\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.620\nThey'll say, for instance,\nthat there's an updated service catalog.\n\n357\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.184\nIt's maintained, I should say.\n\n358\n00:19:56.184 --> 00:19:57.632\nA maintained service catalog.\n\n359\n00:19:57.632 --> 00:20:02.960\nSo you got a sense that, well, if its\nmaintained then its not non-existent.\n\n360\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.720\nThey have some sort of process.\n\n361\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.950\nIt might be that its documented even,\nright?\n\n362\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.620\nConcrete evidence of development.\n\n363\n00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.788\nRepeatable means its documented.\n\n364\n00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:16.412\nI think what you'll find as you read\nthrough the analysis of the processes is\n\n365\n00:20:16.412 --> 00:20:19.543\nthat none of the processes\nwithin this case study on\n\n366\n00:20:19.543 --> 00:20:21.411\nthe exam are much beyond two.\n\n367\n00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:25.985\nThey're written down, they're repeatable,\nbut they are not on the way\n\n368\n00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:30.586\nnecessarily to being fully defined and\nstandardized, not really sure.\n\n369\n00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:34.278\nDon't assume that they are,\nbecause it could be an opportunity for\n\n370\n00:20:34.278 --> 00:20:36.236\nimprovement a bit later on, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:41.260\nWhat is ISO?\n\n372\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.200\nIt is the standard for\nIT service management.\n\n373\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.930\nRemember a standard is a certification.\n\n374\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.527\nYou have checked the boxes.\n\n375\n00:20:50.527 --> 00:20:52.880\nBasically it says thou shalt have this.\n\n376\n00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.181\nITIL is not a standard, I should say.\n\n377\n00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:02.906\nITIL doesn't present itself as a standard\nbecause, it's providing guidance,\n\n378\n00:21:02.906 --> 00:21:07.740\nsuggestions, good ideas that have been\nproven to work over and over again.\n\n379\n00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.700\nSo it's become a best practice because\nit's been tried and tested, but\n\n380\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.780\nit's not a standard.\n\n381\n00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.830\nAnd there's a lot of interpretation and\n\n382\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.920\nadaptation you can bring\nto your adoption of ITIL.\n\n383\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.710\nSo, if you have a fairly mature ITIL IT\nservice management organization, you\n\n384\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:33.000\ncan very well get to an ISO certification,\nISO 20000, by adopting ITIL.\n\n385\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.532\nYou can check a lot of\nthe boxes by adopting ITIL.\n\n386\n00:21:36.532 --> 00:21:39.782\nITIL is not a standard but ISO 20000 is.\n\n387\n00:21:39.782 --> 00:21:45.907\nMoving down toward that,\nyou can see some details of this, right?\n\n388\n00:21:45.907 --> 00:21:48.550\nThe details of ISO 20000.\n\n389\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.959\nAnd 25 cents, again.\n\n390\n00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:53.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll get you a bad cup of coffee on\n\n391\n00:21:53.823 --> 00:21:55.232\nthe exam, right?\n\n392\n00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:57.510\nIt's not an ISO 20000 exam.\n\n393\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.120\nKnowing that ISO 20000 is\nthe IT service management\n\n394\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.080\nstandard is a good connection to make.\n\n395\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.898\nKnowing that there's value in approaching\nstandards and trying to get certify.\n\n396\n00:22:09.898 --> 00:22:13.790\nBut this is an ITIL exam,\nnot an ISO 20000 exam.\n\n397\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:20.470\nYou can march toward this ISO 20000\ncertification through the adoption and\n\n398\n00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.200\nadaptation of ITIL.\n\n399\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.570\nAnd that's really what the focus is.\n\n400\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.551\nThe adoption and\nadaptation piece of it, okay.\n\n401\n00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:28.379\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n402\n00:22:28.379 --> 00:22:31.010\n&gt;&gt; Now Six Sigma,\nanother best practice out there.\n\n403\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.288\nSix Sigma sometimes called Lean Sigma,\n\n404\n00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:36.175\nwhich is kind of a subset of Six Sigma,\nif you will.\n\n405\n00:22:36.175 --> 00:22:42.460\nSix Sigma is the public framework for\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n406\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.910\nCSI relies heavily on\nthe concepts discussed\n\n407\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.930\nin a full blown Six Sigma certification,\nfor instance, right?\n\n408\n00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.766\nI myself am a green belt in Six Sigma\nmeaning they have those black belts and\n\n409\n00:22:55.766 --> 00:23:00.130\ngreen belts, it's the way they\nrate out the certifications.\n\n410\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:04.200\nAnd I'll say this from my personal\nexperience, the combination of having\n\n411\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.970\nthe framework of ITIL,\nas an IT Service Management best practice.\n\n412\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.375\nAnd having the discipline of Six Sigma,\n\n413\n00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:14.740\ncontinuous improvement is a very\npowerful connection to make.\n\n414\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.605\nSix Sigma or just CSI if you\njust keep it at that level.\n\n415\n00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:21.674\nA continuous service\nimprovement methodology,\n\n416\n00:23:21.674 --> 00:23:25.105\nwhere it just becomes the way\nyou work can become a very,\n\n417\n00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:29.427\nvery powerful transformative way\nof working for your organization.\n\n418\n00:23:29.427 --> 00:23:33.777\nI highly recommend that you\nexpose yourself to the nuances of\n\n419\n00:23:33.777 --> 00:23:38.736\nSix Sigma as a way to bolster your\nawareness of the principles of CSI.\n\n420\n00:23:38.736 --> 00:23:40.710\n&gt;&gt; So CSI and Six Sigma are very similar?\n\n421\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.631\n&gt;&gt; Very similar, CSI I would\nsay is a superficial treatment.\n\n422\n00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:46.921\nSix Sigma is a deep dive treatment.\n\n423\n00:23:46.921 --> 00:23:47.977\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n424\n00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:50.740\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\nSix Sigma was born out of industry.\n\n425\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:57.316\nWe're talking about,\nDefault per million opportunities.\n\n426\n00:23:57.316 --> 00:23:58.314\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; That kind of thing.\n\n427\n00:23:58.314 --> 00:24:01.942\nSo if you're machining parts and\nthe tolerance for\n\n428\n00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:04.903\nthe width needs to be within the microns.\n\n429\n00:24:04.903 --> 00:24:08.643\nSix Sigma can go in and start measuring\nthrough quality control just how good your\n\n430\n00:24:08.643 --> 00:24:11.620\nparts are coming down the assembly line,\nso to speak.\n\n431\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.280\nSo Six Sigma perhaps was born\nin the manufacturing sector and\n\n432\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.870\ncertainly hond there when you're talking\nabout the inth level of quality control.\n\n433\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:20.672\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Motorola.\n\n434\n00:24:20.672 --> 00:24:21.625\n&gt;&gt; Motorola and Nasa.\n\n435\n00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:23.236\nThose types of things.\n\n436\n00:24:23.236 --> 00:24:23.825\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n437\n00:24:23.825 --> 00:24:24.958\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n438\n00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.576\nSo Six Sigma is a discipline.\n\n439\n00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:29.759\nObviously goes much much\ndeeper than you need to go for\n\n440\n00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:32.880\na holistic view of managing\ncross the life cycle.\n\n441\n00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.370\nSo I'm not saying the Six Sigma\nis gonna help you master\n\n442\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.710\nthe inth degree of detail within\nan IT service management.\n\n443\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.827\nBut the principles of Six Sigma,\non which CSI is based are universal and\n\n444\n00:24:43.827 --> 00:24:46.029\napplied to all kinds of walks of life.\n\n445\n00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:48.550\n&gt;&gt; Do they?\n&gt;&gt; Not just manufacturing, not just good.\n\n446\n00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.170\nAnd again you get some\ntool sets there too.\n\n447\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.866\nAs you explore Six Sigma you'll get\nsome good little tools ideas, a little,\n\n448\n00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:57.825\nhow do you analyze situations?\n\n449\n00:24:57.825 --> 00:25:03.686\nAnd how do you chase data effectively and\nhow do you get rid of the noise?\n\n450\n00:25:03.686 --> 00:25:06.197\nSo they give you some good\nideas on that sort of things.\n\n451\n00:25:06.197 --> 00:25:10.240\nSo highly recommend that if you want\na little deeper dive on the continual\n\n452\n00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.545\nservice improvement side, go toward\nlean sigma or six sigma is a great idea,\n\n453\n00:25:14.545 --> 00:25:15.160\nalright?\n\n454\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.920\nGood information, right?\n\n455\n00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.930\nAnd then of course we've talked\nabout governance earlier.\n\n456\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.294\nAnother best practice\nout there that can help\n\n457\n00:25:24.294 --> 00:25:28.465\nyou understand your governance\nmodel is called COBIT.\n\n458\n00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:35.450\nCOBIT, Control Objectives for Information\nand related Technologies, right COBIT.\n\n459\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.230\nAgain, it's a best practice for control.\n\n460\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.350\nNow ITIL does help you with control.\n\n461\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:46.640\nI mean by defining 26 processes and\nsaying follow these processes,\n\n462\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.250\nyou're introducing governance,\nall right in a way.\n\n463\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.500\nNot just in a way in a very specific way,\nright?\n\n464\n00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.260\nSo governance is important.\n\n465\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.080\nThere's a whole discipline out\nthere called COBIT that just talks\n\n466\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.370\nabout what kinda controls\nyou should have in place.\n\n467\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.360\nAnd where they need to be,\n\n468\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.140\nand when is the policy effective\nversus a directive, versus a process?\n\n469\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.320\nMeasurement, transparency,\n\n470\n00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.850\nreporting, all that's also related\nto COBIT, or controls as well.\n\n471\n00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.970\nSo a good little synergy between ITIL and\nCOBIT could also be built\n\n472\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.080\nbecause adopting ITIL can satisfy\nmany of the objectives of COBIT.\n\n473\n00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.390\nA good colleague of mine, a really\ngood friend of mine in this sphere,\n\n474\n00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.140\nI wanna quote her on this one.\n\n475\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.880\nCOBIT is a destination,\na way to get there is through ITIL, right?\n\n476\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.190\nSo COBIT, you wanna get things under\ncontrol ,that's a worthy destination.\n\n477\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.940\nHow do you get there?\n\n478\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.910\nThis framework of ITIL gives\nyou a very good road map,\n\n479\n00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:50.460\na very good way to get toward the control\nof your service management methodologies.\n\n480\n00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.960\nGreat, okay.\n\n481\n00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:59.107\nWe all saw earlier this Capability\nof Maturity Model Integration, CMMI.\n\n482\n00:26:59.107 --> 00:27:03.910\nThat's what it stands for,\nCapability Maturity Model Integration.\n\n483\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.420\nIt's a way that you can come\nup with a numerical rating for\n\n484\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.380\nhow mature you are in a given process.\n\n485\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.740\nSo CMMI gives you a baseline or\na basis for\n\n486\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.730\nanalyzing just how mature you\nare which is pretty effective, right?\n\n487\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.796\nSo if you're looking at ITIL as a process\nmodel, if you look at it simply as\n\n488\n00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:30.724\na process model, than CMMI can become\na very important factor for you.\n\n489\n00:27:30.724 --> 00:27:34.120\nI mean, how mature is your\navailability management process?\n\n490\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.730\nHow mature is your incident\nmanagement process?\n\n491\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.350\nIt's a great question to ask.\n\n492\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.390\nWell, this particular model,\nthis capability maturity model\n\n493\n00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.270\ngives you a very effective,\nand repeatable approach for\n\n494\n00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:51.015\naccessing the maturity of your processes,\nvery methodical approach.\n\n495\n00:27:51.015 --> 00:27:54.372\nThat could be very powerful,\nwhere do you begin, right.\n\n496\n00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.290\nAre you already strong at something?\n\n497\n00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.932\nAre you weak at something else?\n\n498\n00:27:57.932 --> 00:28:00.750\nSo kinda gives you an idea\nwhat you might wanna land.\n\n499\n00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.780\nA word of caution here though.\n\n500\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.620\nWhile a maturity model, and if you do\nsome assessments of your maturity and\n\n501\n00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:14.380\nyou come up with these nice CMMI CMMI\nrankings, are you ranked at number two,\n\n502\n00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.730\nnot very mature, are you ranked at\nnumber four which is pretty darn mature.\n\n503\n00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.952\nThose rankings are important they give\nyou somewhat the lay of the land.\n\n504\n00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:29.160\nBut what caution you get just because you\nmight be week at one process and somewhat\n\n505\n00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.460\nstronger at the other one it doesn't mean\nthat you should start with the weakest.\n\n506\n00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.850\nIt might be that the most\ncritical process you have,\n\n507\n00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.620\nis the one you have to bolster first,\nall right.\n\n508\n00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.830\nSo depending on where you are in the biz,\nhow flexible you need to be?\n\n509\n00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.575\nOr what pain you're it currently\nexperiencing due to your maturity levels,\n\n510\n00:28:49.575 --> 00:28:53.930\nthat's going to be also an indicator\nof where you should begin?\n\n511\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.390\nAnd how you should approach\nbringing up the level of maturity?\n\n512\n00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.620\nIt's not just because one is\nweak that you go focus on it.\n\n513\n00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.572\nIt's because maybe another one is\ncritical and you go focus on that, okay,\n\n514\n00:29:05.572 --> 00:29:06.389\nas an example.\n\n515\n00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:07.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n516\n00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n517\n00:29:10.687 --> 00:29:13.760\nSo what does it allow you to do?\n\n518\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.210\nIt allows you to link your management\nengineering activities to the business\n\n519\n00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.990\nobjectives ultimately.\n\n520\n00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.240\nIf you look at the maturity\nmodel of any process,\n\n521\n00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.910\nyou could also be looking at the maturity\nmodel of your business processes.\n\n522\n00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.925\nAnd if your business processes\nare weak you can attack them as well.\n\n523\n00:29:30.925 --> 00:29:35.913\nSo CMMI is not just a maturity model for\nIT service management processes,\n\n524\n00:29:35.913 --> 00:29:41.480\nthey are there to shore up if you will\nthe maturity of any business process.\n\n525\n00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.454\nLinking business maturity to IT service\nmanagement maturity would be a nice\n\n526\n00:29:46.454 --> 00:29:49.264\nlittle trick putting those two together.\n\n527\n00:29:49.264 --> 00:29:53.550\nl gave you a very clear IT\nexample of that link up.\n\n528\n00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.440\nWe were embarking on the implementation\n\n529\n00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.925\nof IT service continuity\nmanagement years ago.\n\n530\n00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:05.071\nAnd what we found was that and we knew\ncuz we read from our good old ITIL books\n\n531\n00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:09.968\nthat IT service continuity should be\nbased on true business impact and\n\n532\n00:30:09.968 --> 00:30:12.140\nevaluation of the risk there.\n\n533\n00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:19.000\nAnd that it should be following what the\nbusiness continuity management scope is.\n\n534\n00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.840\nSo it's business driven.\n\n535\n00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.510\nSo as we started filling out our IT\nservice continuity management regime and\n\n536\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.680\nstarted asking these questions we turned\nto the business and begin to ask them and\n\n537\n00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.930\nsaid we don't know.\n\n538\n00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.760\nWe don't know what we would do if\na tornado struck that manufacturing plant.\n\n539\n00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.690\nWe're not sure what we would do if we had\na pandemic that took away our support\n\n540\n00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.860\nof the manufacturing plant in Poland or\nin Asia or wherever it might be.\n\n541\n00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.830\nWe're not sure how we would deal with\na transportation strike in India, so\n\n542\n00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.555\npeople can't come to work, right.\n\n543\n00:30:49.555 --> 00:30:53.420\nWe not sure what we'd do from\na business continuity perspective.\n\n544\n00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:58.308\nSo our interest in IT service\ncontinuity drove a discussion\n\n545\n00:30:58.308 --> 00:31:00.565\nwith their organization.\n\n546\n00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:04.405\nWith the business organization, I say,\nnot their, with the business organization\n\n547\n00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:07.470\nrelated to their business\ncontinuity management needs.\n\n548\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.160\nSo it's kind a like the tail wag the dog\na little bit there but what ended up\n\n549\n00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.760\nhappening is we turned that back around so\nthat we understood the business better.\n\n550\n00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.590\nThe business understood their needs\nbetter as related to continuity.\n\n551\n00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.170\nAnd then IT could be better\nat providing the continuity\n\n552\n00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.230\nas relates to the business impact.\n\n553\n00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:29.221\nSo this is example how you can use\nthe CMMI models to build synergies\n\n554\n00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:32.532\nbetween the business and IT organization.\n\n555\n00:31:32.532 --> 00:31:33.551\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example.\n\n556\n00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:34.051\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n557\n00:31:35.745 --> 00:31:36.778\nI mean assessments.\n\n558\n00:31:36.778 --> 00:31:40.475\nGo through a CMMI assessment get\nenough people in the room and\n\n559\n00:31:40.475 --> 00:31:45.495\nyou can see that it's not standardized\nthey're following this kind of process.\n\n560\n00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:50.010\nSo we're here, it's not written down but\nthis group of people wrote down theirs and\n\n561\n00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.011\nthey kinda repeat it and\nthe one in the middle has a very.\n\n562\n00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.814\nRobust process, but\nno one follows it, right?\n\n563\n00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:59.500\nYou can do this kind of assessment,\nagain, get enough people in a room you\n\n564\n00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.840\ncan can start getting some anecdotal\ninformation about your maturity model.\n\n565\n00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.270\nSure, you can do that, but what CMII\npromises is a more thorough assessment\n\n566\n00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.900\nwhere you deep dive into\nvery specific questions.\n\n567\n00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.620\nAnd with very specific ratings,\nyou rate out the maturity.\n\n568\n00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.730\nAnd then based on that,\nyou could start building commitment for\n\n569\n00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.250\nimprovement and ongoing compliance.\n\n570\n00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.310\nOkay, so when to assess?\n\n571\n00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.550\nInteresting kinds of concepts here,\nwhen do you assess?\n\n572\n00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.640\nDuring project initiation?\n\n573\n00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.670\nYou're certainly assessing time,\nmoney, resources, right?\n\n574\n00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.470\nOnce processes are in place,\ndo you assess then?\n\n575\n00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:47.290\nSure, that's the plan, do, and checking\npart, you've got plan, do, check, act.\n\n576\n00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.610\nSo, certainly you assess\nduring the planning stage,\n\n577\n00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.302\nthat's kind of getting the baseline.\n\n578\n00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:55.000\nAnd then once the processes are in place,\nyou're gonna come back and check again.\n\n579\n00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.530\nHow are we doing now, are we better?\n\n580\n00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.180\nAre we complying, are we moving\nthe needle in the right direction?\n\n581\n00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.470\nAnd then of course as the project\nis continuing to move forward,\n\n582\n00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.360\nyou have your milestone checks.\n\n583\n00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.824\nAre we moving in the right\ndirection in that regard?\n\n584\n00:33:09.824 --> 00:33:11.948\nWhat to assess?\n\n585\n00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:16.472\nWe've seen this in some previous courses,\nthe process only, or\n\n586\n00:33:16.472 --> 00:33:21.295\nyou also consider the people,\nprocesses and the technology?\n\n587\n00:33:21.295 --> 00:33:24.425\nOr do you do a deep dive full\nassessment of everything?\n\n588\n00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:28.990\nHow it interacts with the business,\nwhat is the extreme value?\n\n589\n00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:36.550\nWhat do I mean by extreme value, ultimate\nvalue, what is the actual value, etc.?\n\n590\n00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.480\nSo, when you consider full assessment,\n\n591\n00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.660\nyou're also getting into\nthe attitudinal part.\n\n592\n00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.530\nHow does the organization feel about this?\n\n593\n00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:48.952\nDo they comply, do they like it,\nis it working, etc?\n\n594\n00:33:48.952 --> 00:33:52.177\nSo you can do a process only of your\nassessments, people, process and\n\n595\n00:33:52.177 --> 00:33:53.190\ntechnology.\n\n596\n00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.273\nOr go even deeper and get into attitudes,\norganizational structures, etc.\n\n597\n00:33:58.273 --> 00:34:00.711\nGovernance, policy, etc.\n\n598\n00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:06.856\nSo the pros and cons of assessments,\nwhether you do them externally or\n\n599\n00:34:06.856 --> 00:34:09.103\ninternally, we've seen\nthis play out before.\n\n600\n00:34:09.103 --> 00:34:10.980\nI'm not gonna rehash every one of these.\n\n601\n00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.790\nIn a nutshell,\nwhat you get out of external assessments,\n\n602\n00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.840\nis you get a fresh look.\n\n603\n00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.560\nYou're not blindsided by\nyour own prejudices, and\n\n604\n00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.420\nyou get the non-political\nlook from an assessment.\n\n605\n00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.895\nThe downside of external ones is they\ncould be expensive and they come in,\n\n606\n00:34:26.895 --> 00:34:28.079\nassess, and walk away.\n\n607\n00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:32.710\nThey're not necessarily invested in\nthe outcomes or the ultimate success.\n\n608\n00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:38.820\nInternal assessments, they maybe suffer\nfrom the blind spots, the politics, right?\n\n609\n00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.030\nThey may also suffer from\nthe lack of expertise, but\n\n610\n00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.490\nthey probably won't suffer from\na commitment to an end goal.\n\n611\n00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:49.800\nThey probably won't suffer for\nthe follow through to make sure that\n\n612\n00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.960\nwe actually get to where we need to be,\nright?\n\n613\n00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.870\nSo, some of the pros and cons there.\n\n614\n00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.990\nExternal assessments,\n\n615\n00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:00.970\ninternal assessments,\nITIL is not prescribing which way to go.\n\n616\n00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:06.040\nIf you have examples of\ndeep political strife,\n\n617\n00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.050\nand you lack the expertise,\nthen an external one can really help.\n\n618\n00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.960\nThey'll kind of calm\nthe waters politically,\n\n619\n00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.788\nbecause they're apolitical,\nthey're outside the organization.\n\n620\n00:35:14.788 --> 00:35:17.480\nAnd they're bringing\nnecessary knowledge to it, so\n\n621\n00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.810\nit's more a sterile approach to it.\n\n622\n00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.940\nJust be cautious of their\ncommitment to the ongoing success,\n\n623\n00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.550\nbecause they're eventually gonna make\nthese recommendations and then walk away.\n\n624\n00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.160\nSo I say be cautious,\nnot that they don't care about you,\n\n625\n00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.460\nit's just they're not gonna be\nthere when the fires start raging.\n\n626\n00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.213\nSo, again, advantages of assessments\nare that you assess the advantages,\n\n627\n00:35:42.213 --> 00:35:46.003\nassessment advantages that give\nyou objective perspectives.\n\n628\n00:35:46.003 --> 00:35:51.479\nObjective, not opinions, not rumors,\nnot whining, as we've talked about before.\n\n629\n00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.284\nOf course, the risk is that\nit's only assessment right now,\n\n630\n00:35:56.284 --> 00:35:57.874\nit's a snapshot in time.\n\n631\n00:35:57.874 --> 00:36:02.975\nSo you should consider the assessment\nas more of an engine, than an event.\n\n632\n00:36:02.975 --> 00:36:05.900\nIt's something you do ongoing, always.\n\n633\n00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:11.088\nAnd that's just part and partial to\nthe continual service improvement cycle,\n\n634\n00:36:11.088 --> 00:36:13.445\nthe plan, do, check, act cycle.\n\n635\n00:36:13.445 --> 00:36:18.960\nIt's a cycle, so you keep assessing,\nrinse and repeat, come back again.\n\n636\n00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the rinse and repeat thing.\n\n637\n00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n638\n00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:21.870\n[LAUGHTER] Rinse and repeat.\n\n639\n00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:22.370\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n640\n00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.260\nNow, value of process\nversus maturity of process,\n\n641\n00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.660\nthis is what I was talking\nabout earlier to some extent.\n\n642\n00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.450\nThe criticality of your processes,\n\n643\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.490\nit might be that the biggest pain\nyou're feeling is in change management.\n\n644\n00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.666\nIt seems that it's just\na cowboy organization,\n\n645\n00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.531\npeople are changing things all the time.\n\n646\n00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:46.593\nAnd we have so many things broken that we\nfeel really compelled to go fix things but\n\n647\n00:36:46.593 --> 00:36:48.266\nbecause it's so out of control,\n\n648\n00:36:48.266 --> 00:36:51.330\nwe end up breaking more things\nthan we're actually fixing.\n\n649\n00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.540\nSo it could be that that's\nthe reality of your organization\n\n650\n00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.350\nis that change management is\ncausing you the most pain.\n\n651\n00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.727\nIf it's causing you the most pain,\nthen it's critical.\n\n652\n00:37:01.727 --> 00:37:06.125\nIt's a bit more critical than, perhaps\nincidence management, which is maybe,\n\n653\n00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:10.280\nless mature but not causing you\nas much pain, as an example.\n\n654\n00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.400\nThis is intended to be an example,\nnot a prescription.\n\n655\n00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.330\nIn other words, ITIL is not saying\nthat capacity management and\n\n656\n00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.910\navailability management\nare the most critical for you.\n\n657\n00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.160\nIt's just an example.\n\n658\n00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.321\nIf they are critical, you see on\nthe criticality scale over here,\n\n659\n00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:28.118\nthe value you get from them.\n\n660\n00:37:28.118 --> 00:37:30.465\nAnd they're also low\non the maturity scale,\n\n661\n00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:35.350\nthen they're a nice little sweet spot\nhere, you need to be focusing on those.\n\n662\n00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.040\nSo this is just a way to kind of document,\n\n663\n00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.450\nif you will,\nwhich processes you might go for.\n\n664\n00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.380\nSo you do your maturity assessment,\nthat's one level.\n\n665\n00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.360\nThen you do a criticality assessment,\n\n666\n00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.960\nbasically, well which ones are causing\nus most pain or most often?\n\n667\n00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.719\nIt's not necessary that the least mature\nprocess is causing the most pain,\n\n668\n00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:57.493\nthere's not necessarily\na direct correlation there.\n\n669\n00:37:57.493 --> 00:38:00.510\nThat's what this is trying to point to,\nso, coming up with a methodical way.\n\n670\n00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:06.540\nSo obviously, if you had a highly\nmature process that's a very low value,\n\n671\n00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.570\nyou don't need to be spending\ntime on that process.\n\n672\n00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.820\nNot only is it mature already,\nit's also not adding a lot of value.\n\n673\n00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.177\nNow this is me speaking,\nthis is not ITIL speaking, so\n\n674\n00:38:17.177 --> 00:38:20.140\nthis is not gonna help you in the exam,\nI promise.\n\n675\n00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.430\nBut it could help you back operationally.\n\n676\n00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:26.845\nThere are lots of studies, lots of book\nwritten about IT service management.\n\n677\n00:38:26.845 --> 00:38:32.120\nITIL is certainly respected in this fear,\nand rightly so.\n\n678\n00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:35.120\nSo where would you begin?\n\n679\n00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:40.130\nIf you had a blank slate right now and\nhad no ITIL knowledge,\n\n680\n00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:44.180\nand had no IT service management\nmaturity in your organization.\n\n681\n00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.150\nImagine that, I mean you've got some,\n\n682\n00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:47.120\njust imagine you're starting\nwith a green field.\n\n683\n00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.790\nWhere would you begin?\n\n684\n00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:55.205\nIt's common that, sometimes called the\niron core, the iron triangle, if you will.\n\n685\n00:38:55.205 --> 00:38:59.205\nIncident management, problem management,\nand change management.\n\n686\n00:39:00.315 --> 00:39:04.865\nIncident, problem, and change kind of form\nthe iron core of where you should begin.\n\n687\n00:39:06.185 --> 00:39:12.365\nBecause incident allows you to respond\nquickly and customers want responses.\n\n688\n00:39:12.365 --> 00:39:15.305\nProblem management lets\nyou do a deep dive,\n\n689\n00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:19.364\ndeliberative approach to why\ndo their fires keep coming up?\n\n690\n00:39:19.364 --> 00:39:21.702\nAnd change management\nallows you to get control,\n\n691\n00:39:21.702 --> 00:39:24.776\nmaybe even change management might\nhave been causing the fires.\n\n692\n00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:27.889\nSo you can put out some fires just by\ngetting change management under control.\n\n693\n00:39:27.889 --> 00:39:32.073\nAnd an effective change management\nregime will also let you safely\n\n694\n00:39:32.073 --> 00:39:36.865\nmake the changes that problem management\nhas discerned are the right ones.\n\n695\n00:39:36.865 --> 00:39:40.563\nSo incident management,\nlet's face the customers effectively and\n\n696\n00:39:40.563 --> 00:39:42.804\nrestore service as quickly as possible.\n\n697\n00:39:42.804 --> 00:39:47.804\nProblem management, deep dive, rooting\nout the underlying causes of incidents.\n\n698\n00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:50.507\nAnd then change management\nin a controlled, safe way,\n\n699\n00:39:50.507 --> 00:39:54.460\nmaking the changes necessary so\nthese incidents don't come back up.\n\n700\n00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.960\nNow another advantage of the iron core\nis that problem management in particular\n\n701\n00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.660\ncan do that deep dive and\nfind the other weaknesses.\n\n702\n00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.620\nMaybe you're always weak at\ndesigning availability or\n\n703\n00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.510\nmaybe you're always weak at testing,\nright?\n\n704\n00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:12.303\nProblem management can discern where those\nweaknesses are because it's deliverative.\n\n705\n00:40:12.303 --> 00:40:16.337\nAgain, that's Terry Decker speaking,\nalong with a lot of other people and\n\n706\n00:40:16.337 --> 00:40:18.871\na lot of from my own experience as well.\n\n707\n00:40:18.871 --> 00:40:22.490\nThat's not an ITIL exam process\nITSM approach by the book but\n\n708\n00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.920\nyou can find some criticality\namong those three processes.\n\n709\n00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.480\nGet good at those and\n\n710\n00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.850\nyou will begin to sniff out where all\nthe other improvements need to come.\n\n711\n00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Good wisdom.\n\n712\n00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.952\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so a benchmark is comparing\nyourself to something else.\n\n713\n00:40:37.952 --> 00:40:39.480\nThat's what a benchmark is.\n\n714\n00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.220\nPerhaps you can compare yourself to\nanother organization of a similar size and\n\n715\n00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.760\nscope and see how they're doing and\nwhere their strengths and weaknesses are.\n\n716\n00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.160\nPerhaps it's a benchmark to a standard.\n\n717\n00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.730\nYou compare yourself to\nISO 20,000 which says\n\n718\n00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.723\nyou should have these things in place,\nso you can.\n\n719\n00:40:56.723 --> 00:41:00.340\nBenchmark is a comparison to\nsomething outside of you.\n\n720\n00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.700\nYou can even compare yourself to\n\n721\n00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.965\nmaturity model across these\n26 processes that ITIL has.\n\n722\n00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:11.175\nYou can compare yourself to those 26\nprocesses, and based on a maturity level.\n\n723\n00:41:11.175 --> 00:41:13.875\nThat's also a level of benchmarking.\n\n724\n00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:17.245\nThe advantage of benchmarking,\nas with other types of assessments,\n\n725\n00:41:17.245 --> 00:41:21.380\nis it gives you a way to evaluate or\n\n726\n00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:25.980\nassess where you are, right,\nin comparison to something else.\n\n727\n00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.570\nAnd of course based on that comparison,\nyou could then make recommendations for\n\n728\n00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.940\nwhere to move forward and\nhow to move forward.\n\n729\n00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.920\n&gt;&gt; Great, all right.\n\n730\n00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.370\n&gt;&gt; The CSI register, another important\naspect is that when you come up with\n\n731\n00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:45.300\nimprovement ideas log them,\nkeep them visible, keep them moving.\n\n732\n00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.874\nCrack the whip, beat the drum,\nmake sure that you are aware of what\n\n733\n00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:54.295\nimprovements are in play,\nwhich one's might be in play later.\n\n734\n00:41:54.295 --> 00:42:00.690\nAnd use that as a mechanism for on going\ntransparency and progress, all right?\n\n735\n00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.363\nAnd then full circle back\nhere to the CSI approach,\n\n736\n00:42:03.363 --> 00:42:06.795\nreinforcing this is also the seven step,\nimprovement process.\n\n737\n00:42:06.795 --> 00:42:07.659\n&gt;&gt; The cycle again.\n\n738\n00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:09.010\n&gt;&gt; There's that cycle again.\n\n739\n00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:12.420\nAnd right there in the middle,\nplan, do, check, act, right?\n\n740\n00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.020\nSo making sure those\nthings are well in play.\n\n741\n00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.440\nAnd taking this methodical approach\nwhere you understand the vision\n\n742\n00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.310\nbefore you move forward with planning.\n\n743\n00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.130\nThat you understand\nthe overall objectives and\n\n744\n00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.470\nthe value you're supposed\nto be delivering.\n\n745\n00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.820\nAnd then doing some sort of baseline\nassessment of where you are right now,\n\n746\n00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.270\nas we talked about before.\n\n747\n00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:36.020\nOnce you know where you are, you can\nthen assess, well, where should we be?\n\n748\n00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.610\nThat's where that gap analysis begins and\n\n749\n00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:42.570\nbased on that analysis you can\nstart planning for improvement.\n\n750\n00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.330\nYou can implement the improvement and\nfind out did you get there.\n\n751\n00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.920\nDid you move the deal\non the right direction?\n\n752\n00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.580\nRinse and repeat\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n753\n00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.150\n&gt;&gt; There's a cycle.\n\n754\n00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.050\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n755\n00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:57.250\n&gt;&gt; And exam takers, take a methodical\napproach to the given question, right.\n\n756\n00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.980\nAnd don't jump to the solution,\n\n757\n00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.740\neven though it might be the right\nsolution in your own mind,\n\n758\n00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.330\nyou've got to take a methodical approach\nto assess that before you get there.\n\n759\n00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.200\nThat's the approach to improving.\n\n760\n00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.286\nThat's the general approach to\nunderstanding how you can know\n\n761\n00:43:12.286 --> 00:43:14.609\nan improvement is even necessary.\n\n762\n00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:15.663\nAnd that's that.\n\n763\n00:43:15.663 --> 00:43:17.420\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Terry.\n\n764\n00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.307\nAnything else to wrap up or we're there?\n\n765\n00:43:19.307 --> 00:43:20.910\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; That's it, okay.\n\n766\n00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.190\nITL melk implementing and improving ITSM.\n\n767\n00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.590\nThere is so\nmuch content in the ITL melk library.\n\n768\n00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.300\nLots of videos to look at.\n\n769\n00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.520\nLook at them all, you'll be glad you did.\n\n770\n00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.257\nAnd thank for for watching ITProTV.\n\n771\n00:43:33.257 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.480\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.960\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.225\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, we are now\nin the very final stages of ITIL MALC,\n\n6\n00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.990\nbecause it's the sample paper review.\n\n7\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.510\nThat's right.\n\n8\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.520\nIf you've been with us all along,\nyou know we've been leading up to this.\n\n9\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.750\nIt's the sample paper review,\nhelping you prepare for that exam.\n\n10\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.570\nWho's gonna do that?\n\n11\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.580\nWhy, it's Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.620\nSherlock Terry, right there.\n\n13\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.485\n&gt;&gt; Thank you much, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:40.420\nDr. Watson, we are elementary here.\n\n15\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.150\nWe really are.\n\n16\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.010\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n17\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.480\nwhat we're doing here in this particular\nepisode is we're gonna be focusing on\n\n18\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390\nthe sample paper as we've done with\nthe other intermediate level courses.\n\n19\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.350\nNow, this is not your first sample paper.\n\n20\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.460\nThis is not your first intermediate exam.\n\n21\n00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.040\nRight, but it is challenging.\n\n22\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.130\nThere's a few more\nthings to consider here.\n\n23\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.380\nAmong the many things you can download,\nthe sample papers are the most valuable.\n\n24\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.535\nWalking through the paces of trying\nto pass the the sample paper exams or\n\n25\n00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:08.305\npractice exams if you will.\n\n26\n00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:12.415\nPracticing these is critical\nto your success, absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:14.395\nIt's a good indication.\n\n28\n00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.675\nIf you could do well on these exams,\n\n29\n00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:19.882\nit's a good indication you'll\ndo well on the real exam.\n\n30\n00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:23.432\nI wouldn't say it's a great indication,\nbut it's a good indication.\n\n31\n00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:27.482\nThe reason I say that is I want you to\nremain humble, right, be confident but\n\n32\n00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:30.322\nnot cocky, if you get really\ngood at these sample papers,\n\n33\n00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:34.612\nyou got them under your belt, again you're\ngonna have to take the same methodology as\n\n34\n00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:37.532\nyou go to the real exam for that success.\n\n35\n00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:42.790\nAnd don't make the shortcuts, be\nmethodical, be diligent as you go through.\n\n36\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.360\nThis MALC exam has some challenges.\n\n37\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.950\nLet's look at the graphic here.\n\n38\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.850\nWhat I've done here is I've highlighted in\nred how it distinguishes themselves for\n\n39\n00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.670\nthe intermediate levels\nthat you've already taken.\n\n40\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.570\nAgain, you're no rookie to these exams.\n\n41\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.930\nBut what's really different about\nthis MALC exam is that well,\n\n42\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.940\nthere's ten questions instead of eight.\n\n43\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.610\nRight.\n\n44\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.370\nYou get 120 minutes,\ninstead of 90 minutes.\n\n45\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.560\nYou get a bit more time.\n\n46\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.100\nWhich may seem like,\nwell that's just fine.\n\n47\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.000\nThey give me 30 more minutes for\njust two more questions?\n\n48\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.358\nBut there's a big, big, big thing there.\n\n49\n00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:17.250\nIs that there's a case study\nthat accompanies this exam,\n\n50\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.280\nthat's six pages long.\n\n51\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.860\nAnd the questions and\nthe scenarios are a page long, right?\n\n52\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.330\nWhat I mean by that is that\nthe scenario itself is a page long.\n\n53\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.000\nAnd then you get to the questions and\nthe answers and\n\n54\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.580\nthey may flow across more than one page.\n\n55\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.790\nThere's a lot more reading involved.\n\n56\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.810\nSo, while you may have gotten a sense for\npace on the intermediate level exams,\n\n57\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470\nI want you to really be concerned\nabout pace on this MALC exam.\n\n58\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.840\nIt's a bit more challenging within\nthe time limit of 120 minutes\n\n59\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.720\nbecause there's so much to read.\n\n60\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.370\nNow, there's good news here.\n\n61\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.140\nThe case study that's six pages long\nis the same case study that you\n\n62\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.590\nhave available for you to download, right?\n\n63\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.600\nThat case study is the identical case\nstudy that you will find n the real exam.\n\n64\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.550\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n65\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, I highly recommend that\nyou get expert at this case study.\n\n66\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.170\nYou know it inside out, right?\n\n67\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.430\nSo, don't let that be\nwhere you have to turn for\n\n68\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.800\na particular detail,\nwhen you get to the real exam.\n\n69\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.980\nJust pretty much have those\ndetails in your head, or\n\n70\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.220\na good lay of the land of where they are,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.915\nSo you'll get the case study,\nyou'll get to use it and\n\n72\n00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:23.974\nreference it as you're taking the exam.\n\n73\n00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.588\nYou certainly will be able to do that, but\n\n74\n00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:31.070\nany given question may require you to,\ngo to page two of the case study or\n\n75\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.290\npage seven of the case study or\npage six of the case study.\n\n76\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.540\nMoving around the case study is\nnot time you wanna be wasting.\n\n77\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.490\nYou want to pretty much have\nthis well-organized in your mind\n\n78\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.650\nbefore you get and set that exam.\n\n79\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.440\nThe other things are the same.\n\n80\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.430\nThere's a 5 point answer, there's a 3\npoint answer, there's a 1 point answer and\n\n81\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.360\na 0 point answer.\n\n82\n00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.320\nThere's a another key difference though,\nand not listed here,\n\n83\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.040\nbut another key difference.\n\n84\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.300\nOn the intermediate level exams, they\nstarted shading toward gray a little bit,\n\n85\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.780\ndepending on which exam you're taking.\n\n86\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.500\nWhat I mean by shading toward\ngray is that there would be\n\n87\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.240\nan answer that wasn't explicitly wrong.\n\n88\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.290\nIt just wasn't relevant\nto the specific scenario.\n\n89\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.367\nWell, that grayness plays\nout a lot on the MALC exam.\n\n90\n00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:18.196\nIn other words,\nthe difference between a five answer and\n\n91\n00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:22.982\na three answer might be that the five\nanswer has five positive things and\n\n92\n00:04:22.982 --> 00:04:28.167\ntwo neutral things to say, and the three\npoint answer has three positives and\n\n93\n00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.710\nfive neutrals, so\nyou're gonna be shades of gray.\n\n94\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.310\nThat neutral part what I mean is\nthat it's not necessarily wrong.\n\n95\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.420\nBut it's not specific to this scenario,\n\n96\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.080\nit's not solving an issue as\nit plays out in this scenario.\n\n97\n00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.100\nAnd remember,\nthe scenario is not just a single page,\n\n98\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.780\nthe scenario actually is\nthis six page case study.\n\n99\n00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.730\nKnow that business well in the case study.\n\n100\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.530\n&gt;&gt; Which is available, they can download\nit and then they can read it now.\n\n101\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit's certainly available for you.\n\n102\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n103\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.290\n&gt;&gt; So as we've done, I highly recommend\nthat you be deliberate in your approach.\n\n104\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.970\nTake a methodical approach to your test.\n\n105\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.070\nThere is a great download available for\nyou.\n\n106\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.540\nIt's called,\nGeneral Approach to Exam Taking.\n\n107\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.920\nI highly recommend that you watch\nthat video, it's downloadable.\n\n108\n00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.950\nWatch it, you'll get some good tips and\ntricks on the approach to taking the exam,\n\n109\n00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.490\na very methodical approach.\n\n110\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.630\nAnd use that approach as you take\nsample paper one and sample paper two.\n\n111\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.820\nAnd of course use that approach when\nyou take the real exam as well.\n\n112\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.500\nI say review, I say memorize even, review\nthe case study, know it inside out, right.\n\n113\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.530\nEven before you take sample paper one,\n\n114\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.110\nI would recommend that you review\nthe case study and do a SWOT analysis.\n\n115\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.010\nIn the previous episode we talk\nabout strengths, weaknesses,\n\n116\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.320\nopportunities and threats.\n\n117\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.280\nDo a SWOT analysis of this\nbusiness in the case study.\n\n118\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.710\nAnd it's particularly\nof the IT organization.\n\n119\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.530\nWhat's their strengths?\n\n120\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.512\nWhat's their weaknesses?\n\n121\n00:05:56.512 --> 00:05:59.880\nThat's gonna be very important because\nlater on when you're taking the exam or\n\n122\n00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.080\ntrying to answer a question,\nyou'll see the opportunities for\n\n123\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.570\nimprovement, right,\non those weaknesses side, right.\n\n124\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.640\nIf they're already strong at something,\nthen,\n\n125\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.660\nthat's not something you need to chase.\n\n126\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.320\nSo, that's a good important area.\n\n127\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.170\nAnd, I'd also do a maturity assessment.\n\n128\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.720\nTake your time and, where they explicitly\ntalk about a given process, and\n\n129\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.910\nyou can tell by the way\nthey talk about it.\n\n130\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.100\nGive it a rating, right?\n\n131\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.980\nDon't assume that they have, well,\nI'll give you an example on that one.\n\n132\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.550\nFor instance, there is a statement\nwithin a case study that says\n\n133\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.440\nthe service catalog is well maintained.\n\n134\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.860\nNow, don't extrapolate from that,\nthat it's a fully blown mature process.\n\n135\n00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.780\nIt's well-maintained.\n\n136\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.790\nIt could be a well-maintained, but still\nineffective, we're not really sure, right.\n\n137\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.090\nWell-maintained doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's great.\n\n138\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.190\nAnd in fact, later on in a same\nbusiness case with a case study,\n\n139\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.540\nyou will hear that service\nportfolio management doesn't exist.\n\n140\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.801\nSo, if the process called service\nportfolio management doesn't exist, and\n\n141\n00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:02.920\nthe catalog is well-maintained,\n\n142\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.110\nthen there's somewhat of a disconnect\non the maturity side of things.\n\n143\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.010\nIt doesn't mean the catalog\nis fully mature\n\n144\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.060\nif the server's portfolio management\nprocess is not fully mature.\n\n145\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.250\nOne more final thing about\nthe nature of this case study.\n\n146\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.827\nBe looking for the weaknesses as relates\nto the interactions among the processes.\n\n147\n00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:25.742\nBut this course is called\nManaging Across the Lifecycle.\n\n148\n00:07:25.742 --> 00:07:30.310\nWe've described it as being able to look\nfrom a 5,000 foot view at the service\n\n149\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.276\nmanagement landscape and understanding all\nthe intricacies among the various stages\n\n150\n00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:39.790\nand the various intricacies or\ntentacles among the different processes.\n\n151\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.010\nThat's what MALC has been exploring,\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.360\nPrior to this, we've kinda been in\nour little tunnels, our little silos.\n\n153\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.292\nWe need to look moralistically at this and\n\n154\n00:07:48.292 --> 00:07:50.454\nlook at the interactions\namong these things.\n\n155\n00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:55.191\nSo be keen as you're reading the case\nstudy to the points of interfaces between\n\n156\n00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:59.451\nthe stages, as well as the points\nof interfaces Among the processes.\n\n157\n00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:01.069\nAnd then collectively,\n\n158\n00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:06.410\nthe points of interface between the IT\nservice organization and the business.\n\n159\n00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.300\n&gt;&gt; And of course, at this point,\n\n160\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.350\nthey probably already have\nthe 26 processes down, yeah?\n\n161\n00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou've been exposed to all of them.\n\n162\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.700\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you've been exposed\nto all of them more than once.\n\n163\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.080\nFoundation exposed them.\n\n164\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.862\nAnd then, of course,\nyou've gone down the intermediate path and\n\n165\n00:08:18.862 --> 00:08:21.068\ngot further exposure to them,\nperfect, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:24.230\nSo before you even listen to\nthe rest of this episode, notice\n\n167\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.446\ntime to go along before you come here and\nlisten to me parse out this sample paper,\n\n168\n00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:33.490\nit'd be a good idea that you've already\ntaken this sample paper, sample paper one.\n\n169\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.910\nAnd before you take sample paper one,\n\n170\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.530\nit'd be a good idea that you've already\nparsed out this case study, right?\n\n171\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.505\nSo assuming you've done that,\n\n172\n00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:42.890\nyou're gonna get a lot more value\nout of this particular episode.\n\n173\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.000\nSo somewhat of a prerequisite there.\n\n174\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.290\nSo if you haven't done that yet,\njust click Pause.\n\n175\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.629\nGo out and enjoy that good study,\nand I'll see you in a few days.\n\n176\n00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:57.255\nCuz it's gonna take you some time,\nperhaps, to schedule that time,\n\n177\n00:08:57.255 --> 00:08:59.713\nto get that case study\nunder your belt well, and\n\n178\n00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:02.120\nto pace your way through\nthose ten questions.\n\n179\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.090\n&gt;&gt; And we'll wait for them.\n\n180\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:03.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll be right here.\n\n181\n00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:05.815\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Okay, they're back.\n\n182\n00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:07.065\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n183\n00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:09.670\nAll right, so now diving in.\n\n184\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.960\nYou'll remember my color-coding perhaps,\nfrom those other sample paper reviews.\n\n185\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.090\nThe blue text is text that's just\ndescribing the business context,\n\n186\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.560\nwhich is not the most critical for\nyour success on the exam questions.\n\n187\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.800\nThe red bits are the specific deficiency,\nor question, or task being asked.\n\n188\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.720\nAnd then, the green bits is the IT\nservice provider's context,\n\n189\n00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.670\nhow the IT service provider\nis viewing things.\n\n190\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.842\nVery important, the green text is\noften very critical to the success on\n\n191\n00:09:38.842 --> 00:09:42.598\na question, because it describes\nwhat potentially is strong,\n\n192\n00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:46.788\nor what potentially is weak, and\nmay lead you to the question later on.\n\n193\n00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:51.150\nBut notice in this particular example,\nand you'll find this over and over again,\n\n194\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.120\nthat there's no blue text, right?\n\n195\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.320\nOn the previous sample papers,\nthere was lots of blue text,\n\n196\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.820\nbecause the scenario is presented\nin the business context.\n\n197\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.820\nWell, the business context\nis almost exclusively\n\n198\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.660\nover yonder in that case study.\n\n199\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.425\nAgain, reinforcing the importance of\nthat case study, those six pages.\n\n200\n00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.715\nKnow that case study well,\nthat's the business context.\n\n201\n00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:12.685\nIt is relevant, right?\n\n202\n00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:18.177\nWhat the business is trying to do,\nwhat problems you're trying to solve,\n\n203\n00:10:18.177 --> 00:10:22.335\nare very clear, to some extent,\nin the case study.\n\n204\n00:10:22.335 --> 00:10:24.958\nThey become more clear as you\nparse through the scenarios and\n\n205\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.198\nthe questions themselves.\n\n206\n00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:31.195\nSo in this particular example, the\nspecific ask is that the CIO recognizes\n\n207\n00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:35.557\nthat among these eight things up\nhere that could be recommended,\n\n208\n00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:38.589\nnot all of them could be\ndone at the same time.\n\n209\n00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:41.880\nSo basically, you're gonna have to say,\nwhere should we begin first?\n\n210\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.990\nNow the way this question plays out,\nas we look at the answers,\n\n211\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.120\nis gonna be highly relevant.\n\n212\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.910\nWhat's gonna be highly relevant\nis the case study itself.\n\n213\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.599\nThe pain is being experienced there,\n\n214\n00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:58.110\nthe weaknesses that are being\nexperienced there are expressed there.\n\n215\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.230\nWhere should you begin, right?\n\n216\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.540\nSo as we do a compare and contrast now,\nin this, when we get to the answers,\n\n217\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.970\nthe green bits are correct,\nthe red bits are just wrong, right?\n\n218\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:13.603\nAnd the gold bits are kinda neutral,\nit's kinda [SOUND] not incorrect.\n\n219\n00:11:13.603 --> 00:11:14.479\n&gt;&gt; They're meh.\n\n220\n00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:15.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're meh.\n\n221\n00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:20.813\nThey're not incorrect, it's just\nnot relevant to this case study and\n\n222\n00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:23.440\nthe challenges therein.\n\n223\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.450\nSo just graphically speaking,\nbefore we get into details here.\n\n224\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.350\nNotice that question B, and\nquestion C, or answer B, and\n\n225\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.857\nanswer C, neither are perfect, right?\n\n226\n00:11:34.857 --> 00:11:38.260\nBoth of them have some meh in them.\n\n227\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.360\nSo you're gonna find,\nas you go to the rationale,\n\n228\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.490\nyou have that download available as well.\n\n229\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.702\nAs you go to the rationale,\nyou'll see that you're actually\n\n230\n00:11:46.702 --> 00:11:51.980\ndistinguishing between definite positives,\nand meh, neutrals, right?\n\n231\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.089\nIt just so\nhappens that C has more positives, or\n\n232\n00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:59.393\nless neutrals, if you will, than B.\n\n233\n00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:04.090\nNow you might think that means that\nthe test maker's being too subjective.\n\n234\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.046\nAnd I appreciate that argument very much,\n\n235\n00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:09.509\ncuz when I first looked at MALC,\nI said, my gosh, are you kidding?\n\n236\n00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:12.930\nI gotta get that nuance to my analysis?\n\n237\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.680\nWell, the answer is, yes.\n\n238\n00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.620\nAlso, reinforcing the importance of\nknowing that case study cold, right?\n\n239\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.440\nKnowing where the weaknesses are, and\n\n240\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.800\nknowing what the business is trying to do\nis going to influence what IT is doing.\n\n241\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.090\nNow I think that's fair.\n\n242\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.640\nAgain, as I took this the first\ntime I thought, are you kidding me?\n\n243\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.920\nThat nuance of analysis\nis gonna be required.\n\n244\n00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.840\nBut the answer is yes,\nand I thought about it.\n\n245\n00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.420\nIn real life, that happens, right?\n\n246\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.210\nIt is a nuanced approach.\n\n247\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.750\nYou don't necessarily have clear\nbright shining answers that says, yes,\n\n248\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.060\ngo this direction.\n\n249\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.740\nYou have to make some decisions\namong competing ideas.\n\n250\n00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.720\nSome of them are gray,\nright, and moving forward.\n\n251\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.651\nNow again, keeping in\nthe wheelhouse between a 5 and a 3,\n\n252\n00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.008\nhopefully you can do that.\n\n253\n00:12:58.008 --> 00:13:02.420\nIf you go to the full screen here,\nyou'll see that answers A and\n\n254\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.680\nD have a lot less green, right?\n\n255\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.470\nIn fact, answer A has a bit of red.\n\n256\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.405\nNow red happens to deal with number 8,\nso I wanna go back for\n\n257\n00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:17.672\na learning opportunity here to\nwhat number 8 actually states.\n\n258\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.440\nIt's hard to read, so\nI'll read it out loud to you.\n\n259\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.890\nNumber 8 says,\na single SDP should be created for\n\n260\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.810\nuse in all future bank acquisitions.\n\n261\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.560\nNow parsing that thing\nat a level of detail,\n\n262\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.810\nlook how much detail I have to get there.\n\n263\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.430\nYou know what a service design package is.\n\n264\n00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.410\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] service design package.\n\n265\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.748\n&gt;&gt; Right, it helps you ask and answer\nall the questions related to delivering\n\n266\n00:13:43.748 --> 00:13:49.210\nan IT service, or I should say,\ndesigning an IT service, not delivering.\n\n267\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.740\nTransition, then, will take that SDP and\nbring the service to life because all\n\n268\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.700\nthe good due diligence was\ndone at the design level.\n\n269\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.210\nBut the SDP is related to\nthe design of a service.\n\n270\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.290\nIt is not in any way related\nto bank acquisitions.\n\n271\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.240\nThat's a business process, right?\n\n272\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.188\nSo look at the detail that I could\nfind in object one, 8 is simply wrong.\n\n273\n00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:18.990\nSDPs are not used for\nbank acquisitions or business processes.\n\n274\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:24.930\nSDPs are used for IT service management\nreasons, not business reasons.\n\n275\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.880\nSo 8 is wrong.\n\n276\n00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.620\nNow it would've been really great if three\nof the four answers had number 8 listed,\n\n277\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.070\ncuz I could get rid of all three of those,\nand\n\n278\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.120\njust go to the one that\ndidn't have 8 listed.\n\n279\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.900\nBut you see how, as you're parsing through\na question and the answers, if you can\n\n280\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.404\nfind something egregious, it's gonna give\nyou a way to get rid of the three or\n\n281\n00:14:44.404 --> 00:14:49.220\nthe zero, I mean, sorry, the one answer or\nthe zero answer, probably, right?\n\n282\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.040\nSo look for the red, if you can.\n\n283\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.120\nAnd MALC is gonna be really good,\n\n284\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.770\nthe exam is gonna give you plenty of\nopportunities for lots of data points.\n\n285\n00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.913\nMaybe you can find the real\nbad ones early, and\n\n286\n00:15:01.913 --> 00:15:05.795\nget rid of them as an exam-taking\napproach, all right?\n\n287\n00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:09.586\nAnd then, again, the challenge here,\nnot parsing this out directly,\n\n288\n00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:13.312\nas you look at B and C, and you go to\nthe rationale, they will be saying,\n\n289\n00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:16.690\nvery specifically, whether it\nwas a positive or a neutral one.\n\n290\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.620\nAnd they'll describe neutral saying,\nwell, it's not a bad idea, but\n\n291\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.060\nit's not related to the case study.\n\n292\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.882\nSo as you parse through this exam,\n\n293\n00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:30.060\nyou're gonna reinforce the importance\nof understanding the details\n\n294\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.480\nof that case study, which is a very\ngood exercise in learning, by the way.\n\n295\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.920\nAs you go through these sample papers,\nyou are going to get more and\n\n296\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.980\nmore familiar with the nuances\nof that case study.\n\n297\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.432\nAnd even more important, you're going to\nget very familiar with the nuances of\n\n298\n00:15:45.432 --> 00:15:47.836\nthese dastardly test makers, all right?\n\n299\n00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:50.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, question two plays out, in a way,\n\n300\n00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:53.126\npretty straightforward,\nagain not much blue,\n\n301\n00:15:53.126 --> 00:15:55.480\nhardly any blue here at all, no blue.\n\n302\n00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.990\nBecause the case study has\nall the business context.\n\n303\n00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.110\nYou can't ignore it,\nyou gotta know that case study.\n\n304\n00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.070\nThe green bits are the IT\nservice providers context, and\n\n305\n00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.470\nthe red bits are the specific asks,\nor the specific deficiencies.\n\n306\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.330\nSo folks, on that, I highlighted in red\nthat internal users received a security\n\n307\n00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:20.020\nupdate to the desktop, which resulted in\nsignificant incidents for the HQ staff.\n\n308\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.147\nSo a security update went out and\npeople said, what's going on here,\n\n309\n00:16:23.147 --> 00:16:25.851\nthey're calling the service desk saying,\nwhats going on?\n\n310\n00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:30.960\nHQ staff is upset because something\nhappened and we're not sure what went on.\n\n311\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.427\nIt later goes on to set when an email\nwent out, an email went out and\n\n312\n00:16:36.427 --> 00:16:38.367\ntold them it was gonna happen.\n\n313\n00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:42.700\nHowever, many of the IT staff did\nnot even understand what the policy.\n\n314\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.130\nSo we got a communication issue here,\neffectively.\n\n315\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.240\nAnd that's what this boils down to\nis effective communication planning.\n\n316\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:56.620\nAnd we had a good little episode\nearlier about communications and\n\n317\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.760\nit's trying to reinforce the importance\nof effective communications.\n\n318\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.140\nAnd they give you an excerpt\nof the existing plan.\n\n319\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.145\nIt says that the CEO has assigned\nyou to evaluate a key part\n\n320\n00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:11.227\nof the existing IT communication\nplan which is shown below.\n\n321\n00:17:11.227 --> 00:17:12.797\nAnd then, it just simply says,\n\n322\n00:17:12.797 --> 00:17:15.990\nthe strategic communication\nplan is somewhere else.\n\n323\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.030\nSo you´re not gonna be looking,\nit does exist,\n\n324\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.820\nthe strategic communication\nplan does exist somewhere.\n\n325\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.180\nBut this becomes the focus.\n\n326\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.450\nSo don´t worry about the lack\nof a strategic plan.\n\n327\n00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.000\nCuz that's one of\nthe communication principles, too.\n\n328\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.440\nHave a strategy before you have your plan.\n\n329\n00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.680\nSo they're saying, we've got that covered.\n\n330\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.250\nThere is a strategy over here.\n\n331\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.660\nThis is the focus is what\nwe're coming down to here.\n\n332\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.401\nSo basically you have to identify and\ngo through what they've currently done.\n\n333\n00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:48.630\nIt says row 1, the CIO is the one\nthat's gonna be the messenger.\n\n334\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.360\nAnd he's going to send\nit to IT unit managers.\n\n335\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.710\nThe message that's supposed to\nbe delivered, in this case,\n\n336\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.070\nthe importance of complying with new and\nchanged policies, it's not silly broken.\n\n337\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.710\nMethod of communication.\n\n338\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.190\nMeetings, date and frequency\nthroughout the service life cycle.\n\n339\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.000\nSo it's a typical plan here.\n\n340\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.220\nHow often are we gonna do it?\n\n341\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.890\nClearly, the mark was missed.\n\n342\n00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.990\nUsers didn't know, staff didn't even know.\n\n343\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.570\nAnd the security team said,\nwell, we sent out an email.\n\n344\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.530\nA bit of a shortfall.\n\n345\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.610\nSo how could this have been approved?\n\n346\n00:18:22.742 --> 00:18:27.582\nAgain, you'll see a case at least in\nthis case where there is clear right and\n\n347\n00:18:27.582 --> 00:18:28.500\nclear wrong.\n\n348\n00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.890\nAgain, it's obvious now that I've parched\nit through and gone through the rationale.\n\n349\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.804\nThat the D answer has everything right.\n\n350\n00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:39.359\nThey're saying add the ITT managers.\n\n351\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.540\nSo before, all they had was IT\nunit managers and all IT staff,\n\n352\n00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.780\nso now you're adding to row 1,\nITT managers.\n\n353\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.730\nMake sure they're part of the target\naudience cuz they claimed, according to\n\n354\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.350\nthis particular scenario, many IT staff\ndid not understand the new policy,\n\n355\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.260\nIT team leaders weren't aware, etc.\n\n356\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.970\nSo they're describing all the symptoms, so\n\n357\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.380\nattack those symptoms is what\nyou're trying to do here.\n\n358\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.915\nNotice C.\n\n359\n00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:13.443\nLet's see if we can find why\nthey're pretty bright red.\n\n360\n00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:15.550\nAnd obviously I've already\nmade the determination.\n\n361\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.318\nPerhaps, you've read the rationale, but\n\n362\n00:19:17.318 --> 00:19:19.722\nI want to try to make this\na learning opportunity, as well.\n\n363\n00:19:19.722 --> 00:19:25.590\nIn C, change the target audience for CIO\ncommunication to the IT steering group.\n\n364\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.960\nSo here you have the CIO talking\nto the senior executives\n\n365\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.010\nof the organization\nabout a security update.\n\n366\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.430\nDo you think those senior executives\nreally wanna bother themselves with\n\n367\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.800\nthe task?\n\n368\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.030\nWith the understanding of\nthey may be a recipient and\n\n369\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.800\nthey're gonna get the security update,\nbut do you wanna have the CIO go to\n\n370\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.490\nthe steering group and say,\nthere's a security update coming.\n\n371\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.590\nIt's a security update,\nit's not a strategic decision, so\n\n372\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.820\nthis is kinda getting back to\nthe nuance of right audience,\n\n373\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.090\nright message,\nthe steering group is not the place you go\n\n374\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.850\nto talk about these types of day\nto day operational activities.\n\n375\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.080\nThe steering group is the place you go\nto discuss strategic important things.\n\n376\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.510\nImportant things from a strategic level.\n\n377\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.939\nSo you can see how subtle\nwe're getting now.\n\n378\n00:20:13.939 --> 00:20:16.240\nNow, do you consider that subjective?\n\n379\n00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.950\nNow, I don't myself.\n\n380\n00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.390\nI think as taking a mastering across\nthe life cycle, the expert exam,\n\n381\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.880\nif you will, you need to be able to\nhave strategic thinking in your mind.\n\n382\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.710\nAnd effectively what is,\nis a strategic mindset.\n\n383\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.560\nYou're looking at the big picture.\n\n384\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.740\n&gt;&gt; The 5,000, foot view.\n\n385\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.400\n&gt;&gt; The 5,000 foot view and\noperating at a strategic level.\n\n386\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.030\nSo if you're unable to recognize the\n[INAUDIBLE] group is not the appropriate\n\n387\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.690\nplace for tactical decisions.\n\n388\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.130\nAnd it's not.\n\n389\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.150\nThen, maybe you missed a good lesson,\nit's what the test maker say, and\n\n390\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.530\nI'm not saying this, the test makers\nsay this is something you should have\n\n391\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.680\npicked up by the time\nyou got to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n392\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.390\nSo again, trying to weigh\nin the subtleties here, but\n\n393\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.260\nthe importance of it here.\n\n394\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.790\nAgain, highlighting on the red\nkinda gives you an idea of what\n\n395\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.760\nthe test maker is thinking, and\nthat's a learning opportunity.\n\n396\n00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.940\nNot only learning subject matter but\n\n397\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.380\nlearning how the test maker\nviews these concepts.\n\n398\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.610\nBecause those same concepts could\ncome up later in other questions,\n\n399\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.955\neven on the real exam.\n\n400\n00:21:19.955 --> 00:21:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n401\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Good idea there.\n\n402\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.870\nLooking at some of the red bits.\n\n403\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.688\nWhat's wrong with the first one in B?\n\n404\n00:21:26.688 --> 00:21:30.840\nIn row 1, change the message to\nimportance of complying with new and\n\n405\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.250\nchanged policies to maintain\nregulatory compliance\n\n406\n00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.070\nby following the knowledge\nmanagement process.\n\n407\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:44.490\nFollowing a process to go do these other\nthings is not the scope of this issue.\n\n408\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.630\nThe scope of this issue was that\ncommunication about the security update\n\n409\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.970\nwas not clear enough to the people\nthat received the update.\n\n410\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.230\nAnd it caused them concerns.\n\n411\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.740\nThey didn't know what to do, so\na lot of issues came up with it.\n\n412\n00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.500\nIt's not because the knowledge\nmanagement process wasn't followed.\n\n413\n00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.928\nIt's because communication was poor.\n\n414\n00:22:06.928 --> 00:22:09.957\nSo coming up and say, hey, everyone,\npay attention to your email,\n\n415\n00:22:09.957 --> 00:22:13.000\nis the most important knowledge\nmanagements process we have.\n\n416\n00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.260\nI mean, that's just kinda silly.\n\n417\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.854\nAgain, maybe easy for me to say.\n\n418\n00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:20.350\nI've parched this question a few times.\n\n419\n00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:26.370\nBut, again, chasing a knowledge management\ngoal through an email communication\n\n420\n00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.070\nrelated to a security update\nis really kinda wormy.\n\n421\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.140\nAnother red one here on B.\n\n422\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.100\nAdding new activity, maybe appropriate.\n\n423\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.200\nAdd a new activity to the table as row 3.\n\n424\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.040\nTo find out how many people\nare affected by the change cycle\n\n425\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.760\nin order to establish the target audience.\n\n426\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.290\nAs part of the communication plan,\n\n427\n00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.170\nyou're trying to ascertain what\nneeds to be communicate to whom.\n\n428\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.520\nThe strategy which is over here somewhere,\n\n429\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.710\nthey talked about\nthe strategy being available.\n\n430\n00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.705\nThe strategy we talk about,\nwhat message do we need to have,\n\n431\n00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:06.138\nwhat information do we have to make\nthe appropriate messages, etc.\n\n432\n00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:09.210\nThat's what the strategic aspect of it is.\n\n433\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.500\nSo this is the wrong deliverable for that.\n\n434\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.550\nHaving a communication plan is about\nwhat message are you gonna send to whom.\n\n435\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.980\nNot how you're gonna get information to\nfind out what information to send to whom.\n\n436\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:27.439\nThat's just misaligning what a strategy\nis, and what a communication plan is.\n\n437\n00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:32.180\nAgain, A might be compelling and I think\nthis is where it gets kinda devilish.\n\n438\n00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:36.846\nIs that D has two greens but A has\nthe first one which is not necessarily\n\n439\n00:23:36.846 --> 00:23:41.838\nwrong but just kinda neutral where it\nsays row 1 does not need to be changed\n\n440\n00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:46.609\nas it is important for all IT unit\nmanagers to understand the changes.\n\n441\n00:23:46.609 --> 00:23:49.593\nWell, it is important for\nan IT unit manager so\n\n442\n00:23:49.593 --> 00:23:54.210\nyou can compare the first one in A to\nthe first one and D and at least C.\n\n443\n00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.961\nWhat we're maintaining the unit managers,\nwe're just adding another Stakeholder.\n\n444\n00:23:57.961 --> 00:23:59.882\nSo that's probably better.\n\n445\n00:23:59.882 --> 00:24:03.070\nI'll say this thematically\nabout communications.\n\n446\n00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.664\nThe answer that is more inclusive is\nprobably going to be the better answer\n\n447\n00:24:07.664 --> 00:24:10.342\nthan one that is not as inclusive, right?\n\n448\n00:24:10.342 --> 00:24:15.361\nBeing inclusive is a big part of\neffective communication, right.\n\n449\n00:24:15.361 --> 00:24:21.040\nAll right, question three,\nagain, no blue bits.\n\n450\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.720\nThey're over in the case study.\n\n451\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.690\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We've got green and red here.\n\n452\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.577\nAnd the specific ask in this one is, the\nCIO has asked you to create a report that\n\n453\n00:24:28.577 --> 00:24:31.997\nexplains the importance of\nformal SDP's to the bank.\n\n454\n00:24:31.997 --> 00:24:36.273\nNow I like when these things happen,\nthese kind of questions happen,\n\n455\n00:24:36.273 --> 00:24:40.550\nbecause it almost gets to the theoretical,\nthe book learning.\n\n456\n00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.330\nYou're not necessarily having to\n\n457\n00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:47.320\nsynthesize a lot you just\nneed to repeat a lot.\n\n458\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.680\nGenerally speaking if you're asked to\ngo tell the value of an SDP, you're\n\n459\n00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.740\nbasically reading from the book about\nthe value of an SDP, basically, right.\n\n460\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.230\nSo these questions tend\nto be a little easier\n\n461\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.620\nbecause they don't require\nas much synthesis.\n\n462\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.810\nBut that said,\n\n463\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.320\nI say tend to be, you still need to\nkeep the case study in mind, right.\n\n464\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.870\nThe principles of an SDP, the value of\nan SDP need to be preserved in your answer\n\n465\n00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.670\nbut you also need to understand\nthe specific aspects of this organization.\n\n466\n00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.820\nSo, as we look at this one, man,\nlook at all the data points there.\n\n467\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.554\nImpossible to read here on the screen,\nso look at your own,\n\n468\n00:25:21.554 --> 00:25:22.413\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:25:22.413 --> 00:25:24.301\n&gt;&gt; Look at your own printout there.\n\n470\n00:25:24.301 --> 00:25:25.789\n&gt;&gt; Or pause [LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:31.577\n&gt;&gt; Right now, again,\ncan you find a blatant bad one?\n\n472\n00:25:31.577 --> 00:25:34.270\nRight, there's a lot of things\nto read there, and here you are.\n\n473\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.650\nAnother thing about time management, look\nhow many things you got to read, right?\n\n474\n00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.148\nSo, there's two hours, you get an extra\n30 minutes for two more questions.\n\n475\n00:25:41.148 --> 00:25:45.040\nYou can see pretty quickly how you\ncould use up that time just evaluating\n\n476\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.010\nall of these particular data points.\n\n477\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.370\nAgain, I kind of made it easy, because\nI've already done the parsing of this.\n\n478\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.270\nBut I see a red one here,\n\n479\n00:25:54.270 --> 00:26:00.330\nit says having clear design acceptance\ncriteria to reduce failed questions.\n\n480\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.810\nHaving clear design acceptance criteria.\n\n481\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.970\nI've never heard the term\ndesign acceptance criteria.\n\n482\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.900\nThe actual term used by service design\nis service acceptance criteria.\n\n483\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.100\nSo I'm a little suspect on that one,\nit's probably wrong because\n\n484\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.870\nI had never heard of such a thing\nas designed acceptance criteria.\n\n485\n00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:27.090\nSo I can eliminate, cuz it's just simply\nwrong, I can eliminate answers c and\n\n486\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:31.030\nd because they include a reference to\nsomething that I've never heard of.\n\n487\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.340\nSo again,\nas you parse these things, I do so\n\n488\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.630\nby a process of elimination, if I can\nfind something that's particularly wrong.\n\n489\n00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:45.712\nI wanna go back just to remind you,\nremember we had this one for row eight.\n\n490\n00:26:45.712 --> 00:26:50.670\nRow eight, a single STP should be created\nfor use of all future bank applications.\n\n491\n00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.160\nThat was a wrong statement\nin the table before.\n\n492\n00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.610\nIf any answer has that one,\nlet's get rid of it.\n\n493\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.168\nWell, in this case,\nI found something dubious, and\n\n494\n00:27:00.168 --> 00:27:02.234\nI could get rid of two answers.\n\n495\n00:27:02.234 --> 00:27:05.742\nSo, I got rid of C and D,\nthey're not going to be the five answer.\n\n496\n00:27:07.379 --> 00:27:12.240\nRight, not gonna be there, so now I only\nhave to evaluate and compare A and B.\n\n497\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.101\nJust by finding one that's dubious, I've\ngotten rid of some right, a good approach.\n\n498\n00:27:18.101 --> 00:27:21.111\n&gt;&gt; You see what I mean when I say,\nbe a Sherlock, Terry.\n\n499\n00:27:21.111 --> 00:27:22.033\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You are.\n\n500\n00:27:22.033 --> 00:27:23.056\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Breaking it down.\n\n501\n00:27:23.056 --> 00:27:26.681\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Breaking it down, that's right.\n\n502\n00:27:26.681 --> 00:27:30.779\nSo as you, now since all you have to do\nis compare A and B, now I will say this,\n\n503\n00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:35.284\nlook how challenging, the color-coding\nis telling you how challenging this is.\n\n504\n00:27:35.284 --> 00:27:38.707\nB has nothing that is wrong right,\n\n505\n00:27:38.707 --> 00:27:43.320\nB has some green bits and\nit has some gold bits.\n\n506\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.366\nRemember, the gold bits are just\nones that are kind of neutral.\n\n507\n00:27:45.366 --> 00:27:46.100\n&gt;&gt; Meh.\n\n508\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:51.012\n&gt;&gt; Meh, right, they are not directly\nrelated to the business case or\n\n509\n00:27:51.012 --> 00:27:53.490\nthe case study or this scenario.\n\n510\n00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.330\nSo, that gets to be kind of persnickety.\n\n511\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.262\nAgain, you're going to be involved\nin this persnickety game.\n\n512\n00:27:58.262 --> 00:28:05.118\nYou're going to be involved in evaluating,\ngood from meh right?\n\n513\n00:28:05.118 --> 00:28:07.028\nAnd that´s clearly what\nit comes down to here.\n\n514\n00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:08.450\n&gt;&gt; And we want good.\n\n515\n00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:12.570\n&gt;&gt; So the good news about this particular\nquestion is, you got rid of c and d.\n\n516\n00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.530\nSo you´re going to get a three\nanswer here, at least.\n\n517\n00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.110\nWhich is a good place to be,\nevaluating between the fives and\n\n518\n00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.880\nthe threes is a better place to be than\ntrying to guess between a five and a zero.\n\n519\n00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.260\nAnd we just got rid of\nthe CND ones here all right.\n\n520\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.540\nJust as another example of how you\ncan parse these things through.\n\n521\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.094\nNow let's look at a little\nbit of detail here.\n\n522\n00:28:34.094 --> 00:28:39.907\nAnd they're all under rationale but\nyou'll see that B has a few greens and\n\n523\n00:28:39.907 --> 00:28:43.021\nonly a few, quiet a few golds, right.\n\n524\n00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:46.728\nThe nature of that is born\nout in the rational so\n\n525\n00:28:46.728 --> 00:28:50.339\nI'm not going to rehash that a whole lot,\nbut\n\n526\n00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:56.250\nremember that unless it's approaching\nthe real needs of this business.\n\n527\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.692\nAs described in the case study or\n\n528\n00:28:58.692 --> 00:29:04.680\nunless it's approaching the real issues\nas described within the case study.\n\n529\n00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.237\nThen it's probably more of\na meh on the answer, right?\n\n530\n00:29:08.237 --> 00:29:13.864\nLet's see if I can find a direct one there\nthat kinda says, deployment plans that\n\n531\n00:29:13.864 --> 00:29:19.770\nspecify required testing allowing better\nchange scheduling, that very fist one.\n\n532\n00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.538\nI recall from reading the case study\nthat they were rather proud about how\n\n533\n00:29:25.538 --> 00:29:27.411\nthey could do this testing.\n\n534\n00:29:27.411 --> 00:29:30.160\nThey had a pretty mature and robust piece.\n\n535\n00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.975\nNow that doesn't mean It's\nnot subject to improvement.\n\n536\n00:29:32.975 --> 00:29:37.495\nIt doesn't mean that the SDP couldn't be\nan important factor in making it better.\n\n537\n00:29:37.495 --> 00:29:39.785\nSo it's not wrong right?\n\n538\n00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:43.345\nThe reason it's gold is\nbecause the case study\n\n539\n00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:46.795\nwas fairly explicit in talking\nabout this particular capability.\n\n540\n00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:48.655\nSo it's not a pain you\nhave to put salve on.\n\n541\n00:29:50.085 --> 00:29:52.025\nNow let's put that in a operational sense.\n\n542\n00:29:52.025 --> 00:29:53.945\nYou have been asked by the CIO to go and\n\n543\n00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:59.540\npresent some information\nregarding the value of the SDP.\n\n544\n00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.440\nSo why would you present information\nat that particular meeting\n\n545\n00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.720\nregarding the value of the SDP as\nrelated to testing if its already known\n\n546\n00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.450\nthat testing is in a good place, right?\n\n547\n00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.580\nIt just doesn't make sense to go and\n\n548\n00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.940\nbring that noise if you will,\nto that given meeting.\n\n549\n00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.690\nSo there is operational relevance,\nnot just academic relevance to this.\n\n550\n00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.700\nSometimes it's hard for me to parse out\nthe difference between the academics and\n\n551\n00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.640\nthe operations, I have to admit that.\n\n552\n00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.250\nBut in this particular case it wasn't\ntoo hard for that first line anyway for\n\n553\n00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.010\nme to see that, you know what,\nas relates to this particular business,\n\n554\n00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.380\ntesting is not the most\ncritical thing to work on.\n\n555\n00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.740\nThat value proposition will not resonate.\n\n556\n00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.830\nIt's not wrong, it's just not right,\nnot just perfect for it.\n\n557\n00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.640\nAll right, moving forward then.\n\n558\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.680\nThis one, again, no blue bits\nthat's over in the case study.\n\n559\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.250\nThe green bits are describing the IT\nservice provider's context and\n\n560\n00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.630\nthe red bits are looking\nat the specific ask.\n\n561\n00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:02.220\nIn this case the specific ask is\neffectively this isolates most operational\n\n562\n00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.760\nstaff from direct interaction with\nother parts of the service lifecycle.\n\n563\n00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.730\nOperational staff is isolated, right.\n\n564\n00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.010\nYou are the IT operations manager and\nyou believe that the current policy\n\n565\n00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.960\nof always focus on availability,\nthat's what's in the green bits.\n\n566\n00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.970\nThe current policy of always focusing\non the availability is outdated and\n\n567\n00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:21.880\nshould be replaced.\n\n568\n00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.430\nSo one of the examples we're\nmissing in the episode on involving\n\n569\n00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:31.680\noperation staff really dealt with\nthe scenario played out in such a way that\n\n570\n00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.610\nthey focused on just fixing\nthings all the time.\n\n571\n00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.730\nThey were blamed, why are you so\nbad at availability, right?\n\n572\n00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.662\nBlaming operation's staff, I say blaming,\nmaking the operation staff going through\n\n573\n00:31:43.662 --> 00:31:46.336\nthe churn of putting out\nthe fires all the time.\n\n574\n00:31:46.336 --> 00:31:50.320\nThey're under the thumb of measurements.\n\n575\n00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.769\nWow, availability is bad.\nWhat are you doing about that today,\n\n576\n00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:53.731\noperations, what are you doing\nabout that today operations?\n\n577\n00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:57.438\nWhen actually, that could be something\nfixed upstream in either service\n\n578\n00:31:57.438 --> 00:32:00.020\ntransition or in service design.\n\n579\n00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:06.100\nSo that's the crux of this matter, getting\noperations people involved upstream.\n\n580\n00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.928\nSure, they're gonna be involved here, but\nhow should they be involved upstream to\n\n581\n00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:15.290\naffect improvements at all the levels,\nof all the stages in the life cycle?\n\n582\n00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.520\nThat's the crux of this one.\n\n583\n00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:23.917\nSo the academic nugget, operations\nshould be involved in all stages,\n\n584\n00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:25.815\neffectively is what it is.\n\n585\n00:32:25.815 --> 00:32:30.120\nIs there any one answer that gets\nthem involved in all stages?\n\n586\n00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.207\nAnd C happens to be one that does that,\nright?\n\n587\n00:32:33.207 --> 00:32:37.127\nAnswer C gets involved at the strategic\nlevel, gets involved at the design level,\n\n588\n00:32:37.127 --> 00:32:40.216\ngets involved at transition and\ngets involved in improvements.\n\n589\n00:32:40.216 --> 00:32:44.525\nMm-hm, right, so it's pretty good that,\n\n590\n00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:46.915\nlet's look at the red ones cuz it's so\nwrong if you will.\n\n591\n00:32:46.915 --> 00:32:48.845\nIt's all red, is it obviously wrong?\n\n592\n00:32:48.845 --> 00:32:50.665\nCan you eliminate the bad ones?\n\n593\n00:32:50.665 --> 00:32:53.485\nAnd what it focuses on is operations.\n\n594\n00:32:53.485 --> 00:32:55.205\nIndicate operational risks for\n\n595\n00:32:55.205 --> 00:33:00.765\nnew IT strategy being developed which will\nintroduce contracted development services.\n\n596\n00:33:00.765 --> 00:33:03.645\nIntroduce contracted development services.\n\n597\n00:33:03.645 --> 00:33:05.855\nThat's jumping back to\na solution first of all,\n\n598\n00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:08.465\nthat's jumping to we should\noutsource our development.\n\n599\n00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.470\nWho said, how does operations just\njump to that conclusion, right?\n\n600\n00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.184\nIf you look at the other one,\nit's about assessment and\n\n601\n00:33:17.184 --> 00:33:19.221\nbringing data to the decisions, right.\n\n602\n00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:24.563\nBringing information, bringing things that\nyou know not opinions you have, right?\n\n603\n00:33:24.563 --> 00:33:28.861\nAnd you don't know that contract\ndevelopment services is the right way to\n\n604\n00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:33.016\ngo, there is nothing to suggest in\nthe business case, the case study,\n\n605\n00:33:33.016 --> 00:33:34.282\nthe scenario, etc.\n\n606\n00:33:34.282 --> 00:33:37.295\nDevelop appropriate cost models.\n\n607\n00:33:37.295 --> 00:33:41.200\nOperations doesn't develop the cost\nmodels, they provide data, so\n\n608\n00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.270\nthe appropriate cost\nmodels can be developed.\n\n609\n00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.640\nSo you see how B is just\nshaping up to be wrong-headed.\n\n610\n00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.940\nIt's not making operations\ndo service design work.\n\n611\n00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.630\nIt's not making operations\ndo service strategy work.\n\n612\n00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:59.530\nThe goal is to make operations available\nso that that work can be done effectively.\n\n613\n00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.180\nThat's really what it is.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n614\n00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:05.200\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nA is kinda neutral kind of meh as is D.\n\n615\n00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360\nNot blatantly wrong,\nnot blatantly correct.\n\n616\n00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.780\nThe rationale that you get\nfleshes that out quite a bit.\n\n617\n00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.178\nFind, the easy lying fruit sometimes\nis getting rid of the bad answers.\n\n618\n00:34:16.178 --> 00:34:21.090\nAnd then rehoning on the differences\nbetween the meh and the good.\n\n619\n00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.480\n&gt;&gt; Makes a lot of sense, all right.\n\n620\n00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.190\n&gt;&gt; That's a pretty good swath of this.\n\n621\n00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.810\n&gt;&gt; It is, yep.\n\n622\n00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good swath of this but\nwe got quite a few more questions to go.\n\n623\n00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.510\nWe gotta get five through ten.\n\n624\n00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.697\nWe'll pick that up in another episode.\n\n625\n00:34:32.697 --> 00:34:35.945\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so ITIL malk,\nsample paper review,\n\n626\n00:34:35.945 --> 00:34:38.980\nthere will be a part two,\nmaybe a part three.\n\n627\n00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.710\nWe'll have to see,\n\n628\n00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.380\ncuz we wanna make sure that we turn\nover every rock, right, Terry?\n\n629\n00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.780\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job as always.\n\n630\n00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.690\nHey, thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n631\n00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.950\nYou know a good ITPro is always learning.\n\n632\n00:34:48.950 -->

00:00:08.453\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:12.210\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.248\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.378\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.378 --> 00:00:19.490\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n8\n00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.055\nas we continue on with ITIL MALC\nsample paper review, part two.\n\n9\n00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:27.123\nSo if you haven't seen part one\nmake sure you do, review it and\n\n10\n00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:28.599\nthen come on back to part two.\n\n11\n00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.435\nWho's giving us all the information?\n\n12\n00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:33.395\nTerry Decker the man who\nknows pretty much everything.\n\n13\n00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.448\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Everything absolutely.\n\n14\n00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.350\n&gt;&gt; Everything.\n&gt;&gt; Everything,\n\n15\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.784\n&gt;&gt; As we continue through this exposure\n\n16\n00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:45.074\nto sample paper one, and diving deep into\nthe techniques for succeeding on this.\n\n17\n00:00:45.074 --> 00:00:49.116\nI wanna remind you of something that\ntalked about in the general exam,\n\n18\n00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:49.945\ntaking tips.\n\n19\n00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:53.907\nAnd I wanna reinforce\nhere is that new data,\n\n20\n00:00:53.907 --> 00:00:59.710\nnew facts should not be exposed\nin the answer that you choose.\n\n21\n00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.290\nWhat I mean by that is\nthe facts are in the scenario.\n\n22\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.760\nThe facts are in the case\nstudy as you go to MALC.\n\n23\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.750\nSo the facts are in the case study.\n\n24\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.455\nThe facts are in the scenario but\nnew facts introduced in\n\n25\n00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:16.672\nan answer is a reach,\nit's an assumption right.\n\n26\n00:01:16.672 --> 00:01:22.067\nSo don't let new facts be\nconsidered as truth in the answers.\n\n27\n00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:26.910\nThat is a red herring that says stay\naway from me, don't go down this path.\n\n28\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.881\n&gt;&gt; You won't be getting any extra\ncredit for doing such a thing.\n\n29\n00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.595\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that is an assumption.\n\n30\n00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:34.220\nThat's not a new fact,\nthat is an assumption of a fact.\n\n31\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.875\nFacts show up in the case study,\nfacts show up in the scenario,\n\n32\n00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:37.800\nwe'll remind you of that.\n\n33\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.105\nAnd as it relates to MALC,\nthe facts there is lots of them,\n\n34\n00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:45.160\nthere's lots them in the case study,\nyou've got six pages.\n\n35\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.830\nYou've got long scenario-based questions,\nthat are also playing into this.\n\n36\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.568\nSo remember that as you go along as well,\nokay.\n\n37\n00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:57.110\nAgain, now diving deep\ninto question five here.\n\n38\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.050\nAgain following the same\nprotocols I did before,\n\n39\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.030\nhighlighting the specific asks and\nthe specific deficiencies.\n\n40\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.395\nIn this case you're the knowledge\nmanagement owner, process owner.\n\n41\n00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.754\nYou've been recently appointed.\n\n42\n00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:14.280\nYou want to implement a new\nformal knowledge management\n\n43\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.660\nprocess across the life cycle,\nso holistically view here.\n\n44\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.660\nYou have some constraints\nto operate in and\n\n45\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.260\nsome challenges the acknowledge\nmanagement process needs to be delivered\n\n46\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.800\nwithin the banks regulatory and\nsecurity constraints.\n\n47\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.299\nDisposal of information is\nrecognized as a challenge.\n\n48\n00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.931\nSo there's new facts, you're recognized.\n\n49\n00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:39.470\nThen maybe that didn't play out in the\ncase study fully but there's a new fact,\n\n50\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.221\nit's totally legitimate to\nconsider that as good fact, right.\n\n51\n00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:47.530\nThe next task for the project is to\ndevelop a knowledge management policy that\n\n52\n00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.260\nsupports the purpose of\nknowledge management.\n\n53\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.945\nYou're working with key stake holders\nto develop this policy a knowledge\n\n54\n00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:55.180\nmanagement policy.\n\n55\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.380\nWhat should a policy look like?\n\n56\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.561\nSo we're talking about the governance\nnow related to knowledge management as\n\n57\n00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:07.225\na whole within the specific challenges of\ndata retention or record retention, etc.\n\n58\n00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:11.145\nNow, my goodness look at\nthe color treatment I got here.\n\n59\n00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:16.163\nA and B are both completely green.\n\n60\n00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; My goodness gracious.\n\n61\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.539\nSo not only are they all good or\nneutral, they're all good right.\n\n62\n00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.366\nNow C has a green with little neutrality.\n\n63\n00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:29.408\nAnd D is simply just off, it's all red.\n\n64\n00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:32.469\nSo hopefully you can get rid\nof that D one pretty quick.\n\n65\n00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:37.567\nHopefully that was a good place for\nyou to start for elimination.\n\n66\n00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:42.495\nNow as I look at two answers that are all\ngreen I'm gonna be highly suspicious\n\n67\n00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.579\nof a test maker honestly, I am.\n\n68\n00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.870\nI'm gonna say, how could you get, I mean\nthere's gotta be subjectivity here, right?\n\n69\n00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.810\nAnd again exams are supposed\nto be objective.\n\n70\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.290\nThere has to be some\nsubjectivity here right,\n\n71\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.100\nI think when I see two green answers.\n\n72\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.720\nSo I get it,\nI understand the challenge and\n\n73\n00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.470\nwe can get mad at the test\nmaker if we want.\n\n74\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.090\nThis particular one I never really\ncompletely purge my anger over\n\n75\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.050\nthat subjectivity to tell you the truth.\n\n76\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.562\nBut I kinda get the rationale,\nI see, I kinda get.\n\n77\n00:04:13.562 --> 00:04:17.145\nSo when I approach a question\nlike this on a sample papers and\n\n78\n00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:19.160\nyou'll get this occasionally.\n\n79\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.687\nWhen I approach a question like this on\nthe sample papers, what I do to kinda,\n\n80\n00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:25.689\na spoonful of sugar,\nwe talked about that in previous episodes.\n\n81\n00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:32.075\nTo let this bad medicine go down is that\nI look at it as an opportunity to learn,\n\n82\n00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:32.690\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.432\nReinforce the concepts I'm\nsupposed to reinforce.\n\n84\n00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:40.090\nAnd reinforce this idea that\ntest makers can be fallible.\n\n85\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.564\nAnd they can, they can be.\n\n86\n00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:44.550\nWhich is not a bad thing,\nyou can be smarter than a test maker.\n\n87\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.420\nSo that's not a bad thing.\n\n88\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.322\nIt's just a opportunity to get\na nuanced learning opportunity and\n\n89\n00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:51.861\nthat's what this one is.\n\n90\n00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:53.430\nIt's a very nuanced learning opportunity.\n\n91\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.780\nSo take that opportunity,\nfigure out that nuance.\n\n92\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.476\nAnd be able to recognize such\nnuance on future exam questions,\n\n93\n00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:03.419\nsuch as on the real exam,\nwe'll takeaway there.\n\n94\n00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.595\nSo let's look at the key difference here.\n\n95\n00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:10.389\nI think it really is subtle, but\nwhat this one comes down to is\n\n96\n00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.090\nanswer A as you read it talks\nabout language and time zones.\n\n97\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:24.110\nAnswer B only talks about,\nI believe time zones or vice versa.\n\n98\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.257\nSo are time zones important?\n\n99\n00:05:27.257 --> 00:05:29.428\nAre they difficult to manage?\n\n100\n00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:32.983\nIntrinsic in this idea of time\nzone is also cultural gaps,\n\n101\n00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:34.520\nnot just language gaps.\n\n102\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.093\nSo as you're embarking on\nan international organization,\n\n103\n00:05:38.093 --> 00:05:41.392\nwhich this company is this\nbank is expanding globally.\n\n104\n00:05:41.392 --> 00:05:46.133\nOne of the challenges explicitly mentioned\nwas the challenge of culture and\n\n105\n00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.292\nlanguage and time zones, right.\n\n106\n00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:52.695\nSo the subtle difference between A and\nB in this particular case,\n\n107\n00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:58.425\nis that one is more inclusive of the real\nchallenges, which is not just language,\n\n108\n00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:03.230\nnot just time zones language and\ntime zones so it's not wrong.\n\n109\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.924\nIt's not even neutral because\nit does apply to the case study.\n\n110\n00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:08.152\nJust one was a bit broader.\n\n111\n00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:12.601\nSo I give them credit, the test\nmakers I say, I give them credit for\n\n112\n00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:15.631\nthis to challenge me\nto think holistically.\n\n113\n00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:19.588\nNot just find the first answer\nthat satisfies the good but\n\n114\n00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.976\nevaluate them and\nsee which one's a bit fuller.\n\n115\n00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:25.014\nAnd that's what you'll find as\nin there's between A and B.\n\n116\n00:06:25.014 --> 00:06:25.517\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n117\n00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:26.283\n&gt;&gt; Subtle.\n\n118\n00:06:26.283 --> 00:06:27.979\n&gt;&gt; And then it's a five and\na three, right?\n\n119\n00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:28.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n120\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.507\n&gt;&gt; That's a five and\na three, that's right.\n\n121\n00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:31.007\nGood point all right.\n\n122\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.629\nAgain, I never did completely swallow\nmy anger for the test makers for\n\n123\n00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:37.604\nnot take a question.\n\n124\n00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:39.341\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But I do get the idea and\n\n125\n00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:43.553\nthat's an important idea to take\nforward as you take other questions is\n\n126\n00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:47.630\nthat the best answer could be the one\nhas a bit more folders to it.\n\n127\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.856\nIt covered all the details\nnot just the subset of, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:52.856 --> 00:06:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n129\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.692\n&gt;&gt; Okay, another one here.\n\n130\n00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:58.210\nQuestion 6, this one is dealing\nwith a new acquisition.\n\n131\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.130\nEvery time a new acquisition,\nwe're talking about business acquisitions.\n\n132\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.139\nEvery time a new acquisition is undertaken\nthe bank has difficulty integrating\n\n133\n00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.790\nthe people, processes and IT services\ninto the existing organization.\n\n134\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.320\nSome of the issues are listed below.\n\n135\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.590\nSo now there's just a list of five issues,\nsorry, yeah five issues.\n\n136\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.679\nGot my roman numerals right here.\n\n137\n00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:21.602\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There's five issues there, right.\n\n138\n00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:24.802\nI'm considering that context IT.\n\n139\n00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:28.879\nSome systems from the acquired companies\nhad been retired before it was clear\n\n140\n00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.522\nhow this work would be\nmanaged in legacy systems.\n\n141\n00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:34.690\nOkay, that's an IT issue, so\nthat's why I put it in green, right.\n\n142\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.323\nOn other occasions, two or\n\n143\n00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:41.229\neven three systems have been retained even\nthough they all perform the same work.\n\n144\n00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:46.375\nSo those are kinda adding up to\nthere's not a regime of evaluation for\n\n145\n00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.427\nthese system that come in.\n\n146\n00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:52.837\nDesigns that merge IT services have not\nfully taken operational realities and\n\n147\n00:07:52.837 --> 00:07:53.981\nin consideration.\n\n148\n00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:55.513\nSo we got bad design.\n\n149\n00:07:55.513 --> 00:07:58.004\nWe got bad evaluation in the transitions.\n\n150\n00:07:58.004 --> 00:07:58.756\nRight.\n\n151\n00:07:58.756 --> 00:08:01.651\nTransitions have been\nexecuted in a rushed manner,\n\n152\n00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:06.720\nfocusing primarily on functionality,\nmeaning the warranty could be lacking.\n\n153\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.830\nAs a result, training for support\nstaff and users has been neglected.\n\n154\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.060\nKnowledge transfer hasn't been effective.\n\n155\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.070\nWe got the functionality there, but\nwe haven't taken care of the user side and\n\n156\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.080\nthe support side of things.\n\n157\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.950\nAnd there is insufficient knowledge\ndocumentation for the services.\n\n158\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.840\nAll right,\nyou're seeing some of the issues here.\n\n159\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.010\nRequired technology and\nservice metrics are not being collected.\n\n160\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.454\nWe don't have measurements to enable\nthe services to be managed effectively.\n\n161\n00:08:34.454 --> 00:08:37.619\nOngoing, these things happen a lot,\nthey're saying, right?\n\n162\n00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:39.169\nThis is not a one off thing.\n\n163\n00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.505\nThat often,\nthese things are experienced, right?\n\n164\n00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:45.425\nSo you're the manager of the newly\nformed management office.\n\n165\n00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:49.570\n[LAUGH] You believe that many of the\nissues that have been experienced can be\n\n166\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.825\ntraced back to poor\nintegration between the stages.\n\n167\n00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:54.833\nI like that, right?\n\n168\n00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:58.490\nSymptomatically, it seems to be true.\n\n169\n00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.830\nAs a leader of the SMO, you're thinking,\n\n170\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.920\nif we have better integration among these\nprocesses, we might be in a better place.\n\n171\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.320\nSo then, what is the ask?\n\n172\n00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.530\nYou undertake a review to determine\nif each life cycle stage is\n\n173\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.340\nproviding the right outputs to\nbe inputs into other stages.\n\n174\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.970\nBased on your review, you identify\nthe highest priority items to be\n\n175\n00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.816\naddressed in a first set of improvements.\n\n176\n00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:26.912\nNow, this scenario is rich, right?\n\n177\n00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:28.180\nWe've got lots of data points.\n\n178\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.740\nWe've got five different data points that\npotentially points to interactions among\n\n179\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.888\nthe stages, right?\n\n180\n00:09:33.888 --> 00:09:39.207\nWe also have a case study over here that\ntalks about the challenges and priorities\n\n181\n00:09:39.207 --> 00:09:44.695\nand criticality of many of the activities\nthat the bank is undergoing, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:47.130\nSo don't forget that business context.\n\n183\n00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.660\nThere's no blue on this page, but there's\na lot of blue in that six page case study.\n\n184\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.690\nSo again, which one of the following\noptions represents the best set of outputs\n\n185\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.900\nand inputs to be addressed\nas high priority?\n\n186\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.250\nWhat to work on first\nis the question here.\n\n187\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.890\nAnd you're looking holistically\nacross all the life cycle stages and\n\n188\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.090\ntrying to discern the interfaces that\naddress these specific issues in\n\n189\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.640\na scenario as well as the business\ncriticality back in the case study.\n\n190\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.149\nAs we've done with the other ones,\nwe had lots of data points.\n\n191\n00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:23.562\nCan you find bad ones, right?\n\n192\n00:10:23.562 --> 00:10:28.267\nIn this case, there are many bad\nones that aren't related to this\n\n193\n00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:33.350\nspecific scenario or\neven related to the case study at all.\n\n194\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.990\nKnowledge for the SKMS.\n\n195\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.830\nIt says all.\n\n196\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.654\nHow can all be your priority?\n\n197\n00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:42.624\nBest not delineating anything, right?\n\n198\n00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:44.590\nThis is a matter of prioritization.\n\n199\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.460\nSure, you could have\nsome knowledge issues.\n\n200\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.170\nThey were highlighted in the scenario.\n\n201\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.563\nThey showed up in the case study.\n\n202\n00:10:49.563 --> 00:10:52.755\nThere are knowledge management issues, but\n\n203\n00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:55.783\nhow could all be where\nyou go as a priority?\n\n204\n00:10:55.783 --> 00:10:58.113\nYou can't boil the ocean, right?\n\n205\n00:10:58.113 --> 00:11:01.876\nYou're gonna have to work on\nsmaller bottles of water first.\n\n206\n00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:03.280\n&gt;&gt; Nope, you can't boil the ocean.\n\n207\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.235\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n208\n00:11:04.235 --> 00:11:05.336\n&gt;&gt; It's a little bit too big, I think.\n\n209\n00:11:05.336 --> 00:11:07.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Operational performance data.\n\n210\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:14.449\nThere are some suggestion that operational\nperformance data is an issue, right?\n\n211\n00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:16.969\nThere are some indication there, but\n\n212\n00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:21.260\nthe operational data from\nservice operations to CSI.\n\n213\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.290\nThere was no specific indication\nthat ongoing performance\n\n214\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.550\nwas not being able to be monitored.\n\n215\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.960\nThey were talking about he measurements\nof the processes between design and\n\n216\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.682\ntransition, primarily.\n\n217\n00:11:31.682 --> 00:11:36.060\nSo they got the wrong groups here going,\nright?\n\n218\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.100\nVision and\nmission from service strategy to all.\n\n219\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.300\nNo indication in this that\nthe vision wasn't clear.\n\n220\n00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.050\nAgain, it's not directly\nrelevant in this case, and also,\n\n221\n00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:54.520\na rather big all-all is\na vital business function.\n\n222\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.189\nAgain, in scope of the particular\nscenarios, we understand the criticality.\n\n223\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.690\nWe're not missing that.\n\n224\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.306\nWe're just not evaluating the services and\n\n225\n00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:07.775\nproviding appropriate hand\nover is what it boils down to.\n\n226\n00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:10.132\nAnd in the patterns of business activity,\nwe're also one.\n\n227\n00:12:10.132 --> 00:12:10.897\nI'm looking at the last one.\n\n228\n00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.160\nAgain, easier for me now to do this.\n\n229\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.846\nYou got to read a lot of these things.\n\n230\n00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:19.818\nBut if you can find some outliers that\nare just clearly not appropriate,\n\n231\n00:12:19.818 --> 00:12:23.991\nwrong, bad, then you can\neliminate some answers, right?\n\n232\n00:12:23.991 --> 00:12:28.528\nAnd I think what's interesting here, too,\nnot that this would have been easy for\n\n233\n00:12:28.528 --> 00:12:32.040\nyou to do and parse out, but\nknowledge for the SKMS is in B and C.\n\n234\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.850\nIt's a bad one, it's in B and C.\n\n235\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.744\nAnother one, operation performance\nstandard, also in B and C.\n\n236\n00:12:36.744 --> 00:12:40.471\nIt looks like we can\nmaybe get rid of B and C.\n\n237\n00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:45.990\nSo now, we have our opportunity\nto further investigate A and D.\n\n238\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.860\nAs we've seen in previous ones,\nlook at this one.\n\n239\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.080\nNeither one of them are perfect, right?\n\n240\n00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.420\nA, in fact, has a red one in it,\nD, in fact.\n\n241\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.950\nI'm sorry, yeah, that's right.\n\n242\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.522\nA and C is what we need to be going for,\nmy bad.\n\n243\n00:12:59.522 --> 00:13:04.496\nAll right, C is in play with all green,\nA is in play with some green,\n\n244\n00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:06.288\nbut it's also got one of the red ones.\n\n245\n00:13:06.288 --> 00:13:09.427\nSo if you're very clear,\nI mean, if you get so\n\n246\n00:13:09.427 --> 00:13:12.809\nlucky to think that vision and\nmission is wrong and\n\n247\n00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:17.253\neliminated, then you can also get\nrid of A as a 5 answer, right?\n\n248\n00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:18.959\nSo you can see a balance there.\n\n249\n00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:23.770\nAgain, the approach to taking\nit is process of elimination.\n\n250\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.690\nIf you can find some bad ones,\nget rid of them, right?\n\n251\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.170\nEliminate those right away.\n\n252\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.350\nIf it's not clear what's bad, obviously,\nit's not as easy to do, right?\n\n253\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.580\nSo find an egregious bad one and\n\n254\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.710\nsee which ones it points to and\nget rid of those first.\n\n255\n00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:44.292\nThen you come back and manage the nuance\nof the other ones, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:47.111\nA little bit of business\ncontext in this one.\n\n257\n00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:52.080\nThe bank has just started working on a new\nservice offering to be supported by a new\n\n258\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.574\nbusiness activity and a new IT service.\n\n259\n00:13:54.574 --> 00:13:56.440\nSo that's some business background.\n\n260\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.010\nThe business is going somewhere.\n\n261\n00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.860\nThey're gonna fund it,\nwe're gonna go this way.\n\n262\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.120\nAnd it's gonna include a new business\nactivity and a new IT service.\n\n263\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.340\nThe rest of it is rather green,\nas you can see.\n\n264\n00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.550\nThere's no specific ask here.\n\n265\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.699\nThe reason why that is,\n\n266\n00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:14.813\nis because what we're trying to\ndo is make a sourcing decision.\n\n267\n00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.160\nI'll tell you why in a second.\n\n268\n00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.790\nIn this way, it's talking about\nthe factors that are in play.\n\n269\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.800\nAnd I've just put some\nthings in bold face here.\n\n270\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.540\nThe new IT service represents\nan innovative approach in banking for\n\n271\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.020\nboth the bank and the market.\n\n272\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.390\nIt is considered state of the art\nwith respect to both approach and\n\n273\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.720\nuse of technology.\n\n274\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.240\nSo as I look at the question, I'm trying\nto find the best sourcing decision.\n\n275\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.990\nWhat's the best choice for sourcing?\n\n276\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.890\nNow, here's your choices for sourcing.\n\n277\n00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.990\nInternal, meaning embedded\nwith the business unit,\n\n278\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.830\nshared services within the organization,\nor outsourcing it.\n\n279\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.938\nThat's your three choices.\n\n280\n00:14:55.938 --> 00:15:01.370\nIn, centralized, out.\n\n281\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.467\nSo among those choices,\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n282\n00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:08.691\nNow, some of the key factors we've\nlearned in other courses about\n\n283\n00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:13.463\nsourcing decisions deal with\nif it's highly proprietary.\n\n284\n00:15:13.463 --> 00:15:18.898\nMeaning, it helps you get your job done\nin a unique way in the marketplace.\n\n285\n00:15:18.898 --> 00:15:21.440\nYou're probably gonna keep\nthat closer to your chest.\n\n286\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.300\nThat typically excludes\nexternal providers.\n\n287\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.530\nIf it's giving you the key competitive\nadvantage, you don't wanna\n\n288\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.390\nbe giving up your competitive advantage by\noutsourcing to someone that could give up\n\n289\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:38.550\nthose secrets or sell this capability to\nsome other competitor of yours, right?\n\n290\n00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.300\nAnd that's what this nuisance is.\n\n291\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.360\nYou are considering\nsomething state of the art.\n\n292\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.693\nThis is new.\n\n293\n00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.682\nIt's not commodity type things.\n\n294\n00:15:45.682 --> 00:15:49.319\nThere's probably not a specialist out\nthere in the external market that can do\n\n295\n00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:49.991\nthat for you.\n\n296\n00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:57.505\nSo that's eliminating type 3,\nthe external part.\n\n297\n00:15:57.505 --> 00:16:02.300\nState of the art with respect to\nboth approach and use of technology.\n\n298\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.960\nBy the way, it also says, it's new not\njust to the bank, it's new to the market.\n\n299\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.930\nSo this is something\nyou're doing innovatively.\n\n300\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:16.350\nAnd you're probably not going to find a\nthird party provider to just provide that,\n\n301\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.900\nas matter of scale and economy.\n\n302\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.280\nAnd you're also could be divulging\nsome proprietary secrets you\n\n303\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:21.829\ndon't wanna give up.\n\n304\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.140\nTime to market low price and security.\n\n305\n00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.950\nYou want to be fast,\njust negotiating with external providers,\n\n306\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.600\ngetting your requirements\nvetted could take a long time.\n\n307\n00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.628\nSo, fast is probably not what you're\ngoing to get with external ones.\n\n308\n00:16:34.628 --> 00:16:36.694\nLow price?\n\n309\n00:16:36.694 --> 00:16:40.825\nMaybe you could find\na lower price outside,\n\n310\n00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:43.375\nespecially if it's something that's\nalready in their wheelhouse.\n\n311\n00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:46.810\nBut since this is a new innovative thing,\nit's probably not in their wheelhouse so\n\n312\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.625\nyou're probably not going to drive prices.\n\n313\n00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:53.450\nAnd then security, outsourcing\nis less secure than insourcing.\n\n314\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.300\nIt's not that external\nproviders can't be secure,\n\n315\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.280\nit's just obviously a lot\nmore secure in-house.\n\n316\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.906\nSo there's a little bit of\npredisposition in the second bullet to\n\n317\n00:17:03.906 --> 00:17:07.280\nexclude an external provider as well.\n\n318\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.220\nSo since you're trying to choose between\none, two, and three, the approach to\n\n319\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.730\nthis one is try to find those factors\nthat would exclude these things.\n\n320\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.350\nAnd I've already got a couple ones\nexcluding external, so now I've just gotta\n\n321\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.590\nbe thinking internal or shared is\nreally what I'm trying to do here.\n\n322\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.020\nNotice C is not even the sourcing at all.\n\n323\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.050\nC is just saying establish a new\nIT group and they take care of it.\n\n324\n00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.100\n&gt;&gt; It's like a throw away.\n\n325\n00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.530\n&gt;&gt; It really is kinda a throw away.\n\n326\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.330\nit says outsource IT\nresponsibilities to a third party.\n\n327\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.130\nOutsource IT responsibilities and\nbusiness activity.\n\n328\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.410\nReally giving it up.\n\n329\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.240\nYou're gaining a competitive advantage and\n\n330\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.900\nyou wanna give this\ncompetitive advantage away?\n\n331\n00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.900\nProbably not, so B is a nonstarter.\n\n332\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.840\nSo then we're talking about D,\nwhich ends up being a good one.\n\n333\n00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.460\nSo you're really discerning between\nthe various options you have.\n\n334\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.020\nAnd related to the business criticality,\n\n335\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.640\nthe business advantages\nyou're trying to gain,\n\n336\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.700\nkeeping this as a shared service ends up\nbeing at the top of the list effectively.\n\n337\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.200\n&gt;&gt; Number five.\n\n338\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n339\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.448\nSo then question eight.\n\n340\n00:18:17.448 --> 00:18:20.020\nNo blue bits here,\nthat's all in the case study.\n\n341\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.020\nAnd no red bits here unnecessarily\nbecause it's just talking about\n\n342\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.150\nthe background in this case regarding\n\n343\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.840\nconcerns of IT service supporting the\nbusiness critical customer call centers.\n\n344\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.912\nSo the business has a call center,\n\n345\n00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:35.085\nIT support of that call\ncenter is what is in play.\n\n346\n00:18:35.085 --> 00:18:38.830\nIt needs to be more scalable, and\n\n347\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.790\nbetter reporting for\nthe IT service that supports that.\n\n348\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:47.060\nSo the IT service is not scaling\nwell with the business process.\n\n349\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.050\nAnd there needs to be better reporting,\npointing those things out.\n\n350\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.380\nAs we move through and asking the specific\nquestion, at this point in the project,\n\n351\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.450\nwhich one of the following answers\nis the best list of outputs that\n\n352\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.000\nthe IT operations manager should provide\nto ensure success of the revised service?\n\n353\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.840\nOutputs, so, what type of reporting are\nyou going to put out in front of people\n\n354\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.550\nthat allows them to understand\nhow to move forward?\n\n355\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.530\nAnd again, we talk about\nmanaging across the lifecycle,\n\n356\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.730\nthe importance of measurement.\n\n357\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:21.580\nThe importance of data and information\nis critical to the ongoing planning.\n\n358\n00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.050\nIn the absence of data,\nyou have whining right?\n\n359\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:25.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n360\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they have whining.\n\n361\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.380\n&gt;&gt; If it's not data, it's just whining.\n\n362\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.190\n&gt;&gt; Or a rumor, or just conjecture.\n\n363\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.410\nWhat you're trying to drill down into.\n\n364\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.900\nSo what are the best point of outputs that\npoint to the specific challenges here.\n\n365\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.460\nAnd hopefully there again,\nthere's some bright red ones.\n\n366\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.550\nD happens to show up as\nbeing bright red here,\n\n367\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.209\nlet's see why it might be bright red.\n\n368\n00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.820\nFeedback on operational risk to\nthe change evaluation process.\n\n369\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:55.480\nNot related to this particular issue at\nall was a change evaluation, not at all.\n\n370\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.560\nSo they're just going\nin the wrong direction.\n\n371\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.740\nThis data's not going to help us a bit.\n\n372\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.810\nAs you compare it to A,\nhistorical information on incidents and\n\n373\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.550\nproblems for capacity and availability.\n\n374\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.840\nBecause that's what the scale part is.\n\n375\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.660\nScaling is about capacity management and\navailability management.\n\n376\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.860\nWell let's get some data about that,\nso we can start chewing on that fat.\n\n377\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.230\nAgain, we're just talking about what data\nwe need to do to make a wise decision.\n\n378\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.520\nNot even making that decision yet.\n\n379\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.780\nOther ones, feedback on issues\nconcerning validation and testing.\n\n380\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.330\nOur testing was bad.\n\n381\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.090\nService metric and\nkey performance indicators, achievement.\n\n382\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:42.680\nHow are we doing compared to our targeted,\nagreed targets, etc?\n\n383\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.140\nB is fairly compelling.\n\n384\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.890\nIt's got two, or it's got three good\nones but one kind of neutral one.\n\n385\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.230\nIt talks about information in\nthe service knowledge management system\n\n386\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.480\nto the CSI stage.\n\n387\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.764\nHow is knowledge management feeding\nCSI with something they wanted to grab\n\n388\n00:20:58.764 --> 00:21:00.100\ninformation on?\n\n389\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.040\nIt's not a bad thing.\n\n390\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.710\nIt's just not related to this particular\nscenario, these particular issues and\n\n391\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.820\nthis particular business case.\n\n392\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.170\n&gt;&gt; So once again, extraneous and\nyou don't need extraneous.\n\n393\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.620\nYou just need factoids, you need data.\n\n394\n00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.950\n&gt;&gt; That's right and data that's\nspecific related, not extraneous.\n\n395\n00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.760\nAbsolutely, good call.\n\n396\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:23.390\nSo again the nuances here is, you read\nthe rationale that's available to you.\n\n397\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.450\nHopefully it's clear, the differences\nbetween the meh, and the good.\n\n398\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.090\nAnd you can focus on the good ones.\n\n399\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.510\nAnd again, eliminating the bad\nones is also important.\n\n400\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:39.670\nSo you're always operating within\nthat five and three wheelhouse there.\n\n401\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.090\nSo now,\nplease understand what just happened.\n\n402\n00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.910\nHere's a move to question nine.\n\n403\n00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.010\nEight of the questions were\nassociated with a case study.\n\n404\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.670\nQuestions nine and ten are not.\n\n405\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.280\nSo put down your case study hat.\n\n406\n00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.950\nDon't worry about that\ncontext at all any more.\n\n407\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.250\nQuestion nine and question ten\nare based on a specific scenario.\n\n408\n00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.280\nThis is more in keeping with\nthe old intermediate exams,\n\n409\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.960\nif you will, where there is no case study,\nthere's just a scenario and a question.\n\n410\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.939\n&gt;&gt; Question for you then Terry, why does\nit say please refer to the case study?\n\n411\n00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:14.894\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, my bad, my bad.\n\n412\n00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:17.220\nThank you Zach, good catch.\n\n413\n00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.170\nAs many as 2 questions could go there.\n\n414\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.280\nI was premature.\n\n415\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.250\nI am so sorry.\n\n416\n00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:21.970\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n417\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.440\nThat's why we're doing this together,\nright?\n\n418\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n419\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.130\n&gt;&gt; You bet.\n&gt;&gt; I fast forward to question ten.\n\n420\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.230\nThis question does not use the case study.\n\n421\n00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.062\n&gt;&gt; Ten is a good question.\n\n422\n00:22:32.062 --> 00:22:36.520\n&gt;&gt; As many as two questions may\nnot rely on the case study.\n\n423\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.665\nIn this case, nine out of ten\ndid rely on the case study.\n\n424\n00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:42.520\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Only one didn't.\n\n425\n00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:48.830\nYou could face an exam where eight of the\nten are on the case study and two are not.\n\n426\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.610\nSo, and it will clearly say,\nthis question does not use the case study.\n\n427\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:54.441\n&gt;&gt; Bang.\n&gt;&gt; So remember,\n\n428\n00:22:54.441 --> 00:22:56.369\ndon't use the case study for\nyour rationale [CROSSTALK].\n\n429\n00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:59.630\n&gt;&gt; As I said before, Bingo Long and\nthe Traveling All Stars.\n\n430\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:00.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you much, that's right.\n\n431\n00:23:00.825 --> 00:23:05.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Another aspect to this is that\n\n432\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:12.610\nif the previous question, question\neight is relying on the case study and\n\n433\n00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:17.090\nit has a good long scenario and\nthat scenario introduces new facts.\n\n434\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.570\nYou got to scratch those\nfacts from the next one.\n\n435\n00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.360\nIn other words,\n\n436\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.320\nthe case study has facts that\nare universally applied to all questions.\n\n437\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.210\nA question may have a scenario that\nintroduces new facts but those facts\n\n438\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:38.330\nare only related to that question, they\nwouldn't go on over to the next question.\n\n439\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:43.010\nSo keep that in mind as well.\n\n440\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.990\nThank you so much Zach for assist.\n\n441\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.390\n&gt;&gt; No problem, my dear Sherlock.\n\n442\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you much.\n\n443\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.410\nThat's why we have sidekicks,\nthat's exactly right.\n\n444\n00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.862\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n445\n00:23:50.862 --> 00:23:54.054\n&gt;&gt; In this particular case,\nthis particular one, question nine,\n\n446\n00:23:54.054 --> 00:23:56.267\nplease refer to the case study, obviously.\n\n447\n00:23:56.267 --> 00:24:00.752\nWe're looking in this case at some\nYou decide what set of set of\n\n448\n00:24:00.752 --> 00:24:04.808\nservice metrics to use for\nthe sales support service and\n\n449\n00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:10.270\nat which service life cycle stage\nthe metrics can be measured.\n\n450\n00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.980\nYou brainstorm the following\nservice measures.\n\n451\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.360\nOkay, so those are the difference,\nor the new ones are here.\n\n452\n00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.670\nYou need to decide what set of service\nmetrics to use for the sales support\n\n453\n00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:25.470\nservice, and at which service life cycle\nstage those metrics can be measured.\n\n454\n00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.230\nYou brainstorm the following\nservice metrics.\n\n455\n00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.430\nSo, effectively, what you're doing here,\nyou got a list of 12 different things.\n\n456\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.950\nIf you look at the question, it says\nwhich one is the right balance of things?\n\n457\n00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.150\nAll right, so\neffectively what you're doing\n\n458\n00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:43.140\nis analyzing each one of these metrics for\ntheir appropriateness, right?\n\n459\n00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.302\nIn this case are there ones\nthat are clearly wrong?\n\n460\n00:24:45.302 --> 00:24:46.880\nJust as we've done before.\n\n461\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.520\nIf you can find some clearly wrong ones,\nthen you can go and\n\n462\n00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.850\neliminate some answers, are there\nany that are clearly wrong, right?\n\n463\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.900\nOf course,\nI've already done the color coding, so\n\n464\n00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.890\nyou'll see that there are some\nthat are wrong, right?\n\n465\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.390\nAnd just so happens that only\nquestion D has wrong ones in it.\n\n466\n00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.890\nRight?\n\n467\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.345\nKind of small detail there.\n\n468\n00:25:07.345 --> 00:25:07.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n469\n00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.190\n&gt;&gt; But\nI can at least get rid of question D.\n\n470\n00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.550\nNow, why are they wrong?\n\n471\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.839\nPredicted batch turnaround time\nduring the agreed service hours.\n\n472\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.185\nVariation from predicted batch turnaround\ntime during the agreed service hours.\n\n473\n00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:24.385\nWhat the heck does batch turnaround have\nto do with this scenario, what does it\n\n474\n00:25:24.385 --> 00:25:27.695\nhave to do with the case study, what does\nit have to do with these issues, right?\n\n475\n00:25:27.695 --> 00:25:32.115\nSo again,\ngetting rid of those as an element, right?\n\n476\n00:25:32.115 --> 00:25:36.126\nThen, so now, you're looking at,\nif you get rid of the reds,\n\n477\n00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:41.070\nthen the black ones are really just\nkind of business-related metrics.\n\n478\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.784\nThey're not service lifecycle metrics.\n\n479\n00:25:44.784 --> 00:25:46.982\nAnd remember, the ask was,\n\n480\n00:25:46.982 --> 00:25:50.250\nat which service life cycle stage\nwould these be captured in?\n\n481\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.710\nAnd you can't consider\nservice life cycle stage\n\n482\n00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.560\nas those places where you\ncapture business metrics.\n\n483\n00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.270\nIt's not that you don't want\nto capture business metrics.\n\n484\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.320\nIt's just that those business metrics\naren't captured within these stages.\n\n485\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.890\n&gt;&gt; It is what it is, right.\n\n486\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.140\n&gt;&gt; So,\nplaying those out against themselves.\n\n487\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.999\nSo again, process elimination and\ndetection, Doctor Watson,\n\n488\n00:26:11.999 --> 00:26:13.622\nas you move through these.\n\n489\n00:26:13.622 --> 00:26:18.504\nAnd it's elementary, hopefully,\nthat you can find the red ones easily and\n\n490\n00:26:18.504 --> 00:26:22.150\neliminate those and\ndiscern the meh from the good ones.\n\n491\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.090\n&gt;&gt; Eliminate the erroneous and\nthe extraneous.\n\n492\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you look, again,\nthe difference between B and C is so\n\n493\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.024\nutterly subtle, right?\n\n494\n00:26:29.024 --> 00:26:32.720\nThe difference between B and\nC with all those data points,\n\n495\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.070\nis that B happens to include answer 10 or\nmetric 10,\n\n496\n00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.170\nwhich is decrease in the total cost\nof handling IT service incidents.\n\n497\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:46.120\nWhich, again, is not related to this\nparticular sales support service issue.\n\n498\n00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.190\nWe're not talking about cost measures,\n\n499\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.060\nwe're talking about response times and\neffectiveness.\n\n500\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.510\nWe're not talking about cost.\n\n501\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.870\nSo, decrease in the total cost.\n\n502\n00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.800\nSure, it's important to decrease cost.\n\n503\n00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.430\nIt probably always is\nimportant to consider cost.\n\n504\n00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.990\nRight?\n\n505\n00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.200\nBut that's not the issue\nbeing played out here.\n\n506\n00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.650\nThey're willing to spend the money,\nget it right, get it good.\n\n507\n00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.930\nWe're willing to spend the money for\nit, so\n\n508\n00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.330\ncost is not an issue to\nconcern ourselves with.\n\n509\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.540\nAnd that's the only real meh one or\n\n510\n00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.420\nbad one in this scheme of things,\nis that cost is not a factor here.\n\n511\n00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.543\nSo the challenge at the MALC,\nI can't reinforce this enough either,\n\n512\n00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:26.810\nthe challenge at the MALC is,\n\n513\n00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.260\nyou necessarily have to be\nat the 5,000 foot level.\n\n514\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.560\nYou're looking at the big picture.\n\n515\n00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.810\nBut to effectively manage the big picture,\nyou got to get to that level of detail.\n\n516\n00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.420\nYou gotta dive in to the details.\n\n517\n00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.640\nThat's not an easy task.\n\n518\n00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.500\nIt's very hard for me to be macro and\nmicro in the same minute, right?\n\n519\n00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.750\nI tend to think up here,\nright, and stay up here.\n\n520\n00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.190\nOr I tend to get down in the details,\nand stay down here, right?\n\n521\n00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.060\nWhen you're on a MALC exam,\nyou gotta go up and down a lot.\n\n522\n00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.410\nSo get used to managing that\ndynamic in your own brain.\n\n523\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.337\nWhen are you at the macro level and\nwhen you're at the micro level?\n\n524\n00:28:00.337 --> 00:28:05.200\nAnd as you parse through these questions,\ndon't forget the micro.\n\n525\n00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.470\nYou can't just scan it.\n\n526\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.740\nYou're gonna have to\nget into those details.\n\n527\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.970\nNow, question 10 does not base\nitself on a case study at all.\n\n528\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.290\nSo, it's a full-blown scenario,\n\n529\n00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:21.020\njust as we might have seen on\nthe other intermediate-level exams.\n\n530\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.700\nAnd to repeat what I said earlier, when\nyou take the MALC exam, as many as two\n\n531\n00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.660\nquestions could be in this category of\nnot being related to the case study.\n\n532\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.840\n&gt;&gt; So pay attention.\n\n533\n00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.560\n&gt;&gt; It is in pretty big letters,\nthis question does not use the case study.\n\n534\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.770\nFortunately, this scenario is\nnot talking about a bank either,\n\n535\n00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.790\nit is also talking about a university.\n\n536\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.590\nAn IT organization providing\nIT services to universities.\n\n537\n00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.740\nRight.\nSo, hopefully it will also be obvious in\n\n538\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.910\nthe distinction from the business case,\nfrom the case study, I should say.\n\n539\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.120\nSo as we've done before, there's\nthe blue bits, the business context,\n\n540\n00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.220\nthe green bits,\nthe IT service provider's context.\n\n541\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.520\nAnd the red bits, the specific\ndeficiencies that have been highlighted\n\n542\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.840\nand the actions that are being requested.\n\n543\n00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.600\n&gt;&gt; The ask.\n\n544\n00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.120\n&gt;&gt; The ask.\n\n545\n00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.970\nNow, as we look at this one,\nfortunately, I think, for\n\n546\n00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.580\nthis one, it was pretty darn clear.\n\n547\n00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.260\nThere is a clear green one.\n\n548\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.100\nComparing C to D, you might think D.\n\n549\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.860\nAnd D is just so theoretical.\n\n550\n00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.240\nIt's like a perfect Ital Island answer,\n\n551\n00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.220\nthat has nothing to do with\nthe reality of the scenario.\n\n552\n00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.702\nJust look at the first sentence.\n\n553\n00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:35.685\nUnderstand the high-level vision from\nan IT perspective and define the strategy.\n\n554\n00:29:35.685 --> 00:29:41.083\nIT perspective, very subtle.\n\n555\n00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:42.260\nRight?\n\n556\n00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.990\nBut why would you want to comprehend\nthe challenges from an IT perspective?\n\n557\n00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.290\nSee how it's broken.\n\n558\n00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.920\nNow you have to consider IT when you're\nconsidering IT service management,\n\n559\n00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.820\nI'm not saying you don't.\n\n560\n00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.820\nYou have to consider yourself.\n\n561\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.655\nThe cobbler's kids need shoes too.\n\n562\n00:29:57.655 --> 00:29:59.680\n[LAUGH] I totally get that, right.\n\n563\n00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.406\nBut the first sentence in B makes the rest\nof it suspect because it focuses on\n\n564\n00:30:05.406 --> 00:30:10.000\nthe IT perspective, and what do you\nknow about the golden concepts?\n\n565\n00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.930\nCustomer, value, and service.\n\n566\n00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.430\nSo it's got to be focused on the business.\n\n567\n00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Not the IT.\n\n568\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.810\nEverything else in D is correct.\n\n569\n00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.903\nSo, what, two words,\nIT perspective, make D wrong.\n\n570\n00:30:25.903 --> 00:30:26.832\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n571\n00:30:26.832 --> 00:30:27.940\n&gt;&gt; Basically,\ncuz it's got the wrong thing.\n\n572\n00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.183\nThe rest of them aren't incorrect.\n\n573\n00:30:29.183 --> 00:30:34.630\nThey're even appropriate perhaps,\nas you focus on IT.\n\n574\n00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.870\nBut, you can't just focus on IT.\n\n575\n00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.360\nSo, do a compare and\ncontrast right away to D, for instance.\n\n576\n00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.820\nConduct the assessment of\nthe current situation.\n\n577\n00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.330\nBaselining, right?\n\n578\n00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.360\nBy first understanding the vision.\n\n579\n00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.850\nThis is basic CSI approach, and\n\n580\n00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:53.560\nthe vision is related to\nthe revision of the business.\n\n581\n00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.180\nIt says, by understanding the vision,\n\n582\n00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:00.240\nby discussing this with senior IT and\nbusiness management.\n\n583\n00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.020\nSo, C is already distinguished from D in\nthat there's a business focus, alright?\n\n584\n00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.955\nThey both start with vision,\nwhich is appropriate,\n\n585\n00:31:07.955 --> 00:31:09.920\nbut what's the vision focused on?\n\n586\n00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.660\nPretty clear.\n\n587\n00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.120\nLet's see where,\nwell that's what's wrong with d.\n\n588\n00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.060\nLet's take a look at b and\na right quick, and\n\n589\n00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.160\nencourage better\ncommunication looking at b.\n\n590\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.920\nEncourage better communications\nwith customers is a top priority.\n\n591\n00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.110\nYou've jumped to a solution stage.\n\n592\n00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.830\nYou haven't stopped and\nlooked at the vision stage.\n\n593\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.450\nYou haven't adopted a measurement\nobjective approach right?\n\n594\n00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.730\nYou're jumping to solutions.\n\n595\n00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.254\nRight?\nA is getting perhaps a little closer to\n\n596\n00:31:39.254 --> 00:31:40.852\nfinding out some things.\n\n597\n00:31:40.852 --> 00:31:44.630\nConduct a strategic assessment looking at\nthe internal and external environment,\n\n598\n00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.350\nhold meetings with IT senior\nmanagement team to fully discuss, and\n\n599\n00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.890\nunderstand the position\nregarding finances.\n\n600\n00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.660\nNot too bad but,\nno business focus anywhere in there.\n\n601\n00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.920\nIn A, no business focus at all.\n\n602\n00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.240\nSo again, the golden concepts, customer,\nvalue, service are expressed in C.\n\n603\n00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:08.240\nThe key concepts of following a methodical\napproach of focusing on the vision,\n\n604\n00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.360\nthen establishing your baseline,\nunderstanding where you are before moving\n\n605\n00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.025\nforward to plans,\nthat's embodied in C as well.\n\n606\n00:32:15.085 --> 00:32:19.165\nThat kind of approach,\ncustomer focus, value focused,\n\n607\n00:32:19.165 --> 00:32:22.925\nservice focused, with a methodical\napproach to look before you leap,\n\n608\n00:32:22.925 --> 00:32:25.425\nwill serve you on any given question.\n\n609\n00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:28.325\nCouple that with the ability\nto do the macro view and\n\n610\n00:32:28.325 --> 00:32:32.088\nthe micro view,\nit's gonna be a big help for you on these.\n\n611\n00:32:32.088 --> 00:32:33.774\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff.\n\n612\n00:32:33.774 --> 00:32:38.240\n&gt;&gt; So when you're ready, you got two\nsample papers out there to practise on.\n\n613\n00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.900\nYou have the case study to memorize.\n\n614\n00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.270\nAnd I suggest that you do a SWAT\nanalysis of that case study and\n\n615\n00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.900\na maturity assessment\nthrough that case study.\n\n616\n00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.110\nSo you kind of know the lay of\nthe land of that case study.\n\n617\n00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:54.590\nMemorizing is probably a bit harsh,\nmaybe a little overkill on the case study.\n\n618\n00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.710\nBut you should know it backwards and\nforwards, and be able to pretty much\n\n619\n00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.950\nbible and verse, repeat its strengths and\nweaknesses as you go through.\n\n620\n00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:06.930\nSo if you haven't taken the other sample\npaper, sample paper two, go take that one.\n\n621\n00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.020\nReach out in the forum for discussion.\n\n622\n00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.530\nCertainly, you'll find experts\nthere to respond to your questions,\n\n623\n00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.770\nother peers that have\nperhaps taken this exam and\n\n624\n00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.000\ngiven you a feedback on it,\nmay be available there.\n\n625\n00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.670\nCertainly review the answers and\nthe rationale.\n\n626\n00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.000\nAnd don't do it just to\nget the right answer.\n\n627\n00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.840\nDo it for the new learning aspects.\n\n628\n00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.070\nYou can learn from these exams,\nyou absolutely can.\n\n629\n00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:30.470\nAnd not only can you learn\nthe subject matter, you can learn\n\n630\n00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:35.020\nabout the mind of the test maker, their\napproach and their objectives, right?\n\n631\n00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.600\nWhen you're ready to take that exam,\nyou can go to PassionITGroup,\n\n632\n00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.120\norder a voucher there and\none you have the voucher in your hands,\n\n633\n00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.040\nyou can schedule that\nat a convenient time.\n\n634\n00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.520\nI wish you luck in your studies.\n\n635\n00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.200\nI look forward to seeing you in the forum.\n\n636\n00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.600\n&gt;&gt; Terry, once again, thank you for your\nguidance and thank you for yout wisdom.\n\n637\n00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.890\nITIL MALC sample paper review.\n\n638\n00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.960\nThis has been part two,\nwatch part one, too.\n\n639\n00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.620\nIt's important.\n\n640\n00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.590\nAnd there is a lot of content\nin the ITIL MALC library.\n\n641\n00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.010\nA lot of video to watch.\n\n642\n00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.970\nWatch them all, you'll be glad you did.\n\n643\n00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.660\nAnd thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n644\n00:34:06.660 -->
