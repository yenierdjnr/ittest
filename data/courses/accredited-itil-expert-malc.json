00:00:07.926\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:09.940\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.440\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.450\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.110\nVery excited to be your host for\nITIL, managing across the life cycle.\n\n9\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.738\nAnd we'll be diving into logistics,\n\n10\n00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:30.606\nsetup and expectations with\nour very own Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:31.524\nAnd he's right there.\n\n12\n00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yup happy to be here Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.689\nAs usual we're going to setup\nthis course by talking about\n\n14\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.990\nthe basic logistics of things.\n\n15\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.190\nWork to orient yourself\ntowards the class files,\n\n16\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.800\nwhat you expect from the exam,\nwhat do you expect out of the course?\n\n17\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.510\nAnd without further adieu,\nlet's just kind of dive in here.\n\n18\n00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.910\nThis is the Capstone course for\nall of the ITIL curriculum.\n\n19\n00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.490\nIt's the final stage, if you will, before\nyou get to the ITIL expert credential.\n\n20\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.934\nSo, the prerequisite before you can\ntake this exam and get credit for\n\n21\n00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.012\nthe exam are 17 credit hours.\n\n22\n00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:07.470\nWe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n23\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.560\nAnd you see,\nwe're moving up the Blooms taxonomy scale.\n\n24\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.520\nYou have to apply your knowledge a little\nbit more expertly as the phrase goes.\n\n25\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.060\nSo, when we did foundations,\nwe were at the lower end of this.\n\n26\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080\nWe need to remember things and\nbe able to understand some concepts.\n\n27\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.932\nThe intermediate level exams that you've\ntaken dealt with applying knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:34.350\nAnd making sure that you could analyze\na given situation based on a scenario.\n\n29\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.500\nWell, what we're doing here in the MALC\nexam is taking it a little bit higher and\n\n30\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.140\nlooking at synthesizing, if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.350\nEvaluating a situation and\ncreating new knowledge, if you will,\n\n32\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.850\napplying it effectively.\n\n33\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.139\nAnd primarily that's done\nthrough this case study.\n\n34\n00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.299\nNot just scenarios but\n\n35\n00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.220\na full blown case study where you get\nvery familiar with this organization.\n\n36\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.009\nIt's a financial services organization.\n\n37\n00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.910\nIt's a challenging exam but it's also\na rewarding exam in that once passed,\n\n38\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.760\nyou get a very special\ncredential called ITIL expert.\n\n39\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.170\n&gt;&gt; And everybody wants to be\nan ITIL expert I would think.\n\n40\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n41\n00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Who wants to get in ITIL of course.\n\n42\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah..\n\n43\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.003\n&gt;&gt; So as we've done with the intermediate\nlevel exams and courses.\n\n44\n00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.482\nThere certainly are gonna be\nmy presentation of theory and\n\n45\n00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:24.810\nlecture approach giving real\nworld examples to these concepts.\n\n46\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.690\nThe primary difference is\nwe approach marker however\n\n47\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.750\nis that we are not really\nbringing in new information.\n\n48\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.220\nIt's really just going to be how\nwe can synthesize this information\n\n49\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.350\ntowards some common goal.\n\n50\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.912\nSo a little bit less\nimportance is my lecture.\n\n51\n00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:43.910\nIt's gonna be a high expectation\nthat you're gonna be diving\n\n52\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.170\ninto the practice exams,\nthe mock tests if you will.\n\n53\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.070\nYou're gonna be doing some exercises\nin getting real familiar with this\n\n54\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.250\ncase study.\n\n55\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.970\nThe good news is, is this case study that\nwe use throughout this portion of the exam\n\n56\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.440\nprep, is the exact same case study\nyou'll get on the real exam.\n\n57\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.982\nSo, you can memorize this thing.\n\n58\n00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:08.550\nYou'll know this company inside out\nbefore you even go o take the exam.\n\n59\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.030\nAnd then of course, the scenarios based on\nthis case study, this company if you will,\n\n60\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.210\nthat tease out some more details that you\nhave to approach in the actual questions.\n\n61\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of good information for\n\n62\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.130\nyou to sink your teeth\ninto in this course.\n\n63\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.483\nAll this material is owned and\noperated by AXELOS,\n\n64\n00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:33.011\nthe ones that own the copyright material,\nit's called ITIL curriculum.\n\n65\n00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:37.424\nA brief history, as you know ITIL\nhas been around since the late 80's.\n\n66\n00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:40.326\nIt's gone through some\nupgrades over the years.\n\n67\n00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:42.861\nWe're at now at version three since 2011.\n\n68\n00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:48.110\nThe only significant update to\nthe ITIL material since 2011 has been\n\n69\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.371\nthe addition of the ITIL practitioner\ncourse that came out last spring.\n\n70\n00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:57.392\nAnd that course helps answer the question,\n\n71\n00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:03.380\nhow would I go about answering\nthe question about adopting ITIL.\n\n72\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.400\nYou remember the five\nstages of the life cycle?\n\n73\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400\nAgain, no new information here.\n\n74\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.170\nI'm going to be, certainly,\n\n75\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.140\ntouching on the life cycle stages, and\nhow they integrate with each other.\n\n76\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.470\nThose inner points of integration,\nmanaging across the life cycle\n\n77\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.520\nnecessarily means you're gonna be\nlooking at this at a 5,000-foot view.\n\n78\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.380\nHolistically, looking at an organizational\nchallenges from a strategic point of view.\n\n79\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.160\nSo it's not just service strategy.\n\n80\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.850\nIt's looking at IT service management\n\n81\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.000\nthrough the lens of Strategic\napplication and strategic analysis.\n\n82\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.960\nSo again, kinda challenging, but\n\n83\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.390\nalso quite rewarding cuz it gives\nyou that nice big view of ITIL.\n\n84\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.240\nSo, The Qualification Scheme.\n\n85\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.490\nAll these is all maintained\nin accredited status\n\n86\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.490\nfrom AXELOS on through\nthe exam institutes.\n\n87\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.555\nExam institutes then accredit\ntraining organization,\n\n88\n00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:08.295\nI'm here representing PassionIT Group,\nan accredited training organization.\n\n89\n00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:11.115\nThey go through the rigors\nof designing the curriculum\n\n90\n00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:14.895\naccording to the syllabus as\npublished by the exam institutes.\n\n91\n00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:19.175\nThey are audited for compliance with\nthat syllabus and also audited for\n\n92\n00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.505\ncompliance in delivery.\n\n93\n00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:25.350\nSo that gives the PassionIT\ngroup the accreditation\n\n94\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.665\nto send me as an accredited trainer\nto deliver this for ITProTV.\n\n95\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.140\nObviously, all this is works together\nto mean that there's quality control\n\n96\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.510\nthroughout the system through the exams,\n\n97\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.679\nthrough the curriculum development,\nmapping back to a specific syllabus.\n\n98\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n99\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n100\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.675\nNow, it kinda looks like a house here,\nthe house that ITIL built.\n\n101\n00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:52.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you have a look near the bottom of\n\n102\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.110\nthis, you've got Foundation, of course.\n\n103\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.300\nThat's where you would expect\nto see the foundation.\n\n104\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.500\nIt's the bottom of the house.\n\n105\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.620\nThat is a prerequisite.\n\n106\n00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.170\nYou must have foundation.\n\n107\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.840\nAs one of your sets of credits.\n\n108\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.940\nYou get two credits for that.\n\n109\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.890\nYou'll see ITIL Practitioner\ncan get you three credits.\n\n110\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.950\nAs you go up through these courses,\nyou get different degrees of credits.\n\n111\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.720\nSo on the Capability Module side here,\nyou'll see Service Offerings and\n\n112\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.300\nAgreements, Release, Control and\nValidation, Planning, Protection and\n\n113\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.910\nOptimization, Operational Support and\nAnalysis.\n\n114\n00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.790\nThose Capability Modules\ngive you four credits each.\n\n115\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.850\nAll available on ITProTV, by the way.\n\n116\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we have the sample\npaper reviews as well that we did.\n\n117\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n118\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.620\nSo again,\nit's expectation before you take mount\n\n119\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.850\nyou've collected 17 credits.\n\n120\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.450\nHowever you get those credits two\nof them must be foundation, and\n\n121\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.190\nthen you just gotta go get 15 more.\n\n122\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.010\nDo you take these four capability ones,\nwhich is 16 a little overkill?\n\n123\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.470\nDo you take five life cycle ones,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.480\n&gt;&gt; To get those?\n\n125\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.980\nWhen you have a total of 17,\nYou are eligible to take the MALC exam.\n\n126\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.520\nAnd with the MALC exam,\nsuccessful passing the MALC exam,\n\n127\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.430\ngives you five credits, that totals 22.\n\n128\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.240\nThose 22 credits get you that magic\ncredential called ITIL expert.\n\n129\n00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.320\nTo be an accredited trainer you\nmust hold the expert credential.\n\n130\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.430\nSo, if you're in an accredited training\nclass you know that your instructor has\n\n131\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.760\ngone through the accredited\ntraining up to the expert level.\n\n132\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.710\nNow, in my particular case I've\nhappened to take both sides of these.\n\n133\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.470\nI've taken all the lifecycle ones.\n\n134\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.780\nI've taken all the capability ones.\n\n135\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.680\nI've also had practitioner and foundation.\n\n136\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.310\nAnd I bring that knowledge\nto the lecture for MALC.\n\n137\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.580\nYou need to do that too.\n\n138\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.280\nYou've gone on some path, to get here.\n\n139\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.350\nMaybe you've taken life cycle modules.\n\n140\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.070\nMaybe you've taken some\ncapability modules.\n\n141\n00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.240\nMaybe you've mixed and matched them,\nwhich is totally fine.\n\n142\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.950\nBut you're gonna be bringing\nthat knowledge to this course.\n\n143\n00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.244\nAnd more importantly,\n\n144\n00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:00.620\nholistically bringing that same\nknowledge to the MALC exam.\n\n145\n00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.482\nAs I mentioned before MALC\nbrings no new information.\n\n146\n00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:09.260\nIt's gonna be the trick of the trade\nhere is going to be how we use this\n\n147\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.730\ninformation in some sort of synthesis,\ncreating knowledge,\n\n148\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.280\ncreating application for this knowledge.\n\n149\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.519\nSo just a little bit step further.\n\n150\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.530\nHere they are again played out.\n\n151\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.920\nThe ITIL foundations through\nthe life cycle modules.\n\n152\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.140\nOne of the differences between the life\ncycle modules and the capability modules\n\n153\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.390\nis the life cycle modules are one to one\nrelationship to the core publications.\n\n154\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.300\nWhat I mean by that is there's\na course called service strategy.\n\n155\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.860\nThere's a core publication\ncalled service strategy.\n\n156\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.410\nThere's a course called\nservice transition.\n\n157\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.940\nThere's a book called service transition.\n\n158\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.670\nSo one to one relationship there.\n\n159\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.780\nThe capability modules are based\non a blend of the core books.\n\n160\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.547\nAs an example, service offering agreements\ntakes some from service strategy and\n\n161\n00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:00.146\nsome from service design.\n\n162\n00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:04.200\nAnd mixes them into a practical approach.\n\n163\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.630\nSo, it's more like doing.\n\n164\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.730\nYou get a bit more credit for\nthose as well.\n\n165\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.590\nAnd a little bit deeper dive\ninto the activities involved\n\n166\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.839\nin those specific processes\nthat are being discussed.\n\n167\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.340\nMALC again takes that a step further.\n\n168\n00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.180\nSo, if you're taking a Service Strategy\nExam, or you're taking a Service Offerings\n\n169\n00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.690\nand Agreement Exam,\nyou kinda know the boundaries of the exam.\n\n170\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.600\nIt's just that subject\nmatter you just took.\n\n171\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.130\nMALC is gonna be a bit more challenging\nin that the subject matter is\n\n172\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.470\nall five books all the time.\n\n173\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.060\nAnd how they blend together and how\nthey're distinguishing from each other.\n\n174\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.695\nSo that makes MALC challenging but,\nagain, it also makes it rewarding.\n\n175\n00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:46.430\nBecause you're getting to this practical\nsense of strategically looking\n\n176\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.120\nat ITIL as a strategic asset.\n\n177\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.700\nAnd that's really what we're\ntrying to position MALC for.\n\n178\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.200\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n179\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.341\n&gt;&gt; So\nthe exam itself is virtually the same as\n\n180\n00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:59.384\nthe intermediates you've already taken.\n\n181\n00:09:59.384 --> 00:10:01.940\nExcept there's ten questions and\nnot eight.\n\n182\n00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.680\nAnd one big difference is\nthere's this case study.\n\n183\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.150\nIt's about seven pages long.\n\n184\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.380\nAnd that case study forms the basis for\neight of the ten questions.\n\n185\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.420\nAs many as two of the questions can be\naway from the topic of the case study.\n\n186\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.480\nSo you get eight questions\nassociated with the case study.\n\n187\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.440\nEach question has it's own separate\nscenario in between the case study and\n\n188\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.400\nthe question if you will.\n\n189\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.095\nSo there's that extra\nlayer of Information.\n\n190\n00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:33.045\nCertainly the latter episodes when we\nstart approaching exam preparation.\n\n191\n00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:38.595\nThe latter episodes in this series are\ngonna deal with an approach to taking and\n\n192\n00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:40.245\nmastering this exam technique.\n\n193\n00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:43.155\nWhere you have a case study and\nyou have the scenario.\n\n194\n00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:45.185\nSo we'll get to that in due time.\n\n195\n00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:48.875\nYou get two hours to take the exam.\n\n196\n00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:54.100\nSo ten questions, 120 minutes,\nthat's about 12 minutes per question.\n\n197\n00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.030\nYou don't wanna be learning the case study\nfor the first time when you set this exam.\n\n198\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.870\nThis case study needs to be something\nyou know very well already.\n\n199\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.790\nAnd again, the good news is the same\ncase study that's used in this course\n\n200\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.400\nis the very same case study\nyou'll get on the exam.\n\n201\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.320\nSo there's really no excuse for not\nknowing that case study inside and out.\n\n202\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.780\nKnow it well.\n\n203\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.680\nTherefore, you won't be\nparsing it while you're\n\n204\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.910\nmanaging your time on the real exam.\n\n205\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.690\nVery important there.\n\n206\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.350\nYou still gotta get a 70%.\n\n207\n00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.053\nThat's 35 out of 50, so if you do the math\nhere, again, you gotta get 70%, that's 35.\n\n208\n00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:31.650\nThere's ten questions.\n\n209\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.490\nIf you get six three-point answers,\nthat's 18.\n\n210\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.750\nAnd you got four more to go.\n\n211\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.840\nSo you can get 20 out of that,\nthat's 38, all right.\n\n212\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.400\nSo maybe you can have seven three point\nanswers to get 21 points with three to go,\n\n213\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.530\ngives you the 15.\n\n214\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.930\nKind of do the math there.\n\n215\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.910\nSo perfection is not required,\n70% obviously is not 100%.\n\n216\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.040\nBut if you were to get a zero answer or\n\n217\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.170\na one answer then you're\nmargin of error is shrinking.\n\n218\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.080\nYou gonna have to go find some extra\nfive point answers along the way.\n\n219\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.740\nSo as you approach the exam,\na great approach is to get really good and\n\n220\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.180\neliminating the ones and the zeroes.\n\n221\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.980\nSo that you're always in this little\nwheelhouse of choosing between\n\n222\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.460\nthe best answer and the next best answer.\n\n223\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.670\nIf you're here,\n\n224\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.810\nit's because you've already had some\nsuccess on intermediate level exams.\n\n225\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.830\nSo you know how that row is hoed.\n\n226\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.860\nSo get your hoe out\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.940\n&gt;&gt; And work a little harder.\n\n228\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.738\n&gt;&gt; And I'm from Iowa, and\nbelieve me, you need to be hoeing.\n\n229\n00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:33.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n230\n00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.930\nSo that's kinda the lay of the land.\n\n231\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.710\nThat's the lay of the land,\nwhat you expect.\n\n232\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.720\nOne other big thing is,\nyou're own self study is important.\n\n233\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.420\nYou'll see episode files up above,\nthere's some up above right now.\n\n234\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.774\nAs you look at your episode files,\nyou can download the sample papers.\n\n235\n00:12:46.774 --> 00:12:51.120\nThere are process charts and\nvarious things that can help you study.\n\n236\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.730\nAnd also help you have in front of you\nwhile you're watching these lectures.\n\n237\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.980\nIt's a good visual reference,\nincluding the course handbook.\n\n238\n00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.060\nWhich has the same PowerPoint\nas going through here.\n\n239\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.960\nYou can take notes and whatnot.\n\n240\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.392\nSo I highly encourage you to\ndownload those materials.\n\n241\n00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:09.405\nAnd as you get into each episode,\nyou'll find additional materials for\n\n242\n00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:11.570\nknowledge checks and exercises.\n\n243\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.100\nI highly encourage you to go there.\n\n244\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.144\nAnd as we go through the episodes,\nI'll remind you that they're there and\n\n245\n00:13:16.144 --> 00:13:17.316\nwhat the value of those are.\n\n246\n00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:21.320\nAnd I look forward to seeing you for\nfuture episodes here.\n\n247\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Terry.\n\n248\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.760\nAnd we're gonna be diving really into this\nMALC so, and fortunately its on video.\n\n249\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.610\nYou can watch it again and\nagain and again.\n\n250\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.550\nSo again, thanks again Terry.\n\n251\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be.\n\n252\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.080\n&gt;&gt; And thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n253\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.040\nYou know a good IT Pro is always learning.\n\n254\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.940\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n255\n00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n256\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.974\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n257\n00:13:39.974 --> 00:13:47.110\n[MUSIC]\n\n258\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.687\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",
